For China , the past quarter century has marked the start of a new chapter in the country 's history : the shift from a long bear market to the start of a new bull ; the beginning of a move from the margins of history back toward center stage . <p> China 's decision to scrap its fleets and to dismantle its shipyards in the fifteenth century might be said to mark the beginning of a chapter of inward orientation for China , one of relative decline . With that decision , China effectively passed up on its potential to become a dominant trader and attain global power . China was replete in assets conducive to creating an empire , including population size and technological " firsts , " such as gunpowder , cast iron , paper and printing , the compass , and large oceangoing ships . Instead , China slipped backward and eventually into the chaos of war and political and cultural revolution . <p> China reversed course in the late 1970s when it " opened up " its economy . China now has rebounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least command the attention of the audience : <p>  --  China has a prominent role in the global economy with its soaring trade and foreign direct investment inflows and the centrality of its currency , the renmimbi ( RMB ) , to developments in international currency markets . China is now characterized as " the workshop of the world , " the world 's " marginal producer , " juxtaposed with the United States , the world 's " marginal consumer . " In 2001 , China gained membership in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , which allows China to play in setting global trade rules ( only in part as a developing country , implying China already has started the transition toward a more developed status ) . China surprised many with its constructive technical suggestions for tariff-cutting formulae in the WTO 's Doha Development Agenda. ( n1 ) And its participation ( albeit as silent partner ) in the Group of 20 that coalesced at the Cancun WTO Ministerial in September 2003 hinted at new negotiating dynamics that its presence on the Geneva trade scene has called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade deals point to a future regional role . <p>  --  China 's technological progress , demonstrated with the launch of a manned space flight , provided the financial press an opening to point out the implied inconsistency of China still being considered a developing country ; as The Economist cover stated , " Congratulations , China ( So , No Need for Any More Aid , Then ? ) . " ( n2 ) <p>  --  And , somewhat less conspicuously but of perhaps more immediate significance , China made what London 's Financial Times called a " spectacular return to the international bond market " with a US$1.47 billion issue , the US$-denominated tranche of which was priced comparably to issues by U.S. government agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that carry implicit U.S. government guarantees . China did not need to borrow ; it did so to establish a benchmark  --  and a footprint  --  in the international bond market. ( n3 ) <p> China has come so far , so fast , that instinctively one expects  --  as with any bull market  --  a consolidation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart the future . We have long been familiar with extrapolations of the size of China 's economy that suggest that China might surpass the United States as the world 's largest economy by the middle of the twenty-first century. ( n4 ) But what does that mean for the way China fits into the global economy ( and its political economy ) and for the way the global economy works ? And the flip side of this coin matters as well : What do developments in the global economy portend for China ? Will China have the period of grace to get its internal affairs in order before it takes on the global roles that almost unavoidably go with the size of its economic footprint ? ( n5 ) <p> This article provides a perspective on the key links between China and the global economy at the beginning of what appears to be a new global expansion . This article shows : <p>  --  China has carved out a niche for itself in the global economy exactly as one would expect a labor-rich , capital-poor economy to do : by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notwithstanding its controversial policy of " pegging " its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar , China 's exchange rate is not fixed in real terms , and it has adjusted substantially in real terms through domestic price shifts as expected in an economy reasonably open to trade . <p>  --  Taking into account the shift of Hong Kong 's manufacturing sector to mainland China , the combined trade balance of Hong Kong and China with the rest of the world has remained in rough balance over the course of the business cycle . The recent series of surpluses emerged in 1998 not because of an export surge on the back of a weak currency but through a decrease in imports as a result of the growth slowdown during the Asian crisis  --  and at a time when the exchange rates of both China and Hong Kong were appreciating steeply in real effective terms . <p>  --  Because China controls capital outflows , it is not possible to infer from the buildup of foreign exchange reserves that the market exchange rate equilibrium would be higher than the RMB 's current parity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country such as Japan with an open capital market and a floating exchange rate that is also building up its foreign exchange reserves ) . In China 's case , foreign exchange reserves substitute for the private outflows of capital that would occur under an open capital account as Chinese residents and firms diversified their assets internationally , exactly as foreign economic agents are presently doing by investing in China . <p>  --  The solution to the problem of global imbalances will increasingly involve China , but how China can best contribute needs to be carefully considered . Sustaining its own growth and boosting its imports is clearly the preferable route from the perspective of both China and the world trading community . Proponents of exchange rate flexibility might well consider that China 's per capita international purchasing power at market exchange rates only has started to grow in real terms since it pegged its exchange rate firmly to the dollar . <p> China 's entry into the world economy illustrates the classic win-win proposition of trade : it has added its workshop to the world 's , creating , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although China 's size gives it some of the trappings of an emerging economic power , it remains in many ways a developing economy with major fiscal and financial challenges to meet , technological advances to master , potential bottlenecks ( especially energy and water ) to overcome , and institutional development to undergo before it can become an economic power equal to today 's major industrialized economies . Positioning China in the International Division of Labor <p> The integration of China into the global economy added an immense amount of labor and comparatively little capital to global productive capacity . As a result , the price of labor worldwide fell relative to the price of capital . <p> There was no immediate " shock , " as the integration took place gradually as real-world market connections were painstakingly developed . However , during the 1990s , the pace of integration accelerated steeply , as reflected in the trajectory of China 's trade flows ( see figure 1 ) . This acceleration reflected China 's opening up to inward foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . Thus , Chinese labor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into foreign markets already controlled by multinationals . Improvements in China 's infrastructure and policies that expanded the portion of China 's population that could directly or indirectly tap into the export-oriented job market also played a major role. ( n6 ) <p> North America , Europe , and industrialized Asia out-sourced labor-intensive production to China . Structural adjustment was felt throughout the global economy  --  in China , in other low-wage countries competing for the same FDI , and in the higher-wage countries from which this production was shifted . <p> As labor-intensive manufacturing jobs migrated to China , political pressure rose in industrialized countries to provide protection against Chinese imports and force up China 's exchange rate . But as many have pointed out , a part of China 's bilateral trade surplus with the United States represents profits of U.S. multinational firms exporting back to the United States . Measures that curtailed China 's exports would reduce their profits and undermine the returns to their shareholders and ruin a good business plan . Moreover , even as exports from China were booming , so too were China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also of capital equipment and of consumer goods as purchasing power in China grew . These capital and consumer goods came in part from industrialized countries. ( n7 ) <p> Companies in higher-wage countries that out-sourced labor-intensive work to China also were specializing their own domestic functions toward high-value , capital-intensive niche products and toward research and development , driving innovation. ( n8 ) The demand for skills in those countries rose , putting a premium on wages for skilled workers . And if low-skilled workers saw their wages eroded ( at least in relative terms ) , prices of goods that could be purchased with those reduced wages also decreased because of the low-cost competition emanating out of China. ( n9 ) <p> The reverse was happening in China : China 's domestically oriented , capital-intensive production came under tough competitive pressure and suffered relative decline , even as China 's labor-intensive production expanded . China 's state-owned enterprise sector fell victim to this expansion ; this sector is where the major job destruction occurred . <p> In other words , as the world adjusted to China , China adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's  --  and the world 's to China 's . <p> By the same token , is it fair to ask how much production chain make China an economic " power , " or does it simply strengthen the hand of the multinational firm and further erode the economic significance of the nation-state ? The reality is a bit of both stories . China 's influence on the global division of labor is genuinely pervasive and its development is exciting ; at the same time , it is a bit early to be concerned with China 's global influence . Unfortunately , in recessionary times , the difficulties of structural adjustment are compounded , which has brought China squarely into the line of fire of protectionist rhetoric even as it is reforming to meet the commitments it made in joining the WTO . <p> Adjustment pressures for the rest of the world are eased insofar as China buys as much from the rest of the world as it sells to it . Going by China 's official estimates of its external balance , this was pretty much the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large external surpluses ( see figure 2 ) . <p> These surpluses have provided for many a prima facie case of an undervalued exchange rate . In particular , the large ( if economically meaningless ) bilateral surpluses with the United States have made China 's nominal exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar an important political issue that has spilled over into trade remedy actions. ( n10 ) <p> How Big Are China 's External Surpluses ? <p> Statistical questions cloud every area of analysis of China 's economy , including trade figures . Questions about China 's international trade numbers are connected to Hong Kong acting as an intermediary for China 's international trade . Goods from China often are shipped to Hong Kong for onward shipment to destinations abroad , but en route they are repriced . This reflects a markup for value added in the commercial process in Hong Kong ( for example , export brokerage ) , although suspicions have been raised that under-invoicing of exports also has been a means of avoiding China 's restrictions on outward capital flows , China 's domestic taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide discrepancy between the world 's recorded imports from China and China 's reported exports to the world . For example , in 2002 , China 's trading partners collectively claimed that they imported goods worth US$466 billion , 43 percent more than the US$326 billion that China reported exporting to the world . This discrepancy is far greater than could be accounted for by the costs of freight and insurance . Export values , including costs of transport to the port and costs of handling at the port , are recorded at the point of shipping , whereas imports , including all shipping and insurance charges , are valued at the custom houses of the importing nation . The size of the discrepancy varies widely depending on the distance between two trading partners . A figure of 10 percent is an average that is widely used , including by the IMF. ( n11 ) This falls well short of explaining the discrepancy between export-based and import-based measures of China 's exports . <p> There has arisen , accordingly , a cottage industry to accurately estimate China 's trade balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus Hong Kong as a single trading entity . This approach has the added advantage that it corrects for any illusion regarding China 's trade impact on the rest of the world caused by the considerable shift of light manufacturing from Hong Kong to China. ( n12 ) <p> There are three ways to measure combined China-Hong Kong trade : <p> ( a ) Using China 's and Hong Kong 's reported exports to and imports from the world and subtracting their own estimates of their bilateral trade with each other . To put export-based figures on a comparable basis to imports , the former would need to be boosted by 10 percent . <p> ( b ) Using statistics compiled by the IMF on world imports from China and from Hong Kong less world exports to these two destinations , again subtracting the relevant measures of the bilateral flows between China and Hong Kong and boosting export values by 10 percent . <p> ( c ) Using world import data to measure China 's and Hong Kong 's exports and using the latter 's import data to measure their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No valuation adjustment is required under this approach . <p> Figure 3 shows the evolution of the balance of trade between the world and China and Hong Kong based on these three measures . As can be seen , the measures track each other reasonably well until the end of the 1990s . Although there are notable discrepancies in the actual estimates during this period , all three measures show China-Hong Kong merchandise trade to have been roughly in balance over the course of the 1980s and 1990s , more often with a deficit than with a surplus . The three measures begin to diverge in 2000 , with the divergence becoming serious in 2002 . The import-based measure , which is presumptively the most reliable , suggests that the merchandise trade balance of China-Hong Kong was only modestly in surplus from 2000 through 2002. ( n13 ) As this balance also includes the shift of Hong Kong-based light manufacturing to China , the overall picture simply does not support a theory of a major expansion of China 's trade surplus with the rest of the world . <p> As regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 shows that this reflected compression of imports in China and Hong Kong at the time of the Asian crisis . <p> As can be seen , the balance swung from deficit to surplus in 1998 because world exports to China-Hong Kong dropped US$23 billion , according to China and Hong Kong import statistics , or US$31 billion , according to world export statistics . It did not swing because of an exchange rate-induced surge of exports . In fact , from 1994 through 1996 , when China 's exchange rate was at its lowest point on a real effective basis , world imports from China-Hong Kong and world exports to China-Hong Kong were growing at about the same pace , and the world had a surplus . Consistent with expectations , the data also show the sharp slowdown of growth in two-way trade during the global recession in 2001 and the strengthening growth of two-way trade as the global economy began to recover in 2002 . <p> China 's Nominal Exchange Rate Peg <p> China 's exchange rate , although formally a " managed float , " has been tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of 1994 , when China unified its dual exchange rate regime. ( n14 ) Previously , China 's exchange rate had fallen steeply in nominal and real terms from the time it opened up its economy ( see figure 4 ) . <p> The decline during the 1980s reflected the unrealistically high official exchange rate that China maintained during its closed economy period . But the last wave of devaluation in the early 1990s was associated with a rapid increase in the inflation rate : consumer prices rose by 15 percent , 24 percent , and 17 percent in 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 , respectively. ( n15 ) In all , the price level in China rose approximately 150 percent compared with the level in 1988 ( see figure 5 ) . As a result , while the nominal effective exchange rate continued to devalue steeply from the late 1980s to the beginning of 1994 , the real effective exchange rate began to rise . The actual low point for the RMB in real effective terms was in the second quarter of 1993 , when it bottomed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily ( including in 1994 , when the final major RMB devaluation was made and the dual exchange rate regime was unified ) to reach 125.9 in the first quarter of 2002 , which also marked the U.S. dollar peak . The full trough-to-peak appreciation was 57.6 percent. ( n16 ) This was sufficient to restore China 's real effective exchange rate to its late-1980s level. ( n17 ) <p> In open economies , it is generally understood that devaluing an exchange rate in nominal terms provides only limited and temporary benefits in terms of competitive advantage because the domestic price and wage structure will adjust to world levels in real terms . In other words , a country that devalues its nominal exchange rate and pegs it at an artificially low level to achieve competitive gains will have these gains eroded by higher inflation . In the context of the sustained nominal peg , the higher inflation represents a real appreciation . Conversely , a country that pegs its nominal exchange rate at too high a level will see inflation squeezed out of its economy and deflation occurring to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , it is precisely for this reason that countries with a history of excessive inflation have used a nominal exchange rate peg for stabilization purposes. ( n18 ) The price and real exchange rate dynamics in China following the establishment of the nominal peg in 1994 were in line with this pattern . Hence , there is no basis for a case of an " unfair competitive advantage " deriving from that peg  --  at least until the period from 2002 through 2003 , when China 's real effective exchange rate fell by about 10 percent , in line with the dollar 's global depreciation. ( n19 ) <p> The rise in China 's real effective exchange rate culminated in a period of deflation in China : China 's consumer price index ( CPI ) fell by a net 2 percent over the five-year period ( from 1998 through 2002 ) . Subsequently , as China 's exchange rate depreciated globally , in tandem with the dollar , China has shifted back to inflation . China 's reported CPI growth rose to 1.2 percent in 2003 after a decline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-over-year increase had risen to 3.2 percent. ( n20 ) <p> How flexible are China 's prices ? This question is at the heart of the issue of whether China needs a floating exchange rate , as is almost universally counseled . If China 's internal prices do adjust reasonably quickly to world levels , it is largely immaterial whether China has a fixed or floating nominal exchange rate because the real adjustments required to maintain rough external equilibrium will be accomplished through internal price adjustments . However , if China 's internal prices march to their own drummer , real exchange rate misalignment almost certainly will result at some point , generating pressures and tensions for the trading system . <p> Two-way trade in goods and services was equivalent to 56 percent of China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2002 , with imports of goods and services equivalent to 27 percent . These figures rose substantially in 2003 to 68 percent and 30 percent , respectively. ( n21 ) However , because a large share of China 's imports are production inputs destined for re-export , China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these figures . Moreover , a large share of China 's CPI is accounted for by food prices , the movements of which largely reflect domestic supply shifts rather than import prices . Historically , food price fluctuations driven by local demand and supply conditions have been an important factor in China 's overall inflation trends . Accordingly , the direct impact of import prices on China 's overall domestic price structure would not be especially powerful . <p> Based on these considerations , the evidence cited previously might be a result of coincidence ; alternative explanations for the inflation dynamics might be advanced . Thus : <p>  --  The inflation surge from 1993 through 1995 might be argued as due to the surge of double-digit growth in that period . <p>  --  The rapid disinflation post-1994 might be argued as due to domestic stabilization policies and the sequence of bumper harvests that put downward pressure on China 's food prices . <p>  --  The deflation of the past several years might be argued as due to massive overcapacity and the unending supply of labor pouring into the industrial economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into inflation in 2003 might be argued as due to the expansion of liquidity caused by capital inflows that China 's central bank has not been able to adequately sterilize or due to structural change or harvest shortfalls in the agricultural sector that has reduced over-supply . <p> But these arguments do not alter the fact that China 's inflation rate did offset nominal devaluation ; China 's domestic prices did fall in the wake of the sharp real appreciation and vice versa  --  in other words , without denying the complex array of factors that go into the determination of a national inflation rate , China 's exchange rate and price dynamics behaved as one would expect from a fairly open economy . <p> As for trade effects , from 1994 through 1996 , immediately following the nominal devaluation , a period when competitive advantage would have been greatest , China 's external surplus did not show any signs of expansion . It was not until 1997 and 1998 , following the correction of the RMB in real terms from its evidently undervalued state in the early 1990s , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflation , that the surplus jumps . Moreover , this expansion of the surplus coincided with a period of slowing growth in China when contemporary commentary tended to focus more on the possibility that China would be destabilized by an inability to sustain growth. ( n22 ) Far from being considered undervalued , China 's RMB was widely considered at risk of devaluation to keep China competitive with its Asian competitors . <p> There is nothing impractical about a nominally pegged exchange rate in the context of capital controls and reasonably flexible domestic prices . Given China 's present conditions , this approach can be used to maintain an adequate degree of internal price stability while allowing sufficient real exchange rate adjustments to keep the external accounts in balance . <p> China 's Growing Foreign Exchange Reserves <p> For many observers , perhaps the most compelling indicator of apparent undervaluation of the RMB is the expansion of China 's foreign exchange reserves , which grew to US$403.3 billion at year-end 2003 . Because the acceleration in reserve growth in 2002 and 2003 occurred simultaneously with rapid reserve growth in Japan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent exchange rate appreciation , it is tempting to interpret China 's buildup as being similarly motivated . <p> But China  --  unlike Japan , Korea , and other Asian economies ( Malaysia excepted )  --  has a largely closed capital account with a considerable body of regulation governing the ability of Chinese residents to invest in foreign assets and , to a lesser extent , foreigners ' ability to invest in China . These regulations currently allow only 20 percent of foreign earnings to be retained in foreign currency assets . Foreign exchange generated as export earnings must be deposited in designated mainland banks , which then sell the foreign exchange to the State Administration for Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ) . The same is true of inward foreign and portfolio direct investment ; as these investments are made , the foreign currency proceeds are funneled to SAFE . <p> There is some legal capital outflow , but until 1997 the amounts were very small . At the end of 1996 , China changed rules to liberalize current transactions ; this led to a sharp increase in two-way capital flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded under " other investment " in the balance of payments accounts , and included transactions in currencies , deposits , loans , and trade credits ( see table 2 ) . <p> As payments must balance , if China has a surplus of earnings on its current account plus a significant inflow of foreign direct investment , net foreign exchange flows must be offset in the balance of payments accounts through an outflow . The only private sector alternative to the transactional " other investment " outflows or foreign exchange reserves is illegal outflows ( for example , across the border into Hong Kong or elsewhere , or stashed into the proverbial mattress ) . Accordingly , under a closed capital account , foreign exchange buildup does not per se reflect any judgment by the market on the appropriate valuation of China 's exchange rate  --  the proverbial " sound of one hand clapping , " with the market largely free to determine inflows but not outflows . <p> In this context , it has been argued that the " errors and omissions " line in China 's balance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made regarding the market 's implied valuation of the RMB . The errors and omissions item is included to make the balance of payments actually balance ; therefore , it captures any measurement errors on all of the other items that go into the balance of payments . By its nature , the errors and omissions line should alternate randomly between positive and negative values and have a mean value of zero . Thus , it is noteworthy that in China 's accounts the line has been consistently negative , averaging US$11 billion per year since 1990 and US$17 billion per year from 1995 through 2000 when the U.S. dollar was strengthening globally and contemporary speculation flourished that the RMB would devalue . <p> It is widely believed that the persistence of negative signs on errors and omissions reflected unrecorded capital flight and that the switch to a positive sign in 2002 for the first time since 1989 might reflect a reversal of that black market capital outflow . At the same time , this particular statistic needs to be kept in perspective . The swing in 2002 amounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of US$5 billion to an inflow of US$8 billion ) on gross flows in China 's external accounts of more than US$800 billion . The legal capital outflows enabled by the 1996 current account reforms considerably exceeded the illegal outflows that the errors and omissions line is thought to have embodied ; for example , the swing on errors and omissions in 2002 was dwarfed by the swing of US$65 billion in " other investment " outflows , from an expansion of external assets of US$44 billion in 2000 to a contraction of external assets of US$21 billion in 2001 , not to mention the reverse swing of US$24 billion in 2002 . Accordingly , it is eminently possible that China 's errors and omissions line simply has started to behave as expected , now that a legal pressure valve for capital outflows has been in place for some time . <p> But let us suppose that the reversal does signify speculative capital inflows and that the 2003 figure will be substantially larger . This would still tell us relatively little about the proper valuation of the RMB ; in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errors since 1989 was effectively the equivalent of a built-up short position on the RMB , ( n23 ) the current swing to positive would represent no more than the beginning of the unwinding of that short position . Not until that position is fully wound down would one be justified in arguing that the reversal is in fact a market judgment that the RMB is undervalued and bound to appreciate versus simply admission that speculation on an RMB decline proved to be unfounded . Moreover , there is the question of the direction of causation : is the buildup of foreign exchange reserves a basis for the argument that the RMB should appreciate , or is the public rhetoric about RMB appreciation intensifying the foreign exchange buildup ? <p> China 's Growth : The Real Issue <p> The conundrum in the exchange rate debate is that the appropriate " market " exchange rate for the RMB might be ( a ) higher , reflecting China 's current account surpluses since 1997 and growth in foreign exchange reserves ; ( b ) about right , on the basis of the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildup of China 's external surpluses in the post-Asian crisis period , the shift of China into modest deflation after 1997 , and the recent strength of import growth ; or ( c ) lower , given the likelihood of increased private sector capital outflows under an open capital market as RMB deposit-holders seek to diversify their asset positions . <p> The case is inconclusive . The simplest thesis for all of the observed developments is China 's shift into trade surplus since 1997 was the result of a pronounced growth slowdown occurring simultaneously with the global appreciation of the RMB along with the U.S. dollar at the time of the Asian crisis . The combined trade surplus of China and Hong Kong ( measured by world imports from these two customs territories versus China and Hong Kong 's imports from the rest of the world ) remained modest through the end of 2002 . China initially imported disinflationary pressure because of the dollar peg ; as its inflation rate fell faster than its nominal interest rates , real interest rates rose in China , further dampening demand and muting import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that started after the first quarter of 2002 , China has " imported " the expansionary U.S. monetary policy and thus has entered a phase of accelerating growth , which has , together with higher import prices , started to generate some inflationary pressure , as evidenced by the shift of China 's CPI into positive growth . Analysts who are suspicious of China 's official national accounts and track China 's growth based on underlying indicators , such as transportation and power usage and the near 40 percent growth of imports in 2003 , suggest that China 's real growth in 2003 was well above the reported 9.1 percent. ( n25 ) If this growth surge continues , China would likely flip from an external surplus to a deficit even without nominal currency realignment . <p> Should China adopt a more flexible exchange rate regime ? One can , after all , disagree with the proposition that China 's currency is deeply undervalued and still agree that there might be advantages to China adopting a more flexible exchange rate regime . However , there is no clear-cut answer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RMB : <p> ( a ) It would facilitate the global adjustment of the U.S. dollar by allowing East Asian economies to appreciate as a group without unduly disturbing their own cross-parities . <p> ( b ) In the short term it would help prevent overheating China 's domestic economy ( a risk thought to derive primarily from over-investment , which generates excess capacity and might lead to an Asian crisis-style crash ) or the buildup of an asset price bubble , as China is already having trouble sterilizing capital inflows . In the long run , this would prepare China for a freely floating exchange rate regime , consistent with the practice of other major economies . <p> What the " more flexible regime " would be is not entirely clear . There is general consensus that China could not actually manage a floating exchange rate regime with an open capital account at this time. ( n26 ) The key concern is that China might experience capital flight given the problems in its banking system . Even proponents of a nominal revaluation of the RMB hesitate to recommend opening China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RMB to plummet. ( n27 ) These concerns have resulted in the balance of opinion in the revaluation school shifting toward maintaining a peg but raising the dollar price of the RMB , either through a one-time revaluation or on a gradual , incremental basis ( that is , through a " crawling peg " ) , leaving flotation and capital market opening to a future date when China 's domestic banking system has been put in sound functional order . <p> A number of arguments can be advanced against both of these standard propositions . <p> First , although China 's exchange rate peg is said to be hampering global adjustment , financial market participants are marveling at how orderly the dollar 's adjustment has been from its overvalued state at the beginning of 2002 . Because China 's peg has prompted massive intervention on behalf of the dollar by other East Asian economies , it has arguably been instrumental in ensuring an orderly correction and preventing overshooting . <p> Second , China is scarcely experiencing overheating in the usual meaning of high and accelerating inflation : China 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of net deflation . But even if its inflation rate were to increase ( as the year-end inflation rate of 3.2 percent indicates is likely ) , it is not clear that this would be an immediate problem . Even on theoretical grounds , China should be able to have somewhat higher levels of measured inflation while still maintaining its competitiveness , because China 's overall inflation rate reflects spillover of the higher prices and wages in the coastal region ( which is heavily exposed to trade and thus is experiencing high productivity growth ) into the interior regions. ( n28 ) Indeed , given the source of the inflation acceleration in 2003 ( higher food prices ) , the rise in China 's CPI reflects a welcome rise in incomes in its interior regions . <p> Third , even if interpreting " overheating " in terms of asset price inflation , the real risk of an asset price bubble comes from a rising nominal exchange rate . For example , in the case of both Japan and the United States , the formation of their respective bubbles occurred in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital flows in and the currency rises , domestic interest rates tend to fall . In the first instance , this fuels the capital investment needed by domestic firms to stay internationally competitive , but it also stimulates asset price inflation . Foreign investors find they are making money not only on their investments but from currency appreciation as well ; this stimulates more capital inflows ( or reduces domestic capital outflows ) , intensifying the cycle . At some point , it becomes difficult to find profitable capital investment opportunities because the price of local factors of production ( land and labor ) are significantly overpriced ; at this final stage , further investment is channeled into assets , marking the beginning of the final phase of euphoric madness that characterizes the peak of the bubble . <p> Fourth , implicit in the argument that nominal appreciation is an appropriate response to speculative capital inflows is that there should be a temporary misalignment of prices on currently traded goods and services . This would be corrected eventually in one of two ways : ( a ) a real depreciation caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traded sector ; or ( b ) an eventual nominal depreciation when the speculative inflows abate . For China , these eventualities ( deflation , employment slowdown , and eventual depreciation ) might be worse than those avoided by nominal appreciation . <p> Fifth , the advantage of a well-established peg to the U.S. dollar is that prices and costs in China are tuned to prevailing international levels and are not distorted by swings in nominal exchange rates common to even well-managed currencies under the floating exchange rate regime . The literature shows that convergence of developing countries to industrial country incomes has been episodic in nature , largely limited to the era of the international gold standard and the gold-backed dollar of the Bretton Woods framework. ( n29 ) China 's sustained growth in international purchasing power in per capita terms does not date back to 1979 when it opened up its economy ; it dates back to the mid-1990s when it was able to establish a sustainable peg to the U.S. dollar ( see figure 6 ) . <p> As a result of inability to grow per capita incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , China has not done well in narrowing the per capita income gap with the United States . For example , in 1979 , China 's per capita income was 2.4 percent of that in the United States ; in 2002 , it was 2.7 percent of the level in the United States ( see figure 7 ) . <p> China 's slow pace of convergence contrasts with Japan 's rapid convergence during the Bretton Woods era , a period during which Japan was able to maintain a fixed nominal exchange rate to the U.S. dollar . In 1952 , Japan 's per capita GDP was 9.3 percent of the prevailing level in the United States ; by 1971 , the year of the collapse of Bretton Woods , it had reached 40.9 percent of the level in the United States ( see figure 8 ) . ( n30 ) <p> Finally , as China has a high domestic savings rate ( consistently close to 40 percent of its GDP ) , it is possible for China to have domestic savings exceed domestic investment and , thus , a structural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , revaluation of the RMB would have only a minor effect on trade flows because of the high import content of China 's exports  --  only the net value-added in China would be repriced by a revaluation . Accordingly , it would take a large revaluation to make a dent in the trade balance , and such a large revaluation might well be disruptive . <p> China can best contribute to world economic development by serving as a strong engine of growth and absorbing imports while rigorously implementing its WTO-commitments to remove trade-distorting features of its domestic economic policy framework ( for example , export tax rebates that contribute to external surpluses while weakening China 's fiscal position ) . ( n31 ) The argument for tinkering with exchange rates is simply not well founded . China As a Rising Economic Power <p> The notion that some countries are " economic powers " is often used in loose discussion of the global economy . As economic theory deals with purely economic objectives , such as economic wellbeing and efficiency of production , other disciplines are studied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links between the expansion of a nation 's productive capacity and its ability to project its military power ; conversely , the ability to project military power is seen as a factor in supporting economic growth by , for example , ensuring access to foreign markets. ( n32 ) Historically , nations that attained sufficient productivity to be able to afford large standing armies and to equip them with technologically advanced machinery of war became " great powers " and extended their military and economic sway outside their own borders , exacting tribute or controlling natural resources and markets for their own goods. ( n33 ) <p> The United States is presently unchallenged in its role as global hegemon . Its GDP comprises one-third of the global economy ; it has effective command of the global commons of sea , air , and space ; ( n34 ) and it has a military budget that in 2003 ( US$397.5 billion as approved by Congress ) was larger than the military spending of the next twenty-five nations combined ( most of whom are U.S. allies ) , ( n35 ) effectively ensuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one-tenth that of the U.S. economy ; its entire government revenue of US$232 billion ( n36 ) in 2002 is dwarfed by the Pentagon budget alone , and it has long-run fiscal problems in terms of dealing with the bad debt in its banking system and its unfunded social security requirements that make the current U.S. budgetary pressures pale in comparison . <p> It would take four decases under optimistic assumptions for China to match the United States in terms of overall economy size. ( n37 ) But long before such an eventuality would bring into close focus issues of great power rivalry , predicted by some thinkers , ( n38 ) China will have been transformed by the environmental , social , and political implications of such a profound economic transformation  --  not to mention the changed " facts on the ground " in terms of the technological and institutional ( that is , multinational corporate ) framework in which China 's economic evolution will take place . <p> The metrics of economic power are unclear ; in this modern ( or perhaps postmodern ) world , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicate the use of power that economic achievement bestows , a well-established multilateral trading system allows nations to buy the technology they do not produce ( or to attract it via inward foreign direct investment ) , and in which multinational corporations rather than nation-states dominate markets and reap profits that may or may not be taxable by the governments in which their head office is domiciled . <p> Is China becoming or on the verge of becoming such an economic power ? And , if so , how would that power be measured ? <p> Market Size <p> The possession of a large domestic market that is capable of absorbing large amounts of imported goods provides a country with considerable leverage in world affairs because other nations become dependent on exporting to it . This theory presupposes that the country is willing to open that market and to deny access selectively to exercise that leverage . <p> This supposition describes the United States : it has the largest domestic market in the world ; it is by far the most open market in the world ( in the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the external deficit of the United States suffices to prove ) ; and although it observes the rules of the WTO and other trade agreements , such as the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , which curtail the ability to mount arbitrary trade actions , the United States retains powerful trade remedy tools that it frequently deploys . The possession of this form of economic power gives the United States leverage in other spheres , as illustrated in the formation of the coalition that prosecuted the war in Iraq ; in this instance , the carrot of free trade with the United States was used as an incentive to encourage participation . <p> China has the potential to become an economic power ; to some extent , this potential has been realized . China is one of the world 's large importers , even taking into account that a large part of its imports are intended for re-export after processing . China recently has shown preparedness to underwrite regional economic integration agreements ( for example , the proposed free trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Southeast Asian trading partners ) . China also has been active in announcing bilateral trade agreements . China 's domestic demand for goods is making itself felt in world commodity prices ( especially base metals ) , a good indicator of economic weight . <p> However , although China 's potential as a market power is undoubted , it has not yet fully arrived . Outside of the export-oriented coastal areas , its economy is not large in market terms and there is still a generation 's worth of growth and building a consumer class before it rivals the domestic purchasing power of the United States , Europe , or Japan . Moreover , its dependence on exports , which is far greater than that of the United States , Europe , or Japan , counterbalances any leverage that it can exercise through controlling access to its own markets , demonstrated by the terms of China 's accession to the WTO , which were considered less favorable to China than for many other applicants . <p> Export Power <p> Control over strategic exports , such as oil or high technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation with a wellspring of influence in noneconomic domains . China , however , basically exports its labor , which is abundant and cheap . Conversely , China is highly dependent on energy imports and purchases much of its advanced military equipment from Russia . <p> Financial Center <p> A hallmark of a major economic power is the supply of an international currency . During Great Britain 's tenure as the dominant global economic power , pound sterling was the world 's benchmark currency ; during the tenure of the United States , the dollar has played that role . Germany 's deutschemark played a more limited but similar role as the anchor for European currencies from the end of the Bretton woods era to the launch of the eruo in 1999 . Providing an international currency gives important advantages to a country but also subjects it to considerable stresses , as demonstrated by the tensions in today 's global economy surrounding the buildup of U.S. dollar holdings abroad . This buildup is associated with the widening of the U.S. trade deficit , pressures in the currency markets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange rates and firms execute complex hedging strategies . <p> China is not yet close to having its currency assume a major international role . The RMB is not internationalized . China has only established a small benchmark presence in the international bond market and has a relatively thin domestic bond market . Its banking system , burdened with nonperforming loans , is not yet sufficiently robust to withstand the pressures that would flow into China from outside its borders via the RMB were the latter to serve as a regional currency or as a conduit for Chinese investment and financial flows abroad. ( n39 ) The political situation in East Asia is not conducive to the establishment of a regional currency framework on a plurilateral basis , a context in which the RMB could be partly internationalized toward a wider international role. ( n40 ) <p> Institutional Considerations <p> With accession to the WTO , China is now a member of all the important global institutions as well as of the Asia-Pacific institutions , such as APEC and ASEM , which emphasize economic dialog and provide an opportunity for political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forum for dialog on security issues ; and the Chiang Mai Initiative , which instituted currency swap arrangements to strengthen regional support against speculative attacks on member currencies. ( n41 ) China is also a member of the G-20 , a group of " systemically important " economies that was formed in the wake of the Asian and wider emerging market crisis to consider ways to mitigate future international financial market instability , and of the other " group of 20 "  --  in this case , WTO members that coalesced as a negotiating group at the Cancun WTO ministerial . China has been slow to join the trend to regional preferential trade deals , although it seems to be tilting in that direction given the negotiations under way with ASEAN and the tentative talks with Japan and South Korea . Developments to liberalize trade with Taiwan , the largest gap in China 's trade pattern , move at a glacial pace . <p> The only economic institutional link that China might seriously covet in the near term would be membership in the G7/8 , the group of leading industrial countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy coordination . China 's importance in the global economy unavoidably brings it into consideration when contemplating the appropriate membership of this group ; at the same time , its underdeveloped financial and capital markets and the transitional nature of its economy lead many analysts to doubt the benefits that either China or the incumbents would obtain from China joining the routine global economic surveillance discussions . As institutions evolve to reflect the world in which they are embedded , it is only a matter of time before China becomes part of whatever group functions in this capacity  --  although how near that point of time the country might be is not something analysis can predict . <p> China is joining existing institutions and seeking to play a constructive role within those institutions rather than spearheading the formation of new institutions . Conclusion <p> China has come a remarkable distance in the past quarter century , and it is on a trajectory to go much further in the next twenty-five years . It has already become hard to talk about developments in the global economy these days without taking China into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its economy and financial system mature . <p> Economic projections make it the ( still distant ) heir apparent to the title of world 's largest economy . For the United States , such projections , as well as the strategic issues raised by China 's space ambitions , will intertwine with considerations of the importance of having China as a partner in managing global economic affairs . The China-United States relationship has been one of the most complex and will grow more complex . <p> Has China become the workshop of the world ? That would be a vast overstatement . China is carving out a niche  --  a large niche  --  in the international division of labor . But properly considered , it is buying about as much as it sells . It is more accurate to say that China has added its workshop to the world 's  --  to the benefit of both . China has not yet built on its well-established central role in the international division of labor and in the trading system to become a technological or financial power . Its banks and corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in time . <p> The laws of geoeconomic gravity likely will be fulfilled in due course , but there is a generation 's worth of work to be done before that is a reality . It is premature to burden China with labels that are little more than rhetorical flights of fancy and detract from , rather than add to , a fact-based understanding of its current situation in the global economy . <p>
