This is n't Mike Krzyzewski 's deepest or most productive team , but Duke has the most title-worthy tools in the tournament Headnote SCOUTING THE TOURNAMENT // We have come to Year 19 . When this royal blue reign began , Lou Carnesecca , John Thompson and Dean Smith were coaching , David Robinson , Brad Daugherty and Danny Manning were playing without pay , and Luol Deng had just been born . The current Duke dynasty has not burned as brightly as the one created by UCLA under John Wooden , but it now has endured nearly twice as long . In the past 18 years , Duke has accumulated 17 NCAA appearances , nine Final Fours , seven No. 1 seeds , three national championships and 59 tournament victories . The Blue Devils ' perseverance has earned them a national audience , but also a legion of detractors weary of their extended stay on stage . And Duke will continue to enchant and aggravate those who watch them in this tournament , as the Devils prepare to claim their fourth NCAA title under Mike Krzyzewski . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooters , Deng could make them pay . Photograph If teams pay too much attention to Duke 's shooters , Deng could make them pay . Duhon 's two-way dominance is a big reason Krzyzewski is in line for another title run . // They will win because in this most peculiar season , they remain the team with the most-and most potent-offensive and defensive assets : wings JJ . Redick and Daniel Ewing make just under five 3pointcrs per game ; center Shelden Williams overpowers single coverage and averages 3.1 blocks ; point guard Chris Duhon is in complete command at both ends of the floor ; Deng , a 6-8 freshman forward , is the most gifted prospect in the college game . This is not Duke 's deepest team , with the rotation down to seven players and occasional cameos from senior big man Nick Horvath . This is not Duke 's most productive offensive machine , but there are five double-figure scorers . This is not Duke 's best defensive team-but it is close . Only the great 1999 team , which lost to Connecticut in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one Krzyzewski team has yielded fewer points . This is not Duke 's most precise team , but it has been mostly synchronized . " If there are five radios playing , " says Davidson coach Bob McKillop , " they 're all playing the same station . " However , there are several obstacles between Duke and a championship , and not just those named Saint Joseph 's , Stanford , Kentucky and Oklahoma State . The " foul ' line . Williams " long arms and massive strength make him a terrifying interior defender , but he 's of little concern sitting on the bench . Williams averaged 25.5 minutes and four fouls in Duke 's four losses against ACC opponents . he had at least three fouls in nine of Duke 's last 10 games . Sophomore Shavlik Randolph is a capable reserve , but he is n't as comfortable playing in place of Williams as when the two work together . In those four ACC losses , playing mostly as the sole big man , Randolph averaged 2.5 points and 2.0 rebounds in 14.8 minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points on long-range shots . Among top 10 teams , only Saint Joseph 's gets a larger chunk of its offense from 3s . Duke 's 2001 championship team shot even more 3-pointers . The difference is that squad had five players who made at least 40 ; a significant majority of this team 's deep shots come from Ewing and Redick . If those two are sufficiently defended or just plain off in a given game , Duke could find itself in jeopardy . The finish line . The most obvious difference between games Duke wins and games it loses is Deng 's ability to finish plays . Few frontcourt defenders are quick enough to cut off Deng 's drives , but that is of little significance if he does n't drop the ball in the goal . When opposing defenses extend to challenge Redick and Ewing on the perimeter , they are vulnerable to Deng attacking the basket . There are times , though , when he leaves a lot of those balls on the rim . In the Devils ' five defeats , he shot 33.8 percent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The NCAA has staged two Final Fours since the last time Duke was involved . Hard as it may be to believe , that 's the second-longest absence since the Krzyzewski era truly arrived with Duke 's appearance in the 1986 championship game . The " drought " will end later this month , and a title will follow . And then the Blue Devils will prepare to extend their royal blue reign to a 20th season . It may end at some point , but it 's hard to see that day coming soon . We 're all undefeated now For 1,040 minutes , Stanford remained perfect . The Cardinal only needed another 40 to finish the job . " It would have been nice to win all your games , just because there it was , " says Stanford coach Mike Montgomery . " I do n't know when you 're ever going to get in a situation like that again . " Stanford fumbled its chance to enter the Pac-10 Tournament undefeated when it lost by 13 at Washington on the first Saturday in March . Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Hawks were crushed by Xavier in the Atlantic 10 Tournament quarterfmals . Both Stanford and St. Joe 's , however , might have reanimated their potential to claim the 2004 NCAA tide . Only seven teams in the tournament 's history have finished as unbeaten champions . That 's out of 17 teams that entered the field with perfect records . Only one team-UNLV in 1991-has carried an undefeated season as far as the Final Four since the explosion of media interest that developed two decades ago . That squad lost to Duke in the national semifinals . The pressure of remaining undefeated was starting to wear on the Stanford players . " Looking at the tapes of the Washington and Washington State games , we sure did n't look like the team we were for most of the year , " says Montgomery , whose team struggled past Washington State , 63-61 , on the road before the loss at Washington . " We looked tired , just did n't have the energy of either of the teams we played against . Now , was that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure . " Saint Joseph 's operated against Xavier without the little-guy passion that allowed the Hawks to storm through such teams as Boston College , Villanova and Gonzaga . Xavier guard Lionel Chalmers figures his team did the Hawks a favor . " It 's better for them to lose so they get a loss out of the way going into the tournament , " he says . " I really think they are one of the best teams in the country . They made history with what they did . " Bouncing wer a CIiff When Kentucky point guard Cliff Hawkins watches other college games , he does not wonder why he so often sees point guards relentlessly pounding the ball into the floor-killing ants , as one coach used to call it . Hawkins has been there . " I had a little dribbleitis when I first came here , " says Hawkins , a senior . " But once you learn , get more experience , you learn you do n't have to dribble the air out of the ball to be a point guard . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The beauty of Hawkins " development is that he now can dominate a game without dominating the ball . It 's in his hands as long as it needs to be . Then , he passes to a teammate or takes a shot ( which , given his 29 3-pointers , is not as bad a result as it once was ) . Hawkins averages 5.3 assists , a nice total . But Kentucky gets assists on an impressive 58.5 percent of its baskets because he allows the Wildcats ' other fine passers to be involved . The willingness to share the basketball has been Kentucky 's greatest asset in compiling more victories over RPI top 50 teams during the regular season than any team except Duke . A close second would be the Wildcats ' defense , which lacks a great shot blocker but does have Hawkins harassing ballhandlers . " When Cliff is pressuring a guy , he 's looking to pass it and give it up , " says UK power forward Chuck Hayes . " So you really have to get on your guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step up . " Photograph Smith and his school are small , but they have produced supersized numbers . // Please allow me to introduce myself You may not get a long look at all these players , but they 're worth checking out : Tim Smith , PG , East Tennessee State . At 5-9 , Smith is electrically quick and involved with everything . Starting with a win over Fresno State , Smith averaged 26.3 points and 5.7 assists in a 5-1 surge through ETSU 's final six games . he also averaged 3.8 turnovers . " You have to let him go , give him freedom , " says Buccaneers coach Murry Bartow . " He is as fast with the ball as anyone . " Ben Jacobson , SG , Northern Iowa . One of Greg McDermott 's first accomplishments after becoming Panthers coach was securing a commitment from Jacobson-the best player on a high school team that featured future Iowa Hawkeyes Greg Brunner and Jeff Horner . Jacobson is athletic , works relentlessly to get open and hits 39.8 percent of his 3-point attempts . Antione @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-major version of Pittsburgh 's Jaron Brown . This season , he has produced 19 double-figure scoring games , 18 games of seven-plus rebounds and 17 games of three or more assists . At 6-5,245 , Whelchel is powerful enough to defend frontcourt players but quick enough to be a factor on the perimeter . Photograph Freije Photograph Other schools did n't want Dudley , but he has made a quick impact for the Eagles . // Luis Flores , SG , Manhattan . Including him on a list such as this is as predictable as putting Citizen Kane on a list of great motion pictures . But Flores has gone off for 30 or more six times since January 1 . Who could get tired of watching that ? Unappreciated but not uninvited Perhaps there 's a sense of symmetry to Boston College coach Al Skinner routinely being overlooked while accomplishing so much with overlooked players . That does n't make it right . The simple fact is getting this BC team to the NCAA Tournament firmly establishes Skinner as one of the great college coaches . Skinner will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams have included future pros , such as Rhode Island 's Cuttino Mobley and EC 's Troy Bell but almost never an elite recruit . Skinner finds players others miss or undervalue and molds them into outstanding teams . It once seemed BC would be doomed to failure upon entering the ACC in a couple of years , but if Skinner can endure what he encountered this season , he can handle himself in the ACC . Late last summer , Boston College unexpectedly lost veterans Ryan Sidney and Andrew Bryant and forward recruit Dan Coleman . That left BC-19-12 last year but snubbed by the NCAA selection committee-with one returning player who had averaged more than a half-dozen points . Skinner went out and found unsigned 6-7 forward Jared Dudley in August ; Dudley has averaged 12.2 points and 6.7 rebounds and became an all-freshman choice in the Big East . " It 's just really giving them an opportunity , " Skinner says . " There are a lot of talented players . They just need a chance to play . I think it has more to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit into our system , and we hope we find a young man who will recognize that . " A final exam If you can pass this test , you surely are ready to study Coaching Principles and Strategies of Basketball at the University of Georgia . All questions are true or false : 1 . Emeka Okafor 's back injury will be the focal point of the NCAA Tournament . True . For as long as Connecticut is able to continue . Okafor is a unanimous All-American choice and will be among the first picks in the NBA draft . At his best , he can carry UConn to the title game . Diminished by spasms , he can be outplayed by Syracuse 's Craig Forth . 2 . Salim Stoudamire 's recent suspension will damage Arizona . False . Although that episode might have cost the Wildcats a home victory over Washington-coach Lute Olson has come right out and said it did-it was a minor matter that is behind both player and team . Stoudamire is back to being what he is : a volatile scorer who can bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoots in rhythm . 3 . Florida ca n't go far with Billy Donovan 's coaching . False . As Donovan himself admitted , his recent problems have been in recruiting , supposedly his specialty . He 's the one who signed so many guys who are selfish and meek . Donovan needs to reevaluate his player evaluations. 4 . You want Oklahoma State coach Eddie Button on your bench . True . You know he has coached OSU and Arkansas to Final Fours . But there 's more . His teams have played in three other Elite Eights and are 33-24 ( .579 ) in NCAA play . Nobody is better at getting players to run the system . 5 . As many as 16 or 17 teams are capable of winning the NCAA championship . False . There are closer to seven or eight . Unless this season sets new precedents , the eventual champion will have one or two NBA-caliber players , a capable point guard and a dynamic wing scorer . There may be a team with those qualities buried near 16th or 17th in the rankings-say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranked above the Tar Heels can win it all . 6 . This has been a dreadful season for college basketball . True . And false . The quality of play has been poor . The Big Ten and Pac-10 were well below their standards-honestly , below the typical standards of the Atlantic 10 . There were more great teams and great players last season . This year 's NCAA field includes at-large selections that would not have made any previous tournament . Game to game , however , the competition was terrific . Stanford and Saint Joseph 's fascinated fans by maintaining unbeaten seasons into March . The NCAA Tournament should be thrilling . Again . Sidebar Ragging on the lags is a drag Too much of the analysis on Gonzaga goes no deeper than this : Ils conference competition is n't very good . Well , yeah , lint now that the Bulldogs have their aulomatie hid and have been assigned their region and seed , that no longer matters . They must address real concerns : Handling ball pressure . Senior Blake Stepp has had an All-American-lype season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaging 14.9 points and 6.9 assists . But even though he 's an excellent playmaker , he still does not respond well Io intense defense on the hall . Il Gon/aga laces a point guard defender at the level of a Jamecr Nelson or Chris Duhon , it might need someone other than Stepp to advance the hall . Dealing with Size . Center Cory Violette shot 56.8 percent from the field , but his history of struggling to score against big-time power players goes back to the Zags ' 2002 NCAA Tournament loss to Wyoming . Against Maryland , Missouri and Stanford this season , Violette shot 5-for-26 . The Zags need better from him . Containing penetration . Gonzaga 's defense has been belter this season , at times even excellent . With greater reliance on a 2-3 zone , it has held opponents to 38.4 percent shooting . And that 's not just because the Bulldogs compete in the West Coast Conference . The Zags ' seven major-conference opponents fared slightly worse ( 38.3 percent ) . It might not be fair to question the Zags in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them enough to justify a little skepticism. - M.D . Photograph Stepp Sidebar Step into the tent A player who signs at Kentucky or Arizona figures he 'll be in the tournament each year he plays in college . But that 's not the case for every player . These guys waited a while to fulfill that dream : Andre Barrett , PG , Selon Hall . Barrett has produced 1,834 points and 651 assists in four seasons with the Pirates , but this will be his first NCAA Tournament appearance after enduring last year 's snub and disappointing records his first two seasons . " They say the experience is greater than anything in college basketball , " Barrett says . " I 'm looking forward to it . " Matt Freije , PF , Vanderbilt . With 1,839 points , Freije is Vanderbilt 's career scoring leader and a first-team AIl-SEC selection . The Commodores ' last NCAA trip came in 1997 , three years before he enrolled . John Lucas , PG , Oklahoma State . At the rate the Cowboys are going , Lucas would have to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did while a two-year starter at Baylor . Jawad Williams , PF , North Carolina . This is another of those places recruits expect to make annual NCAA appearances . In his third season as a Tar Heels forward , Williams finally will get there .
