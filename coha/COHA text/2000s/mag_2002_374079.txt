The rap world had better be careful . It is getting dangerously close to mainstream acceptance . Eminem 's movie , 8 Mile , won raves from stuffy , middle-aged film critics and raced to the top of the box-office charts . Now Russell Simmons ' Def Poetry Jam has barged its way onto Broadway . An evening of in-your-face street poetry by nine performers with noms de rap like Black Ice , Georgia Me and Poetri might seem to have an uphill battle in the land of Rodgers and Hammerstein . But the show , being marketed to urban audiences and sporting a relatively low $65 top ticket price , is attracting young , multicultural crowds that Broadway rarely sees . And most of the stuffy theater critics liked it too . <P> So did this one . Simmons and director Stan Lathan have assembled a fast-paced , highly charged evening that manages the rare feat of satisfying insiders while introducing outsiders to something revelatory . The first thing to notice about Def Poetry Jam is that the audience is engaged more directly and passionately ( shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connects ) than any other on Broadway . The second thing to notice , especially after the gangsta-posturing insult raps of 8 Mile , is how empowering , often funny and always life affirming the words are . <P> Aside from a couple of political rants , these two-and three-minute bursts of verse mostly look inward : at the pain of love , the poignance of failed dreams , the lure of Krispy Kreme doughnuts . An abused woman exhorts herself to " hit like a man . " An Asian American celebrates his ethnic group : " We are programming your websites , making your executives look smart . " There 's the fable of Shine , a stoker on the Titanic who " jumped his black ass into the dark sea " and cheerfully swam home while the rich folks drowned . And a cry against the exploitative record industry : " F a record deal . God gives me what I 'm worth . " They might not approve of the words , but Rodgers and Hammerstein would recognize the sentiment .  --  By Richard Zoglin   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
