THERE ARE SOME MEN who enter a woman 's life and screw it up forever . Joseph Morelli did this to me  --  not forever , but periodically . Morelli and I were both born and raised in a blue-collar chunk of Trenton called the burg . Houses were attached and narrow . Yards were small . Cars were American . The people were mostly Italian descent , with enough Hungarians and Germans thrown into offset inbreeding . It was a good place to buy calzone or play the numbers . And . if you had to live in Trenton anyway , it was an okay place to raise a family . When I was a kid I did n't ordinarily play with Joseph Morelli . He lived two blocks over and was two years older . " Stay away from those Morelli boys , " my mother had warned me . " They 're wild . I hear stories about the things they do to girls when they get them alone . " " What kind of things ? " I 'd eagerly asked . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . " Terrible things . Things that are n't nice . " From that point on , I viewed Joseph Morelli with a combination of terror and prurient curiosity that bordered on awe . Two weeks later , at the age of six , with quaking knees and a squishy stomach , I followed Morelli into his father 's garage on the promise of learning a new game . The Morelli garage hunkered detached and snubbed at the edge of their lot . It was a sorry affair , lit by a single shaft of light filtering through a grime-coated window . Its air was stagnant , smelling of corner must , discarded tires , and jugs of used motor oil . Never destined to house the Morelli cars , the garage served other purposes . Old man Morelli used the garage to take his belt to his sons , his sons used the garage to take their hands to themselves , and Joseph Morelli took me , Stephanie Plum , to the garage to play train . " What 's the name of this game ? " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , down on his hands and knees , crawling between my legs , his head trapped under my short pink skirt . " You 're the tunnel , and I 'm the train . " I suppose this tells you something about my personality . That I 'm not especially good at taking advice . Or that I was born with an overload of curiosity . Or maybe it 's about rebellion or boredom or fate . At any rate , it was a one-shot deal and darn disappointing , since I 'd only gotten to be the tunnel , and I 'd really wanted to be the train . Ten years later , Joe Morelli was still living two blocks over . He 'd grown up big and bad , with eyes like black fire one minute and melt-in-your-mouth chocolate the next . He had an eagle tattooed on his chest , a tight-assed , narrow-hipped swagger , and a reputation for having fast hands and clever fingers . My best friend , Mary Lou Molnar , said she heard Morelli had a tongue like a lizard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that supposed to mean ? " " Just do n't let him get you alone or you 'll find out . Once he gets you alone ... that 's it . You 're done for . " I had n't seen much of Morelli since the train episode . I supposed he 'd enlarged his repertoire of sexual exploitations . I opened my eyes wide and leaned closer to Mary Lou , hoping for the worst . " You are n't taking about rape , are you ? " " I 'm talking about lust ! If he wants you , you 're doomed . The guy is irresistible . " Aside from being fingered at the age of six by you-know-who , I was untouched . I was saving myself for marriage , or at least for college . " I 'm a virgin , " I said , as if this was news . " I 'm sure he does n't mess with virgins . " " He specializes in virgins ! The brush of his fingertips turns virgins into slobbering mush . " Two weeks later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after school , Tasty Pastry , on Hamilton . He bought a chocolate-chip cannoli , told me he 'd joined the navy , and charmed the pants off of me four minutes after closing , on the floor of Tasty Pastry , behind the case filled with chocolate eclairs . The next time I saw him , I was three years older . I was on my way to the mall , driving my father 's Buick when I spotted Morelli standing in front of Giovichinni " s Meat Market . I gunned the big V-8 engine , jumped the curb , and clipped Morelli from behind , bouncing him off the front right fender . I stopped the car and got out to asses the damage . " Anything broken ? " He was sprawled on the pavement , looking up my skirt . " My leg . " " Good , " I said . Then I turned on my heel , got into the Buick , and drove to the mall . I attribute the incident to temporary insanity , and in my own defense , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since .
