Chapter One An hour before Sam Remington graduated from high school fifteen years ago , he stuffed the sum of his belongings into three grocery sacks and flung them onto the back seat of his 1977 oil-eating Pacer . Five minutes after the ceremony ended he made his final trip through town , his tailpipe spewing a noxious farewell of good riddance . Today he returned in a black Mercedes so new it did n't have plates . He 'd paid cash for it . But Sam was n't here to advertise his success to the people he left behind . Normally he was n't one to dwell on the past . Today was different . He 'd chosen the day of his return to his hometown specifically . Certainly he could have come another time . Maybe should have . But news of his fifteen-year high-school reunion set the date for him . Some unfinished business of his had gone ignored for too long . He had two people to see . He 'd just come from seeing the first one . Now he would deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Camp , a community of 3,100 people nestled in the Northern California foothills of the Sierra Nevadas . He kept his gaze straight ahead as he passed the turnoff leading to the house where he was raised - the house from which he 'd escaped - although the unusually cool August evening took him back to the nights of his childhood , when he 'd roamed the countryside , looking for something he never found . He ignored the bruising memories and headed to the Elks Lodge . The parking lot was full , the fence posts dotted with red and gold balloons , the colors of Prospector High School , which served a community of several small towns . Sam pulled off the road and slowed to a stop , gravel crunching under his tires . The party was well under way . Laughter spilled from the open doorways and windows as Madonna sang the 1980s classic " Like a Virgin . " Nostalgia did n't overtake him - he 'd never understood the appeal of reunions - still , there was that one person he 'd come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-seven . He was sure she would be in the crowd . And he had something to say to her . To Dana Cleary . Dana Sterling , he amended . Her married name . Then he could close the book on his past forever . He had a choice in the timing . He could wait until the party ended and catch her at her parents ' house , where she would undoubtedly spend the night . Or he could get it over with now and be in San Francisco for his latest assignment before midnight , his past shoveled six feet under .... After a moment Sam turned off the ignition and got out of the car . He 'd been in some tight circumstances , life-and-death situations . He 'd welcomed the challenges , gloried in the risks , exulted in his escapes . He could channel the adrenaline flow in his body deliberately , but the anticipation of seeing Dana sent a rush through him that he could n't control . He wondered at the rare sensation , even savored it . He approached the building but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle . Lingering near an open door he noted more balloons , and a disco ball that dappled the room with speeding stars . Memories washed over him of his junior year and another dance . Watching through a window . Music and laughter , dinner and dancing . A longing so painful ... He 'd taken her to the senior prom the next year , but their relationship had n't changed for having gone to the dance . None of that mattered fifteen years later as Sam slipped into the Elks Lodge just as the deejay took a break from his chatter and the 1980s music . Candi James bounded onto the stage and scooped up the microphone , the same pep-squad perkiness she 'd had in high school still evident as she read from a long list , leading the cheers for such notable accomplishments as who had the most children , who 'd come the farthest and on and on and on . With everyone 's attention directed at Candi , Sam moved around the perimeter of the room . He stopped when he spotted Dana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , taking a moment to watch her instead . A little taller than average , she was more angular than curvy , her hair not strictly blond or brunette but a honeyed mix of both , and shoulder length now , not the rich waterfall to her waist that had made him want to wrap his hands in it and pull her close . He could n't see her eyes from where he stood , but he knew they were obsidian , pitch-dark eyes that had issued him challenges since elementary school . She wore an unrevealing , blue couture dress and low heels , understated , practical and elegant , befitting her position , but a far cry from the hot-pink number she 'd worn at the junior prom . " And finally , " Candi said , folding her list and setting it aside , " our three mega success stories . Harley Bonner , who owns the eighth largest ranching operation in the state of California . " Cheers went up . Sam 's blood froze . If he were a vengeful man - " Lilith Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the country . " More hoots and hollers . " And finally , Dana Cleary Sterling . Dana - you 've made us so proud . Here 's to six more years ! " So , Sam thought , the speculation was over . She 'd made a decision . " We 'll have music and dancing for two more hours , " Candi shouted over the din . " Do n't forget the picnic in the park tomorrow at noon . If you have n't had your picture taken for the memory book , you 've only got a half hour left . Remember to sign the update forms , too . Have fun ! " Sam watched as well-wishers surrounded Dana , who seemed surprisingly uneasy at the attention . A barrier went up , an invisible wall that kept people at a distance . She held her wineglass in both hands , a silent signal . No handshakes , please . No hugs . Only her friend Lilith got close enough to bump arms , and that lasted but a second . The change in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When had she lost the outward joy of life ? She 'd touched people . Him . The music started again , Sting singing " Every Breath You Take , " blasting Sam with fresh images of the junior prom where he 'd painfully watched Dana with her date , her smile bright . She had n't been a cheerleader , but almost everything else , including student-body president . She 'd seemed golden to him , the way she combined academics , sports and extracurricular activities . Sam shouldered his way past the memories and through the crowd . Conversation quieted enough for him to hear the reaction being voiced at his appearance . " Who - " " I think that 's Sam Remington - " " Really ? But he 's so - " " Gorgeous . Ca n't be Sam . He never dressed that good . " " He sure has filled out . " Sam never broke stride . When he did , the murmuring stopped . Surprised pleasure stole across Dana 's face , startling him . The anger he 'd harbored for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been good between them . He put his hand out to her , invading her invisible barrier . Then he waited . The next move was hers . ( Continues ... )
