<p> Until last summer , the 136-year-old building at 28 Monument Square had been one of the most visible eyesores at the center of this energetic Atlantic Coast city . You would never know it now . <p> Most days , a steady stream of customers follow their noses , thirst and appetites into the building , home of the new Public Market House , where in a narrow corridor flanked by vendors they can buy fresh-cut flowers , cheese from Maine farms , a sandwich on fresh-baked bread and beer from state microbreweries . <p> The seven-month-old market occupies the basement and first floor of the partly renovated four-story building at the heart of downtown , which was last home to a failing surplus store . <p> Kris Horton , whose K. Horton Specialty Foods has become a local landmark , led an active public campaign last year to establish the new market after the Libra Foundation , a philanthropic organization in Maine , sold the last of its real estate holdings in Portland , including the larger indoor Portland Public Market , two blocks away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that market since 1998 . <p> The new Public Market House , situated in a square that has supported a large outdoor seasonal farmers market for decades , has become the latest example of how fresh local food and downtown markets can stimulate activity in American cities , big and small . <p> Although the Public Market House is and will continue to be significantly smaller in size and sales than the old market it replaced , it will not be subsidized . Moreover , the Public Market House 's proximity to the existing outdoor Wednesday farmers ' market prompted the authors of a new economic study to propose promoting the indoor market as the centerpiece of a " market district . " <p> " Markets bring life to a city , " said Nelle Hanig , a business development specialist in Portland 's Economic Development Division , who helped accelerate the permit process to have the market built . " This one is already a destination . The location of the Public Market House is important to its success . It 's right in the middle of town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always good in a city . " <p> The study , completed last month for the Portland Downtown District , an economic development agency , said that the Public Market House is already attracting enough shoppers to generate $1.2 million annually in sales . The building 's owner is planning to renovate the second floor to provide space for four or five more vendors , who could generate a further $1.2 million in sales . <p> The market district , the study said , might also include a covered outdoor market with 25 vendors on nearby Lancaster Lane , as well as producers selling goods on " day tables " in Monument Square . <p> The old market 's sale last August and the steady departure of vendors until its formal closing in January stirred passions throughout the city . Downtown workers and weekend shoppers from the suburbs loved the old market 's homegrown vendors and special events . <p> But vendors paid less than $20 a square foot to rent space in a market that cost the foundation as much as $75 a square foot , said Morris Fischer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented Guggenheim Real Estate , the New York investment firm that bought the market last August . <p> " Libra could not get it to a break-even point , " Mr. Fischer said . " Libra supported it for a long time hoping they could make sense of it . They came to the conclusion they could n't do it any longer . Others who looked at it said the same thing . " <p> It seems , however , that the old market may be put to a new public use . On March 19 , the Portland City Council approved a measure to ask voters to allow the city to buy and convert the old market into the city 's public library , replacing the current main library building , which is next door . A referendum to approve a $1 million bond is set for June 12 . Most observers expect voters to approve the bond . <p> Voters previously approved a $4 million bond to improve library services , and if the June referendum passes that money would also be used to renovate the market . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be raised by the library . <p> Last summer , Ms. Horton and her partners in Market Vendors  --  A Country Bouquet , Maine Beer and Beverage and Big Sky Bread Company  --  worked with the owner of 28 Monument Square , as well as a contractor , a banker , tradesmen and city officials to quickly renovate the derelict building , which had been closed for two years . The project took six weeks and cost the building 's owner , H. Alan Mooney , $250,000 . The Public Market House opened as scheduled on Sept. 1 . <p> Mr. Mooney , a prominent engineer , had paid $725,000 to buy 28 Monument Square after learning that Ms. Horton and her partners , all of whom he knew , were intent on establishing a new market . " If I did n't have a tenant ready to get into the building immediately , I would n't have taken it on , " Mr. Mooney said . <p> He said that he is planning to spend $300,000 more this spring to renovate the market 's second floor to make room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional offices and restore the 12,000-square-foot building 's historic facade . <p> The catalyst in this tale of civic renewal was the announcement by the Libra Foundation in February 2006 that it would sell the last of its holdings in downtown Portland , including the Portland Public Market , which the foundation built and opened in 1998 . <p> The $9.4 million , L-shaped expanse of glass and soaring timber beams had a huge fireplace at its center , and a parking deck attached by an overhead walkway . The market took in $6 million in sales in its first year , and sustained that sales level throughout most of its short life . <p> The market was also a centerpiece of the Libra Foundation 's novel strategy of using its considerable assets  --  $220 million  --  to buy and renovate downtown office buildings to jump-start Portland 's reeling economy . Along with the Portland Public Market , the foundation  --  started here in 1989 by Elizabeth Noyce , the former wife of Robert N. Noyce , a founder of Intel  --  opened a downtown bank , bought and renovated seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the foundation started its acquisition program in the early 1990s , office vacancy rates hovered at more than 60 percent and Portland 's economy and reputation were stagnant . <p> Portland , a city of 64,000 , is now a place where housing values are stable , personal incomes are rising and historic neighborhoods overlooking Casco Bay and the Atlantic are so popular among young people , urban professionals and retirees from Boston and New York that the office and housing vacancy rates are under 3 percent . <p> Four years ago , according to Owen Wells , the foundation 's president , Libra changed course to take advantage of the economic conditions it had helped to foster . " We wanted to capitalize on strong real estate markets in Portland , " he said . <p> In 2002 and 2003 , Libra sold three buildings and a parking deck for $31 million . Three years later the foundation completed the sale of its other downtown real estate  --  four office buildings , two parking decks and the Portland Public Market  --  to Guggenheim Real Estate for more than $55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Three months after its formal closing , the old market 's windows are streaked and grimy . Two blocks away , though , on a bright winter afternoon , the new Public Market House swarms with customers . <p> " I believe in the spirit of a public market being a community , " said Ms. Horton , while attending to early afternoon customers . " We found out that a lot of other people in Portland feel the same way . " ##
