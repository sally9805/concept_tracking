The world 's most beautiful busy place has a side entrance where lines never form . Back there , you can hear yourself think Muirish thoughts about the otherworldly light and color this land seems to emit . Like that image better ? Make it real by hiking any of these off the beaten tracks . High Passes Loop 1 With Yosemite proper attracting so much attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by some of the most breathtaking mountain wilderness in the country . This 48-mile hike takes in a few of the highest trails in the park and the southwest corner of the Ansel Adams Wilderness . Lillian Lake sets the tone early , reflecting the rock-carpeted slopes of 10,552-foot Sing Peak in a scene worthy of America 's greatest landscape photographer . At Fernandez Pass-the first of four passes-you enter Yosemite amid hemlocks , and lodgepole and whitebark pine . Just before the pass , you 'll get an effort-rewarding view eastward of ragged Banner Peak , the Ritter Range , and central Sierra Nevada . It only gets better at 11,180-foot Red Peak Pass-the highest point on trail in the park-with views as far as Matterhorn Peak on Yosemite 's northern perimeter . Drop your pack for an easy off-trail scramble up nearby 11,699-foot Red Peak . Potential campsites abound , from Lower Ottoway Lake to a constellation of alpine lakes and tarns , some unnamed , speckling the Clark Range . Beyond 10,750-foot Post Peak Pass , you 'll wander through a landscape unique in all of Yosemite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , enjoy colors and quiet as you follow the wildflower-lined South Fork Merced River . Budget at least 5 days , with more time for side trips to lakes . Kerrick And Matterhorn Canyons 2 Nowhere in Yosemite 's north country does the scenery match the ragged grandeur of these canyons . The 13-mile-long Matterhorn takes first prize , with its rock-strewn meadows , toothy skyline , and smooth granite cliffs . Kerrick 's domes mirror another , more-famous , corner of the park , minus the traffic jams . This 54-mile loop begins at busy Mono Village , passing views of Victoria , Hunewell , and Kettle Peaks on the way to Barney and Peeler Lakes-both set in classic Yosemite basins below razor-edged peaks . In Kerrick Canyon , head .75 mile off the trail for your pick of splendid campsites around Arndt Lake . Just beyond Seavey Pass , at more than 9,000 feet on the Pacific Crest Trail , you 'll gaze through impossibly clear air at Benson Lake and numerous summits beyond . Instead of camping at popular Smedberg Lake , take a side trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the water to Regulation Peak . The climb to Benson Pass concludes with an airy alpine panorama , including Volunteer , Doghead , Quarry , and Virginia Peaks . Descending again , the hanging valley of Wilson Creek empties into Matterhorn Canyon ; hike north between walls rising as much as 3,000 feet . On a clear day from Burro Pass , just below 12,264-foot Matterhorn Peak and the broken smile of Sawtooth Ridge , Clouds Rest and Half Dome are visible to the south . Lake VernonTiltill Valley 3 If abundant wildlife and scenery of Yosemite Valley caliber do n't interest you , skip this hike . Otherwise , endure the hordes at the Hetch Hetchy trailhead , because you 'll drop them within the first few switchbacks above the reservoir , their cacophony disappearing in the roar of waterfalls upvalley . Watch for deer and , in early evening , black bears on the trail to Lake Vernon , a broad puddle spanning a canyon floor once buried under 1,600 feet of ice . Make your way across the polished granite slabs to a campsite on the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flumes and tributary creeks of the basin upstream from Vernon . Sitting by the lakeshore at dusk , you 'll be treated to the sight of hundreds of bats swooping through the air for their nightly mosquito dinner . From Lake Vernon , the trail climbs through about three dozen switchbacks , with the views of this corner of the park expanding until the trail enters a fir forest . Soon , you 'll begin a long descent through the Tiltill Valley nearly to the shores of Hetch Hetchy . Turning back toward the trailhead , you 'll hike below Wapama Falls , a two-drop , 1,400-foot cascade . This roughly 28-mile loop stays well below 8,000 feet , making it a good early-summer option .
