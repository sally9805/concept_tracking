Theodore Bilbo // I arrived in Washington in 1943 , when the city was fast becoming a crowded , bustling war capital  --  filled with clerks and businessmen and diplomats and exiled foreign leaders . But my life was pretty simple : riding the segregated trolleys downtown to work at the NBC offices in the old Trans-Lux building on Fourteenth Street ; living in rented rooms in private houses  --  the only housing available at any price  --  and having to deal with cranky landlords and landladies who constantly posted on the walls new rules of behavior and reminders of the need for neatness in the bathrooms . I had come to Washington from the South , and despite the new bustle , it had a very familiar feeling . It was sleepy , often slow-moving , inbred , and thoroughly segregated . // Local Washington , through presidents , wars , and depressions , had settled into an acceptance of George Washington ? s poor choice of location in a sprawling , slow-moving Southern city . People from real cities  --  New York , Chicago , Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it astonishing . There were few restaurants offering anything not fried in deep fat . On Connecticut Avenue there was a place called Old New Orleans featuring in its front display window a large , plump black woman wearing a long gingham dress and a red bandanna on her head and sitting in a rocking chair , rocking by the hour  --  the restaurant ? s trademark . Only a river ? s breadth away lay the old Confederacy . Robert E. Lee ? s house , Arlington , still stood on the opposite bank . The speaker of the House of Representatives , Sam Rayburn of Bonham , Texas , had not one but five pictures of Lee on his office wall , symmetrically arranged and all facing south . For whites as for blacks , Washington was southern . Capital of the United States , yes , but southern in manner , style , and appearance and southern in climate and culture . // I lived in Washington for fifty-five years after that , and saw it change a great deal before I left . But the image that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I visited first with my mother in the 1930s , when we stayed at the old Hotel Harrington downtown , and of the only slightly noisier town I found when I moved there in the early 1940s. // To me , as a sometime Capitol Hill reporter , the antiquated character of the city was most visible in Congress , which was still carrying on in the manner of a fading aristocracy , in a setting of marble stairways , horsehair sofas , polished brass spittoons , snuffboxes on the senators desks , potted palms , Oriental rugs , leather chairs , and Havana cigars . There were even a few members still affecting frock coats , wing collars , and black string ties . Through the 1930s , it was a gentlemen ? s club with but one woman senator  --  Hattie Caraway of Arkansas , who sat in the chamber every day knitting , listening , and saying nothing . // " People don ? t give a damn what the average Senator or Congressman says , " the columnist Raymond Clapper wrote . " The reason they don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress is 99 per cent tripe , ignorance and demagoguery and not to be relied on . " Clapper ? s description applied to many politicians on Capitol Hill , but it fit no one better than a man from Mississippi , one of the most extraordinary and preposterous figures I ever encountered in my many years as a Washington reporter . // United States Senator Theodore Gilmore Bilbo ( known at home as " The Man " ) was somewhere between five feet and five feet six inches tall . He was a vain man , often described as a " strutting peacock , " and he refused to reveal his exact height . But one Mississippian who helped vote him into the Senate said , " When Theo Bilbo is on the stump , he ? s seven feet ten inches tall , " which gives some idea of Bilbo ? s talent as an orator , a talent he used freely in getting himself elected state senator , lieutenant governor , governor , and finally U.S. senator for two terms . Bilbo led a charmed political life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and climbing higher and higher all the time . In the 1940s , when he sat in the Senate during the greatest war in history , even colleagues who had been sharing the chamber with him for over a decade sometimes found it hard to believe that someone like him could really be there . // Bilbo , the youngest of ten children , was born in 1877 on a farm in the wire-grass country of Mississippi , six miles from the railroad station at Poplarville . It was an area of the state with little cotton and not many blacks ; an area where slavery had not much taken root and where loyalty to the Confederacy had been relatively weak . People from around Poplarville had a lively resentment of the planter aristocracy and a belief that ordinary people were getting a raw deal from the government and the corporations . Like many poor whites , they also had a real contempt for black people  --  mostly because they needed someone they could feel superior to . // In Bilbo ? s family , as in most others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school only by paying his own expenses . Between terms at Peabody College and Vanderbilt University , where he won a law degree , he sandwiched work as a " news butcher " on southern trains . While selling bananas and newspapers up and down lurching train aisles , he learned phrenology , a system by which some people thought they could determine character from head shapes . " During those days , " he said , " I earned as much as $250 a month . " He claimed he could look at a passenger ? s head and determine the quickest and best way to separate him from his money . // After college , Bilbo became a traveling Sunday school organizer and won a preacher ? s license as a reward for secretarial services at Baptist institutions . Those who heard him said he could preach a thumping sermon on the regular minister ? s day off . Those who heard his speeches in later years didn ? t doubt it . // He first ran for office , county court clerk , at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back again , seeking a $250-a-year job as state senator . He tore into that campaign furiously , rode his father ? s horse two thousand miles , and took his message to the people . They liked it and elected him by a big majority . // The story of Bilbo and that first term in the legislature became famous in Mississippi , and there have been almost as many versions as tellers . It involves a well-documented charge of bribery , impeachment proceedings , and a resolution calling him " unfit to sit with honest , upright men in a respectable legislative body . " He was saved from impeachment by one vote and forever after blamed the impeachment attempt on the fat cats trying to get rid of him before he got rid of them . // Bilbo took the stump again four years later and won election as lieutenant governor . His first official act was to remove the " unfit " resolution from the records . The next four years were uneventful , except for another bribery charge and another acquittal . Bilbo then told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in 1915 , burnishing the already growing legend of his political indestructibility . A defeated opponent once said , " The lower you push Theo Bilbo , the higher he bounces back . " // As governor , in one uproarious day , Bilbo fired the presidents of the University of Mississippi , the State College for Women , and the A and M College . On the same day he fired 179 professors and teachers . For chancellor of the university system he named a real-estate salesman who held no degree . The Mississippi Power and Light Company ? s advertising manager was made president of A and M. For a University Administration Board , he chose two dentists , one bank cashier , one doctor , and three lawyers . When Bilbo was criticized for tampering with the schools , his only answer was " Things have come to a hell of a pass when a man can ? t wallop his own jackass. " // Bilbo was not a particularly handsome man . But he didn ? t seem to know it , and neither , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear him . He had a flair for showmanship , particularly in his wardrobe . He stocked up on pinkish shirts , flaming red neckties , red suspenders , and red handkerchiefs . ( At night he wore red pajamas . ) The final bit of dash was the diamond horseshoe stickpin , which he ? d bought in 1916 at an auction for $92.50 , and which he considered a good luck charm . He didn ? t have much hair , but what he had was slicked back , well oiled , and plastered down . It was his magnetism , not his looks , that presumably endeared him to his supporters ( and also to the many women he liked to " visit " with as he traveled around the state ) . Some thought Bilbo ? s dandyism might get him into trouble with the state ? s poor white farmers , but it never seemed to hurt him . He even survived a charge by an opponent that he had been seen in public taking dancing lessons and eating caviar. // He was in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep South politicians became progressives . Like his racist mentor James Vardaman , Bilbo combined his love of the white man ( and hatred of the black ) with efforts to help poor whites and stir up their resentment of rich people and corporations , the kind of resentment that had been a staple of political life in his home town . He fiddled with the tax codes to make corporations and utilities pay more and ordinary people pay less . He increased state aid to public schools . In later years , he called his program " books and bricks . " Some people in the 1930s liked to compare him to Huey Long , and like Long he lashed out at " Wall Streeters " and rich corporations and the political old guard . Once he even told an audience that he thought " every man should be a king and every woman a queen , " using Long ? s trademark phrases . But Bilbo was not nearly as skillful or smart as Long , and he was always getting into trouble . If it wasn ? t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he stubbornly refused to change even though it was clear it would fail or hurt him politically , or both . // One of them involved the South African tick , a tiny insect he said was spreading Texas fever , a disease deadly to cattle . As governor , he pushed legislation requiring farmers to dip their cattle into chemical vats to kill any ticks they might be carrying . Farmers didn ? t like the idea . They feared the dip would kill their cattle along with the ticks . But Bilbo persisted , even after someone sneaked into the state ? s dipping yards and dynamited the vats. // By law , Bilbo couldn ? t run for re-election . Lee M. Russell , who succeeded him , hadn ? t been in the State House long when he became involved in a lawsuit . The complainant summoned Bilbo as the main witness , but Bilbo avoided testifying against his friend Russell by hiding in a barn . The case was dismissed for lack of evidence . But Judge Edwin R. Holmes gave Bilbo thirty days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even those days weren ? t wasted . His cell faced a street , and by shouting through the barred window he gathered a crowd outside . He told them about the injustice of his case and announced he would seek a second term as governor at the next election . He did , but the farmers remembered those livestock dipping vats and were still resentful . So he lost . // In 1927 his luck was better and he was elected governor again . This term was an unhappy one both for Bilbo and the people of Mississippi . His enemies controlled the legislature . He refused to sign its tax bills , and it refused to pass his . When his term ended , the state ? s treasury balance stood at $1,326.17 , and appropriated obligations were $7,486,760.20 . The state of Mississippi was broke . So was Bilbo  --  out of a job and out of money . // He began looking at the U.S. Senate . Senator Hubert D. Stephens , then representing Mississippi , fell ill during Bilbo ? s second term as governor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting like a ghoul for me to die " so he could appoint a successor . // " Senator Stephens , " Bilbo retorted , " is a vicious , malicious , pusillanimous , cold-blooded , premeditated , plain , ordinary liar . " Later he added , " I was really very considerate of him . He was a sick man . " But he didn ? t die in time for Bilbo to replace him . Bilbo was never a man to forget a grudge. // When he left the governorship , Bilbo campaigned for U.S. Senator Pat Harrison , then up for re-election in Mississippi . Harrison won and rewarded Bilbo with a $6,000-a-year Department of Agriculture job as a " consultant on public relations . " What Bilbo really did was supervise a corps of women who clipped mentions of the New Deal ? s Agricultural Assistance Administration from newspapers and magazines . He denied that he ever dipped a brush into a paste pot , and he resented the name applied to him both in Mississippi and Washington : " the Pastemaster General . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and managed to see that his name appeared in its clippings occasionally , and that it was always properly spelled . // But Bilbo was not cut out to be an agency bureaucrat , and in 1934 he appeared suddenly in Senator Harrison ? s office and announced that he planned to oppose Stephens in the next race . Harrison told him to go ahead , but added , " I ? ll have to support Stephens . " // " By all means do so , " Bilbo said . " That ? ll give me my best campaign argument . " // " What ? s that ? " // " I ? m going to say you now have two Senate seats in your pocket , but the Constitution calls for two men and I ? m running for the vacancy . " // Bilbo ran , and he put on the loudest , gaudiest campaign Mississippi had ever seen . He toured the state from end to end in his flivver . He threw barbecue parties for more than 18,000 persons . He sang " Bringing In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " Clementine , " accompanying himself on the melodeon . He promised voters everything he could think of . He blasted such fanciful enemies as " farmer murderers , corrupters of Southern womanhood , and skunks who steal Gideon Bibles from hotel rooms . " He said the state was ridden with Communism and needed him to cleanse it . ( Forty-seven Communist votes were cast in the state that year . ) He reminded the voters that Bilbo is a two-edged sword . " That ? s me , " he said . " I fight coming and going . " Most Mississippi newspapers hated Bilbo and tried to stop him , but he enjoyed their dislike of him and just campaigned harder . He once admitted that he liked campaigning better than holding office . &lt; //
