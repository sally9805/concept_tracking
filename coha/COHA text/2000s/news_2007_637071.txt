<p> Does God still send messages through the weather ? <p> " God speaks to us in many ways , but I have never looked to the weather or natural disasters for God 's voice . When someone assigns a specific divine meaning to natural disasters he or she is claiming divine authority for human words . With such words we learn more about human nature than the nature of God . Historically , people have misused religious belief to speak words of judgment against people suffering from illness or disaster . Sometimes the words are cruel . Other times the words come from people who like the friends of Job are well-meaning but misguided . In either case , we do well to remember our place in the created order and to know that there are many things that happen in this world that we do not understand . ... God 's primary revelation to us is in Jesus Christ who is made known to us today through the Scriptures . We will find God 's voice in the Scriptures . " <p>  --  The Rev. Glenn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe God will utilize anything to get his point(s) across . He can show his faithfulness to a farmer by sending the rain . He can also reveal his justice by ordaining a flood . There is nothing outside of his sovereign control , therefore , we should clearly see that all forms of weather are under his authority and he can use them for whatever he chooses . The problem may arise when someone chooses to declare that a particular weather system is sent by God for a particular purpose . Typically this occurs when some overzealous believer will overstep his or her bounds and declare that God is punishing someone by sending destructive weather their way . I would tremble at making such a statement because it may or may not be true . To declare that one knows why God sent a particular form of weather is to imply that one has received special revelation from God , a practice which is thoroughly unbiblical . ... The best way to know what God wants to communicate is to avoid looking at the weather and keep looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meadow Baptist Church pastor <p> " The fact that God does communicate with man is amazing . How he communicates is wonderful . God used the rainbow to remind people that he would never destroy the earth with water again . God used drought during Elijah 's time to punish wicked King Ahab . A storm at night on the Sea of Galilee reminded the fearful disciples of their absolute dependence on their savior . Paul reminds us in Romans that all men can discern God 's power and deity through the works of nature . God has often painted his pictures on the pallet of the sky using the brush of the storm . " <p>  --  The Rev. Dan Sweatt , Berean Baptist Church senior pastor <p> " In the act of creating the universe , God created man as his partner . In Genesis 2:15 , we read : ' God placed man in the garden of Eden , to farm and care for it . ' From that time on , men and women became responsible for the world we live in . We should continually reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to properly care for and protect the Earth . Global warming and the effects of air pollution are measurements on the report card on how we are doing . " <p>  --  Rabbi Ronald Bluming , Temple Beth David <p> " I always look directly to the Bible for inspiration . God 's messages are very clear in the Bible . Usually , events around us including the weather can leave the impression that we are at the whim of a wrathful God or even worse maybe outside of his power and love all together . But messages like these from the Bible : ' He saw everything that he made and behold it was very good , ' and ' Lo , I am with you always , ' flip that view . Understanding that God is good , is love , and loves you and me , his creation is the central theme of the Bible and solid foundation for putting the world and every experience in the proper perspective . " <p>  --  Spring Griffith , First Church of Christ , Scientist , Lilburn , Committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discern signs and portents from the local weather report . But global weather trends should definitely be a wake-up call to people of faith . We humans , especially we first-world humans , have abused the planet and its atmosphere to the point that the very system that keeps us alive is degrading . God may very well be hoping we get the message , and soon . The Earth and everything in it is meant to praise the God who made it , but instead creation groans under the weight of our hard use . Global warming ( and local effects like our weirdly chilly spring ) is a spiritual issue as well as a scientific reality , an economic conundrum , and a political problem . " <p>  --  The Rev. Katie Hays , First Christian Church of Lawrenceville pastor <p> " God does indeed send messages through the weather and by many other means . Floods , forest fires , hurricanes , tornadoes , earthquakes and storms are all a part of this great world we live in . Nature is governed by laws and principles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , and that is God is in control and can certainly control the weather . When I hear people talk about a hurricane , tornados , floods or natural disasters and say , ' It was an act of God , ' it does not set well with me . God is not sending storms and disasters to correct or chastise mankind . This is simply nature taking its course . When it rains , it rains on the godly and the ungodly . It is the law of nature . When storms hit , it affects the righteous as well as the unrighteous . Our role is to trust God and to allow him to work the good and the bad together for our good and for our benefit . We do n't always understand why the disaster , why the storms , but we must know that God is sovereign and that his will , will be done . " <p>  --  Bishop W. Wayne Pugh , Church Alive of Atlanta senior pastor <p> " I have a hard time believing that our loving God commands the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean to rise and drown people or the Earth to shake so that houses collapse with families still inside as we have seen in recent natural disasters . However , in the voices of the victims of such atrocities God does speak . We heard God 's call to help the afflicted through the crowds of victims outside the Superdome in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . We heard God in the voices of desperate mothers , in the silence of the dead , all who ask , ' Why , in this modern world where the wealthy can even fly to the moon , are the poor not treated with justice ? ' Therefore , I believe that God does send messages through the weather , but recently these messages have been messages of condemnation on a country that has the resources to serve the poor , the displaced , and the hungry , but in the midst of disaster failed her people . We must all hear these voices that reveal injustice and work toward a society where all God 's children are safe and valued equally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presbyterian Church associate pastor <p> " Certainly . Earthquakes , droughts , floods , famines and fires are all reminders of sin . ... Some would have us believe that these events are new or more common in our current age , but they have been going on since the fall into sin . The first book of the Bible records all kinds of weather-related disasters : floods , earthquakes , famines and even raining fire from heaven . In many of these Old Testament examples God sent prophets to relate what the weather-related event meant : Noah 's flood , the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah , the earthquake which crushed Korah 's rebellion against Moses , and the famine during Elijah 's ministry are all good examples of how God used weather for a very specific judgment . But in the New Testament age , God does not provide us with the specific whys through his prophets . Today these events are simply a general reminder of sin , in the world and in us . But know that God is still in control and uses these things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathanael Mayhew , Zion Lutheran Church pastor <p> " God sends messages in every way he chooses . We can not put him in a box that says : This is the only way God speaks to us . The problem is people do not always understand or perceive the truth that God is revealing to us . But if we really want to know specifically what God is saying , do n't decide a sunny day means one thing and a storm another , study the Scriptures , the very word of God to you and me . " <p>  --  The Rev. Earl A. Bland , Lawrenceville Presbyterian Church pastor <p> " When we ask a question like this , what we really may want to know is , ' If God is good , then why do bad things  --  including devastating natural disasters  --  happen ? ' This question has challenged people of faith for countless centuries . But it is too simplistic and a distortion of the Bible to draw from it a picture of an angry , vengeful God , who stands by just waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single verse or story in the Bible can not give us an adequate understanding of God . The overarching theme of the Bible , including both the Old and the New Testaments , is that God is loving , gracious and relentlessly faithful . We also may long to know whether and how God is with us . We want to know that we are not alone , particularly in times and places where we have suffered . One of the healing lessons of the cross is that God in Jesus Christ not only died for us , but suffers with us . " <p>  --  The Rev.
