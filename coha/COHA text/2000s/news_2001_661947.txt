Other double winners were the Chicago Tribune , The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal . <p> In breaking news reporting , The Miami Herald won for its coverage of the pre-dawn raid by federal agents who took custody of Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez . The story also produced the breaking news photography award for Alan Diaz of The Associated Press , for his photo of a federal agent in riot gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's awesome ! I ca n't believe it ! " Diaz said as he was mobbed by Miami AP staff members and toasted with champagne . <p> The AP was a finalist in public service for coverage of the 2000 presidential election , singled out for praise by the Pulitzer board " particularly during those 36 uncertain days when much of the nation looked to the AP for disciplined , 24-hour reporting on the close votes and recounts . " The other finalist was The Washington Post for its series on AIDS in Africa . <p> David Moats of the Rutland ( Vt . ) Herald - circulation 22,000 - won the newspaper 's first Pulitzer , for editorials in support of civil unions for gay couples . <p> " I 'm flying high ! " Moats said , as champagne was passed around the newsroom . <p> David Willman of the Los Angeles Times won for investigative reporting for his expose of unsafe drugs that had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration . <p> For explanatory reporting , the staff of the Chicago Tribune won for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . <p> The beat reporting Pulitzer went to David Cay Johnston of The New York Times for exposing loopholes and inequities in the U.S. tax code . The Times also won for national reporting for its series on race in America . <p> Two prizes were awarded in international reporting . Ian Johnson of The Wall Street Journal won for stories about the Chinese government 's suppression of the Falun Gong movement . Paul Salopek of the Chicago Tribune - a winner in 1998 for explanatory reporting for a profile of the human genome project - won for reporting on political strife and disease in Africa . <p> It 's rare that the Pulitzer committee awards two prizes in one category . The last time it happened in international reporting was in 1993 for stories about the Bosnian conflict . <p> The feature writing prize went to Tom Hallman Jr . of Portland 's Oregonian for a profile of a facially disfigured teen-ager who underwent surgery . <p> The Oregonian 's INS series found that the agency was detaining people for long periods without giving them access to legal representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It took a lot of courage to tell their stories to us . Many had already been through the mill with the INS , " said Rich Read , one of four reporters who worked on the stories . <p> The commentary award went to Dorothy Rabinowitz of The Wall Street Journal for articles on American society and culture . <p> Pulitzer Prize administrator Seymour Topping said Rabinowitz was not one of the three finalists selected by the Pulitzer jury . He said the Pulitzer board , which makes the final decisions , sought " a broader choice " and that the jury offered Rabinowitz as an alternate selection . " It is a rare occurrence , " Topping said . <p> Gail Caldwell of The Boston Globe won for criticism for her observations on contemporary life and literature . <p> The editorial cartooning prize went to Ann Telnaes of the Los Angeles Times Syndicate . <p> The Pulitzer for feature photography went to Matt Rainey of The Star-Ledger of Newark , N.J. , for his emotional photographs of the care and recovery of two students burned in a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the students " two really special souls . " <p> " I think they 're heroes , " he said . <p> It was the Star-Ledger 's first Pulitzer . The newspaper 's spot news coverage of the fire also was a finalist , and the paper 's Robin Gaby Fisher was a finalist in the feature writing category for stories on the students ' recovery . <p> The AP was a finalist in feature photography for David Guttenfelder 's photos of North and South Koreans visiting relatives they had not seen in half a century . The category 's other finalist was Marc Piscotty of the Rocky Mountain News of Denver for photos of suburban high school students facing adulthood . <p> Each winner receives $ 7,500 , except for the public service award , where the winning newspaper receives a gold medal . <p> On the Net : <p> Pulitzer Prizes : http : //www.pulitzer.org <p> &gt;+++++ <p> Newspapers weigh new study on readership <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - At long last , the newspaper industry has received something it was hoping to get for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening problem , a long-term decline in newspaper readership . <p> As the saying goes , be careful what you wish for . <p> The initial reception to the study , first presented at the recent meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington , was gratifying . All 500 copies disappeared from a table outside the presentation in just 20 minutes , according to the study 's author . <p> " The response was beyond anything I 've seen in the industry or in the academy , " said John Lavine , a professor of both journalism and business at Northwestern University who headed up the study . " It could n't be more exciting . " <p> On the other hand , the survey also prescribes some tough medicine for newspaper editors and publishers , who have been fighting a losing battle for about three decades to retain readers . A proliferation of other media forms and busier schedules have been the most frequently blamed culprits for the decline . <p> Nonetheless , industry executives are poring over recommendations in the study , which many see as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts have focused on certain geographic areas and types of stories that attract readers most , but Lavine 's study covers 100 major markets throughout the nation at nearly every size of daily newspaper . <p> The new study also looks beyond news coverage to see how advertising styles , customer service , a newspaper 's brand and even the corporate culture of a newspaper company affect how much , how often and which parts of a newspaper people read . <p> Several of the survey 's proposals for improving readership can be implemented with relative ease , such as increasing the amount and types of local news coverage , adding more feature stories on lifestyle and science , and making the newspaper easier to navigate . <p> But other recommendations call for fundamental changes in the newspapering business , including an overhaul of corporate culture . The researchers found , for example , that more than 80 percent of the newspapers surveyed had " defensive " cultures that were " resistant to change , " whereas papers with more " adaptive " cultures tended to have better readership . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lavine said . " Will it be hard to get there ? You bet . " <p> The study recommends several broad proposals for improving readership : improving customer service , making editorial adjustments including more local news and lifestyle features , making papers easier to navigate , attracting more appealing advertising , building up the newspaper 's brand image , doing more to promote stories within the paper and making corporate culture more " adaptive " and " constructive . " <p> The review was undertaken over an 18-month period and examined , for the first time in one undertaking , every part of the newspapering business and how it affected readership , down to the physical condition of the newspaper when it arrives on doorsteps . <p> Newspaper circulation has also been ebbing in recent years , but the study , which was done at a specially created Readership Institute at Northwestern University 's Media Management Center , was focused instead on how , how much and how often people actually read newspapers as opposed to how many roll off the presses . <p> " I 'm very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive editor of The ( Portland ) Oregonian . " It 's the kind of thing you can bring in your newsroom and use for a base of discussion and analysis . The applications might vary from place to place , but as an overall tool , it strikes me as something very powerful . " <p> Many newspapers have already been making adjustments to improve readership , but the study provided specific data on what kinds of changes were most likely to result in more people spending more time with the paper . <p> For example , the researchers found that , contrary to conventional wisdom , readership could be greatly improved by fewer stories about natural disasters , more complex stories on science and more stories on food and fashion . <p> Orage Quarles III , publisher of The News &; Observer of Raleigh , N.C. , said his paper has been undergoing a redesign for the past 18 months to cater more closely to readers ' needs , including increasing arts coverage and regional news . But he said the study would provide a road map for future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the types and styles of advertising content could lead readers to spend more time with the paper . For example , people were more likely to read the paper if ads for food , clothing and health products were featured . <p> Tim McGuire , editor of the Star Tribune in Minneapolis and the president of ASNE , which participated in the study , said it was a little early to gauge how the recommendations would be borne out in the industry . <p> " I think that 's the one that 's going to take the longest to work on - getting a collaborative culture , " McGuire said . " I think there will be more movement on the other topics such as making the newspapers easier to read and redefining local news . " <p> The next measure of the survey 's effect will come when additional data is presented to publishers at the annual convention of the Newspaper Association of America in late April in Toronto . The NAA also participated in the survey , but the research was conducted at " arm 's length " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute has funding through the rest of the year , and Lavine said he hoped the group would continue follow-up research over the next few years . But the decision to continue that work would have to be made by the industry associations some time this year . <p> The researchers selected 100 newspapers throughout the nation to get a broad mix of papers based on circulation , market size , urban and rural markets , different levels of competition , and other factors . Extensive 12-page questionnaires were sent to 100,000 people , and 37,000 people responded . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> New York Times to trim staff through buyouts , layoffs <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - The New York Times Co. , blaming a slowdown in advertising and the uncertain economy , announced April 12 that it would make an unspecified number of staff cuts through buyouts and layoffs . <p> The news came the same day Dow Jones &; Co. , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , announced layoffs of 202 people , or 2 percent of its staff . Dow Jones also eliminated 300 open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details on the scope of the job reductions other than to say they would occur across all divisions . <p> Catherine Mathis , a company spokeswoman , said that the company 's online unit , which laid off 17 percent of its staff in January , would be affected . She declined to provide other details on the job cuts , saying the staff members affected had not yet been notified . <p> The company publishes The New York Times , The Boston Globe and several smaller newspapers . It also owns radio and television stations , online properties and news syndicates . <p> Russell T. Lewis , CEO of The New York Times , said in a statement that the buyouts would take two or three months to complete , and layoffs would come " in certain areas where the size of a business unit or other factors make the buyout program impractical . " <p> The cuts come at the beginning of the reporting season for first-quarter earnings . Many believe the quarter will be the most challenging the newspaper industry has faced in at least a decade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photos <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - The New York Times has settled a lawsuit with the NBA over the commercial rights to game photographs by agreeing to provide a direct Web link from the newspaper 's online store to NBA.com . <p> The NBA sued the newspaper in July after the Times began selling a collection of photographs from a playoff series between the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers . The NBA claimed the sale violated conditions the news media agree to when applying for credentials to shoot pictures of NBA games . <p> As part of a marketing agreement reached April 9 as part of the settlement , the Times will also feature the NBA.com logo on NYTimes.com and in print advertisements promoting the sale of Times photographs of NBA games . The Times will be allowed to continue to sell photographs of NBA games at its online store . <p> " We look forward to working with the NBA in this context to the benefit of our readers and basketball fans around the country , " said Arthur Sulzberger , Jr. , chairman of The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In its original lawsuit , the NBA asked the court to declare that the newspaper had breached its contract with the league , order the Times to stop selling the photos , and award the NBA unspecified damages , including all profits from the sale of the photos to the public . <p> &gt;+++++ Judge wo n't dismiss Hearst Corp . from Chronicle purchase suit <p> SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) - A federal judge refused to dismiss the Hearst Corp . from a federal antitrust suit stemming from its purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle last year . <p> The April 13 decision means a small , independent printer can attack Hearst 's $ 66 million subsidy to a local political family that took over Hearst 's San Francisco Examiner in November . Hearst , which purchased the San Francisco Chronicle for $ 660 million after giving away the Examiner , offered the subsidy and paper to the Fang family to assure federal antitrust regulators that San Francisco would remain a two-paper town . <p> After the deal closed , Fricke-Parks Press Co. of Union City sued the Grant Printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his family , claiming the Fangs were trying to drive competitors out of the printing business and were using the Hearst subsidy to do so . <p> Fricke-Parks also alleges a conspiracy between Hearst and Fang , a staunch political crony of San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown . The printer alleges that the two conspired to enable Fang to create a printing monopoly in return for Fang 's behind-the-scenes political aid in getting Hearst 's acquisition of the Chronicle past political and regulatory hurdles - including the mayor . <p> Those allegations are an outgrowth of testimony in a federal antitrust trial last year in which San Francisco real estate millionaire Clint Reilly failed but tried to block the deal . <p> The trial opened with testimony from Examiner publisher Tim White about " horse trading " with Mayor Brown . White said he 'd offered Brown favorable treatment in editorials if the mayor would support Hearst 's plans to buy the Chronicle and sell or close the Examiner . <p> U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker , while approving the Hearst-Chronicle deal in July , said at the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably anticompetitive " and suggested it might be challenged by competitors who lacked subsidies . <p> The Fangs , who publish the San Francisco Independent and other publications , have denied misusing the subsidy , which is to be paid over three years . The Fangs have argued that the contract with Hearst earmarks the money solely for publication of the new Fang-owned Examiner , which began publishing under the family 's control on Nov. 22 , and subjects spending to the scrutiny of an outside auditor . <p> Hearst , based in New York , has denied it was involved in a conspiracy . <p> No trial date has been set . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> Cincinnati , Kentucky Post to reduce staff <p> CINCINNATI ( AP ) - Declining advertising revenue is forcing The Cincinnati Post and The Kentucky Post to eliminate 20 editorial department positions , owner E.W. Scripps Co. said . <p> Staff will be reduced through normal attrition and by offering buyout packages to employees who volunteer to leave , said Tim Stautberg , Scripps ' vice president for communications and investor relations . <p> Employees will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of reducing expenses at the newspapers , he said April 10 . The newspapers have 112 full- and part-time employees . <p> All employees who have worked for the two newspapers for 10 or more years are eligible for the buyout , which includes pay based on length of service and company-paid health insurance coverage for a limited period of time , Stautberg said . <p> He said no specifics of the plan would be released until it was formally offered to employees . <p> The Post newspapers are published through a joint operating agreement with The Cincinnati Enquirer that expires in 2007 . <p> The Post has a circulation of more than 59,000 and is published Monday through Friday afternoons and Saturday morning . <p> &gt;+++++ Former publisher pleads guilty to violating state campaign finance law <p> PETOSKEY , Mich . ( AP ) - The former publisher of the Cheboygan Daily Tribune pleaded guilty April 10 to violating the Michigan Campaign Finance Act . <p> Roy S. Trahan II was charged in February with violating state campaign finance law by giving a mayoral candidate special rates on advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine . Trahan 's sentencing is scheduled for May 7 . <p> The Michigan Attorney General 's office wo n't make a recommendation on the terms of the sentence , a spokesman said . <p> Under an agreement with the attorney general 's office , Trahan agreed to plead guilty to one count in exchange for the dismissal of three additional counts of the same charge . <p> Trahan 's attorney , Mike Hackett , declined to comment on the case . <p> Trahan charged mayoral candidate Thomas J. VerWys $ 1 each for four campaign ads that ran in the Tribune in March 2000 , without granting similar discounts to VerWys ' opponent , Mayor Bill Chlopan . <p> Michigan law requires that any bargain rates be offered to all candidates . <p> Chlopan , who won the election , was charged the standard rate of $ 5.20 per column inch for advertising during the campaign . <p> Chris De Witt , spokesman for the attorney general 's office , has said he knew of no previous cases of newspaper officials being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know what he was being charged for ads in comparison with Chlopan . <p> Adrienne Janney , the Tribune 's former editor , said she tipped off police about the cut-rate ads . She was fired after the election . She later sued the newspaper , claiming her dismissal violated the state whistleblower law , which prohibits employers from firing workers who report suspected legal violations in the workplace . <p> The suit was settled out of court ; no terms were disclosed . <p> Trahan resigned as Tribune publisher May 9 , 2000 , after being placed on leave April 7 by Liberty Group Publishing , which owns the Tribune . He now works as a publisher at The News-Gazette in Winchester , Ind. , and sister paper News-Times of Hartford City , Ind . <p> &gt;+++++ ' B.C. ' cartoon with menorah and Christ 's words causes flap <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - A " B.C. " cartoon that featured a menorah and Jesus Christ 's words and was intended for use in April 15 newspapers prompted anger from some Jewish groups , with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden insertion of religiously offensive cartoons into the comics section of Sunday newspapers is highly inappropriate , " the American Jewish Committee said April 12 in a statement . <p> The group urged newspapers to either replace the cartoon or run a disclaimer . <p> In Maine , weekend editions of the Bangor Daily News went on sale without the color comics after Publisher Richard J. Warren decided the cartoon was potentially offensive . <p> " I apologize for the lack of color comics this weekend but offending any religion is always wrong and becomes especially poignant on this particular holiday when all religions are celebrating in their own traditional ways , " Warren wrote in a front-page letter to readers . <p> In Davenport , Iowa , the Quad-City Times decided to run the comic strip despite complaints from local Jewish and Christian religious leaders . <p> Editor John M. Humenik said he found the cartoon strip to be " needlessly insensitive " but said the newspaper would not censor it . <p> Award-winning cartoonist Johnny Hart , the creator of " B.C. " , defended the strip . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,300 newspapers worldwide . <p> " I regret if some people misunderstood the strip , and it hurt their feelings , " Hart said April 12 in a statement . " This is a holy week for both Christians and Jews , and my intent , as always , was to pay tribute to them . " <p> Hart added that he was frustrated by the negative reactions to his cartoon any time he includes mention of Jesus Christ . <p> " Whenever I try to honor this man of men ... hackles go up , " Hart said . " The God of Judaism and the God of Christianity is the same , and the people of Israel are his chosen people , and Jesus is one of them . " <p> Sunday is both Easter and the final day of Passover . <p> Jewish groups in Phoenix and Los Angeles also issued statements condemning the cartoon . <p> In the cartoon , the candles in a menorah burn out . The accompanying text quotes some of Jesus Christ 's dying words . In the final panels , the menorah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind an open tomb symbolizing Christ 's resurrection . <p> The AJC statement charged those panels represent " the belief that Christianity can and will replace Judaism . " <p> But the head of Creators Syndicate , which distributes Hart 's work , called that " ridiculous . " <p> " Far from being anti-Jewish , the strip is simply a celebration of Passover , which starts the week before , and Easter , which begins the day the strip is run , " syndicate President Richard Newcombe said . <p> Creators Syndicate would not say Thursday if any papers had opted not to run the Sunday cartoon . <p> Hart and " B.C. " previously have been honored for the best humor strip in America . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> MEDIA-CRIME COVERAGE : <p> Study recommends change in media crime coverage <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) - Network television coverage of crime fell nearly 40 percent last year , but the subject still gets too much media attention , a study asserted . <p> Researchers said crime was the biggest story of the 1990s , even during a time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " paid careful attention to the who , what , when and where of crime-scene coverage , but little to the important context of why that can help viewers and policy-makers make sense of crime and develop thoughtful solutions , " said Vincent Schiraldi , president of the Justice Policy Institute , one of three groups involved in the study released April 10 . <p> The study was paid for in part by a grant from the Justice Department and financial support from private foundations . <p> Schiraldi recommended that news organizations more closely monitor their content and put crime into context by reporting on more wide-ranging crime trends , even as part of stories about individual crimes . <p> The report , " Off Balance : Youth , Race and Crime in the News , " included an examination of 77 media-related studies done from 1910 until now . <p> Homicide coverage on network news increased 473 percent from 1990 to 1998 , while homicides decreased about 33 percent during that time , the report said . It based that finding on data from the Center for Media and Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the center catalogued 135,449 stories on ABC , CBS and NBC evening newscasts , and crime was the biggest topic , with 14,289 stories , the report said . <p> Crime coverage declined 39 percent in 2000 but remained the third most frequent topic on network news , it said . Crime was the top subject on local television news , several studies reviewed by researchers showed , including one in 1997 that found the subject consumed a third of the time devoted to local news . <p> The report also said minorities too often are portrayed as perpetrators and are underrepresented as victims . <p> A study of an Indianapolis newspaper , for instance , found that if a murder suspect was black , the average article length was longer . <p> " We cover crime as fairly as possible , both victims and suspects . As far as race in the crime itself , we try to be colorblind , " said Terry Eberle , editor of The Indianapolis Star . Neither Eberle nor his managing editor were at the newspaper in 1995 when data for the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime in newspapers and on television may have prompted 47 states to pass tougher juvenile crime laws . <p> The study , commissioned by a youth advocacy group , Building Blocks for Youth , was carried out by the liberal-oriented Berkeley Media Studies Group and Schiraldi 's Justice Policy Institute , which supports alternatives to prison . <p> Media groups , responding to the assertions , said their news coverage was based on public interest in crime . <p> " Just as in all private companies , there are some incidents of racism , but the focus on youth crime is due in part to the school-shooting phenomenon , " said Michael Hamilton , director of the California Broadcasters Association . " It has generated an intense interest in the subject . " <p> Advocates for minorities said they were not surprised by the conclusions . <p> " When we are covered , we are covered as criminals or illegal immigrants , " said Angela Arboleda , a policy analyst for the National Council of La Raza , a Latino advocacy organization .

It also eliminated 300 job openings . <p> The publisher of The Wall Street Journal announced plans a month earlier to make limited staff cuts and other cost reductions as it struggled to cope with a sudden downturn in advertising . <p> Dow Jones had already lowered its profit forecast twice for the January-March period , but the earnings still came in below the 18 cents per share consensus of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call . <p> Dow Jones earned $ 14.7 million before one-time gains and losses , or 17 cents per share , down 81 percent from the comparable figures a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a share . <p> Dow Jones chairman and CEO Peter Kann , speaking April 12 in a conference call with analysts and reporters , said the results reflected a " soft advertising environment , which continues into April . ...

Scripps Co. reported a 22 percent decline in profits for the first quarter because of a sluggish advertising market and increased newsprint costs . <p> The company said April 10 it made $ 27.9 million from its core operations , or 35 cents a share , for the quarter that ended March 31 on revenue of $ 367.4 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 45 cents a share , on revenue of $ 410.9 million a year ago . <p> The 35 cents a share was 2 cents higher than lowered forecasts by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial-First Call . <p> Scripps warned last month that the weaker advertising market would result in earnings of 30 to 35 cents per share .

Front-page photos in The New York Times and The Washington Post both credited the cable network . <p> CNN reporter Lisa Rose Weaver and a two-person crew transmitted the pictures after rigging their videophone to a car battery for power , said Eason Jordan , CNN 's president of newsgathering . <p> During a live transmission , the videophone showed a carload of Chinese authorities pulling up and stopping the crew from taking pictures . Jordan said the authorities accused CNN of reporting in an illegal manner and using unauthorized equipment . <p> Weaver and her crew were held for questioning for four hours and the videophone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectful of the authorities , but CNN is in the news business and this was a major story , " Jordan said . " We were not doing anything but reporting and showing the news . " <p> Associated Press Television News and other networks transmitted their pictures from an APTN uplink on Hainan , the only transmitter available to send standard broadcast-quality video . APTN 's video was transmitted 25 minutes after the plane took off . <p> Television kept a close watch on the crew members throughout their journey home . ABC , CBS , NBC and the cable news networks each interrupted normal programming on April 12 for live coverage when the crew completed the Guam-to-Hawaii leg of their voyage . <p> CNN 's pictures of the crew getting off the plane in Guam also led to conflict . <p> Jordan said CNN on April 11 reserved the island 's only satellite transmission facility for a 24-hour period surrounding the crew 's arrival . That allowed CNN to transmit the only live pictures when the plane landed . <p> After CNN finished its report , it allowed other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jordan said . <p> Rival networks , however , accused CNN of going against protocol . They contend that when there is a limited ability to transmit breaking news , networks do n't try to enforce exclusivity . <p> " If you 're in a car race , you beat the other guy by being a better driver , not by buying the road , " said Leroy Sievers , executive producer of ABC 's " Nightline . " <p> A Fox News Channel spokesman , Robert Zimmerman , told the Post that CNN 's actions in Guam were " a disservice to millions of Americans that do n't get cable . " <p> Jordan said those comments were sour grapes . " I doubt if the tables were turned they would be feeling quite this way about it , " he said . <p> Although CNN had the exclusive footage , other networks could retrieve it via satellite . ABC did so during a live report around midnight . <p> Bob Murphy , ABC senior vice president , said the network had been led to believe it had booked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden our confirmed booking became not a confirmed booking , " he said . <p> With no explanation for why it was denied satellite time , ABC believed the footage sent by CNN was fair game , Murphy said . <p> Jordan said CNN played hardball with competitors but was fair . <p> " We are in an intensely competitive business , " he said . " When it comes to breaking news , nobody does it better than CNN and we intend to win every one of these competitive battles . We want to do it in a way that is not unfair to our competition , and that 's why we allowed people to feed tape with us . " <p> There 's some lingering bitterness between ABC and CNN . ABC accused CNN of breaking an embargo two weeks ago when it telecast information about an interview with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh . ABC had provided details of the interview to The Associated Press . <p> &gt;+++++ Former Cleveland TV personality remains suspect in closed stalking case <p> CLEVELAND ( AP ) - A prosecutor closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television personality who committed suicide last year remains the main suspect . <p> Joel Rose , a retired talk show host on Cleveland television and radio stations , killed himself Aug. 4 , the day The Plain Dealer reported that he was being investigated for allegedly sending sexually explicit mailings to women . The mailings sometimes included lingerie or sexually suggestive messages . <p> Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William Mason said April 11 he decided to close the investigation because there were no new leads . He said the last suspected mailing was Feb. 18 , 2000 , the day Rose , 64 , apparently learned he was being investigated . <p> Rose was formerly a television newscaster and talk show host at WEWS in Cleveland and conducted talk shows on several Cleveland radio stations . Five other people were investigated but eliminated as suspects , Mason said . <p> Rose 's daughter , Lauren Reed , in Manitowoc , Wis. , said the family was dismayed at the prosecutor 's decision . <p> " There really is no closure here , " she said . " We feel very unsettled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a lot of circumstantial evidence , but there is also nothing that directly ties him in . " <p> Mason said his staff interviewed all the victims and inspected 96 mailings . He said there was no evidence that directly linked Rose to the mailings but said circumstantial evidence " most likely " would have led him to take a stalking or menacing case against Rose to a grand jury . <p> DNA from saliva on stamps did not match Rose , but Mason said it was odd that saliva was found on stamps that were prepasted . <p> " The level of saliva that was on the stamps was unusual and may have been intentionally applied , " Mason said . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> PEOPLE : <p> CNN founder Turner says he was suicidal after losing job and Jane <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) - CNN founder Ted Turner was suicidal after the breakup of his marriage to Jane Fonda and his loss of control of Turner Broadcasting in the reorganization of AOL Time Warner , according to The New Yorker . <p> " I felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" Before that , she was not a religious person . That 's a pretty big change for your wife of many years to tell you . That 's a shock . " <p> Turner is a strident nonbeliever , having lost his faith after his sister , Mary Jane , died of a painful disease called systemic lupus erythematosus . " I was taught that God was love and God was powerful , " Turner said . " And I could n't understand how someone so innocent should be made or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " superachiever , " attributing that to his upbringing . He told The New Yorker his father was often drunk , beat him and sent him to military school . <p> " He thought that people who were insecure worked harder , and I think that 's probably true , " Turner said . " I do n't think I ever met a superachiever who was n't insecure to some degree . A superachiever is somebody that 's never satisfied . " <p> Now that he no longer has a direct hand in the media business he founded , Turner is pursuing environmental causes and seeking to improve life for the world 's poor and reduce the nuclear threat . <p> His next project is to team up with Bill Moyers for a series of PBS documentaries on world issues , for which the Turner Foundation will provide half the financing . <p> &gt;+++++ Bornstein named president of ABC Television <p> BURBANK , Calif .
