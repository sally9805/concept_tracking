A presentation of The Learning Channel and BBC Worldwide 40 minutes // What does it mean to be human ? To have a beating heart ? To use our brains ? Being a human goes far beyond simple definition . " The Human Body " takes a look at what makes our bodies so unique-from the inside out . From the time we wake up each morning , our bodies go through complex processes just to keep up the daily routine of life . When we first open our eyes in the morning , the top layer of cells is burnt off the retina , leaving our eyeballs fresh for a new day . How about eating ? From your first bite of cereal , your digestive system kicks into high gear , using powerful stomach acid and enzymes to break down your food and convert it to energy . Can you imagine actually seeing this happen ? In this new movie , you can . The story begins in London where a family is getting ready for school and work . We watch Luke ride his bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense heat produced-just from riding a bike ! Zannah puts in her favorite CD and blasts it through headphones . See what her ear does to handle this high-decibel sound . Photograph Using thermal x-ray imaging , we see Luke ride his bike to school , followed closely by his dog . We are able to see the amount of heat given off by his body , as well as the blood pumping through his veins . Photograph ( Above ) Eight-year-old Zannah blasts music through her headphones , unaware of its effect on her eardrums . Electron microscopy allows us to see an eardrum up close . ( Inset ) Zannah 's cochlea , or eardrum , pulsates to the rhythm of her favorite song . // Perhaps the most fascinating part of the movie is when we see how a baby is brought into the world . A woman named Heather has just learned she 's pregnant and the audience gets to see each stage of the baby 's development over the course of nine months . Think the only cool special effects are ones with exploding buildings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has amazing graphics , naturally . Our bodies are a maze of colors , movement , and effects beyond our imagination . The movie is in IMAX format , so look for it to come to an IMAX theater near you . Take the wildest trip of your life-inside your body ! The Head Bone 's Connected to the Neck Bone : The Weird , Wacky , and Wonderful X-ray by Carla Killough McClafferty Farrar , Straus and Giroux Publishing 136 pages Over a century ago , a German scientist stumbled upon an amazing discovery . During some routine gas experiments , Dr. Wilhelm Roentgen noticed a green light glowing from a test tube onto a stack of papers . This light was so powerful it went through every item he tried , except for lead . Dr. Roentgen placed his hand in front of the light and saw the bones of his very own hand ! Could it be real or just a freak of nature ? Of course it was real , and what we know to be x-rays today . The medical world was never the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured as x-rays developed . When you go to the dentist , you may get your teeth x-rayed . Most of the time they put a heavy smock over you while the x-ray is being taken . This is because the x-ray light is so powerful it can damage the inside of your body . Before scientists knew this , many were hurt badly . Now that we use x-rays safely , they continue to advance our scientific and medical knowledge . X-rays are used to examine fine art , to examine broken bones , and even to help make airplanes !
