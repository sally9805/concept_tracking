Preface " This Mess " // This is a very personal book . It is a snapshot of motherhood - of parenthood , really - as I found it in Washington , D.C. , and its suburbs from the fall of 2000 to the summer of 2004 . And although in writing it I made every effort to take my research further-away from the big cities of the East Coast , back in time to the colonial roots of America 's cultural history , then forward again to our day-I know that what I have written here is not an encyclopedic overview of Motherhood , Now and Forever . It 's not a scholarly history . Neither is it a book of self-help . It 's not a book about the work-family conflict . Nor is it about " balance , " or the problems of working mothers , or the virtues of stay-at- home motherhood . It does not contain much by way of policy . It will not tell you how to raise your children . It is , rather , an exploration of a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always doing something wrong . And it 's about a conviction I have that this feeling-this widespread , choking cocktail of guilt and anxiety and resentment and regret-is poisioning motherhood for American women today . Lowering our horizons and limiting our minds . Sapping energy that we should have for ourselves and our children . And drowning out thoughts that might lead us , collectively , to formulate solutions . The feeling has many faces but it does n't really have a name . It 's not depression . It 's not oppression . It 's a mix of things , a kind of too-muchness . An existential discomfort . A " mess , " as one woman I interviewed called it , for lack of a better word . She was n't a woman who normally lacked for words . She was a newspaper editor . A headline writer . A professional wordsmith . And yet , as she sat with me one night , half-buried in a sofa in a circle of moms , she struggled , and stumbled , as she tried to express what it was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come apart . None of it made much sense , really , she said . She was a person lucky enough to have many choices . In the hope of finding " balance " she 'd chosen to scale down her career-working part-time and at night , in order to spend as much time as possible with her nine-year-old daughter . This is the kind of arrangement that mothers are supposed to dream of . This mom knew she ought to feel blessed . But somehow , nothing had worked out as planned . Working nights meant that she was tired all the time , and cranky , and stressed . And forever annoyed with her husband . And now-her daughter was after her to get a day job . It seemed she was finding that having Mom around most of the time was n't all it was cracked up to be , particularly if Mom was forever on the edge . So what was she to do ? The woman waved her hands in circles , helplessly . " What I 'm trying to figure out- " She paused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ended up raising this princess ... how I got into ... how to get out of ... this , this , this ... this mess . " This mess . The words crackled like lightning in the suburban living room where we 'd been sitting since sunset . It was a Tuesday evening in the winter of 2002 , the bath-into-bed-time hour was past , and the moms , out for a night without kids , were exhausted . The conversation had been moving laboriously , the big issue , Motherhood , lurching heavily across the coffee table like a big medicine ball full of angst . Like the newspaper editor , the other moms did n't feel entitled to complain . By any objective measure , they had easy lives-kids in good schools , houses in good neighborhoods , dependable husbands whose incomes allowed them to mostly choose what they wanted to do with their time . Most had chosen to pursue Mommy Track jobs-part-time work , a big cut in ambition and salary . But they did n't mind that ; they knew that that was a privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ate away at them . It cast a pall on all the rest . What they could n't make peace with was the feeling that somehow , more globally , they were living Mommy Track lives . Lives filled with knee pads and bake sales and dentist 's appointments and car seats . Lives somehow lesser than those of their full-time working husbands-men who managed , when the kids ran wild in the morning , spilling their Cheerios , and losing their shoes , to lose themselves in the newspaper , fading " into black and white " at the breakfast table , as one mom put it to me , " just like Father Knows Best . " The moms ' lives were punctuated by boxer shorts on the floor and quilt-making at school , carpooling and play dates and mother-daughter book clubs , and getting in to see the right dentist and worrying about whether they had the wrong pediatrician , and , and , and , layer after layer of trivia and absurdity that sometimes made them feel like they were going out of their heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . Sometimes , everything just seemed out of control . " Living in past , present , and future all at one time , " one mom said , " I get overwhelmed . I get worried about things falling apart . " Every three months , they would blow . Every now and then , their husbands and children knew , they had to leave Mommy alone . It was a standard part of their family lives . The " Zen of the boxer shorts , " as one mother called it , could only last for so long . And the real problem was-the worst of it all was-it was n't altogether clear that what they were doing with their lives was actually worthwhile . The choices and the compromises-when all was said and done , they did n't seem to add up to all that much . Not to a great sense of achievement . Not to a great sense of pride . There was no gratitude from their families , certainly . Their husbands had started taking a tone . It sounded like : " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children simply wondered what they did with their time . Their children had almost all of them , and they just wanted more , more , more . And after years of always trying to give more , give their all , they were coming to realize that more was n't necessarily right . But what to do , then ? " The children are the center of the household and everything goes around them , " said a woman who 'd left a prestigious government job working on child-care policy because it allowed her no time with her kids . " You want to do everything and be everything for them because this is your job now . You take all the energy and enthusiasm you had in your career and you feel the need to be as successful raising your children as you were in the workplace . And you can make your kids totally crazy in the process . " " And , " another stay-at-home mom put in , " the reality is : at the end of the day , you could put your heart in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing wrong that you did . Your kids could wind up a mess , and there 's your life 's work . " There was a problem floating in the room , a problem so big and so strange that the women could n't quite name it . It was n't exactly guilt . It was n't exactly stress . It was n't exactly anger . It was all of that and more . " ... This mess . " Those two simple words were like a code-breaker . Everything became clear then , and suddenly , the sentences flew . // " It 's like they keep a tally of the did-nots . " " I am absolutely and scarily consumed by rage . " " I want my kids to think of me not just as doing for them but also as fun . " " I think we 're making ourselves crazy . " " Your kids can end up completely messed up . " " Are we neurotic , insecure ? What got us to here ? " I could n't answer those questions back then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was put off that night by those smartest-of-the-smart , well-off , and powerful women , with their Washington insider lives . All women should have problems like yours , I found myself thinking . We all should be so lucky . It was only later , when I stepped back , transcribed the conversation , and read-and read and read-more transcripts and articles and e-mails and books and policy papers , when I stepped back and listened to the cultural conversation on motherhood going on in my home and in theirs and , I believe , in all of ours , that I came to see that , indeed , most women did . Have problems like theirs . In varying forms . And in varying degress , depending on how much money and how much luck and how many real choices they had . I came to believe that all mothers in America , in differing ways and to different degrees , were caught up in The Mess . And that 's because the climate in which we now mother is , in many ways , just plain crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media . Or the Christian Right . Or George W. Bush . Or Phyllis Schlafly . Or Dr. Laura Schlessinger . Or Mrs. Doubtfire . It 's us-this generation of mothers . And it 's the way our culture has groomed and greeted us . Mixing promise with politics , feminism with " family values , " science and sound bites and religion and , above all , fear into a combustible combination that is nothing less than perfect madness // ( Continues ... ) //
