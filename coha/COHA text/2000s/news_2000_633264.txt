<p> The concepts of love and home are inextricably intertwined , as in the saying : Home is where the heart is . <p> We adorn our homes with symbols of love , decorating with hearts and flowers , framed verse and flickering candles , even more so as Valentine 's Day approaches . <p> For Jeff and Lauren Musielewicz , their Plainfield Township home is the romantic cornerstone of their lives . <p> On Valentine 's Day in 1996 , Jeff brought Lauren to the house in the Lakewood on Caton Farm subdivision so he could propose to her over a surprise candlelight dinner . The house was n't even finished yet . <p> " It was kind of weird coming to this house at nighttime while it was still under construction , " Lauren said . " I was wearing a dress ; Jeff was wearing a suit ; he 'd hired a limousine for the night , and here we were driving down an unlit gravel road . I knew where we were when we got out of the car , but I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lakewood Homes , had arranged for a heater , microwave oven and table to be placed in the house , which saw its windows installed only that morning . He also had a stereo set up . It was playing Frank Sinatra songs when they came in , and a bottle of champagne was on ice . <p> For her part , Lauren thought the setting was " nice , " but said she was n't suspecting a marriage proposal . <p> " It was Valentine 's Day , " Lauren said , " and so all my friends were saying it might be the day he proposed . But I thought no , he 's not the type who would do that . I thought we 'd wait until the house was finished . " <p> After preparing pasta in the microwave , Jeff gave her a card and then got down on his knee and proposed . <p> " This house is really special , " Lauren said . " It was special even when it was just sticks and bricks , and all the more so because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Debbie Schulze and Jeff Klaips began their lives together in separate condominiums , on the fifth and sixth floors , respectively , of the River Place development in Naperville . The first of the two apartment buildings in the complex turned condo in 1995 . The second is currently making the transition . <p> Their proximity confirmed some sage advice Jeff often heard from his mother : " My mother always says you do n't have to go far to find what you 're looking for , " Jeff said . " She always says look in your own backyard . " <p> In fact , Debbie and Jeff met at a River Place pig roast in June , a social event put on by building management so residents could meet each other . Although each of them had been told separately by the building 's owners that they 'd be perfect for one another and although they lived only a floor apart , it took the pig roast to get them together . Now , they 're inseparable . They became engaged just before Christmas , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owners told him about Debbie as soon as he moved in , and that they were apparently telling her about him as well . " I was so busy with work , I just did n't feel I had the time to pursue this , " he said . " Now my advice for people who want to meet someone is to just stay home . You do n't have to go out looking for it . Just remember to look good when you 're taking out the trash . " <p> Pat McCrary , a Realtor with Koenig &; Strey in Libertyville , said realty agents are asked to do many things when selling property , occasionally including a stint as Cupid . About three years ago , she was asked to help a man pop the question . <p> " I was in the process of selling a house to a couple that was n't married , " McCrary said . " After their bid was accepted , the couple came back to see the house for a second time . " During the visit , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an engagement ring and asked McCrary to help out . <p> " He bought a box of candy , removed a piece ( of chocolate ) and placed the engagement ring inside . The idea was that ( the box ) would be sitting out on a table when they came in , as if it were a goodwill gesture from the sellers , and when the woman went to take a piece of candy , she 'd be surprised by the ring . <p> " The real surprise was that she did n't want a piece of candy , " McCrary said . " He asked her , I asked her , he asked her again , and she kept saying no , until finally she gave in . When she saw the ring , she cried , and I had to tiptoe out to the yard while they had their private , romantic moment . " <p> McCrary said she had been asked by the man to hold onto the ring for a day or so , which made her nervous . In fact , she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we 'd developed a close relationship during his home search , and we looked at a lot of houses together , " she said . " I have sons his age , so maybe he saw me as a maternal figure . It was touching and sweet . " <p> Equally touching and sweet is the gift of a home , which Kevin Murphy gave to his wife , Donna , last summer . The two had been looking at models in the Cornerstone Lakes subdivision , being developed by Concord Homes in West Chicago , for quite a while , but were n't convinced they could afford one . <p> Then , last June , Donna and Kevin were going to Florida with some friends on the eve of her July 1 birthday , and while waiting for their flight at the airport , Kevin gave her a picture frame for a birthday present . Inside the frame : a picture of the home they had discussed buying . <p> " He 'd gone in and done all of the paperwork , " Donna said . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation , he would n't even discuss the home with me . I kept bringing it up , and he kept dismissing the subject . Then , at the airport , it was n't even my birthday yet , but he just could n't wait to give me my present . " <p> The Murphys plan to move into their new home in March . Kevin is a little concerned that future surprises will pale alongside the house , and Donna has no idea what to get him now . <p> " I asked him what I 'm supposed to do for him now for the rest of our marriage , " she said . <p> Some of their friends are concerned about the precedent Kevin has set , though he does n't seem particularly worried . " If they 're not romantic , that 's their problem , " he said . " They need to step up to the plate . " <p> Donna and Kevin and their two daughters will move into their new home at the end of March , and there 's no question this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might get a dozen roses for my birthday , not a house , " Donna said . " This is the most romantic present I could have received . It 's better than diamonds . " <p> Mary Witte is a Chicago free-lance writer.WOLIN11P$ PAPER:CHICAGO SUN-TIMES <p> This new column by Sun-Times technology writer Howard Wolinsky examines and evaluates real estate- and <p> homeowning-related sites on the Internet . <p> You might call your home a money pit . But it 's also your piggy bank . Every nickel and dime you deposit is helping build your equity , so would n't it be great if you could find out on the Internet what it 's worth , just like you can check on your stock portfolio ? <p> A free e-appraisal is available at the Home Valuation tool offered by HomeGain.com , at homegain.com of course . I decided to give it a try . <p> I plugged in my address and was impressed that the report was ready in 10 seconds flat . But I was shocked at what I found . The description of the house did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , the 1,800 square feet was right , but almost everything else was n't . <p> HomeGain said the house was 1 story ; it 's 2 . HomeGain said there are 3 bedrooms ; there are 4 . <p> Also , as part of the appraisal , Homegain mentions the price the house supposedly sold for when I bought it in 1989 . Homegain said it was $ 400,000 , about twice what I actually paid . The actual HomeGain appraisal , however , was about what I expected , based on a real-life appraisal I had done a few years back when I refinanced . <p> HomeGain also included some " comps , " prices on comparable homes that had sold in the neighborhood . But if so much data was wrong about my house , why should I believe the e-appraisal or trust the comps ? <p> Bradley Inman , chief executive officer of HomeGain.com , which also matches home sellers with real estate agents online , said HomeGain obtains the real estate descriptions from public records via Lexis-Nexus , the data service , and then applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mortgage bankers rely on the same data in preparing comps and evaluating loans . The same data is available at other sites , some of which charge $ 15 or $ 20 for a report . <p> Since the Cook County assessor 's description of my home is correct on its records , Inman assumes that the incorrect data came from the Cook County recorder , who registered the deed . <p> Clearly , an online program wo n't do as well in estimating the value of your home as a real estate broker who comes into your living room . " A Realtor brings in a hands-on feel for the market , " Inman said . " We do n't recommend making an economic decision ( based on an online appraisal ) . " <p> He compares online appraisals to online map services , which can be dead-on right or totally wrong , routing drivers down streets that do n't exist . <p> Inman recommends that users of his site contact the appropriate public agency to correct any errors , something that would not have been possible without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's one spin . <p> So , as always , caveat emptor : Home buyer and seller beware . The digital description of your house might have no bearing on reality . The market will determine the ultimate value of your home . <p> Meanwhile , DigitaLiving would like to know your experience with HomeGain.com as well as with other online real estate sites .
