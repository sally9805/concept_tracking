<p> NEW YORK  --  After the stock market bubble burst , Wall Street pundits predicted the 2000s would usher in a " low-return " world . <p> A " no-return world " would have been more accurate . <p> It 's the first day of trading in 2006 and , despite three up years in a row and a modest 3% gain last year , a buy-and-hold investor who invested $10,000 in the Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index on Dec. 31 , 1999 , would now have an investment worth $8,493 , excluding dividends . That equates to an annualized loss of 2.7% . <p> Things , of course , look much better if you do n't factor in the bear market years of 2000 ( - 10.1% ) , 2001 ( - 13.0% ) and 2002 ( - 23.4% ) : The same $10,000 investment would be worth $14,190 , which amounts to an average annual gain of 6.0% . <p> Unfortunately , there are no do-overs on Wall Street . The bear market was real . So are the resulting subpar profits stock investors have " enjoyed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is n't your father 's bull market . The ' 80s were great . The ' 90s were even better . But the ' 00s so far have been pretty much a dud . <p> " The comparison of the 2000s ( to the prior two decades ) will not be favorable from a historical perspective , " says James Stack , president of InvesTech Research . <p> It 's unlikely , for example , that the Dow Jones industrial average , which declined 0.6% in 2005 , will be able to come anywhere near its 228% gain in the ' 80s and its 318% gain in the ' 90s . The blue-chip barometer is actually down 6.8% since the end of 1999 . <p> And playing catch-up wo n't be easy . Respected market historian and statistician Roger Ibbotson of Ibbotson Associates is forecasting annual gains of 9% for stocks in coming years , below the 10.4% historical average . If he 's right , it 's almost assured that the ' 00s will go down not as a decade of greed but rather a decade of need  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a behavioral finance expert and president of Market Semiotics , says the next big bull market may not begin until 2010-11 . " Stocks , " he says , " remain in the final phase of their recovery rallies from the market lows of 2002-2003 . " The lack of a Santa Claus rally at the end of the year and an aging bull market approaching its fourth birthday spell risk . Possible 2006 scenarios range from another sideways market to a series of " minimassacres , " Dorsey says . <p> These pessimistic forecasts , of course , come amid some bullish predictions for 2006 . Ed Keon , chief investment strategist at Prudential Equity Group , for example , is forecasting a record-breaking year for the S &P; 500 . His year-end target of 1530 would mark an all-time high for the benchmark index and erase all bear-market losses dating back to March 2000 . It would also add up to a 22.6% gain . Five other Wall Street strategists polled by USA TODAY are looking for gains of 10% to 12% this year . <p> Bullish catalysts include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declining oil prices and a belief that stock prices will better reflect the earnings power of U.S. companies . <p> Still , there are many more things working against the stock market than there were in the ' 80s and ' 90s . What 's different ? <p> *Interest rates and inflation are heading up , not down . <p> At the start of the great bull market in 1982 , stocks were dirt cheap . More important , interest rates and inflation were both at double-digit levels  --  but on the verge of beginning a massive 20-year decline . In the ' 80s and ' 90s , inflation was all but eradicated , sinking to a rate of about 2% . And yields on U.S. Treasury bonds fell to their lowest levels in nearly four decades . <p> Such periods of lower inflation are bullish for stocks because it pushes investors out of inflation plays , such as gold and other hard assets , such as commodities and real estate . It also prods investors to pay more for a company 's future earnings , which results in expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But the current environment is dramatically different , says InvesTech 's Stack . <p> " We are starting with stocks fully valued and short- and long-term interest rates still hovering near four-decade lows , " says Stack . " Large bull-market moves are generally accompanied by , or preceded by , declining rates , and we do n't have that scenario today . " <p> Assuming that interest rates and inflation have no where to go but up , it means stocks will have to compete with higher-yielding bonds and cash . <p> *Long bull cycle has been replaced by long-term trading range . <p> Stock prices tend to move in long , multiyear cycles . The Dow , which was unable to break free of the 1000 level it first breached in 1966 until 1982 , basically went nowhere for 16 years . That sideways action was followed by an 18-year bull market that ended in early 2000 . <p> Now , many pundits believe the stock market is trapped in a wide trading range , characterized by flat stock prices , that could last until the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by massive overvaluation , " says John Bollinger of Bollinger Capital Management , adding that the ' 90s stock boom drove equity prices up to nosebleed levels . " What happens is the market pauses and waits for earnings to catch up . It does that by going sideways . " <p> Not until stocks sink to still lower valuation levels can the stage be set for the " next great bull market , " says Bollinger . " But I think that is still many years away . " <p> The average historical P-E for the S &P; 500 , based on trailing 12-month earnings , is 14.2 , according to Ibbotson Associates . The current P-E is 16.4 . <p> *Similarities with bearish ' 70s are abundant . <p> The ' 00s have more in common with the dreary ' 70s than the profitable ' 80s and ' 90s , says Tom Au , author of A Modern Approach to Graham &; Dodd Investing . <p> Oil prices are high , just as they were during the 1973 OPEC oil embargo . The U.S. is at war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam conflict . And while inflation remains low by historical measures , price pressures are building , echoing the high inflation days in the ' 70s made famous by the WIN ( Whip Inflation Now ) buttons . Similarly , President Bush 's approval ratings are dropping , as did Richard Nixon 's during the Watergate scandal . <p> " The economy is very much like it was in the ' 70s , " says Au . The stock market was also in a funk in the ' 70s , gaining a meager 17.2% in the decade . <p> *Winning streaks are meant to be broken . <p> The S &P; 500 has posted gains for three consecutive years . Over the past 50 years , there have been four two-year streaks , five three-year streaks , one five-year streak ( during the late ' 90s bubble years ) , and one eight-year streak ( at the beginning of the megabull that began in 1982 ) , notes Michael Panzer , a strategist at Rabo Securities . <p> The math shows that on only two of 11 occasions has there been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given that , it seems unlikely that 2006 will be an up year , " Panzer concludes . <p> What 's more , on the seven of nine occasions when the market has had two- or three-year winning streaks , the median return the following year has been - 11.4% , Panzer says . A negative year of that magnitude in 2006 would further depress returns in the disappointing ' 00s . <p> Similarly , of the 14 bull markets the S &P; 500 has enjoyed over the past 75 years , fewer than half ( six ) lived to celebrate a fourth anniversary , according to InvesTech . The current bull market is 3.2 years old , closing in fast on the average bull of 3.4 years dating back to 1932 . <p> The immediate outlook for stocks is also clouded by fears that consumer spending may slow amid a pullback in housing prices and higher borrowing costs . <p> But outlining all the risks and obstacles facing the market does not mean that stocks are on the verge of a massive collapse , says InvesTech 's Stack . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just that the current bull is in its latter innings . That does n't mean put your money under the mattress . " <p> Assuming the 9% annualized gains through the end of the decade that Ibbotson forecasts , that $10,000 investment in the S &P; 500 made at the end of 1999 would be worth $11,987 by the end of 2009 . That would amount to a 20% gain for the 2000s . Not great but at least positive . <p> Bollinger says investors can do better than the broad market by investing in the sectors and styles of stocks that are outperforming the S &P; 500 . <p> " Just focusing on what is doing well can still earn investors substantial returns , " he says . <p> Investors hoping for a replay of the ' 80s and ' 90s were probably asking for too much anyway , adds Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors . <p> " The prior two decades were unusual , " says Johnson . " These are far more normal times , but it could still be a rewarding time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 9% , which is not bad . " <p> Just not as exciting as the 20% annual gains made famous in the ' 80s and ' 90s.
