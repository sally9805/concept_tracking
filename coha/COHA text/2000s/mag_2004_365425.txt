He looks as if he might die . Gaunt and grim , young George Lucas paces the set of Star Wars , in Pinewood Studios near London . He and everyone else know the movie is hurtling toward chaos . His favorite toys  --  R2D2 and C-3P0  --  keep breaking . The actors are fretting because he wo n't talk to them . ( Carrie Fisher recalls that Lucas " lost his voice at one point . We did n't know that for days . " ) Industrial Light &; Magic , his band of cybergeeks back in Los Angeles , has n't finished its computer shots  --  because ILM is still building the computers . The 20th Century Fox board of directors is sending unhelpful memos ( e.g. , the Wookie should wear pants ) . The Fox boss , Alan Ladd Jr. , has insisted that the last two weeks of principal shooting be done in one manic week . And the frail 32-year-old with a galaxy of ideas in his head seems near implosion . As Mark Hamill recalls , " He really looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was 1976 , as portrayed in the new documentary Empire of Dreams : The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy . On May 25 , 1977 , Star Wars opened , and it instantly altered the way Hollywood would do business , tell stories , reinvent reality . Yet at first the moguls did n't understand the revolution Lucas kick-started . " George was enormously farsighted , " Gareth Wigan , the Fox executive on the Star Wars set , says in the documentary .

( Last weekend , more than two weeks before it could be shipped , the box set was No. 1 in Amazon.com DVD sales . ) The films  --  Star Wars , The Empire Strikes Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . They will be adorned with many beguiling extras , such as an interactive video game , Battlefront , the making-of documentary and a peek at next year 's completion of the saga , Revenge of the Sith  --  which , whatever you 've heard , will be the series ' final chapter . <P> Be warned : this is not your dweeby uncle 's or your inner child 's Star Wars . Not the trilogy that opened in 1977 , 1980 and 1983 , but the newer improved special editions of 1997 , the ones with some new footage and updated computer effects . Says Jim Ward , president of LucasArts : " Those are the versions of the film George had always envisioned . It 's really an artist 's prerogative . " <P> In the documentary Lucas speaks of perfecting " things that I had to give up on because I just did n't have the time or money or the power . " The DVDs have even newer shots that tie elements of Lucas ' first trilogy and his more recent one  --  you may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in diapers when Jedi was made  --  to make the grand story line flow more coherently.
