// COVER STORY A week with the U.S. Air Force 's little-known commando unit . * When it comes to versatility , it is hard to beat the Air Force Special Operations Command ( AFSOC ) . " We are the Air Force 's only ground combat force , " says Capt . Mike Martin , chief of current operations for AFSOC 's 720th Special Tactics Group ( STG ) . " There are some base ground defense units , but we go forward . " For the memtiers of this elite combat team , going forward means swimming with the Navy 's SEALs , jumping with the Army 's Special Forces and Rangers , and hitting the beaches with the Marines ' Force Recon . And then their real work begins . The job of AFSOC " operators " is to quickly turn a patch of hostile terrain into a fully functional airfield . Sometimes this means a stealthy attack by motorcycle and ATV . Other times it means cleaning out hostile forces by scouting locations for the delivery of 15,000  --  pound BLU-82 Daisy Cutter bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the forefront in the war on terrorism . During the closing months of 2001 , AFSOC Special Tactics ( ST ) combat controllers were the critical element in the surgically precise airstrikes in Afghanistan . Using systems like the Special Operations Forces Laser Marker ( SOFLAM ) - at left , which creates the spot that laser-guided bombs aim for-team members precisely marked terrorist locations for destruction . Despite their highly visible success , this elite force remained little known to those outside the military . When POPULAR MECHANICS inquired how the Air Force trained these elite troops , we were invited to take a closer look for ourselves by observing them in action at their headquarters , at Special Operations Command at Hurlburt Field , Fla . No Beginners Cryptic military terms convey only the slightest hint of what this unit is really about . In the chain of command , AFSOC is the Air Force component of the U.S. Special Operations Command.There are 19 AFSOC Special Tactics units , called " flights . " Each flight consists of 18 men , called operators , who are trained in combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 flights are on continuous worldwide alert every hour of the day , every day of the year . As detailed as their assignments may seem , they omit one essential fact.To get to work , ST operators must be highly skilled in parachuting and underwater and amphibious operations along with small-unit combat tactics . There is no easy way to join the ranks of AFSOC . But one of the best routes into this Air Force unit is to first join the Army , Navy or Marines and distinguish yourself as a Ranger , SEAL or member of Force Recon. // " When you look at the special operations force skills that we possess , it includes all the characteristics and attributes possessed by our counterparts : Navy SEALs , Army Rangers , Army Special Forces and Marine Corps Force Recon . And the reason is so that we can seamlessly operate with those units on the battlefield , " says Capt . Chris Larkin , acting commander for the 720th 's 23rd Special Tactics Squadron and supervisor for ST Advanced Skills Training . Primed For Combat During PM 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy SEALs , Marine Corps Force Recon and in Army Special Forces . For example , Air Force Staff Sgt. Daniel-wartime rules prevent us from giving his last name-wears both the Ranger and Special Forces tabs above his stripes , reflecting his prior service with the Army 's 1 st Battalion , 75th Ranger Regiment ( " A Week With The Airborne Rangers , " June 2001 , page 58 ) and 20th Special Forces Group . " I had worked with the Combat Control Teams previously , when I was in the Ranger battalion , and I had seen what they were doing and who they worked with-SEALs , Special Forces . It was n't just a straightforward job , " Daniel says . " It was really diversified . And that 's why I crossed over . " AFSOC Combat Control Team ( CCT ) training takes more than 18 months of grueling work , as trainees learn the requisite basic and advanced special operations skills . Physical , mental and emotional toughness are the basic requirements . What Air Force training turns out is guys-no women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , while they fight off someone who is trying very hard to kill them . We watch this philosophy in action at a swimming pool where a small group of ST students are receiving " pre-scuba " instruction during the 60-day Water Phase of the training.Today 's lesson is " buddy breathing " on a single snorkel . It is normally not a hard task to master.The ST twist is to simulate the physical and mental challenges of a real combat situation . A mountainous Air Force instructor adds this extra note of realism by joining the trainees in the pool , where he proceeds to climb on their backs , yank off their masks , hold their heads underwater and try to block their airways . Combat Gear Performing a diversified job requires a diversified range of combat hardware . Air Force ST operators carry a variety of small arms , including the M9 9mm pistol with sound suppressor , the Remington 870 12-ga. shotgun , Photograph Specialized training and precision locating equipment paid off in Afghanistan where the United States was able to precisely target a Taliban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40mm grenade launcher , the M4A1 SOPMOD ( Special Operations Peculiar Modification ) 5.56mm carbine , and the M249 5.56mm SAW ( Squad Automatic Weapon ) . Photograph Based on the design of a dune buggy , the RATT is the world 's most advanced combat medical evacuation vehicle . Photograph AFSOC operators use the most powerful small arms in the Special Forces arsenal . Photograph // As an austere expeditionary advance force , ST combat controllers also must have the capability to establish a remote airfield . They do this using equipment ranging from a Nikon Total Station survey set that can quickly lay out a landing strip to pocket-size landing lights . Increasingly important in the era of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and GPS-guided smart bombs are AFSOC 's weather forecasting tools . The 720th 's 10th Combat Weather Squadron , which includes detachments throughout the special operations community , is equipped with the Kestrel 4000 handheld station and the new Remote Miniature Weather Station . AFSOC operators need to move fast . In addition to small boats such as the Zodiac F470 series Combat Rubber Raiding Craft , ST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  terrain vehicles , and tactical wheeled vehicles . Included in that arsenal is the GRC-206 Mobile Communications Vehicle , an Air Force Humvee equipped with a sophisticated package of communications hardware . Perhaps the most unusual piece of AFSOC wheeled gear is the Rescue All Terrain Transport ( RATT ) . Derived in the early 1990s from a commercial dune buggy design , RATTs support pararescue missions by providing highly mobile battlefield trauma care . Each RATT carries a driver and two pararescue personnel . Six stretchers fold out to carry the wounded to an aid or evacuation station . Flying Low The United States is able to best enemy forces by making extensive tactical use of night vision gear . But before you can fight at night you need to get on the ground without announcing your arrival . AFSOC 's airborne capabilities are provided by the 16th Special Operations Wing , which is based at Hurlburt Field in the United States , and by Special Operations Groups at RAF Mildenhall , England , and Kadena Air Base , Japan . Arriving at the 16th Wing 's 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of one of the MH-53M Pave Low helicopters for a briefing on the platform 's capabilities . " It 's the most sophisticated helicopter in the world , " Capt . Rob says . " We can put this thing low and jerk it around pretty good . That 's what 's unique about our mission.The fighter guys have to worry about threats but they do n't have to deal with the stress of possibly killing themselves . We go out at night at 50 ft. or lower , on a black night , with night vision goggles , and it 's a daily worry about whether or not you 're going to fly into a small house or a small tower . With terrainfollowing and terrain-avoidance radar , in really bad weather , I have to climb up to 100 ft . And then it 's the system that 's giving us our cues . But if you can actually see out there with the goggles you can put this thing really low and make some pretty tight turns . " The squadron is in the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Models to the latest " M " designator . However , current plans have the squadron replacing some of these helicopters with the Air Force Special Operations tiltrotor CV-22 . Air Force planners project initial operational capability for the first six CV-22s at Hurlburt Field sometime in 2008 . Photograph Behind AFSOC pilots are teams of maintainers , including both men and women , who keep the aircraft and weapons in fighting condition . // Spooky And Spectre AFSOC 's most fearsome weapons are its massive gunships , which are derived from C-130 transports.The Wing 's 8th and 15th SOSes respectively fly the MC-130E and MC-130H Combat Talon and Combat Talon II . In addition to providing global , adverse-weather capability , day and night , Combat Talons can deliver the 15,000  --  pound Daisy Cutters that proved so deadly in Afghanistan . Slightly more precise but equally devastating firepower is delivered by the 16th Wing 's AC-130 gunships.The Wing has two models : the AC-130H " Spectre " flown by the 16th SOS and the AC-130U " Spooky " flown by the 4th SOS . With a sobering array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle a target area , delivering overwhelming amounts of fire with television-targeted and computer-guided accuracy . On board one of the 4th SOS 's " U " models , we notice that this newer version differs from the " H " model in being pressurized and in supplementing the earlier configuration 's 105mm howitzer and 40mm cannon with an additional five-barrel 25mm Gatling gun.The weapon combination represents a mind-numbing lethality . Rounding out the AFSOC air assets are the MC-130P Combat Shadow and the EC-130 Commando Solo.The Combat Shadow penetrates hostile lines to provide midair refueling for special operations helicopters , while the Commando Solo provides a sky-based radio and television station for psychological operadons and civil affairs messages . As the inside story of the war in Afghanistan begins to unfold in the months ahead , AFSOC will undoubtedly emerge as a pivotal reason for the United States ' success.The array of advanced weapons that ST teams bring to the battlefield are only part of the story.The extraordinary men , distinguished by both their skill and their attitude , are the backbone of this unique force . " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Master Sergeant Bob Martens , " but they 're doing extraordinary things , day in and day out . " Photograph AFSOC gunships , like the " Ghostriders " AC- 1300 , lay down a virtual wall of metal that can neutralize any ground troops .
