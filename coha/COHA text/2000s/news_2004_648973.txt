<p> For 30 days last winter , the University of Utah tailback Marty Johnson wore nothing but an orange jumpsuit and flimsy sandals . <p> Johnson 's second drunken-driving arrest had landed him in the Salt Lake County Jail . In this conservative state , pressure mounted on Utah Coach Urban Meyer to kick Johnson off the team . <p> Instead , Meyer used his family and his football program to rehabilitate Johnson . To allow Johnson back on the team , Meyer set up a strict regimen for him that included alcohol rehabilitation , calls to Meyer every weekend night and a focus on academics with an eye toward Johnson 's earning his degree . <p> In less than a year , Johnson has gone from inmate to college graduate . He is also Utah 's starting tailback , and success stories like these have caused the 40-year-old Meyer to emerge as one of the most sought-after coaches in college football . <p> The man behind the Utes ' 9-0 record , No. 7 ranking and 13-game winning streak has built Utah into an unlikely power by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coach Meyer is different , " Johnson said . " It is n't just about football with him . " <p> Meyer 's wife , Shelley , has a degree in psychiatric nursing with a specialty in addiction . After much deliberation and prayer , the Meyers agreed that they could save Johnson . They visited him in jail , and their 11-year-old daughter , Gigi , wrote him letters of support . <p> Whenever Urban Meyer doubted his decision , he would peek at a copy of an article from Utah 's student newspaper that he kept on his desk . The article was about an innocent victim in a drunken-driving accident . <p> " There 's no way I could let this kid go , " he said . " He would have killed someone . I could n't live with that . " <p> So far , the story has turned out well . Johnson has scored a team-high 12 touchdowns , and he still talks to Gigi on the phone . Shelley calls once a week and sends cards of encouragement . Johnson said that his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meyer family showed him . " He taught me a lot of things about life , " Johnson said . " Everyone sees his intensity . I 've seen the other side . " <p> Those two sides , intense but caring , are legacies of his mentors , from his mother and father to the two coaches who influenced him most , Earle Bruce and Sonny Lubick . <p> The most influential mentor was his father , Bud Meyer , who made young Urban and his two sisters run laps around their house in Ashtabula , Ohio , or do push-ups and sit-ups if they came home late . His mother , Gisela , offered balance , sliding them an extra dessert when they finished . " They were the perfect team , " Urban Meyer said . <p> But academics were also important for Bud Meyer , a chemical engineer . He taught his children the basics of advanced mathematics before they went to kindergarten . Urban Meyer recalled one summer when he was 8 or 9 when his father held in-home summer classes in ethics , philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children came home from college , their father did all the problems in their textbooks for fun . ) <p> Bud Meyer also stressed family , once ordering Urban to beat up some bullies who had picked on his younger sister , Erika , when she was in first grade . While Urban got in trouble in school for the incident , his father sat him at the head of the table at dinner that night . <p> " From Day 1 , Urban was raised to be nothing but a man and a jock , " said Erika Jones , a Web analyst and a doctoral student in Cincinnati . " He had to be tough . My dad never let up on him . " <p> The two Meyer girls skipped grades , but Urban was not allowed to because it would have put him at a disadvantage in athletics . Urban worked out religiously , with Bud and Gisela allowing him to keep his weight set in the family dining room , next to the china cabinet . <p> Four of Bud Meyer 's relatives had played minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , when the Atlanta Braves made him a 13th-round draft pick in 1982 . <p> Less than a week after graduating , Urban flew to Florida for rookie ball . Overwhelmed and lonely , he called home from a pay phone one night to say he was quitting . Bud Meyer said that was fine and to make sure to call his mother , but he was never welcome in the Meyer home again . <p> " I was waiting for the punch line , " Urban Meyer said . " But it never came . " <p> Meyer stuck it out for two years , until an arm injury derailed his career . Still , he knew he lacked the physical gifts to make it to the majors . <p> One night during his second minor-league season , Meyer said , he went to bed at 9 p.m. after doing his typical 200 push-ups . His roommate came home much later , stumbling drunk with a woman on his arm . The next day , Meyer struck out three times while his roommate hit two home runs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I realized that . " <p> With his baseball dreams dashed , Meyer turned back to football . He walked on one season at the University of Cincinnati , playing safety and special teams . That year , he made connections that got him a graduate assistant slot under Earle Bruce at Ohio State in 1986 . <p> Meyer was awed by how hard Bruce pushed his players while caring about them so much . <p> " Urban was fascinated by the way that Earle won , " said Meyer 's other sister , Gigi Escoe . " He was just amazed by him . Earle has a temperament a lot like my dad , and Urban was fascinated to see that applied to football . " <p> After two years as a graduate assistant , Meyer went to Illinois State as an assistant , but he reconnected with Bruce at Colorado State as a wide receivers coach two years later . <p> Bruce 's intensity was so fierce that he painted the opposing locker rooms pink to psyche out the other team . His focus was so severe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first child was born , not long after all his players had hugged and congratulated him . <p> " That 's what I loved about him , " Meyer said . " He was just so focused on the next opponent . " <p> The feelings were reciprocated , as Bruce always respected Meyer 's work ethic and ability . " You could tell he was going to move up fast , " Bruce said . <p> While Meyer learned a lot under Bruce , it was not until Bruce was fired at Colorado State and Sonny Lubick took over that Meyer became a complete coach . <p> Lubick offered a decisively different style from Bruce . He walked into the first team meeting and told the players he did not care how they wore their hair or what type of jewelry they wore . He said there were no rules , except stay out of trouble and respect everyone . <p> For Meyer , Lubick 's approach offered a drastic philosophical change and a turning point in his career . Lubick called Meyer into his office and told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Meyer rode him too hard . <p> " I was nuts , " Meyer said . " It was a free-for-all . I learned that you ca n't get personal , that you have to let kids be kids . No doubt in my mind , I would n't be here today without Sonny Lubick . " <p> From Colorado State , Meyer 's career took off . He emerged as a top recruiter and had coaches begging him to join their staff . After six seasons at Colorado State , Meyer could not resist when Notre Dame called . He served a year under Lou Holtz and was retained when Bob Davie took over in 1997 . <p> After five years at Notre Dame , Bruce persuaded the athletic director at Bowling Green , Paul Krebs , to interview Meyer for the head coaching job . <p> Meyer 's intensity and organization took over from there , as he met Krebs at a Holiday Inn off Interstate 69 outside Fort Wayne , Ind . Over dinner , with barbecue sauce spilled on his yellow legal notebook , Meyer diagrammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left there thinking he was young , " Krebs said , " but he was the most prepared of all the candidates . " <p> Meyer got the job , even though he had never been an offensive or a defensive coordinator . <p> In his first season , Meyer won at Missouri in his opening game and took a team that had won two games its previous season to an 8-3 record . The next year he went 9-3 , then left for Utah . <p> In Salt Lake , Meyer again installed stern discipline and a spread-option offense that transformed quarterback Alex Smith from a third-stringer to a Heisman contender . Meyer took a team that had won five games in 2002 and brought it to 10-2 last season . This year , the Utes have a realistic chance to go undefeated . With Meyer 's name flying around the job rumor mill , he may not be in Salt Lake City much longer . <p> But there is no denying Meyer 's impact on the team and the program . Just ask Marty Johnson . <p> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson said . " He got us a new Jumbotron and a new practice facility . We could go 11-0 and not make a B.C.S. game . I do n't think that 's fair to him . He deserves to be on that higher-level spotlight .
