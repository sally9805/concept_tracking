The manager of Ninotchka was a wiseguy named Dominick La Paglia . Not a made man , but mob-connected , with a string of arrests dating back to when he was seventeen . Served time on two separate occasions , once for assault with intent , the other for dealing drugs . He insisted the club was clean , you could n't even buy an inhaler in the place . " We get an older crowd here , " La Paglia said . " Ninotchka is all about candlelight and soft music . A balalaika band , three violinists wandering from table to table during intermission , the old folks holding hands when they 're not on the floor dancing . Never any trouble here , go ask your buddies up Narcotics . " " Tell us about Max Sobolov , " Carella said . This was now eleven P.M. on Wednesday night , the sixteenth day of June . The three men were standing in the alleyway where the violinist had been shot twice in the face . " What do you want to know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " " Long time . Two years ? " " You hired a blind violinist , right ? " " Why not ? " " To wander from table to table , right ? " " Place is dark , anyway , what difference would it make to a blind man ? " La Paglia said . " He played violin good . Got blinded in the Vietnam War , a war hero , somebody aces him in an alleyway . " " How about the other musicians working here ? Any friction between Sobolov and them ? " Meyer asked . " No , he was blind , " La Paglia said . " Everybody 's very nice to blind people . " Except when they shoot them twice in the face , Carella thought . " Or anybody else in the club ? Any of the bartenders , waitresses , whoever ? " " Cloakroom girl ? " " Bouncer ? Whoever ? " " No , he got along with everybody . " " So tell us what happened here tonight , " Carella said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was here . " " Give us the sequence , " Meyer said , and took out his notebook . The way La Paglia tells it , the club closes at two in the morning every night of the week . The band plays its last set at one thirty , the violinists take their final stroll , angling for tips , at a quarter to . Bartenders have already served their last-call drinks , waitresses are already handing out the checks . . . " You know the Cole Porter line ? " La Paglia asked . " ' Before the fiddlers have fled ' ? One of the greatest lyrics ever written . That 's what closing time is like . But this must 've been around ten , ten thirty when Max went out for a smoke . We do n't allow smoking in the club , half the geezers have emphysema , anyway . I was at the bar , talking to an old couple who are regulars , they never take a table , they always sit at the bar . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about moving down to Florida . They were telling me all about Sarasota when I heard the shots . " " You recognized them as shots ? " La Paglia raised his eye think I do n't know shots when I hear them ? " No , " he said sarcastically . " I thought they were backfires , right ? " " What 'd you do ? " " I ran out in the alley . He was already dead . Laying on his back , blood all over his face . White cane on the ground near his right hand . " " See anybody ? " " Sure , the killer hung around to be identified . " Meyer was thinking sarcasm did n't play too well on a mobster . The Sobolov family was sitting shiva . Meyer had been here , done this , but today was the first time Carella had ever been to a Jewish wake . He simply followed suit . When he saw Meyer taking off his shoes outside the open door to the apartment , he took off his shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors can come in without distracting the mourners , " Meyer told him . " No knocking or ringing of bells . " He was washing his hands in a small basin of water resting on a chair to the right of the door . Carella followed suit . " I 'm not a religious person , " Meyer said . " I do n't know why we wash our hands before going in . " This was all so very new to Carella . There were perhaps two dozen people in the Sobolov living room . Five of them were sitting on low benches . Meyer later explained that these were supplied by the funeral home . All of the mirrors in the house were covered with cloth , and a large candle was burning in one corner of the room . In accordance with Jewish custom , Sobolov had been buried at once , and the family had begun sitting shiva as soon as they got home from the funeral . This was now Friday morning , the eighteenth day of June . The men in the family had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carella had been to Irish wakes , where the women keened , but where there was also laughter and much drinking . He had been to Italian wakes , where the women shrieked and tore at their clothing . The prevailing mood here was silent grief . The apartment belonged to Max 's younger brother and his wife . The brother 's name was Sidney . The wife was Susan . Both of Max 's parents were dead , but there was an elderly uncle present , and also several cousins . The uncle spoke with a heavy accent , Russian or Middle European , it was difficult to tell which . He told the detectives stories about when Max was still a little boy . How his parents had purchased for him a toy violin that Max took to at once . . . " You should have seen him , a regular Yehudi Menuhin ! " The brother Sidney told them that his parents had immediately started Max taking lessons . . . " On a real violin , never mind a toy , " the uncle said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated violin pieces . . . " His teacher was astonished ! " " He had such an aptitude , " one of the cousins said . " A natural , " Sidney agreed . " He was so sensitive , so feeling . " " The kindest person . " " Such a sweet little boy . " " When he played , your heart could melt . " " All his goodness came out in his playing . " " What a player ! " the uncle said . Sidney told them that no one was surprised when his brother was accepted at the Kleber School , or when Kusmin put him in his private class . " Alexei Kusmin , " he explained . " The head of violin studies there . " " Max had of course . . . " one of the cousins said . " He got drafted . " " The war , " his uncle said , and clucked his tongue . " Vietnam . " " Twenty-fifth Infantry Division . " " Second Brigade . " " D Company . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sidney , it was D. " " I used to write to him , it was B. " " All right , already . Whatever it was , he came back blind . " " Dreadful , " Susan said , and shook her head . " It began at the hospital , " his uncle said . " The drug use . " " Before then , " his brother said . " It started over there . In Vietnam . " " But mostly , it was the hospital . " " Medicinal , " his brother said , nodding . " The VA hospital . " This was the first the detectives were hearing about drug use . They listened . " And also , you know , musicians , " one of the cousins said . " It 's prevalent . " " But mostly the pain , " the uncle said . " Understandable , " another cousin said . " Besides , everybody smokes a little grass every now and then , " a third cousin said . " It should only be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagged his head sympathetically . " And yet , " his brother said , " right to the day he died , he was the sweetest , most loving person on earth . " " A wonderful human being . " " A mensch , " the uncle agreed . Only one of the girls was really beautiful , but the other one was cute , too . He had n't expected either of them to be prizes . You call an escort service , they 're not about to send you a couple of movie stars . The woman on the phone y black . " Price is no object , " he 'd said . " Just so you know , it 's a thousand for each girl for the night . Comes to two K , plus a tip is customary . " " No problem , " he 'd said . " Usually twenty percent . " He thought this was high , but he said nothing . " Which 'll come to twenty-four hundred total . You could make it an even twenty-five , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd asked . " American Express , Visa , or MasterCard , " she 'd said . " What time did you want them ? " " Seven sharp , " he 'd said . " Can you make it a blonde and a redhead ? " " How about a nice Chinese girl ? " " No , not tonight . " " Or a luscious sistuh ? " He wondered if she had herself in mind . " Just a blonde and a redhead . In their twenties , please . " " Le'me find you suppin nice , " she 'd said . The blonde was the real beauty . She told him her name was Trish . He did n't think this was her real name . The redhead was the cute one . She said her name was Reggie , short for Regina , which he had to believe because who on earth would chose Regina as a phony name ? He guessed Trish was in her mid-twenties . Reggie said she was nineteen . He believed that , too . " So what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was the bubbly one . Wearing a short little black cocktail dress , high-heeled black sandals . Reggie was wearing green , to match her green eyes . Serious look on her Irish phizz , she should have been wearing glasses . Better legs than Trish , cute little cupcake breasts as opposed to the melons Trish was bouncing around . Neither of them was we Taj Mahal . " Lookee here , two bedrooms ! " Trish said . " We can try both of them ! " Before morning , they 'd used both beds , and the big Jacuzzi tub in the marbled bathroom . It had n't worked anywhere . " Why do n't we try it again tonight ? " Trish suggested now . " I have other plans , " he told her . " Then how about tomorrow night ? " she said . " Maybe , " he said . " Well , think about it , " she said , and gave his limp cock a playful little tug , and then went off to shower . Reggie was drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panties , tufts of wild red hair curling around the leg holes . Freckles on her bare little breasts . Nipples puckered . " We could do this alone sometime , you know , " she said . He looked at her . " Just you and me . Sometimes it works better alone . " He kept looking at her . " Sometimes two girls are intimidating . Alone , we could do things we did n't try last night . " " Like what ? " " Oh , I do n't know . We 'll experiment . " " We will , huh ? " " If you want to , " she said . " Give it another try , you know ? " She lifted her coffee cup , drank , put it down on the table again . " And you would n't have to go through the service , " she said . Down the hall , he could hear the shower going .
