The " great man " theory of history has been out of fashion for decades . Historians trying to explain the course of human events point to geography or climate or technology . They explore the everyday life of ordinary people and the tides of change that sweep through whole populations . When they write about individual historical actors , the emphasis tends to be on psychology . Kings and Queens , Presidents and Prime Ministers may affect events at the margins , but the notion that history happens because someone decided it should happen is regarded as unenlightening if not simply wrong . <P> About Gulf War II and its consequences ( whatever they may be ) , though , the " great man " theory is correct , and the great man is President George W. Bush . Great in this context does not necessarily mean good or wise . It does usually suggest a certain largeness of character or presence on the stage , which Bush does not possess . Whatever gods gave him this role were casting against type . But the role is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the result of one man 's deliberate , sudden and unforced decision . Yes , Saddam Hussein deserves the ultimate moral blame , but Bush pushed the button . <P> Bush 's decision to make war on Iraq may have been visionary and courageous or reckless and tragic or anything in between , but one thing it was n't was urgently necessary . For Bush , this war was optional . Events did not impose it on him . Few public voices were egging him on . He had n't made an issue of the need for " regime change " during the presidential campaign or made it a priority in the early months of his Administration . If he had completely ignored Iraq through the 2004 election , the price would have been a few disappointed Administration hawks and one or two grumpy op-eds . But something or someone put this bee in his bonnet , and from a standing start , history took off . Thousands died , millions were freed from tyranny ( we hope ) , billions were spent , a region was shaken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched it all on TV . <P> Compare America 's other wars of the past 60 years . All of them had , if not inevitability , at least a bit of propulsion from forces larger than one man 's desire . Gulf War I was provoked by an actual event : Iraq 's occupation of Kuwait . George the Elder did n't have to make war , but he had to do something . Vietnam , famously , was never an explicit decision . Even the parody war in Grenada had a few captive American medical students to force its way onto the agenda . Some people believe that Franklin Roosevelt personally , deliberately and even dishonestly maneuvered a reluctant America into World War II . But World War II was history boiling over and impossible to avoid one way or another .
