Graph Not Transcribed A boy sits in the middle of his room surrounded by a dozen action figures based on characters from his favourite TV shows . He 's having a great time as he crashes one toy on another , lines up a few more to take high dives off the bed and sends the odd one flying across the room . What 's wrong with this picture ? If you ask me , nothing . However , if you ask some play pundits , this child is engaged in play of questionable quality , because toys linked to TV shows and characters limit children 's creativity and confine their play to familiar scripts . Commercial kids ' TV gets knocked all the time , and many of the knocks are legitimate . But not this one . I 'm not even sure where the criticism came from , but my sleuthing led me to Diane Levin , a professor of education based in Boston and the author of Teaching Young Children in Violent Times . While Levin 's main issue is war toys , her statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have become an unchallenged truth that other commentators have applied much more broadly . The implication is that when kids play Bob the Builder or pull out their Caillou dolls , their every move is defined  --  and confined  --  by the toy 's pre-existing character and the TV show it 's based on . I do n't buy it . I do n't believe children park their imaginations when they pick up a toy based on a TV character . Nor do I believe that scripts are anything particularly new in children 's play , nor that scripted play is inherently bad . Since advances in brain research have shown us the importance of play in children 's development , there 's a temptation to want to manage play . As adults , we cling to a vision of ideal play as creative and spontaneous , totally independent of prefab props or borrowed characters . In reality , I think scripted play has been around as long as stories have . Personally , I remember " scripted " play that was a lot of fun . My friend Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could n't find enough people for a road hockey game , would spice up the proceedings with scenarios based on players and teams we 'd seen on TV . But our script was always slightly bent . In our favourite twist , an unheralded defenceman named Bob Wall would score all the goals  --  25 in one game . We thought this was hilarious . Since becoming a parent , I 've had the privilege of watching a lot of imaginative play , some of it based on TV characters or situations , some of it more " organic . " I see little difference . Children borrow ideas , extend them , combine them with others and make up new ones . The many action figures in our toy box assumed numerous identities over the years . In fact , dollar-for-dollar and hour-for-hour , the Ray Stantz figure ( from Ghostbusters ) and Magneto ( from X-Men ) provided some of the best play value of any we purchased  --  more , I have to say , than the lovely wooden Brio train set we so wanted our kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wring their hands over scripted play , the real issue is that they have a hate on for TV and it galls them that children like the characters and want ( and enjoy ) TV-marketed toys . I understand that . I also think adults have to be careful not to inflict too many of their personal prejudices on children 's play . There are lots of problems associated with children and TV , but let 's concentrate on the real ones  --  like making sure kids are active enough , and ensuring they get to spend time engaged in other , less-commercial , childhood pursuits . If children watch TV , and they do , influences like Dragon Ball Z , Scooby Doo or Sabrina the Teenage Witch will pop up in their play . I concede that not all of those influences will be wonderful . ( Neither were some of the rhymes , born of the hallowed oral tradition , that my friends and I used to chant . ) But it does n't justify a knee-jerk dismissal of all TV-influenced play . I like to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
