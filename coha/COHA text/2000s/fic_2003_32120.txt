Chapter One Once upon a time a young princess became angry with her father , the King . The King had required her obedience to clean her room , but she had countless servants . Why should she pick up after herself ? " I know what I 'll do , " the princess said to herself . " I 'll teach everyone a lesson . I 'll run away from home and leave my room messed up just like this . " She searched through her dresser drawers for old clothing , pitching what she did not want on the floor . Finding the clothing she wanted to dress up in , she disguised herself as one of the village peasant girls . Then , she quietly slipped out of the castle 's secret door . The princess knew her father , the King , would not discover her missing for several hours because he was attending to important business . Walking a short distance , the princess soon found herself in a neighborhood lined with markets and merchants . On a narrow backstreet she met a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " They are having much more fun than I ever have . I 'm tired of being a princess . I shall be like them . " It was n't long before the children asked her to play stickball with them . She was so happy . The princess quickly caught on to their game . She elbowed whoever got in her way ... just like them . She cursed when she missed the ball ... just like them . And when she fell , plop , she fell straight into the mud ... just like them . Suddenly a young girl appeared at the corner of the street . She called to the children , " Come , hurry , something really big is happening on Main Street . " Sticks flew into the air and the children ran toward Main Street . The princess was quite proud of herself for she could run very fast ... just like them . When the children reached Main Street , they reached a crowd of people who were oohing and ahhing over something . The children shoved and pushed their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finely dressed men and women standing at the front of the group . " Go away , you filthy children , " one woman said . Incensed the princess said , " I am no filthy child . I am a prin ... " Her words trailed off . Looking at the children standing around her , she thought to herself , " I used to be a princess . Now I 'm just like them ! " With new resolve she began to elbow her way through the crowd again , purposely getting mud on the hems of the fine dresses and skirts . " It 's no use , " one of the boys finally said , " ' We ca n't get to the front of this crowd . Hurry , let 's go climb that tree over there . " The children hurried to the tree and just like monkeys scurried up to perch on the branches . All the children managed to climb the tree , except for the princess . Trailing behind them she reassured herself , " I can climb this tree ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she pulled her way to the second branch , a small limb caught the threads of her skirt and threw her off balance . Not being able to catch herself , she tumbled out of the tree and fell to the ground with a thump . The adults turned around and peered at her with disgust . The children in the tree laughed and yelled at her , " Get up here , quick . It 's coming , it 's coming . " She did n't know what was coming , nor did she care at this particular moment . Humiliated and bruised from the fall , she wanted to cry . But she was like them and they certainly would n't cry . So , she cursed instead . Determined , the princess finally made her way up the tree and settled insecurely on a lower branch . " What are we looking for anyway ? " she asked . " It 's the King , " yelled the other kids . " Do n't you know a King when you see one , " they sneered at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretched to see the King . An envoy of dignitaries stood beside a lavish coach . When the door opened , out stepped the King . So tall . So dignified . So royal ! " Hail , His Majesty the King , " an aide announced . The crowd responded , " Long live the King . " The dignitaries dropped to one knee . The crowd bowed before him . Only the King was left standing . Then one of the boys in the tree whispered to the group , " Hey , we have a perfect shot from here . Let 's throw our best spitballs right in his face . " Horror struck the princess ' heart . " You ca n't do that , " she pleaded . " Why not ? " the boys demanded . " Because he 's the King , " she said . " So , what . Big deal , " they said as they began to throw spitballs at the King . " Stop , " the princess cried . " Stop please . That 's my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier now spilled down her cheeks . " Sure , and my dad is Abraham , " they mocked her . " No , I mean it . It 's true . The King is my father , " she pleaded . But the children just laughed harder . " Look at you . You 're just like us , " they sneered . " You do n't have a father . " The princess looked at her father just in time to see him wipe something from his face . He looked up into the tree as the children yelled and cursed at him . Indescribable shame filled her heart . She was sure her father had seen her . But maybe , just maybe , he had n't recognized her . The princess jumped out of the tree and began to run . As she did , the children started to throw their spitballs at her . The princess began to run back toward the palace . She ran and ran , sobbing every step of the way . Stopping to catch her breath the princess suddenly became aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bleeding from the fall and she began to cry even harder . Her heart sank and she felt alone and very frightened . Making her way slowly back to the palace she discovered , to her honor , that the secret door was now locked . She ran to the next door , but it was locked too . As was the next and the next door . " Oh , no ! " she cried , " I am locked out and have no place to go . The palace is no longer my home . " The princess knew that only the front door remained-unlocked . " I ca n't possibly use the front door , " she thought , " everyone will know how foolish I have been . Everyone will look at me ... and I look just like them . " So she waited and waited , trying desperately to think of some way to get out of this terrible mess . Finally , too sore and too hungry to think any longer , she gave in and headed for the front door . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she lifted her hand and knocked once , slowly , timidly . Before she could muster the courage to knock again the door cracked open . Hanging her head in shame , she could see only his feet . But she knew instantly that they were his feet . It was him . Her dad . Her father . The King . She fell at his feet and cried , " I 'm sorry Daddy . I am so ashamed of what I have done . " Gently , the King knelt down beside her and pulled her into his strong , comforting arms . " Come here , my child , my princess , " he said . " But I 'm not a princess any more ... I 'm just like them , " she sobbed . " Ah , my child , " he said . " You may have acted like them , but you are not one of them . You are mine , and you will never be happy until you accept both the privilege and responsibility that goes with belonging to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tucked her into her soft bed and kissed her goodnight . He had even helped her to clean the mess she had left in her room . As she settled into the soft quilts , she thought about how much she liked being a princess , the daughter of a King . As the King walked out of the room , the dim night light softly illuminated his royal robe , which was now smudged with dirt . Tears filled the princess ' eyes , " Look what I 've done to the King 's robe . Never again , " she whispered , apologizing to the King . Sensing her broken heart , the King turned and spoke softly , " Yes , my child , there will be other times , but I will open the door every time you knock and I will always love you ... ever , again . " And this story has no end . " Come , you who are blessed by my Father ; take your inheritance , the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
