Daniel Dern taught the first course in science fiction at MIT while he was still a student there-he would rather have taken such a course , but they did not offer one . His short fiction has appeared in Analog , Tomorrow , Worlds of If , and New Dimensions . He writes frequently for the technology trade and has published several books on the Internet . His Website www.dern.com includes a host of interesting things , ranging from an Internet paper airplane to notes on Jewish themes and characters in science fiction . I 've been told that when Philip K. Dick read John Sladek 's parody , " Solar Shoe-salesman , " he was impressed enough to say he wished he 'd written it . I would n't be surprised to learn that Barry Malzberg 's appreciation for this piece is as strong . <p> HIGH OVER NORTHERN NEW Jersey , as big as a college football stadium and shaped in the form of a 1959 Cadillac Fleetwood , the alien craft descended through the autumn early evening . Cunningly it floated down in a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private flights from Teterboro Airport . Evening birds , en route to dumpsters of too-old bagels in the business district , squawked and flew suddenly around the obstacle . It slowed to a halt a hundred feet above the ground , appearing to anyone who happened to look up like a cloud , or fog , or a blur in their vision that made them look elsewhere . Not that , in the suburbs , many looked up . Dozens of doors , windows , ports , hatchways , porches and other egresses irised , scissored , flopped , burst or otherwise opened along the bottoms of giant doors and from the fenders , as well as from the front and back license plates . From these openings streamed out aliens , like candy on a conveyer belt , and floated delicately to the ground . Most looked like pre-teenaged girls in size and shape , except that their appearance , even their arms , and their clothes , made them resemble Russian matrioshka dolls , with smooth skin , nearly flat noses and ears , and brightly colored features . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , short , wide and thin , as if they were collectively like the others , but not individually . As they landed at a street corner , their footwear made soft swooshing sounds , and the pastel colors of their tight-fitting clothes gleamed gently , as if made from the skins of mice genetically enhanced with the firefly 's glow gene . As each group of aliens landed , they began walking , as if the ground were just another set of steps , their footwear continuing to swoosh , swoosh , swoosh . Three abreast , like a column of young Girl Scouts , they marched across the street to a house . One alien pressed the doorbell button . One began to use the door knocker . All others that could began to rap gently on the door , some aliens kneeling to the ground in order to do so . The door opened , revealing a tall , gaunt human draped in shadow by the hallway light behind him , the light from the underpowered bulb above the mailbox , by the upper side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a frame of an animated movie , ready to be converted to a wireframe . " What ? " he said irritably , seeing only the first trio on the step . " It 's late , and we do n't want anything . " He started to close the door , but was swept aside as the aliens streamed into the house , gliding silently rather than walking in their perfectly shined shoes . As if carried by the tide of aliens , he backed up inside the house , through the short hallway and into a room filled with books - bookshelves with groaning planks , short neat stacks , tall unsquared stacks almost visibly swaying , a room so full of books it seemed like they were really three-dimensional wallpaper or an extreme form of stucco , so many that " living room " no longer seemed an appropriate name , that books were the native life form here , and the man , and the aliens , were guests there only by the books " sufferance . " This is inappropriate , " he protested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the back as if performing some literary lumbar massage . " You must leave at once . " The room was full of aliens packed nearly elbow to elbow , like a sea of corn , or a human performance of a computer graphic showing data with height bars made from Girl Scouts . " My daughters are n't home . What is all this ? " In one motion , as if connected , they all sat down . One of the aliens , not quite the tallest , with blank features and a blue diagonal sash , rose slightly and answered , " We have come for your knowledge . " " What am I , Lazarus Long ? " he snapped . " Go . Go . Go . " " We have questions , you will answer . " " This is absurd . Do you think this is some fan convention , that you can just waltz - or in your case , pour in here and question me ? Do you see a registration desk anywhere ? Do I look like I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The alien nearest him stood , and read from a hand-sized object that looked like a plastic artichoke left in an oven to melt . " What are the impacts of Ellison and Spinrad on the philosophic movements of late-twentieth-century philosophers ? Can the popularity of Asimov 's story " Nightfall " be explained by genetic-level encoding or is there some deep semantic structure in the story unrelated to its surface theme which forces readers to respond to it ? What is beyond Apollo ? Can the unauthorized sequels to Heinlein 's juveniles be considered legitimate parts of his oeuvre ? If protagonists from the works of Joanna Russ and John Norman were to fight , who would win ? Which Philip K. Dick novel would make a better musical , The Man in the High Castle or Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? Can Fritz Leiber 's Gummitch and Heinlein 's Pixel be considered as part of one uber-character whose existence is real and external to art , manifesting itself episodically through the medium of authors like these ? Is it possible to replicate the structure of the Pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would following the links imbue a user with the power to walk through Shadow , etc. ? " As if battered , he reeled , nearly knocking over a stack of books , the top ones of which included a collection by Ludwig Bemmelmens , a bound galley of an unreissued Bernard Wolfe collection , and a photo essay on squashes and pumpkins resembling faces , entitled " Microscopic Gourds . " " Back , " he cried out , looking around him for something to seize and hold out to repel questions and questioners . " Be silent ! " Around him , the aliens began to sway , each in their own direction and rhythm . " What is the psycho-historical significance of David Hartwell 's plaid trousers period ? " cried out an alien from the far corner of the room . " Is Westchester County a metaphor for the exploration of Jupiter , Saturn , or other large , unknowable gas giant planets ? " asked another , which had fallen at the man 's feet . " I have eaten everything you have ever written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alien climbing over the shoulders of the aliens in the middle of the room , as if in a reverse mosh pit . " SILENCE ! " roared the human and , as if obeying , the aliens were suddenly quiet . " What do you want ? Who the devil are you ? What makes you think you can come here , uninvited , and intrude on my personal life ? Why do you want to know all these things , and what makes you think I know any of the answers ? " The room was briefly filled with sounds like banquet guests all tapping their spoons on their wineglasses . Then , in one smooth motion , all but one alien sat down in place . The one standing , its upper garment adorned with geometric shapes in various primary colors , spoke : " We want your wisdom . We have read the sacred literature and its many writings of prayer . We have surfed the web sites and read the archives of the groups of discussion . But there is much that is not clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many things alluded to but never discussed , and even more of the primary truths that we can find to buy , yea , not even on eBay . And of that we have read , watched , consumed , there is much we do not understand . We have come , these great distances , in our eight-cylinder engine of the night , seeking truth , seeking but to touch the hem of your garment , one who has communed with the greats , written the deep enduring truths , stared into the abyss which watches back , shaken the hand of Star Fleet Captain James Kirk Poland . We salute you , we praise you , we implore you . Answer us at least our three questions , give us a token , and we shall depart from this shrine happy enough forever . " The adjacent alien continued : " Let us rub the sweat of your brow and thighs across these , our most sacred fabric artifacts . Give us a snapshot of your mind . Let us conjoin one of our replicate universes with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us your mitochondria , that we may sculpt our asteroid belt to encode its patterns . Let us harvest the ammonia from your cat 's litterboxes . Give us one emission of your spermatozoa , which we will embed in amber and distribute as holy objects to be worn in amulets to ward off the evil demons that increasingly invade our atmosphere , to enable our females to again have our full broods of sixteen , to guard our computational devices and space warp drives from the influx of hostile quantum universes . Help us , oh great one ! " A shorter , broomstick-thin alien mini-teleported from the center of the room to the front , and pushed a battered copy of Confessions of Westchester County . " Mr. Malzberg , please , would you autograph this ? " The man turned slightly to look at the third supplicant , and then back to the roomful of aliens all sitting , standing , kneeling , watching him with tense , expectant silence . " Is that who you think I am ? " The aliens all nodded . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am not who you think I am . The one you seek is out , away , off speaking at some symposium where he is receiving an award . You have traveled a great distance and woken me up from what was starting out to be a very pleasant dream , to no purpose . Now : go ! " Picking up a copy of Diary of a Parisian Chambermaid , he waved it at the roomful of aliens , as if trying to disperse the smoke from a burning pot roast . " Away ! Out ! Begone ! " Staring at the man with unreadable expressions , the aliens began to move away , first backing up , then rotating their legs , waists or even entire bodies so that they were walking forward while still looking straight at him . The front door of the house did not open , but the aliens still left , until the last alien disappeared , phased through the door , or otherwise got out , leaving only the non-alien who pushed the book flat against the door , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Above , still shrouded in clouds and mind-fogging emanations , the alien craft throbbed , like cold tapioca , reformed in the shape of a hawk wained with ropes and covered in jellybeans - jellybeans ! - and launched itself toward Los Angeles , by way of Philadelphia , and several provinces in Canada . Back in New Jersey , a voice called down the stairs , " Is somebody there ? " and , as he double-locked the door and pushed the doorchain into its slot , the man called back , " No , no , just a wrong number , " and went back upstairs to bed , to sleep , to dream private dreams .
