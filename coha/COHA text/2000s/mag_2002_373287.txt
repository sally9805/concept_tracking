For the past decade , Hollywood has been desperately trying to pump some testosterone into the lucrative but enervated action genre . With Stallone and Schwarzenegger approaching 60 , the studios have actually taught skinny guys like Keanu Reeves and Tobey Maguire how to fight . They 've even taken the drastic measure of coming up with some really interesting action ideas , like The Matrix . <P> But Hollywood sees an unlikely savior on the horizon : Vin Diesel . Tough , stoic and tawny , with muscles like Adonis and a voice so deep only Bea Arthur can imitate it , Diesel became a star last summer in the surprise street-racing hit The Fast and the Furious . At the moment in Hollywood , Diesel is the very model of the new action hero . <P> Although their parents may not have heard of him , members of the hip-hop generation have embraced Diesel so enthusiastically that his per-picture fee is rapidly rising into the $20 million territory . Teens are so excited about seeing him in XXX , a spy movie opening Aug. 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something besides extreme sports . Like The Rock , whose Scorpion King grossed more than $90 million earlier this year , Diesel is also part of a nascent constellation of stars whose melting-pot backgrounds and features seem to be resonating deeply with young moviegoers of all colors . Hollywood has seen the future of the action hero , and it 's multiethnic . <P> With his exotic looks  --  olive skin and full lips  --  he 's widely assumed to be of Italian and African heritage , but Diesel resolutely refrains from identifying his ethnicity . One Race is the name of his production company , and he refers to himself simply as " multicultural . " " I support the idea of being multicultural primarily for all the invisible kids , the ones who do n't fit into one ethnic category and then find themselves lost in some limbo , " says Diesel , 35 , as he dips into a bowl of hummus on the patio of Los Angeles ' gothic Chateau Marmont hotel . <P> In XXX  --  a high-camp , high-concept , highly stylized adrenaline rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ripped and tattooed un-James Bond . Like Diesel himself , who admits that when he was a child his " appetite for attention was insatiable , " Xander is a self-starting , self-promoting charmer who is presumably unfit for any occupation other than star . Obsessed with dangerous exploits that require extreme athleticism , Xander sells black-market films of himself performing such stunts as stealing the Corvette of a right-wing Senator , driving it off a cliff and parachuting to safety . He 's recruited by a U.S. security official ( a scar-faced Samuel L. Jackson ) to save the world from an East European anarchist . <P> In preview screenings , men cheer the stunts ( see Vin outpace an avalanche on a snowboard ! ) while young women whoop and holler every time Diesel reveals his tattooed chest  --  which is frequently . The film explicitly sets up Diesel as the new postmodern Bond by killing off a nameless spy wearing a tux in the first scene . A sequel is already in the works .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
