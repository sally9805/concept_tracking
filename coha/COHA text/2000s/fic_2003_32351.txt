THE FUTURE OF THE SERVICE " United States Deputy Marshal Sittell to see Captain MacNeal of the Texas Rangers . " I spoke with more force than politeness , and I flashed my shield at the block-headed attendant who had denied me admittance to the adjutant general 's office . In Texas , where nearly every man was such a giant that he had to lower his head to enter a door , it was exasperating to be only five feet six . As my business was to impress a class of men exceedingly hard to impress , and as I , despite my size , had some little reason for pride , I was naturally nettled by the manner of the attendant . Mildness of disposition was not one of my strong characteristics . " Marshal Sittell , excuse me ! " the attendant quickly replied with a vast change of demeanor that somewhat assuaged my wounded vanity . He led me into an anteroom from which I could see into Adjutant General Weed 's office . Motioning me to a chair , he passed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from within . Directly the attendant returned and now approached me with a show of respect . " Captain MacNeal will see you presently . He is about to leave an interview with Adjutant General Weed and Governor Stone . You are to listen , hear what you can . " Then he went out , closing the door behind him . I sat down , decidedly interested . There was something in the wind . Captain MacNeal 's summons had been urgent , much in the nature of an appeal . I had been one of his rangers for three yearsbefore my service had earned me a higher post . Our relationship had been something more than that of ranger to captain , and my respect and admiration for him were great . Since MacNeal had been leader of the rangers , he had not only been fighting the horde of outlaws , west of the Colorado , but a political faction at Austin that opposed the ranger system . MacNeal had so far accomplished wonders , making sections of that wild and vast Southwest habitable for pioneers and ranchmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task in the accomplishment of which he hoped to enlist my aid . The door to the inner office was open and I overheard the earnest voice of the adjutant general , whom I knew . " Governor Stone , this is Captain MacNeal of the Texas Rangers . " Both men courteously acknowledged the introduction , and the governor said that , of course , he was familiar with MacNeal 's splendid record , won during the Rebellion . " And Captain MacNeal , " he added , " I shall be pleased to hear what you have to say . " " Governor Stone , " replied MacNeal earnestly , " I sought this interview to try to show you what a great ... a fatal error it would be now to discontinue the ranger service . I have no axe to grind . I 'm independent of salary , and I 'm not seeking anything for myself . I love the great Lone Star state . Although I am doing a great deal , I want to do something more for it . " When I heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credited the rumor . But , now that there seems reason to believe it , I am here to place my case and make a fight . Governor Stone , I want to ask bluntly ... do you know anything about the ranger system ... about the rangers ? You are from eastern Texas . We need n't beat about the bush . It 's well known that between east and west Texas there 's differences of opinion ... political and otherwise . Eastern Texas has no need of a ranger service . But as for the western ... the wild Panhandle , the Staked Plains , the Rio Grande ... that 's a different matter . Will you be kind enough to give me your idea of the Texas Rangers ? " That certainly was blunt . It brought back to me strong recollections of MacNeal 's personality . He was a man . I warmed to his side of what I sensed might be more than an argument . " Captain MacNeal , since you ask me directly , you are welcome to my opinion , " replied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rangers . But I 've been told by good authorities that as a whole they are a lot of swashbuckling adventurers and gunfighters , looking for somebody to kill . The sentiment in certain parts of the state makes heroes out of them , a fact which they are not slow to take advantage of . They have too much power . They are too much a law unto themselves . The sheriffs ought to be able to cope with any lawless element in western Texas , as they do in the eastern part of the state . There is a bill pending in the legislature now for the abolishment of this ranger service , and unless very strong evidence is put before me ... great enough to change my mind ... I shall sign the bill . " " Thank you for plain speaking , " replied MacNeal , and the tone of his voice told me how cool and tense he could be when feeling anger or resentment . " You will remember , Governor , that the original bill provided for a ranger service operating only west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the conditions in the remote and wild sections of the border , it is time you were availing yourself of reports sent monthly to Adjutant General Weed . " I have this to say , pointblank . Sheriffs can not deal with the situation as it stands today . There 's a horde of criminals along the Rio Grande . I have a record of three thousand . The Panhandle and Staked Plains are also overrun by outlaws and Desperadoes . There are honest communities ... towns ... whole counties under the dominance of clever , unscrupulous rustlers . A band of militia could not clean up these places . If it is to be done , the rangers must do it . As to my men ... well , some of them are gunfighters . I have tried to find that class of men . I have rangers who have been outlaws . A reformed outlaw who has been a famous gunfighter makes the best kind of ranger . His fame is as much help as his actual work . " You will not understand this , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border . I think a careful study of the reports sent in by my rangers will open the eyes of any unprejudiced person . " " Let us see one of these reports , " suggested the governor . " Adjutant , get that last one of Vaughn Steele 's I sent in . It 's a case in point , and , besides , I 'll have something else to say about Steele . " I heard the opening of a drawer and rustling of papers . " Here it is . Steele certainly does things . You can see that by what he leaves out in his report , " replied the adjutant general . " Read it to me , " said Governor Stone . " Please take note that this is the report of one ranger 's work for one month , " put in Captain MacNeal . The adjutant began by naming the town of Del Rio , where evidently the report had been written , and the date ; then , after a pause , he read : El Paso to Valentine to Del Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sheriff guarded them till his return . To Ensign . Called by attack of schoolteacher . School house burned in fight . No arrests . Brought teacher to Del Rio . Prevented lynching of Negro . Arrested sheriff in getting Negro to safe place . Traced down rumor of Mexican raiders operating on this side border . Unfounded . Arrested white man named Jinks with boatload of stolen goods . Chased the outlaw , Mott , across into Mexico . Killed my horse . No arrest . Assisted rancher . Found bunch of cattle hidden in brush along river . Enlisted cowboys . Drove herd to owner . Nursed maltreated Mexican . Got him home over river . Arrested four Negroes for attacking him . Shot two ... not fatally . Called to Ensign . No arrest . To Del Rio . Arrested rioters in gambler 's resort . Chased them with posse . No arrests . To Ensign , to Cargo , to Junction , to Del Rio after the outlaw and murderer ... Chick Owens . Was shot making arrest . Jail torn down by Owen 's pals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " There ! That 's quite sufficient , " interrupted Governor Stone . " I do n't want to hear any bloody details . " " The half is not told here , " said Captain MacNeal . " But I can read between the lines . This ranger rode seven hundred miles last month . He simply states ... To El Paso , to Valentine , to Del Rio , et cetera . But that means the hardest kind of riding over desert country . He merely states he was wounded twice . No particulars . He ... " " I gather the report must have been a chronicle of a most remarkable month 's work . But is it ... er ... true ? " For a moment , following the governor 's cold question , there was silence in the other room . " Governor Stone , I believe you can rely on these reports , " replied the adjutant . " He must be an able fellow . Where is he now ? " Here I pricked up my ears and listened a little harder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like every other outdoor man in western Texas , had heard all about him . Some of Steele 's jobs had given me jealous qualms , yet thrilled me through and through . I have just sent Steele upon the most difficult and , perhaps , dangerous service he ever undertook . Certainly it is the most important one . It is one I would have undertaken myself , had I had the confidence and ability needed . " " What is the service ? " inquired the governor . " Have you ever heard of Fairdale , Pecos County ? " " Let me see ... Fairdale ? Why , yes , indeed , I 've read things in the papers . Somebody has spoken to me about Fairdale . A remote town or settlement , rich but exceedingly lawless . " " Lawless ! " Captain MacNeal uttered a short , grim laugh . " Fairdale is far to the southwest . I 've never been there . It 's a good-sized town , located west of the Pecos River . Pecos County is merely a name for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich , well-watered valley , and the ranchers are prosperous in spite of the raiders . " For a year now , from time to time , I 've been receiving anonymous letters . They are from persons afraid to sign names ... persons whose friends and families have been robbed , assaulted , murdered . In every case I was importuned to send a company of rangers there , I sent an unknown ranger to make an investigation ... to be careful and secret ... and to return with a report . " He did so . Used as I am to reports of lawlessness , this one amazed me . All the deviltry common to the border goes on there by day and night . More than that , and more interesting , was the ranger 's report that Fairdale must be a center for the most secret , powerful , mysterious , and dangerous band of criminals operating in the Southwest . I decided to send Steele there , to ferret out this lawless gang and break it up . " " Sir , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a job as that ? " queried the governor incredulously . " I expect to send him another ranger ... that 's all , " replied MacNeal . " But , man alive , it 's absurd ! What you ought to send is a company of militia ! " " That would entail great expense , and that is what this new legislative bill is aiming to cut down , is n't it ? " " That is the aim ... yes . " " Well , anyway , soldiers would be powerless , even if you did send them . So also would a whole company of rangers . What this job needs is a couple of keen , resourceful , implacable , dangerous men ! " " But how can they ... alone ... break up a powerful gang of ruffians ? " " Perhaps they 're not all ruffians . I 've known respected and intelligent citizens to be mixed up in shady deals . I have detailed Steele to go to Fairdale , openly as a ranger , and to begin work . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not killed , they will clean up the town . My men have made more than one town safe for the decent people to live in . Of course , not such places as Fairdale , but bad enough to show their capacity for dangerous work . " " Captain , your confidence is beyond me , " commented the governor . " Frankly , this is the most extraordinary undertaking I 've ever heard of . " " If you knew the ranger , it would n't seem so strange , " went on Captain MacNeal . " I expect , of course , to lend them every assistance possible . Steele asked for a nervy and clever man to be sent to Fairdale as a secret aid . I 've had the man in mind , and he 's now waiting outside . " " Another ranger ? " " No , not now . Formerly he was with my service . But at present he is a special officer , United States deputy marshal . " " Call him in , " said the governor . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His greeting made me believe he sided with MacNeal in this matter . I went with him . MacNeal seemed the same slim , erect , and soldierly officer I remembered so well , and his dark face surely expressed welcome and pleasure at sight of me . We shook hands as we greeted each other . Then Adjutant General Weed introduced me to the governor . I saw a tall , pale man with a pointed beard and an aristocratic bearing that reminded me of a rich Louisiana planter . The way the governor looked me over with his cold , blue eyes was not especially to my liking . He did not offer his hand , though from habit I had made a move to extend mine . " Does the ... er ... the marshal know yet of the dangerous mission upon which you would send him ? " asked Governor Stone of MacNeal . " I heard your conversation , " I replied bluntly . " Will you care to accept Captain MacNeal 's proposition ? " " I 'll be glad to go . Adjutant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You , of course , appreciate the danger of this work ? " queried the governor . " The more the danger , the better I 'll like it , " I rejoined . My tongue sometimes was swifter than it ought to have been , and I had a hankering for the governor to take me for one of those swashbucklers that had so disgusted him . " Do you know this Ranger Steele ? " " Only by reputation . " " And what is that reputation ? " " Steele 's known on the border from El Paso to the mouth of the Rio Grande . He is feared . " " Do you entertain any conviction of his success in this service ? " " He 'll clean up Fairdale . " I put it strongly , without a shadow of doubt . I was eager to help MacNeal 's argument . " Ah ! Indeed ! You seem to share the captain 's confidence . I see you wear a gun there , under your coat . How is that ... carrying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack a gun . Any minute I might run into men . " " Men you want to arrest , I presume ? " " No . Men who are hankering to kill me ! " " Indeed ? May I ask what for ? " " Because I did arrest them once , and now that one thing or another ... perhaps political influence ... has helped them out of jail , they 'll be looking for me . " Plain it was that Governor Stone was impressed with me , but scarcely favorably . " No doubt you 've had victims ... er ... you 've killed men ? " " Only a few . I never counted . " That sickened the aristocratic governor from eastern Texas , and he turned to the others . " Gentlemen , manifestly the United States deputy marshal will be an able lieutenant for Ranger Steele . " He turned his face to MacNeal . " Have you anything further to say to me about the matter ? " " Only this , Governor Stone , " replied MacNeal quickly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wait till Steele has succeeded or failed in his attempt to make Fairdale a law-abiding town ? I shall find means to furnish you with authentic details of his work . Will you hold off signing this bill for a while ? " " Captain MacNeal , that is a most fair and reasonable request , " replied the governor with some warmth . " If you are satisfied to make this a test of the ranger service , I shall be glad to wait , even a year or more . I remind you , I am open to conviction . You have made some remarkable statements in regard to your rangers . For the welfare of Texas I hope and pray they are true . " Governor Stone bowed to the captain , then to me , and in company with the adjutant general he left the office . When Captain MacNeal turned to me he was white , and his jaw was working . " Russ ! " he exclaimed passionately , calling me by the familiar name once common among my ranger comrades , " Russ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaughn Steele ! "
