I Know This Much Is True A Novel Chapter One On the afternoon of October 12 , 1990 , my twin brother Thomas entered the Three Rivers , Connecticut Public Library , retreated to one of the rear study carrels , and prayed to God the sacrifice he was about to commit would be deemed acceptable . Mrs. Theresa Fenneck , the children 's librarian , was officially in charge that day because the head librarian was at an all-day meeting in Hartford . She approached my brother and told him he 'd have to keep his voice down or else leave the library . She could hear him all the way up at the front desk . There were other patrons to consider . If he wanted to pray , she told him , he should go to a church , not the library . Thomas and I had spent several hours together the day before . Our Sunday afternoon ritual dictated that I sign him out of the state hospital 's Settle Building , treat him to lunch , visit our stepfather or take him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before suppertime . At a back booth at Friendly 's , I 'd sat across from my brother , breathing in his secondary smoke and leafing for the umpteenth time through his scrapbook of clippings on the Persian Gulf crisis . He 'd been collecting them since August as evidence that Armageddon was at hand -- that the final battle between good and evil was about to be triggered . " America 's been living on borrowed time all these years , Dominick , " he told me . " Playing the world 's whore , wallowing in our greed . Now we 're going to pay the price . " He was oblivious of my drumming fingers on the tabletop . " Not to change the subject , " I said , " but how 's the coffee business ? " Ever since eight milligrams of Haldol per day had quieted Thomas 's voices , he had managed a small morning concession in the patients ' lounge -- coffee and cigarettes and newspapers dispensed from a metal cart more rickety than his emotional state . Like so many of the patients there , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers that had become Thomas 's most potent addiction . " How can we kill people for the sake of cheap oil ? How can we justify that ? " His hands flapped as he talked ; his palms were grimy from newsprint ink . Those dirty hands should have warned me -- should have tipped me off . " How are we going to prevent God 's vengeance if we have that little respect for human life ? " Our waitress approached -- a high school kid wearing two buttons : " Hi , I 'm Kristin " and " Patience , please . I 'm a trainee . " She asked us if we wanted to start out with some cheese sticks or a bowl of soup . " You ca n't worship both God and money , Kristin , " Thomas told her . " America 's going to vomit up its own blood . " About a month later  --  after President Bush had declared that " a line has been drawn in the sand " and conflict might be inevitable  --  Mrs. Fenneck showed up at my front door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived via the city directory , then ridden out of the blue to Joy 's and my condo and rung the bell .

" Your brother was always neat and clean , " she told me . " You ca n't say that about all of them . But you have to be firm with these people . All day long , day in , day out , the state hospital van just drops them downtown and leaves them . They have nowhere to go , nothing to do . The stores do n't want them  --  business is bad enough , for pity 's sake . So they come to the library and sit . " Her pale green eyes jerked repeatedly away from my face as she spoke . Thomas and I are identical twins , not fraternal -- one fertilized egg that split in half and went off in two directions . Mrs. Fenneck could n't look at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I remember , and I invited her into the foyer , no further . For two weeks I 'd been channel-flipping through the Desert Shield updates , swallowing back the anger and guilt my brother 's act had left me with , and hanging up in the ears of reporters and TV types  --  all those bloodsuckers trying to book and bag next week 's freak show . I did n't offer to take Mrs. Fenneck 's coat . I stood there , arms crossed , fists tucked into my armpits . Whatever this was , I needed it to be over . She said she wanted me to understand what librarians put up with these days . Once upon a time it had been a pleasant job -- she liked people , after all . But now libraries were at the mercy of every derelict and homeless person in the area . People who cared nothing about books or information . People who only wanted to sit and vegetate or run to the toilet every five minutes . And now with AIDS and drugs and such . The other day they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispenser in the men 's restroom .

" I asked her . " Why did you come here ? " She 'd come , she said , because she had n't had any appetite or a decent night 's sleep since my brother did it . Not that she was responsible , she pointed out . Clearly , Thomas had planned the whole thing in advance and would have done it whether she 'd said anything to him or not . A dozen people or more had told her they 'd seen him walking around town , muttering about the war with that one fist of his up in the air , as if it was stuck in that position .
