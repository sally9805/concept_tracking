<p> Where 's Shirley Dean ? <p> The former Berkeley mayor who lost her re-election bid to Tom Bates now looks a lot better to some citizens who had voted against her just for a change . Bates ' political stock plummeted last week , a month after the Nov. 5 election , when he admitted the pre-election theft of campus newspapers that had endorsed Dean . <p> But Dean , 68 , has remained largely on the sidelines in the uproar , leaving the city 's turbulent political landscape clouded by the question : Will she come out of her tent to lead the anger against the new mayor ? <p> Bates , 64 , has refused demands that he resign , but he moved last week to control the damage by agreeing to plead guilty to an infraction , pay restitution to the Daily Californian , speak to public school classes and sponsor a law making it clear that the theft of free papers is a crime . <p> " I 'm waiting to see what the facts tell me , " Dean said in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UC Berkeley police report on the theft and intends to request an explanation from the Alameda County district attorney 's office of why Bates was charged with just an infraction , which Dean characterized as " a slap on the wrist . " <p> While some Dean supporters have urged her to join the fray , others believe her entry would look like sour grapes or political opportunism . <p> For now , she 's devoting herself to two tasks  --  cleaning her house and writing a book , one that she described " as a tell-all book , but it will also be about cities , how cities grow and how they tackle issues . " <p> The book in part will be a record of her legacy , which extends beyond her having been probably the shortest mayor  --  standing 4 feet , 11 inches  --  in Berkeley 's long , colorful history . <p> When elected to her first term in 1994 , she inherited a famous city fallen on hard times and resembling a giant version of the many homeless who lined its sidewalks . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean enjoys a kind of Napoleonic stature in the eyes of her fans . Her base is the city 's so-called " moderate " liberals , who have long been at odds with the further-left " progressives " allied with Bates . <p> The dominant mood in the Dean camp at the moment seems focused on assessing and appreciating what she has done for the city  --  not on a return from political exile to the current battle . <p> Her farewell council meeting on Nov. 19 featured an hourlong tribute that piled her desk with flowers , filled the chambers with standing ovations and swelled her eyes with tears . <p> The achievement mentioned most often in Dean 's legacy is the downtown arts district , a cluster of theaters , music clubs and cafes anchored by an expanded Berkeley Repertory Theater on Addison Street . <p> The arts district won this year 's grand prize for economic development from the California Association for Local Economic Development , and the Bay Area Critics Circle gave its Paine Knickerbocker Award this year to " the City of Berkeley and Mayor Shirley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dean 's administration also saw the completion of the highly regarded pedestrian bridge over Interstate 80 , major expansion of the Art Deco public library and addition of much-valued sports fields and a skateboard park along Harrison Street . <p> Her image was less flattering among her opponents , some of whom accused her of being vindictive and taking credit for their initiatives . <p> And some Bates supporters say Dean is not at liberty to throw stones in the newspaper dispute because of an alleged peccadillo in her own past  --  a 1997 visit to an Ohio college library to dig up information on the student days of her political adversary , City Councilman Kriss Worthington . <p> Dean said the visit was distorted by the Bates campaign and is irrelevant to Bates ' theft of papers . She said accusations that she looked into secret files , posed as Worthington 's aunt and gave a false ID are wrong , and that she merely looked at public copies of a campus paper . " I would say stealing newspapers is a lot more serious than asking about somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the college librarian , Dean 's husband said he was Worthington 's uncle and wrote " genealogy " as the visit 's purpose . Dean said she does not recall her husband claiming to be an uncle . She said she showed her driver 's license and that her husband wrote " genealogy " because that was the reason given by other visitors on the log . <p> One reason she lost the race to Bates appeared to be some voters holding her at least partly responsible for the partisan infighting on the council , though observers noted also that no Berkeley mayor has served more than two terms . ( Dean served two four-year terms . ) <p> Not at issue was her hard work and commitment to the $37,524-a-year job . In fact , many constituents seemed moved more by her tireless responsiveness to individual or neighborhood problems than by what she built . <p> She listed her home phone in the phone book , and her days often began at 7 a.m. and went to midnight . <p> When residents complained about crime and drug-dealing centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in several agencies and built a case to have it closed . Many recalled her visits to local churches , community centers and schools , and her inviting school kids to her office to show them what a mayor does . <p> " You made the Energizer Bunny look like a wimp , " resident Jim Smith told her during the tribute at her final council meeting . <p> Did she get any sleep the past eight years ? <p> " Five to six hours  --  that 's enough for anybody , " Dean said in an interview amid stacks of about 100 boxes of packed files at her office , which she left Dec. 1 . <p> Also key to her accomplishments has been her husband , Dan Dean , a retired counselor from Berkeley High , who drove the mayor from meeting to meeting , found parking and usually observed from the back of the room . " There 's no way I could do any of what I 've done without Dan , " she said . <p> One Dean confidant said he even helped with the cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but he 's a terrible cook . . . . We 've learned what places are open late at night where you can get dinner . " <p> Dean acknowledged that her earlier career as a social worker and experience as a Berkeley neighborhood activist could well have fed her unusual devotion to public service . <p> She was born in Eaton , Colo. , and spent her earliest years on a sheep ranch there . Her family moved to Berkeley , where she attended elementary school and entered Cal at age 16 , graduating in 1956 with a degree in social welfare that led to nearly nine years as a social worker for Kaiser Hospital . <p> She also raised two sons and worked at the Cal admissions office , where she wrote outreach plans for disadvantaged minorities . <p> Dean got her start in politics in 1968 by helping to found the Bonita-Berryman Neighborhood Association during a preservation battle against a developer who sought to tear down houses . <p> She was elected to the politically divided council in 1975 , and lost a bid for mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's three socialist mayors at the time . She won re-election to the council in 1986 . <p> One of her biggest laments has been the council 's partisan battles . As contentious meetings ran close to midnight , her expressions sometimes had an " How did I get into this asylum ? " look . But what really upset her was being called right-wing and compared to Newt Gingrich . <p> " In any other place in the United States , I 'd be regarded as an out-and-out radical , " she said , " and here they call me a conservative . It has always rankled . " <p> Dean said she has not ruled out a return to politics . " There are certain offices people have urged me to run for , " she said , declining to elaborate . " I do n't believe in retirement . " <p> E-mail Charles Burress at **25;3369;TOOLONG
