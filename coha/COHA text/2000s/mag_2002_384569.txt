Foolproof ways to relax , renew , and recharge Photograph // When times are tense , when I 'm brittle with anxiety , I get into bed with a cup of green tea . I pull up the covers and read adventure books set in the Himalayas or Antarctica , books about survival , about brave men on q quest freezing their digits off , their nostrils clogged with the soggy deer hair used in making pre-miracle-fiber anoraks . I snuggle up , warm and toasty , knowing my toes will never turn black . I 'll read Jon Krakauer 's Everest account , Into Thin Air , or Alfred Lansing 's Endurance . I 'll read about Roald Amundsen or Admiral Robert Edwin Peary . Lives are on the line , but here I am , safe under heavy blankets with my hot green tea . Reading these particular books plunges me into an alternate reality . I lose myself in against-all-odds exploration , and the present disappears . But before I can lose myself , I have to find the one thing women rarely have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time alone . Time to nurture myself . But let 's say you can steal some time : Why do so many women find it hard to justify nurturing themselves ? Why do they seem to need permission ? Is it because women are so used to nurturing everybody else ? Perhaps you 're someone who needs that permission to be good to you . If you are , consider this : If it 's true that a family is only as happy as the mother , making ourselves feel better is n't selfish-it 's an obligation . How can we reassure the people we love if we 're edgy and overwrought ? Before we can take care of our family 's emotional needs , we must be strong ourselves . How then to recharge ? There 's no universal way . One woman 's yoga class is another woman 's gardening . What 's important is tuning in to what gives you peace . Bed and a book work for me . But oddly , so does the very opposite : rigorous exercise . It 's impossible to worry while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't gnaw your fingernails and ratchet up the incline of a treadmill . When I go for a swim in the ocean or a pool , it is always September 10 . I do n't swim for speed , I swim for the allconsuming pleasure of clean cleaving through the water , the beauty of the stroke , hands perfectly cupped the way a competitive swimmer once showed me . I swim for the sublimity of floating . Buoyancy buoys my spirits . This is the magic of exercise : As your body relaxes , your mind sharpens . For many of us , a dependable destressor is nature . Regardless of the weather , I walk in my local park every day . And every walk is different . Depending on the time of year , there 's wild columbine or waves of Kippenberg asters . Cherry blossoms or chartreuse ginkgo fans paving black cinders . Surrounded by such outrageous beauty , I am , quite simply , renewed . And here 's what 's amazing : A problem never looks exactly the same when you come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read . Something happens-not to the problem , but to you . Your perspective is new . Your level of intensity changes . Dr. Oliver Sacks , the neurologist and author , says that as a child he found relief from not being able to control his circumstances by immersing himself in the periodic table- " a world of clarity and order and predictability . " What Sacks knew then is important to us now . Order and routine are the enemies of chaos . Luckily for humanity , routine prevails . Even today , as we learn to live with a low-level anxiety that waxes and wanes , daily life imposes order . You have to get up . You have to make breakfast . You have to bring in the paper and let out the dog . Humble , routine acts reassure because they shout normalcy . They say things have n't changed that much . And when we begin to worry that they have , we must take whatever chunk of time is necessary to restore ourselves . Read a book . Let the drama of other lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some iron . Do 50 perfect sit-ups or bake your grandmother 's mile-high coconut cake . Look out the window and dream . Life ca n't get any more ordinary than that , can it ? Or any more comforting either . Finding peace of mind Photograph " I 'm rereading Jane Austen . " // GH readers share their feel-better ideas I 've stopped waiting for the house to look better " and started inviting friends over . I 'm ironing more : Normally to be avoided at all costs , it 's now deeply satisfying . Spray , steam , press ... I love watching my hard work make the wrinkles disappear . Order restored . After September 11 , I went out and bought toys-a paddleball , a Slinky , Silly Putty ... all things that remind me of the safety I felt as a child . My kids and I find that spending more time together , doing simple things with one another , helps us cope . This means going to church more often as a family , and putting aside our petty differences to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been letting the cat sleep with me , even if it means getting up to let her out at 4:00 A.M. We turn off the TV ( my husband does so reluctantly ! ) and listen to classical music . I 'm learning calligraphy . The practice required is very repetitive , which helps me focus on something besides the TV news . I love spending an afternoon at the zoo with my daughter and 12-month-old grandson . We find peace in all the beautiful animals God created . Instead of CNN , I 'm watching Animal Planet .
