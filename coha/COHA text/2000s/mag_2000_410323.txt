On your next trip , take a detour to see some great American roadside art . Photograph You can see the work of Fred Smith ( bottom , circa 1962 ) for free at the Wisconsin Concrete Park , but donations are gladly accepted . // QUICK QUIZ : WHAT 'S THE BEST-KNOWN work of art in America ? Here 's a hint : It 's not in a museum , it 's nowhere near any of the major metropolitan art scenes , and it 's a prime travel destination . + The answer is Mount Rushmore , which is obvious once you stop and think about it . The reason you may have to think about it , of course , is that very few of us conceive of Mount Rushmore as artwork . Part of this is due to Rushmore 's entrenched status as a national memorial , but I think it 's also because many of us have accepted the notion that art exists only in museums and galleries . But that 's not the case , and nothing demonstrates this better than roadside art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a great stop on any trip . The massive Rushmore is admittedly an extreme example , but there are a lot of more down-toearth roadside specimens situated along our nation 's highways , waiting to be stumbled upon while you 're heading from here to there . Roadside art often is n't as polished as museum pieces , but it 's nonetheless brimming with the inspiration and revelation that have always informed the best artwork . And in a nice twist , roadside art is frequently made by people who did n't even consider themselves artists until they began their projects . A great example is Carhenge ( U.S. Highway 385 , just north of Alhance , Neb. ; 308-762-1520 ; free ) , a spectacular Stonehenge-patterned auto sculpture that I encountered a few years ago while driving through the barren Nebraska flatlands ( see " Right out in the Open , ' November 1998 ) . It was built in the mid1980s after a fellow named Jim Reinder got the idea during a family reunion . Initially ridiculed , Carhenge is now an acknowledged American treasure . Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited over the years . All of them qualify as destinations in their own right , but you may prefer to make them a detour on a longer trip ; the box below has information on which sites are near major driving routes to more conventional destinations . Some are free of charge , but go ahead and leave a donation-you 'll be helping to defray the costs of upkeep and maintenance , and you 'll get to feel like a genuine patron of the arts . Cadillac Ranch ( I-40 , about six miles west of Amarillo , Texas ; 806-374-1497 ; **37;1108;TOOLONG . html ; free ) . Another fantastic car sculpture , this one consisting of 10 vintage Cadillacs half-buried nosedown in the ground , their protruding tail fins documenting the Caddy 's design evolution from 1949 through 1964 . Created in 1974 by a San Francisco art collective called the Ant Farm and situated in a wheatfield owned by the eccentric Amarillo helium magnate Stanley Marsh III , Cadillac Ranch is a playful tribute to the open road .

About the only thing you ca n't do is steal the wheels and hubcaps , which have all been welded in place . Wisconsin Concrete Park ( Route 13 , Phillips , Wis. ; 800-269-4505 ; outsider.art . Org/fred ; free ) . Fred Smith , a retired logger with no art training , did n't plan on becoming a sculptor at the age of 62it just sort of poured out of him . Working primarily in concrete decorated with colorful pieces of broken glass and mirrors , he made more than 200 large , festive sculptures between 1948 and 1964 , most of them depicting animals , scenes of small-town life and American icons like Paul Bunyan , Sacagawea , Abe Lincoln and the Statue of Liberty . His work has a wonderfully childlike sense of accidental genius , much like the more celebrated folk art of Howard Finster ( who has his own roadside sculpture park , Paradise Gardens , Summerville , Ga. ; 800346-7837 ; www.finster.com ) . Smith died in 1976 , but placards with some of his more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in ya to do it ! " are scattered around the small park where his work is now displayed . The site is maintained by Price County , making it one of America 's most inspired examples of publicly administered art . Grotto of the Redemption ( 300 N. Broadway , West Bend , Iowa ; 515-887-2371 ; **32;1147;TOOLONG ; $5 ) . Grottoes are among the most stunning roadside artworks . There are several beautiful examples , but the biggest and best is clearly the magnificent Grotto of the Redemption . The sprawling , rocky shrine , with its winding stairways , balconies , statues and mosaics , is studded with countless crystals and gemstones ( its estimated geological value is over $2.5 million ) , creating the sense of a huge , glittering sand castle-truly a place that has to be seen to be believed . It 's also an obsessive labor of love : The project , which has never had a blueprint , was launched in 1912 by Paul Dobberstein , a Catholic priest who worked on it tirelessly- often hauling gems from hundreds of miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued the work into the 1990s . Today the Grotto , still managed by Dobberstein 's diocese , is a popular destination for religious and secular travelers alike , with guided tours available . Tinkertown ( Route 536 , Sandia Park , N.M. ; 505-281-5233 ; www.tinkertown . Com ; $3 ) . Essentially a folk art collection inside a gigantic folk art sculpture , Tinkertown is an utterly charmin-dng and seemingly endless assortment of homemade figurines and dioramas , many of them mechanized , depicting scenes of circuses and the Old West , plus lots of little mini-sculptures just about everywhere you look . The overall effect is like a penny arcade mixed with a carnival , and the whole thing is housed in a bizarre structure made in part from old glass bottles and bicycle wheels . Tinker  --  towns incredible torrent of good cheer flows from Ross and Clara Ward , who 've been working on the facility for more than 40 years and whose motto aptly sums up the spirit of roadside art : " We did all this while you were watching TV !
