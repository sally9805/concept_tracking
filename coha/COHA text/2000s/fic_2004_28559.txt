Chapter One Adam Lassiter 's frown came fast and hard when he got his first good look at Glory Ridge Resort and Campground in the bright light of an Arizona summer day . " Do you mean to tell me , " he said to the woman standing beside him , " that people actually pay to stay at this place ? " Jane Pitt stiffened , both at the words and the dryas-dust tone , but managed not to answer in the same vein . She knew that giving as good as she got - normally her first response to any sort of confrontation - would n't serve her best interests at the moment . However she might privately feel about slick business consultants who probably thought that slaving in a ritzy office was real work , she could put up with one if she had to . And this one was slick as spit . Fancy gray suit , fancy red tie , fancy black leather wing tips . Every long , lean inch of him shouted pricey . " No one has paid to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shoved her hands into the pockets of well-worn jeans and flicked her wheat-colored bangs aside with a shake of her head , reminding herself it was time to get the scissors out and whack some off . " That 's why I 'm open to advice for changing the situation . " " Free advice , " her companion pointed out in his low baritone voice . He gazed down at her with steely gray eyes , and for the umpteenth time in her life Jane wished she were taller . At five feet four and not much more than a hundred pounds dripping wet , looking as formidable as she would have liked was hard . But attitude could make a difference . She 'd found that out early on . " In exchange for a free stay at one of the cabins , " she countered . " I do n't want something for nothing . " She might not be big , but she had lots of pride . His expression turned wary as he aimed another look at the small log cabins set against towering pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any safe enough to stay in ? I 'd hate to hear a roof collapsing on me in the middle of the night . " " The roofs are sound . " She would n't mention the leaks . " The whole place just needs some fixing up . " " I 'll say . " He blew out a breath and ran a long-fingered hand through his dark , expertly cut hair . " From what I 've seen , the best thing you 've got going for you is the view . " Jane switched around to take in a scene that would impress the most jaded of people . Low mountains encircled the small , sun-splashed city of Harmony , located a hundred winding miles northeast of Phoenix and its lower desert regions . Glory Ridge ran along the side of one of those mountains . The resort named after the ridge became part of the picture back when Harmony was a much younger version of itself . " I grew up there , you know , " the man at her side said matter-of-factly . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured you might have when the top guy at Hayward Investments recommended you . He said you were his cousin . " In fact , Ross Hayward , who she 'd been told by people in the know was good for some guidance , had suggested that Adam Lassiter 's talents were just what she needed . She had to hope it was so . " I grew up on a small ranch on the other side of this mountain , " she offered by way of information . He nodded . " So you 're a native of the area , too . Hmm . I ca n't say that I remember the name Pitt . " " Probably because my family did n't get into town much , " she allowed . She could have added that her father , with his gruff-as-a-bear nature , had never been eager to spend time in a city that prided itself on its friendliness . " I was homeschooled until my mother died after a short illness . By then , I was fourteen and ready for Harmony High . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " he stated , casting a critical eye over her . Jane stiffened again in an automatic reaction . " I 'm double that , Mr. Lassiter . " If he heard the irritation underscoring that statement , he ignored it . " My own family moved to the Phoenix area when I was still a kid , " he told her . " I 'm thirty-four now - and it 's Adam . " She could n't even imagine him as a boy . The man he 'd become was far too self-assured . " I go by just plain Jane , " she said , well aware that truer words had never been spoken . She was plain down to her toes , something her late father had pointed out on a regular basis . At the moment , she could hardly deny that Adam Lassiter , with all his polish , made her feel even plainer . Well , to heck with it , Jane thought . She was what she was . Adam caught the swift squaring of slender shoulders covered by a checked cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way from thrilled with him - had known it almost from the minute he 'd pulled into the parking lot a short distance from the largest cabin in the group , which seemed to serve as the resort 's headquarters . After one clearly unimpressed glance at his low-slung sports car , her hazel eyes had fixed on him as she 'd walked over to introduce herself , stray strands of her short hair ruffling in the wind . And what he 'd seen in her gaze could hardly be called approval . Not that he should care one way or the other . And not that he 'd even be here if he did n't have his own agenda . Whether he decided to take Jane Pitt up on her offer would depend on how much it suited his goals as well as hers . " I think it 's time for a better look around , " he said . She nodded . " Sure , I 'll give you the nickel tour . " Which was all a tour might wind up being worth , Adam reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off balance by what he 'd seen so far . For all the beauty of the surrounding area , no one with eyes could deny that the resort was in sad shape - a lot sadder shape than he 'd bargained on . " Should we start here ? " he asked , keeping his tone mild as he indicated the larger cabin with a slant of his head . " I assume that 's where the office is . " " Right . " Jane led the way down a short gravel path , then up a step and across a narrow covered porch . She tugged open an old screen door and stepped inside . Adam followed her into a room bordered by thick log walls and saw mostly what he 'd expected to see . The scene gave , he thought , a whole new meaning to the phrase no frills . Nothing had probably been altered much from the time the place was first built . A long counter , the green tiles topping it scarred with age , stood at one side of the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " Want a can of cold pop ? " He would have preferred bottled water , but he only nodded . Something told him you took what you could get with this woman . " I can help myself , " he said . ( Continues ... )
