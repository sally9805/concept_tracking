<p> CITY RUNS ROUGHSHOD OVER DOGPATCH <p> Editor  --  I could not let the letter in the April 8 paper from Planning Director Gerald Green pass without comment . The arrogance and chutzpah that has been the trademark of the present city administration in general and the Planning Department under Mr. Green in particular are reflected therein , loud and clear . <p> The department certainly has had " BIG " plans for Dogpatch for quite awhile . I have been retained to represent that beleaguered neighborhood at least four times in the past two years to fight inappropriate projects and poorly planned development to which Mr. Green 's department has given rubber-stamp approval , over strenuous neighborhood objection . <p> Very large live/work projects and multiple-unit condos have been raced through the department and planted all over Dogpatch on Minnesota Street , Tennessee Street , Connecticut Street and elsewhere . The planners under Mr. Green 's guidance have ignored the law and the Planning Code provisions that require preservation of existing housing and have ignored the requirements that neighborhood character be preserved and that in-fill development be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developers have been favored over all other interests by the department . <p> Perhaps the most salient aspect of the neighborhood known as Dogpatch is that it is filled with people that dearly love it and are willing to go to the barricades to preserve it , despite the department 's efforts to destroy it by approving one ill-conceived project after another . <p> STEPHEN M. WILLIAMS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> FRISCO FOLLIES <p> Editor  --  Why is everyone so shocked about the current City Hall soap opera ( Letters , April 16 ) ? Insider trading , unlawful evictions , Yaki going up against Reilly to stop the Chron , Katz trying to give dot-coms a break in her new district . . . come on , this is machine politics in action ! <p> Forget about civic duty  --  government today is big business , baby , and self-interest is the name of the game ! Too bad the result is a total lack of confidence in our elected officials to do what 's right ( for everyone ) , and complete political gridlock . Expressways under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge ! <p> Until we learn to turn off the machine once and for all ( public financing of elections ) , we will continue to be willing participants in this sad and sick illusion of democracy . Until then , vote for ABM . That is , " Anyone But the Machine . " I figure , at this point , anyone could do better . <p> MARK O'HARA <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> WOMEN BASHING MEN <p> Editor  --  Moira Gubbins Glynn complained in an April 11 letter ( " Mommies Bashed " ) that a Chronicle writer demeaned women with silly gender stereotypes in a recent article . I wish to add that day after day , week after week , Gail Collins , for example , demeans men in these pages with statements to the effect that " Steel Cage Death Matches " represent the essence of the human male , Ellen Goodman writes that honor killings are " intimately bound up with what it means to be a man , " or Maureen Dowd reports that men are testosterone-crazed shouters obsessed with proving their masculinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue . I am writing this because gender is not the issue . Twenty-five years of hard core genderist analysis not withstanding , 25 years of blaming men for women 's social and sexual strategies to the contrary , and 25 years of all-out marketing of " Women ! " as the " repository of human spirituality " ( as one of your readers wrote recently ) aside , gender has absolutely nothing to do with an individual human being 's ability to become self-aware , trust the process of the manifestation of the universe , and respect the inner and outer space of other people . Gender is yesterday 's news . It is time for journalists to start thinking in more fundamental terms . <p> BILL APPLEDORF <p> Foster City <p> . <p> RUN THE F TO FORT POINT <p> Editor  --  Now that the Muni F-line is working so well , it 's time to consider extending it through the Fort Mason tunnel , past the Marina Green and the Exploratorium , to the Presidio and Fort Point at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of our finest attractions on one beautiful ride . <p> And with the new Giants Pacific Bell Park , Herb Caen would look down and again proclaim that San Francisco is " The City That Knows How ! " <p> BOB DOUGHERTY <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> FARM ' DEVELOPMENTS <p> Editor  --  In a statement released April 10 , Stanford President Gerhard Casper states , " It is disheartening to see Stanford 's position on the foothills and the general-use permit so thoroughly distorted by our critics in some of their most recent public statements and advertisements . " <p> This comes from the president of a university that plays with words to manipulate the public into thinking all is well on the Farm . Their latest trick is to declare that there will be no development in the " Foothills District " of the university . They do n't mention that the " Foothills District " keeps shrinking as the university renames sections it would like to develop . <p> In its general-use permit application submitted to Santa Clara County , Stanford Management Company has renamed 154 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attempting to redesignate this area as " core campus . " They are proposing 20,000 square-feet of development over the next 10 years ( 41,000 square-feet if you include the Carnegie Institute ) , and after that , the area could be developed as densely as the rest of campus . <p> The Stanford Open Space Alliance welcomes a public debate with President Casper to clear the air on these issues . Let 's hope the president will step out from behind the university 's PR department and enter into constructive dialogue with the Stanford community . <p> PETER DREKMEIER <p> Stanford Open Space Alliance <p> . <p> HIGH-TECH VISAS <p> Editor  --  The high-tech lobby is spending money in Washington like it 's going out of style to get further increases in the H-1B visas . If the market for computer programmers is that tight , why are Sun Microsystems , Microsoft and other computer companies hiring only 2 percent of all applicants for these jobs  --  figures from Diversity Alliance . <p> If the CEOs of these high-tech companies want to raise the cap to 200,000 they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they hire every graduate in these sciences from Europe , Taiwan and India it still wo n't be 200,000 . <p> This program has been abused from the start . The form can be filled in by anyone , and as long as the words are in the right places , that is all the government cares about . <p> Now if the high-tech executives want to legitimize this issue , there should be one category for high-tech sciences alone . Now they can hire one programmer , one physical therapist , one nurse who can also double up as a nanny , and assorted flunkies to take care of the CEO 's needs . No government checking documents , no verifying educational skills . <p> This is just one 100 percent bona-fide fraud foisted on the American people . And it is time to stop all this before big business destroys this country . <p> J.L. DUNLAVEY <p> San Jose <p> . <p> TREES BEFORE PEOPLE <p> Editor  --  We would like to try and clear up some untruths and misconceptions being told by the Sierra Club regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already well protected . <p> We will be forced to relinquish ( meaning : give up ) our property to the government just as the people had to do because of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah . <p> And yes the citizens in Central Valley seem to be the most opposed to this Monument because it is in our back yard . It is going to hurt too many people . There is too much at risk . Jobs , property , recreational sports , just to name a few . <p> President Clinton is overstepping his authority by wanting 400,000 acres for 20,000 acres of already protected Giant Sequoia trees . We know they are protected , we live near them and we have property among them , there are eight on our property . There is no logging of them . We love them and want them protected . They are because of President George Bush 's presidential proclamation . <p> The Sierra Club , Earth First , NRDC , to name a few , seem to have one thing on their agenda and that is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets hurt ! <p> Mr. President , there are too many people that this will hurt . <p> MIKE &; VERNA HATCHER <p> Porterville
