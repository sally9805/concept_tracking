EDITOR 'S NOTE <p> Due to the controversial nature of all Post Family stories , and recent revelations that some popular " nonfiction " titles are slightly less than accurate , the editorial board at TOR Books has at this time decided to classify Mortal Coils as " fiction . " We have no interest in entering the debate over the authenticity of Post Family stories in the popular press . <p> Footnotes to pertinent resources have , however , been added throughout , so enthusiasts and scholars of modern mythology may follow up with their own research and draw their own conclusions to what is the most exciting contemporary legend of our time . <p> Eric Raab <br> Editor , TOR Books <br> New York <p> When we have shuffled off this mortal coil , <br> Must give us pause . There 's the respect <br> That makes calamity of so long life , <br> For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , <br> The oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's contumely , <br> The pangs of despis 'd love . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene 1 <p> SECTION I <p> BIRTHDAY <p> 1 <p> TWO LITTLE NOBODIES <p> Eliot Post and his sister , Fiona , would be fifteen tomorrow and nothing interesting had ever happened to them . They lived with their grandmother and great-grandmother , who , with their **25;621;TOOLONG ways , held them captive from anything exciting . Eliot slid a plastic milk crate to his dresser and stepped up to see into the mirror . He frowned at his mop of unruly black hair ; the bowl cut had grown shaggy . At least it covered his ears , which stuck out . He looked like a dork . He smoothed his fingers through the mess and it fell into place ... then the cowlicks sprang up . If only he had some hair gel . There was , however , a rule banning brand-name shampoo , soap , and other " luxury " items . His great-grandmother concocted homemade versions instead . They cleaned ( occasionally stripping off the first layer of skin ) but left something to be desired in the fashion department . Eliot glanced at the pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 106 rules that governed every breath he took . The lack of hair gel was covered by RULE 89 . <p> RULE 89 : No extravagant household products  --  including , but not limited to , store-bought soaps , shampoos , paper towels , and other unnecessary disposable goods . <p> Fortunately this did not include toilet paper . <br> The clock on his dresser made a rusty " ping . " It was ten o'clock . The lunch shift started at Ringo 's All American Pizza Palace in forty minutes . He suppressed a shudder , already tasting the sweet dough and pepperoni grease that would permeate his skin . <p> Eliot grabbed his homework off his desk . He flexed his hand , working free the stiffness from writing all night . It 'd been worth it . He was proud of his report on the War of 1812 . Grandmother would have to give him an A. <p> His thoughts of the Chesapeake campaign and " The Star-Spangled Banner " vanished as a car drove past outside . Three stories on the street below , its radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music washed through him , swept aside all thoughts of homework , pizza , rules , and for one moment he was somewhere else : a hero on the high seas , cannons blasting , and wind screaming through the sails . <p> The car passed and the music faded . <p> Eliot would have done anything for a radio of his own . " Music is a distraction , " Grandmother had told him over and over . There was , naturally , a rule for it , too . <p> RULE 34 : No music , including the playing of any instruments ( actual or improvised ) , singing , humming , electronically or by any means producing or reproducing a rhythmic melodic form . <p> It sucked . All of Grandmother 's rules did . He never got to do anything he wanted . . . except , of course , read . <p> Three entire walls of his room were not walls at all , but floor-toceiling bookshelves installed sometime in the Precambrian era by Great-Grandmother . <p> Two thousand fifty-nine volumes lined his tiny bedroom : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gleaming gold letters , all exuding a scent of moldering paper and well-worn leather , the entirety a solid mass of age and authority.1 <p> Eliot ran a hand over their vertebrae  --  Jane Austen ... Plato ... Walt Whitman . He loved his books . How many times had he escaped to differ <p> 1 . Excavation of what experts believe was the Oakwood Apartments building ( the alleged Post Family residence ) revealed the remains of more than one hundred thousand books on all floors : leather bindings , partial pages , literally tons of parchment ash , and a handful of intact volumes . These fueled the intense blaze that eventually caused the entire town of Del Sombra to burn to the ground . Gods of the First and Twenty-first Century , Volume 11 : The Post Family Mythology , 8th ed . ( Zypheron Press Ltd . ) . <p> ent countries , centuries long past , with colorful characters as his companions ? <p> He just wished his life could be as interesting . <p> Eliot went to open his bedroom door , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared at them , knowing the biggest rule of all was unwritten . RULE 0 : No escaping the rules . <p> He sighed , twisted the doorknob , and pushed open his door . <p> Light spilled into the darkened corridor . At the same instant a second rectangle of light appeared as his sister 's door opened . Fiona wore a green gingham dress , a tattered suede belt , and sandals that laced up her calves . <p> People said they looked alike , but she was five foot five inches , while Eliot was still only five foot three inches . For being his twin sister , she did n't really look anything like him . Her posture was wet-noodle limp , hair in her eyes except when it was n't pulled into a tail of frizz , and she chewed on her nails . <p> She stepped into the hallway at the exact same second as Eliot . She was always pretending this synchronicity thing to annoy him . The myth was that twins always thought the same thing , mirrored each other 's motions  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been waiting at her door , listening for his to open . Well , he was n't buying it . <p> " You look sick , " Fiona said , her voice dripping with mock sympathy . " Naegleria fowleri ? " <p> " Have n't been swimming , " he replied . " So maybe you 're the one with brain-eating amoebas . " <p> He 'd read Rare Incurable Parasites , volume 3 , as well . <p> This was their favorite game : vocabulary insult . <p> " Lochsmere , " he said , and eyed her contemptuously . <p> Her brow scrunched in concentration . <p> That was a tough one  --  a character from the thirteenth-century Twixtbury Chronicles by Vanden Du Bur . Lochsmere was a plague-ridden dwarf , evil and puppy-drowning vile . <p> The Twixtbury text lay on the top shelf of the hallway bookcase , covered in a layer of dust . No way she had read it . <p> Fiona caught his look , followed it , and smiled . <p> " You have me confused for noble G'meetello , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obviously you . " <p> So she had read it . Okay . The score was still nothing to nothing . <p> Fiona half-closed her eyes and murmured , " Sometimes , little brother , I think your wit so tantalizing it would be better for everyone if you were at Tristan da Cunha . " <p> Tristan da Cunha ? He did n't know that one . <p> " No fair using foreign words . " <p> Fiona had a talent for languages , while he did not . They had a pact , though : no foreign words from her and no made-up words from him in their games of vocabulary insult . Eliot had a particular talent for finding colorful but nonsensical terms that had no place in any dictionary . <p> " It 's not foreign , " she said , beaming with satisfaction . <p> He believed her . They never lied in vocabulary insult . <p> Eliot tried to puzzle it out . Tristan ... like the knight of legend ? Maybe a castle ? Fiona was forever reading travel journals . That had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , adopting his best fake ironic air . " Behind its walls I might be safe from seeing your face . " <p> Fiona blinked . " A good guess , but absolutely wrong . Tristan da Cunha is an island in the South Atlantic , thirteen hundred miles from the nearest inhabited land . Population two hundred eighty . I believe their official currency is the potato . " <p> Eliot deflated . " Great , you win , " he muttered . " No big deal . I let you . Happy early birthday . " <p> " You 've never let anyone win anything . " She gave a short laugh . " Happy birthday to you , too . " <p> " Come on . " Eliot brushed past her . <p> She caught up to him and squeezed by . Thousands more volumes crowded the hallway on either side , from hardwood floors to water-stained plaster ceiling . <p> They emerged in the dining room and squinted as their eyes adjusted to the light . A picture window showed the brick building across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires , only partially obscured by the overflowing bookcases on all sides . <p> Great-Grandma Cecilia sat at the dining table writing letters to her many cousins . Her paper-thin skin was a web of wrinkles . She wore a brown dress that buttoned all the way up her throat and looked as if she could have stepped out of a tin daguerreotype . <p> Cecilia beckoned to them and hugged Fiona , then Eliot , adding a dry kiss for good measure . <p> He returned her trembling embrace , but oh so gingerly , because he was afraid he 'd break her . A hundred and four years old was nothing to fool with . <p> Eliot loved his great-grandmother . She always had time to listen to him , no matter what she was doing . She never gave him advice or orders . She was just there for him . <p> " Good morning , my darlings , " she whispered . Her voice was the rustle of autumn leaves . <p> " Morning Cee , " Eliot and Fiona said together . <p> Eliot shot his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that synchronicity thing . Just to get to him . <p> Cecilia patted his hand . " Yesterday 's homework . " She nodded to the papers on the edge of the table . <p> Fiona was a little closer and grabbed them before Eliot . She frowned , peeling off the top sheets , and passed them to him . " Yours , " she murmured , then focused on the rest of the pages . <p> Eliot took them , annoyed that she had looked at his grade before he could . <p> A large C + had been scratched at the top of last week 's essay on the Thomas Jefferson Memorial . Next to it was Fine thesis . Flawed execution . Writing closer to aboriginal than English . <p> Eliot winced . He had tried so hard . He had all the ideas in his head , but when he put them onto paper , everything got tangled . <p> He glanced at Fiona ; her olive complexion had paled . He stepped closer and spotted the large C - on her page . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's okay , " Eliot said . " We 'll help each other rewrite them tonight . " <p> Fiona nodded . She took bad grades harder than Eliot , as if she had something to prove to Grandmother . Eliot had given up trying to live up to her expectations . Nothing was ever good enough . Sometimes he just wished that she 'd leave them alone . <p> " Alone or together , " said Grandmother , " I expect those rewritten tonight along with your new assignment . " <p> Eliot jumped and turned . <p> Grandmother stood behind them in the hallway , arms folded over her chest , one hand holding two crisply typed pages . <p> " Good morning , Grandmother , " Eliot said . <p> It was Grandmother always . It was never Audrey or Gram , or any other pet name like they used with Cecilia . Not that it was forbidden , but Grandmother was the only thing they ever thought to call her . It was the only title that carried the authority her presence demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and towered over them at an even six feet . Her silver hair was shorn with military precision , and her olive complexion had not a single wrinkle , even though she was sixty-two years old . She wore a plaid flannel shirt buttoned all the way to the top , jeans , and steel-toed boots . Her expression , as usual , was one of ironic inscrutability . <p> She handed them the pages : tonight 's homework , which consisted of seven geometric proofs and a new essay on Isaac Newton 's personal life . <p> Eliot flexed his hand and wondered how short he could make this new essay and still get a passing grade . A passing grade according to Grandmother was an A- . She always told them that " excellence is the least that is expected of you " and made them rewrite subpar papers until they were good enough . <p> " They 've had breakfast ? " Grandmother asked Cecilia . <p> " At eight thirty . " Cecilia gathered her letters and envelopes into a neat stack . " Oatmeal , juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper limit of Cecilia 's cooking ability . Eliot always offered to help , but she never let him . <p> Grandmother plucked up their turned-in homework , and her gray eyes scanned the first lines noncommittally . " They should go , " she said . " Being late for work will not do . " <p> " Could n't . . . " Cecilia 's weathered hand curled around her throat . " I mean , tomorrow are their birthdays . Must they do homework the night before  --  " <p> Grandmother shot Cecilia a look that guillotined her words midsentence . <p> Cecilia looked down at her letters . " No , of course not , " she whispered . " Silly of me . " <p> Not even Cecilia could get Grandmother to bend a rule . Eliot loved her for trying , though . <p> Grandmother turned to Eliot and Fiona and tapped her wristwatch . " Ticktock , " she said , and leaned closer . <p> Fiona gave her a polite kiss on her cheek . Eliot did , too , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled activities . <p> Grandmother gave him the slightest hug . <p> Eliot knew she loved him  --  at least , that 's what Cecilia always said . He wished her " love " would be something other than rules and restrictions , though . Just once he wished she 'd cancel homework and take them all out for a movie . Was n't that " love , " too ? <p> " Lunch is on the table by the door , " Cecilia told them . " Oh , I did n't get to the store yesterday .... " <p> Eliot and Fiona glanced at one another , understanding . <p> Fiona bolted for the front door first and Eliot followed  --  but too late . She grabbed the larger paper bag off the table , the one Cecilia had slipped the last apple into , and ran out the door . <p> Eliot reluctantly grabbed the remaining bag , knowing it only contained a dry tuna-fish sandwich on rye . <p> " Have a good day , my darlings , " Cecilia called after them , smiled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks , Cee , " Eliot whispered . <p> He ran after Fiona , down the hall , past the elevator , and to the stairs . She was always trying to outrace him  --  everything was a competition with Fiona . <p> Eliot was n't about to let her win without a fight . By the time he hit the upper landing , though , Fiona was half a floor ahead of him , her longer legs carrying her farther , faster . <p> He chased her down the three flights , round and round , Eliot now only a few feet behind  --  until they burst through the steel security door onto the street . <p> It was a sunny day in Del Sombra , and they rested a moment in the narrowing shadow of the brick fatade of their apartment building . <p> On Midway Avenue peach trees sat in planters . Their branches swayed in the warm breeze and dropped not-quite-ripe fruit on the road to be spattered by the tourists racing to Sonoma County . <p> " I won , " Fiona said , breathing heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her paper-bag lunch . " Extra apple , too . You need to be faster , Bradypus . " <p> Bradypus was the genus name for the three-toed sloth , one of the slowest mammals in the world . <p> Eliot 's mood darkened , but he did n't let her bait him into another round of vocabulary insult ; instead he just shot her a glare . <p> He unclenched his paper-bag lunch , still in a tight grip from their sprint . A metallic clink came from inside . Eliot unrolled and then peered into the bag . At the bottom were two quarters . That was Cee , trying to make things even between him and his sister . <p> Eliot plucked them out and held them up to the sunlight . They gleamed like liquid mercury . <p> Fiona grabbed for them  --  but this time he was quicker . <p> " Ha ! " he said , snapping them securely into his fist . <p> He 'd use them to buy carrot juice from the health-food store on his break . Better than the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He dropped them back into the bag . <p> Fiona shrugged as if those quarters did n't mean anything to her , and she briskly started to walk down the sidewalk . <p> Eliot knew her ; it mattered . <p> He caught up to her . " You think anything 's going to happen tomorrow ? " <p> " Like what ? " Fiona asked . " New rules ? " <p> His stride faltered . It was a distinct possibility . Grandmother 's list of rules grew longer every year . The latest entry was just five weeks ago . <p> RULE 106 : No dating  --  single , double , dutch , chaperoned or not , or otherwise . <p> As if that were going to happen in his lifetime . Maybe it was for Fiona . The guys at work sometimes talked to her . <p> " I just thought . . . , " Eliot said , running to catch up to his sister . " I do n't know . Like school  --  maybe we 'll go to a real school . With other kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every night ? " <p> Fiona said nothing , her silence voicing her opinion . <p> Other kids were sometimes a problem for him and his sister . While Eliot knew the capital of Angola ( Luanda ) , the number of genes in the earthworm , Caenorhabditis elegans ( about nineteen thousand ) , ask him to make small talk with a girl and his IQ dropped thirty points . <p> " Yeah , " he said , " maybe not such a great idea . " <p> But something new had to happen . Almost fifteen years old . You could n't live your entire life just doing the same thing every day : Ringo 's , homework , reading , chores , sleeping . <p> Was this what it was going to be like until he was eighteen ? Would Grandmother keep them home until twenty-one ? Forty ? Until they were as old as Cee ? <p> Fiona brushed back her hair , hooking it over her ear . " I want to travel , " she said in a faraway voice . " Go to Athens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the places we 've read about . " <p> His sister had the right idea . He turned the same fantasy over in his head every day : running far away . Where would they go ? And more important , how could they ever defy Grandmother ? <p> He and Fiona might as well have been corked inside a bottle , sailing nowhere on a tiny balsa-wood ship . <p> " Could be worse . " Fiona nodded ahead at the entrance to an alley . " We could be like your friend there . " <p> From the shadows in the alley , a pair of worn sneakers missing their laces protruded onto the sidewalk . Holes in their soles revealed bare feet inside . <p> " He 's not my friend , " Eliot muttered . " He 's just some guy . " <p> Fiona increased her pace as they neared the shoes . <p> The sneakers were attached to tattered jeans and a tangle of gray rags that might once have been a trench coat . <p> They saw this old man every day on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners or like today sat in the shadows . And while his location changed . . . his smell never did : a combination of sardines , body odor , and burnt matches . <p> Eliot slowed to a halt . <p> The old man 's face squinted up at him , his leathery skin contorting into a mass of deep laugh lines and white scars . His lips parted into a greasy smile ; he leaned forward and held out an Angels ' baseball cap . A piece of cardboard jammed into the brim had the word vet printed on it . <p> Eliot held up his hand . " Sorry I do n't . . . " <p> His words trailed off as he saw a kidney-shaped object tucked behind the man . A violin . <p> Eliot could almost feel the waves of sound resonating off it , almost taste the notes , sweet and wavering , oscillating through his skull . He wanted to touch it  --  even though he 'd never played any instrument before . <p> The old man followed Eliot 's stare , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He pulled the violin into his lap and ran his thumb over the chipped fingerboard ... for all the good it would do . All the strings were missing . <p> The music in Eliot 's head screeched to a halt . <p> He would have given anything to hear him play . <p> The man 's smile vanished and he set his cap over the violin . <p> Eliot bit his upper lip , unrolled his lunch bag , and fished out the two quarters . <p> Fiona stopped , watching him . She set her hands on her hips and shook her head . <p> Eliot did n't care what his sister thought ; the money was his to spend any way he wanted . <p> " You should buy a few strings , " Eliot whispered to the old man . " I bet you could make more money if you played a little . " He dropped the quarters into the cap . <p> The man grasped the coins , rubbed them together , gazed lovingly at the violin ... and then back up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes brimmed with tears . <p> 2 <p> CHOCOLATE HEART <p> Fiona could n't believe her brother . She watched him drop his quarters in the bum 's baseball cap . Only ten minutes older than Eliot , she sometimes felt it might as well be ten years . How could he be such a little boy ? She stalked back to extricate him , before he gave his lunch away , too . The old man looked from Eliot to her and his gaze hardened . He glanced her over . It was n't the way boys sometimes looked at her . " Elevator eyes " she had heard other girls call it . This was more as if he could see past her skin , right down to her bones . She could smell him now , too : sardines , a month of curdled body odor , and smoke . The stench aside , there was a magnetic repulsion , too . She just wanted to get as far away from the old man as she could . He gave her the creeps . She grabbed Eliot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she whispered . " We 're going to be late . " She jerked him toward her . " Yeah , " he said , still looking back at the old man . They fell into their hurry-up stride . " You might as well have tossed your money down the storm drain , " she said . " That guy ca n't even play . Probably found that violin in the trash . " " Sure he can play , " Eliot muttered , and rubbed his hand . " I bet he 's good , too . " Eliot was too nice sometimes , and people like that bum took advantage of him . For a moment she considered turning around and getting his money back . But maybe it would be better if Eliot learned that not everyone operated by Grandmother 's 106 rules . At fifty cents , it would be a lesson learned cheaply . <p> He had that dopey look on his face whenever he talked about music . Fiona knew better than to lecture Eliot about RULE 34  --  you might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brick wall about aerodynamics . <p> She wondered what life would be like without having to look after him . Eliot was always trying to find ways around the rules , and getting them both into trouble . <p> Like it or not , though , he was her brother  --  like a third , mutated arm growing from the middle of her chest  --  he was annoying , but she could n't quite bring herself to cut him off . <p> " Cee told me you were adopted , " she told him . " I saw the birth certificate . It said , ' Eliot Post . Sarcoptes scabiei . ' " <p> This was a microscopic mite that caused scabies , whose symptoms included pimplelike irritations and intense itching . <p> Eliot scratched his head . " Got to get your nose out of the medical books . I 've read them all , too . Are you losing your touch ? A dose maybe of Mycobacterium leprae ? " <p> That was the strain of bacteria , also called Hansen 's bacillus , that caused leprosy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Midway and Vine . Across the street was Sol Granda Florists , perfumed by a hundred dozen roses and bushels of lavender . Fiona wished someone would send her roses once in her life . Just once . Anyone . <p> Kitty-corner from this was The Pink Rabbit , a health-food co-op and juice bar . A plywood rabbit sat upright on the corner drinking from a plastic cup full of frothy green liquid . Eliot loved to hang out there . Thursday afternoons was open mic , where he pretended never to listen to the folksingers . <p> Opposite the Rabbit squatted the Colonial columns of Ringo 's All American Pizza Palace . It was supposed to look like a miniature version of the White House in Washington , D.C. . . . only one of the wings was bare cinder block  --  a recent addition that would one day house four lanes of bowling . Next to the double-glass-door entrance was a mural of Uncle Sam with a red , white , and blue bowling ball in one hand , and in the other a wedge of gooey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three buildings collided : rose , lavender , freshly pulped carrots and oranges , clove cigarettes , yeast , and pepperoni . <p> The nexus of all these things that did n't belong together , of course , was Ringo 's . Pizza originally came from Naples , Italy . Bowling came from Germany or possibly ancient Egypt . And the Colonial architecture drew much of its influence from Renaissance style . This logically made it " All American . " <p> They hesitated at the double glass doors . <p> Fiona did n't want to go in . More was wrong with Ringo 's than clashing styles , busing tables , and washing dishes . <p> Behind them , however , was the invisible hand of Grandmother pushing them onward . Work is the cornerstone of character , she was always telling them . <p> They had worked at Oakwood Apartments for Grandmother since Fiona could remember , sweeping and polishing the miles of wood flooring . As soon as they turned thirteen , Grandmother obtained work permits for them ( Fiona suspected they were forged ) and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbing the handle and pulling it open for Eliot . <p> " Come on , " she said . " It 's only a four-hour shift . We can do it . " <p> " Yeah . " Eliot 's face screwed into a mask of worry . " It 'll be easy . " <p> He moved through the doorway and Fiona stepped through with him . The air-conditioning hit her like an arctic gale . It was always too cold in here . She should have worn her sweater over this dress . <p> The day manager , Mike , stood at the host 's podium , arms crossed over his chest . <p> " Five minutes late , " he announced . " I 'm going to dock an hour 's pay . " <p> Eliot started to step forward , but she bumped him  --  a warning to keep his mouth shut . <p> They were n't late ... even stopping for that bum , they had had fifteen minutes to get here . The less said to Mike , however , the better . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mike Poole was back in Del Sombra for the summer . He was a sophomore at Berkeley . He might have been handsome with a shock of silky red hair , and freckled forearms , but his eyes held all the intelligence of a bovine 's and a glimmer of cruelty . <p> He slipped a slender book under the podium 's calendar , but not before Fiona saw it was Cliff 's Notes on Macbeth . <p> She 'd read her version of the play a dozen times.2 <p> Fiona could probably recite Macbeth to Mike if she had to and help him sound out the big words . <p> " So ... Fiona . " Mike stepped around the podium . " Think over the hostess thing ? I could train you . It 'd be easy . " He smiled and that evil-cow gaze dropped and then traced up her length with elevator eyes . " You 'd be great . " <p> Fiona looked away , her shoulders hunched , and she felt her face heat . " Not so good with people , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's part of the training , " Mike cooed . <p> Next to her , Eliot balled his hands into fists . <p> Fiona stepped in front of her brother . " It 's okay , " she said . " Busing is fine . It 's great . " <p> " Suit yourself . " Mike snorted . " Someone on the night shift got sick , and they left the party room for you . " Mike finally noticed Eliot and said , " Trash cans need rinsing today , kid . Get to it before dishes . Make sure you use bleach . " <p> " No problem , " Fiona said . <p> She moved past Mike , and Eliot followed her into the dining room . In the back was the separate party room , and to their left was the swinging door that led to the kitchen . <p> She felt Mike 's eyes locked on her backside and revised her estimation of them : They were n't cow eyes . That was unfair to bovines . He had the eyes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . Five of the fifteen tables already had lunchtime customers , people wearing the uniforms of wine-country tourists : men in khaki slacks and loose silk shirts ; the women in designer jeans , sweaters , and sixteen pounds of gold jewelry . <p> The place would be packed by eleven thirty , and Eliot and Fiona would be running to get everything clean for the real crowds at noon . <p> Ringo 's may have been a conglomeration of unlikely styles and questionable taste , but situated on the most picturesque country artery between San <p> 2 . One artifact found intact at the Oakwood Apartments site was a Complete Works of William Shakespeare , published in the eighteenth century ( ref catalog : 49931-D ) . It is intriguing as every mythological reference had been stricken with an indelible marker . For example , passages mentioning Hecate , and the entire scene with the three witches , had been redacted from Macbeth .

His eyes had been glued to Linda , who waited tables today . Linda had that effect on guys . <p> Fiona grabbed Eliot by the shoulders and pointed him toward the swinging kitchen door . " Better get busy before Mike comes looking , " she murmured . <p> He blinked . " Right . " <p> " Keep your head above water . " This was a not-so-veiled reference to his height , his poor swimming ability , and the gigantic sink where he 'd be spending the next four hours . <p> Eliot glowered , then brightened as he thought of his own insult : " Keep it clean . " <p> This was a reference to the messy reality of Fiona 's job : busing tables at Ringo 's meant getting up close and personal with spattered marinara sauce , spilled olive oil , cornmeal crumbs . . . all of which got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . And although she showered every night , the scents lingered . <p> Eliot pushed through the kitchen door , and Fiona grabbed the busing cart by the wall , maneuvering it back toward the party room . <p> She observed Linda as she chatted with the customers about the road and the weather . Customers always laughed at Linda 's jokes , and when she suggested the pasta special , they usually ordered it . Maybe it was her looks . She could have been a model with her perfect makeup , spiky blond hair , and the way her skirt , pink shirt , and long , curved nails seemed to color coordinate . <p> Linda even deflected Mike 's come-ons , somehow smiling all the time as he stood too close and stared at her . She always had an excuse not to go out with him , yet he never got angry with her . <p> She spotted Fiona , gave her a nod and a smile , which instantly faded . <p> Just like Mike , Linda managed to appear friendly to Fiona without ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . She straightened her dress , although no matter what she did , it still looked wrinkled . She wished she had the nerve to tell Cee she hated the clothes she made them , but that would have broken the old woman 's heart . <p> She snuck another glance at Linda , laughing with her customers . They left her great tips . It was n't just her looks . Linda knew how to talk to people . Fiona would have given anything to be as confident . Every time she had to talk to strangers , her heart pounded so hard she could barely hear her own mouse voice as it tried to squeak out something clever . She could n't look someone in the eyes to save her life , and she spent most of the day staring at her feet . <p> If shyness were a disease , Fiona would have been rushed to intensive care and put on a social respirator . <p> She sighed and halted at the party room doors . <p> Something was wrong ; they were shut . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers could see the large table that sat two dozen , the wet bar and the television , and be tempted to book it for sports events or birthday parties . Forty dollars and it was yours for the evening . <p> Then the smell hit her : vanilla and pesto and an acrid scent that was n't food ... anymore . <p> She stiffened and pulled the sliding doors apart . <p> It was instantly apparent what had happened last night : twenty sugar-crazed spider monkeys had been locked in this room under the pretense of a six-year-old 's birthday party . Scattered on the walls , floor , and only by the sheerest of coincidences the table , were pasta , pizza crusts , globs of congealed cheese , baby-blue frosting , and pools of melted ice cream . And over everything was a sprinkling of confetti . <p> In the corner was a chunky orange spatter , and Fiona then understood that when Mike had told her someone on the night shift had gotten sick , he did n't mean one of the staff . <p> Fiona pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No need to expose the paying customers to this . <p> She pulled a hairnet over her head , then tied a bandanna over this . Next came a chin-to-knee , white linen apron , and finally she snapped on thick rubber gloves . This was her armor . <p> She swept up the confetti , food , and bits of wrapping paper ( which had tiny robots on it ) . She then used the dustpan to scrape off slimier things . <p> Fiona wondered what it would be like to have a real birthday party . She and Eliot had a brief ceremony on the morning of their birthdays . Cee tried to make something special for breakfast , and they pretended to enjoy it . There were presents : books usually , pen sets , or blank journals . But never wrapped in colored paper . And certainly not paper with robots printed on it . <p> Of course to have a real birthday party you needed friends and balloons and games . Fiona could never see that happening in Grandmother 's apartment . <p> She halted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly angry at Grandmother and her 106 rules . <p> Could Fiona be like Linda without those rules ? Able to speak to people ? Smile ? Keep her eyes off her shoes ? She would n't have a job . She 'd have spent her summers at her friends ' houses , slumber parties , and midnight movies ... mythological occurrences that seemed far less real to her than the dusty histories on the shelves of her room . <p> Fiona felt drained . She would just lie down and they could find her here at the end of the shift . <p> A flash caught her eye . A fleck of red foil , partially hidden under a paper plate , glimmered . She moved the plate and spied a piece of unwrapped candy . Printed on it were the words ultra dark special . <p> Her heart quickened and she stepped closer . <p> It was chocolate . <p> While not specifically forbidden by Grandmother 's rules , it was as rare in her life as a day without homework . Cee had it in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick of bitter baking chocolate . . . which she then transformed into cookies , mole , and Christmas fudge  --  that were only by a loosest definition " eatable . " Fiona had snuck a taste once , a few chips before Cee had rapped her knuckles with a wooden spoon . It had been worth it . <p> She gingerly removed one glove and picked up the morsel . It was heart-shaped and was at first cold , but then quickly warmed to her touch . <p> Should she save it for after work ? No . A million things could happen between now and then to the tiny sweet  --  dunked in water , smashed , stolen  --  best to eat it now . <p> What about Eliot ? She should share it with him , should n't she ? <p> It was so small , though . Maybe two bites . <p> She removed her other glove and carefully peeled back the red foil . Inside was a dark lozenge of black with swirls of midnight and eddies of the deepest brown . She inhaled a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whispers . <p> She took the tiniest bite . <p> The chocolate was smooth and yielded to her teeth . She closed her eyes and let it dissolve on her tongue , spreading like velvet . Warmth coursed through her blood into her chest and stomach and thighs . The melting confection was sweet and bitter , smoky and electrically wonderful , and it slid over her palate . <p> She swallowed and her pulse thundered . She inhaled and held her breath a long moment , then let it all out with a sigh . <p> It was so good . <p> And then it was gone . <p> Was that what it would be like to kiss a boy ? Like falling ? Prickly heat and chills at the same time ? <p> She looked at the half morsel still in her hand , one side scalloped from her bite . Her mouth watered . <p> As much as she wanted it , she steeled herself , then with great and deliberate care wrapped it back within the red foil . <p> That was for Eliot . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She folded the chocolate in a clean paper towel and slid the precious package into her dress pocket . <p> Fiona pulled her gloves back on . <p> She felt better now . Full of energy . <p> Fiona finished cleaning the room faster than she ever imagined she could . The wooden floor and the Formica table gleamed . The only scent left in the place was a faint whiff of pine cleaner . . . although if she tried , Fiona could still remember the way the chocolate smelled . <p> She touched her pocket to make sure it was still there . <p> Fiona then opened the doors and pushed the now laden cart back to the kitchen . <p> As she wheeled through the swinging door , a blast of steamy air washed over her , along with the smells of strong soap and bleach . The day-shift cook gave her a quick wave . Each of Johnny 's massive hands could toss a whirling cake of dough into the air at the same time . He returned his attention to the ovens . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Eliot was in the back of the kitchen , by the deep fryer . He stood hunched over the sink , which was as large as a bathtub . On either side towered stacks of sauce-spattered dishes , pans , and pots , all apparently left from last night . <p> Mike was always doing this to her and her brother : coming in the night before and telling the late shift to leave their mess for them . <p> Did he pick on Eliot because of his homemade clothes ? Because he was smaller ? Or did Fiona 's refusing his offers have something to do with it ? <p> She would never understand Mike Poole , and she did n't particularly want to , either . <p> " Need help ? " she asked . <p> Eliot continued to scrub under the dingy water . " I 'm fine . " He tried to wipe the suds off his forehead , but his hand was just as soapy and left a new trail of scum there . <p> Fiona took the edge of her apron and wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Fiona then removed the paper towel containing the chocolate from her pocket . She set it on a high shelf far away from the sink . <p> " No one 's going to notice if I 'm gone for a few minutes , " she told him . " I 'm helping . " <p> Eliot nodded , unable to say " thank you " twice to his sister in the same day . She understood ; it was apparently against the brother-sister code of never being too nice to one another . <p> Fiona stepped up to a stack of dishes . Cheese , sauces , and pasta had hardened to iron-hard consistency overnight . <p> Eliot scraped off the worst of the gunk with a steel spatula , then did a pre-rinse in scalding water before he handed the offending plate to her for final wash and rinse . <p> In ten minutes working together they moved half of one stack to the drying racks . <p> Fiona 's hair was plastered to her forehead , and her apron was soaked through . <p> The kitchen door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There you are , " she said to Fiona . " Stuff 's piling up out here . " She flashed a not-so-friendly smile , then vanished back to the dining room . <p> Fiona undid her sopping apron , and underneath her dress was soaked and clinging to her skin . She shivered . <p> The kitchen door slammed open and Mike walked in , fuming . " Fiona , what  --  " <p> The urgency in his face drained away as he looked her over . His eyes bore into her . <p> " I 'm going , " she said , and her gaze dropped to the floor . She instinctively hunched over and folded her arms over her chest . Gooseflesh rippled over her body . " I just finished the back room . " <p> " There 's no rush . " Mike 's voice was calm , almost sweet now . He sidled closer . " I really want you to think again about the hostess position . The <p> hours are better . Pay 's better , too . " <p> Fiona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her neck prickled . <p> " She said she was n't interested , " Eliot said , and stepped in front of her . " How many times does she have to say it ? " <p> Fiona saw he held the steel spatula , the sharp edge angled at Mike 's face . <p> Mike 's smooth features rippled with emotion  --  amazement , anger  --  then settled into a serious glare . <p> " Back off , squirt . I 'm talking to your sister . " <p> " Do n't , " Fiona whispered so softly she barely heard herself . <p> Eliot knuckles whitened around the spatula handle . He took a deep breath , then took one step closer to Mike , who towered a foot over him . <p> " No , " Eliot said . " You 're done talking . " <p> They stared at each other for a long time , then Fiona could n't take it anymore . She stood tall , moved next to her brother , and , although it took every ounce of her nerve , locked gazes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fiona said . " I meant it . " <p> Mike took a step back . For a split second , it seemed he was almost scared ... of them both . He snorted . " Okay , whatever . Just get out there and get the tables clean . We 've got customers waiting . " <p> He turned and stormed through the swinging kitchen door . <p> " Thanks , " Fiona whispered to her brother . <p> Eliot , trembling , said nothing and went back to the dishes . <p> Fiona noticed her hands were balled into fists and she relaxed . She felt like throwing up . She 'd never stood up to anyone like that before . Neither of them had . Maybe fifteen was going to be a more interesting year than she had thought . <p> 3 <p> BROKEN TEACUP <p> Eliot , Fiona , and Great-Grandmother Cecilia sat at the dining room table . They all pretended that nothing was happening ... even though something most certainly was . The sun was low in the sky and amber light filtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleamed , and the white porcelain tea set was orange in the twilight . Fiona had changed into her gray sweats after work and had her nose buried in Isaac Newton 's Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica , working on tonight 's essay . Cee squinted through her thick glasses as she wrote a letter to her cousin in Bavaria , scratching out the words with a fountain pen . Eliot could n't focus . He kept replaying the confrontation with Mike in his head , and adrenaline shot through his body as he imagined himself punching that creep in the face . Mike , though , was n't the only factor that made work impossible tonight . There were two other things . Encyclopedias lay opened before Eliot . He had been researching Newton 's mental breakdown in 1675 , but much of the text had been crossed out with a black marker . Eliot inferred these redacted passages dealt with Newton 's interest in alchemy.3 <p> 3 . To what extent Newton pursued alchemy is unknown as his notes on the subject were destroyed in a laboratory fire . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to later discoveries in mathematics , no evidence substantiates this nor any of the more fanciful legends of his Faust-like bargains with higher powers . <p> Sometimes seeing the zebra-striped pages made him so mad he wanted to throw the sullied books across the room . <p> That was Grandmother 's RULE 55 in action . <p> RULE 55 : No books , comics , films , or other media of the science fiction , fantasy , or horror genres  --  especially , but not limited to , the occult or pseudosciences ( alchemy , spirituality , numerology , etc. ) or any ancient or urban mythology . <p> Eliot called this the " nothing made up " rule . <p> Grandmother called the stuff " brain-rotting candy for simple minds . " <p> Honestly , with all the juicy bits blacked out , how was he supposed to write a good essay ? At least she could have just drawn a line through the offending text , so he could see what it was all about . <p> RULE 55 and Mike 's bullying , however , were part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing really bothering all of them tonight was not . <p> Grandmother walked into the dining room from the kitchen . Her face was a mask of concentration , and her gray eyes looked as if they were staring at something miles away . <p> Her usual graceful stride was tense , as if she were waiting for something to spring from the shadows . But that was silly . Nothing ever scared Grandmother . <p> Still , her mood was infectious , and Eliot felt the skin along his spine crawl . <p> Grandmother stopped and cocked her head as if listening . She then smoothed both hands through her short silver hair and said , " I 'm going to check the basement and side doors . " <p> This was her evening security check of the building . It was part of her duties as manager and perfectly normal . Telling them she was doing it , though , like a warning , was not normal . <p> " Of course , " Cee said . Her smile fluttered to life ; she set her pen down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just going to pour the tea . Should we wait for you ? " <p> Chemical analysis of Newton 's remains shows high levels of mercury , which may have been caused by his alchemy experiments and may account for his aberrant behavior in 1675 . Gods of the First and Twenty-first Century , Volume 3 : The Pseudo Sciences , 8th ed . ( Zypheron Press Ltd . ) . <p> Grandmother marched to the front door , her boots clipping over the hardwood . <p> " No , " she called back . She opened the door , paused , and said , " Eliot , eyes back on those books . " <p> Eliot looked down immediately . <p> He heard the door close and the dead bolt lock . <p> Nothing scared Grandmother . Nothing . And the only other thing that ever put a dent in her totally-in-control armor was when Eliot and Fiona asked about Mom and Dad . <p> Eliot never thought of himself as an " orphan . " Orphans were kids like David Copperfield who lived in state-run gulags . He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them even remembered their mom or dad . <p> But every time they asked , Grandmother would patiently explain that there had been a terrible accident at sea . That it happened when Eliot and Fiona were babies . Grandmother and Cecilia were the only close family , so naturally they took them in . No , there were no pictures . Everything had been aboard the ship that sank . <p> Whenever Grandmother told them this story , her smooth features scrunched together and lines wrinkled her forehead  --  not so much in pain , but as if it were physically exhausting for her to form the words . <p> But that paled with whatever was getting to her tonight . The look Eliot had seen in her eyes , well , the only word he could think of was sharp . <p> Fiona looked up from her books at the same time as Eliot , and they glanced at each other . She was thinking the same thing : something was wrong . <p> Eliot shrugged . Fiona bit her lower lip . <p> Cecilia took a jar from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own special mixture of chamomile , stevia , and green tea  --  into a strainer . She set this over the open teapot and poured steaming water through . The teapot had a spiderweb etched into its white glaze.4 <p> " Did anything different happen today ? " Cee asked nonchalantly . She handed Eliot his cup . <p> 4 . " Baba Jaga poured fouled river water , boiling hot , until it spilt from her teapot . The stone pot was coarse and covered with web lace and venomous spiders . ' What are you making ? ' the lost little girl asked , her eyes wide . ' Tea , babushka . ' Baba Jaga smiled showing the points of her teeth . ' Sweet tea for my sweet morsel . ' " Father Sildas Pious , Mythica Improbiba ( translated version ) , c. thirteenth century . <p> " What makes you ask ? " he said . Grandmother 's 106 rules had meticulously been engineered to eradicate anything interesting , and therefore different , from their lives . <p> Cee 's smile vanished for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling . " She handed Fiona a steaming cup . " Making conversation , that 's all . " <p> Every night Cee asked , " How was work ? " Or once in a great while , " Did you have a nice day ? " That was just making conversation . This was n't . <p> And yet , something different had happened : the old man with his violin , then Fiona and him actually standing up to Mike . <p> " Just another day , " Fiona replied as she examined the leaves swirling in her cup . <p> Cee nodded , accepting this , and drank her tea , one gulp , two , three , and it was gone . That was the way she did it . The hotter the beverage , the faster she seemed to drink . <p> Fiona did n't want to tell Cee , and Eliot felt the same way . Talking about their bully boss would just upset her . <p> But there was more to it than that . That moment when Eliot and Fiona had stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen-yearold geeks . They 'd been strong . And if they told anyone about it , maybe the magic of that instant would vanish in a puff of smoke . <p> Eliot took a sip of his tea . It was sweet . Bits of green-tea leaf whirled around like stars in a galaxy . <p> Fiona set her hand on his arm and nodded at Cecilia . <p> Their great-grandmother sat transfixed staring into her empty teacup . Her hand trembled violently and the cup slipped . <p> It fell to the hardwood floor , bounced , and hit again  --  shattering . <p> " Oh , dear , " Cee said , blinking . She rose from her chair . " What a butterfin  --  " <p> The front door opened with such force that it slammed against the wall and shook a cloud of dust off the nearby bookshelf . <p> Grandmother stood silhouetted in the doorway , her long , slender arms hanging loosely at her sides , hands open . <p> " Do not move , " she said . <p> She stepped into the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray eyes darted back and forth surveying the room . " There are fragments everywhere . I will get them . " <p> She moved to the table and knelt , plucking up the largest shards . Bits of tea leaves clung to the inner curves of the broken cup . <p> Oddly Grandmother was n't just picking them up ; in her left hand she cradled them , assembling the base and part of the sides until she held a razor-sharp ceramic lotus . <p> Grandmother stared into the partially reconstructed cup with the same look Eliot had seen before . . . sharp . As if you had asked her what she was doing and she looked up  --  the intensity of her gaze would have cut the question out of your throat . <p> Eliot 's hand involuntarily rose to his neck . <p> Outside the sun set and the clouds blazed orange and scarlet . The light in the dining room tinged red . The white shards in Grandmother 's hand looked as if they were dipped in blood . <p> She drew in a long breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed her hand over the broken cup . She stood and looked at Cee , then Fiona and Eliot . Her eyes were their normal iron gray . <p> " Drink your tea , " she murmured . <p> Eliot and Fiona obeyed . <p> " Cecilia , clean the rest of this up . " <p> " Of course . " Cee hurried into the kitchen for a broom and dustpan . <p> " I can help , " Fiona offered . <p> " No . " Grandmother 's face warmed a bit , and a slight smile struggled to life on her lips . " You two get ready for bed . " <p> " We need to finish our homework , " Eliot protested . " There 's the Newton essay and the rewrite of the 1812 paper . " <p> " Homework is canceled tonight , " Grandmother said . " . . . For your birthdays . " <p> Eliot looked to his sister , and she looked to him . <p> He was n't going to argue , but homework had never before been canceled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you always turned it in . <p> Grandmother gave Fiona a hug and kiss , then knelt and beckoned to Eliot . <p> He embraced her . She barely touched him , though , as if she were afraid she might hurt him if she squeezed too hard . He kissed her cheek , and she his . <p> Eliot and Fiona marched down the hallway . <p> " Even , " Fiona whispered . <p> " Fine , " he whispered back . <p> She said , " One , two , three . . . " <p> They simultaneously blurted out numbers . Eliot 's was seven . Fiona had three . Add them together and you got ten , an even number . <p> She smiled and tromped into the bathroom . <p> Somehow she always won that game . Eliot had n't figured out her trick yet , but there had to be one . <p> He waited in the hallway as it filled with shadows . He snuck a sideways glance into the dining room . Grandmother had her back to him , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cee nodded vigorously , and her hands had stopped their usual shaking . The old woman looked pale . <p> He caught a few hushed words in their conversation  --  in hard German consonants . Fiona was good at languages ; he wished she were out here . <p> He made out one word : versteckt . <p> Maybe all the mystery was about their birthdays tomorrow . Maybe they were planning something different . A surprise . <p> The bathroom door opened and light spilled into the hall . <p> " All yours , stinky , " Fiona said , and marched into her bedroom . <p> Eliot entered the bathroom and closed the door . It smelled of Cecilia 's strong homemade soap . The stuff left his skin tingling , part cleaned , part caustic burn . <p> His attention riveted to a spot of red in the sink : a circle of reflective crumpled crimson foil . <p> He carefully picked it up and saw it was a wrapped chocolate . He glanced at the mirror over the sink . There were smudges . He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fiona 's looping cursive : <p> Eat it quick ! Happy B-Day . <p> He peeled back the foil . Inside was half a chocolate morsel with bite marks on one side . Eliot smiled  --  popped it into his mouth and munched . <p> It was good . . . but before he could even taste it , it was gone . <p> He was n't sure where Fiona had gotten it , but chocolate was a rare treat  --  especially chocolate that Cecilia had n't ruined with her cooking . He loved the old woman , but honestly , one day she was going to poison them all . <p> He carefully wiped the mirror with his towel . <p> Eliot then wadded the foil , wrapped it inside toilet paper , and flushed it away . <p> There was no rule about chocolate , but that did n't mean there could n't be a new one created if Grandmother started finding wrappers . <p> He searched for more surprises , but found none , so he got out the tooth powder and brushed his teeth . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Psst . " <p> Eliot rinsed and crouched by the vent . " Hey  --  thanks . " <p> " It was nothing , " Fiona whispered back . <p> This was how they talked after lights out . The vent in the bathroom was best , but they could listen to each other from their bedroom vents , too , if they put their heads to them and covered themselves with a blanket to muffle the noise . <p> " What do you think is going on tonight ? " Fiona asked . " I get chills when I think about how Grandmother 's acting . " <p> " Yeah . . . " Eliot remembered the intensity of her eyes , and gooseflesh crawled up his arms . " I heard them talking in German . What 's versteckt mean ? " <p> " Um . . . to hide . Or hidden , concealed . " <p> " Maybe they 're talking about birthday presents ? " <p> " Maybe . " Eliot could tell from her flat tone that she did n't think so , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiona finally said , " At work today ... I appreciate what you did . " <p> " It 's okay . I think it 's going to be better at Ringo 's from now on . " <p> " . . . Sure . We better go before they hear us . " <p> " Hey , one more thing . " <p> " What ? " <p> Eliot wanted to say a lot of things . Such as , if he had to get saddled with a creepy sister , he was glad it was her . That none of his homework would be half as good if not for her help . That  --  it even hurt to think about this  --  he kind of somehow almost liked her . <p> But instead he just said , " Happy tomorrow birthday . " <p> " You , too . " <p> The other side of the vent suddenly felt empty . <p> Eliot stood and washed his face , then glanced at the mirror . He still looked like a species of dorkus maximus . Maybe that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned off the light . <p> 4 <p> DRIVER 'S EDUCATION <p> Robert Farmington watched his boss , Marcus Welmann , pick the lock on the frosted-glass door . Technically this was illegal , but it was a lawyer 's office , and those guys mutilated the law all the time anyway . Robert worked for Welmann and Associates Investigations , though there were no " associates , " and neither he nor Welmann were licensed investigators . Tonight they were here to find some confidential files on a missing old lady . No big deal . He glanced down the deserted hallway , then out the window to the street two floors below . This burb was a graveyard at three in the morning . Del Sombra it was called . " Of the shadows " in Spanish . Weird name for a town . He looked back at Welmann as the man levered the tiny lock with his massive arms . Marcus Welmann wore baggy camo pants , a black T-shirt , and running sneakers with the reflective stripes ripped off . Not exactly a male model . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grizzled muscle . His large hands would be the envy of any NBA forward . Great for clobbering . Not so good for delicate work . Robert inched closer and whispered , " You want me to pop it ? I can do it in ten seconds flat . " Welmann turned to Robert . His eyes narrowed  --  a warning that his protTgT better shut his trap or he 'd be waiting outside in the car . Welmann hated saying more than a dozen words a day ; it was part of his Neanderthal act . He had a Harvard MBA and had been a navy med tech , but he always played it dumb , which made people underestimate him . <p> Robert crossed his arms and did his best James Dean back at Welmann  --  not a stretch because Robert wore the black leather jacket , jeans , and biker boots that was the uniform of any teenage rebel . <p> Welmann returned to the stubborn lock and ran one finger over the scratched keyhole . <p> His face brightened . He grabbed the knob , twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Welmann muttered . <p> Within the office a beam of light bisected the shadows . Someone was inside ... and from Robert 's experience it was rarely the janitor . <p> Welmann let go of the knob and slid to the side of the door so whoever was inside would n't see his silhouette out here . <p> Robert flattened himself against the outer hall wall , as well . <p> Welmann waved to get Robert 's attention and pointed back the way they had come , indicating that he hightail it . <p> Robert was n't going anywhere . Eight months of training , he could handle this . <p> Welmann reached for the holster in the small of his back and drew a weighty revolver of polished steel , his Colt Python Elite .357 Magnum . <p> Robert pointed at Welmann 's sneaker and made a " give me " gesture . <p> Welmann unthinkingly grabbed for the Taurus PT-145 in his ankle holster , a tiny polymer gun with a barrel no longer than its slight grip ... but he stopped , pointed emphatically back at Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay put . <p> Robert nodded . With one meaty fist Welmann could easily make him stay put . <p> Welmann gripped the doorknob and burst into the office . <p> Robert peeked inside , spotting the source of the light : a penlight on a desk . It rolled over empty file folders . <p> Welmann snatched up the flashlight and crossed it over his opposite wrist , sweeping his aim over the office . The place was the size of a two-car garage , but it was crammed with six desks , a wall of filing cabinets , and posters of mountains and white-water rafters with the titles persistence and integrity . Light from the sodium-vapor streetlamps outside filtered through the windows and tinged it all unnatural orange . <p> Welmann checked behind every desk . " No one here , " he whispered . " Damned weird . " <p> Robert eased inside and double-checked behind the door . Just shadows there . So who had used that flashlight ? <p> Welmann saw Robert and glared , chewing over words that did n't make it out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted . <p> Robert was about to tell Welmann where he could stuff his " I 'm trying to teach you something " shtick  --  when something appeared behind Robert . . . a creeping presence , big and breathing . It cleared its throat . <p> Robert wheeled around . <p> The shadows behind the door parted like a curtain . A glowing cigarette ember revealed a smile that would have made the Cheshire cat blush . <p> From this slight shadow resolved a Samoan man in a black suit , dark gray shirt , and a black tie with a tiny emerald skull tie tack . <p> Robert thought it was funny that he noticed that little detail  --  because this guy was seven foot , easy , and there had to be four hundred pounds of him poured into that Armani . <p> " Damned weird ? " the man said in a rumble of a baritone voice . " An interesting choice of words . " <p> Robert wanted to panic , that 's what his hammering heart urged him to do . But Welmann had trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comics and watch every D-grade Italian slasher flick . Robert , at least in theory , was ready for the unexplained and unexpected ... and a guy that could flatten a professional NFL linebacker stepping out of nowhere certainly qualified . <p> There was no way they could fight this guy . Nowhere to run . That left two options : shoot him or bluff . <p> Robert swallowed ; his throat was sandpaper . " Hey , how 's it going ? " <p> The smiling Samoan puffed on his cigarette . " I am fine , young man . " He nodded to Welmann . " Set the pistol down . What are you looking for ? " <p> Robert realized he was in Welmann 's line of fire . Rookie mistake . He moved two steps to his left . <p> Welmann glared at the guy and gripped his Colt tighter . <p> " I detest unnecessary violence , " the man said . <p> A chill ran up Robert 's spine as he got the impression this guy probably considered most violence " necessary . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached into his coat . <p> " Careful , buddy , " Welmann growled . " Two fingers . " <p> The man nodded . He plucked out a business card and held it out to Robert . <p> Big guys like this were n't usually fast . So why did Robert imagine one of those massive hands grabbing him lightning quick and snapping his neck like Styrofoam ? <p> Robert snatched the card . <p> On one side there were letters so black they did n't look like ink , but darkness coalesced . It took Robert a second to focus on them . <p> Mr. Uri Crumble <p> On the reverse side was a holographic logo . The ink was red-black and did n't look quite dry . Robert smelled blood , thick like a slaughterhouse . This odor stuck to the back of his throat and he gagged . He could n't focus on the design : lines and tiny symbols that stretched into the air and deeper into the card . <p> Welmann hissed so loud that Robert swore he felt it on the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the card to him . <p> Welmann took one look at the thing and muttered , " Oh , hell . " He lowered his aim a notch and carefully looked over Mr. Crumble . <p> " Indeed . " Crumble puffed on his cigarette . <p> Welmann rubbed his face with his free hand . His ruddy cheeks drained of color as he holstered his gun . <p> Robert had never seen Welmann look scared and never seen him lower his gun . He was a gladiator  --  kill or be killed  --  it was genetically hardwired into him . Now suddenly Welmann looked like a little boy with his hand slapped . <p> And this Crumble , what was his deal ? Sure he was the size of a bull ox , but nobody , not even someone that size , stared down the muzzle of a .357 Magnum without so much as a blink . <p> It was as if all the fundamentals that Robert had learned were being rewritten . <p> " What are you people doing here ? " Welmann asked . <p> Crumble flashed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Same as you , Driver . " <p> Welmann opened his mouth to say something , then shut it with a click . <p> No one was supposed to know who they were ... or what Welmann was . <p> " Your so-called car , " Crumble explained , " parked in the alley . Such a vehicle with its modifications , here , tonight , could only belong to an errand boy . " <p> He meant Welmann 's 2005 Mercedes Maybach Exelero , the thing he prized more than his immortal soul . The one-of-a-kind four-door version had been handcrafted and purred with a twin-turbocharged V-12 that cranked out seven hundred horses . The Exelero was armored and fitted with bulletproof glass . The interior was butter-soft leather and koa wood . Outside she was sculpted mirror-chrome steel and black enamel so deep she made midnight jealous . <p> " You said you were looking for someone ? " Welmann asked . <p> Mr. Uri Crumble nodded toward the filing cabinets on the far wall . One had its lock popped . " What was your interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental note of " them . " His and Welmann 's current mission was to dig up information on one missing little old lady : Audrey Post . There was no " them . " <p> Robert glanced at Welmann . He had on his poker face , but he 'd bet Welmann was thinking the same thing . <p> Robert looked back to Crumble and noticed his cigarette was n't burning . Well , it was ; it smoldered and smoke curled from the tip . . . but there was no ash and it was the same length as when he 'd first stepped from the shadows . <p> Crumble pulled a long drag from the curious never-and-ever-burning cigarette and caught Robert 's stare . He exhaled , saying , " Perhaps we should share what we know and learn more . " <p> Welmann frowned and adopted his best stupid , noir-detective act . " Buddy , you 're speaking Greek , and I barely understand English . " <p> Crumble grunted smoke . " Very well . " He moved to the door , brushing aside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty cardboard box . Crumble paused and said , " After you report your failure tonight , your employers will not be pleased . " He chuckled , the sound a subsonic ripple . " Keep my card . Give us a call . Our organization always has a use for qualified people . " <p> " That 'll be the day , " Welmann replied . <p> " Yes . . . it will . " Crumble turned sideways to fit through the office doorway and left . <p> Robert noticed he was holding his breath , so he exhaled . What did he mean by " report your failure " ? This guy did hallway . " Gone , " he said , and closed the door . He moved quickly to the filing <p> cabinets . <p> Robert saw the one with the popped lock was labeled pa  --  po . <p> " That 's who we 're looking for , right ? Post ? Probably the same old lady . " <p> Welmann ignored the question and reached for the handle . He recoiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better look . <p> Welmann grabbed a handkerchief from his pocket and pulled the drawer . Smoke and plumes of sparks flew into the air . The files inside had been reduced to a pile of smoldering ash . <p> He slammed it shut . <p> Welmann glared about the office and nodded at the computers . " Get to work , kid . " <p> Robert understood that now was not the time to ask questions . He moved from desk to desk , feeling the aluminum cases of the desktop units . " Got a warm one , " he told Welmann . He sat and booted the machine . <p> Welmann hovered over Robert 's shoulder , as if he did n't trust him to turn on a computer . <p> A blue screen flashed on the monitor . <p> " BIOS setup , " Welmann muttered . " The drive has been wiped . " <p> " So let 's pull it , take it back , and scan it . " <p> " Do n't bother . When those guys erase something , it stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shudder . He got the feeling that hard drives were n't the only things Crumble " erased . " <p> " Who was that guy ? " <p> " Works for another side , " Welmann replied . <p> " What other side ? " Robert turned around . " I thought our boss and the others did n't have sides . " <p> Welmann scrunched his lips into a single white line . " I do n't got all the answers , kid , but there are others . There 's a truce between his people and ours . No one sticks their noses into each other 's business . Capisce ? " <p> " So this Crumble guy was n't exactly what he appeared to be ? " <p> Welmann shrugged , which meant yes , and said , " We got to be careful not to get caught between some big wheels . Might get ground to a pulp . " His gaze moved from desk to desk . He got up and felt under the top of one . With a rip he pulled free a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert . " Lawyers always keep backups . " <p> Robert wheeled his chair to a nearby computer and snapped it on . He spotted a sticky note on the monitor with the password and typed it in . He then inserted the disk , and scrolled through the list of folders that flashed on-screen . <p> " ' Post , ' " Robert said . " There 's a file on her ... no , wait . For ' Post , F and E. ' " He looked back through the folders . " No Audrey Post , boss . Sorry . " <p> " Open the file , " Welmann suggested , and pulled up a chair next to Robert 's . <p> Robert did as he was told and legal gobbledygook crawled over the monitor . After skimming a few pages he got the gist of it . " Trust-fund stuff . Some rich kids getting money from their great-grandmother . Blind accounts in the Caymans , Geneva  --  all over the world . Lucky brats . Not who we 're looking for , though . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neanderthal scowl melted as he donned wire-rimmed reading glasses . He hit the page down key a few times . <p> " No , " Welmann muttered . " Crumble said ' them ' . . . that he was looking for ' them . ' What else do you have on "  --  he tapped the page up key thrice  --  " Fiona and Eliot Post ? " <p> Robert tabbed back to the file folders . " Got a missing-kid kit . One of those jobs you can fill out and give to the police if little Johnny and Jane here ever get lost in the woods . " <p> " Let 's see it . " <p> On screen two photos appeared : one of a teenage boy , the other a girl . The pictures were head-and-shoulder shots with strong light and a dappled background . The subjects had forced smiles snapped at the precise wrong moment . <p> The boy was a few years younger than Robert , with black hair cut short and combed to either side . The kid had a deer-in-the-headlights expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The girl looked as clueless as the boy ; she had dark hair tied back in a ratty ponytail , no makeup , and a pimple on her chin . Her eyes had the same nanve gleam , and Robert thought of another word : prissy . <p> Robert checked their data sheets . Twin brother and sister , Fiona and Eliot . Robert memorized their address . Their birthdays , he noted , were tomorrow . . . actually today as it was three in the morning . <p> Welmann folded his glasses and put them away . He stared into the distance . " More than fifteen years , " he whispered . " That how long our little old lady has been missing . " He looked back at the pictures and squinted . " Has got to be the most cocked-up . . . " <p> Welmann 's face turned ash white . <p> " What is it ? " Robert asked . <p> " You got their address ? " <p> Robert tapped the side of his head . <p> Welmann opened the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in half . <p> " Hey ! What gives ? " <p> Welmann turned to Robert , and his face set in a cast-iron mask of nocrap-listen-to-me-kid seriousness . <p> " I want you to get back to the boss and report everything : Crumble , these kids , give him their address . Do it in person . No phones . " Welmann stood . " We got trouble two steps behind us . You drive and do n't stop . You got to eat , drink , or piss  --  you suck it up and keep going . " <p> " Okay . " Robert was n't sure what had just set Welmann off , but he was n't about to question orders when they had gone to DEFCON 2 . " What are you going to do ? " <p> " I 've got to get to those kids . . . before they do . " <p> " You mean Crumble . This other side , right ? " <p> Annoyance flickered over Welmann 's wide face and he got out Mr. Uri Crumble 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and blinked as if it hurt to look at the card so closely . He fished out his lighter , struck a flame , and touched it to the paper . <p> The flame caught . Welmann dropped the card . <p> Fire licked up the lines , flickered around the angular writing , and covered the logo on the back ; white blackened to char , edges curled and glowed with embers ; the pattern wriggled in the heat as if it were alive . <p> Five seconds it burned . Then ten seconds , and it continued to burn . The lines looked like heated metal and glowed brighter , and Robert found himself wanting to touch it . . . let it sear into his skin . <p> Welmann stomped it flat , and ash plumed over the floor . <p> Nothing remained except a sneaker imprint of pulverized cinders . Try as he might , Robert could n't remember the curious design , even though he had just seen it . <p> " Freaky , " Robert whispered . <p> Welmann reached into his pocket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . <p> Robert stared at them . No way was Welmann handing him the keys to the Maybach . <p> " Go on , " Welmann said . <p> He did n't have to say it twice . Robert snatched them up . " You want me to drive ? " <p> Welmann looked slightly nauseated , but nodded . <p> Robert 's elation faded . Welmann would n't let him drive unless it had really hit the fan , as in , Welmann did n't expect to be able to drive the thing again  --  ever . <p> " Take me with you , " Robert whispered . " You 'll need backup . " <p> Welmann nodded . " I bet I will . But you 're not coming . " He exhaled and looked Robert square in the eyes . " You got twice the balls that I had when I was sixteen . You 're going to make a great Driver . " He set a hand on Robert 's shoulder and squeezed . " But if you do n't do as I told you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert wanted to say a lot of things : how Welmann was a son of a bitch , that he never liked him ... and that the last thing he wanted was to leave him the way he had the string of replacement dads since he was a kid . <p> He fought to keep his eyes from watering . He was going to cry ? Like a baby ? In front of Welmann ? He fought back the tears and nodded . <p> Robert moved to the door and paused . <p> Welmann flashed him a crooked smile and gave him a little wave that turned into a " shooing-away " motion . <p> Robert wondered when he 'd see the guy who 'd been the closest thing he 'd had to a father . . . or even if he 'd see him again . He sprinted down the hallway to the stairwell and did n't look back . He had a feeling they were both on their own . <p> 5 <p> BIRTHDAY SURPRISES <p> Eliot reviewed his escape plan : When he got paid today , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd get to Santa Rosa and hitchhike the rest of the way to San Francisco , where he 'd arrange to work on a freighter to Shanghai ... and from there maybe find his way to Tibet . He glanced at the clock on his dresser : almost nine thirty . Time for the real world . There was no escape plan . Eliot did n't have the nerve to hitchhike or con his way onto a freighter . He wished he did , though . He got angry . Jeez , if he could n't even escape in his daydreams , what was the point of anything ? He marched over to the milk crate by his dresser , stood on it , and looked in the mirror . He winced . Today he had to wear his " special " clothes . The ones Cecilia had spent considerable time and energy sewing for his birthday . As with her cooking , Cecilia 's heart was in the right place , but the results could almost kill you . Eliot 's shirt was a collection of stripes that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died the fashion death they richly deserved . Avocado , almond , and burnt orange had been put on this planet specifically to clash . He would n't have minded so much , but the alignment was off , so they offset midway on his chest . The pants were no better . Cecilia had decided pleats were " in , " and these permanent creases bunched together around the zipper so it looked as if he wore a diaper . He sighed , closed his eyes , and hoped he 'd be invisible at work today . . . or that Mike would be too busy to harass him . <p> His daydream of escape returned , and for a moment he tasted salt air on the Indian Ocean  --  the start of a great adventure . <p> The clock on his dresser pinged . <p> He hopped off the milk crate and went to grab his homework , halting at his desk . There was no homework . <p> It felt good , but somehow wrong , not to have fallen asleep at his desk last night . Grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night she had said " no homework . " Yet , everything about last night seemed wrong : Cecilia acting jumpy ; him and Fiona sent to bed early ; that broken teacup . <p> Maybe the change was because of their birthdays . Grandmother had to realize that they 'd soon be too old for homeschooling . What was she going to do when they went to college ? Grandmother and Cee would be left alone to rattle around in this book-lined tomb of an apartment . He felt sorry for them . <p> Eliot moved to his door . <p> The List was taped there , 106 rules that might as well have been 106 feet of chain-link fencing and concertina wire . Every bit of the sympathy he had just felt for Grandmother evaporated . <p> He wanted to tear the List down , rip it into confetti . . . but the rules would still be there  --  invisible and ever present , essential to life in Grandmother 's house , like oxygen in the air . <p> And such tantrums did nothing . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for news he 'd claimed . He promised there 'd be no music . He had tried pleading , logic , and finally he had told Grandmother that he would buy a radio , and he did n't need her permission . <p> Grandmother did n't say a word . Instead , she halted his tirade with a single " sharp " gaze . <p> It was the same look she had last night . He 'd forgotten that he had been on the receiving end of that look . It had felt as if his heart had stopped . . . not literally , but he recalled that he 'd forgotten to breathe he 'd been so absorbed by her fathomless gray eyes . <p> After what had seemed like minutes , Grandmother blinked , and he inhaled . <p> The " discussion " about his radio was over . Forever . <p> Angry all over again  --  Eliot yanked open his bedroom door . <p> In the darkened hallway Fiona 's door yanked open at the same time , with exactly the same force , spilling another dim parallelogram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one another , then she said , " Happy birthday . " <p> She was doing it again : that pretend twin synchronicity thing to bug him . One day he 'd figure out how she did it . <p> Eliot 's anger dimmed a little , though , as he recalled her present last night : the chocolate . Now that he thought about it , it was twice the gift that he had realized . He liked chocolate as much as the next person , but Fiona loved the stuff . How could one person be so nice one moment , then a total brat the next ? Guess that was the short definition of a sister . <p> At least she had n't escaped fashion disaster , either . Fiona also wore her Cecilia-made birthday outfit : a pink dress , misaligned at the seams , tight across the chest , and loose at the waist . A pink bow and sash about her middle cinched it awkwardly together . And a pair of white sneakers from the secondhand store had been colored with lavender marker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crumpled bubble-gum wrapper . <p> Fiona tried to smooth out the wrinkles and bunches in the fabric to no effect . She shot him a glare and said , " What are you staring at ? Are you feeling okay ? Hypoxia ? Or anoxia ? " <p> " I 'm getting plenty of oxygen to my brain . " <p> Fiona had been favoring medical terms in her openers for vocabulary insult . Good thing he had reviewed the premed texts on the bathroom shelves recently . <p> " You should switch from angiology to a field of study closer to your mental consistency , " Eliot retorted . " Limacology . " <p> Fiona 's dark brows scrunched together . <p> He had her with this one . The ology part  --  " study of "  --  was a give-me . The lima though ... that would get her . Even by their standards it was obscure . This would be one of the shortest games of vocabulary insult on record . <p> Eliot left her there to ponder his riddle and strolled down the hall , practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " A lubricious puzzle from your equally slippery gray matter . " <p> Eliot stopped . The grin on his face faded . She got it ? So quick ? <p> He turned . " How ? " <p> Eliot closed his mouth , but it was too late . The damage had been done . He 'd committed the one foul in vocabulary insult : asking for an explanation . <p> It was Fiona 's turn to smile . She tilted her head and explained , " You had me for a second . I thought it was lemma as in the Greek for ' proposition , ' as in dilemma , the decision between two propositions . " <p> She was lecturing him . He loathed this but it was her right to claim  --  the only real prize in their game . <p> " But it was your clue about ' mental consistency ' that really helped . I figured it had to be something slimy or sticky . . . which made me remember that Limax maximus is the leopard or common garden slug . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Limacology , the study of slugs . Good one . I hope you were n't saving it for a special occasion . " <p> " Whatever , " Eliot mumbled . " Score 's still nothing to nothing . " <p> She caught up to him , and together they walked into the dining room . They stopped on the threshold , however , stunned by what they saw . <p> The table , normally obscured with a layer of papers and books , had been cleared . The wood surface was polished to a dark mirror finish and draped with a lace tablecloth ( that did n't fit ) . Four china plates were set out with linen place mats , napkins , and silver forks . <p> Across the picture window , a banner hung between the bookcases . It had been taped together from newspaper strips . On it , a laundry marker had been used to print happy birthday . The last few letters , though , shrank at the end as the calligrapher had run out of room . <p> Only there were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cecilia had made them cards last year . Each had tiny silhouettes of their faces on the outside , cut with exacting precision from black cardboard . Eliot could n't imagine how Cee had done it with her trembling hands . It must have taken her forever . <p> Grandmother , however , had taken the cards and they 'd never seen them again . She had said it violated RULE 11 . <p> RULE 11:No painting , sketching , drawing , doodling , sculpting , papiermGchT , or anything in any way attempting to re-create nature or abstract themes with artistic methods ( traditional , modern , electronic , or postmodern " interpretive " ) . <p> That was the " no arts and crafts " rule . <br> Did n't this banner count ? <br> Beyond the swinging door to the kitchen , Eliot heard humming and detected the odors of baking bread , caramelized sugar , and citrus wafting into the room . Cee was cooking . <p> He glanced down the hallway . No one had yet seen him . He could dart back to his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work  --  before he had to eat whatever " special treat " Cee had whipped up for them . <p> Fiona set her hand on his arm and whispered , " Do n't . She tries so hard . " <p> He exhaled . Cee did try ... and he loved her for it . He would n't disappoint her . <p> The kitchen door swung inward and diminutive Cecilia backed into the room . Today she wore her good white dress with lace cuffs and petticoats that rustled under the wide skirt . She turned and they saw the triple-layer strawberry shortcake in her withered hands . She beamed at them and set it unsteadily on the table . <p> Cee was a sweet old lady , but her sense of smell and taste had dried up sometime around the Second World War , and as a result the things she cooked could taste like anything : limes , sea salt , or with equal probability Worcestershire sauce . <p> " Happy birthday , my darlings . " She presented her culinary creation with a flourish . " I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for you . " Cecilia shuffled closer and hugged Fiona and Eliot together . <p> " Thanks , Cee , " they said . <p> She released them . " Oh , dear , " she whispered . " I forgot the pineapple and walnuts . And the candles ! Stay right there . " She trundled back into the kitchen . <p> Eliot and Fiona stared at the cake . It was lopsided . <p> " You try it , " he whispered . <p> " No way . It 's your turn . " <p> Eliot sighed and took a tiny step closer . Pink and purple icing oozed from the cake 's layers . From the lower edge he scooped a fingerful . <p> The icing was gritty . Strawberry seeds ? The cake part had the spongy consistency of cake . . . but you could never be too careful with Cecilia 's cooking . He smelled it : citrus and something else his nose could n't identify . <p> He braced himself and popped the bite into his mouth  --  quickly before he chickened out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds . It tasted good , tangy and sugary the way it ought to be . . . but then the icing melted , and his face involuntarily puckered . The cake was salty and sour : unmixed baking soda and a chunk of orange peel . <p> Cecilia pushed through the kitchen door with two bowls balanced on one arm , and a fistful of birthday candles and a box of matches in the other . <p> Eliot had no choice . He swallowed and smiled . <p> " Can I give you a hand ? " Fiona offered . <p> " No , no , no . " Cecilia shook the box of matches at her . " Just stay there while I finish . No cheating and eating . " She dealt slices of pineapple onto the cake and sprinkled crushed walnuts over that . She then punctured the frosting skin with candles , carefully counting out thirty . Fifteen for Eliot . Fifteen for Fiona . <p> Cecilia could have skimped and just put one set of candles on the cake , but she was always trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved . <p> " Thank you , " Fiona said . <p> " Yeah , " Eliot added , clearing his esophagus as best he could . " Thanks , Cee . " <p> " Now fire . " She slid open the box of matches , fumbled one out , and struck it with a shaking hand . The flame reflected in her dark eyes . <p> Eliot said , " Maybe you better  --  " <p> " Let me do it , " a voice behind them commanded . <p> Eliot and Fiona turned together as Grandmother entered the room . <p> " Good morning , Grandmother , " they said in unison . <p> Grandmother looked different today . Her short silver hair had been brushed to a silk sheen . She wore a red linen shirt with a button-down collar , khaki explorer pants , and midcalf black boots that were a shade less severe than the combat boots she usually favored . <p> She smiled at Eliot and Fiona , then glanced at the banner over the window . She said nothing and strode toward Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Grandmother snatched it from her hand and quickly touched it to all thirty candles , lighting them . The match burned perilously close to her fingers , until she rolled it , squeezing the fire to a hissing ember . <p> " There , " Grandmother said . " Now both of you wish for happy tidings . " <p> Eliot mentally chalked off another year when there would be no singing " Happy Birthday " thanks to RULE 34 . <p> Eliot and Fiona stepped up to the cake and leaned closer , inhaling at the same time . <p> They shot a quick look at each other . He knew Fiona was wishing for more chocolate . <p> Eliot wished for a stereo , guitar lessons , and rock-concert tickets . This was more like " praying for a miracle " than a " birthday wish , " but what the heck ; it was worth a shot . <p> They both closed their eyes , blew for all they were worth , and extinguished every flame . <p> " Very good , " Grandmother said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their faces from Grandmother 's antique windup film camera . <p> " One next to the cake , please , " she told them . " Together . " <p> Eliot and Fiona scooted closer  --  even though this violated their mutually agreed-on one-foot minimum distance from each other . <p> Cecilia sidled next to Eliot and put her arm around him . <p> Grandmother frowned . " Not you , Cecilia . I only have two shots left on this roll of film . We ca n't waste any . " <p> " I 'm sorry . " Cecilia backed into the corner . <p> Eliot forced a smile as Grandmother snapped the shot . <p> As if she could manufacture the perfect family if she got enough photos and stuck them in an album . Funny , now that Eliot thought about it : Grandmother 's assertion that all the pictures of their parents had sunk on that ocean liner did n't ring true . She was always taking pictures of them . Why did n't she have any pictures of her own daughter ? <p> Cecilia reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grandmother said . She went to the china cabinet , whose shelves were filled with volumes of St. Hawthorn 's Collected Reference of Horticulture , and pulled out four paper bags.5 <p> This was different . Usually Fiona and Eliot got a single present each . <p> Grandmother set the bags on the table . They had been stapled shut . Her wrapping was n't much in the way of festive , but it was effective . <p> If Eliot did n't already know they contained clothes ( what they got every year ) , he 'd never have been able to guess . <p> She handed one bag to Eliot and one to Fiona . <p> 5 . St. Hawthorn 's Collected Reference of Horticulture ( complete title on the inside page reads St. Hawthorn 's Collected Reference of Horticulture in the New World and Beyond ) . This nineteenth-century manuscript catalogs many plant species not found in the modern world . Many scholars claim such entries as the " Venom Creepvine of Louisiana " are pure invention . Others speculate these might now be extinct species . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they sold for 40,000 . Victor Golden , Golden 's Guide to Extraordinary Books ( Oxford : 1958 ) . <p> He hefted his : heavier than he expected , too dense to be a new shirt or slacks . Fiona held hers up , and one brow rose in puzzlement . <p> " Go ahead , " Grandmother said , the slightest enthusiasm creeping into her voice . " Open them . " <p> Eliot tore into the bag . <p> Inside , wrapped in a plastic sleeve , was an old book . <p> He hid his disappointment as best he could . When you lived in an apartment filled with thousands of books , the only thing less wanted than hand-me-down clothes was another book . <p> This one had a scuffed green leather cover and three ridges across the spine . As Eliot turned it over , he saw in faded gilt letters The Time Machine by H. G. Wells . <p> He glanced at Fiona , and she stared with mouth agape at the book in her hands : From the Earth to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While the apartment was full of books , they were moldy century-old plays , desiccated histories , thick science textbooks , and biographies of people no one had ever cared about . <p> The book in his hand was ... forbidden . <p> There was RULE 55 , the no-made-up rule . <p> " These are classics , " Grandmother explained . She set one slender hand on each of their shoulders to reassure them . " Not first editions , but still printed in the nineteenth century , so take good care of them . " <p> Eliot marveled at his book . He 'd seen this novel referenced in commentaries on great literature . He knew the basic premise . It was something he 'd never had before : a science-fiction story he could escape into . <p> And if H. G. Wells was considered a " classic , " did that mean Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe were up for grabs , too ? <p> Eliot looked into Grandmother 's eyes to see if she was serious , that this was for real . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he liked her gift ... and oddly a little worried , too . <p> " This is great , " he said . " Super . Thanks a lot . " <p> " Thank you , Grandmother , " Fiona said . She held her Jules Verne to her chest . <p> Grandmother 's thin lips parted in a restrained smile . " You 're quite welcome . This is a special year for you two . You 're growing up faster than I ever imagined . " <p> " Cake anyone ? " Cecilia said . <p> Grandmother turned to her and narrowed her eyes . <p> " I ... I just thought , " Cecilia whispered , " it might be a good time to eat ? " <p> Grandmother considered , then said , " Yes , go get a knife , please . " <p> Cecilia nodded and ambled into the kitchen . <p> " Now , " Grandmother said , " you should open your other present before you go to work . " <p> Eliot exchanged a glance with his sister . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy , and now two gifts ? <p> He was n't going to ask questions . Too many questions irritated Grandmother , and her good moods were as fleeting as a rainbow in a hurricane . <p> Eliot grabbed the second paper bag . It was light and soft . It had to be clothes . <p> Cecilia returned carrying a stack of extra napkins , and a long chef 's knife from the butcher 's block . She set everything neatly on the table . She gazed lovingly at Eliot and Fiona . <p> " Well , go ahead , " Grandmother said to her , irritated at this delay , then raised her camera to take another snapshot . " Cut the cake while the children  --  " <p> There was a knock at the front door . Three strong raps . <p> Grandmother frowned and the temperature in the apartment seemed to plummet ten degrees . <p> Cecilia paused , knife held over the cake . " Should I get that ? " <p> " No . " Grandmother lowered the camera and slowly turned . " Whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Eliot looked at Fiona , and she looked at him , shaking her head . Only one thing was worse than provoking Grandmother 's anger , and that was finding her in a good mood and then provoking her . Whoever was at the door ... Eliot pitied the poor guy . <p> 6 <p> TRAIL OF BREAD CRUMBS <p> Marcus Welmann thought the cinder-block apartment building was odd . Its second floor was shorter than the first floor by two feet . He paused to catch his breath on the stairwell landing and noticed the third story was shorter still , as if the place were shrinking . He rubbed his face . He had to figure out why this Uri Crumble was so interested in the Post kids ... and what the connection was to the lady he was looking for : Audrey Post . The building that matched the address in the lawyer 's file had been painted brown to look like wood ( it did n't ) and had a quaint Bavarian fatade out front . Just the kind of tacky you 'd expect in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post on the mailboxes in the lobby , however , so he decided to try the building manager to see if he could get a forwarding address . Welmann went up the steps and marched down the hallway to the manager 's apartment , 3A . Digging into his pocket , he grabbed his fake police shield . He then checked his Colt Python in its holster . He paused to make himself presentable  --  as much as anyone could in camo sweatpants and a black T-shirt . He zipped up his light polyester jacket . He knocked , three times , hard , like a cop in a hurry . Welmann waited and shifted his weight . He hoped Robert made it back to the boss , and that the Mercedes was in one unscratched piece . <p> The kid had a good head , but there was too much " rebel " in Robert . He 'd wash out of Driver 's training , which might be a good thing . Sixteen-year-old boys ought to worry about " kid " stuff : sex , drugs , and rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welmann heard footsteps and saw the peephole go dark . The door opened without the usual unlocking of dead bolts and unlatching of security chains . <p> He puffed up his chest and furrowed his brow . He 'd need a good head of steam to blow at this manager  --  impress upon him that withholding a forwarding address would be obstructing justice . He looked up , fake shield in hand ... but the bluster stalled in his throat . <p> The woman who answered was tall . How old ? Fifty ? Sixty ? Hard to say . A mature woman , but with looks like hers , she could have been on magazine covers . Her cropped silver hair was elegant , and Welmann easily imagined her as the femme fatale in his favorite noir flicks . <p> " Can I help you ? " she asked , studying him like a smear of dog poop on her boot . <p> Welmann had that elevator-going-down feeling  --  just enough to throw off his equilibrium . <p> He glanced into the apartment . There were a billion books : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat piles . They were real books , too , with leather and gilt letters ; not a TV Guide in sight . <p> Whatever was bugging him , he did n't see it . . . but he felt it : his skin itched and he fidgeted . There was something dangerous here . <p> " I 'm looking for  --  " <p> Then he spotted them : at the end of the hall , sitting at a table , were Eliot and Fiona Post . They blinked at him with the same deer-in-theheadlights look as in their photographs . <p> The uneasy elevator feeling in Welmann halted  --  as the elevator snapped , and his stomach leapt into his throat . <p> He connected the dots . The manager in 3A . Post kids in 3A . No Post on the mailboxes because they were being hidden by the woman who stood in front of him . The woman he 'd been trying to track down : Audrey Post . <p> Welmann looked into her gray eyes and only then really saw her . <p> He could n't pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the shadowy illusion printed on Crumble 's business card , either . This was the roar of the ocean surf , an inexorable tide that sucked him deeper . <p> He was drowning . Could n't breathe . <p> " Looking for what ? " she asked . " Mister ... ? " <p> His trance broke and he found his voice . " Welmann , " he whispered , and cleared his throat . " Marcus Welmann . " He gave her a slight bow , which was the jerkiest thing he 'd done in a long time . Somehow , though , it felt like the only thing to do . <p> Her gaze hardened and she opened the door wider . " Come in , Mr. Welmann . " <p> When his boss had given Welmann this mission , he had been crystal clear : find Audrey Post , report back , and do not under any circumstances engage . <p> Here he was engaging . <p> Welmann could sort this out  --  but he 'd have to talk his way out of it . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post led him inside . <p> He smelled something baking and the overpowering scent from the molding pages of all those books . <p> He saw a very old woman in the dining room , hovering over the children . She wore what might have been a costume from Gone with the Wind and looked ancient enough to have worn it during a real Civil War cotillion . She glared at him . <p> The boy and girl clutched books in their laps , and they stared at Welmann with that mix of annoyance and curiosity that was pure teenager . <p> Behind them , draped over the window , was a banner with happy birthday on it . Marcus was interrupting in a big , awkward way . <p> Good investigative technique  --  barging into the middle of these kids ' party . Nice and inconspicuous , he thought . Still , better him than Crumble . <p> " Children , " Audrey Post said , " this is Mr. Welmann , an old friend of the family . " <p> Welmann slipped the fake police shield back into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing another game , one where he did n't understand the rules . Best go along for now . <p> The boy and girl exchanged looks and then stared at him . They were a year or two younger than Robert . <p> " Friend of the family ? " Fiona leaned forward . " Did you know our parents , sir ? " <p> " Shush , " Audrey Post told her . " Go  --  you 're late for work , both of you . " Her voice softened a bit and she added , " We 'll finish this later . I have business with this gentleman . " <p> Both kids glanced at some paper bags on the table , then said together , " Yes , Grandmother . " They rose , nodded at Welmann , and retreated into the shadows of the apartment . <p> So Ms. Audrey Post was their grandmother . That made sense . Welmann listened , but detected no one else in the apartment . Where were the kids ' mom and dad ? Parents normally did n't miss birthdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had known her parents . As in past tense . As in dead now . <p> Audrey Post turned to the old woman and said , " Cecilia , bring tea , please . " <p> The older woman hesitated , opened her mouth as if to tell her something , but then backed into the kitchen , all the time watching Welmann . <p> The children reappeared and headed for the front door with lunch sacks . They each gave their grandmother a polite kiss on the cheek . <p> " It was nice to meet you , Mr. Welmann , " Fiona said . <p> " Nice to meet you , too , " he said . <p> Sweet kid . Polite . You did n't see that much anymore today . All the more reason to figure this out and move them somewhere safe from Crumble . <p> The kids left and closed the apartment door behind them . <p> " Now , " Audrey Post said , " we will talk . " <p> Welmann felt his equilibrium shift a few degrees more . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have preferred a mano a mano with Mr. Uri Crumble . That would have been a lot safer . Audrey Post had power ; any person with a blink of the sight could see that . <p> " You were sent to find me ? " <p> Welmann was n't stupid enough to lie . " Yes , ma'am . " <p> " You are a Driver , correct ? " <p> She could have picked up that cake , candles and all , and smashed it into his face , and that would have been less of a surprise . <p> Welmann felt an instinctual urge to take a few steps backward , but he held his ground , steeled himself , and nodded . <p> If she knew he was a Driver , and more important what a Driver was , then it followed that she knew his boss and probably why he was interested in her . . . which was more than he 'd been told . <p> She did n't look the least bit worried about any of this , either . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowed a bit . <p> Welmann swallowed , his throat bone-dry . So she did n't know everything . Good . The clairvoyant ones were always a pain in the ass . <p> " They said not to talk to you . " <p> Audrey Post cocked her head as if listening for something , then glanced out the window to the street below . Marcus looked , too . <p> The kids appeared on the sidewalk . She turned back to him . " Do you know who I am ? " <p> Was that a trick question ? " Audrey Post , " he offered . <p> This seemed to be the right thing because she smiled . It was a nice smile , and Welmann found himself relaxing a notch . He shook off that creeping complacency . He had to keep his guard up . This was n't a game . <p> She eased into one of the seats at the dining table as gracefully as a lotus blossom settling onto a reflecting pool . <p> " Please "  --  she gestured to the opposite chair  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman , was no idiot . You did n't stand when a lady of power offered you a place at her table . He sat and the chair creaked from his generous frame . <p> The kitchen door swung inward , and the old woman backed into the dining room holding a tray with tea service . <p> She set it on the table and whispered , " Why are you talking to him ? " She scowled at Welmann , then made a throat-slitting motion . <p> Welmann liked this full-of-venom little old lady . He quashed his chuckles , though ; she was n't kidding . Sweat trickled down his sides . <p> " The tea will be all , Cecilia . " <p> Cecilia 's gaze dropped to the floor . " Yes , yes , of course . " She stepped back into the kitchen . <p> " How did you find me , Mr. Welmann ? " Audrey Post asked . <p> " Your grandchildren . " <p> Her eyes became slits and her lips compressed to a single line . <p> That struck a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids ? Maybe that was the card to play . " Eliot and Fiona , " he said , " ages fifteen , twins . " <p> Her delicate jaw clenched . He was definitely on the right track . <p> " My employer respects you . You two should talk . " Welmann reached into his jacket for his cell phone . <p> " Put that down . " <p> Welmann 's hand immediately obeyed and dropped the phone . That was a nice trick . Audrey Post had the juice all right . <p> " Look . " He leaned forward . " I 'm just a Driver , but if you 're in trouble , I can talk to them for you . " <p> She closed her eyes . " So sincere , " she whispered . " That is sweet . But your employer and the rest of his family  --  I need not their favor , tolerance , or permission to do anything . " <p> Welmann did n't get that . People did n't come to his boss 's interest unless they merited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do very well . <p> " How , precisely , " she said , " did you discover the children ? " <p> Welmann was no genius , but the lightbulb finally flicked on in his head . Were the kids what this game of cat and mouse between all the players was about ? Sure , he 'd been sent after the grandmother , but maybe  --  as impossible as this sounded  --  his boss had n't known about the two kids . <p> He knew the smell of pay dirt , though , and those kids were it . <p> Welmann sipped his tea , chamomile in bone china . He was a black-coffee guy , but this was nice , too . It served as a much needed pause while he studied her and figured this all out . <p> Audrey Post shifted in her seat , her feathers ruffled . <p> " I did n't find out nothing . A guy named Uri Crumble did the legwork . " <p> One of her eyebrows arched . " Crumble ? Another Driver ? " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works for my people . " <p> Her smooth olive complexion paled and her lips parted in astonishment . <p> Apparently Audrey Post had a clue whom Crumble worked for , too . And if they were half as nasty as he heard they were , he could use that to flip her to his side . <p> " These are not guys you want to mess around with . They do n't exactly play by rules . " <p> She drew her hands together in a steeple . " Of course . . . " Her gaze drifted far away , deep in thought . <p> If Welmann had any advantage , he had to press it now . Make a connection with her and get her to trust him  --  for her own good . Sure , she had power ; anyone could sense that . But no one had enough power to tangle with Crumble 's pals . . . or for that matter his boss . <p> " You and your grandkids are in danger , " he said with genuine concern . " I can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I know they can , " she whispered . She blinked rapidly , reached for her teacup , and sipped . She then stared into the bottom as if she could read the dregs . <p> The moment stretched into a vacuum of uncomfortable silence . <p> " Not to be rude or anything , " Welmann said , " but time is running out . With Crumble involved , the sooner we move the better . " <p> Audrey Post snapped out of her fugue and looked up . <p> She reached for a plate , picked up the eight-inch knife , and sliced the cake . " Would you like a piece , Mr. Welmann ? Cecilia 's cooking usually leaves something to be desired , but today she 's made an effort . " <p> Whatever connection Welmann thought he had made a second ago was gone . " I do n't  --  " <p> " Understand ? " A wry smile crept across her features . " This is , undoubtedly , for the best . " <p> The danger he had felt before came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassuring weight of his PT-145 ; he shifted forward , opening a gap between the chair and his spine so he could quickly draw his Colt Python if necessary . <p> Audrey Post inhaled deeply . " As you said , time is a consideration . " She wiped the frosting off the kitchen knife with a napkin . " Now , you need to go , Mr. Welmann . " <p> " If you do n't let me help you , they 'll find you . " <p> " ' They ' ? Which ' they , ' Driver ? " She pointed the knife 's tip at his heart . " I think ' they ' have already found me . You would have never come here without reporting in , would you ? " <p> He stood , held up his hands in a universal nonthreatening gesture , and took a step toward the door . " Okay , lady . Take it easy . " <p> Welmann saw his reflection in her knife . That was bad luck . He was sweating so much now his shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There was no way she could reach across the table . And he had two guns . He had to get a grip and make as graceful an exit as possible . <p> " Maybe like you said , " he whispered . " I should go . " <p> " You must do as your nature dictates and serve your master . " She rose from her chair , still holding the knife . " As I must do as it is in my nature to do : protect my children . " <p> He suddenly smelled death in the room : the corpse-dry paper from all those books , a formaldehyde scent , and somewhere . . . blood . <p> Welmann drew his Colt Python and aimed at her center of mass . <p> Audrey Post did n't blink ; she did n't even look at the gun . She dimpled the cake with the tip of her blade . " You never said if you wanted cake . " <p> " What ? " Confused , he lowered his aim a notch . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said you needed to go . " She looked up , locking stares with him . " As in ' be removed . ' " <p> Instinct took over . It had saved his skin a dozen times before . <p> No thinking . The meat part of him knew to move before she spoke again , and the nerves in his arm and hand squeezed . <p> Welmann fired three times . <p> He blinked at the muzzle flash . <p> It took a split second for his vision to clear , and when it did , he saw a blur of steel arc at his throat . <p> No one could move that fast , not unless  --  <p> Audrey Post 's knife slashed through his carotid artery and severed his spine . <p> 7 <p> MORE BIRTHDAY SURPRISES <p> Fiona pushed through the side door of Oakwood Apartments . She paused on the sidewalk and tugged at her dress  --  pulling it down and across her torso  --  trying to straighten out the pink fabric . It had all bunched tighter during her sprint down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazed low in the sky . Fiona squinted at it and wished she could have worn shorts and a T-shirt today . Eliot banged through the door behind her . " No fair , " he panted . " You . . . took off before . . . done tying my shoes . " " I won . Get over it . " She frowned . " Who do you think that Mr. Welmann was ? " Eliot shook his head . " Grandmother said a ' friend of the family . ' But she 's never had any friends just drop by like that . " Grandmother , in fact , had no friends that either of them knew of . Fiona walked up Midway Avenue and Eliot fell in at her side . " You think he knew Mom or Dad ? " " Why else would we be hustled out so fast ? " she said . Opening old wounds , Fiona thought . That 's what Cecilia always told them when they brought up their parents . Thinking about the past when there was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking at a scab . But Fiona wanted to know something  --  anything  --  everything about her parents . They were this gigantic jigsaw puzzle , just waiting to be put together . . . only the entire box of pieces had been set on a shelf by Grandmother just out of her reach . <p> " Does it matter ? " she said . " What would it change if we heard a lousy story from that Welmann person ? " <p> " Nothing , " Eliot replied in a faraway voice . <p> She touched the slick , too shiny fabric of her birthday dress . It was poofy around her hips , corset-tight across her chest . She looked ridiculous . She glanced at Eliot : a collection of seething stripes . At least he 'd be in the kitchen where no one could see him . <p> Clouds crossed over the sun and a breeze stirred the leaves in the gutter . Fiona welcomed the shade . She flipped her hair off her neck , her skin already tacky with sweat . <p> Fiona concentrated , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her metronome-regular life : no homework last night ; the Jules Verne book Grandmother had given violating her own rule ; the broken teacup last night . . . <p> Cecilia 's hands always shook but she never dropped anything . At 104 years old , that blanking out could have been a stroke . Fiona could n't imagine life without her great-grandmother . More accurately , she could n't imagine life alone with Grandmother . <p> " You think she 's okay ? " Eliot asked . <p> " Cee ? Yeah . She 's a rock . " <p> " How 'd you know I meant her ? " Eliot asked irritated . <p> Fiona shrugged . " Just wondering about that busted teacup . " <p> " You saw how Grandmother looked at it ? " <p> How could you miss it ? Grandmother had stared at that cup with an intense laserlike focus . . . as if she were counting out the individual molecules in the ceramic shards . <p> Chill bumps rose on Fiona 's forearms , and the world seemed to tilt ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Eliot whispered . <p> Fiona did n't hear anything , though . It was as if someone had flipped a switch . No cars , no birds ; even the hum of the power lines overhead had ceased . <p> There was a thumping , however ; Fiona felt this rather than heard it , pulsing in the pit of her stomach . <p> Then tiny tinkling notes plunked over this , a jaunty rhythm just ahead : it echoed from the alleyway . <p> Eliot moved toward it , quickening his pace . <p> Fiona hurried to catch up  --  her disorientation increasing with every step . <p> She had the strangest urge to start skipping . As if she were a little girl and this was some extended game of hopscotch . <p> Eliot skidded to a halt at the alley 's entrance . <p> The old bum sat there , cross-legged , smiling , playing his violin . About him lay tiny envelopes with violin strings uncoiling from a few . He had no bow , so he had the instrument in his lap and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violin 's new strings with great flourish as if his fingers were tiny Cossack dancers . <p> Eliot stepped closer to get a better look  --  near enough so the old man could have reached out and grabbed him . <p> Fiona touched Eliot 's shoulder and gently tugged him back . She had wanted to yank him far from this bum , but she , too , felt like moving nearer , as if the sidewalk sloped precipitously toward the music , making it easy to move closer , harder to move away . Only her sisterly instinct to protect her brother held her back at all . <p> The old man looked up at them . His smile grew . The tempo of his tune increased . <p> The notes danced on the edges of her memory : a nursery rhyme . That was impossible because there were no nursery rhymes in Grandmother 's house . This was older , though , before Grandmother . A tune someone had murmured to her when she was a baby . <p> Sleep , little baby , dance in your dreams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill bumps on her arm were pebble hard . The music was the beat of her heart , the pulse of her blood ; it made her sway ; she tapped one foot . <p> Fiona smelled roses and freshly turned earth . She saw herself dancing around a whitewashed pole , colored ribbons about her , other children all laughing , singing , prancing round and round a maypole in an endless spiral.6,7 <p> 1 One legend regarding the Children 's Crusade of 1212 is of a German shepherd boy having a vision of Jesus dancing around a maypole . This led the boy to inspire thousands of other children to march to the Mediterranean , where they believed the sea would part and they would journey to the Holy Land . When the sea failed to part , many children , without guidance or provisions , were subsequently sold into slavery by Roman traders . Gods of the First and Twenty-first Century , Volume 2 : Divine Inspirations , 8th ed . ( Zypheron Press Ltd . ) . <p> 2 " Round and round the pole we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harp and bended bow / a merry tune and we skip and sow . " Nursery rhyme from Father Sildas Pious , Mythica Improbiba ( translated version ) , c. thirteenth century . <p> The air was a blur around her and the alley melted away as watercolors in a rainstorm . <p> She distantly felt her hand slip off Eliot 's shoulder . <p> The only things that remained in focus were the violin strings , but even those were a smear  --  plucked so fast they were a haze of vibrations . <p> She took a deep breath , half inhalation , half sigh ... and caught the scent of sardines , perspiration , and sulfurous burnt matches . Unclean was the word that rose to the forefront of her fading conscious mind . <p> And as she watched the vibrations fill her vision , another word came to her : chaos . <p> Even more than the thought of the unwashed old man , the thought of chaos , never-ending turmoil , strife , out of control and wild , washing her away ... for a reason she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She glared at the strings , focused on just one , as if she stared hard enough  --  like Grandmother  --  she could stop this out-of-control feeling . <p> With a twang , the string snapped . <p> The old man 's hand flew from his violin , and he sucked the index finger . <p> After a second , he withdrew the finger and she saw blood welling where the string had cut . <p> The old man looked at Eliot , then Fiona , still smiling , and said , " Well , I 'll be damned . " <p> His voice was a rich and resonant alto . It was n't what Fiona expected from someone who looked so shabby . <p> " That was great , " Eliot breathed . <p> The man nodded at Eliot and took a little bow . He reached into the folds of his ragged coat and withdrew a wax-paper envelope . Inside were coiled strings . He gestured to the package like a stage magician , then smoothed one hand over the wood of his battered violin . <p> Fiona tapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the old man she said , " We have to get work . . . thanks . " Her icy tone , however , effectively communicated that " thanks " was the last thing she meant . <p> The bum 's smile faded a bit . He bowed again to them and started unwinding the broken string from the pegbox . <p> " Come on . " Fiona pulled on Eliot . <p> Her brother whirled around and his eyes narrowed . <p> " If we 're late two days in a row , " she said , " Mike 's really going to lose it . " <p> Eliot 's expression of annoyance melted into one of concern . " Yeah . " He glanced back at the old man and waved . The man 's full smile returned . <p> " Was n't that the coolest thing ? " Eliot whispered to her . <p> " No , " she flatly replied . " It was kind of creepy . " <p> Fiona did , however , begin to understand Eliot 's fascination with music . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad if Grandmother let Eliot have a stupid radio ? Or was she right ? Would it have been too much of a distraction ? <p> They hurried around the corner and found every parking spot near the intersection of Midway and Vine occupied with gleaming SUVs and Mer-cedes convertibles . <p> Tourists . Ringo 's was going to be packed . <p> They crossed the street and ran up the stairs to the Pizza Palace . <p> Eliot held the door open and a blast of air-conditioning hit her . She shivered . <p> Mike was at the cashier 's counter . He had just handed off a party of four to Linda to seat . He took one look at Eliot and Fiona and the color drained from his face . <p> " You 've got to be kidding , " he said . " Today 's the start of the pinot noir festival in Napa  --  the place is jam-packed , and you two decide it 's time to raid the Goodwill Dumpster for their costume rejects ? " <p> Fiona flushed so hard that even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to defend them . " Hey , do n't  --  " <p> " The squirt , " Mike said , cutting Eliot off , " can dress like whatever freak he wants to . But you . " He looked Fiona over , disbelieving . " Wear that and everyone 's going to lose their appetite . " <p> This confirmed everything she had feared : her birthday dress really did look like a bad Halloween costume , all wrapped in a bow to put the finishing touch on her gift of humiliation . <p> She hated being in this family  --  with their rules , handmade clothes , never going anywhere . Tears blurred Fiona 's vision and made the pink satin of her dress look like cotton candy . <p> " Wear this . " Mike reached under the counter , grabbed a Ringo 's T-shirt , and threw it to her . It hit her chest and fell to the floor . <p> She knelt , blinking as fast as she could to get rid of her tears , and picked up the shirt . An iron-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it out of your paycheck , " Mike told her . <p> Eliot 's hands clenched . <p> " Okay , " Fiona whispered . " No problem . " <p> " And get one of the big heavy aprons from Johnny , " Mike said , " to cover up the rest . " <p> She nodded and her gaze dropped to the slate floor , no longer able to look Mike in the face . Her eyes and cheeks burned . <p> But she could n't move . She did n't want the dress to rustle satin over satin and draw even more attention to it . And even if she could muffle the fabric , how was she going to cross the dining room to the kitchen with all those people watching her ? <p> She froze there . Mortifled . <p> Mike moved around the counter and grabbed her by the arm  --  his thumb digging into the crook of her elbow . Electric pain lanced down her forearm . <p> " Come on , " he growled . " Get  --  " <p> She wrenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she ignored the pain , her head snapped up , and she stared him directly in the face . <p> " Do n't ! " she hissed through gritted teeth . <p> Her humiliation had been a wounded animal , curled into a fetal ball . . . but it had been provoked one too many times  --  and it uncoiled , rose up , and bared its fangs . <p> She sensed Eliot close at her side . . . ready to try to punch Mike in the nose . It was good to know he was there for her when it counted . <p> Fiona let her tears fall without blinking and continued to stare Mike down . <p> " Do n't , " she whispered . It was n't a whisper of shame , but one of barely contained rage . " Do n't ever touch me again . " <p> Mike 's mouth opened , as if he were going to say something , but no words came out . He slowly nodded , held up both hands in a " calm down " gesture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he breathed . " Just get that apron and get to work . " <p> But he did n't look away ... somehow still caught in Fiona 's glare . He twitched and his lips curled into a grimace , as if it hurt to remain there under her withering gaze . <p> The bell over the door jangled , and a couple entered . <p> She blinked . The spell broke . <p> Mike turned to the customers and his smile snapped into place . " Table for two ? " <p> Fiona took a deep breath . She turned , then she and Eliot marched through the dining room to the kitchen . <p> If anyone stared at her dress , snickered , or pointed , she did n't see . Her eyes were firmly fixed upon the floor again . <p> She pushed through the swinging doors and examined her throbbing arm . Where Mike had grabbed her , fingertip bruises dotted her skin . <p> " You okay ? " Eliot gently asked . <p> " Yeah . Sure . " For the first time in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . No . . . not just " felt like . " She would really have done it . <p> For a split second Fiona had focused her hate to a white-hot intensity . For a moment , she had wished that Mike Poole would never touch her , or anyone else , ever again . She had wanted him dead . <p> 8 <p> MIKE 'S HAND <p> Eliot stood before the vast double-basin sink , one side drained , one side filled with murky water , suds floating on top like clouds . This job sucked . But Eliot was no quitter . He finished whatever he started , even if there was no way of winning . Working at Ringo 's , though , was n't just another game  --  like a vocabulary insult or a race down the stairs . Nothing was worth Mike 's abuse every day . He did n't mind the bullying so much ; he could take it , but what Mike did to his sister . . . Eliot imagined plunging his boss 's head into the sink and giving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhaled , startled that his fantasy had turned so dark  --  more startled that it gave him a real sense of satisfaction . Eliot sighed . At least the lunch shift was almost over . He gazed at the water and his fingers unconsciously tapped the basin . That nursery-rhyme tune was still in his head . It played over and over and he imagined shapes in the suds . A violin coalesced , then a smile , a flock of white crows , and a hand . That hand reached out , and spinning slowly in the water , the fingers grasped and closed about an unseen object ... then the fingers writhed in pain . Johnny called from across the kitchen , " Hey , you okay , amigo ? " Eliot shook his head to clear the music . " Zoning out . Long shift . " Johnny dumped a bag of frozen wedge-cut potatoes into the deep fryer . Boiling grease hissed and popped . He stepped back and lowered the splash guard , but not before drops spattered the concrete floor . Johnny frowned at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bucket and mop to immediately clean it up . <p> Fiona pushed through the kitchen door . She looked on the verge of tears . <p> Sweat soaked through the layers of cotton T-shirt , apron , and pink dress . Marinara sauce spattered her from chin to knees . <p> " Double table of Lord of the Flies kids , " she said , and took a deep breath . " I 'm ready for a break . " <p> " I was just about to step out back , " Eliot told her . " Get some fresh air . " <p> She nodded , and they moved to the back door . <p> He 'd broach the subject of Mike outside . They 'd come up with some plan to get him off their backs . <p> Mike slammed into the kitchen . " Fiona wait , " he called after her . <p> She stopped and turned , her hands clasping each other so tight they were white . <p> Mike with his wavy , combed-back hair and his strong chin looked clean , fresh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wanted to talk to you , " Mike said . He glanced at Johnny and Eliot . " You guys give us a second ? " <p> Johnny rubbed his face . Eliot could tell he did n't want to leave Fiona alone with Mike . But Mike was the boss , and Johnny had a family to support with this job . He pulled the basket out of the deep fryer so the potatoes did n't burn . A few more drops of grease spattered onto the floor . " I 'll take a smoke out back . " <p> Eliot crossed his arms over his chest . There was no way he was leaving Fiona alone . <p> Mike glared at Eliot for a full five seconds . <p> " Okay , " Mike said with a sigh , " you might as well hear this , too , squirt . " <p> Fiona stood as tall as she could and stepped closer to Eliot , but her eyes could n't quite rise off the floor . " What do you want ? " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patented " calm down " gesture . " I wanted to say I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to grab you like that . " <p> But Mike 's right hand involuntarily flexed , and Eliot wondered if he was remembering how he took his sister 's arm . From the glint in his eyes , it looked as if he had enjoyed it . <p> Eliot wanted this creep gone from their lives . Forever . <p> The little singsong nursery rhyme pranced through his mind . <p> " Let me take a look at your elbow . " Mike came closer . He had on his most charming smile . " Is it bruised ? " <p> Fiona curled her arm protectively to her body . " Stay away from me . " <p> Mike halted and the warmth dissolved from his features . " If you two are thinking about telling Ringo anything  --  I was going to try and talk some reason here , but I think you do n't want to be reasonable . " His lips pursed . " You know what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go . " <p> " You . . . you 're firing us ? ! " Fiona gasped . " For what ? " <p> Eliot knew for what . So they would n't tell Ringo that his manager had assaulted one of his employees . Mike would fire them , and if they said anything , it would seem as if they were trying to get even . At least that 's what Mike could say and get away with . <p> People like him always got away with it . <p> Mike 's lips curled into a cruel smile . He was enjoying this . <p> " Why ? " Mike said to Fiona . " Because you 're both geeks . Because no one here wants to work with you . And because I say you 're fired . " <p> At that moment , Eliot had never hated anyone so much in his entire life . He wished Mike were dead . <p> Mike moved closer , maybe to better intimidate them , and stepped into a grease spot on the concrete floor . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm shot out to stop his fall  --  <p>  --  and it plunged into the boiling oil . <p> Mike screamed . <p> He rolled away . Fuming oil coated his arm up to the elbow , and the skin cooked and blistered . <p> He writhed on the floor , pulled his arm to him , then flung it away as the heat burned his chest . <p> Eliot and Fiona watched , horrified and dumbfounded for a heartbeat , then darted to his side . <p> The panic that had locked Eliot 's brain vanished . He knew what to do . They 'd both read and reread Marcellus Masters 's Practical First Aid and Surgical Guide .8 <p> 8 . Commissioned by NapolTon Bonaparte for his field surgeons . Bonaparte subsequently ordered all copies burned , proclaiming if such knowledge fell into the hands of his enemies , they would " gain miraculous powers to rejuvenate their front lines . " Masters was made inspector general and was allegedly responsible for saving thousands of French soldiers . Four copies of the manual are known to exist and reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that in modern first-aid guides . Victor Golden , Golden 's Guide to Extraordinary Books . ( Oxford : 1958 ) . <p> " Water , " Fiona said . <p> " The sink , " Eliot replied . " Careful . Do n't touch his arm . " <p> They lifted Mike by the armpits . He moaned and shivered . They dragged him to the sink and leaned him over the edge , his burned arm dangling into the basin . <p> Johnny ducked inside from the alley , cigarette dangling from his open mouth . When he saw Mike , he crossed himself . <p> " Call 911 , " Eliot shouted at him . " Now ! " <p> Johnny sprinted to the phone on the wall . <p> Eliot swiveled the faucet over Mike 's shoulder and turned on the cold water . <p> Mike screamed anew as water flowed down and over his burns . He tried to pull it out of the stream . <p> " No , " Fiona whispered . " Keep it there or you could lose the arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him . " The grease is in your sleeve . We 've got to cool it down . " <p> Mike kept crying , whimpering , but he ceased trying to yank his arm away . He hung limp , sobbing , between them . <p> Eliot looked at his sister , and she looked at him . He knew that Fiona was thinking the same thing he was : that Mike had burned his right hand  --  the one that had grabbed her . <p> 9 <p> VACATION INTERRUPTED <p> Sealiah lounged under a palm canopy on her private beach on the island of Bora-Bora , her home away from home.9 The locals feared this place , claiming it was full of " bad magic , " for when maritime disasters struck , the currents inevitably washed the bloated bodies onto this shore . Of course , she did nothing to dissuade these rumors ; privacy was a thing to be treasured and , when lost , mourned . The gold sun reflected off talc-white sand . Even filtered by the canopy and mosquito netting , it toasted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a rope of wet coppery hair twined around her neck and throat in a serpentine embrace . She was full of form but slender enough to have been a model , which she might have considered as it would have served her unquenchable vanity . . . but men and women already fell at her feet . She sponged off her brow , which was still wet from this afternoon 's skinny-dip . She had played with the docile gray reef sharks and whipped them into a feeding frenzy until the waters were red and clouded with bits of the once-living . She licked her lips , tasted blood , and this blossomed into a rare smile . It had been a delightful afternoon . . . . . . about to be interrupted . <p> 9 . Although the proper pronunciation of this entity 's name ( title ? ) has mutated through all of history , most scholars cite the common ancient use of " say-lay " as the most accurate . Gods of the First and Twenty-first Century , Volume 13 : Infernal Forces , 8th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An intruder was on her beach . <p> Her eyes opened to slits , and in her peripheral vision she saw a shadow on the path where sand met jungle . Whoever cast this shadow obviously wanted her to see it as it swayed back and forth . <p> Sealiah toyed with the emerald that nestled in her navel and pretended to ignore the dark visitor . Perhaps it was a curious tourist who would grow bored and leave . <p> But it stayed there , wavering ... waiting . <p> " Come , " she said with an expelled sigh . <p> Why were these moments  --  just as she was about to fully and completely relax  --  always , without fail , with **27;648;TOOLONG precision , interrupted ? <p> She sat up and was , save for the emerald in her navel and the knife strapped to her calf , still nude from her earlier swim . <p> Her last lover had bragged to his friends , describing her as " raw with feral beauty . " She had appreciated his compliment , but not so much appreciated his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how feral she could be . <p> The shadow skulked from the jungle , resolving into a Samoan man in a black silk windbreaker , shorts , and baseball cap . He fell at her feet , worshipful , his face nestled an inch from her toes , which , had she allowed , he would have kissed . <p> " Enough . " She waved her hand . " Up , up . Say what you came to tell me and then depart . " <p> The man stood , towering two heads over her . He was Urakabarameel , sometimes Mr. Uri Crumble , or just Uri when she was in a familial mood , her second-in-command of special operations . <p> He backed away a respectful two paces , and with eyes cast to the ground he reached into his jacket and withdrew a tiny black book that bulged to the bursting point with extra pages and a rainbow assortment of sticky notes . He opened it , seemingly at random , and read . <p> " M'lady Sealiah , " he said in a rumbling baritone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening . Our associates in Oxford are nervous . They demand you shore up the investment . " <p> " Really ? Well , ' demands ' in the middle of my vacation are not granted . " She crinkled her nose . " Sell my shares . I 'll take profit today . " <p> " That will cause a run on the three banks in  --  " " I said sell . " <p> Uri bowed . " As you command . " <p> " Let Britannia burn and sink into the sea for all I care . Next ? " <p> " A minor thing : the ambassador from Manila has sent you a gift of three Andalusian mares . I did not know what you wanted done with the animals . He also wishes to schedule lunch at your earliest convenience . " <p> " Oh , how wonderful , " she cried with joy . " Andalusians are not animals , Uri . They are treasures to be loved . " She tapped her lip with a curved , red fingernail and thoughtfully hummed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will teach these magnificent ladies to gallop in the surf of the South China Sea . Tell the ambassador , Saturday , New York . At Mitsukoshi 's . " <p> " Very good . " Uri bowed again and started to back away . <p> " Was there anything else ? " <p> " Nothing . Only a trivial matter that her ladyship need not bother with . " He closed his book and tucked it into his jacket . <p> She grabbed his wrist , digging in her nails . He flinched . <p> " Show me . " <p> Uri handed her his black book , and she flipped it open with her left hand . She continued to hold him with her right . <p> " It says , ' Post children . ' Do we know them ? " <p> " A low-level surveillance operation . A dead end . Two little nobodies . " <p> " Oh ? " She released her grasp and ran her index fingernail up his arm , tracing a bulging vein  --  then dug it into the crook of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood vessel . <p> " Then why , " she purred , " is it in your oh-so-important black-operations book ? " <p> He fell to one knee and the impact sent a tremor through the sand . To his credit , however , he did not cry out in pain . <p> So Sealiah twisted her grasp  --  squishing vein and nerve bundle . <p> " A far-fetched clue , " he grunted . " We thought it might lead to our long-missing cousin . " <p> She released Uri . " Ah , yes , I recall . Something about a trust fund ? " <p> " Yes , m'lady . " Uri held the inside of his arm ; a trickle of blood oozed and dripped upon the sand . <p> He stared at her navel and the emerald there ; the glint of it reflected in his eyes . He coveted her power , of course ; it was the way of her kind to take whatever they had the strength to hold . But couple such a gaze with the obfuscation of these Post children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound with anticipation . <p> Uri looked away , his face burning . <p> Or perhaps , to her great disappointment , there was no conspiracy . Nothing on Uri 's part but a moment of wishful thinking . What a pity that he would ever only be her faithful lapdog . <p> " What about them ? " she asked . <p> " We intercepted a money transfer from what we thought an old double-blind account of Louis 's . We were able to trace the originator of the transfer : a lawyer 's office in central California . I retrieved the pertinent files personally . Trust fund for two children . It is unrelated to our case . " <p> Uri reached deep into his windbreaker and drew out a slim laptop computer . He opened it , turned it on , and presented it to Sealiah . <p> She sat , waiting for the file to open . <p> Uri rifled again through his jacket , deeper , losing his entire right arm into its folds , and removed a card table , which he set up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . On-screen , two high-resolution scans appeared . A boy . A girl . <p> They had smiles as if someone had a knife at their backs and had forced them to grin . Siblings obviously . Possibly twins . <p> Uri fumbled about within his windbreaker , and there was the clink of ice in crystal and the slosh of liquor . He set a Bloody Mary on the table . <p> Sealiah took it and sucked the salt off the rim . <p> " There was only one minor complication , " Uri admitted . " A Driver appeared at the same office . I made sure these files were destroyed before he got there . . . but still , the coincidence is interesting . " <p> " Driver , " Sealiah whispered . " What would a Driver be doing fumbling about on this matter ? " <p> " He could not . If I understand the pact correctly , they are not allowed to interfere with our affairs . As we can not theirs . As I said , a mere coincidence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again at the children . There was something familiar . <p> Sealiah increased magnification on the boy 's eyes . Mixed in with the swirls of gray , blue , and green , a hint of nobility was reflected in the windows of his soul . <p> She returned to normal magnification and squinted so her acute vision blurred . <p> Yes , the boy 's eyes , the slender but strong bridge of the girl 's nose , the high cheekbones and arching brows on both . How could she have missed it ? Whoever had camouflaged them had done a masterful job : they had transformed divine into dull . <p> She looked up and pinned Uri with a hard stare . " And is there any update on the whereabouts of Louis Piper ? " <p> " Nothing after the last sighting in Albuquerque . He was living in a cardboard box . " <p> " Yes . . . " She traced her fingernail over the girl 's strong chin . There was something else about these children . Something not connected to Louis , but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little nobodies . These two were definitely involved , and possibly of great value . <p> " Is he connected to this ? " Uri moved to get a better look at the computer screen . <p> It was an outside , remote , astronomically distant possibility . But when any such possibility was the only one that accounted for the known circumstances  --  a boy and a girl that bore no small resemblance to the man who had been her most powerful adversary , and a Driver who worked for those wielding power equal to her own  --  such things could simply not be ignored . <p> Nor could such a possibility be confronted alone . <p> " Summon the Board of Directors . " <p> " I 'm sorry , m'lady , " Uri said , coughing a slight chuckle . " For a moment I thought you said ' summon the Board . ' " <p> She narrowed her green eyes to slits and looked deep into his so there could be no miscommunication . " That is precisely what I ordered . " <p> Uri backed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as ever , but I remind you that the Board will demand tribute if so summoned by a non-Director . " <p> " Yes , and you will see to that personally . " <p> Uri bowed so she could not see his face , but Sealiah nonetheless sensed his apprehension . <p> " It shall be as you say . And the children ? " <p> " Find them , " she said . " Shadow them . Report to me the moment you see or hear anything . " <p> Uri was as loyal as any of their kind could ever be . As tribute to the Board , he would be her eyes and ears to its inner workings . . . losing him , however , would be like cutting off a limb . <p> She had to send him , though . Whom else could she count on to double-deal and backstab on her behalf ? <p> Meanwhile she had to prepare for the gathering of the Board . There were weapons to sharpen and armor to mend . <p> She looked back at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one did not face one 's brothers and sisters without taking careful precautions against carnage and bloodshed . <p> Copyright 2009 by Eric Nylund .
