<p> Seven years ago , some pundits were readying Johnny Isakson 's political obituary . They should 've waited . <p> Isakson 's disappointing loss to Guy Millner in the 1996 GOP primary for the U.S. Senate race only set the stage for one of Georgia 's most impressive political comebacks . <p> Three years later , Isakson won Newt Gingrich 's old U.S. House seat . Today , the three-term congressman finds himself leading the pack in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Zell Miller ( D-Ga. )  --  so far . <p> A 30-year veteran of state politics , Isakson has raised six times as much money as his nearest Republican opponent . He has a solid political base in the Republican-rich north Atlanta suburbs . And he has even scored points with the most conservative wing of the GOP , which he had alienated during the 1996 campaign with his moderate statements on abortion . <p> " Johnny has proven wrong any naysayers who have questioned his conservative record , " said state Rep. Jerry Keen ( R-St . Simons Island ) , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Keen supported Millner in 1996 because he backed a constitutional ban on abortion and Isakson did not . This time around , Keen has endorsed Isakson . " I 'm supporting Isakson because I think he has the best chance to win , " Keen said . <p> Despite his advantages , Isakson plans to run harder than in any of his previous campaigns . After all , he has lost the only two statewide races he ever entered . <p> " This is my 16th campaign , " Isakson , 58 , said during an interview last week in his Washington office . " And if there 's one thing I 've learned , it 's this : Every minute you sit contemplating that you are where you need to be is a minute the other side is going to take advantage of you . So we 're working hungry , and we 're working hard . " <p> Pioneer of Georgia GOP <p> Isakson is a pioneer of Georgia Republican politics , but has never reached its highest peaks . He has a record that is solidly conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not conservative enough . He weathered several high-profile defeats as his party slowly gathered strength . <p> There 's nothing like a few decades ' worth of battle scars , he said , to prepare a politician for a high-profile campaign like the one on which he has embarked . <p> " If you ca n't learn from your mistakes and losses , I do n't know that you 're that qualified to serve , " he said . " That 's what life is about , learning from adversity , learning from difficulty . And I certainly have . " <p> The Georgia race has become a focus of the national Republican Party , which believes it can pick up three Senate seats in the once solidly Democratic South . Republicans in the Senate now hold 51 seats to the Democrats ' 48 ( there is one independent ) . <p> Three contenders have lined up for the party 's nomination in the July 22 Republican primary . Topping the list is six-term U.S. Rep. Mac Collins of Butts County , who is backed by political strategist Tom Perdue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' upset victory in the 2002 U.S. Senate race . Former Godfather 's Pizza CEO Herman Cain has also joined the fray , along with Atlanta businessman Al Bartell . <p> Ethics watchdog George Anderson says he will seek the Libertarian Party 's nomination . So far the only Democrat to mount a campaign is little-known state Sen. Mary Squires of Norcross , whose last campaign report indicated she had raised barely $5,000 . Isakson has raised nearly $4 million , compared with Collins ' $678,000 and Cain 's $316,000 . <p> " Isakson is clearly the front-runner at this point , " said Emory University political scientist Merle Black . " He has a huge advantage at this early stage of the game . " <p> Isakson , who attained one of the House 's leadership positions when he was named deputy whip last year , was presiding over a debate in January when an aide handed him a news release . It was Miller 's surprise announcement that he would retire . <p> " He did n't give me any forewarning , " said Isakson , a longtime friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid . " I was in the chair so . . . nobody could call me , nobody could talk to me . I presided for three hours . . . contemplating what I would do . " <p> Within a week , Isakson called a news conference in the state Capitol where his political career began to announce he would run for Miller 's seat . Backers waved campaign signs from his 1996 U.S. Senate bid . <p> Isakson now gives five to 10 speeches a week and has appeared at more than 130 events since he kicked off his campaign . He credits his parents for his belief in hard work , whether in his business life or on the campaign trail . <p> Roots in south Fulton <p> Isakson was born three days after Christmas 1944 , as World War II was nearing an end , the second child of Ed and Julia Isakson of south Fulton County . His father drove a Greyhound bus while his mother cared for their growing family and helped his dad renovate a series of old houses . <p> " My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , " Isakson said . " My father and my mother would buy an old house nobody else would buy because of the condition . My mother would sew curtains , and they 'd paint it and fix it up and they 'd sell it . " <p> Isakson attended metro Atlanta public schools and , early in his teens , began earning a paycheck . In the summer of 1959 , he worked for a surveying crew cutting brush along what would become the northern section of I-285 . <p> At the University of Georgia , Isakson first flirted with politics . The business major volunteered for Republican Barry Goldwater 's 1964 presidential campaign . <p> Isakson became seriously interested in politics in 1972 , when Republican President Richard Nixon faced a challenge from Sen. George McGovern ( D-S.D . ) . By this time , Isakson had married , was working for Northside Realty in Cobb County  --  he would eventually run the company  --  and was raising two children . <p> " I was working hard trying to figure out how I was going to educate those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at McGovern and Nixon and the philosophies of the parties and I said , ' I 'm a Republican . ' " <p> In 1974 , he ran for the state Legislature and lost . He dusted himself off and two years later won a House seat at a time when Georgia was a lonely place for Republicans . By 1983 , he was GOP leader in the House ; Republicans held only 19 of the 180 seats . <p> In 1986 , Isakson became the first Republican ever to run against Democrat Tom Murphy for the House speaker 's job . Murphy stayed in the job three decades and made a career out of crushing his political enemies . <p> For his own comfort , " that did not make any sense at all , " Isakson said . " But it made a lot of sense in that it sent a message that Republicans are here to challenge the status quo . " <p> Isakson again challenged Democratic domination when he ran as the Republican nominee for governor in 1990 against Miller . Miller won , but later appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By 1996 , Isakson was ready for a run at the most powerful legislative chamber in the world , the U.S. Senate . But he was outflanked by Guy Millner , a businessman who won the GOP nomination in a runoff after a bruising campaign . <p> In a televised ad , Isakson said he would never back a constitutional ban on abortion and " make criminals out of women and their doctors . " Millner blasted Isakson as an abortion rights supporter , which alienated many social conservatives . Millner won the nomination , but lost to Democrat Max Cleland . <p> Record under debate <p> The abortion issue has continued to dog Isakson , who maintains that his record speaks for itself . <p> " Every time it comes up , we will deal with the record , " he said . " I 'm not going to address innuendo . " <p> Isakson said in an interview that he personally opposes abortion , but he supports a woman 's right to the procedure in cases of rape , incest or when her life is at stake . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to require parental consent when minors seek an abortion . <p> The National Right to Life organization gives Isakson an 81 percent rating . It gives Collins a 100 percent rating . <p> Sadie Fields , chair of the Georgia Christian Coalition , said that since 1996 Isakson had reached out to the anti-abortion wing of the Republican Party . Fields ' organization does not endorse candidates , but prints a voter guide that contrasts candidates ' records . <p> " On the issues that have come up this year in Congress that are pro-life , he Isakson has voted with us , " Fields said . <p> Isakson points with pride to a signed " thank you " from President Bush for his support of the No Child Left Behind program , the president 's major education reform . He also likes to point out he has a 100 percent rating from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , an " A " rating from the National Rifle Association and a 96 percent rating from the American Conservative Union . <p> If his opponents try to challenge his conservative credentials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't run against people , I run for something . I 'm not afraid of a challenge or a fight . I have no fear .
