Unlike its much-buzzed-about HBO brethren , the cop drama The Wire was not dubbed an instant cultural phenomenon when it debuted last summer . Not as operatic as The Sopranos , as sleek as Six Feet Under or as trendy as Sex and the City , it was not the kind of show that becomes an automatic pop-cult reference for op-ed columnists or lands articles about its stars ' footwear in IN STYLE . Like its underfunded , workaday cops , it just plugged away until it outshone anything else on TV . <P> The Wire is that rare specimen , a work about social issues that is not boring . Last season detailed a single investigation of a drug gang , which  --  just as rare for TV  --  got as much screen time and character depth as the cops . And as the police tangled with bureaucratic politics and the gang unfolded its secrets like a black Sopranos family , it became a story about the collapse of faith in institutions and the death of inner cities . <P> In its second season , The Wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action to Baltimore 's port , where Detective James McNulty ( Dominic West ) has been exiled to the harbor patrol for ticking off his bosses . The waterfront is an ideal setting for The Wire 's murky morality  --  a place that is neither here nor there , the porous membrane between America and the Other , the teeming intake for legal and illegal markets . Its shipping containers , stacked for acres like so many Pez , feed a ravenous economy with cameras and vodka and hookers  --  this season 's case starts when a group of young women shipped from Eastern Europe turns up dead in one of the metal " cans . " <P> In TV-speak , shows like CSI are called procedurals because they focus on the technique of police work . But The Wire shows what a misnomer that term is for a sprint in which DNA analysis puts a baddie behind bars in an hour . Here the cops use index cards and manual typewriters instead of electron microscopes and bite into paper trails like a dog attacking a steak . This attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a dense boulder of a story that moves creakily for the first couple of hours . But once it gets rolling , it 's irresistible because of the humanity creator-writer David Simon finds in his characters , from cops who risk their careers if they seek out tough cases ( because those cases raise the unsolved-murder rate ) to down-and-out union workers taking payoffs to let contraband ( or worse ) slip by customs . <P> More than a crime writer or social dramatist , Simon is a poet of beautiful losers . He has an unfailing ear for dialogue ( getting a hard-to-solve case is " catching a stone whodunit " ) , and he 's abetted by the subtle performances of regulars like Sonja Sohn and Wendell Pierce . Even crooked union boss Frank Sobotka ( Chris Bauer ) is more pitiable than loathsome  --  he 's a dinosaur and knows it  --  and his underlings are the blue-collar counterpart to last season 's no-hope drug soldiers , who are on the scene this year too . If The Wire depicts a war on crime , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trenches , with little hope of victory or reward . The cops soldier on anyway , driven less by idealism than stubbornness . They deserve recognition . And so does TV 's hardest-working drama .  --  By James Poniewozik
