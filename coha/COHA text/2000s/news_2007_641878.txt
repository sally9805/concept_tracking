<p> So there were the Bears , dumbed-down and demoralized , doing playoff math equations that left their likely tragic number at two . There were the fans , disgusted and sizing up Cedric Benson for full-frontal abuse , hoping the next running back will be Michael ( The Burner ) Turner and debating whether the next quarterback should be Donovan McNabb , Derek Anderson or Sid Luckman 's ghost . <p> Hopeless and dark was Halas Hall , ready to confirm the death of the sixth Super Bowl runner-up in seven years to fumble the postseason the following year . Lovie Smith was dealing was a report from Pro Football Weekly  --  I think my grandfather subscribed  --  that players are taking advantage of him by blowing off practices . Even Brian Urlacher , who deems the Chicago media too negative in his misplaced ramblings , was n't optimistic when he reported to work this week . " At times , we 've played like crap , " he said . <p> But then , from some outerworldly place lacking common sense , a flash of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a young man named Lane Kiffin who either was the fourth or fifth choice last offseason of mothballs-stuffed Al Davis , was asked whether he 'd kick the football Sunday to Devin Hester . It 's the sort of thing asked merely as a formality these days , with reporters expecting " no friggin ' way " or " next question " from any sane strategist who has watched The Hesterizer become the greatest returner in NFL history . Kiffin , astonishingly , had a different answer . <p> " Yes , " he said . <p> Everyone waited for a punch line . There was none . Kiffin , whom we 'll now call Express Lane , was telling the world he 'll willingly play Russian Roulette with the most explosive weapon in sports . He does n't appear to be kiffin ' around , either . " We 're excited about the challenge , " he said . " It 's no fun to kick it out of bounds , so we 're going to see how well we can cover . " <p> I realize Raiders culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game day in the Coliseum is a hybrid of Halloween , Monty Python 's Flying Circus and an Amy Winehouse duet with Pete Doherty . But Kiffin seems to have lost his mind with all the other loons in the infamous Black Hole . He wants to test Hester  --  on punts , kickoffs , the whole 109 yards  --  as if it 's a required act of manhood . I 'd say Express Lane has two days to either get a lobotomy or find a new job . Because this is the kind of decision that causes a coach to be fired on the spot , especially when he works for Davis . Wearing Members Only jackets 20 years later , Darth Raider definitely is out on the fringe but remains coherent enough to know you do n't challenge Hester . <p> Urlacher : ' I ca n't wait to watch ' <p> " It 's going to be a tremendous test for us this week , with maybe the best returner ever to play the game , " Kiffin said . " So we 're going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been playing really well on special teams the last few weeks , and now here we go with our best test . " <p> Unless hundreds of those scary Black Hole inhabitants help the coverage team , Kiffin 's logic suggests the job is too big for him . The Bears are reeling after a 3-5 start , but the Hester reprieve brightened their preparation week and gave them a new angle beyond what 's wrong with Benson , why did Good Brian Griese turn to Bad Brian and why the once-mighty defense continues to be shredded . Urlacher , king of the one-syllable utterances in local media settings , was heard to wax jubilantly in his conference-call chat with northern California media . <p> " Serious ? Punts and kickoffs ? It will be fun then , " he said . " I ca n't wait to watch . The last few games he has n't gotten many opportunities but when he does , he definitely takes advantage of them . So , I 'm excited to hear that . " <p> At first , Smith was a bit skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We wo n't know for sure if he 's serious , of course , until kickoff . But Smith used to work in Tampa Bay for Kiffin 's father , well-regarded defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin . He has known Lane for years and says he 's " a man of his word . " It could be a bluff , sure . Or , it could be a rookie coach calling out his team to meet the challenge . <p> " We would definitely welcome that philosophy . Does he mean it ? Most teams have n't kicked to him , " Smith said . " I can understand why you 'll get a guy that would say , ' Hey , he puts on his shoes just like everyone else . We 're going to kick the ball to him . We need to change the tempo . ' If I was on the other side of the field , I would kick the ball to Devin Hester . " <p> No , he would n't . Hook Lovie to a polygraph machine , and hear it buzz . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably think Kiffin should return to drawing up plays for Pete Carroll at USC . For now , they are acting like obedient sheep and backing the strategy . " I 'm glad because I would have been mad at him if he 'd have said , ' Hey , I do n't think you guys can do it . I 'm not kicking it to him , " ' said Jarrod Cooper , part of the 27th-ranked kickoff defense team . " We respect Hester just like everyone else does , but you do n't turn your whole game plan upside down . You do n't play scared . " <p> Strategy worked for Lions <p> Personally , I 'd rather play Hester scared and smart than brave and dumb . In the coming hours , I fully expect Davis to come out of his closet , saddle up to Kiffin and ask if he likes his coaching salary . Someone then will hand Kiffin a tape of the Bears-Lions game , which shows a successful variety of squibs and out-of-bounds kicks in Detroit 's season-defining victory  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kick the ball into Lake Michigan and make sure it sinks to the bottom , " Marinelli had vowed before the game , an edict the Lions violated only once . Maybe someone will compile clips of Hester 's touchdowns and thrillmaking and remind Kiffin that No. 23 has 10 career returns for scores in only 27 games . Or maybe Kiffin 's father will call frantically and whip some sense into his kid . <p> If not , Christmas is coming early for Hester . All week , the Bears have been telling horror stories about the Coliseum . Desmond Clark recalled his Denver days , saying of the atmosphere , " It depends on what type of person you are . For me , it 's fun . Some guys might see it a different way when people throw batteries , know about your history , and guys in the Black Hole are yelling all kind of things at you . " It 's a spooky and sinister place , no doubt .
