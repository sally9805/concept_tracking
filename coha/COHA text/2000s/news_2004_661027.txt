<p> A year ago , he was the man who could be president of the new Iraq . For decades , Ahmed Chalabi had crafted and pursued a vision - an exile 's dream - of ousting Saddam Hussein with Washington 's help . <p> Now , Mr. Chalabi has fallen far from the graces of his American backers . His home and office in Baghdad were raided by coalition forces , and he is excluded from Iraq 's transitional government . <p> But sources in Iraq and elsewhere are reluctant to write the political obituary of Chalabi just yet . An inveterate political survivor , he is on the move still , seeking to build ties to Iraq 's Shiite religious establishment and , according to some of his former allies in the US government , to Iran . <p> " The one thing you can say for sure about Chalabi is that you can never count him out , " says Ghassan Attiya , a former Iraqi exile and one-time supporter of the Iraqi National Congress , the political party Chalabi led . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The story of how Chalabi charmed his way to the top and became the Iraq guru to key advisers around President Bush goes a long way to explaining why the administration both overestimated Mr. Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction programs and underestimated the difficulties of occupation . <p> Indeed , a template for the experience that US officials now say they 've undergone with Chalabi can be found in the 500-year-old words of Machiavelli . " How dangerous a thing it is to believe " exiles , he wrote . " Such is their extreme desire to return home , that they naturally believe many things that are false . " <p> To be sure , Chalabi is n't a Svengali who single-handedly deceived the US into imagining postinvasion Iraq would be easy . Instead , a cadre of high-level Americans - Vice President Dick Cheney ; Richard Perle , former adviser to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ; and Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith - were inclined to believe what he had to say , despite the objections of many colleagues . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would quickly normalize relations with Israel and build an oil pipeline to the Israeli port of Haifa . A new Iraq would strike a major blow against terrorism and the postwar environment would be stable , with US forces embraced by grateful Iraqis . Chalabi assured his audience that his support crossed ethnic and sectarian lines . <p> Chalabi 's Iraqi National Congress provided invaluable intelligence to the US before and after the first Gulf War . More recently , the Pentagon says the INC 's information has helped save US soldiers ' lives . And Chalabi denies passing secrets to Iran . <p> Yet many critics felt his dream of a new Iraq was without any grounding in reality . " We 've known all along that anything coming from Chalabi should be treated with extreme skepticism , particularly this stuff about being showered with flowers , " says a senior State Department official . " But we were overruled by people at Defense who think we were just looking for excuses not to go to war .

They 'd been told to expect thousands of Iraqis to flock to the banner of the man the US expected to install as an interim prime minister . But instead , they found that no one had ever heard of him . In the months that followed , with the failure of US searchers to find significant chemical or biological weapons that Chalabi promised would be there , his star fell further . Though given a seat on the US-appointed Governing Council , he spent much of his time abroad . <p> All this led to the cancellation of his monthly $ 340,000 check from the Defense Department for intelligence assistance in April . On May 20 , US-backed forces raided his home and offices in Iraq as part of a corruption investigation . <p> Chalabi became the focus of intense American interest while getting his doctorate in math at the University of Chicago in the 1960s . There , he came to know Albert Wohlstetter , the mathematician and cold-war strategist who influenced a generation of conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perle and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , became Washington 's chief cheerleaders for invading Iraq . <p> After getting his degree , Chalabi moved to Beirut , Lebanon , where his brother Jawad was running the Middle East Banking Corp. , or Mebco . After a few years , Chalabi decided to help expand the family banking empire , moving to Jordan to found Petra Bank in 1978 . <p> In the 1980s , Petra flourished , introducing computer banking systems to Jordan . Chalabi also excelled at currying favor , growing particularly close to Jordan 's then Crown Prince Hasan bin Talal , the brother of Jordan 's deceased King Hussein . " In those days , Chalabi was almost like the uncrowned king of Jordan , " says Jamal Dmour , a military-court prosecutor who helped investigate Petra and is now a member of parliament . <p> His position was cemented , at least in part , by strategic lending to influential figures . In particular , Jordanian officials say Chalabi lent about $ 30 million to Prince Hasan , and his relationships with key officials enabled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Mr. Dmour . <p> But in late 1989 , with a banking crisis looming , Mohammed Said Nabulsi , the former Jordanian central bank governor who coordinated the bailout of Petra after its 1989 collapse , made a strong case to the late King Hussein to put the bank under government supervision . Chalabi fled two days after the order was given to allow government officials to review the bank 's records . What they found there stunned them . <p> " The scale of fraud at Petra Bank was enormous , " says Mr. Nabulsi , who is now an investment banker . " It was like a tiny Enron . " <p> After two years of investigations , Chalabi was convicted on embezzlement and fraud charges , and sentenced in 1992 by a military court to 22 years . <p> Last week in Baghdad a Chalabi spokesman , Mithal al-Alusi , gave reporters a document he claimed cleared Chalabi of all charges at Petra Bank . Mr. Alusi said the letter , not on official letterhead or bearing any sort of seal , nor carrying Chalabi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God this dirty plot has been disclosed which was intended to hurt relations between Jordan and Iraq , " Mr. Alusi said . <p> Aid begins to flow <p> The failure of Chalabi 's banking interests did n't hurt him for long . <p> Armed with Washington contacts provided by Perle and what some people call a preternatural charm , Chalabi convinced the US that he was the man to lead an exile opposition to Hussein after the 1991 Gulf War . <p> CIA aid flowed to the nascent Iraqi National Congress , to the tune of $ 100 million , which set up training camps and propaganda operations in Northern Iraq , which a US-imposed no-fly zone kept largely autonomous . <p> While the CIA relationship soured in 1995 , mostly because case officers felt he could n't deliver on his promises but also over concern about Chalabi 's contacts with Iran , he was by now a well-known figure to the US government . Congress guaranteed his INC money in 1998 and with the presidency of Mr. Bush , Chalabi 's most fervent supporters were back in government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently said that they believe Chalabi 's version of events , and some still do . <p> Perle , who 's out of government at the moment but was the principal broker between Chalabi and the US , says criticism of Chalabi is the product of an irrational dislike of him on the part of the State Department and the CIA . <p> Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute , a Washington think tank where Perle is a resident scholar and Mr. Cheney used to sit on the board , dismissed the corruption conviction against Chalabi in a written commentary earlier this month . <p> " Throughout the 1990s , Chalabi was regularly accused of malfeasance by his enemies , " she wrote . The conviction in Jordan " has never been documented . " <p> Still , the man whose British-installed Hashemite family , which was exiled in 1958 by a nationalist coup , may be using his falling out with the United States to gain credibility in Iraq as an independent . <p> " What the Americans have done earned me a medal from the Iraqi people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dubai . " It invalidated everything that had been said about me being with the Americans . " <p> People close to Chalabi say he 's trying to build a new power base , primarily among Shiite religious figures and politicians , as his key to survival in the emerging Iraqi political order . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
