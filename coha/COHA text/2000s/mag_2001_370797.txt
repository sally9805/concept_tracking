At the close of the Kyoto Global-Warming Treaty discussions held in Bonn last week , exhausted negotiators from nearly every country on earth had reason to be proud . They had done what no one expected  --  they reached a breakthrough agreement to limit greenhouse gases . During the concluding remarks , as each speaker praised the next , only the chief U.S. official on the scene drew an undiplomatic response . When Paula Dobriansky told the gathering that the Bush Administration " will not abdicate our responsibility " to address global warming , the hall filled with boos . That 's because the U.S. , the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , sat on the sidelines in Bonn . <P> George W. Bush has yet to decide what , if anything , he will do to combat global warming . But he believes the Kyoto treaty is fatally flawed because it does n't require developing countries to limit their fossil-fuel use immediately , as it does industrialized countries . So he kept the U.S. out of the discussions . In doing so , the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international response to the problem . And Bush may be in danger of losing control over climate action domestically . After months of internal debate , the Administration is still " consulting " on the issue . <P> That noise you hear is Congress rushing to fill the leadership vacuum . At least six climate plans have been proposed so far . The first is sponsored by former Republican , now Independent Senator Jim Jeffords , chairman of the Senate Environment Committee , who proposes to cut greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants . <P> Congressional action this week will center on reducing emissions by raising vehicle fuel-efficiency standards , including those for SUVs . If SUVs had to meet the same standards as cars  --  something Massachusetts Representative Ed Markey will propose this week  --  they could save consumers an estimated $7 billion at the pump this year and cut gasoline demand by tens of billions of gallons over 10 years . <P> The " drill Detroit , not the Arctic " campaign will find some support this week when the National Academy of Sciences releases a long-awaited study . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising fuel-efficiency standards , by making cars lighter , makes vehicles less safe , is still likely to conclude that fuel efficiency can be increased at least 25% with existing technology . <P> If a fuel-efficiency bill reaches his desk , Bush could be in a bind  --  caught between auto lobbyists ( his chief of staff used to be one ) and his concern for energy security . With new technology putting impressive fuel efficiency within reach , it will be hard for him to oppose measures that could reduce the national appetite for foreign oil by millions of barrels a year . <P>  --  By Dick Thompson/Washington
