Now that the shock has worn off  --  and we 've all had a chance to absorb the idea that our trusty old IRAS and 401(k) accounts might be gobbled up by President Bush 's radical savings proposals  --  it 's a good time to get prepared by playing " what if . " But first , a quick review : Bush wants to shelve dozens of types of tax-deferred accounts , from IRAS and 401(k)s to 529s ( for college ) , and replace them with three much simpler animals : <P>  --  ERSAs ( employer retirement savings accounts ) would be employer-sponsored workplace accounts . Employees could kick in as much as $12,000 a year in pretax money ( the best kind ) or $14,000 a year if they 're age 50 or older . Taxes would be due upon withdrawal , either after age 59 1/2  --  as with today 's 401(k)s  --  or perhaps earlier . <P>  --  RSAs ( retirement savings accounts ) would replace traditional IRAs . Contributions would not be tax deductible , but limits would be higher . A wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7,500 a year for herself and a nonworking spouse . Accounts would grow tax free , then withdrawals from age 58 would be tax free . <P>  --  LSAs ( lifetime savings accounts ) would be the most flexible , similar to Roth IRAs but with annual after-tax contributions of up to $7,500 per person a year . Contri-butions would n't need to be from earned income , and account holders could withdraw any amount , at any age and for any reason , free of tax and penalty . <P> Significantly , none of the Bush accounts include mandatory withdrawals or income limits . Democrats have spent most of the past few weeks complaining about that last point  --  Bush 's plan is mighty juicy for the affluent . A single person could sock away nearly $30,000 annually , and a couple twice as much . Add two kids with LSAs in their names and contributions from parents or grandparents , and you 're sheltering more than $70,000 a year from future taxes . <P> Another criticism has come roughly equally from the left and the right : many small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their own benefit and let employees participate only because the law says they must . Under the Bush plan , a small employer might not set up a workplace plan at all , because he could contribute so much to his own LSA and RSA . Workers could lose out . <P> As a longtime observer of Americans ' saving and investing habits , I hope that any inequities in the Bush proposal are treated by Congress as flaws to be fixed rather than as deal killers . Unlike any previous scheme , Bush 's plan has a shot at solving our country 's biggest long-term financial problem : about half of us simply do n't save . With streamlined tax-deferred options and no-questions-asked LSA withdrawals , Americans might feel they can save without locking up their money for decades . Fears that unrestricted LSAs would lead some undisciplined savers to ruin  --  they would bleed their accounts for frivolous reasons  --  may be well founded . But many , many more individuals , I believe , would be inspired to really save .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
