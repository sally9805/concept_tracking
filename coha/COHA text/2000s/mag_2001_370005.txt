For one night , I would reverse the flow of the universe . Give me your dorks , your losers , your thick-chained mooks from Jersey yearning to get lucky . For them I would open the golden door while the beautiful people waited outside . I could do this because Lotus , the hardest club to get into in Manhattan , let me work the velvet rope as doorman last Thursday , giving me complete control over who entered . I called all my friends , told them to dress badly and show up after midnight . To up the dork content even further I sent an e-mail to the entire TIME staff , many of whom promised to come . A large percentage of them were from IT . This was going to be good . <P> At 11 that night , I was given an earpiece , a sleeve microphone , a clipboard , two giant bodyguards and a stack of tickets : $20 , $10 and comp , which I could give out at will . I was assisted by doorman Brantly Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn away trashy ones . When I pressed him , he explained , " No fake breasts . " This whole beautiful-people thing , I was learning , is highly subjective . When I asked him if a group of women in line met his qualifications , he shook his head and said , " Look at shoes . You can always tell by the shoes . " I was starting to wonder about Brantly . <P> It was 11:08 when I got my first opportunity to strike a blow for the homely . A trio of beautiful women got to the rope ; I looked them up and down and said , " I 'm sorry , but there 's a private party here tonight . " When I asked for their names , they asked me my name and kissed me on both cheeks . That 's when I realized they were really , really beautiful . Plus , the kissing made them my 13th and 14th most significant sexual relationship in my life , so I really had to give them comp tickets . <P> Once I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't stop handing them tickets . My only defense is that other than my friends , the tech guys from TIME and a whole lot of people I 'd never met who said they were " friends of Joel Stein , " no dorks came . The only people who go to these kinds of clubs are awful people who act self-important and try too hard . And it so happens I prefer good-looking awful people to ugly awful people . <P> But even more ego gratifying than being kissed by models was rejecting people . One guy brought six models and promised to buy a bottle of champagne . I sent him back to his stretch limo . I shooed away a man who called himself Papa and tried to stuff a $50 in my palm . I sent home a Wall Street guy who kept offering to " take care of me " and making me look at his date . And I could n't say yes to the guy with a bandage on his nose who wanted a sympathy ticket for his " deviated septum " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paris , Greece , Miami and " all the way from the Upper West Side . " I was on so much of a power trip I sent away Puff Daddy 's bodyguards . That may have been a bad call . <P> At 3 a.m. , I handed in my clip-on microphone and earpiece and asked Brantly if he 'd let me in the club in the future . " Sure , " he said , telling me that he felt we 'd bonded after our night together . " But you would have to pay . "
