A Story of Hope To appreciate the city 's transformation , consider its past . In 1969 , Walter Cronkite declared Chattanooga the nation 's dirtiest city . Soot from the iron mills stained the air . The river was tainted ; its banks an industrial wasteland . " All we had was hot pavement with litter blowing across it , " remembers former mayor Bob Corker , a Chattanoogan who envisioned what his city could be . Now a U.S. Senator , Corker set in motion a plan for a cleaner , greener , friendlier Chattanooga .

" We 've connected our city so people can walk , " says Senator Corker , who helped raise $120 million to complete the city 's transformation in just 35 months . Walkable Downtown Making Chattanooga pedestrian friendly was the smartest move of all . Parking can be tough during big events , but you can push a stroller everywhere .
