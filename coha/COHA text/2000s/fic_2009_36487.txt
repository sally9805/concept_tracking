The good news about my cruise is , I did n't get seasick . The bad news is , I almost got hacked to death by a raving loony . But , hey . Life 's funny that way . My life , that is . Just when I think things are going smoothly someone comes along and tries to eviscerate me . <p> But let 's rewind to the day it all began , shall we ? <p> My neighbor Lance was stretched out on my bed , watching me as I raced around tossing clothes into a suitcase . <p> " I still ca n't believe you 're going on a cruise by yourself , " he said , shaking his blond curls in disbelief . <p> Yes , it 's true . I , Jaine Austen , a woman whose idea of a Mexican vacation is a two-for-one Burrito Day at Taco Bell , was about to head off on my first cruise to Mexico . Or , as we cognoscenti say , Me-hi-co ! And the best thing was , it was absolutely free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times from a cruise company looking for lecturers , and much to my surprise and delight , they 'd hired me . All I had to do was teach a few lessons on Writing Your Life Story , and the generous folks at Holiday Cruise Lines were picking up my tab . <p> " But , Jaine , " Lance pointed out , " the average age on these cruises is dead . How do you expect to meet anybody ? " <p> " I 'm not going on the cruise to meet anybody . I 'm going for the adventure , the scenery , the Latin culture . " <p> Oh , who was I kidding ? I was going for the twenty-four-hour buffet . Imagine ! Dessert on tap any time day or night . Talk about heaven . <p> " Gaack ! You ca n't possibly be taking that , " Lance said , pointing to a perfectly serviceable Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs T-shirt . " They 'll make you walk the plank in that thing . " <p> " This happens to be a collector 's item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , " he sniffed right back . <p> Some people just do n't appreciate kitsch . <p> " I 'm sorry I ca n't take you to the pier like I was supposed to , " he said , grimacing at a pair of my elastic-waist shorts , " but I 've got to be at work in a half hour . " <p> " That 's okay . It 's not your fault I 'm running so late , " I said , eyeing my cat , Prozac , who was perched atop my dresser . " A certain someone took a tinkle on my open suitcase this morning . Which meant I had to run out and buy a new suitcase and do an emergency load of laundry , which slowed me down a good hour or three . " <p> Prozac glared down at me through slitted eyes that seemed to say : <p> You 're lucky it was just a tinkle . <p> " Poor thing is upset that you 're going away , " Lance tsked . <p> " Upset ? That 's putting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see why you 're making such a fuss , Pro . After all , Grandma and Grandpa are flying in all the way from Florida to take care of you . " <p> Her tail twitched the way it always does when she 's on the warpath . <p> Your parents are not my " grandma " and " grandpa . " And if your mother tries to put a bow in my hair like she did the last time , I wo n't be held responsible for the consequences . <p> " Hey , I 'd better get going , " Lance said , springing up from my bed , " or I 'll be late for work . Which reminds me , we 're having a sale on Jimmy Choo . Want me to pick up a pair for you ? " <p> Lance , who is gainfully employed as a shoe salesman at Neiman Marcus , can never seem to remember that the only thing I can afford from Jimmy Choo is his box . <p> " No , thanks . " I smiled wanly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking me in his arms for a farewell hug . " Have fun on the poop deck , whatever the heck that is . " <p> After Lance left to fondle rich ladies ' feet at Neiman 's , I finished packing , all the while dreaming of seven days lolling in a deck chair and soaking up the sun . When I was done , I turned to Prozac , who was still glaring at me from her perch atop my dresser . <p> " So long , sweetheart , " I said , scooping her in my arms . " You be good now , hear ? " <p> Yeah , right . Whatever . <p> Wriggling free from my grasp , she leapt onto my bedspread , which she began clawing with a vengeance . I 'd be surprised if it was still in one piece when I got back . <p> I picked up my bags and headed out to the living room , fighting back waves of guilt . In spite of Prozac 's abominable behavior , I felt bad about leaving her . What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a hopeless sap , mere putty in her paws . <p> Oh , well . I could n't fret . Prozac would be fine . My mother would stuff her with human tuna and spoil her rotten . <p> I took one last look around my apartment , bidding farewell to my overstuffed sofa and my straggly philodendron plant , then headed outside . <p> It was a glorious day , complete with crayon-blue skies , fluffy white clouds , and palm fronds rustling in the breeze . What perfect weather to set sail for the high seas . Luckily I 'd nabbed a parking spot in front of my duplex . I loaded my suitcase and tote bag in the trunk of my car and was just about to shut the lid when I realized I 'd forgotten to pack my Giant Book of New York Times Crossword Puzzles , which I intended to work my way through during my seven days at sea , a succession of free strawberry smoothies at my side . <p> With a sigh of impatience , I dashed back to my apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedspread and was now busily attacking my pillow . I could 've sworn I 'd left the crossword book on my night table , but it was n't there . <p> I looked in the living room , the bathroom , and kitchen , and was about to give up when I finally saw it peeking out from under the living room sofa . No doubt Prozac had hidden it there-just her thoughtful way of saying " bon voyage . " <p> I grabbed it and raced back out to the Corolla , where I tossed it into the trunk and got behind the wheel , excitement mounting . At last I was headed off for a fabulous week of cruising ! <p> Bidding adieu to the cares and woes of my workaday life , I took off with a smile on my lips and a song in my heart . <p> And-what I did n't know at the time-a cat in the trunk of my car . <p> Chapter Two Prozac , the little devil , had undoubtedly slipped out of my apartment while I was dashing around looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd left the front door open . <p> Now as I opened the trunk of my car in the pier 's parking lot , she sauntered out from where she 'd been hiding behind my suitcase and looked up at me in triumph . <p> Anchors aweigh ! <p> Oh , Lord . Fifteen minutes till final boarding . There was no way I could possibly get her back to my apartment . And they 'd never let me on board with a cat . <p> Of course , I could always come clean and confess all . But I was n't about to give up my free cruise . Not to mention my chances of ever working for Holiday Cruise Lines again . Here was my golden opportunity to wow them with my lecture skills , and line up a whole roster of glam cruises around the Pacific . I 'd already mentally booked a twenty-one-day excursion to Tahiti . I simply could n't give all that up and spend the next seven days back in my apartment watching The Weather Channel with my parents . <p> No , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Smuggle Prozac on board . <p> " Okay , kiddo , " I said , plopping her into my tote bag . " You 're about to become a stowaway . " <p> I zipped up the bag , leaving it open just enough so that she 'd get some air . <p> " And if you do n't want Grandma putting bows in your hair for the next week , " I hissed as I made my way to the embarkation area , " then stay put and be quiet . " <p> My palms were sweaty as I handed over my suitcase to a burly baggage handler . I prayed Prozac would n't blow it and start wailing from the tote . But Prozac had obviously gotten the message and was keeping her mouth shut . <p> Once my suitcase was loaded onto a dolly , I headed inside a cavernous barn of a building where passengers were chattering happily , waiting on line to get through security . <p> I quickly called Lance on my cell and left a message on his voice mail , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents I had Prozac with me . Then I took my place at the end of the line , behind a couple with a toddler in a stroller . <p> All was going according to plan as we inched our way to the security scanner . Nary a peep from the tote bag . I was beginning to think I was going to get away with my stowaway scheme when the toddler in front of me shrieked : <p> " Kitty cat ! Kitty cat ! " <p> I looked down , and to my horror , I saw that Prozac had wriggled her head out of the tote and was looking around , surveying the scene . I promptly shoved her back down again . " Mommy ! Mommy ! Kitty cat ! " <p> The kid tugged at his mother 's jeans , getting her attention . She turned around , a harried brunette with an armful of tour books . <p> " What is it , Devon ? " <p> " Kitty cat ! " he screeched at the top of his lungs , in case anybody did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A cat ? " his mom asked , looking around . " Where ? " <p> " Oh , that was Snuffles , " I said , with a moronic giggle . " My stuffed animal . I never go anywhere without Snuffles . It 's a security thing . I 'm working on it in therapy . My therapist says I 'm making very good progress , especially with my new meds .... " <p> I tend to babble when I 'm nervous . <p> " Now , Devon , " the kid 's mother murmured , wheeling the stroller as far away from me as possible , " do n't bother the crazy lady . " <p> Okay , so she did n't call me crazy , but I could tell she was thinking it . <p> By now we 'd reached the security scanner . <p> Holding my breath , I put my tote bag on the conveyor belt . <p> I cringed as I saw it moving from within . I fully expected a zillion alarms would go off and I 'd be arrested as a cat-smuggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now it was my turn to walk through the human scanner . I pasted a sickly smile on my face and stepped inside , my heart racing at Indy 500 speed , guilt oozing from every pore . <p> But the security guy just waved me through with a bored flap of his hand . <p> My heartbeat returned to normal as I retrieved my tote bag and headed outside . I was just about to cross the threshold to freedom when I felt someone clamp my arm in an iron grip . <p> " Just a minute , miss . " <p> I whirled around to face another security guard , a beefy Brunhilde of a woman with biceps the size of volleyballs . <p> The jig was clearly up . Man overboard . Time to walk the plank . <p> " You forgot your crossword puzzles , " she said , handing me my Giant Book of New York Times Crossword Puzzles . <p> I took it from her , my hands trembling with relief . <p> " Have a good trip , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I managed to sputter . <p> Then I stepped outside to the dock , where I got my first glimpse of the Holiday Festival , a sparkling white behemoth of a ship trimmed with gleaming wood railings and lavish balconies . <p> Wow , I thought , gazing up at the beautiful vessel . This was the life ! <p> Down below I could see workers loading crates of food supplies . I only hoped some of them contained chocolate . <p> I headed for the gangplank , where two ship 's officers , handsome Scandinavians clad in white , wanted to see my passport . It was my one final hurdle , and I passed it with flying colors , if you do n't count the nasty scratch Prozac gave me when I reached into my tote for my passport . <p> Operation Stowaway was a success ! <p> At last , my carefree vacation at sea about to begin , I scooted up the gangplank . <p> Of course , if I 'd known the hell that was in store for me , I would 've scooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my cabin was on the Dungeon Deck . Okay , technically , it was called the Paradise Deck , but it was so deep in the bowels of the ship , I practically got the bends riding down in the elevator . <p> But I did n't care . I was thrilled to have made it past security . <p> I was making my way along the corridor , looking for my cabin , when Prozac , clearly irritated at having been cooped up in a tote bag with nothing for company but my hair dryer , sprang out of the bag and began prancing down the corridor . " Stop this instant ! " I commanded in vain , bolting after her . <p> Then , just as I was about to catch her , a woman came out from her cabin , an attractive blonde with the statuesque good looks of a Vegas showgirl . <p> Of all the rotten timing . <p> " What do we have here ? " she cooed , scooping Prozac up in her arms . <p> Instantly Prozac shot her one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strangers , Prozac always manages to turn on the charm . <p> " Oh , god , " I started babbling , " she snuck out of my apartment when I was looking for my crossword puzzles and it was too late to bring her back home so I had to hide her in my tote bag because I could n't give up seven days in the sun with a 24-hour buffet and it was all going so smoothly until I found her in the trunk of my car . The last thing I need on this cruise is Prozac . " <p> " I do n't know about that , honey . You might want to take one of those Prozacs . Sounds like you could use one . " <p> " No , you do n't understand . Prozac is my cat . " <p> " What a sweetheart , " she said , scratching the little monster behind her ears . <p> " You 're not going to tell anyone about her , are you ? They 're sure to quarantine her in some horrible cage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't bear for that to happen . " <p> " Do n't worry , hon. " She flashed me a friendly smile . " Your secret 's safe with me . " <p> " Thank you so much ! " <p> " I 'm Cookie Esposito . I sing with the band in the Sinatra Lounge . " <p> " I 'm Jaine Austen . No relation , " I quickly added , to forestall the question I 've been asked 8,756 times in my life . " I 'm one of the ship 's lecturers . I 'm teaching a course in Writing Your Life Story . " <p> " A writer ! How wonderful ! Welcome to the Paradise Deck , Jaine . This is where they put all the hired hands . C'm on , I 'll walk you to your cabin . " <p> " It 's right here , " I said , spotting my cabin number . <p> " Great ! Right next to mine , " she grinned . " We 'll be neighbors ! " <p> What a stroke of luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get suspicious if she heard meowing in the middle of the night . <p> " If there 's anything you need , just knock on my door . Bye , snookums . " <p> This last endearment was addressed to Prozac , whom she reluctantly handed back to me and then headed off down the corridor . <p> I took the keyless entry pass card I 'd been given and put it in the electronic door lock . A green light flashed , and I turned the handle . <p> Because I was traveling for free , I was n't hoping for anything lavish in the way of accommodations . I 'd kept my expectations low . But apparently not low enough . I blinked in dismay as I stepped into a windowless cubbyhole of a room with all the charm of a broom closet . There was barely room for me and my suitcase , which had been jammed between two narrow twin beds . <p> Prozac surveyed the scene . <p> For this I spent forty minutes in the trunk of your car ? <p> With that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , no doubt hoping to uncover some minced mackerel on the bedspread . <p> Somehow I managed to jam my clothes into the cabin 's microscopic closet , then locked my wallet in the room safe , thrilled that I would n't be needing it for the next seven days . <p> I was about to stretch out on one of the beds for a much deserved rest when I realized that there was only one pillow in the cabin-and Prozac was sprawled on it . <p> " Upsy daisy , " I said , lifting her up . " Mommy needs to rest . " <p> She shot me a laser look . <p> You 're not my mommy and I want my pillow back . <p> I had no sooner rested my head on the pillow when I felt her land with a thud in the general vicinity of my left ear . The next thing I knew , her tail was in my mouth . I gave her a gentle push , and she gave me a not-so-gentle scratch . One thing led to another and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard a knock on the door . <p> " Who is it ? " I called out . <p> A soft unintelligible reply came from out in the corridor . <p> I quickly stashed Prozac in the glorified washbasin posing as my bathroom and poked my head out the door . <p> A skinny guy of indeterminate nationality , dressed in what looked like a bellhop 's uniform , stood in the corridor . <p> " I 'm Samoa , " he said . " Your steward . " <p> At least I think his name was Samoa . His accent was so thick I could n't be sure . <p> " Samoa show you around your cabin . " <p> Not much of a trip there . Besides , I doubted there 'd be room for both of us . <p> " No need , " I said . " I 'm fine . " <p> " You sure ? " <p> His big brown eyes peered over my shoulder into the cabin . In the background I thought I heard Prozac meowing , but thankfully , Samoa did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I assured him . " Just wonderful . " <p> " You need anything , just call Samoa . " <p> What I needed was another pillow , but I could n't risk having him come back to the cabin . <p> " Right . Great . Thanks so much , " I said , shutting the door on his smiling face . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
