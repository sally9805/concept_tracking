The giant local phone companies appear to have escaped unscathed in the telecom crackup . Look again : They may well become the final pillar to crumble . <p> Wall Street has a perverse name for the Baby Bells . They are " cockroaches . " An asteroid has destroyed the whole long-distance and fiber-optic sectors , but somehow the local service providers have survived . Verizon , SBC and BellSouth made a combined $20 billion of profit last year and have a collective market value of $240 billion . <p> So far the Bells ' stamina on Wall Street has been remarkable . The stock prices of Verizon , SBC Communications and BellSouth have fallen on average 30% in two years , easily beating the overall market and trouncing Sprint , Qwest , Level 3 and WorldCom , whose shares are off anywhere from 70% to 100% . Investors sought refuge in what had long been one of the most predictable and reliable businesses on the planet . Local phone service has grown , in good years and bad , for seven decades . <p> Let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy as they appear . While they are n't about to become extinct , neither are they the cash machines they seem to be . Most of those glorious profits are being poured into maintaining equipment or upgrading to meet new competitive threats . In the five years from 1998 through 2002 the Bells will have sunk $140 billion into capital expenses in their local , long-distance , data and international markets . This monstrous outlay will bring them annual revenue growth in those same areas of 2.5% , barely ahead of inflation . Philip Jacobson , an analyst with Network Conceptions in Vienna , Va. , puts it succinctly : " The Bells have shown the ability to invest a lot of money with very little result . " <p> Even as the Bells stand triumphant , the 20th-century foundations of their business have begun to fracture . The Baby Bells could one day be exposed as the last great telecom illusion , undone by a combination of an overwhelming wave of new competition  --  from cable , wireless , resellers and elsewhere  --  and their own underwhelming success at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on a capital-spending treadmill , and the treadmill is picking up speed . <p> Competition and price-cutting that first struck the long-distance business and then cell phone service are now spreading to local service . The Bells ' phenomenal strength is rooted in their absolute lock on the nation 's 180 million local phone lines and the seeming inevitability that , each year , they will continue to lay still more . But last year the total number of local phone lines declined 4.7% from the year before as customers cut off 9 million more lines than they added , according to the Federal Communications Commission . Since AT &T; was founded in 1885 , government stat-isticians have recorded a drop in phone lines only once before , during the Great Depression . <p> The line decline in 2001 was a direct result of the ferocious assault on the Bells from all sides . As many as 3 million customers decided to forgo a home phone last year , going wireless instead . Cable operators are beginning to offer local phone calls on their rebuilt lines , and poached 600,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second phone lines they were using for poky dial-up access to the Internet ; high-speed cable access and DSL do n't interfere with regular phone service , making second lines superfluous . BellSouth workers used to go into new suburbs in the Southeast and confidently bury thick bundles of wires containing 1.5 to 2.5 phone lines for every home in the neighborhood ; this year its workers began burying just one phone line for every home its wires pass . <p> The erosion began to show up last month in BellSouth 's second-quarter report , as sales fell 3.5% and earnings plunged 67% on one-time charges , sending the stock down 18% in a day . Verizon and SBC were also expected to report further phone line losses . <p> It gets worse . The Bells now lease 20 million lines to resellers , up 32% last year , and they 're forced to rent out these precious tendrils at regulated prices that are often just two-fifths what they get from consumer accounts . Competitors leasing those lines can exploit weaknesses in the Bells ' kooky pricing structures , relics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most profitable customers . The Bells count on 95%-plus operating margins on newer features such as caller ID and voice mail to juice their earnings , since basic monthly fees remain regulated . MCI 's new Neighborhood Complete plan offers unlimited local and long-distance calling for $50 or $60 , depending on the region , with caller ID , call waiting and voice mail  --  so valuable to the Bells  --  thrown in free of charge . Since launching the plan in April MCI has landed 600,000 customers and is signing up 200,000 more each month . <p> The Bells will have a hard time holding off the panoply of new competitors , says David Dorman , recently named chief executive of AT &T; and a former chief of Pacific Bell . As newcomers steal the fattest customers , the Bells will get stuck serving the low-spending , high-cost ones . " Inexorably , " he says , " cable and wireless are going to eat into their share . " <p> For six years the Bells have been bracing for this onslaught , steeled by the passage of telecom deregulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance and Internet access . But their foray has been expensive , and the new-growth markets have proven disappointing . The Bells fought hard for the right to sell long-distance service , something they were banned from doing in the 1984 antitrust breakup of AT &T.; It has been a Pyrrhic victory . As of April Verizon and SBC ( the only Bells to have won the right to sell long distance in their home states ) handled long-distance calls for 13.5 million customers , almost double the total of 18 months ago . Yet their long-distance revenue in that same period declined . In the most recent quarter it was $1.5 billion , off 6% in a year and a half ( see chart , below ) . <p> Verizon is the most extreme case of a Bell burning through all its cash just to stay even . By the end of this year the company will have piled up five-year spending of $75 billion sprucing up the networks of its myriad pieces ( the former Bell Atlantic , Nynex and GTE ) . Its revenue will have grown 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , with all of that growth due to an influx of new cellular customers . ( Verizon owns 55% of Verizon Wireless and consolidates the subsidiary on its own financial statements . ) With all that cash plowed into capital projects , Verizon was reduced to issuing new debt to fund $17 billion in dividend payments . Verizon now creaks under $61 billion in total debt , including the money owned by Wireless . Moody 's recently put Verizon on credit watch for possible downgrade from its current A1 rating . <p> The other major Bells ' stories are only slightly better . In the five years between 1998 and the close of this year BellSouth will have put $28 billion into capital expenditures . In return the new investment has let the company increase revenue by 6% a year . SBC will have pumped $52 billion into its core business , to achieve some 2.5% annual growth . <p> Frederic Salerno , vice chairman of Verizon , counters that the last few years " were a bubble in capital spending ... an aberration , " forced by the long-distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open its network and welcome in competitors . Verizon cut capital spending by 45% to $2.4 billion in the first quarter , though Salerno says it continues to invest in new growth areas . " The loss of access lines is not necessarily a disaster if we are able to do two things , " he says . " The first is adding new service to the remaining lines ; the second is cutting the cost of those services . " <p> <p> Bell executives dismiss the idea that they are in trouble . They say soon-to-materialize growth in the newer pursuits  --  everything from long distance to high-speed Web access to wireless to corporate data-networking  --  will more than offset any losses in local service . SBC 's chief financial officer , Randall Stephenson , argues that stagnating long-distance revenue will begin to flow rapidly as the Bells capture more profitable customers and enter more markets ( collectively , they have thus far won approval to sell long distance in 15 of their home states , home to a third of the country 's population ) . He also says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon turn profitable as the market shakes off its growing pains . In California , after a customer is hooked up , SBC 's operating ( a.k.a . EBITDA ) margin on digital subscriber line ( DSL ) service is 40% . " I go out to a mature territory , and I see a business I like , " he says . <p> Analysts on Wall Street often get captivated by EBITDA  --  earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization . But wise man Warren Buffett says such talk makes him shudder . One of his letters to shareholders asks acerbically , " Does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures ? " This is the essence of the debate over the Bells ' investment value : Defending today 's revenue levels may require forever spending so much on new technology that they never have much in the way of free cash flow-what Buffett calls " owner 's earnings " - with which to pay down debt or pay dividends . Cable television operators have the same problem ( see story , p. 107 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a growing ability to combine local phone service with wireless , long distance and broadband . BellSouth recently introduced the " Complete Choice " plan in the Southeast , bundling local with cell or Internet service . " It reduced churn turnover of high-speed Internet customers by nearly 70% , " says BellSouth Chief Financial Officer Ron M. Dykes . " As we go forward in telecom , churn becomes probably the most important financial indicator , " he adds , which may be why he wo n't say just what BellSouth 's churn is . <p> Meanwhile , the Bells , attentive to the risk of credit downgrades , are hacking expenses and capital spending . SBC cut 11,000 employees in the past year , 5.5% of its payroll . It also is consolidating 450 call centers into only 180 to save $700 million annually . Verizon pared 16,000 , or 6% of its total , and BellSouth cut 4,500 , or 5% . <p> The Bells can make up for their shrinking core by buying up their beaten-down telecom peers . Rather than continue pouring their cash into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply buy growth . Whether to launch a buying binge " is the single biggest strategic issue facing the telecom industry today , " says Luiz Carvalho , a wireless industry analyst with Morgan Stanley . <p> Bankrupt WorldCom has assets on the block at trash-heap prices . Cell phone companies trade for under 20% of their peak market values . VoiceStream , AT &T; Wireless , Sprint PCS and Nextel are all cheap enough to fit in a Bell 's budget . But the window of opportunity wo n't be open long . " If the Bells screw around for a couple years , " warns one top telecom executive , " they wo n't have the currency . " A still bigger problem : Buying wireless or long-distance customers wo n't get them off the capital spending treadmill . <p> Verizon Wireless and Cingular ( co-owned by BellSouth and SBC ) represent the Bells ' one reliable source of revenue growth as their core " wireline " businesses have stagnated . Yet the wireless business has proven a sinkhole for investors , who have had to plow ever more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average wireless user talked 50% more in 2001 than in 2000 , but paid only 5% more for the privilege . With publicly traded wireless stocks off 70% in the past year , Cingular and Verizon Wireless both had to shelve plans to be spun off to the public . <p> Ultimately , the lure of buying into growth businesses may prove overwhelming , as the Bells struggle to replace the business that their new competitors are stealing . Leap Wireless , a San Diego-based Qualcomm spinoff , has pioneered the sale of cell phone service designed specifically to replace local phone lines . Leap now has 1.4 million customers in 40 midsize cities , and a full 26% of them have cut the cord entirely , canceling local phone service to go wireless . Its subscriber base grew 207% in the past year , and the portion who drop Bell service is rising as well . <p> Focusing on 40 lesser markets saves Leap the cost of supporting a nationwide network and competing on crowded turf . Its network now costs less than a penny a minute to operate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 cents , according to Morgan Stanley . ) The Leap model makes it possible to charge a flat fee  --  typically $33 a month  --  and vastly increase usage . Customers talk on Leap 's phones for 20 hours a month , triple the wireless industry average . <p> It is part of a generational shift to wireless , says Leap 's chief executive , Harvey White . " Our demographic is younger , and when people start a household today they simply never bother to get a land line . " Leap 's business model is being mimicked by half a dozen companies around the country . Qwest offers all-you-can-talk service in Minneapolis and Omaha . Alltel 's Boomerang service now serves ten cities , such as Albuquerque and Greensboro , N.C. <p> Since the Bells own stakes in wireless firms , they get back some of the revenue lost to cord-cutters . But it 's a miserable trade . When a Bell customer cuts the cord to go wireless , the company loses about $19 in monthly operating income and picks up only $4 to $6 or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Bells ' wireless arms recapture only a fraction of the cord-cutters , and wireless subscribers generate less cash flow to begin with . <p> <p> Still worse for the Bells than cord-cutting is losing customers to the cable companies . About 1.7 million Americans now get their phone service over cable lines , a hair under 1% of total phone lines . A tiny number , but one that grew 66% last year . In the few markets where cable has been around for over two years , about 20% to 25% of homes tend to sign up , says AT &T.; So far Cox and AT &T; have been the only major cable companies to aggressively push local telephone service , but the cost of equipment needed to let a homeowner talk is falling rapidly . Even their more cautious rivals expect to begin avid pursuit of phone customers in the next two years . <p> The Bells had once hoped to thwart their cable adversaries by getting into the business of delivering rival video service , but in the mid-1990s those dreams smacked into obstacles of cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bells pushed DSL , but even that could ultimately hurt their phone business . DSL is a fat enough pipe to let customers shut off primary lines when they add a modem to the household . The idea is simple : Use an Internet connection to carry a phone call from a home out to the regular phone network . Instead of paying the phone company twice for the same wire , pay once for an Internet connection that carries both voice and data . The only hurdle , a significant one , is to make sure an Internet phone provides a prompt dial tone and rings reliably . <p> Jeffrey Citron , who founded Island ECN and Datek Online , says he has solved those problems . Citron has plowed $19 million of his own money into Vonage , a company that began offering local service over DSL in April . ( It also works with cable modems , cutting the Bells out altogether . ) Vonage offers 500 minutes of local and long-distance calling for $20 a month and unlimited service for $40 . Taking advantage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer 's high-speed Internet connection to carry a call to the Internet , which carries it most of the way to its destination before handing it off to the phone network . Island ECN and Datek Online both hit it big by taking a chunk out of the fat profit margins of Wall Street firms , and Citron sees an opportunity to repeat the feat , this time with the Bells as his target . " The incumbents are ripe for being displaced , and technology has created a naturally disruptive force , " he says . <p> Bell executives dismiss talk of massive erosion in revenue and line growth as scaremongering , and that may comfort the 5.5 million shareholders of Verizon , SBC and BellSouth . But then , similar protestations were lodged by long-distance executives five years ago . Today no one can deny that cellular phones and rampant competition are choking that business to death . Sprint attributed most of its 10% dip in long-distance traffic last quarter to increased cell phone use .
