DOROTHEA LANGE : Bringing Relief to Millions // " Their roots were all torn out , " wrote Dorothea Lange . " The only background they had was a background of utter poverty . . . I had to get my camera to register those things about those people that were more important than how poor they were - their pride , their strength , their spirit . " The people Lange was talking about were the hundreds of thousands of Americans who , in the 1930s , has lost almost everything they owned when their once-rich farmland turned to dust . The pictures she took made the nation aware of their plight and earned her the title " humanitarian with a camera . " // Lange began her photographic career in San Francisco , where she opened a portrait studio . Most of her clients were very rich , and by the end of the 1920s , her business was prospering . But despite the wealth of those who sat before her portrait camera , millions of people were suffering through one of the most difficult times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock market in 1929 had led to the closing of thousands of businesses , throwing much of the nation out of work . People who had been successful suddenly found that they had no jobs and no money . Many became homeless , forced to roam the streets in search of work . // Although Lange continued to take portraits in the comfort of her studio , she grew increasingly aware of the plight of these people . She began spending more and more time roaming the streets photographing them . Actually , she had become bored with taking portraits of the rich . From the moment she started taking her street pictures she realized that she had found her true purpose in photography . She would use her camera to draw attention to the heartbreaking situations of those caught up in what was now known as the Great Depression . // Lange threw herself into her new-found work with a passion . " It was her intention , " stated one of her close friends , " to motivate change with every picture she took . " Soon Lange 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , particularly a man named Roy Stryker . He was head of the Historical Section of the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) . His job was to direct a group of some of the finest photographers in the nation as they captured images documenting the effect of the Depression on one enormous segment of the population in particular : the farmers . // By 1933 American cities were feeling the full effect of the collapse of the stock market . But in the southern plain states another type of disaster was taking place . For two full years that 97-million acre section of the country had gone without rain . The drought was so severe that the once-rich topsoil in such states as Oklahoma , Kansas , Texas , Colorado , and New Mexico turned to dust . When the dust was lifted into the air by the relentless prairie winds , huge storms were created that turned the entire region into a gigantic dust bowl . // With the soil gone , millions of people lost the farms that had been in their families for generations . Hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Oregon , looking for work picking fruit and vegetables . It was a terrible situation that got even worse when , after making the difficult journey , most of the migrants found there was little work for them - and what work there was paid extremely low wages . // Clearly something had to be done . But before that could happen , the government had to be made fully aware of just how desperate the situation had become . That was why the FSA had been created . It was also why Roy Stryker , impressed with Lange 's pictures of the disadvantaged people of San Francisco , offered her a job with his team . What Stryker could not know at the time was that Lange would produce many of the most important pictures of the entire photographic project . // Lange began her work with the FSA in 1935 . For the next six years she photographed the Dust Bowl victims in 22 states . She captured images of families on the road in their battered cars as they tried to make their way West . She photographed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields and orchards . And she took pictures of them as they picked the crops . // From the moment that Lange began taking photographs of the dispossessed people she was aware of the importance of her pictures . She knew that there were people who had criticized the FSA project , stating that it was really a propaganda campaign on behalf of the government 's relief programs . Lange actually welcomed the criticism . By this time she had become convinced that the highest purpose to which the camera could be put was that of bringing about needed change . To Lange , propaganda , put to the right purpose , was both useful and necessary . " Everything , " she later wrote , " is propaganda for what you believe in actually . I do n't see that it could be otherwise . The harder and more deeply you believe in anything , the more in a sense you 're a propagandist . . . I have never been able to come to the conclusion that propaganda is a bad word . " // Lange was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she desired , she would have to earn the trust of the Dust Bowl victims . " I had begun to talk to people I photographed , " she later explained . " For some reason , I do n't know why , the people in the city were silent people , and we never spoke to each other . But in the migrant camps , there were always talkers . This was very helpful to me , and I think it was helpful to them . It gave us a chance to meet on common ground . " // Lange 's friend Roy Partridge described how she put this approach into practice . " She would walk through the field and talk to people , asking simple questions . What are you picking ? . . . How long have been here ? When do you eat lunch ? . . . I 'd like to photograph you , she 'd say , and by now it would be ' sure , why not , ' and they would pose a little , but she would sort of ignore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . Then she would begin to take her pictures . " // The photographs she took in the fields and camps and on the roads captured not only the fear and despair experienced by her subjects , but also the dignity and courage with which most of them endured the conditions that had been forced upon them . Above all there was a compassion and sensitivity in the pictures that lifted them above simple documents of a particular time and place . // Much of this sensitivity was spawned by Lange 's own difficult childhood . She 'd had a bout with polio at the age of 7 that had left her with a permanent limp , and her father had abandoned the family both her and her mother when she was 12 , both of which undoubtedly helped her understand the suffering of others . Her experience in meeting and photographing the homeless and jobless in San Francisco had also affected her deeply . Whatever the cause , Lange 's pictures reveal that she cared deeply about the people in her photographs . // Nowhere is this more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her three children seated in a tent in a migrant worker 's camp . " I did not ask her name or her history , " said Lange . " She told me her age , that she was thirty-two . She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields , and birds that the children killed . She had just sold the tires from the car to buy food . There she sat in that lean-to tent with her children huddled around her , and seemed to know that my pictures might help her , and so she helped me . There was a sort of equality about it . " The photograph , which Lange titled " Migrant Mother , " is today regarded not only as the most outstanding of all the Depression Era pictures but also as one of the most powerful photographs ever taken . // Of all the people that Lange photographed she was most taken with the women and the way in which , despite all that had been lost , they were determined to hold their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of photographs that Lange took of farm wives and mothers , women whom she was convinced were the backbone of the nation . " These are women of the American soil , " she said . " They are a hardy stock . They are the roots of our country . . . They are not our well-advertised women of beauty and fashion ... These women represent a different mode of life . They are of themselves a very great American style . They live with courage and purpose , a part of our tradition . " // Shortly after they were taken , " Migrant Mother " and scores of other of Lange 's photographs were widely published in newspapers and magazines . The pictures quickly captured the attention and emotions of the entire nation . One of the immediate results of the pictures was that local and national government officials , shocked by the conditions under which the displaced families were living , immediately began erecting migrant camps to house them . These camps contained running water , toilet facilities , and other necessities that were sorely lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . Most important , Lange 's photographs called attention to a human disaster that , in the words of one U.S. Congressman who saw them , " must never be repeated in this country again . " Soon Congress began passing relief bills aimed at supplying financial aid to Dust Bowl victims . // The photographs brought about other results as well . The pictures that Lange had taken early on of the family farms turned to dust , for example , had a special impact . Government agricultural experts began initiating programs designed to teach Southwestern farmers how to prevent the soil erosion that had brought on the disaster . Farmers learned how to rotate crops so those that robbed the soil of nutrients would not be planted year after year . They were also taught which crops were actually beneficial to the soil . // Lange 's photographs also affected the world of literature . Author John Steinbeck was so moved by the images that he was motivated to write The Grapes of Wrath , regarded as one of the most powerful books ever written about the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound effect on the world of photography . Dozens of young photographers , influenced by the power of Lange 's images and the changes they inspired , began taking pictures of other conditions they felt needed correcting . // For Lange , the success of the Dust Bowl pictures was an affirmation of what she believed was photography 's greatest gift : its ability to change the way people viewed the world . " The camera , " she stated , " is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera . " //
