Priceline , the company most renowned for reintroducing William Shatner to prime time , has come to represent both what is transformative and what is just plain annoying about the Web . Think of any overhyped Web term or concept : disintermediation . The auction economy . Virtual communities . Stupid TV spots . Priceline , based in Norwalk , Conn. , is a poster child for these and other new- economy cliches , especially the one about how it does n't need to make money today because it will make tons of it someday . Next year . Maybe . <P> The business model  --  allowing customers to name what they are willing to pay for plane tickets , hotel rooms , toothpaste , phone calls to Lithuania and then pocketing any difference between that and the wholesale price  --  is made possible by the Net and some nifty patented transaction software . Only through the Web could you match millions of bids with millions of products , all without a fixed price . <P> Certainly , it is a very cool concept , one that founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that fixed pricing in one form or another has been around since the time of Xerxes for a reason : people like it . As Walker points out , though , myriad products  --  from FedEx shipping , where rates increase with the speed of delivery , to groceries bought with coupons  --  fall into the variable-price category . Thus Walker argues that he is merely pushing an already flexible system to its logical extreme . <P> In the roiling early days of the dotcom economy , this logic made perfect sense to investors , who drove Priceline 's stock to $119 a share . Profits were years away , but that was something that worried your old uncle in the boring old economy . Now , of course , the hottest concept sweeping the Web  --  with the NASDAQ off 26% and e-tailers disappearing faster than Energy Department hard drives  --  is actually making a buck . <P> And last week that prospect got more complicated for Priceline when major airline companies confirmed that they will invest in a website , to be called Hotwire , that will compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , Hotwire will set prices rather than auction airline seats . The news , piled on top of weeks of dotcom doom , punished the stock , which finished the week at $37.97 . <P> So far , Priceline has excelled at liquidating products  --  plane tickets , hotel rooms , conceivably even produce  --  that have what economists call " time sensitivity . " If airlines or hotels do n't sell seats on particular flights or rooms for certain nights , those assets become worthless . Such businesses are a natural fit for Priceline , which formed partnerships with airlines and hotels . Travelers typed in their bids and picked up their tickets , and Priceline took flight , selling 20,000 tickets a day .
