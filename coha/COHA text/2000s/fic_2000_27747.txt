WELDING WITH CHILDREN Tuesday was about typical . My four daughters , not a one of them married , you understand , brought over their kids , one each , and explained to my wife how much fun she was going to have looking after them again . But Tuesday was her day to go to the casino , so guess who got to tend the four babies ? My oldest daughter also brought over a bed rail that the end broke off of . She wanted me to weld it . Now , what the hell you can do in a bed that 'll cause the end of a iron rail to break off is beyond me , but she ca n't afford another one on her burger- flipping salary , she said , so I got to fix it with four little kids hanging on my coveralls . Her kid is seven months , nicknamed Nu-Nu , a big-head baby with a bubbling tongue always hanging out his mouth . My second-oldest , a flight attendant on some propeller airline out of Alexandria , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no nickname . My third-oldest , who is still dating , dropped off Tammynette , also six , and last to come was Freddie , my favorite because he looks like those old photographs of me when I was seven , a round head with copper bristle for hair , cut about as short as Velcro . He 's got that kind of papery skin like me , too , except splashed with a handful of freckles . When everybody was on deck , I put the three oldest in front the TV and rocked Nu-Nu off and dropped him in the Portacrib . Then I dragged the bed rail and the three awake kids out through the trees , back to my tin workshop . I tried to get something done , but Tammynette got the big grinder turnedon and jammed a file against the stone just to laugh at the sparks . I got the thing unplugged and then started to work , but when I was setting the bed rail in the vise and clamping on the ground wire from the welding machine , I leaned against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracker box and struck a blue arc on the zipper of my coveralls , low . I jumped back like I was hit with religion and tore those coveralls off and shook the sparks out of my drawers . Moonbean opened her goat eyes wide and sang , " Whoo . Grendaddy can bust a move . " I decided I better hold off trying to weld with little kids around . I herded them into the yard to play , but even though I got three acres , there ai n't much for them to do at my place , so I sat down and watched Freddie climb on a Oldsmobile engine I got hanging from a willow oak on a long chain . Tammynette and Moonbean pushed him like he was on a swing , and I yelled at them to stop , but they would n't listen . It was a sad sight , I guess . I should n't have that old greasy engine hanging from that Kmart chain in my side yard . I know better . Even in this central Louisiana town of Gumwood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , trash in the yard is trash in the yard . I make decent money as a now-and-then welder . I think sometimes about how I even went to college once . I went a whole semester to LSU . Worked overtime at a sawmill for a year to afford the tuition and showed up in my work boots to be taught English 101 by a black guy from Pakistan who could n't understand one word we said , much less us him . He did n't teach me a damn thing and would sit on the desk with his legs crossed and tell us to write nonstop in what he called our " portfolios , " which he never read . For all I know , he sent our tablets back to Pakistan for his relatives to use as stove wood . The algebra teacher talked to us with his eyes rolled up like his lecture was printed out on the ceiling . He did n't even know we were in the room , most of the time , and for a month I thought the poor bastard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor was a fat drunk who heated Campbell 's soup on one of those little burners and ate it out the can while he talked . There was about a million of us in that classroom , and I could n't get the hang of what he wanted us to do with the numbers and names . I sat way in the back next to some fraternity boys who called me " Uncle Jed . " Time or two , when I could see the blackboard off on the horizon , I almost got the hang of something , and I was glad of that . I kind of liked the history professor and learned to write down a lot of what he said , but he dropped dead one hot afternoon in the middle of the pyramids and was replaced by a little porch lizard that looked down his nose at me where I sat in the front row . He bit on me pretty good because I guess I did n't look like nobody else in that class , with my short red hair and blue jeans that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got my money 's worth learning about people that do n't have hearts no bigger than bird shot . Tammynette and Moonbean gave the engine a long shove , got distracted by a yellow butterfly playing in a clump of pigweed , and that nine-hundred-pound V-8 kind of ironed them out on the backswing . So I picked the squalling girls up and got everybody inside , where I cleaned them good with Go-Jo . " I want a Icee , " Tammynette yelled while I was getting the motor oil from between her fingers . " I ai n't had a Icee all day . " " You do n't need one every day , little miss , " I told her . " Do n't you got some money ? " She pulled a hand away and flipped her hair with it like a model on TV . " Those things cost most of a dollar . When I was a kid , I used to get a nickel for candy , and that only twice a week . " " Icee , " she yelled in my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen in her dull little voice . She was n't dull in the head ; she just talked low , like a bad cowboy actor . Nu-Nu sat up in the Portacrib and gargled something , so I gathered everyone up , put them in the Caprice , and drove them down to the Gumwood Pak-a-Sak . The baby was in my lap when I pulled up , Freddie tuning in some rock music that sounded like hail on a tin roof . Two guys I know , older than me , watched us roll to the curb . When I turned the engine off , I could barely hear one of them say , " Here comes Bruton and his bastardmobile . " I grabbed the steering wheel hard and looked down on the top of Nu-Nu 's head , feeling like someone just told me my house burned down . I 'm naturally tanned , so the old men could n't see the shame rising in my face . I got out , pretending I did n't hear anything , Nu-Nu in the crook of my arm like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older guy and break his upper plate , but I could see the article in the local paper . I could imagine the memories the kids would have of their grandfather whaling away at two snuff-dripping geezers . I looked them in the eye and smiled , surprising even myself . Bastardmobile . Man . " Hey , Bruton , " the younger one said , a Mr. Fordlyson , maybe sixty-five . " All them kids yours ? You start over ? " " Grandkids , " I said , holding Nu-Nu over his shoes so maybe he 'd drool on them . The older one wore a straw fedora and was nicked up in twenty places with skin cancer operations . He snorted . " Maybe you can do better with this batch , " he told me . I remembered then that he was also a Mr. Fordlyson , the other guy 's uncle . He used to run the hardwood sawmill north of town , was a deacon in the Baptist church , and owned about 1 percent of the pissant bank down next to the gin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , every old man in town who had five dollars in his pocket and an opinion on the tip of his tongue thought the same . I pushed past him and went into the Pak-a-Sak . The kids saw the candy rack and cried out for Mars Bars and Zeroes . Even Nu- Nu put out a slobbery hand toward the Gummy Worms , but I ignored their whining and drew them each a small Coke Icee . Tammynette and Moonbean grabbed theirs and headed for the door . Freddie took his carefully when I offered it . Nu-Nu might be kind of wobble-headed and plain as a melon , but he sure knew what an Icee was and how to go after a straw . And what a smile when that Coke syrup hit those bald gums of his . Right then , Freddie looked up at me with his green eyes in that speckled face and said , " What 's a bastardmobile ? " I guess my mouth dropped open . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " I thought we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are . " " Well , that man said we was in a " " Never mind what he said . You must have misheard him . " I nudged him toward the door and we went out . The older Mr. Fordlyson was watching us like we were a parade . I was trying to look straight ahead . In my mind , the newspaper bore the headline , LOCAL MAN ARRESTED WITH GRANDCHILDREN FOR ASSAULT . I got into the car with the kids and looked back out at the Fordlysons where they sat on a bumper rail , sweating through their white shirts and staring at us all . Their kids owned sawmills , ran fast-food franchises , were on the school board . They were all married . I guess the young Fordlysons were smart , though looking at that pair , you 'd never know where they got their brains . I started my car and backed out onto the highway , trying not to think , but to me the word was spelled out in chrome script on my fenders : BASTARDMOBILE . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's straw , and he jerked it away and called her something I 'd only heard the younger workers at the plywood mill say . The words hit me in the back of the head like a brick , and I pulled off the road onto the gravel shoulder . " What 'd you say , boy ? " " Nothing . " But he reddened . I saw he cared what I thought . " Kids your age do n't use language like that . " Tammynette flipped her hair and raised her chin . " How old you got to be ? " I gave her a look . " Do n't you care what he said to you ? " " It 's what they say on the comedy program , " Freddie said . " Everybody says that . " " What comedy program ? " " It comes on after the nighttime news . " " What you doing up late at night ? " He just stared at me , and I saw that he had no idea of what late was . Glendine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the set every night . I pictured him crumpled up on that smelly shag rug his mamma keeps in front of the TV to catch the spills and crumbs . When I got home , I took them all out on our covered side porch . The girls began to struggle with jacks , their little ball bouncing crooked on the slanted floor , Freddie played tunes on his Icee straw , and Nu-Nu fell asleep in my lap . I stared at my car and wondered if its name had spread throughout the community , if everywhere I drove people would call out , " Here comes the bastardmobile . " Gumwood is one of those towns where everybody looks at everything that moves . I do it myself . If my neighbor Miss Hanchy pulls out of her lane , I wonder , Now , where is the old bat off to ? It 's two-thirty , so her soap opera must be over . I figure her route to the store and then somebody different will drive by and catch my attention , and I 'll think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you watch how you behave , and besides , what 's the alternative ? Nobody giving a flip about whether you live or die ? I 've heard those stories from the big cities about how people will sit in an apartment window six stories up , watch somebody take ten minutes to kill you with a stick , and not even reach for the phone . I started thinking about my four daughters . None of them has any religion to speak of . I thought they 'd pick it up from their mamma , like I did from mine , but LaNelle always worked so much , she just had time to cook , clean , transport , and fuss . The girls grew up watching cable and videos every night , and that 's where they got their view of the world , and that 's why four dirty blondes with weak chins from St. Helena Parish thought they lived in a Hollywood soap opera . They also thought the married pulpwood truck drivers and garage mechanics they dated were movie stars . I guess a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do n't know what I could 've done different . Moonbean raked in a gaggle of jacks , and a splinter from the porch floor ran up under her nail . " Shit dog , " she said , wagging her hand like it was on fire and coming to me on her knees . " Do n't say that . " " My finger hurts . Fix it , Paw-Paw . " " I will if you stop talking like white trash . " Tammynette picked up on fivesies . " Mamma 's boyfriend , Melvin , says shit dog . " " Would you do everything your mamma 's boyfriend does ? " " Melvin can drive , " Tammynette said . " I 'd like to drive . " I got out my penknife and worked the splinter from under Moonbean 's nail while she jabbered to Tammynette about how her mamma 's Toyota cost more than Melvin 's teeny Dodge truck . I swear I do n't know how these kids got so complicated . When I was their age , all I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek . I did n't want anything but a twice-a-week nickel to bring to the store . These kids ai n't eight years old and already know enough to run a casino . When I finished , I looked down at Moonbean 's brown eyes , at Nu-Nu 's pulsing head . " Does your mammas ever talk to y'all about , you know , God ? " " My mamma says God when she 's cussing Melvin , " Tammynette said . " That 's not what I mean . Do they read Bible stories to y'all at bedtime ? " Freddie 's face brightened . " She rented Conan the Barbarian for us once . That movie kicked ass . " " That 's not a Bible movie , " I told him . " It ai n't ? It 's got swords and snakes in it . " " What 's that got to do with anything ? " Tammynette came close and grabbed Nu-Nu 's hand and played the fingers like they were piano keys . " Ai n't the Bible full of swords and snakes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to go for a plastic diaper . On the way back from the bathroom , I saw our little book rack out the corner of my eye . I found my old Bible stories hardback and brought it out on the porch . It was time somebody taught them something about something . They gathered round , sitting on the floor , and I got down amongst them . I started into Genesis and how God made the earth , and how he made us and gave us a soul that would live forever . Moonbean reached into the book and put her hand on God 's beard . " If he shaved , he 'd look just like that old man down at the Pak-a-Sak , " she said . My mouth dropped a bit . " You mean Mr. Fordlyson ? That man do n't look like God . " Tammynette yawned . " You just said God made us to look like him . " " Never mind , " I told them , going on into Adam and Eve and the Garden . Soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to squeal . " Look at the size of that sucker , " Freddie said . Tammynette wiggled closer . " I knew they was a snake in this book . " " He 's a bad one , " I told them . " He lied to Adam and Eve and said not to do what God told them to do . " Moonbean looked up at me slow . " This snake can talk ? " " Yes . " " How about that . Just like on cartoons . I thought they was making that up . " " Well , a real snake ca n't talk , nowadays , " I explained . " Ai n't this garden snake a real snake ? " Freddie asked . " It 's the devil in disguise , " I told them . Tammynette flipped her hair . " Aw , that 's just a old song . I heard it on the reddio . " " That Elvis Presley tune 's got nothing to do with the devil making himself into a snake in the Garden of Eden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat back in the dust by the weatherboard wall and stared out at my overgrown lawn . " He 's some old singer died a million years ago , " Tammynette told her . " Was he in the Bible , too ? " I beat the book on the floor . " No , he ai n't . Now pay attention . This is important . " I read the section about Adam and Eve disobeying God , turned the page , and all hell broke loose . An angel was holding a long sword over Adam and Eve 's downturned heads as he ran them out of the Garden . Even Nu-Nu got excited and pointed a finger at the angel . " What 's that guy doing ? " Tammynette asked . " Chasing them out of Paradise . Adam and Eve did a bad thing , and when you do bad , you get punished for it . " I looked down at their faces and it seemed that they were all thinking about something at the same time . It was scary , the little sparks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at this age stays forever . You got to be careful . Freddie looked up at me and asked , " Did they ever get to go back ? " " Nope . Eve started worrying about everything and Adam had to work every day like a beaver just to get by . " " Was that angel really gon na stick Adam with that sword ? " Moonbean asked . " Forget about that darned sword , will you ? " " Well , that 's just mean " is what she said . " No it ai n't , " I said . " They got what was coming to them . " Then I went into Noah and the Flood , and in the middle of things , Freddie piped up . " You mean all the bad people got drownded at once ? All right ! " I looked down at him hard and saw that the Bible was turning into one big adventure film for him . Freddie had already watched so many movies that any religion he would hear about would nest in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death Squad . I got everybody a cold drink and jelly sandwiches , and after that I turned on a window unit , handed out Popsicles , and we sat inside on the couch because the heat had waked up the yellow flies outside . I tore into how Abraham almost stabbed Isaac , and the kids ' eyes got big when they saw the knife . I hoped that they got a sense of obedience to God out of it , but when I asked Freddie what the point of the story was , he just shrugged and looked glum . Tammynette , however , had an opinion . " He 's just like O. J. Simpson ! " Freddie shook his head . " Naw . God told Abraham to do it just as a test . " " Maybe God told O. J. to do what he did , " Tammynette sang . " Naw . O. J. did it on his own , " Freddie told her . " He did n't like his wife no more . " " Well , maybe Abraham did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na kill him dead and God stopped him . " Tammynette 's voice was starting to rise the way her mother 's did when she 'd been drinking . " Daddies do n't kill their sons when they do n't like them , " Freddie told her . " They just pack up and leave . " He broke apart the two halves of his Popsicle and bit one , then the other . Real quick , I started in on Sodom and Gomorrah and the burning of the towns full of wicked people . Moonbean was struck with Lot 's wife . " I saw this movie once where Martians shot a gun at you and turned you into a statue . You reckon it was Martians burnt down those towns ? " " The Bible is not a movie , " I told her . " I think I seen it down at Blockbuster , " Tammynette said . I did n't stop to argue , just pushed on through Moses and the Ten Commandments , spending a lot of time on number six , since that one give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rub his nose with the backs of his hands and started to tune up , so I knew it was time to put the book down and wash faces and get snacks and play crawl-around . I was determined not to turn on TV again , but Freddie hit the button when I was in the kitchen . When Nu-Nu and me came into the living room , they were in a half circle around a talk show . On the set were several overweight , tattooed , frowning , slouching individuals who , the announcer told us , had tricked their parents into signing over ownership of their houses , and then evicted them . The kids watched like they were looking at cartoons , which is to say , they gobbled it all up . At a commercial , I asked Moonbeam who has the softest heart , what she thought of kids that threw their parents in the street . She put a finger in an ear and said through a long yawn that if the parents did mean things , then the kids could do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in the kitchen , found the Christmas vodka , and poured myself a long drink . I stared out in the yard to where my last pickup truck lay dead and rusting in a pile of wisteria at the edge of the lot . I formed a little fantasy about gathering all these kids into my Caprice and heading out north- west to start over , away from their mammas , TVs , mildew , their casino-mad grandmother , and Louisiana in general . I could get a job , raise them right , send them to college so they could own sawmills and run car dealerships . A drop of sweat rolled off the glass and hit my right shoe , and I looked down at it . The leather lace-ups I was wearing were paint-spattered and twenty years old . They told me I had n't held a steady job in a long time , that whatever bad was gon na happen was partly my fault . I wondered then if my wife had had the same fantasy : leaving her scruffy , sunburned , failed-welder husband home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course in clerical skills and getting a job in Utah , raising them right , sending them off to college . Maybe even each of their mammas had the same fantasy , pulling their kids out of their parents ' gassy-smelling old house and heading away from the heat and humidity . I took another long swallow and wondered why one of us did n't do it . I looked out to my Caprice sitting in the shade of a pecan tree , shadows of leaves moving on it , making it wiggle like a dark green flame , and I realized we could n't drive away from ourselves . We could n't escape in the bastardmobile . In the pantry , I opened the house 's circuit panel and rotated out a fuse until I heard a cry from the living room . I went in and pulled down a storybook , something about a dog chasing a train . My wife bought it twenty years ago for one of our daughters but never read it to her . I sat in front of the dark television . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rasped . " It died , " I said , opening the book . They squirmed and complained , but after a few pages they were hooked . It was a good book , one I 'd read myself one afternoon during a thunderstorm . But while I was reading , this blue feeling got me . I was thinking , What 's the use ? I 'm just one old man with a little brown book of Bible stories and a doggy-hero book . How can that compete with daily MTV , kids ' programs that make big people look like fools , the Playboy Channel , the shiny magazines their mammas and their boyfriends leave around the house , magazines like Me , and Self , and Love Guides , and rental movies where people kill one another with no more thought than it would take to swat a fly , nothing at all like what Abraham suffered before he raised that knife ? But I read on for a half hour , and when that dog stopped the locomotive before it pulled the passenger train over the collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , I did n't have much on the welding schedule , so after one or two little jobs , including the bed rail that my daughter called and ragged me about , I went out to pick up a window grate the town marshal wanted me to fix . It was hot right after lunch , and Gumwood was wiggling with heat . Across from the cypress railroad station was our little redbrick city hall with a green copper dome on it , and on the grass in front of that was a pecan tree with a wooden bench next to its trunk . Old men sometimes gathered under the cool branches and told one another how to fix tractors that had n't been made in fifty years , or how to make grits out of a strain of corn that did n't exist anymore . That big pecan was a landmark , and locals called it the " Tree of Knowledge . " When I walked by going to the marshal 's office , I saw the older Mr. Fordlyson seated in the middle of the long bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out to me . " Bruton , " he said . " Too hot to weld ? " I did n't think it was a friendly comment , though he waved for me to come over . " Something like that . " I was tempted to walk on , but he motioned for me to sit next to him , which I did . I looked across the street for a long time . " The other day at the store , " I began , " you said my car was a bastardmobile . " Fordlyson blinked twice but did n't change his expression . Most local men would be embarrassed at being called down for a lack of politeness , but he sat there with his face as hard as a plowshare . " Is that not what it is ? " he said at last . I should have been mad , and I was mad , but I kept on . " It was a mean thing to let me hear . " I looked down and wagged my head . " I need help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me with his little nickel-colored eyes glinting under that straw fedora with the black silk hatband . " What kind of help you need ? " I picked up a pecan that was still in its green pod . " I 'd like to fix it so those grandkids do right . I 'm thinking of talking to their mammas and " " Too late for their mammas . " He put up a hand and let it fall like an ax . " They 'll have to decide to straighten out on their own or not at all . Nothing you can tell those girls now will change them a whit . " He said this in a tone that hinted I was stupid for not seeing this . Dumb as a post . He looked off to the left for half a second , then back . " You got to deal directly with those kids . " " I 'm trying . " I cracked the nut open on the edge of the bench . " Tryin ' wo n't do shit . You got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to church ? " " Yeah . " " Do n't eat that green pecanit 'll make you sick . Which church you go to ? " " Bonner Straight Gospel . " He flew back as though he 'd just fired a twelve-gauge at the dog sleeping under the station platform across the street . " Bruton , your wild-man preacher is one step away from taking up serpents . I 've heard he lets the kids come to the main service and yells at them about frying in hell like chicken parts . You got to keep them away from that man . Why do n't you come to First Baptist ? " I looked at the ground . " I do n't know . " The old man bobbed his head once . " I know damned well why not . You wo n't tithe . " That hurt deep . " Hey , I do n't have a lot of extra money . I know the Baptists got good Sunday-school programs , but ... " Fordlyson waved a finger in the air like a little sword . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He pointed up the street . " Join those Catholics . Some of them do n't put more than a dollar a week in the plate , but there 's so many of them , and the church has so many services a weekend , the priests can run the place on volume like Wal-Mart . " I knew several good mechanics who were Methodists . " How 's the Methodists ' children 's programs ? " The old man spoke out of the side of his mouth . " Better'n you got now . " " I 'll think about it , " I told him . " Yeah , bullshit . You 'll go home and weld together a log truck , and tomorrow you 'll go fishing , and you 'll never do nothing for them kids , and they 'll all wind up serving time in Angola or on their backs in New Orleans . " It got me hot the way he thought he had all the answers , and I turned on him quick . " Okay , wise man . I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He pulled down one finger on his right hand with the fore- finger of the left . " Go join the Methodists . " Another finger went down and he told me , " Every Sunday , bring them children to church . " A third finger , and he said , " And keep ' em with you as much as you can . " I shook my head . " I already raised my kids . " Fordlyson looked at me hard and did n't have to say what he was thinking . He glanced down at the ground between his smooth-toe lace-ups . " And clean up your yard . " " What 's that got to do with anything ? " " It 's got everything to do with everything . " " Why ? " " If you do n't know , I ca n't tell you . " Here he stood up , and I saw his daughter at the curb in her Lincoln . One leg would n't straighten all the way out , and I could see the pain in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mean little smile and leaned in to me for a second and said , " Bruton , everything worth doing hurts like hell . " He toddled off and left me with his sour breath on my face and a thought forming in my head like a rain cloud . After a session with the Methodist preacher , I went home and stared at the yard , then stared at the telephone until I got up the strength to call Famous Amos Salvage . The next morning , a wrecker and a gondola came down my road , and before noon , Amos loaded up four derelict cars , six engines , four washing machines , ten broken lawn mowers , and two and one-quarter tons of scrap iron . I begged and borrowed Miss Hanchy 's Super- A and bush-hogged the three acres I own and then some . I cut the grass and picked up around the workshop . With the money I got from the scrap , I bought some aluminum paint for the shop and some first-class stuff for the outside of the house . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the little porch , and on the big porch on the side , I began putting down a heavy coat of glossy green deck enamel . At lunch , my wife stuck her head through the porch door to watch me work . " The kids are coming over again . How you gon na keep ' em off of all this wet paint ? " My knees were killing me , and I could n't figure how to keep Nu-Nu from crawling where he should n't . " I do n't know . " She looked around at the wet glare . " What 's got into you , changing our religion and all ? " " Time for a change , I guess . " I loaded up my brush . She thought about this a moment , then pointed . " Careful you do n't paint yourself in a corner . " " I 'm doing the best I can . " " It 's about time , " she said under her breath , walking away . I backed off the porch and down the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , painting the ends of the porch boards . I heard a car come down the road and watched my oldest daughter drive up and get out with Nu-Nu over her shoulder . When she came close , I looked at her dyed hair , which was the color and texture of fiberglass insulation , the dark mascara , and the olive skin under her eyes . She smelled of cigarette smoke , stale smoke , like she had n't had a bath in three days . Her tan blouse was tight and tied in a knot above her navel , which was a lardy hole . She passed Nu-Nu to me like he was a ham . " Can he stay the night ? " she asked . " I want to go hear some music . " " Why not ? " She looked around slowly . " Looks like a bomb hit this place and blew everything away . " The door to her dusty compact creaked open , and a freckled hand came out . " I forgot to mention that I picked up Freddie on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She did n't look at him as she mumbled this , hands on her cocked hips . Freddie , who had been sleeping , I guess , sat on the edge of the car seat and rubbed his eyes like a drunk . " He 'll be all right here , " I said . She took in a deep , slow breath , so deathly bored that I felt sorry for her . " Well , guess I better be heading on down the road . " She turned , then whipped around on me . " Hey , guess what ? " " What ? " " Nu-Nu finally said his first word yesterday . " She was biting the inside of her cheek . I could tell . I looked at the baby , who was going after my shirt buttons . " What 'd he say ? " " Da-da . " And her eyes started to get red , so she broke and ran for her car . " Wait , " I called , but it was too late . In a flash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing toward the most cigarette smoke , music , and beer she could find in one place . I took Freddie and the baby around to the back steps by the little screen porch and sat down . We tickled and goo-gooed at Nu-Nu until finally he let out a " Da-da " real loud , like a call . Freddie looked back toward the woods , at all the nice trees in the yard , which looked like what they were now that the trash had been carried off . " What happened to all the stuff ? " " Gone , " I said . " We gon na put a tire swing on that tall willow oak there , first off . " " All right . Can you cut a drain hole in the bottom so the rainwater wo n't stay in it ? " He came close and put a hand on top of the baby 's head . " Yep . " " A big steel-belt tire ? " " Sounds like a plan . " Nu-Nu looked at me and yelled , " Da- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that in one way or another for the rest of his life and never be able to face the fact that Da-da had skipped town , whoever Da-da was . The baby brought me in focus , somebody 's blue eyes looking at me hard . He blew spit over his tongue and cried out , " Da-da , " and I put him on my knee , facing away toward the cool green branches of my biggest willow oak .
