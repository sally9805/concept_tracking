S he had never lived in a house and now , seeing the thing , she was no longer sure she wanted to . It was the right house , she knew it was . It was as he had described . She shielded her eyes as she drove the long slope , her truck jolting and bucking as she approached . The bottomland yawned into view and she saw the fields where the young tobacco faltered on the drybeat earth , the ridge beyond . All around the soil had leached to chalky dust under the sun . She looked for the newer , smaller house that Orren had told her of , but she did not see it , only the old listing structure before her and the fields and the slope of tall grasses that fronted the house . She parked her truck and stared , her tongue troubled the inside of her teeth . The house cast no shadow in the bare noon light . <p> The ragged porch clung weakly to the wall of the building , its floorboards lining out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first undressed them . When she tested a board with one foot , the wood ached and sounded under her , but did not move . She picked her way around a mudspattered posthole digger and a length of chicken wire to reach the door where she found a paper heart taped to the wood . The shape of the thing gave her pause . She read the note without touching it . <p> Aloma , <p> If you come when I 'm gone , the tractor busted and I went <p> to Hansonville for parts . Go on in . I will come back soon , <p> Orren <p> In this house , she thought , or the new one ? She straightened up and hesitated . Over her head a porch fan hung spinless , trailing its cobwebs like old hair , its spiders gone . She turned to peer behind her down the gravel drive . Displaced dust still hung close behind the fender of her truck , loath to lie down in boredom again . It was quiet , both on the buckling blacktop road where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and here on the porch where the breezeless day was silent . A few midday insects spoke and that was all . She turned around and walked into the house . <p> If it was abandoned , it was not empty . Curtains hung bleached to gray and tattered rugs scattered across the floor . Against one wall , nestled under the rise of a staircase and a high landing , stood an old upright piano . One sulling eyebrow rose . Orren had told her of a piano on the property , one she could practice on , but it could not be this . Aloma edged past its sunken frame , leaving it untouched , and walked back through a dining room washed in south light past a table papered with bills and letters , into the kitchen . The ceiling here was high and white . It seemed clean mostly because it was empty  --  spacious and empty as a church . She circled the room , tugged open drawers and cabinets , but her eyes stared at their contents unseeing , her mind wheeling backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first room . She tossed back the fallboard and reached her fingers to the ivory . The keys stuttered to the bed , fractionally apart beneath her fingers , and it was no more , no less than she had expected . The sound was spoiled like a meat . She slapped the fallboard down , wood on wood clapped out into the echoing house in cracking waves , and then it was gone . She turned away with the air of someone halfheartedly resigned to endure , but as she turned , she started and stopped . A wall of faces stood before her , photographs in frames armied around a blackened mantel , eyes from floor to ceiling . She studied them without stepping closer . They gazed back . <p> She left the room as quick as she had come , retraced her steps to the kitchen where she had spied a door that led outside . She opened it wide to the June day . From where she stood , she claimed a long view of the back property . A field of tobacco began down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field neighbored close by , its beds risen like new graves . There a black curing barn stood and from its rafters a bit of tobacco hung like browned bird wings , pinions down , too early and out of season , she could not say why . To her left another barn , this one red , with a large gated pen and a gallery on one side . The pasture was empty . The cows had all wandered up a hillside to a stand of brazen green trees and stood blackly on the fringe of its shade gazing out , their bodies in the cloaking dark but their heads shined to a high gloss like black pennies in the sunlight . Far below their unmoving faces the newer house pointed south , no larger than a doublewide , no taller , no prettier . It banked the barbed edge of the cows ' pasture . But none of this held Aloma 's gaze for more than a moment . Instead , she looked out into the distance where , because she could not will them away or otherwise erase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains stood . She laughed a laugh without humor . All her hopes , and there they were . Had they been any closer , she 'd have suffered to hear them laughing back . <p> Excerpted from All the Living by C. E. Morgan . <p> Copyright 2009 by C. E.
