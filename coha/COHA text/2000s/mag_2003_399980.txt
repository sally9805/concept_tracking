For the 13th year in a row , The Children 's Better Health Institute will host The Tulip Time Scholarship Games . This year 's event will be held April 26 at the Fitness Farm , 2525 West 44th Street , Indianapolis , IN 46228 . Our special guest this year will be Jared Fogle , spokesman for Subway Restaurants who lost 245 pounds by eating a diet of Subway sandwiches . Here is a listing of this year 's events : Track The beautiful 200-meter Fitness Farm oval track will feature various track events this year , and as always , we divide each event by age groups . Last year , Child Life readers ran in either the 800-meter event for nine- and ten-year-olds or the separate one-mile cross  --  country events for boys and girls ages Photograph A-a-and they 're off ! Moms ( and dads , too ) can compete to win scholarships for their young participants at the Tulip Time Scholarship Games . // eleven and twelve . For all ages , there was the Predicted Time Race , in which you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ( best of all ! ) there were the Moms ' and Dads ' races to see which parent could win a college scholarship for their enrolled participants . We expect to have the parent races this year as well , and yes , it 's always a hoot to see the middle-aged parents race around the track ! Swimming We started our freestyle swimming events two years ago at the Fitness Farm , and they have been a big success ! The nine-to-ten and eleven-to-twelve age groups have swum for seventy-five and 100 yards , respectively . Biathlon Here 's where we separate the athletes from the wannabes ! All participants must run a mile and then swim a distance . Distances swum in the Biathlon depend on the age group and are the same as those in the regular swimming contests . ( For example , nine-year-olds usually swim 75 yards in the Biathlon , the same as they would for a regular swimming contest . ) Better eat your Wheaties that morning ! Other Sports No Tulip Time Games would be complete without our yearly Hot-Shot Basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baskets from various distances . But if basketball is n't your thing , you can always try Hot-Foot Soccer , where you dribble balls through cones before scoring a goal . There 's also Accu-Shot Golf ( try to sink putts ) or Target Tennis ( hit balls for points ) . Watch out for flying objects ! Spelling Bee The perennial favorite of athletes and nonathletes alike . Again , words will be divided according to age group , and whoever spells the last word correctly wins . Hint : You may want to study words for the age group above you , if possible . That 's how we eliminate ties at the end of each round . This event tends to be a real barn-burner every year . See page 8 for a word-search puzzle to help you study , or go to our Web site ( www.childlifemag.org ) for a complete list of this year 's spelling words .
