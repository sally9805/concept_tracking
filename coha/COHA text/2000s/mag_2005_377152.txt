THERE ARE FEW SURER WAYS TO WIN ratings than to level a city in a fictional earthquake or crash an asteroid into the planet . Mindless TV disaster epics are a sweeps staple . But toward the end of the cold war , there flourished a high-minded subgenre : the Very Special Disaster Movie  --  VSDM . In the ' 80s , such shows as The Day After , Special Bulletin , Threads and Testament told what-if stories about nuclear attacks and their aftermaths . With the fall of the Berlin Wall , the networks ' interest in atomic catastrophes disappeared , even if the nukes did n't . <P> Today , given the interest in catastrophe  --  man-made or natural , radiological or biological , by land or by air  --  it 's surprising that the big networks have not revived the VSDM . Perhaps they fear bumming viewers out . Perhaps , in the age of fragmentation , they do n't feel those movies can get the attention The Day After did when it drew about 100 million viewers in 1983 . But now cable has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly timely  --  one intentionally , one accidentally . <P> The intentionally relevant one is HBO 's Dirty War ( Jan. 24 , 9 p.m . E.T. ) , about a dirty bomb ( a device packed with radioactive material that renders an area uninhabitable with its fallout ) set off in London . The film was co-written and directed by Daniel Percival , a one-man VSDM industry ; he also created Smallpox , a chilling mockumentary that aired this month on FX . Dirty War opens on a sight familiar from the news , an attack-simulation drill . The test is a sham  --  the responders are badly underequipped , and the casualty numbers are fudged  --  but the Minister for London ( Helen Schlesinger ) reports success , to " protect " the people from the truth . <P> And that is the happy part of the movie . Things get darker as a real dirty truck bomb goes off in the city 's center . There is far more devastation than the drill projected . The response is chaotic : workers are trapped in burning offices as rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the heroism and derring-do that follow only remind us that the real time for lifesaving action ended long before . <P> If Dirty War can be didactic and self-congratulatory , it also smartly balances a thriller 's plotting with an astute eye for politics and bureaucratic idiocy . Whether you consider it a gripping , worthy scare or titillating scaremongering may depend on whether you think it is a fair warning or a grim preview reel of inevitable coming attractions . For the sake of all of us , if not of the movie , let 's hope it 's the former . <P> The docudrama Pompeii : The Last Day ( Discovery , Jan. 30 , 9 p.m . E.T. ) did not set out to be a VSDM . That changed with the Indian Ocean tsunami , when entire habitations were , like the Roman city in 79 A.D. , erased by a rumbling from beneath the earth 's crust . A BBC co-production ( as is Dirty War ) , Pompeii gives a scientific blow-by-blow of Vesuvius ' eruption . More interestingly  --  and with more resonance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . <P> In particular , it asks , Why did n't people run like hell ? Some did , it turns out , and died anyway . Others stayed , out of fatalism or simply because they did n't know what a volcanic eruption was . They watch thunderstruck as pumice falls from the sky like an otherworldly snowstorm . Later , as superheated ash cascades , it is too late to flee .
