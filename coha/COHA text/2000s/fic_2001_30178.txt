AUTHOR OF THE CENTURY Fantasy and the fantastic The dominant literary mode of the twentieth century has been the fantastic . This may appear a surprising claim , which would not have seemed even remotely conceivable at the start of the century and which is bound to encounter fierce resistance even now . However , when the time comes to look back at the century , it seems very likely that future literary historians , detached from the squabbles of our present , will see as its most representative and distinctive works books like J.R.R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings , and also George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm , William Golding 's Lord of the Flies and The Inheritors , Kurt Vonnegut 's Slaughterhouse-Five and Cat 's Cradle , Ursula Le Guin 's The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed , Thomas Pynchon 's The Crying of Lot-49 and Gravity 's Rainbow . The list could readily be extended , back to the late nineteenth century with H.G. Wells 's The Island of Dr Moreau and The War of the Worlds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and George R.R. Martin . It could take in authors as different , not to say opposed , as Kingsley and Martin Amis , Anthony Burgess , Stephen King , Terry Pratchett , Don DeLillo , and Julian Barnes . By the end of the century , even authors deeply committed to the realist novel have often found themselves unable to resist the gravitational pull of the fantastic as a literary mode . This is not the same , one should note , as fantasy as a literary genre - of the authors listed above , only four besides Tolkien would find their works regularly placed on the ' fantasy ' shelves of bookshops , and ' the fantastic ' includes many genres besides fantasy : allegory and parable , fairy-tale , horror and science fiction , modern ghost-story and medieval romance . Nevertheless , the point remains . Those authors of the twentieth century who have spoken most powerfully to and for their contemporaries have for some reason found it necessary to use the metaphoric mode of fantasy , to write about worlds and creatures which we know do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ' Ingsoc ' , the remote islands of Golding and Wells , or the Martians and Tralfamadorians who burst into peaceful English or American suburbia in Wells and Vonnegut . A ready explanation for this phenomenon is of course that it represents a kind of literary disease , whose sufferers - the millions of readers of fantasy - should be scorned , pitied , or rehabilitated back to correct and proper taste . Commonly the disease is said to be ' escapism ' : readers and writers of fantasy are fleeing from reality . The problem with this is that so many of the originators of the later twentieth-century fantastic mode , including all four of those first mentioned above ( Tolkien , Orwell , Golding , Vonnegut ) are combat veterans , present at or at least deeply involved in the most traumatically significant events of the century , such as the Battle of the Somme ( Tolkien ) , the bombing of Dresden ( Vonnegut ) , the rise and early victory of fascism ( Orwell ) . Nor can anyone say that they turned their backs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of communicating and commenting on them . It is strange that this had , for some reason , in so many cases to involve fantasy as well as realism , but that is what has happened . The continuing appeal of Tolkien 's fantasy , completely unexpected and completely unpredictable though it was , can not then be seen as a mere freak of popular taste , to be dismissed or ignored by those sufficiently well-educated to know better . It deserves an explanation and a defence , which this book tries to supply . In the process , I argue that his continuing appeal rests not on mere charm or strangeness ( though both are there and can again to some extent be explained ) , but on a deeply serious response to what will be seen in the end as the major issues of his century : the origin and nature of evil ( an eternal issue , but one in Tolkien 's lifetime terribly re-focused ) ; human existence in Middle-earth , without the support of divine Revelation ; cultural relativity ; and the corruptions and continuities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to despise , or need be ashamed of studying . It is true that Tolkien 's answers will not appeal to everyone , and are wildly at odds with those given even by many of his contemporaries as listed above . But the first qualification applies to every author who has ever lived , and the second is one of the things that make him distinctive . However , one of the other things that make him distinctive is his professional authority . On some subjects Tolkien simply knew more , and had thought more deeply , than anyone else in the world . Some have felt ( and said ) that he should have written his results up in academic treatises instead of fantasy fiction . He might then have been taken more seriously by a limited academic audience . On the other hand , all through his lifetime that academic audience was shrinking , and has now all but vanished . There is an Old English proverb that says ( in Old English , and with the usual provocative Old English obscurity ) , Ciggendra gehwelc wile t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be heard ! ' ( Here and in a few places later on , I use the old runic letters , and 3 . The first usually represents ' th ' as in ' thin ' , the second ' th ' as in ' then ' . Where the third is used in this book , it represents -3 at the end of a word , - gh-  in the middle of one . ) Tolkien wanted to be heard , and he was . But what was it that he had to say ? Tolkien 's life and work For a full account of Tolkien 's life , one should turn to Humphrey Carpenter 's authorized Biography of 1977 ( full references to this and other works briefly cited in the text can be found on pp. 329-36 below ) . But one could sum it up by noting Carpenter 's surprising turn on p. 111 : ' And after this , you might say , nothing else really happened . ' The turning-point Carpenter refers to as ' this ' was Tolkien 's election to the Rawlinson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was only thirty-three . The exciting events of Tolkien 's life - the stuff most biographers draw on - happened before then . He was born in 1892 , in Bloemfontein , South Africa , of English parents . He returned to England very soon , but his father died when he was four , his mother ( a convert to Roman Catholicism ) when he was twelve . He was brought up in and around Birmingham , and saw himself , despite his foreign birth and German-derived name , as deep-rooted in the counties of the English West Midlands . He met his future wife when he was sixteen and she was nineteen , was eventually forbidden by his guardian to see or correspond with her till he was twenty-one , and wrote proposing marriage to her on his twenty-first birthday . They married while he was at Oxford , but immediately on graduation , in 1915 , he took up a commission in the Lancashire Fusiliers . He served as an infantry subaltern on the Somme from July to October 1916 , and in that year lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gangrene . He was then invalided out with trench fever , worked for a short while after the War for the Oxford English Dictionary , received first a Readership and then a Chair at Leeds University , and then in 1925 the Anglo-Saxon Chair at Oxford . And after this ' nothing else really happened ' . Tolkien did his job , raised his family , wrote his books , pre-eminently The Hobbit , which came out in 1937 , and The Lord of the Rings , published in three volumes in 1954-5 . His main purely academic publications were an edition of the medieval romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight , which he co-edited with E.V . Gordon in 1925 , and his British Academy lecture on Beowulf in 1936 , still accepted as the most significant single essay on the poem out of the ( literally ) thousands written . He retired from his second Oxford Chair in 1959 ( having transferred from the Chair of Anglo-Saxon to the Merton Chair of English Language in 1945 ) . He remained all his life a committed Christian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1973 . No extra-marital affairs , no sexual oddities , no scandals , strange accusations , or political involvements - nothing , in a way , for a poor biographer to get his teeth into . But what that summary misses out ( as Carpenter recognizes ) is the inner life , the life of the mind , the world of Tolkien 's work , which was also - he refused to distinguish the two - his hobby , his private amusement , his ruling passion . If Tolkien had ever been asked to describe himself in one word , the word he would have chosen , I believe , would be ' philologist ' ( see , for instance , the various remarks made in Carpenter 's edition of Tolkien 's Letters , especially p. 264 ) . Tolkien 's ruling passion was philology . This is a word which needs some explanation . I have to state here strong personal involvement . I attended the same school as Tolkien , King Edward 's , Birmingham , and followed something like the same curriculum . In 1979 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Leeds which Tolkien had vacated in 1925 . I confess that I eventually abolished at Leeds the syllabus which Tolkien had set up two generations before , though I think that in the circumstances of the 1980s I got a deal which Tolkien would himself have reluctantly approved . In between Birmingham and Leeds I had spent seven years as a member of the English faculty at Oxford , teaching again almost exactly the same curriculum as Tolkien . We were both enmeshed in the same academic duties , and faced the same struggle to keep language and philology on the English Studies curriculum , against the pressing demands to do nothing but literature , post-medieval literature , the relevant , the realistic , the canonical ( etc . ) . There may accordingly be a certain note of factionalism in what I have to say about philology : but at least Tolkien and I were members of the same faction . In my opinion ( it is one not shared , for instance , by the definitions of the Oxford English Dictionary ) , the essence of philology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language or languages , including dialectal or non-standard forms , and also of related languages . Tolkien 's central field of study was , naturally , Old and Middle English , roughly speaking the forms of English which date from 700 AD to 1100 ( Old ) and 1100 to 1500 ( Middle ) - Old English is often called ' Anglo-Saxon ' , as in the title of Tolkien 's Chair , but Tolkien avoided the term . Closely linked to these languages , however , was Old Norse : there is more Norse in even modern English than people realize , and even more than that in Northern dialects , in which Tolkien took a keen interest . Less closely linked linguistically , but historically connected , are the other ancient languages of Britain , especially Welsh , which Tolkien also studied and admired . However , philology is not and should not be confined to language study . The text in which these old forms of the language survive are often literary works of great power and distinctiveness , and ( in the philological view ) any literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary linguistic toll to be able to read them , is accordingly incomplete and impoverished . Conversely , of course , any study which remains solely linguistic ( as was often the case with twentieth century philology ) is throwing away its best material and its best argument for existence . In philology , literary and linguistic study are indissoluble . They ought to be the same thing . Tolkien said exactly that in his letter of application for the Oxford Chair in 1925 ( see Letters , p. 13 ) , and he pointed to the Leeds curriculum he had set up as proof that he meant it . His aim , he declared , would be : to advance , to the best of my ability , the growing neighbourliness of linguistic and literary studies , which can never be enemies except by misunderstanding or without loss to both ; and to continue in a wider and more fertile field the encouragement of philological enthusiasm among the young . Tolkien was wrong about the ' growing neighbourliness ' , and about the ' more fertile field ' , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , he might not have needed to write The Lord of the Rings . Tolkien 's fiction is certainly rooted in philology as defined above . He said so himself as forcefully as he could and on every available opportunity , as for instance ( Letters , p. 219 ) in a 1955 letter to his American publishers , trying to correct impressions given by a previous letter excerpted in the New York Times : the remark about ' philology ' in the excerpted letter , ' I am a philologist , and all my work is philological ' was intended to allude to what is I think a primary ' fact ' about my work , that it is all of a piece , and fundamentally linguistic in inspiration ... The invention of languages is the foundation . The ' stories ' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse . To me a name comes first and the story follows . The emphasis in the passage quoted is Tolkien 's , and he could hardly have put what he said more strongly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bafflement or denial . And there is a respectable reason for this ( along with many less respectable ones ) , for Tolkien was the holder of several highly personal if not heretical views about language . He thought that people , and perhaps as a result of their confused linguistic history especially English people , could detect historical strata in language without knowing how they did it . They knew that names like Ugthorpe and Stainby were Northern without knowing they were Norse ; they knew Winchcombe and Cumrew must be in the West without recognizing that the word cwm is Welsh . They could feel linguistic style in words . Along with this , Tolkien believed that languages could be intrinsically attractive , or intrinsically repulsive . The Black Speech of Sauron and the orcs is repulsive . When Gandalf uses it in ' The Council of Elrond ' , ' All trembled , and the Elves stopped their ears ' ; Elrond rebukes Gandalf for using the language , not for what he says in it . By contrast Tolkien thought that Welsh , and Finnish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their phonetic and grammatical patterns , Sindarin and Quenya respectively . It is a sign of these convictions that again and again in The Lord of the Rings he has the characters speak in these languages without bothering to translate them . The point , or a point , is made by the sound alone - just as allusions to the old legends of previous ages say something without the legends necessarily being told . But Tolkien also thought - and this takes us back to the roots of his invention - that philology could take you back even beyond the ancient texts it studied . He believed that it was possible sometimes to feel one 's way back from words as they survived in later periods to concepts which had long since vanished , but which had surely existed , or else the word would not exist . This process was made much more plausible if it was done comparatively ( philology only became a science when it became comparative philology ) . The word ' dwarf ' exists in modern English , for instance , but it was originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can explain exactly how they came to differ , and how they relate to Old Norse dvergr . But if the three different languages have the same word , and if in all of them some fragments survive of belief in a similar race of creatures , is it not legitimate first to ' reconstruct ' the word from which all the later ones must derive - it would have been something like *dvairgs - and then the concept that had fitted it ? The asterisk before *dvairgs is the conventional way of indicating that a word has never been recorded , but must ( surely ) have existed , and there is of course enormous room for error in creating *-words , and *-things . Still , that is the way Tolkien 's mind worked , and many more detailed examples are given later on in this book . But the main point is this . However fanciful Tolkien s creation of Middle-earth was , he did not think that he was entirely making it up . He was ' reconstructing ' , he was harmonizing contradictions in his source-texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobbits ) , but he was also reaching back to an imaginative world which he believed had once really existed , at least in a collective imagination : and for this he had a very great deal of admittedly scattered evidence . Tolkien furthermore had distinguished predecessors in the previous century . In the 1830s Elias Lnnrot , the Finn , put together what is now the Finnish rational epic , the Kalevala , from scattered songs and lays performed for him by many traditional singers ; he ' reconstructed ' , in fact , the connected poem which he believed ( probably wrongly ) had once existed . At much the same time Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm , in Germany , took up their enormous project of compiling at once a German grammar , a German dictionary , a German mythology , a German cycle of heroic legends , and of course a corpus of German fairy-tales - literary and linguistic study pursued without distinction , just as it should be . In Denmark Nikolai Grundtvig had set himself to re-creating Danish national identity , with passionate attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballad-literature of later periods , eventually brought together by his son Sven . But in England there had been no such nineteenth-century project . When Tolkien then said , as he did ( see Letters , p. 144 ) , that he had once hoped ' to make a body of more or less connected legend ' which he could dedicate simply ' to England ; to my country ' , he was not saying something completely unprecedented ; though he did admit ruefully , in 1951 , that his hopes had shrunk . Ten years later he might have felt much closer to success . Tolkien , then , was a philologist before he was a mythologist , and a mythologist , at least in intention , before he ever became a writer of fantasy fiction . His beliefs about language and about mythology were sometimes original and sometimes extreme , but never irrational , and he was able to express them perfectly clearly . In the end he decided to express them not through abstract argument , but by demonstration , and the success of the demonstration has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point : especially in his brief , which I share , that a taste for philology , for the history of language in all its forms , names and place-names included , is much more widespread in the population at large than educators and arbiters of taste like to think . In his 1959 ' Valedictory Address to the University of Oxford ' ( reprinted in Essays , pp. 224-40 ) , Tolkien concluded that the problem lay not with the philologists nor with those they taught but with what he called ' misologists ' - haters of the word . There would be no harm in them if they simply concluded language study was not for them , out of dullness or ignorance . But what he felt , Tolkien said , was : grievance that certain professional persons should suppose their dullness and ignorance to be a human norm ; and anger when they have sought to impose the limitation of their minds upon younger minds , dissuading those with philological curiosity from their bent , encouraging those without this interest to believe that their lack marked them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this anger was , of course , failure and defeat . It is now very hard to pursue a course of philology of the kind Tolkien would have approved in any British or American university . The misologists won , in the academic world ; as did the realists , the modernists , the post-modernists , the despisers of fantasy . But they lost outside the academic world . It is not long since I heard the commissioning editor of a major publishing house say , ' Only fantasy is mass-market . Everything else is cult-fiction . ' ( Reflective pause . ) ' That includes mainstream . ' He was defending his own buying strategy , and doubtless exaggerating , but there is a good deal of hard evidence to support him . Tolkien cried out to be heard , and we have still to find out what he was saying . There should be no doubt , though , that he found listeners , and that they found whatever he was saying worth their while . The author of the century After this preamble , one may now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book 's title . Can Tolkien be said to be ' the author of the century ' ? Any such claim , ambitious as it is , could rest on three different bases . The first of them is simply democratic . That is what opinion polls , and sales figures , appear to show . The details are given immediately below , along with some consideration of how they should be interpreted , and how they have been ; but one can say without qualification that a large number of readers , both in Britain and internationally , have agreed with the claim , and that they have done this furthermore without prompting or direction . The second argument is generic . As the commissioning editor said , fantasy , especially heroic fantasy , is now a major commercial genre . It existed before Tolkien , as is again discussed below , and it is possible to say that it would have existed , and would have developed into the genre it has become , without the lead of The Lord of the Rings . This seems , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord of the Rings was quite clearly a sport , a mutation , lusus naturae , a one-item category on its own . One can only marvel , looking back , on the boldness and determination of Sir Stanley Unwin in publishing it at all - though significantly enough , he hedged his bet by entering into a profit-sharing agreement with Tolkien by which Tolkien got nothing till there were some profits to share , a matter clearly of some doubt at the time . Unwin had moreover continued to support and encourage his author over a seventeen-year gestation period which in the event delivered quite a different birth from what had been intended . It is true that he never had to pay over the large sums which James Joyce 's backers did , for instance , while Joyce was producing Ulysses , but then neither he nor Tolkien ever had the kind of support from a professional literary lite which Joyce and his benefactors could count on . However , while Ulysses has had few direct imitators , though many admirers , after The Lord of the Rings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . Any bookshop in the English-speaking world will now have a section devoted to fantasy , and very few of the words in the section will be entirely without the mark of Tolkien - sometimes branded deep in style and layout , sometimes showing itself in unconscious assumptions about the nature and personnel of the authors ' invented fantasy worlds . The imitations , or emulations , naturally vary very widely in quality , but they all give pleasure to someone . One of the things that Tolkien did was to open up a new continent of imaginative space for many millions of readers , and hundreds of writers - though he himself would have said ( see above ) that it was an old continent which he was merely rediscovering . An acceptably philological way of putting it might be to say that Tolkien was the Chrtien de Troyes of the twentieth century . Chrtien , in the twelfth century , did not invent the Arthurian romance , which must have existed in some form before his time , but he showed what could be done with it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eight centuries since . In the same way , Tolkien did not invent heroic fantasy , but he showed what could be done with it ; he established a genre whose durability we can not estimate .
