Storm wall , hold up the bright , Storm wall , dark as Rose night , Storm wall , where none can pass , Storm wall , always to last . -a child 's verse <p> Above the fortress the sky dimmed to lavender , a time that passed for night in this world . Here every creature knew by their internal clock what time of night or day it was , all but Johanna Quinn , a woman of Earth . Between this universe and the next only a thin wall intervened , a permanent storm that forbade contact between Earth and the Entire . Or so most believed . <p> Johanna hurried down deserted corridors following the heavy drumbeat of the engine just ahead , a bass thrumming that pounded in her ears and the hollow of her chest . Coming to a divide in the hall she took the left branch , remembering her partial and wholly inadequate map . This hall too was deserted , and she rushed on . She prayed not to be discovered , although she had her alibi , thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would kill her when the time came . There were good ways and bad , and she allowed herself-amid all her sacrifices-to have a strong preference in the matter . Her captors could do what they wished , of course . They were Tarig . <p> Tonight only one Tarig inhabited the Repel of Ahnenhoon , and Johanna profoundly hoped their paths would not cross . Her presence in this hall was not strictly forbidden , though . In her ten years of captivity she had earned a degree of freedom . Like a butterfly with a pin through its body , she could move up , down , and in a circle . Enough freedom to have learned by now how large , how vastly large , was her prison with its thousand miles of corridors and mazes . Even so , few sentients lived here-a measure of Tarig confidence regarding assault and their preference for solitary lives . However , they had not reckoned what havoc a lone woman could wreak . <p> Something yanked her from behind . She stifled a gasp , staggering . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knot of cables snaking along the wall . She tucked her hair into her tunic collar and hurried on , following the thunder of the engine , louder now as she approached its seat . <p> Up ahead was the opening she sought : the deck that circled the containment chamber . She passed through the arch and onto the catwalk where in time of siege defenders of the Repel might take aim against intruders . That Johanna was such an intruder her lord would be surprised to discover . <p> She gazed out on a broad valley of giant and baffling technology . Lights winked across acres of metal machines-many presumably computational devices-separated by paths as narrow as the Tarig who had made them . Alongside these machines tall struts held up silos of churning material , and these in turn sheltered docks of instrumentation , arcane in design and disorienting in their scale . An occasional gleam announced the work of molecular fabbers cleaning and repairing . Standing on the high deck Johanna could easily see the great engine nesting at the center of the cavern . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . The engine of Ahnenhoon . <p> From this distance it looked no larger than her fist . It crouched in two lobes like a metal heart . Within sight but not within reach . At floor level the engine nested in the center of an unbreachable maze . This was why she had come here tonight : to look for patterns . Somewhere in this cavern lay a path-a continuous course from the perimeter of the walls to the engine . Someday she would walk that path , to the heart of it . She gripped the rail and peered , searching for any route she could spy from this vantage point . Her eyes grew weary with the paths and their twists . She prayed for keen sight , being one who believed in prayer . But each lane that she traced through the valley of machines came to an end or fed back to the beginning . The maze held . <p> Nearby , perhaps three miles distant , the wall of the universe formed a barrier between this cosmos and Earth 's . The wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet this lobed engine could reach through , bringing about the collapse of all that she loved : the Earth and everything else beyond imagination to the ends of the folded , curving universe . It would not , Lord Inweer said , happen today or next year , but soon . In response to the siren call of the engine the Rose universe would fall in on itself in an instant . Thus collapsed it would burn so very brightly . A fine source of fuel and virtually an eternal one . <p> For all her intent gaze the maze kept its secret . No paths pierced the heart of the chamber ; at least not one she could see . This excursion was a failure . God , of course , did n't owe her a revelation . <p> She felt more than heard a presence behind her . Turning , she saw her servant . The vile creature had followed her . <p> " SuMing , " Johanna said , keeping her voice even . <p> SuMing bowed . As she did so her braid fell forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . <p> " Did you bring my shawl ? One is cold . " <p> " Your shawl is in your apartments of course . " <p> " Then you have a long walk back , SuMing . " <p> With a hint of a smile , SuMing bowed to her mistress . She had no choice but to fetch the shawl . As she turned away she stopped suddenly , then bowed again , deeply this time , as another figure appeared from a side corridor . <p> It was the Tarig lord . SuMing must have alerted him . Johanna bowed to Lord Inweer . " Bright Lord . " <p> In the early days his form had disquieted her , but no longer . Her lord 's face was fine , even beautiful . One could become accustomed to anything , living with it long enough , Johanna had learned . The Tarig even seemed normal with their muscular , attenuated bodies and seven-foot height . <p> Standing before Johanna now , Lord Inweer 's skin gleamed with a copper tinge as though he were cast from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt to billow . " Stay , " Lord Inweer said . The servant stopped and turned back , waiting on her lord 's pleasure . <p> However , Inweer took no further notice of SuMing , his eyes fixed on her mistress . <p> " Johanna , " he said , his voice smooth and deep . " We find you abroad . Not sleeping , hnn ? " <p> She had planned what to say if caught . With all the poise she could muster she turned from him , looking down into the chamber . " It called me . I had to see it . " <p> In four strides he stood next to her , his gaze sweeping the great hall one hundred feet below . <p> To Johanna 's dismay she found herself shaking . She breathed deeply to control this , but Inweer had already noticed . <p> " Afraid of heights , Johanna ? Or afraid of us ? " <p> " Both , " she answered , though only one was true . <p> On her back she felt the pressure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps he believed her . She had served him well , and received his indulgence in return . Until lately , since the news had come that Titus Quinn had been seen again in the great Tarig city far away . And that he had fled , taking all the Tarig brightships with him . Now Inweer had cause to worry where her loyalties lay . He suspected that she still loved her husband , and she let him believe that . It conveniently explained her agitation these days . But she hoped that Titus had forgotten her . He should concentrate on more urgent matters . Such as this engine . If he knew it existed . Pray God that he did know it existed : She had risked everything to ensure that he did . <p> Inweer guessed that her thoughts were of her husband . " Titus did not rescue you when he came to the bright city . Did you think it possible ? " <p> " No . Still ... " She put on a wry smile . " My husband was always unpredictable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Inweer had known Titus in the Ascendancy where the Tarig had kept him . All the ruling lords had known him . One had died of the experience . <p> Inweer watched her with an unblinking , black gaze . " You must shut your ears against the engine . " <p> " I ca n't . " <p> " Other things which we required of you were eventually possible . You recall ? " <p> Now he toyed with her . She dared to leave his question unanswered . Instead she murmured , " Why did you ever tell me , my lord ? " <p> In his chambers one ebb-time when he had held her as she wept , he had murmured the thing that he thought might release her from longing . He had told her the purpose of the engine . <p> " We should not have done it if it deprives you of rest . An error ? " <p> She put her hands on the railing , feeling the engine 's drumming even there . " Perhaps . " You made a mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , an error , " he conceded . " We wished for you to give up your hope of home . It had sickened you . We favor that you remain well . " He added unnecessarily , " You will never go home . " <p> " If not , I wish always to be with you , Bright Lord . " <p> " Yes , " he murmured . <p> If it appeared that he had forgotten SuMing he now made clear that he had not . " SuMing , " he said , " come to us . " <p> SuMing appeared by his side , bowing low . " Bright Lord ? " <p> Without looking at her but still gazing outward , he said , " Climb onto the railing . " <p> Her mouth quivered , then released the words , " Yes , Lord . " Wearing practical tunic pants , she climbed up , sliding her legs over the railing , locking her hands in position . She teetered ever so slightly . <p> Lord Inweer said , " Johanna , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very cold . " <p> " SuMing , " he said , " remove your jacket . " <p> To do so SuMing had to remove one hand from the rail to undo the clasps . After a long fumbling at knots she undid the five buttons , dipping one shoulder to let the jacket fall away , leaving her with a small shift for a top . <p> " Hand it to your mistress . " <p> She did so and Johanna took the garment , locking glances with the terrified girl . The silks of the girl 's tunic rustled in the air currents from below . <p> " Now jump , " Lord Inweer said . <p> Without hesitation , SuMing let go , pushed off , and plummeted . In an instant Inweer had grabbed her braid , stopping her fall and ripping a terrible shriek from her . Then she hung quietly , her braid clutched in Lord Inweer 's hand . <p> Inweer 's outstretched arm did not tire . He turned to Johanna . " Shall I open my hand ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . Johanna wished she were strong enough to rid herself of this enemy . But not this way . " No , my lord , " she whispered , " I will teach her to better please us . " <p> He cocked his head . " If so . " <p> She nodded . <p> Then Inweer raised his arm , lifting SuMing 's limp body in an effortless maneuver that hauled her onto the railing . With his other hand he pulled her knees clear and deposited her on the floor , where the girl collapsed , twitching . A trickle of blood fell down her neck . <p> Ignoring SuMing , Inweer resumed his conversation with Johanna . " It all has a price , " he said , gazing at the engine . " Even the gracious lords must pay a price for all we do . " <p> Johanna watched SuMing shivering on the floor , her scalp pulled halfway from her head . She could not go to her yet . <p> Inweer went on . " You understand the price ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can understand . " <p> In saying this he required her to leave him blameless in the matter of the engine . The Tarig universe was failing , its power source rapidly depleting . Only one decent substitute existed : Johanna 's universe . So the burning of the Rose was the price for the billion sentient lives gathered here in their far- flung sways and in their common hopes for life and love . The same things that people on Earth desired , which only one place could have . <p> SuMing inched away from the precipice and pulled herself into a ball , hugging her knees . <p> " SuMing , " Johanna said , " can you walk ? " <p> " Yes , mistress , " she whispered . <p> " Then go to bed . " Even traumatized and bleeding , SuMing should get out of Inweer 's sight quickly . <p> SuMing looked up . Her expression might as easily have been hatred as gratitude . She crawled backward for a small distance , eyes on Lord Inweer . Then she managed to stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move through her , the currents of things to come . The person sitting on the rail might easily have been herself . It helped to watch how others faced a terrible death . SuMing had been brave . <p> Inweer held out an arm for her . " Now you will rest ? " <p> She laid her hand on that hard skin , that tapering arm . <p> It would all be so simple if she despised this Tarig lord . But that was far from the case . <p> She looked into his dark eyes . " Yes , " she said , answering whatever he had asked her . She must always say yes . Loving him , it was easy to do . In most things she gladly obeyed , serving him in all ways but one . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
