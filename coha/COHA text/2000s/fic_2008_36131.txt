A polar bear did him in . The biggest damned polar bear anyone had ever seen in or around Prudhoe Bay in the last twenty-five years , or so it was reported . <p> Arrogance got him killed , though , and if William Emmett Harrington had n't been such a narcissist , he might still be alive . But he was a narcissist , and he was also a braggart . <p> The only topic of conversation William was interested in was William , and since he had n't accomplished much of anything significant in his twenty-eight years on earth , he was painfully boring . <p> William lived off his inheritance , a hefty trust fund set up by his grandfather , Henry Emmett Harrington , who must have had an inkling of the lazy-ass gene he was passing down , because his son , Morris Emmett Harrington , did n't work a day in his life . And William happily followed in his father 's footsteps . <p> Like all the Harrington men before him , William was a handsome devil and knew it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , but he could never lure any of them back for a repeat performance . No wonder . William treated sex like a race he had to win in order to prove that he was the best , and because he really was a narcissist , he did n't care about satisfying his partner . What he wanted was all that mattered . <p> His past conquests had come up with various nicknames for him . Pig was one . Quick Trip was another . But the one that was uttered most behind his back was The Minute Man . All the women who had gone to bed with him knew exactly what that meant . <p> Besides self-gratification , William 's other passion was running . He 'd made it a full-time job because , as with sex , he was shockingly fast . In the past year he had accumulated twenty-four first-place prizes within a six-state area , and he was about to enter a 5K race in his hometown of Chicago to collect his twenty-fifth . Since he believed crossing the finish line first was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read about , he called the Chicago Tribune and suggested they do a feature article about him in the Sunday paper . Harrington also mentioned more than once how photogenic he was and how a full-color photo of him would enhance the article . <p> One of the local news editors at the Tribune took the call and patiently listened to William 's pitch , then bounced him to one of the entertainment editors , who quickly bounced him to one of the sports columnists , who bounced him to one of the health and fitness editors , who wrote an entire article on the top-five allergens plaguing Chicago while he listened to the spiel . None of them was impressed or interested . The last editor to speak to William suggested that he give him a call back when he had ninety-nine wins under his belt and was going for one hundred . <p> William was n't discouraged . He immediately called the Chicago Sun Times and explained his idea for a story . He was rejected yet again . <p> William realized he was going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in print , and so he contacted the Illinois Chronicle , a small but popular neighborhood newspaper that focused primarily on local issues and entertainment . <p> The editor in chief , Herman Anthony Bitterman , was an antacid-popping seasoned veteran of the press with a pronounced Brooklyn accent . For thirty years he had been on the foreign desk of The New York Times and had garnered several prestigious honors including the RFK Journalism Award and the Polk Award , but when his good-for-nothing son-in-law ran off with another woman-his daughter 's yoga instructor , for the love of God-Herman retired from the Times and moved with his wife , Marissa , to Chicago where she had grown up and where their daughter now lived with her four little girls . <p> A newsman at heart , Herman could n't stay retired long . When the opportunity presented itself , he took the job at the Chronicle as a distraction from boredom and an escape from the horde of meddling in-laws . <p> He liked Chicago . He 'd gone to Northwestern University , where he 'd met Marissa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , so he could take a job at the Times . Coming back to Chicago after decades in New York was a real adjustment . He had lived in a cramped two-bedroom Manhattan apartment for so long that a two-story brownstone took some getting used to . His only real complaint was the lack of noise . He missed falling asleep to the soothing sounds of cars screeching , horns blaring , and sirens shrieking . <p> With so much quiet , even at the office , Herman found it difficult to get any work done . To compensate , he brought in an old television set from home , plopped it on top of his mini refrigerator , and left it on all day with the volume turned up . <p> When the call came in from William Harrington , Herman hit the mute button before picking up the phone . While he ate his lunch-an Italian sausage and green pepper sandwich drenched in ketchup and washed down with an icy cold Kelly 's Root Beer-he listened to Harrington pitch his story idea . <p> It took Bitterman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man was an egomaniac . <p> " Red , huh ? You always wear red socks and a red T-shirt for every race . And white shorts . Yeah , that 's interesting . Even when you run in the winter ? Still wear the shorts ? " <p> His question encouraged Harrington to ramble more , allowing Bitterman time to finish his sandwich . He took a long swig of his root beer , then interrupted Harrington 's grandiose opinion of himself and said , " Yeah , sure . We 'll do the story . Why not ? " <p> After scribbling down the particulars , Bitterman disconnected the call , then wadded up his brown lunch sack and tossed it into the trash can . <p> He crossed the office to get to the door-a no small feat considering nearly every inch of the room was filled with crates of Kelly 's Old-Fashioned Root Beer stacked halfway to the ceiling . Since his door was n't blocked , his office had n't been deemed a fire hazard , at least not yet . He was hoarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his estimation , it was the best damned root beer he had ever tasted , and when he 'd heard the company had been forced to close its doors and was going out of business , he had done what any root beer addict would do and rushed out to buy as many bottles of the stuff as he could get his hands on . <p> " Blond Girl ! " he shouted . " I 've got another story for you . This one 's a humdinger . " <p> Sophie Summerfield Rose tried to ignore Bitterman 's bellow as she put the finishing touches on an article she was about to e-mail him . <p> " Hey , Sophie , I think Bitterman 's calling you . " <p> Gary Warner , a brute of a man and the office snitch , leaned over her cubicle . His smile reminded Sophie of a cartoon fox with his teeth bared . He looked a bit like a fox , too . His nose was long and pointy , and his complexion was as dull as his long straggly hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gary loved his and used so much hair spray on it , it looked starched . <p> " Since you 're the only female here today and since you 're the only blonde in the entire office , I 'm pretty sure ' Blond Girl ' means you . " He had a good laugh over what he considered a hilarious observation . <p> Sophie did n't respond . No matter how obnoxious Gary became , and he had cornered the market on obnoxious a long time ago , she refused to let him rile her . She carefully pushed her chair back so she would n't hit the file cabinet again . It already had so many dents , it looked like someone had taken a baseball bat to it . <p> The Chronicle was housed in an old warehouse . It was a huge , gray stone building with gray cement floors , gray brick walls , and a dingy gray ceiling that Sophie suspected had once been white . The fluorescent lighting was nearly as old as the building . The presses were in the basement . Circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the editorial offices were on the second floor . It was a huge space , yet each gray-paneled cubicle , including hers , was the size of a refrigerator . A side-by-side , but still a refrigerator . <p> The Chronicle could have been a depressing place to work , but it was n't . Colorful posters hung above the gray file cabinets that lined the far wall , and each cubicle was brightly decorated . Some were more creative than others , but each gave a hint of the occupant 's personality . <p> Gary 's cubicle was decorated with half-eaten sandwiches and pastries , some at least a week old . He would n't let the cleaning crew touch his desk , and Sophie did n't think it had ever been cleared of the clutter . She would n't have been surprised to find roaches skittering under all the garbage , but Gary probably would n't have minded . He was most likely related to some of them . <p> Still hanging over her cubicle wall , his frame was so large she thought he might just snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too close , his rancid aftershave overwhelming . <p> So that he could n't snoop while she was in Bitterman 's office , Sophie turned her computer off and made sure he saw her do it . She was n't being paranoid . Just last week she had caught him sitting at her desk trying to get around her password to access her e-mail . He had already rifled through her desk . Two drawers were open , and he had n't bothered to put the stack of papers back where she had left them . When she demanded to know what he was doing at her desk , he stammered lamely about his computer being down and how he was checking to see if hers was down , too . <p> Bitterman roared again , and Sophie , feeling somewhat like a mouse navigating a maze , hurriedly zigzagged her way around the cubicles to reach his office at the end of the long room . She pictured a piece of yellow cheese dangling from a string in front of her boss 's door . Was n't that the reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> " Hey , Sophie , heard from your father lately ? " Gary shouted from behind . <p> He had asked her that same question about ten minutes after she had started working at the Chronicle , which was probably why she had taken such a quick dislike to him . Not only was Gary a snoop , but at times he could be downright antagonistic . Usually , people skirted around the subject of her dad , Bobby Rose , when they first met Sophie , but not Gary . She had just started writing her first ? article when Gary had called over the cubicle wall , " Hey , Sophie Rose ... oops , it 's Sophie Summerfield , is n't it ? I forgot , you 're not using your daddy 's name . Guess you do n't want the world to know who you are , huh ? I would n't either if my old man was a crook . Who 's he scammed lately ? Heard he 's made off with a butt-load of money . If you ever see him again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell him a couple of million would do just fine .... " <p> She had n't answered him then or the hundred or so other times he 'd asked about her father , and she was n't about to answer him now . <p> Gary was n't the only one interested in finding her father . She received regular visits from the FBI , the IRS , the CIA , and just about every other government agency with initials . All of them wanted to know where Bobby Rose was ; all of them wanted a pound of his flesh . <p> She heard Gary call out his question again , but she continued to ignore him as she rounded the last cubicle and reached Bitterman 's office . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
