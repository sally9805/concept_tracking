Chapter One Jade THE OLD MAN READ THE PASSAGE IN THE PROPHECY once more and nodded solemnly . " Soon , very soon , " he muttered . Rising with difficulty from his chair , he turned to face the Duke of Divulyon , who was waiting anxiously before him . " Well ? " asked the duke . The old man sighed deeply . He seemed exhausted . His face was etched with countless wrinkles . His back was bent , and he could barely stand on his trembling legs . Collapsing into an armchair , he said weakly , " I can not change a thing . She will follow her destiny . " " Theodon , you are a wise man , " said the duke , his voice rising in obvious distress . " You have devoted your entire life to understanding the Prophecy . You helped my father . You have helped me . You have advised me , supported me . Do not abandon me now ! She must live . She must triumph , whatever happens . She is so young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect her , Theodon ? " Holding his head in his hands , the old man remained silent for a long time . " I love her as much as you do , " he replied at last . " I watched her grow up , and even though it goes against my better judgment , I have become fond of her . But she will not escape the Prophecy . Believe me , if I could have helped her , I would have been the first to do so . You ask mehow she can be protected ? You can not protect her ! Try to understand that ! All you have to do is give her what is rightfully hers when the day comes . Now , go . Go and spend the few moments you have left with her . " " Fourteen years have passed much too quickly , " murmured the duke in weary resignation . Then he left the room . The old man stared at the flames blazing in the hearth . The Prophecy would he fulfilled . Now it was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had longed for it impatiently . Soon all his questions would be answered . He shivered . It was foolish of him to have become attached to the child ; he should n't have done that . The Prophecy had taken on another meaning : in those obscure pages where he had tried so hard to read the future and to understand the upheaval that was to come , he no longer saw anything except the fate of a girl named Jade . That same girl was lying sprawled across her bed . She was feeling much too restless to read the book in her hands , and there was a faraway look in her eyes . Roused from her reverie by a sudden knock at the door , she leaped to her feet , calling , " Come in ! " A servant opened the door a crack , and said , " Your father wishes to speak to you . Will you receive him now ? " Surprised that her father was not busy at that hour , Jade gave her consent , and the servant retired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over her shoulders . She looked in the mirror and approved of what she saw . True , her smile revealed teeth with slight gaps between them ; her eyelashes were perhaps a bit too thick ; and she was constantly brushing back a few rebellious stray locks . Whenever she became irritated ( which happened often ) , her cheeks grew red and she lost the self-conscious expression she usually wore . However , she knew she was tall , slender , and beautiful , and she always dressed with care . She was sure of herself . She knew that whatever she wanted , she could get . While she was smiling knowingly at her reflection , her father entered the room . She went to him , and he hugged her with unusual affection . Although he loved his daughter , he did not normally show his feelings so openly . Reserved by nature , he was always cool and composed . And yet , that day , something was making him behave differently . Releasing Jade from his embrace , he studied her for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her green eyes . She is brave and tenacious , he reflected , trying to reassure himself , and she has a strong character . Her features betrayed that character : you could see in her face that she was proud and determined , but capricious and stubborn as well . Lost in thought , her father could not stop gazing at her . It was Jade who broke the silence . " Papa , is something the matter ? Do n't you have any important business to attend to ? Why are n't you reading stacks of documents , or dealing with thousands of tasks as you do every other day ? Is something serious keeping you from your work ? Is it my fault ? " This last question was asked with feigned innocence , and her father answered with a forced smile . " No , no , Jade , nothing 's wrong . I 've just got a bit of free time , that 's all . I know it does n't happen very often , but , as you can see , it does happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long now till the party , " she replied eagerly . " It 's going to be absolutely fantastic ! I still ca n't decide between the mauve silk dress or the white satin one . I ordered a third dress , a splendid one , from the county of Tyrel . If it arrives in time , I shall wear that one . I simply ca n't wait ! Instead of counting the days , I count the hours-even the minutes ! I 've given instructions about how the banquet hall should be decorated , and what food and music we should have . Oh ! It 's such fun to be organizing everything myself ! And I 've arranged for musicians to come from a nearby town . " She kept on chattering enthusiastically , but her father was no longer listening . She 's too thoughtless , he admitted to himself reluctantly . She has never encountered difficulties ; she knows nothing of danger . She wo n't be able to survive . He reproached himself immediately for not having more confidence in Jade and tried to concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be magnificent , superb , spectacular ! I can hardly wait . I still have n't decided whether the ices should be served before the macaroons or afterward-perhaps after would be better , do n't you think ? By the way , I 'm not sure if the Baroness of Carolynt will be coming . It seems she has a fever . She 's the only guest who has n't accepted yet . Anyway , I find her boring- " " Jade ... Do you know what tear means ? " Startled into silence , Jade was annoyed . Why had her father interrupted her , especially to ask a question that was quite beside the point ? Was n't he looking forward to the party ? " Fear ? " she replied crossly . " Fear of what ? I 've never been afraid . It 's a hateful feeling . Only cowards and weaklings are frightened . Why do you ask me that , Papa ? " Just then , Jade realized how pale her father was . How could she have failed to notice how tired he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And above all , that haggard expression ... Something had happened . Perhaps his business affairs had not been going well .... " If only cowards and weaklings feel tear , then I am cowardly and weak , " said the duke . " In any case , it does n't matter . " " But , Papa ! You 're respected and admired by everyone , and for good reason ! You are the Duke of Divulyon ! " Jade 's face lit up again , her green eyes flashing . " I would believe you if you said you were worried about matters of state , but you , frightened ? No ! If this is a joke , it 's not very funny . " The duke did not reply . Jade 's spirits fell again . " And now , Papa , " she said gravely , " tell me why you do n't think my birthday is at all important . In a few days , I shall be fourteen years old ! " " You are quite mistaken , Jade . I am very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit his tongue . He had already said too much . She was not to know anything before it was time . Afraid that he might betray secrets he was not free to explain , he turned on his heel and left , going upstairs to his private suite , where he began to pace back and forth . Every second was bringing him closer to the moment when he would have to reveal everything . Puzzled , Jade wondered briefly about her father 's exceedingly strange behavior , then shrugged her shoulders and decided not to fret about it . Her thoughts returned to the festivities planned for her birthday , and a smile returned to her lips . Chapter Two Amber INSTEAD OF KEEPING AN EYE ON THE SHEEP IN her care , Amber was daydreaming , as usual . Sitting on the grass , she imagined herself living near the sun , enjoying its warmth , chatting to the clouds and birds . The wind carried her along on marvelous voyages ; at night , she was dazzled by the brilliance of stars she could reach out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to earth with a bump . She had forgotten that she was supposed to be looking after one of her little brothers as well as the flock of sheep . The child was sprawled under a tree , calling out to her at the top of his lungs . " Briette ! Come here ! I 'm bored .... Briette ! " Everyone had always called her Briette , even though her real name was Amber , which was probably too pretentious for a country girl and might have better suited a noble lady , someone from another world . She could n't imagine why her parents had chosen that name for her , although she 'd often wondered about it ; but she loved the name for its originality , its air of mystery . It seemed to conceal a secret . " Briette ! Briette ! Pretty-please , come here ! " Amber rose and went to rejoin her brother . She sat down beside him in the shade of the tree . " Whatever is the matter ? " she asked soothingly . " I 'm bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to tell me a story . " Smiling , Amber stroked his cheek affectionately . " Later , perhaps , but not right now . " " Why not ? " " I 'd like to be alone . I want to stay perfectly quiet and try to listen to the silence . " " I want a story ! You 're just saying silly stuff ! " The boy clung to her arm . " Please , Briette , " he begged . Tenderly ruffling his hair , she freed herself from his embrace , then kissed him on the cheek . " Later , I promise , " she said . " You stay here for the moment . I 'm going back into the sunshine-I do n't like to be in the shade . " " But , Briette , it 's so hot ! How can you stand being out in the sun ? " " I just like it , that 's all . " Amber returned to the middle of the meadow and sank down into the grass . Nobody wanted to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too blue , too pure . The sun bathed Amber 's face in light . Her hair was like red gold and gleamed like the sun , framing her lovely face with its tan complexion . Flecks of green flashed in her hazel eyes , giving them a natural sweetness and serenity . She loved to feel the sunshine caress her skin ; she enjoyed the heat that everyone else found so unbearable . People in the village hoped the dog days of summer would end soon , without bringing on a drought , but Amber wished the hot weather could go on forever . A silhouette appeared on the path and caught Amber 's eye : a boy was running toward her . He crossed the pasture and staggered to a stop near her , out of breath . She knew him well-he was her childhood friend-and she smiled at him , peaceful and untroubled . The boy could not return her smile , and looked sadly at her . Reluctantly , he gasped out his message . " Briette , hurry-I 'll stay with your brother and mind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's not doing well . " Amber thought her heart would stop . Everything collapsed around her . Mist floated before her eyes . Gripped by fear , she felt cold in the scorching sun . She could not move . " Briette ! Run ! Go ! You have n't much time-run , Briette ! " His voice reached Amber as if from far away . Her mind reeled as the whole world seemed to quake . With a desperate effort , she pulled herself together . She had to get there before it was too late . She scrambled to her feet and set out at a run . Fast . Fast . Tears blurred her vision , streaming down her face , but she never felt them . Only one thing still mattered-to prevent the unpreventable : her mother 's death . That must not happen ! Her mother was very ill and had been suffering greatly for months now . No medicine could save her . But she must n't die ! Amber ran her frantic race against time and death . She could already see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how tired she was . She reached the village square at last , and then her house , where she burst into the single room , so dark and silent , and rushed to her mother 's bedside . Kneeling , Amber took her mother 's hand , squeezing it with all her might , cradling it , feeling its warmth . Her mother lay moaning on the bed , a mere straw pallet . She was already deathly pale , and her face expressed unspeakable suffering . Her mind seemed to be wandering . " You 're here , Amber , you 're here , " she murmured weakly in a quavering voice . " I have only a few days left to live , " she went on after a moment , " and I will have fulfilled my mission . " " Mama , do n't talk anymore . It wears you out . " " No . Only a few days . But I wo n't make it . I 'm too sick . " Amber struggled to hold back her tears . As always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand even more tightly , she felt as though she were drowning in despair . " Mama , Mama , " she stammered helplessly , " everything will be all right . " She tried to believe her own words , wanted to convince herself they were true . More than anything , she would have liked all this to be only a nightmare and hoped she would awaken as usual , snuggled up with her sisters and brothers . But no , the nightmare went on and on , a horrible truth Amber did not want to face . She was used to conjuring up a dreamworld whenever the one in which she lived became too cruel . She would hide there , refusing to suffer . But her imagination was fragile , giving way easily to reality . Then the pain became even more intense , as if to take revenge on the girl who had tried to deny it . " Amber ... I must stay alive . A little while longer . A few days , only a few days . Soon I 'll be at rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice and realized that both their faces were wet with tears . Her mother groaned , almost resigned to her fate , but Amber was not yet ready to give up . She would fight on until the end , even when all hope was gone and there was no future left . True to her nature , she was still looking for a gleam of light in the darkness . " Amber . Amber . My mission , Amber ... " " Hush , Mama . Hush . Do n't talk anymore . It 's tiring for you , in your condition . But do n't worry , you 'll pull through . It 's nothing more serious than a cold . You 'll be up and about tomorrow . You 'll see , it 's a sunny day . The cherries are ripe . The grass is greener than ever . There is n't a single cloud . The sky is so blue ! It 's worth going outside for . Believe me , tomorrow you 'll be better . " Amber 's voice broke , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only want to live a few more days . After that , it does n't matter to me , but I have my mission , and it 's still too soon . If I die , who will do what must be done ? Amber , it 's my duty to stay alive for a few more days . But I wo n't be able to-I have n't got the strength . " " Mama , calm down . It 's important to rest . " " Amber , when my last day arrives , and it 's so close now ... promise you 'll believe me . Even if my words are those of a weak , sick woman ... promise me . " " I 'll promise you anything you want , Mama , but now , stop talking , it 's wearing you out . " Thinking her mother was delirious with fever , Amber did not take seriously anything she said . Chapter Three Opal " IF I WERE HER GUARDIAN , I 'D BE WORRIED about her . She 's so secretive , so fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't normal ! She has n't got a single friend , and no one can figure out what goes on inside her head . " " She never smiles , it 's unbelievable ! And her downcast eyes ... She has a way of being so cold and stubborn-it 's disturbing . " " Yes , there 's something very unusual and puzzling about her . It makes you uneasy . " The two gossips stopped chatting at the approach of one of the oldest women in the village . No one knew her age , not even she herself : she no longer had the strength or the desire to count the years . Nobody paid attention to what she said anymore ; people often thought she talked nonsense , but in spite of appearances , she was still lucid . Her back was bent , her face marked with a wrinkle for every path she had ever taken in life , and each of her slow steps seemed to cost her considerable effort . After a moment , she reached the two busybodies . She could not possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she drew near . They greeted her with hypocritical smiles . The old woman stared at them contemptuously . " Of course Opal is n't normal , " she said firmly . " Yes , she is different . And she will accomplish things you would never even dare imagine . " With that , she hobbled slowly away . Speechless , the two village women noticed for the first time how dignified and strong-willed Opal 's great-great-aunt was . ( Continues ... )
