Section : Health 5 ways to disease-proof your vital organs <p> LET 'S SAY YOU 'RE STRANDED ON A DESERT ISLAND . You know the game : You can have only 10 CDs . Or five books . Or one woman . For the rest of your life . Except , in this version , you can have only three organs . Which would you choose ? A heart , natch . How about a brain ? Definitely , otherwise the heart could n't pump a single pint . And nmero tres ? If you 're really honest , you 'd choose the organ you 'd need to satisfy the woman with whom you chose to spend eternity . <p> Of course , if you had just those three organs , eternity would last all of 2 seconds . And that 's the point of this gruesome hypothetical : We value certain vital organs more than others , but the fact is , they 're all just that  --  vital . So , while it 's great if you work hard to keep your heart healthy , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  it may be for naught if you are n't protecting your other anatomical all-stars , too . Do n't worry ; this guide will show you how to safeguard everything from your lungs to your liver . In other words , if your organs had to choose a single magazine article to be stranded with on a desert island , this would be their pick . LUNGS <p> If you think the airbags in your car are high tech , consider the set in your chest . Not only do they extract oxygen from the air you breathe and exchange it for carbon dioxide from your blood stream , but they also help filter out any bacteria and viruses you might have sucked in . The more efficiently your lungs function , the higher your energy levels and the lower your risk of an airborne infection . <p> Your best protection : A surfeit of flab is n't just hell on your heart . " Being overweight puts a tremendous strain on the lungs , " says John Mastronarde , M.D. , an associate professor at the Davis Heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excess fat in the chest wall can compromise lung expansion and possibly lung function . " Fortunately , even a relatively small drop in total poundage can have a big impact : A new study in the journal Chest shows that losing 10 percent of excess body weight can improve lung capacity by 5 percent . <p> As you cut back on high-calorie foods , increase your intake of the flavonoid-filled kind , particularly apples . " Flavonoids may have antioxidant properties that enhance lung function , " says Dr. Mastronarde . London researchers recently found that people who ate at least two apples a week had as much as a 32 percent lower risk of developing asthma . And an earlier study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute determined that eating an apple a day may cut the risk of lung cancer by 40 percent . KIDNEYS <p> Urban legends about organ theft invariably involve pilfered kidneys . And why not ? Only really valuable stuff gets stolen , and by anatomical standards , kidneys are practically priceless . They 're the twin treatment plants that remove excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood back into your circulatory system . But that is n't all . " They also regulate all the fluids , salts , and acids in the body , " says Leslie Spry , M.D. , a spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation . <p> Your best protection : Because kidney stones are more painful than a Real World reunion show , we tend to think of them as the biggest threat to our blood filters . But a greater danger , one that ca n't be prevented by consuming copious amounts of water , is high blood pressure . Chronically elevated BP can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys , causing them to slow down or stop their waste-removal function  --  and that can raise blood pressure even higher . Left untreated , this can become a veritable death spiral . <p> Besides the proven pressure-relief measures , such as ingesting less sodium and swallowing more potassium , there 's also a benefit to packing on more muscle . A recent study from the Medical College of Georgia shows that participants with the most muscle mass had 11 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those who were n't as buff . To achieve the maximum BP-lowering effect from your workouts , do power exercises ( see this month 's " 15-Minute Workout , " on page 66 ) ; they train the fast-twitch muscle fibers , which grow the largest . GALLBLADDER <p> Your gallbladder is basically a glorified holding tank . This pear-shaped organ is where a portion of the bile pumped out by your liver is stored until it 's needed to help digest fats in your small intestine . And while you can live without a gallbladder  --  your liver will send the necessary bile directly to your intestines  --  it 's worth keeping it healthy , if only to avoid the agony of a gallstone . <p> Your best protection : Gallstones , which are really more like " gallpebbles , " are small pieces of crystallized cholesterol . You can have a few and not even know they 're there  --  until one becomes painfully lodged in the duct leading to your small intestine . There is , however , a relatively simple way to prevent the little suckers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A Harvard University study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine monitored more than 45,000 men and found that one-third of all cases of gallstones could be prevented with 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise  --  from running to brisk walking  --  five times a week . Log that essential half hour of cardio work in the a.m. , then pile on the protection by eating oatmeal for breakfast and washing it down with orange juice . Research has determined that soluble fiber  --  of which oatmeal is one of the richest sources  --  and vitamin C can both lower the risk of gallstones . Note : In this case , skip the fresh-squeezed OJ and buy the frozen-concentrate kind instead ; lab analyses show that frozen actually has the highest levels of vitamin C. PANCREAS <p> A Leatherman has nothing on this multi-tool . Located between your stomach and your spine , your pancreas secretes insulin to regulate blood-sugar levels and metabolic rate , as well as to help neutralize stomach acids that accidentally enter the intestines . " It also produces enzymes that break down the fats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " says John Affronti , M.D. , an associate professor of medicine at the Emory University school of medicine . <p> Your best protection : If you 're guarding against gallstones , then you 've already reduced your risk of pancreatitis , an inflammatory condition often caused when an errant stone blocks the organ 's main duct . And , as a sort of bonus , by preventing pancreatitis , you also help lower your odds of being diagnosed with a disease that 's deadly in nearly 100 percent of cases : pancreatic cancer . ( It 's as fast as it is fatal ; pancreatic cancer killed Little Joe , a.k.a . Michael Landon , in just 3 months . ) <p> Another strategy for slashing your cancer risk is to pig out on produce . When Canadian researchers analyzed the diets of nearly 5,000 men , they discovered that those who adhered to a diet high in fresh fruits and cruciferous vegetables had a 49 percent lower risk of pancreatic cancer than men who ate mainly meat and potatoes . If you 're not a fan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em with ketchup . In a study published in the Journal of Nutrition , men who regularly consumed tomato-based products lowered their odds of developing pancreatic cancer by 31 percent . All the kudos go to lycopene , the red pigment that first earned its stripes in the battle against prostate cancer . LIVER <p> More than just your body 's antidote to alcohol , your liver helps flush out other toxic stuff you were never meant to swallow , e.g. , any food purchased from a drive-thru window . The organ does this by producing a grease-dissolving goo known as bile . ( See " Gallbladder . " ) Oh , and in its spare time , your liver also removes bacteria from your bloodstream , lays away a supply of iron , and converts glucose into glycogen to be stored for energy . <p> Your best protection : You know the spiel  --  cut back on the booze and your liver will live longer . That means two drinks a day , max , if you want to avoid cirrhosis , a disease in which normal liver cells become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much scar tissue forms that the liver no longer functions properly and its main vein becomes blocked . That said , do n't wave off the bartender just yet ; pretend you need to sober up and order a cup of coffee . <p> A new study of more than 90,000 Japanese published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reveals that those who drank 1 to 2 cups of joe daily had half the risk of liver cancer of those who went without . ( Score one for Starbucks ; there are more than 500 of the stores in Japan . ) The study also shows similarly dramatic results for people with liver diseases , such as hepatitis . " Coffee contains large amounts of antioxidants , " says Manami Inoue , M.D. , Ph.D. , the study author . " And studies have shown that such coffee compounds inhibit carcinogens in the liver . " The best bean ? British researchers discovered that medium-roasted coffee has higher antioxidant activity than dark-roasted varieties . Your Spleen , ' Splained <p> An inside look at that most mysterious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you probably have no idea why your spleen is taking up space in your abdominal cavity . The explanation is actually simple : It 's there to help your body fight infection . Specifically , your spleen sends out white blood cells called lymphocytes that can weaken or kill bacteria and viruses . At the same time , it also helps your kidneys filter blood . Both of these jobs sound kind of critical , do n't they ? Well , they are n't . <p> " The spleen is n't so important , " says Andy Saxon , M.D. , chief of clinical immunology and allergy at the UCLA medical center . " It generates some antibody responses and clears certain types of bacteria , but you can live well without it . " And in fact , many people do . In cases of injury or cancer of the spleen , doctors often remove the organ . At first there 's a slightly increased risk of infection , but the liver and lymph nodes quickly pick up the slack . So , like the appendix , the spleen may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved , it became obsolete . Still , scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital may have one good use for it : growing new organs . The researchers recently discovered evidence that the spleen may contain a secret stash of adult stem cells .  --  T.S . <p> <p> By Ted Spiker <p>
