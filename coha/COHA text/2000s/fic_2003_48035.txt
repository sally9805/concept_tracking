ONCE THERE WAS A CAPTAIN of industry who lost his shoes . They were fine brown shoes , with red leather tassels . The captain of industry , whose name was George , sat in a board meeting in his socks . Everyone was upset about the stock market crash and they all had opinions , but George could not pay any attention to them at all because he was so worried about his shoes . So he said , " Excuse me , " and got up from his soft leather chair , and even though he was the most important of them all , they were arguing so hard that no one noticed when he left the room . <p> He went onto the roof because he thought his shoes might be there , and because he had a thing about roofs . He walked carefully over the gravel , among the ventilator fans , which looked like giant steel mushrooms with spinning heads . He also stopped to pick up the gravel with his toes , which he could do in his socks because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel off the roof into the parking lot with his toes . <p> Then a flock of pigeons came and took ahold of his suit in their beaks and lifted him into the air . <p> At first George fought with the birds and tried to kick them , but that did no good . <p> Soon they were high over Lake Geneva . <p> Looking down , George saw a beautiful woman with no shirt on sunning herself on the deck of a sailboat . He fell in love . He fell in love with her saucy French lips ; with her air of wise amusement ; with her breasts like extra-large scoops of insouciant almond ice cream melting in the breeze . He called to her , but she was too far below . So he took out his cell phone and dropped it into the crow 's nest of the sailboat . His aim was good ; he was a talented man . <p> Then he sang to the birds , mainly Cole Porter songs , because falling in love put him in a nostalgic mood . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Too Darn Hot . " He sang " I Get a Kick Out of You . " He also sang " The Logical Song " by Supertramp . <p> The birds liked it . <p> In the crow 's nest of the sailboat , the cell phone rang . The woman , whose name was Francesca , climbed up into the crow 's nest to answer it . It was George 's wife . <p> " Honey , " said George 's wife in a rush , " you forgot your shoes this morning . " <p> " I am not Honey , " said Francesca , " I am Francesca . " <p> " Oh ! " said George 's wife , and turned red . She dropped the shoes onto the Navajo rug . There was a woodpecker hammering outside her window . <p> The woodpecker was a thousand years old . He had stayed alive all this time because , when he was young , he had built his nest in the hair of a famous Hindu ascetic who was standing very still . The ascetic had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conserve his semen , and how to chew his food very carefully , so that he would not age . The woodpecker had built up a great deal of wisdom and spiritual merit in his thousand years . However , the woodpecker was now sick of this crap . He just wanted to get laid . <p> When the woodpecker saw George 's wife looking distraught , staring at the phone in her hand and then staring at the shoes with the red leather tassels on the Navajo rug , he became aroused , because he liked distraught women . <p> He flew in through the window and convinced George 's wife to make love to him . She felt depressed and listless and not at all like having sex . However , she felt very angry at George for leaving his cell phone with a woman named Francesca ; and she loved cartoons . So sex with a woodpecker might be just the thing . <p> She took off her house dress , as the woodpecker instructed , and , naked except for her white bunny slippers , leaned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woodpecker mounted George 's wife and began to copulate with her . <p> Oh ! - thought the woodpecker - to at last be making love ! Pfui on the silence that allows the discursive ego to fall away ! Pfui on the enlightenment that dissolves the illusory distinction between the self and the universal background of bliss ! Let me at your cloaca , baby ! Yes ! Uh ! Uh ! <p> George 's wife felt a pleasant , feathery tickling . <p> The woodpecker felt a great heat , a great trembling , building - and then it rushed through him in a wave and , without meaning to , he slammed his beak three times against the woman 's tailbone <p> BANG BANG BANG <p> " Ouch ! " cried George 's wife . " Stop it ! Do n't do that again ! " <p> " Sorry , sorry , " said the woodpecker , continuing to copulate with her . The trembling came again . He crossed his eyes . He held his breath . He felt the wave shooting through him and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , his beak came down in the small of the woman 's back <p> BANG BANG BANG <p> " OUCH ! " cried George 's wife , and she smacked the woodpecker off her back with one hand , so that he flew onto the kitchen table , knocking over the milk and getting quince jelly in his feathers ( she had been a little depressed before the phone call anyway and had not yet cleared the breakfast dishes ) . <p> " Just who do you think you are ? " yelled George 's wife . She rubbed her back and licked the blood off her fingers . She felt angry and powerful , and she imagined that she could smack Francesca off the polar bear rug on which she was undoubtedly sitting , wearing a teddy and garters and things , so that Francesca would tumble out the window of her penthouse apartment and into the street below . <p> " I 'm terribly sorry , " said the woodpecker , and he shook his feathers , spraying jelly on the Navajo rug . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked her in the eye . " Ma'am , " he said , " I am a woodpecker . " <p> They watched a rivulet of spilled milk run along the baseboard of the dining room until it reached the cedar bookshelf . <p> " If you like , I 'll go , " the woodpecker said . <p> Without a word , George 's wife went to her son 's room ( the son was at boarding school ) and returned with a miniature foam rubber football . With the bread knife , she made an incision in the football , and then she stuck it on the woodpecker 's beak . Then she returned to her position at the couch . <p> The woodpecker wondered : what would be appropriate at this juncture ? The foam rubber football on his beak made him feel ridiculous , despite all of his spiritual merit . By tilting his head , he could see past the large blob of out-of-focus blue , to the woman 's vast , attractive buttocks like two large summer moons against a fuzzy taupe sky . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the woman and began to copulate with her again . <p> The woman was starting to enjoy the sex . It felt like the fluttering of a feather duster against her bottom , an insistent , passionate feather duster . Sometimes she could feel a hard little nobbin that might be the tiny penis of the woodpecker . Compared to her woodpecker lover she felt gigantic , powerful , an Amazon Queen . <p> I will control myself this time , the woodpecker thought . I will not humiliate myself again by rapping this lovely creature as if she were a tree full of worms ! A large white tree , like a birch , with incredibly smooth , silken bark , and luscious plump worms burrowing beneath its surface , a goddess tree with holy worms , singing , singing , calling - the woodpecker launched himself into the air , flapped once , and landed against the woman 's neck , slamming his beak against her <p> FOP FOP FOP <p> The woman giggled . <p> The woodpecker slid back down and ejaculated into the hole his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine . <p> The thousand years he owed entropy pounced on him in that moment , and he turned to dust . <p> The spiritual merit of the woodpecker surged up the woman 's spine . Her skin glowed red . She could hear nothing but her own breathing , which was a roar like a freight train passing - a roar like the ocean - a roar like a trillion lions , if every atom of the Earth became a lion , a huge globe of lions roaring and clawing at each other in the depths of space . <p> The miniature foam rubber football , now dusty , rolled from her back onto the Navajo rug . <p> The woman stood up . She kicked off her bunny slippers . Now she was naked . <p> She slipped her feet into George 's shoes , the ones with the red leather tassels . <p> She went into the backyard . <p> She took a deep breath full of her years with George : fabric softener , diapers , midnight snacks before the cold fridge , stupid show tunes floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's small arms when he was three . <p> She bent her legs . Her knees no longer creaked . <p> She jumped into the wide suburban sky . <p> Author Affiliation
