3:45 p.m . The Browns have reassembled . Adam , eight , and his sister Meaghan , 13 , are home from school , grabbing a snack and deflecting mom 's questions about homework . Chris is standing quietly in the kitchen , winding down after his commute from the GM plant in Oshawa , Ontario ( the Browns live in Port Hope ) . He 's waiting for the re-entry turbulence to subside so he can catch up with his wife , Erin , something they tend to do at this time each day . And Erin Brown is in gear . She 's exhorting her children to look at their homework as she collects lunch stuff and pulls together an evening meal that she will not eat . Erin has a 5:30 meeting at the school . " This is it right here . Family time , " she says , laughing . " Some days , it 's the only time we 're all in the house together . But it 's also my busy time because I 'm usually setting things up so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about the time crunch for parents , the cliche is the urban two-income family where lawyer mom and stockbroker dad endure hour-long commutes on clogged expressways and juggle early morning meetings with dentist appointments and daycare pickups . Erin Brown is a stay-at-home parent . But since she 's deeply involved with school council , she tends to be home when her family is at school or board committee dealing with the closure of Meaghan 's senior public school , " she says . " Tonight I 've got regional school council . Tomorrow , school council . Thursday it 's the back-to-school barbecue . " On non-meeting nights Brown sometimes does errands , because that 's when she can get the one family car . Not every week is like this one and , since her kids have grown more independent , they are less likely to want to do things with Brown when she 's home . Meaghan likes to curl up on the couch with mom and watch TV sometimes , and Adam likes her to , well , fix snacks and help him find things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . You 're never home ! ' " she laughs . " But sometimes I can be home all evening and he 's off doing his own thing . He does n't even know I 'm here . " Ask a parent  --  most adults , at that  --  how things are and they 'll often say , " Busy . " That 's not just an automatic answer , says sociologist Kerry Daly of the University of Guelph , who has interviewed many parents on this subject . " We have good evidence that families are feeling more of a time crunch than they were even ten years ago . " A big part of it is that we are working more . Remember in the 1970s when there were predictions of a leisure society ? Fat chance . Paid work done by Canadian parents has increased steadily since the 1980s ; between 1992 and 1998 it went up two hours per week , to 48.6 for men and 38.8 for women . There may be several reasons for this  --  downsizing in workplaces , people struggling to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of it down to pure consumerism . " I think sometimes we just keep working more because we keep shopping more and have bigger houses to put our stuff in , " he says . Here are some other facts gleaned from the General Social Survey , a massive pile of data collected by Statistics Canada : Canadians devote the greatest proportion of their time to both paid and unpaid work when they are in their prime child-bearing years ( ages 25 to 44 ) . In spite of this , the amount of time families spend with their children has changed little . What tends to be sacrificed is personal leisure and housework . Compared to 1992 , Canadians aged 15 and over reported higher levels of time stress in 1998 , and more Canadians reported having not enough time for family and friends . Married , employed parents and employed single mothers between the ages of 25 and 44 report the highest levels of time stress . None of this comes as a shock . And as we 've seen , it 's not simply a phenomenon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all shapes and sizes . Angie Smith lives in the quiet town of Russell , Manitoba , where you might expect to see lots of stay-at-home moms , kids riding their bikes up and down the street and everybody sitting down to dinner in nice , big country kitchens . The only time Smith 's family of four sits down together for dinner is on weekends . In fact , four nights a week , neither mom nor dad is at home at dinnertime . Smith works as a receptionist until 7 p.m. , four days a week . Her husband has his own cleaning business and works from 4:30 to 10:30 on weeknights , and then several hours most Saturdays . Most weeknights Ashley , six , and Bronson , three , eat dinner with their grandparents . " Family dinnertime is definitely one place where I 'm feeling cheated right now , " Angie says . " Ideally I 'd want us all together discussing how our day went , like other families . " ( Of course , some parents who are home for dinner probably wish for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downs of their day . ) To some extent , time stress and parenting would seem to be inevitable bedfellows . After all , child rearing is labour-intensive and often coincides with the career-building phase of people 's lives . E-mail , cell phones , laptops and palm organizers have made it easier to bring work home . Then when we are home  --  really home , as in emotionally available to our children  --  we must reconcile their needs and demands with our own leisure activities and domestic tasks . Parenting has always been a lot of work , but today there is more of a perceived need  --  and expectation  --  for parents to actively manage their children 's lives , as opposed to simply feeding and clothing the kids and then sending them out to play . " Parents now are expected to invest time in their children 's development , " says Daly , " to play with them , be involved in their schooling , to explore child-care options and monitor their quality . " Our time is increasingly tied to the needs and demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housework , but we spend more time talking to teachers , arranging playdates , lessons and sports and driving our children to this or that activity . We did n't really expect that our lives would get simpler when we had kids . The question is , what do we do about it ? The temptation might be to try and become better time managers . But , although multi-tasking and time-management skills are helpful , they alone are not the answer , Daly suggests . " In many ways , time management is a game parents ca n't win . It 's built on the business model of efficiency  --  do more in less time  --  but people are already doing too much . What we really need is a different way of thinking about time . " Nora Spinks of Toronto agrees . She 's a consultant on family and work issues and has run workshops where she helps parents look at their decisions about time . " We 're running so fast we do n't have time to stop and consider why we do the things we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing , " she observes . " Start by asking yourself why you do what you do . Then ask yourself if your answer makes sense . " Spinks once spoke with a mother who , in her quest for good motherhood , vacuumed every day . Why ? Because her mother did . In the end it emerged that her mother lived on a farm and had five kids who were all home messing up the house every day from 3:30 onward . " This woman had two kids and nobody got home until 6 p.m. , " Spinks notes . " She did n't need to vacuum every day . " Trying to cram so many things into a day can spill over into our leisure time . " If you rush all week , it 's not easy to slow down on weekends , " Spinks says . Family time is then in danger of being yet another thing to cross off the todo list . Spinks recalls observing this phenomenon once when she took her daughter to a sugar bush . " Some parents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she recalls . " Maybe some of those kids would have liked to play in the puddles a little bit . That 's what my daughter had fun doing . " " Time decisions are values decisions , " Daly notes . " Any decisions made about the allocation of time , whether it be to work in the garden or to go into the office on the weekend , involve assigning value to the activity , whether we do it consciously or not . " For example , most middle-class families accept that lessons and activities are good for children . However , those activities compete with family time . Sometimes , particularly when our kids are young , Spinks wonders whether , in the rush to give kids all these skills , some families lose out on togetherness . " So you go to swimming lessons and the child is in the pool waiting for his turn with the teacher and the parents sit off to the side , " says Spinks . " I 'm not knocking swimming lessons , but is that always the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , once a week , for the same ten-week period as a set of lessons , go to a family swim where you 're all in the pool having fun together , and your child is still getting used to the water ? " Before we think about reordering our priorities , we should perhaps reflect on what we mean by family time . There 's a tendency to assume that it must be unhurried , non-task-oriented activities that involve everybody . If that 's all it is , families with very young children are in trouble . Parenting young children is very hands-on , but it 's not always a case of " doing things together . " Geoff and Lisa Inder of Chamberlains , Newfoundland both work outside the home . They 're both home most evenings and weekends , so they actually have a fair bit of time together . However , much of it is spent in the labour-intensive mode that is normal for parents of very young children ( James is three and Jacob is five months ) . Family time for them often means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jacob will put up with me for a while , " Geoff quips , " but before long he wants to go back to Lisa . " For her part , Lisa , wishes for more time with James . " Obviously , I see less of him , now that I have someone else who needs me all the time . I 'm hoping to find an activity that James and I can do together Saturdays , to give us some regular time for just the two of us . " We might also tend to assume that family time means not only everyone being together , but also feeling good about it . " I found that people were reluctant to call it family time unless there 's a quality of specialness about it , " says Daly . " It was that kind of special time that people want most , yet find most elusive . " Daly 's theory is that family time is an idea that we carry around in our heads , one based on a mythical ideal . " I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but we do know that we value it greatly and that we want it to be good . " Spinks agrees : " Some people have this image of family time being Leave It to Beaver dinnertime . But that 's not real family time . Real family time is shared periods of laughter , joy or sorrow . When you ask people about their best memories , they 're less likely to remember the details about going to the sugar bush , but they remember how much fun they had with dad . " Perhaps what we really yearn for is not time , but connection . It 's about belonging , about feeling close to our loved ones . That 's another reason why time management is not the whole answer . You can schedule a family hike or a trip to the fair , but you ca n't schedule how it will feel . " When we try to orchestrate family time , it does n't always meet our expectations , " says Daly . " So often the special moments are those that happen serendipitously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mundane , often unfulfilling everyday tasks , punctuated with wonderful little pings of connectedness . And those pings can come just about anytime , anywhere  --  on Christmas morning or on vacation , but also during a diaper change , in the car on the way to daycare , during a phone call or in the wake of the latest hassle . " Sometimes it comes right out of the blue , " says Erin Brown . " You ca n't say to your children , " OK we 're going to have some quality family time now . ' Sometimes you have to stop what you 're doing and say , " Dinner can wait 15 minutes , because this is an opportunity to connect with my kid . ' I know , I do n't always do that because I 'm just too busy and that 's when I kick myself later . To get the good times , you just have to be there and ready to grab them when they come your way . " " Time management is a game parents ca n't win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're already doing too much . " When we orchestrate family time , it does n't always meet our expectations . Often the special moments happen serendipitously . <p>
