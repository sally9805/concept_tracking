Giovanni Schiaparelli could have told you there had been water on Mars . It was Schiaparelli who peered through his telescope one evening in 1877 and discovered what he took to be the Red Planet 's famous canals . As it turned out , the canals were an optical illusion , but as more powerful telescopes and , later , spacecraft zoomed in for closer looks , there was no shortage of clues suggesting that Mars was once awash in water . Photographs shot from orbit show vast plains that resemble ancient sea floors , steep gorges that would dwarf the Grand Canyon and sinuous surface scars that look an awful lot like dry riverbeds . <P> Given all that , why were NASA scientists so excited last week to announce that one of their Mars rovers , having crawled across the planet for five weeks , finally determined that Mars , at some point in its deep past , was indeed " drenched "  --  to use NASA 's term  --  with liquid water ? <P> Part of their excitement probably stems from sheer failure fatigue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  including a few disastrous missions to Mars . So it was with some relief that lead investigator Steve Squyres announced that the rover Opportunity had accomplished its primary mission . " The puzzle pieces have been falling into place , " he told a crowded press conference , " and the last piece fell into place a few days ago . " <P> But there was also , for the NASA team , the pleasure that comes from making a genuine contribution to space science . For despite all the signs pointing to Mars ' watery past , until Opportunity poked its instruments into the Martian rocks , nobody was really sure how real that water was . At least some of the surface formations that look water carved could have been formed by volcanism and wind . Just two years ago , University of Colorado researchers published a persuasive paper suggesting that any water on Mars was carried in by crashing comets and then quickly evaporated . <P> The experiments that put that theory to rest  --  and nailed down the presence of water for good  --  were largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Meridiani Planum that mission scientists dubbed El Capitan . The surface of the formation is made up of fine layers  --  called parallel laminations  --  that are often laid down by minerals settling out of water . The rock is also randomly pitted with cavities called vugs that are created when salt crystals form in briny water and then fall out or dissolve away . <P> Chemical analyses of El Capitan , performed with two different spectrometers , support the visual evidence . They show that it is rich in sulfates known to form in the presence of water as well as a mineral called jarosite , which not only forms in water but also actually contains a bit of water trapped in its matrix . <P> The most intriguing evidence comes in the form of the BB-size spherules  --  or " blueberries , " as NASA calls them  --  scattered throughout the rock . Spheres like these can be formed either by volcanism or by minerals accreting under water , but the way the blueberries are mixed randomly through the rock  --  not layered on top , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests the latter .
