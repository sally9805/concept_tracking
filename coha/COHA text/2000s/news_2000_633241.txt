<p> Bathing in a 300-gallon copper cheese vat was just the first wave of a strangely romantic getaway to the Don Q Inn , a southwest Wisconsin fantasy motel with a 1970s disco feel . <p> The vat was perched on a ceramic basin , creating a bird bath effect . You could be all you want to be . I was a golden-winged warbler . A wren-thrush . A horned lark ! Enough . <p> We  --  ( and I stress we , I would never do this alone ) were in Don 's Den , a basement " suite " with golden brown shag carpeting on the floor  --  as well as above the bathroom mirror and below the sink . My lust was illuminated by a fake fireplace and mirrors above the bed . <p> My girlfriend was reviewing escape routes . <p> The weird weekend also included the sleepy acoustic music of " The Bob and Rod Show " in the Don Q Supper Club , car trouble that took us to downtown Dodgeville and a rescue from a car salesman named Dean Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquartered in Dodgeville ( pop . 4,200 ) , about 45 miles south of Madison . We felt like we were at the end of the world . <p> The Don Q Inn was built by the late Don C. Quinn ( get it ? ) , a former World War II fighter pilot . After the war , Quinn was a pilot for United Airlines before becoming corporate pilot for John Christopher Doyle , the multimillionaire owner of Javelin LTD , a Canadian mining company . <p> Quinn died of cancer in the summer of 1988 . He was 64 . He bought the 280-acre plot of Don Q land on Highway 23 just north of downtown Dodgeville in the mid-1960s . In 1968 he opened a classic Wisconsin supper club in a barn that had been built in 1914 . The supper club 's beams are from the old Douglas Aircraft plant , which stood where O'Hare Field is today . <p> Quinn moved his family into a home in the dandy Don Q compound , but that was n't enough . He also installed a 3,000-foot gravel runway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C-97 is on display on the runway . It was once  --  back in the 1940s  --  the largest plane in existence . Why a Boeing C-97 ? It was used in Lincoln-Mercury television commercials which featured Farrah Fawcett-Majors . Her autograph appears on the side of the plane , which is appropriate . <p> This place spells Farrah . <p> Work on the 45-room Don Q Inn began around 1972 and the motel opened in 1974 . Quinn 's idea was to replicate the supper club as much as possible , using heavy timbers to create a barn-like feel . Quinn was a resourceful guy . <p> The supper club 's " Pump Room " once featured a shag carpet that covered the pre-stress concrete ceiling . The carpet had to be suspended by shooting nails through the carpet and into the concrete with a nail gun . <p> " Each nail required a washer to keep the nail head from pulling through the carpet , " said Ron Dentinger , Quinn 's best friend , who was the hotel 's entertainment director and general manager between 1974 and 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he decided not to use washers . Don shot the nails through pennies . The pennies worked as good as the washers , and Don saved a quarter of a cent with every shot . " <p> The motel 's rooms include lamps made from old fire extinguishers , and classic Singer foot treadle-type sewing machines have been transformed into television stands . The Swiss cheese vats/bathtubs were imported from cheese factories throughout southwest Wisconsin . All these features are part of the motel . Once you begin to understand Don Q , you understand the inn . <p> And Quinn loved his ceiling mirrors . Dentinger  --  whose 59th birthday is on Valentine 's Day  --  said , " He often joked , ' It looks like a naked skydiver is coming right at you . ' " <p> But these days the Don Q Inn looks as if it has seen better days . The motel is owned and operated by Royal Hospitality in Burnsville , Minn. , a suburb of Minneapolis . " Don 's Den " was dank and dusty , although the mirrors worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nine " Theme Suites " that also include " The Float " ( a queen waterbed set in a Viking ship surrounded by mirrored walls ) and " Shotgun " ( a queen-sized bed complemented by a deer hunting theme , vintage shotguns on the wall and a 300-gallon copper cheese vat tub ) . Theme Suites are $ 85 a night , $ 95 on Fridays and $ 110 on Saturday nights . <p> The Don Q cleaning ladies allowed us to take a peek into the " Tranquility Base " two-story suite down the hall from " Don 's Den . " Guests sleep in a re-creation of a Gemini Space Capsule propped up by iron stilts . A moon crater hot tub sits underneath the space capsule , which is filled by a waterfall flowing from " moon rocks . " The room includes AM/FM stereo and a Super Nintendo video game . And just in case you get really lonely , the room features a life-sized mannequin dressed as an astronaut . The " Tranquility Base " ranges from $ 164 to $ 224 ( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FantaSuite " Suites ( which range from $ 139 to $ 199 ) include " Cupid 's Corner , " a Valentine 's Day dream anchored with a heart-shaped bed with mirrored ceiling and black marble whirlpool , as well as the " Jungle Safari , " done as a thatched jungle hut with a whirlpool . <p> If Elvis is indeed alive and well , he 's at the Don Q Inn . <p> We checked into Don 's Den and checked out the room service menu . You ca n't order breakfast in bed , but there 's a full-tilt wine-service menu , which includes California Corbett Canyon Chardonnay ( $ 12.50 a bottle ) and the deep berry-flavored product of the Wollersheim Winery in Sauk City , Wis. ( $ 16.50 a bottle ) . Although wine and cheese vat sounded tempting , we passed in favor of a visit to the supper club lounge . <p> Even that was weird . <p> We walked through a dimly lit 325-foot winding tunnel that connected the motel to the supper club . Quinn purposely constructed the tunnel with twists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He installed old miners ' picks and animal bones in the ceiling . Quinn even did his own blasting for the tunnel , putting ripples in lakes more than 50 miles away . <p> Once we emerged from the tunnel , we made our way into the lounge . Middle-aged folk singers Bob and Rod were singing ballads to a half dozen regulars who looked like miners at the end of a long workday . Bob and Rod sang covers like Jimmy Buffett 's " Changes in Latitudes " and Van Morrison 's " Brown Eyed Girl " with all the force of a down pillow . <p> Bob 's smoky , laid-back vocals reminded me of the late Charlie Rich . I shouted across the quiet bar to ask Bob and Rod if they knew any Charlie Rich songs . His mid-1970s bedroom classics like " Behind Closed Doors " and " The Most Beautiful Girl in the World " are fine foreplay tunes . Neither Bob or Rod had heard of Charlie Rich . I then asked , " How about Buddy Rich ? " referencing the late maniac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> After a few Leinenkugel Reds ( $ 2.75 a bottle ) , we struck up a conversation with Joann Jewell , a 31-year-old supper club waitress . In a warm and friendly manner , she gave us more information about the history of the Don Q than anyone at the front desk . Her father is Ron Dentinger . It 's that kind of connections that make small town visits fun . <p> Besides being former general manager at the Don Q Inn , Dentinger is an ex-Milwaukee cop . He delivered 17 babies in a five-year stint as a patrolman . These days he writes jokes for Rodney Dangerfield and Reader 's Digest . He even does local humor : " A dummy tried to rob the local bank in Dodgeville with a sawed-off shotgun , " Dentinger said in a Dangerfield accent . " But he had sawed off the wrong end . " Rim shot with that gun , please . <p> " I used to describe Dodgeville as a place with history so vivid you can touch it , " Dentinger said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of people like Don , but thank God there 's a few . <p> " In 1978 he had some matchbooks printed up . In big silver letters they said " Thym 's House of Fine Foods . ' ( Thym 's Supper Club is across Highway 23 from the motel . ) And in small letters , ' Across the street from the Don Q Inn . ' He cleared it with the owner before he had them printed . " <p> The next morning we awoke in Don 's Den , ready to meet our friend Marty in the neighboring town of New Glarus , a k a " America 's Little Switzerland . " But we were in for big trouble when my car would n't start . Apparently it had been on Don Q 's frozen tundra too long . We never left the hotel once we checked in around dinner time on a Friday night . <p> A jump did n't help and the locals found delight in informing city slickers that no gas stations were open until Monday morning ( when the car started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Motors dealer . A friend of the tow truck driver was kind enough to give us a ride to Gordon 's Cafe , a downtown coffeehouse and restaurant where we arranged to meet Marty . Gordon 's is across the street from the Land 's End Outlet Store , 113 N. Iowa St. <p> Once Marty showed up , I began telling him about our tribulations . Carla Lind , the owner of Thistle Hill Tabletop Company , was sitting at the next table at Gordon 's . She overheard our conversation and asked if she could help . <p> Lind called the home of Dean Martin , the salesman at the dealership where my car had been towed . Dean was in the shower , but he agreed to meet us at the dealership to get us a loaner . He was on his way to an appointment . He did n't have to help out , but he did . <p> As Dean was filling out paperwork , I wondered aloud how difficult it is to go through life being Dean Martin . " I do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have a good time with it . " He added that Dodgeville does n't have any residents named Jerry Lewis . <p> Several minutes later we pulled out of the parking lot in our loaner . It was a silver ' 94 Lumina , clocking in at 148,000 miles . The car was the size of the plane in the front yard of the Don Q Inn . I felt like it was 1973 and I was in high school again . My girlfriend scooted a little closer on the split bench seats and a Charlie Rich song played across my mind . The riches of travel pay off in the most peculiar moments . <p> To get to the Don Q Inn , take Interstate 90 north to Madison , Wis . Take the Highway 12/18 Beltway west to 18/151 ( Dodgeville exit ) . Head south on 18/151 to Dodgeville , exit Highway 18 . Go southwest two miles to a four-way stoplight , which is Route 23 . Turn right . You ca n't miss it . It 's got that big plane on the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 800 ) 666-7848.
