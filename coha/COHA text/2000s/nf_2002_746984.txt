On-line Phosphate Measurement Helps Rock Creek Manage Permit Compliance <p> The Rock Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Hillsboro , Oregon , operated by Clean Water Services ( formerly United Sewerage Agency ) serves about 180,000 residences in the Hillsboro area . During dry summer months , the low flow in Rock Creek makes it necessary for the plant to perform more complete nutrient removal on effluent discharged into the stream . Joe Danzer , operation analyst for the Wastewater Treatment Department , said , " Permit levels during the summer months require use of alum to precipitate the remaining phosphorus following the Bio-P Stage . " <p> Their permit requires reporting monthly averages , so keeping levels as low as possible allows the plant an occasional excursion . Joe explains , " Our permit level of 0.1 ppm is lower than the conventional pocket tester can detect , and running large numbers of lab samples can become cost prohibitive . We needed to know near real-time levels to allow us better control over the alum dosing . " <p> Clean Water Services purchased one unit for evaluation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second analyzer . Isco 's Spectron PO4-P now has provided Clean Water Services reliable phosphate analysis for its Rock Creek Plant for the last two years . <p> Danzer is very impressed with the Spectron 's performance . " Cross-reference sampling and testing of the analyzer versus a lab auto analyzer of more than 180 comparable samples produced a 0.23 mg/L difference in the means ( see graph ) . The analyzer always produced the higher value . The difference is repeatable , and the analyzer 's offset software feature can be utilized to duplicate the lab result . " The analyzer 's reliability has allowed Joe to reduce the number of samples tested by the laboratory , and the analyzer 's online data allows for more timely process adjustments . <p> Danzer is impressed with the low reagent and standard consumption , minimal maintenance requirement and the analyzer 's reliability . " We use about 25 milliliters of ammonium vanadate and about 5 milliliters of each standard every day . This is very low reagent consumption for an on-line analyzer . " <p> The plant experienced only one part failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the instrument continued to function and the output was displayed by the plant SCADA system . <p> Based on his experience of the Spectron since the summer of 1999 , Danzer said , " I would recommend the Isco-STIP Spectron to anyone interested in measuring ortho-phosphate to low levels .

A semicircular counter lined with keyboards , monitors and telephones in front of a wall of 72 ? projection displays . Is it the Starship Enterprise ? NASA headquarters ? The Monday Night Football control room ? <p> Actually , this control center monitors processing of 180 million gallons of wastewater every day for the city of San Diego 's Clean Water Operations Management Network ( COMNET ) , one of the world 's largest control and information systems linking wastewater facilities . COMNET uses technology from Emerson Process Management Power &; Water Solutions ( formerly Westinghouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations over 450 square miles . <p> In the early 1990s , San Diego 's Metropolitan Wastewater Department ( MWWD ) embarked on an expansion of its regional wastewater facilities , an effort that would become the largest clean water initiative in the nation . To control its expanded infrastructure , San Diego and Emerson developed COMNET , a management system integrating all automation , monitoring and information systems for its entire wastewater process . COMNET does more than control the new four-plant structure , it also improves efficiency and reduces costs . <p> San Diego 's COMNET uses the Ovation information and control system , the first distributed control system to offer real-time , mission-critical control on a PC platform while providing performance and power . Ovations open architecture reduces the risk of obsolescence associated with proprietary control systems and is incorporated easily into existing IT strategies , making operational information more accessible . <p> Using Ovation , San Diego integrated Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ( SCADA ) technology , and now can control more than 100 smaller pumping plants and valve stations through COMNET . While each facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the COMNET central station is in full control of points throughout the treatment system . <p> The COMNET station has two operations consoles with five computer workstations and printers , telephone and radio communications , and access to closed-circuit television at each of its four primary treatment facilities . Four 72 ? projection displays allow for additional monitoring . Information is real time , continuously updated every second , with 3-D graphical representations of the treatment process at each facility . The 24-hour-staffed central station provides full remote control of each facility without a local operator . <p> Advances in process control and the support and services provided by Emerson have offered San Diego a variety of advantages . Savings are realized through better chemical control in the normal sewage treatment process . In the past , San Diego often overcompensated and overused chemicals in the treatment process to assure the right amount for fluctuating flow . Today , Ovation allows its plants to flow-pace chemicals . Pinpoint accuracy in the releasing process allows San Diego to avoid waste and results in big savings . <p> Ovation also increases energy efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as large pumps to assure efficient operation . A value engineering study showed that San Diego will realize a cost savings of more than $100 million over 20 years due to COMNET and Ovation . Emerson Process Management PREFORMATTED TABLE Tri-Stack Roof Exhaust Systems Eliminate Odors at Wastewater Treatment Facilities <p> Tri-Stack roof exhaust systems , with their unique mixed flow technology operation , provide a highly efficient method of odor control at wastewater treatment facilities , particularly when compared against chemical additives or expensive hardware such as precipitators , scrubbers , thermal oxidizers and charcoal filters . <p> Mixed flow technology is both practical and cost-effective . Odor is eliminated by dilution ( mixing fresh air with the wastewater process exhaust gases until a suitable concentration is reached and the odor is no longer perceptible or objectionable ) . Dilution is achieved either through direct dilution ( the most efficient and cost-effective method ) , by drawing fresh air into the fan to mix with the exhaust stream before it leaves the fan ; or , indirectly , which is influenced by atmospheric conditions such as wind speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan is diluted by the atmosphere . <p> Mixed flow impeller fans are highly effective because they draw nearly twice the amount of fresh air as exhaust air into the fan 's exhaust and send it upward in a " jet plume " at a high exit velocity ( up to 7,000 ft. /rain ) . The jet velocity induces large amounts of outside air ( up to 170 percent ) to be drawn into the plume providing immediate relief of odor perception , and sending the odor laden gas/air mixture high into the atmosphere .

TT Technologies PREFORMATTED TABLE Sanitary District 's Choice of Patented Biosolids Storage-and-Mixing System Improves a Long-Standing Program <p> In 1973 , the Springfield Metro Sanitary District ( SMSD ) , Springfield , Illinois , began spraying biosolids onto crops in a land application program . It worked well until 1993 when the Environmental Protection Agency created new regulations regarding nitrate levels . To get into compliance , the SMSD chose a design that actually improved the process . The major modifications  --  Aquastore tanks coupled with the JetMix Vortex Mixing System  --  proved more energy efficient , nearly maintenance-free and effective . <p> These modifications kept the SMDS within its project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost about $3.5 million . The eventual solution cut that figure in half . Also , the storage-and-mixing solution allowed the SMSD to meet regulations with little impact on disposal . <p> Settled sludge results in accumulation of solids , " dead areas " in the center of tanks or chunks of sludge that rise to the surface . These problems make pumping the sludge for land application more difficult . <p> The trouble with most mixing systems is that they vary in effectiveness . Continuous mixing is expensive , requires a lot of energy and maintenance , and is unreliable . Options like fixed liquid jets and pivoting propeller mixers are only partially effective in mixing stored contents . <p> Infrequent mixing uses far less energy as the biosolids need only be mixed several days before application . However , while intermittent mixing has definite advantages , it poses a major problem : obtaining a homogenous mixture is difficult , and a homogenous mix is necessary for the best land application . <p> Still , the District was attracted to the energy savings . After careful evaluation , SMSD opted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was developed especially to tackle the kinds of problems associated with long-term sludge storage and sludge disposal . With its simple components , JetMix sweeps all areas of a tank by creating a unique toroidal flow pattern . Essentially , its floor-mounted nozzles combine with the action of recirculation pumps to keep solids suspended , resulting in a homogenous mix . <p> The system is easy to operate . The nozzle arrangement creates a good rotation of the tank contents to resuspend them . Nozzle adjustment is not normally required for most applications . Even after the tank sits idle for several months , the solids can be resuspended without involved operator attention . Even maintenance is simple with only the external pump requiring periodic service . By using two recirculation pumps , the SMSD can resuspend solids in 36 to 48 hours . <p> The energy savings using JetMix are substantial . The SMSD estimates that it saves $170,000 , or approximately 90 percent of the power costs otherwise required during a three-month storage period . Annually , that adds up to $680,000 . <p> The new equipment allowed SDMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during times when land application is prohibited . More expensive options such as buying additional land , would have cost as much as $7 million . <p> Also , the District realizes significant savings on maintenance . <p> When normal care is taken , the SMSD tanks can be pumped empty of biosolids , and the storage-tank nozzles can be used to clean the tank through a combination of spraying patterns .

PREFORMATTED TABLE Moreno Valley RWRF Digester Mixing Study <p> In 1998 , Eastern Municipal Water District ( EMWD ) replaced the digester gas mixing system at their Hemet/San Jacinto RWRF with external pump mixing and realized a significant increase in digester performance and gas production . In April through June of 2001 the gas mixing systems of the four Moreno Valley RWRF anaerobic digesters were replaced with the Vaughan Rotamix mixing system . <p> In 1998 EMWD experimented with larger external pump mixing systems at Hemet and saw a significant increase in digester gas production . It was decided to install similar external pump mixing systems for each of the four Moreno Valley digesters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system consists of a 2,100 gpm Vaughan chopper pump and four internal nozzles sized and oriented to provide a dual-zone rotational mixing pattern . These pumps provide the flow necessary to give 90 percent complete mixing in 30 minutes . <p> Each of the newly installed systems are only operated when the digesters are being fed and for a short period afterwards . On average , about 1.5 of . the 4 mixing systems are continuously operating . <p> Besides improving digester performance the project resulted in operating cost savings of about $200,000 per year due to reduced electrical and natural gas energy consumption .

PREFORMATTED TABLE At Last , A Solution for Wet Well Grease , Fat and Oil <p> The tendency of floatable grease , fat and oil to collect in lift station wet wells has long been a costly operational nuisance for most towns , cities and municipalities . <p> In the past , many strategies have been employed , all with mixed results . Many operators report experiments with chemical and mechanical remedies , and some have resorted to the expensive approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This problem can cause a host of complications including failure of lift station level controls , reduced equipment reliability and odor problems . Until now , there have been no satisfactory solutions . <p> However , USFilter has solved this problem with a simple , economical yet innovative system . Notably , this system has already proven itself in major North American installations and is now available for full deployment nationally . <p> In speaking about his grease problem , explained a representative of a major Arizona municipality , " We had a 12 inch to 18 inch mat per week and it has knocked it down to basically just the floaties or debris that is normally associated with a wastewater lift station . Actually works quite well . " <p> The key to the USFilter system is its proprietary Accell treatment . Accell treatment is a non-toxic , non-corrosive and environmentally-safe solution for grease control . The Accell treatment provides cost effective results without the hazards and drawbacks associated with solvents , enzymes or specialized bacteria . <p> Accell treatment can be applied to prevent grease , fat and oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipelines .

The 600 ' section of 48 " OD sewer line remained in service without the benefit of rehabilitation since its construction in the 1860s . However , over time , the continued increase of " inflow and infiltration " became sufficient enough to warrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the repair itself , but choosing the best method of repair to preserve the street in its original form . Traditional " dig and replace " methods were definitely out of the question . That left only one choice : cured-in-place-pipe ( CIPP ) rehabilitation . <p> The City of Columbus chose National Liner as the preferred method of CIPP rehabilitation . The installation was performed by U-Liner Mid-America , an American Water Services company ( formerly Pinker Pipeline Renewal ) . <p> National Liner was inserted through an upstream manhole , eliminating the need for entry or exit pits . Water pressure then was used to expand the resin-impregnated 48 ? liner against the inner wall of the host pipe . Due to the liner 's diameter , wall thickness and the volume of water used , it took approximately 15 hours for the liner to cure . Inspection after the cure confirmed the bond between the CIPP liner and the inner wall of the host pipe and material performance specifications were exceeded . The end result was a significant reduction in inflow and infiltration . National Envirotech Group PREFORMATTED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
