APRIL 1865 <p> They came out of the darkness , riding lean , hungry horses . The engineer put down his unlit pipe and reached for the shotgun in the cab , but then relaxed . The riders were Reb cavalry , not goddamned bluecoats . He could tell by their slouch hats , the mishmash of uniforms and weapons , and those big CS belt buckles gleaming in the engine 's headlight . The officer who appeared to be in charge rode right up to the locomotive . The others slowed to a walk and spread out in a fan around the train 's guard detail , who were lounging in the grass beside the tracks while the engine took on water . The riders were greeting the men with soft drawls and questions about what was going on up there in Richmond city . <p> The officer wore the insignia of a major , and he tipped his hat to the engineer with his left hand while holding the reins close down to the saddle with his right . He was wearing a dirty white duster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Major Prentice Lambert , at your service , suh , " he declared . He had a hard , hatchet-shaped face with black eyes and fierce eyebrows . " This the documents train ? " <p> The engineer said yes , a little surprised that the major knew . There were only four cars behind the engine and its tender , three of them passenger cars stuffed to the windows with boxes of official records from the various government departments up in Richmond . The twenty-man guard detail rode in the fourth car , but they were all disembarked for a smoke break and calls of nature . The guards , who were an odd mixture of old men , teenagers , and even some walking wounded from the trenches at Petersburg , seemed relieved to see Confederate cavalry . <p> The major nodded , as if the engineer 's answer were hugely significant . The engine puffed a shot of steam from the driver cylinder , spooking the major 's horse sideways , but his rider held him firmly . <p> " Any more trains behind you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand as the horse danced around . <p> The engineer shook his head . " We heard ol ' Jeff Davis took one south two nights ago , but ai n't nothin ' comin ' down thisaway that I know of . Jig 's ' bout up in Richmond . " <p> " All right , then , " the major said . He raised the big Colt Dragoon he 'd been holding down beside his saddle horn , pointed it at the engineer 's belly , and fired . <p> The engineer sat down hard on the steel grate of the engine cab , the wind knocked clean out of him and this awful , ripping feeling in his guts . He grasped his midsection with both hands and felt the blood streaming . He was dimly aware of more shooting now , as that arc of cavalrymen also opened fire , shooting down the stunned soldiers where they sat in the grass or leaned against trees , all their weapons still back on the train . He bent over to look down at his middle , lost his balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then rolled into the grass . His knees stung where he 'd hit the track bed , but then that pain faded and he relaxed into the sweet feel of that long , cool grass against his cheek . His middle was going cold now , and his legs were buzzing with pins and needles . <p> He looked back up at the train , his vision shrinking into a redhazed tunnel . He saw a single white face at the nearest window in the front car , a young face , no more than a kid , maybe fifteen , sixteen . One of the guards ? He tasted salt in the back of his throat , and it was becoming really hard to get a breath of air . <p> Why had n't that kid gotten off the train ? What was he doing in there among all those boxes , while his comrades outside were being slaughtered like beeves ? <p> One of the horsemen saw the kid 's face and surged his horse forward , his black cap-and-ball pistol pointing at the window . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Not him . Leave that one be . " <p> The horseman reined up . " That 's your spy ? That boy ? " <p> " Train was right here when it was supposed to be , were n't it ? " <p> " Yeah , but you said , now . No goddamned witnesses . " <p> " There wo n't be , " the major said , getting down off his horse , " but I need to know one more thing . " <p> Then the engineer heard the other horseman swear . He realized he 'd been spotted , eavesdropping on their conversation . He tried to crawl up the bank , trying to get under the locomotive , but his limbs had turned to rubber . He thought he heard the major say , " Oh , goddammit , " and then a bolt of lightning exploded in his head and he was gone to see the Baby Jesus . <p> Excerpted from NIGHTWALKERS by P. T.
