Probably the only thing most people care to know about their gurgling inner organs is that they are functioning properly . But for Jean-Pierre Barral , an osteopath practicing in Grenoble , France , the body 's vital viscera are like a beautifully complicated timepiece , each part in subtle but perpetual motion relative to the others . " In a single day , your internal organs move 30,000 times , " he says . " Your liver alone travels 600 meters . " <P> Problems arise , according to Barral , when a trauma or malfunction puts the mechanism out of alignment . " An organ that loses its mobility can throw the whole organism out of whack , " he says . " Our task is to help it get back on track . " To that end , Barral , 56 , has spent nearly three decades developing the therapeutic technique he calls visceral manipulation . <P> Here 's how it works : using only his hands , Barral coaxes the kidneys , liver , stomach and other soft tissues back to their natural movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urogenital areas . In this way , he claims to have successfully treated ailments ranging from chronic back and joint pain to indigestion , infection , incontinence , migraines and even impotence and sterility . <P> Barral came naturally to his vocation . " My grandmother was a healer , and I always liked to touch people , " he says . Working as a physical therapist before receiving his osteopathic training in England , he discovered that each internal organ has a capacity to cause pain to the spinal column , whereas conventional osteopathic thinking assumed the opposite . " At the time nobody was talking about manipulating organs , " he recalls , " but I kept seeing patients with aches and pains that I could relieve simply by kneading their organs . " <P> Initially , Barral 's gentler , hands-on approach met with skepticism . But some in the medical community are starting to recognize its benefits . Visceral manipulation has become part of the standard curriculum at all European osteopathic schools , while seminars in the U.S. , Japan and Russia are drawing large crowds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's population , nearly one-third of Barral 's patients have been referred by mainstream doctors . " We often get called in when regular medicine ca n't do anything , " he says . " That 's where being an organ mechanic is a beautiful thing . There are n't many of us , and there are a lot of organisms out there that need help . " <P>  --  By Tala Skari/Paris
