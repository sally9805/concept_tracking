Sidebar Food Editor 's Tips Q When I 'm shopping in the supermarket or fish store , I often see fish that 's labeled " farm-raised . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as catfish , trout , and salmon , once caught only in their natural habitats , are now farm raised ( also called aquacultured or cultured ) . In general , this means the fish are raised under somewhat controlled conditions ; they are available year  --  round , consistent in quality , and stable in price . The quality of wild fish , on the other hand , is affected by the seasons , weather , and the available food supply . It 's no surprise that farm fishing has become increasingly popular ; aquaculture production has more than doubled in the last decade . On the downside , many people feel that farm-raised fish lack the full flavor of their wild counterparts . High-quality fish stores will often carry the wild varieties when they 're in season . But it 's really a matter of individual taste ; some people may prefer the milder taste of farm-raised fish . Q I 've seen " line-caught sea bass " and " diver scallops " on menus in some upscale restaurants . Is this just fancy wording , or does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A No , those adjectives are n't meaningless embellishments . When fish are caught on a line , or when scallops are collected by divers , the seafood can be of superior quality if handled properly after harvest . It 's been caught alive , and it is fresher , less bruised , and more flavorful than fish that may have been piled with hundreds of others in industrial fishing nets . Q What 's the difference between stone-ground cornmeal and regular supermarket brands ? Can I use them interchangeably in recipes ? A Dried kernels of field corn ( different from the sweet corn we eat fresh ) are ground into meal for baking . When metal grinders are used , as they are for commercial brands , most of the hull and germ is removed , and the meal emerges fine-grained but without much characteristic flavor . Stone-ground cornmeal ( the corn is literally ground between two slowly moving stones ) retains some of the hull and germ , so it 's coarser in texture and lends a more interesting flavor to baked goods . Still , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow or white cornmeal ( they 're ground from different varieties of corn ) affects only the color of the finished product . Sidebar Another Good Reason to Eat Fish Despite a reputation for clogging arteries and packing on unwanted pounds , all fats are not villainous . Indeed , one type of polyunsaturated fat , Omega-3 , is thought to combat heart disease . Omega-3s help inhibit the formation of blood clots and reduce the incidence of heartbeat abnormalities . Preliminary studies also suggest that these fats possibly have a beneficial effect in the treatment of other disorders , ranging from asthma to rheumatoid arthritis . Where do you find Omega-3s ?
