<p> Skidaway Island  --  For 20 years , a scientist near Savannah has taken weekly water samples from the same dock , giving him a composite snapshot of the estuary 's health . <p> Pieced together , the view goes from good to fair and getting worse . Peter Verity 's data tells him the estuary  --  where rivers wrestle with the sea  --  is in trouble . <p> Dissolved oxygen , the breath of life for shrimp , blue crabs , oysters and fish , is declining at an alarming rate . Within 10 years , Verity , a professor at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography , predicts there wo n't be enough left for the sea life we love to eat . Those creatures will be replaced by jellyfish , which do n't need as much dissolved oxygen and feed on the type of organisms that grow in a polluted estuary , he says . <p> Verity 's already witnessed change . Between 1987 and 2000 , his sampling showed a 70 percent increase in jellyfish . <p> Verity and other scientists who have researched similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single word : people . <p> As more homes , condominiums , marinas and businesses are built on the coast , pollution increases in tidal creeks and estuaries . Treated sewage discharges and storm water runoff carry fertilizers from lawns , golf courses and farms and oil and other pollutants from pavement and rooftops . <p> " We need to stop what we 're doing now and either mitigate or reduce the impacts because we 're going downhill in a hurry , " Verity said . <p> Verity presented his dissolved oxygen research in June at an international conference of his peers and published it this month in an academic journal , Estuaries and Coasts . His bottom line : Georgia 's bays and inlets , lined with tidal marshes now teeming with infant and juvenile sea life , is headed toward hypoxia , a dead zone incapable of supporting shellfish and fish . <p> Hypoxia is already severe at times in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast and in the Chesapeake Bay near Washington . An associated problem , harmful algae blooms that release fish-killing toxins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dealing economic blows to seafood industries worldwide . <p> Data collected by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources along the coast tracks Verity 's findings . But the state has only been extensively monitoring water quality for about six years . <p> Spud Woodward , the assistant director of the Georgia Coastal Resources Division , which regulates marine fisheries , said there is n't enough information to know how much shrimp , blue crabs , oysters and fish are suffering from man-made changes to the state 's coastal landscape . <p> " The multimillion-dollar question is what are those effects going to mean for the life support for species that we place great value on ? That 's what we would like to know , " Woodward said . " A lot of that change we want to blame on man , but a lot of that is due to natural fluctuations , I think . It 's like the debate on global warming  --  how much of that is man and how much of it is the natural variation that you 're going to see out there ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Verity is studying the Skidaway River , a state-appointed group of public officials , business owners , developers , consultants and environmentalists have been debating a seemingly simple question since May : What is waterfront property ? <p> Their answer could have far-reaching impacts on the way the Georgia coast develops  --  and ultimately on the health of Georgia 's estuaries and marshes . <p> Coastal marshes are green and brown cane-like grasses that grow in the salty mixture of tidal waters between the sea-facing barrier islands and the mainland . In Georgia , they form a protective band four to six miles wide and encompass an area of about 378,000 acres . The state 's marshlands are considered to be among the nation 's most extensive and productive . They are the nursery for young fish and shellfish . <p> Under the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act , a state law passed in 1970 , the state claimed ownership of the tidal marshes and required landowners to seek permission before building community docks , marinas , bridges and causeways across them . It is the state 's only tool for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitting developers against environmentalists have called the state 's authority into question . <p> Developers , who have been on the losing end of three separate court decisions , say the state only has the right to regulate the construction of structures in or over the tidal marsh , such as a marina . Environmentalists say the law gives the state the right to regulate development along the entire waterfront , including hotels and swimming pools , single-family homes and condominiums . Their argument is that storm water runoff from the paved surfaces and rooftops has an impact on the marsh and as such must be regulated by the state . <p> To help clarify the law , the state Board of Natural Resources earlier this year appointed the Uplands Stakeholder Group  --  the people who have been debating coast land regulations since May . They are to come up with suggestions for regulating storm water runoff , limiting paved surfaces and creating buffers , the natural areas that separate the marsh from development . The group is set to vote on recommendations Aug. 21 . <p> While the stakeholders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have reached consensus on one point . Left unchecked , man-made pollution will ruin Georgia 's marshlands . <p> Committee member Duane Harris , former director of the state 's Coastal Resources Division and now a consultant to developers , said at July 's meeting , " What we do here is not going to matter unless the Board of Natural Resources and the General Assembly does something to protect the coast . " <p> Samples hold surprises <p> When Verity arrived at the Skidaway Institute two decades ago after getting his doctorate in biological oceanography from the University of Rhode Island , he decided to keep doing what he 'd learned there : sample water for dissolved oxygen levels . At the time , researchers thought a lack of oxygen was unlikely to ever plague Georgia 's estuaries and marshes . They assumed constant movement of sea water along Georgia 's 90-mile coastline would create enough churn to ensure high oxygen levels . <p> Still , Verity made water sampling a weekly routine . He figured at least it would be a good technique for his students to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised him . During hot summer months , dissolved oxygen in the estuary he sampled dropped to levels nearly lethal to sea life . <p> " People did n't think dissolved oxygen could go down , " Verity said . <p> This year , after his research proved the worsening trend , he received a $450,000 National Science Foundation grant to collect another five years ' worth of data . <p> Verity says he 'll need a lot more money  --  he estimates $1.8 million over five years  --  to track what is causing the decline in dissolved oxygen . <p> " We need to start taking steps now while the problems are relatively small , " he said . <p> If the blue crabs , shrimp , oysters and finned fish abandon the Georgia coast to bacteria and jellyfish , it could cost millions of dollars to bring them back , he said . <p> Taxpayers have contributed nearly $4 billion over 10 years to restoring the Chesapeake Bay 's health . They 'll keep paying . The federal government has demanded the bay be cleaned up by 2010 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion and $28 billion . <p> If Georgia 's coastal waters reach a similar crisis , Verity said , " It may be we 're not paying for it , but the next generation will .
