. An ode to the legs of skiers . Have you ever really looked at your legs ? Of course you have . You 're a skier , and we skiers obsess about our legs . Our sticks . Pins . Gams . Those are where we feel the barracuda bite of lactic acid . They 're to blame when we get heaved off our line by moguls  --  and to be thanked that one time in 50 when we manage to nail a Jonny Moseley zipperline . If our legs are soft and gelatinous and beg us to quit skiing at 2 p.m. , they should be billed . In that case , they 're costing us money . Over time , skiers become " leg men " or " leg women " even if our Freudian hardwiring makes us find other body parts more sexually attractive . We find shapeless cankles or bird legs automatically distasteful . As my skier pal Marc puts it , " I 'm turned off by women with Nicole Ritchie legs . Skinny knees look like impending carnage , like splinters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booty way before Soul Train . So what if our sturdier ski racers will never be confused with bikini models ? The fact is , the U.S. Women 's Ski Team would have won zero gold medals in the ' ' 90s if Picabo Street 's trunk were n't roughly the size of a Buick LeSabre 's . Calves bedevil us . Sure , we appreciate the ankle flexion they authorize ; without them , it 'd be impossible to jam your shins against your boot tongues and rip turns . On the other hand , calves do n't work as hard as the rest of the leg while we 're skiing because our feet stay pretty flat and quiet . As far as skiing goes , calves do n't have much to do , yet  --  skinny or plump  --  they really complicate bootfitting . To build up our legs for skiing , we read the fitness sections of magazines like this one . In the off-season , we mountain bike or , if we 're masochists , go running . We go to the gym for lunges and one-legged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leg for skiing like skiing . So last week , in pursuit of my first ski turns in seven months , I skinned up to 11,900 feet in Colorado 's San Juan Mountains . Three hours of kicking and striding , contracting and flexing the hunk of meat between waist and knee . I always thought the quads and hamstrings powered me up tracks , but a lot more credit goes to the gluteus maximus , the heaviest muscle in the human body . We humans use it to take a step . Gorillas , interestingly , do n't have glutes , and get no love at all from Sir Mix-a-Lot . Their butts are bonier than whichever Olsen twin it was who went anorexic . Earning your turns would be impossible without the gluteus maximus . As a result , backcountry ski tourers rarely encounter gorillas , or for that matter Olsen twins . At the summit , I ripped off my skins , stuffed them in my pack , and told my glutes to take a breather . It was thigh time now . The downhill . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want mine back , because it was a half-assed little feint to the left . Still , it was a ski turn , and Woody Allen 's description of sex certainly applies : " Even when it 's bad , it 's pretty good . " My next turns went much better . I sank into a crouch , weighted one ski or the other , and demanded some snappy extensions from my thighs . Do n't ask me which muscles exactly . The thigh contains 13 separate ones . Some act only at the hip joint , others only at the knee , while still others act at both joints . The quadriceps femoris is , to be sure , a primary mover and shaker . It 's our most powerful muscle and the sole executor of knee extension . Skiing , though , is a complex and specialized behavior and employs other muscles for balance and control . We should quit giving quads all the credit and shout out some props to the others , too . For instance , the satorius  --  a strap that runs diagonally across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the longest muscle in the body . All 13 thigh muscles come together to help skiers absorb bumps and hold turns at speed . In elite skiers , they bulge into voluptuous pulchritude . Enlarged thigh muscles are why racer Kate McBride has to buy men 's jeans . They 're why Bode Miller goes to photo shoots for men 's magazines , finds 27 pairs of pants with his waist size to model , and discovers he ca n't fit in any of them . Says Bode in his autobiography , " I 'm surprised racers like Dane Spencer and Chip Knight , who have legs like bridge abutments , do n't wear sarongs . " Still , for all its girth , the thigh remains alarmingly vulnerable . When I drop a backcountry slope , it 's hard not to think of what happened at Teton Pass back in 2001 when Jeff Douthitt , 28 , a Jackson-area local and experienced mountaineer , was skiing the pass with two friends . They were just 400 yards from the highway , descending ably and in control . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crusty ski tracks hidden beneath new powder . He biffed . His ski pole snapped . One of the jagged edges stabbed his thigh about six inches above his knee . His friends heard him scream . He 'd punctured his femoral artery . Douthitt pretty much bled to death in the 10 minutes it took his partners to hike back up to him . The Teton County Search and Rescue coordinator said simply , " It looks like he was in the wrong place at the wrong time . I do n't think there are any lessons that could have been learned here . " When I first heard about the accident , I filed it under Could Happen to Anyone , the scariest file of all . Evolution has foisted incredible weight and responsibility on the legs . We are , after all , walking  --  and skiing  --  with a skeleton designed for quadrupeds . The legs ' stresses and load bearing are intense . Still , skiers should be glad we evolved from knuckle draggers into bipeds . As the German satirist Georg Lichtenberg said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on two legs , but it was a noble invention . " Indeed , it gave us hands . Without those , how would we ever tip the masseuse ?
