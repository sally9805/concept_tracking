<p> John Jasper began his career as an apprentice programmer at SEI right after graduating from high school in 1982 . While he left SEI twice , he never strayed far from the Chicago-based software development and technical support company . Last year Jasper returned to SEI , this time as CEO . <p> During his first stint at SEI , from 1983-1992 , Jasper slowly evolved from a " hot-shot geek " programmer to a consultant focused on " enhancing the business . " He left SEI the first time to work as lead architect for Navigation Technologies , an SEI spin-off that powers popular driving direction Web sites such as Mapquest and Yahoo Maps . <p> The most surprising thing about developing mapping software , Jasper says , was that " somebody pretty much had to drive every road in America " to find accurate addresses , turn restrictions , and one-way streets . But thorough preparation is nothing new for Jasper , who stresses the importance of strong tech support . <p> Q. What does SEI do ? <p> A. SEI was founded in 1969 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We now have two main divisions . One builds software solutions and does consulting . <p> The other provides technical support and ongoing maintenance for operations like the point-of-sale devices in 8,000 McDonald 's . We provide support for a host of software products for 20 or 30 different retail outlets across the country . It 's not just maintenance , but it 's providing interfaces to the user community to allow them to get their technology issues resolved . <p> People underestimate the importance of tech support . There are a lot of interesting statistics out there that show that effective back-end support is often the difference between a perceived product launch failure and a perceived success . <p> Q. You went straight from high school to SEI . Why did you decide not to go to college ? <p> A. I 've taken a few classes here and there , but never anything specifically oriented towards a degree , so I guess I 'm in that elite crowd with Mr. Gates . <p> I started programming around age 13 . My father was a gambler . He wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program for his book . <p> His programs purported to help someone count cards or play the horses or basketball or football or whatever you wanted . I wrote the blackjack application . <p> He worked for a number of local computer firms , including SEI . Although he left before I started , he probably helped me get my first job here . I was a programmer apprentice , basically a software engineer trainee . <p> Q. Have you been with SEI continuously ? <p> A. No . I worked at SEI a few times , but my first stint lasted almost a decade . I got most of my early training starting in 1983 and in an SEI start-up called Cellular Billing Systems . We worked with some people from Motorola to develop the first cellular phone systems . <p> Motorola provided the technology and we worked on systems for billing , customer service , money handling , and all the complexities associated with launching a cellular phone business . We launched in the top 90 U.S. markets in less than two years , which was a very aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of people subscribing to cellular services . <p> Q. What are the most important skills that make a really great programmer ? <p> A. Good programmers need a tremendous capacity to manage a large amount of information in their brain in real time . Creativity and flexibility are also incredibly important . If you look at the industry icons , most of them are phenomenally creative people . They may not be brilliant programmers , but they come up with very interesting and innovative solutions to problems that seem either mundane or unsolvable . ... <p> The great programs run efficiently , quickly , make sense to users and stand the test of time . <p> Q. How did you move up the food chain at SEI ? <p> A. After working with Cellular Billing Systems , I worked for a variety of clients in the Chicago metro area . I worked for Time-Life for a number of years and became somewhat of a database guru back when Time-Life had one of the larger databases in the world . I was still in my early 20s , younger than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Navigation Technologies , a company that built digital mapping software , and I got involved in that . <p> Q. Was there a point when you underwent a transition from technologist to businessperson ? <p> A. That transition began around 1987 when I started working with NavTech . I moved away from being a young , hot-shot geek who wanted to do something cool , and started thinking about business implications . It had n't yet clicked for me that we 're here not to build software because it 's cool , but we 're here to enhance the business . I probably stayed that way for the first eight years of my career . <p> It was n't until I got to NavTech the first time that I began to really focus on " what are we doing technologically to help drive the business ? " <p> Q. What was your role with NavTech ? <p> A. I think I had the title of Chief Designer , but I was effectively the lead architect for the overall system . We built the prototype system for most of North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data for its systems , and how did they get it to work ? <p> A. In the mid-1980s , a lot of research was being done on how to help drivers get from Point A to Point B. The first product NavTech built was actually a coin-operated kiosk where you would drop in a quarter , enter your destination and it would print you a set of directions . <p> The biggest challenge Russ Shields and the other SEI principals found was n't so much the algorithms . It was getting data that actually worked . Somebody pretty much had to drive every road in America . And quite frankly , it 's a very interesting and complex data problem , which is what attracted me because I was still on the tail end of my " It 's all about cool technology . " Imagine how difficult it is to find accurate addresses , accurate turn restrictions , one-ways , dividers , things that impede a right turn or left turn . <p> These days , no one really thinks about the complexities behind calculating a route between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maps . But in 1988 , it was an incredibly challenging problem . <p> Q. Why did you come back to SEI to take on the role of CEO ? <p> A. I had always kept in touch with SEI 's founder Russ Shields and we met up when we were both on business trips in Europe . He explained the CEO was leaving , and he asked if I was interested . This was in June 2001 . <p> We 're in a challenging environment from an economic perspective right now . But with 33 years of history , we have a great track record and a great client base . <p> Dave Lundy is president of DL Strategies , a Chicago-based strategic communications firm .
