<p> Nicolas Sarkozy , the conservative candidate for president , suggests that pedophilia is most likely a genetic flaw ; Segolene Royal , the Socialist , does not seem to know that Taliban extremists are no longer running the government of Afghanistan ; and Jean-Marie Le Pen , the ultrarightist , recommends masturbation instead of free condoms to meet young people 's sexual needs . <p> With 12 days to go before the first round of France 's presidential election , the campaign has entered a phase of improvisation and even silliness that reflects the absence of any single defining issue and a frenzied competition to win over the country 's large bloc of undecided voters . <p> Every twist seems important . Monday was the " official " opening of the French campaign , in which all 12 candidates put up campaign posters across the country and began broadcasting short prepared free spots , of exactly the same length , on state-run television and radio stations . <p> But a record 42 percent of French voters say they are undecided or can still change their minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in Le Parisien on Sunday . Among voters under the age of 30 , the percentage is even higher , at 56 percent . <p> " We 're in an era where voters are more and more like shoppers , " said Roland Cayrol , the director of CSA . " They 're comparing personalities and promises the way they compare products in a supermarket . The ' look ' and the packaging is important . That means anything can change their vote  --  from a defining event in the country to a candidate 's absurd declaration . " <p> Part of the problem is what the political scientist Jacques Gerstle calls " the absence of a dominant theme , " unlike the last campaign in 2002 where the issues of security and unemployment monopolized the debate . The current campaign , he added , resembles a nationwide " zapping , " in which candidates flit from topic to topic  --  from the woes of Airbus to the private wealth of the candidates to whether every French household should keep the nation 's flag in the kitchen cupboard . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so badly that they have ruined their chances in a volatile race , pollsters say . <p> Mr. Sarkozy , the front-runner , seems to be benefiting from the uncertainty . According to political analysts , his campaign seems more disciplined and less gaffe-riddled than those of the other main candidates . In a CSA poll published Monday , for example , 59 percent of registered voters polled said they expected him to win . In a subsequent CSA poll published Tuesday , more than 60 percent judged Mr. Sarkozy 's campaign the most solid , precise and modern . <p> Mr. Sarkozy continues the struggle to soften the law-and-order image he earned in his nearly four years as interior minister . So on a campaign stop to a Reblochon cheese-making factory in the Alps in late March , he did something he does not normally do , at least in public . He flirted . <p> He enthusiastically kissed an apron-clad female employee on both cheeks , wrapping his arm around her shoulder . <p> " I 'm kissing you , eh , " Mr. Sarkozy said . Posing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are ! " and , " My heart is beating ! " <p> But Mr. Sarkozy 's angry , tough-guy reputation still dogs him . In a book to be published Wednesday , Azouz Begag , who resigned as equal opportunities minister last week , accused Mr. Sarkozy of once threatening to assault him . <p> Mr. Begag recounts an episode , just after the wave of unrest in France 's suburbs in late 2005 , in which he criticized Mr. Sarkozy for using the word " scum " to describe young delinquents . Mr. Begag said he received a phone call from Mr. Sarkozy , who , enraged , called him disloyal , and added , " I 'm going to smash your face . " <p> Mr. Sarkozy said Mr. Begag was lying . <p> But the incident in the book reinforces the image of Mr. Sarkozy as a man more feared than loved . Over the weekend , his opponents and even the Roman Catholic archbishop of Paris , Msgr . Andre Vingt-Trois , criticized him for suggesting in an interview with a philosophical magazine that pedophiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man has free will , " Monsignor Vingt-Trois said in a radio interview . " What seems to me most serious is the idea that you ca n't change the course of destiny . " <p> In the Socialist camp , there is a consensus that Ms. Royal , who is running second in the polls , has frittered away the advantages that come with running to be the first woman elected president of France . Her critics say she refuses to heed the advice of her advisers and has a penchant for adding new proposals as she goes along . <p> Eric Besson , her former chief economic adviser , quit over differences with her , then savaged her in a book published weeks later . He described her as making decisions solo , improvising policies without forethought and then portraying herself as the victim of a male-dominated news media to gain an advantage . <p> " I think , in all conscience , that Segolene Royal should not become president of the republic , " he wrote . " I do not wish it for my country . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has been criticized for trivializing the issues . At a women 's forum sponsored by Elle magazine last week , for example , she announced her three priorities for women : ending violence against women , securing more government aid for preschool children and putting the remains of Olympe de Gouges , the 18th-century feminist , into the Pantheon . The audience groaned . <p> During a campaign trip on March 30 , Ms. Royal announced a new government-subsidized initiative to put unemployed youths to work , only to be attacked by her own camp and the far left for coming up with a warmed-over version of the government 's doomed job creation initiative put forth last year . <p> Ms. Royal has been most gaffe-prone on foreign policy terrain . On a visit to China in January , she visited the Great Wall , wearing white , the color of mourning in China . <p> Last Thursday , in discussing the fate of two Frenchmen held hostage by the Taliban in Afghanistan , she called for United Nations-imposed penalties for rulers like the Taliban , as if unaware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the interviewer pointed out that the Taliban were no longer in power , Ms. Royal ignored him and moved on . <p> Francois Bayrou , the contender from the centrist Union for French Democracy party , who is running third in the polls before the first round , has run a largely gaffe-free campaign that has been criticized , however , for its vagueness . He has also been taken to task for portraying himself as a simple working farmer ( his Web site shows him pitching hay on the family farm ) when he has been a deputy in Parliament for more than two decades . <p> By contrast , Mr. Le Pen , the leader of the far-right National Front who is running in fourth place in the polls , still seems to revel in making headline-grabbing statements . <p> At the Elle forum , he defended his opposition to providing free condoms to high school students . " For those who are fixated on it , I recommend ' manu militari , ' " a tongue-in-cheek reference to masturbation . " This is the simplest method . @ @
