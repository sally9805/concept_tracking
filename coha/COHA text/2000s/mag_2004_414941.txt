You 're sitting at home with a cup of coffee , reading . Outside the window , the world is cold and wet and brown . Indoors , however , the room is suffused with sweet fragrance and bright color from a half-dozen pots of bulbs whose flowers have magically transformed winter into spring . Moreover , this cheering display could continue for weeks and will cost you less than a good bouquet or two from the florist . Fantasy , you think ? Not if you get started right now forcing your own bulbs for winter bloom . For some reason , many indoor gardeners shy away from forcing hardy bulbs , believing the process just too difficult .
