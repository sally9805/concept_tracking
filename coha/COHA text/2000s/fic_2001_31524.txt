Geordi La Forge had never before doubted the information his ocular implants imparted to his mind , but he could barely grasp the vivid spectrums and soaring electromagnetic pulses surging across the plains of Myrmidon . He staggered to remain on his feet in the fierce wind , which the phase-shifting did nothing to stop . The air smelled like tar , and his thumping heart told him this was not a sight that anyone should expect to see ... and live . Worriedly , Geordi laid hands upon the two interphase generators , each standing about two meters high , buttressed by struts and platforms . Only their phase-shifted field prevented the fifty thousand souls in the dry river bed from perishing in the holocaust . Experienced at close range , the Genesis Wave was even more spectacular than he had been led to believe . Like a wildfire set loose in a parched forest , it ripped apart all molecules in its path and recombined them on the fly  --  only it moved with incredible speed . Instead of leaving spent ashes , the wave left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with barbarous fury . Just outside their field of protection , geysers spewed and mountains dissolved in the bubbling , churning morass . The horizon was undulating like a sine wave , and people and animals were mewling with fear all around him . Without warning , the earth heaved under Geordi 's feet , and the sand swiftly dissolved into a thick liquid . His first terrified reaction was that the Genesis Effect had reached them through the ground . But when the human did n't melt into a puddle , he figured it was liquefaction of the soil . Knowing the dissolving sand was a side effect did n't make it any less horrifying . Geordi felt as if he were slogging through molasses . He lunged for the generators and the gel packs , but the heavy equipment was also shifting and sinking into the muck . La Forge squirmed to his knees and dug a shoulder into a tilting strut to keep it level . Now panic gripped scores of frightened Bolians in the riverbed , and many of their animals bolted into oblivion . Shrieking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were all going to die if sand clogged the generators . La Forge grabbed an armful of gel packs and tried to keep them from sinking out of sight while he strained to hold the rack upright . When a distraught Bolian collided with him , knocking him into the sand , Geordi felt himself slipping downward . He rolled onto his stomach and swam over the moist sand to the generators , which he grabbed like a drowning man . La Forge lifted his head and looked for his fallen comrades  --  Admiral Nechayev and Dolores Linton  --  but he could barely trust his vision . In every direction , there was nothing but turmoil . Despite the sensory overload , he tried to tell himself that only a few seconds had passed , and the worst of it would only last a few minutes . He would have to be patient and stay at his post with the generators , now half sunken into the sand . If the phase-shifting failed , nothing could keep them safe from the staggering forces reworking the planet . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had occurred just before the wave hit . Explosions had ripped through the riverbed , and they had n't seemed accidental or part of the Genesis Effect . Geordi had seen concentrated flashes that had looked like beamed weapons to him . In the melee , Admiral Nechayev and Dolores Linton had both fallen . He had seen them on the ground , but he had stayed at his post , ignoring their plight . Was it self-preservation , a sense of duty , or fear that kept me from helping them ? he wondered . A howling gust of foul-smelling wind forced him to hunker down , and he tried not to be too hard on himself . He was in the middle of a world that was hemorrhaging and birthing at the same time , and the lives of a few carbon-based animals seemed to pale beside these momentous changes . With a groan , the ground shuddered and then seemed to solidify  --  either that , or he and the equipment had sunk down to more solid rock . Maybe the effect was beginning to lessen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of the panicked inhabitants had stopped their mad flight , but many others had lost their minds entirely . In the distance , one Bolian dashed outside the protective field and dissolved like a swarm of bees breaking apart . But most of the survivors realized that there was nowhere to run . They huddled in small groups , curled protectively over the wounded . He still could n't see either Nechayev or Linton , but he mustered some hope that they would live long enough for him to get help . Help ? he thought derisively . Where ? How ? Even if they lived through this initial phase , Myrmidon 's civilization had been reduced beyond rubble to nonexistence . The churning sludge bore new life writhing in its depths , but it bore no resemblance to the sacred planet which had existed here before . All of its people 's efforts paled in comparison with the throes of Myrmidon in its destruction and rebirth . He did n't want to watch the carnage , feeling shame and helplessness , but he could n't tear his gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this ! he thought miserably . This is n't survival  --  it 's insanity . After a few moments , he found himself appreciating the fractured kaleidoscope in the sky , but the more he saw , the sadder he became . Although it looked as if much of the populace would survive , how could they live in this hellish place ? It did n't seem possible that Myrmidon would ever revert to normal , although the spirit of a proud people like the Bolians would account for a lot . They had lived , but for what purpose ? La Forge fumbled in his belt for his tricorder , thinking that it should be safe to move around soon . If the effect was beginning to ebb , or at least enter its sustainable mode , he wanted to be ready . With reluctance , he tore his attention away from the swirling sky and writhing landscape to concentrate on his readings . The effect was lessening , but it was still too complex for the tricorder to register at all levels . Although Project Genesis had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version reminded him more of the last chapter , Revelations  --  when the world was torn asunder in a great cataclysm ... and the dead rose from their graves . Captain Jean-Luc Picard rushed down the corridor leading to Transporter Room One , where Beverly Crusher and the crew of the Neptune were under arrest . At least he hoped they were under arrest , because their actions and treachery had endangered the entire operation on Myrmidon . The Enterprise had barely escaped from the Genesis Wave , because they 'd been forced to disable the rogue ship . Even so , several installations on the ground had been severely damaged , and there was no telling how many lives had been lost because of the unexpected friendly fire . The captain was hoping there would be a logical explanation , but he could n't imagine what that could possibly be . At first , he feared the attack might have something to do with the Bolians ' predilection for suicide , but there were no Bolians among the skeleton crew on the Neptune . No matter how he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially coming from the one person he trusted most  --  Beverly Crusher . Taking a deep breath , Captain Picard charged into the transporter room , ready to confront just about anything . The first thing he saw was a phalanx of Starfleet security officers ; their broad backs were toward him as they faced the transporter platform . Their weapons were lowered , and they did n't seem unduly concerned . Upon seeing the captain , the security detail opened a path for him , and he caught a glimpse of a shimmering force field stretched across the transporter platform . Stepping closer , Picard saw Nurse Ogawa and a medical team poised for action just outside the force field . He still had n't seen anyone from the Neptune , but Ogawa 's worried eyes told him where they were . Piled haphazardly like a collection of discarded dolls , Crusher and seven others lay sprawled across the transporter platform . " Are they dead ? " he asked , trying to mask his alarm with a calm tone of voice . " No , it 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ogawa consulted her tricorder , and Picard took a closer look at the distressed crew members . Now he could see them squirming weakly , gasping for breath even as they remained in a deathlike trance . He looked at Ogawa , who shook her head worriedly . " They 're alive , but they 're dying of asphyxiation . Their lungs seem to be paralyzed . Please , Captain , wo n't you allow us to help them ? " Worf was n't aboard the Enterprise anymore , but Picard could hear the Klingon warning him about quarantine procedures . He also knew that Beverly Crusher  --  the woman who meant more to him than any other  --  was curled in a fetal position , looking like she was on the brink of death . He would just have to count on the biofilters in the transporters to do their job . " Lower the force field , " ordered the captain , " and get them to sickbay . Let 's station security in sickbay until we get an explanation . " " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She rushed forward with the rest of the medteam , and they quickly applied oxygen and hypos to the sick prisoners . Within a few seconds , all of them were on portable ventilators . The captain tapped his combadge . " Picard to Riker . " " Riker here , " came the response . " I need you on the bridge , " said Picard , " while I monitor the situation in Transporter Room One . How are Counselor Troi and the Bolian girl ? " " Fine . I just dropped them off at sickbay . Deanna has a concussion , but she 'll be okay . I 'm on my way to the bridge . " " Thank you , Number One . Picard out . " When the antigrav gurneys and more medical personnel arrived , the captain just stood out of the way with the security officers until the patients were ready to be moved . As Ogawa guided Crusher 's floating gurney toward the door , the captain caught up with her . " How does it look ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscured by a respirator . " We 've stabilized them , " said Ogawa , " but she 's barely able to breathe on her own . Until we do complete scans , we ca n't say what 's wrong with them . The catatonic state looks bad , but we can deal with that . I do n't like their labored breathing . " The nurse brushed past him and out the door , leaving Picard in her wake , helpless to do anything more for Beverly . The condition of the skeleton crew was frightening enough , but it raised a disturbing question : How could they have flown the ship and fired weapons in that physical condition ? The Neptune had been a ghost ship when it arrived , and it had gone down in flames , still a ghost ship . He tapped his combadge . " Picard to bridge . " " Yes , Captain , " answered Commander Riker . " What 's our status ? " " We 're on course to the rendezvous , " answered the first officer , " and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myrmidon operation a qualified success , although there 's been no word from anyone on the planet . That wo n't be possible for at least half an hour . " " I 'll be in sickbay , " said Picard . " The Neptune crew came aboard in poor health  --  comatose , having trouble breathing . " " How 's that possible ? " asked Riker . " I do n't know , but I intend to find out . In fact , have Data review the logs of our final encounter with the Neptune . Tell him to look at everything  --  we might have missed something while it was happening . " " We 'll get right on it , " promised Riker . " Will they ... recover ? " " We do n't know enough about their condition . " The captain watched glumly as the stricken officers were pushed out on gurneys . Since the Genesis Wave appeared , there were always new questions , but never any answers . His legs churning through the gritty mire , Geordi La Forge threw himself onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth . Although the dry riverbed had stopped liquefying , it was still treacherous . The interphase generators lay half-buried in the grime at a dangerously tilted angle , and some of the gel packs were covered . He was afraid the delicate machines would give out at any moment . With a glance at the horizon , La Forge could see that the Genesis Effect was lessening , or moving into another phase . Instead of undulating and mutating , the landscape was now blossoming with misshapen trees , thick hedges , and ruby-red flowers . Overgrown stands of gnarled trees sprouted like weeds across the horizon , probably fed by water in the liquefied soil . The winds remained ferocious , whipping at the new flora like a hurricane , and the skies continued to ripple with unbridled power . Geordi began to shiver as he glimpsed snow flurries at the edge of their protective field . The survivors were relatively calm now , huddling together , shivering and staring in amazement at the evolving landscape . With a grunt , La Forge returned to the task of pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the sand had coagulated around the buried struts , and the going was tougher than ever . Geordi was weakened already from his efforts , and all he got for his strained muscles was more futility . A figure suddenly fell in beside him , also pushing and grunting against the tilted generator . With a grinding noise , the platform actually moved , and Geordi peered at his mysterious helper , who was covered with grime . " Dolores ! " he shouted with relief . " Do n't look at me , " she said jokingly . " I 'm a sight . " With a dumb smile , he gazed at the muscular young geologist , thinking she looked great , even though there was blood on her forehead and scratches all over one side of her body . " I have a mild concussion , which I deserve , " she grumbled . " I figured there would be a little liquefaction in the riverbed , but this whole thing is ... beyond what I envisioned . " " It sure is ! " agreed Geordi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Admiral Nechayev ? " Dolores gulped and glanced over her shoulder at the huddled masses . " She 's out there somewhere , but she 's hurt badly . They found her a Bolian doctor . I could n't help her . What was the deal with all those explosions ? " La Forge squinted at the swirling khaki sky . " From where I stood , it looked like an attack  --  a strafing run with phasers . But I ca n't say for sure . I 'm glad you 're here , so you can watch the generators while I take some readings . " " How much time is left ? " she asked worriedly . " I mean , before the worst of it is over ? " " I 'll try to find out . " La Forge opened his tricorder , thinking that it was impossible to guess how much time had passed . With a whole world evolving from primordial ooze right before their eyes , it seemed like eons . But it had probably been only a few minutes . He checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was something of a relief . " We 're well past the halfway point . " The engineer turned and surveyed the blooming forest , then he looked helplessly at his tricorder . " These readings do n't tell me much  --  just a lot of numbers that do n't make sense . If I did n't have to stay with the generators , I 'd like to chuck a rock outside the phase-shifting field to see what happens to it . " " I can do that , " replied the geologist with a smile . " You stay here and watch your boxes , and I 'll go to the edge . " " Not too close , " warned Geordi . " Take a tricorder and do n't get any closer to the edge than ten meters . Will that get you close enough ? " Dolores sniffed with pride . " I 'll have you know I was regional shot-put champion in college , and I competed in the Martian Olympics , where I finished second . " " It 's still dangerous , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the geologist . " That 's funny for a rock hound like me . After the Great Flood , Noah sent a dove to see if it was safe . But we 'll have to send a rock . " She stretched her grimy legs and surveyed the sticky riverbed . It was populated by frightened , dirty clumps of Bolians , who were as much in shock as any group of survivors could possibly be . With their vacant , hopeless expressions , they looked like the homeless refugees they were . " It will probably take me a minute to get there , " added Linton , scraping the mud from the sole of a boot . " We 'll try combadges , but I do n't think they 'll work . Just keep me in sight , and I 'll wave to you if it 's safe . " At his worried look , she smiled and tapped the pouch on her belt . " Do n't worry , Geordi , I 've got my tricorder . " Unexpectedly she kissed him full on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gritty from sand and sweat . Dolores pulled away , grinning , and she was one of the most dashing figures he had ever seen . " Keep dinner warm , " she said playfully . " I 'll be back . " Geordi nodded forcefully , unable to think of anything else to say . A moment later , Dolores dashed off , her strong legs churning through the mud , and he hurriedly pulled some field glasses from his toolbox . Placing the lenses to his implants , Geordi watched the strong hiker as she wound her way among the masses of people . Here and there , she offered words of encouragement to the survivors , and she also stopped to pick up and inspect several fist-sized rocks . All too soon , Dolores 's distinctive infrared image got muddled with the others , and he lost sight of her . After making a quick inspection of the generators , La Forge went back to watching the riverbed . Although all the land looked wet and new , it was easy to see where the safety net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only land in view that was n't erupting with freakish new life . In this muddy riverbed , the old life hung on with dogged tenacity . Another check of the equipment showed a twenty percent drop in power since the last check , and La Forge surveyed the perimeter with added urgency . He finally spotted Linton , crouched at the edge of the sand , facing a huge geyser that spewed brackish water eighty meters into the air . He assumed she had to be getting wet from the spray and wind , but she stayed in place , braving the ungodly elements . Through his field glasses , La Forge studied the crouched figure as intently as she studied her tricorder . Finally Dolores took a deep breath and squirmed forward on her knees . With a lunge , she hurled the rock straight toward the geyser , and he could finally comprehend her logic . Because the glistening soil around the geyser was the only smooth terrain in sight , except for the riverbed , the rock was still visible . If she had tossed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underbrush . Although he could n't see the rock any longer , he was certain Dolores could . Several tense seconds passed , and Geordi forced his eyes away from the figure on the periphery to check the generators . The primary generator was now down thirty-seven percent , probably because of the damaged gel packs . It they were going to get a reprieve from this calamity , now would be a good time , Geordi thought . He heard a cry of joy that pierced through the wind , and he looked up to see Dolores running toward him , waving her hands . " It worked ! " she cried . " The rock did n't change ! It 's all over but the shouting . " " All over ? " mumbled survivors doubtfully . It was clear that misshapen plants and squirming animal life were still growing at an accelerated pace , even if the crust of the planet had stopped its upheaval . It did n't look as if anything had changed , and La Forge was hesitant to turn off the generators . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Geordi had n't even noticed the hum until it stopped , and he saw immediately that the primary interphase generator had died . Seconds later , the other generator stopped too , making his decision moot . Geordi tensed , waiting for the Genesis Effect to rip through him , turning his body to sludge . But nothing happened . They had won the battle , and their prize was a chaotic , primitive planet that bore no resemblance to the sophisticated , peaceful world they had known . Overcoming his gloom , he ran toward Dolores , and they hugged each other with tearful relief . The moment of joy ended quickly , when he had to ask , " Where 's Admiral Nechayev ? Can you take me to her ? " Dolores nodded her head and grabbed his hand , leading the way . They wandered among the Bolians , who peppered them with questions . Geordi found himself repeating over and over , " It 's safe to leave the riverbed , but be careful out there . Stay in a group . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked an elderly Bolian . La Forge shrugged . " I do n't know . We 'll have to learn about Myrmidon all over again . " A few moments later , they reached a clutch of Bolians and Starfleet officers gathered around a prone figure . The smile erased itself from Geordi 's face when he stepped close enough to get a look at the wounded admiral . Much of Nechayev 's face and left side were badly burned , and she was unconscious , breathing with a labored rasping sound . Only a few tufts of her reddish gray hair were left on her charred skull . A Bolian doctor worked steadily on the admiral , but all he had was a first-aid kit . It was clear from the frustrated expression on his face that he was n't happy with her progress . " How is she ? " demanded La Forge . The doctor frowned , producing a ripple of double chins under his dour blue face . " If I had a proper medical facility , maybe I could help her . But out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doctor ! " someone else called , yanking on his shoulder . " You 've got to look at my wife ! Please ! " The doctor shrugged and rose to his feet . " I 'm sorry , but I 've done all I can for the admiral . Now I 've got to look at the others  --  " " Go ahead , " Dolores answered with sympathy . She knelt beside the fallen officer and picked up a bloody gauze from the sand . " All I could do was give her something for the pain , " the doctor added apologetically before he was dragged off . With moist eyes , Dolores looked up at Geordi . " If she dies , you 're pretty much in charge of this entire operation . " La Forge wanted to say reassuringly that Alynna Nechayev was n't going to die , but her gaunt visage gazed up at him , belying those words . He watched helplessly as a light snow fell on the admiral 's charred face and cranberry-hued uniform .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
