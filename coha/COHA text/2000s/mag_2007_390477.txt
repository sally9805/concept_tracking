Headnote The coming fight for the melting north On the first full day of the sovereignty operation , the captain slowed the frigate and we took out the machine guns and sprayed the Northwest Passage with bullets . It felt pretty good . It was foggy , and die unpolluted water boiled as we polluted it with lead . There was no life we could see , and few waves . The wind was cold , die Arctic Ocean a drab green . There was n't any ice . But if there had been ice , we would have shot it . The guns were C7s - American M16s but rechristened , like many Canadian weapons , with a patriotic " C " - and most of the shooters were camo-clad teenagers from Quebec 's celebrated 22e Regiment , who are known as the Vandoos , from vingt deux ( " twenty-two " ) . The Vandoos lined up three in a row on the back deck , each of them held in place by a sturdy navy man , and fired away in the spirit of joint-operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot more . They switched to pistols and then shotguns and shot until the deck was littered with shells . When they finished , they kicked the shells into the sea . There were journalists on board , and the Arctic was warming , and the Canadians - a peaceful people , a people who take immense pride in their own decency - were trying their hardest to seem violent , dangerous , prepared . They were baring their teeth . The frigate was named the Montral . It was the lengdi of two city blocks and painted warship gray , packed with twodozen torpedoes and nearly 250 people . There were sailors , Vandoos , and Mounties . There were Canadian wireservice reporters and photographers from at least two in-flight magazines . There were Inuit dignitaries and observen from Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated , the pseudo-governmental Inuit corporation that had negotiated die 1999 creation of its people 's own 800,000-square-mile territory , Nunavut . Our cruise speed was 15.5 knots . Our fuel stores were at 125 percent . With diesel taking the place of water in the auxiliary tanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steaming north , farther north than the Canadian Navy had gone in decades . Prime Minister Stephen Harper himself had made the long journey to Iqaluit , the former U.S. military base that is now the capital of Nunavut , to kick off the operation . In the previous months he had sparred publicly with the American ambassador over ownership of the Northwest Passage , the storied , still mostly frozen shipping route from the Pacific to the Atlantic across the top of die continent . The military had been referring to the passage as the Canadian Internal Waters , and Harper had promised to build new heavy icebreakers , a new Arctic warfare and training center , a new Arctic deepwater port , and a new Arctic network of undersea sensors and aerial drones . Now , as the north melted and Arctic shipping promised to become viable well before the century was up , he was putting boots on the ice . There had been sovereignty operations before , including Exercise Narwhal Ranger in 2002 and Operation Nunalivut ( Inuktitut for " the land is ours " ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian troops helicoptered to Hans Island - a kidneyshaped , half-square-mile rock near Greenland claimed by both Denmark and Canada - and planted a supposedly windproof steel flag and flagpole that the wind toppled almost immediately . They also confiscated a Danish flag , which the government then delivered to Denmark 's ambassador in Ottawa . Despite assurances by a spokesman diat Danish pastries would still be served in the cafeteria of Canada 's foreign affairs ministry , Denmark nearly sent a warship to Hans in retaliation . Today 's was the largest such operation to date , however , and it was occurring on the hundredth anniversary of the Northwest Passage 's first crossing ( which was by a Norwegian , though no one dwelled on that ) . Its name was Operation Lancaster , and its stated goal was to " project a credible size military force over a broad area of the Eastern Arctic . " It would last twelve days in all . The Montral would lead a flotilla of two navy warships and two coast guard icebreakers into Lancaster Sound , the eastern entrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzed with Aurora surveillance planes and Griffon helicopters . Meanwhile , the Vandoos - accompanied by Inuit reservists , there to ensure rhat no one was eaten by polar bears - would take the smaller ships to shore and set up observation posts on both sides of the sound . To the north , on rocky Devon Island , would be Observation Post 1 . To the south , on glaciated Bylot Island and the adjacent Borden Peninsula , would be Observation Posts 2 and 3 . The troops would hold the high ground for most of a week , scanning the Northwest Passage for invaders . But all of this would be preceded by a bold display of Canadian resolve : a mock interdiction . After watching the machine guns fire and the Maple Leaf flag flutter , I strolled up to the bridge and stood next to the Montreal 's head officer , Commander Paul Dempsey . He and his crew had donned green helmets and green flak jackets . The radio crackled , and a Canadian approximation of the voice of a California surfer filled the bridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in actuality was the Goose Bay , a 180-foot Canadian coastal-defense vessel that the war gamers had decided would be a rogue " American " merchant ship . The Killer Bee was four miles away in the fog , sailing a course that would intersect with ours in an estimated fourteen minutes , forty-two seconds . It would not say where it was going . It would not say what was in its hold . " Merchant vessel Killer Bee , what is your cargo ? " our radioman asked . " This is Warship 336 . Again , what is your cargo ? " The Killer Bee 's answers were brief , rude , American in their tone save for the occasional slipup : " We 're aboot forty miles off the coast , which constitutes international waters . Are you sure you have the authority to be questioning me out here ? Can you just tell me again why I 'm being asked these questions ? You guys are the almighty Canadian government , so I 'm sure you can access this sort of information somewhere else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lancaster , Christine Whitecross , asking for clearance to send over a boarding party and , if necessary , to initiate " disabling fire . " The sailors on the bridge peered into the mist off our port side . We informed the Killer Bee that we would be boarding it , and its captain replied that he would n't be " too down with that . " The engine churned . We began to close die gap : 700 yards , 600 yards , 500 yards . The ship appeared , and we aimed our 50-caliber machine gun at it . " Bullying your way around die ocean is not a way to foster cooperation between our two countries , " the voice told us . Dempsey took over the radio , commanded the Killer Bee to remove all personnel from its top decks , and directed a barrage of tracer fire 1,000 yards off its bow . The smell of gunpowder wafted through the bridge . The next barrage was 500 yards off the bow . Finally , our 57millimeter cannon swiveled toward the Killer Bee . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , and then , seconds later , a sixth round . The ocean in front of the Killer Bee erupted . Its captain relented . " I thought Canada was a nation of peacekeepers , " whined the faux-American . For the next 500 miles , we saw only water and fog and an occasional glimpse of the chutes and pinnacles of Baffin Island 's peaks . It was n't until 10:00 A.M. on the operation 's fourth day that a much-awaited announcement came over the loudspeaker : icebergs ahead . We rushed to the portside deck where the officers normally gathered to smoke . We were at seventytwo degrees north , and there were three of them : two- and three-hundred-foot giants that towered over the frigate . The icebergs ' walls were riven by small waterfalls , and chunks of ice were falling off into the sea . The bergs were drifting south toward the Atlantic , bound for warmer waters where they would soon melt into nothing . The Vandoos leaned over the railing and snapped photos . This was the year that droughtcrazed camels rampaged through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piers in New York City 's Hudson River , and the Netherlands announced that its famous Elfstedentocht ice-skating race might have to be postponed forever . Armadillos reached northeast Arkansas . Wolves ate dogs in Alaska . Fire consumed 50 million acres of Siberia . Greenland lost a hundred gigatons of ice . The Inuit got air-conditioning units . The polar bear lurched toward die endangered-species list . India 's Ghoramara Island was mostly lost to the Bay of Bengal , Papua New Guinea 's Malasiga village was mostly lost to the Solomon Sea , and Alaska 's Shishmaref village decided to evacuate before being lost to the Chukchi Sea . Canadian scientists reported that the forty-square-mile Ayles ice shelf had broken off Ellesmere Island and formed a rapidly melting island of its own . A European satellite showed a temporary crack in the ice pack leading from northern Russia all the way to the North Pole . The National Oceanic &; Atmospheric Administration announced that last winter was the warmest since it began keeping records , which was in 1880 . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change announced that eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . This was the year that we began to believe in global wanning - not in die abstract science of the prospect , which most people could already passively accept , but in the fact that there was money in it , power to be won and lost , scraps to tussle over , profit to be wrung from crisis . We stopped wondering wherher climate change was real and started grappling with the consequences . In April the issue of global warming went before the United Nations Security Council . The discussion was led by Britain , which houses its climate-change office , the Hadley Centre , in its Ministry of Defence , and which had recently asked its chief economist , Sir Nicholas Stern , to conduct a review of global warming 's likely effects on world markets . Stern 's findings were dire : The cost of unchecked greenhouse-gas emissions will be the equivalent of losing 5 percent or more of global GDP a year , every year , forever . We are on the brink of an upheaval on die scale of the two world wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a 9 to 14 percent rise in exposure to malaria by around 2050 , a 5 to 10 percent drop in crop yields , and up to 250 million more people affected by drought . Nearly 200 million South and East Asians will be threatened by sea-level rises resulting from collapsing ice sheets , and nearly a trillion dollars of regional GDP could be lost . In South America maize production will fall by 15 percent in fifty years and die desiccating Amazon will be pushed toward collapse , its forest replaced by savanna . " What makes wars start ? " British foreign minister Margaret Beckett asked the Security Council . " Fights over water . Changing patterns of rainfall . Fights over food production , land use . " But the future did not seem universally dark . At the margins of the crisis , some saw opportunity , especially in the wealthy nations that are causing climate change in the first place . In the short term in Europe , Russia , Canada , and America , rain will still fall , growing seasons will extend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soybean crops will be bolstered by the " carbon-dioxide fertilization " effect : The higher the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide , which is a key building block for plant growth , the higher the yields . Farther north , in the Arctic , the " ice albedo feedback " effect - the fact that sea ice , which reflects 85 to 90 percent of solar radiation , melts to become seawater , which absorbs all but 10 percent - is expected to keep temperatures climbing at twice the current global rate . This will speed up the melt , and the melt may speed up northern economies . More than a fifth of the world 's undiscovered oil and liquid gas - 175 billion barrels , according to one estimate - is thought to be hiding in the Arctic . The less ice there is , the more oil there is within reach . Meanwhile , the Northwest Passage , along with its counterpart across the top of Russia , the Northeast Passage , could someday cut 5,000 miles out of the shipping route between northern Europe and East Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ships too large for the Panama or Suez Canal , and a thousand dollars out of the cost- $1,500- of sending a container to Japan . The $49 million grossed by Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth may have been global warming 's first true financial windfall , but a new mentality is taking hold . Reports by Citigroup , UBS , and Lehman Brothers have recently advised investors on how to wring a buck out of global tailspin . Citigroup 's report , " Climatic Consequences : Investment Implications of a Changing Climate , " released in January , is particularly helpful . It highlights investment opportunities at seventy-four companies in twenty-one industries in eighteen countries , including Aguas de Barcelona ( drought-afflicted Spain 's " leader in water supply " ) , Monsanto ( drought-resistant crops ) , and John Deere ( more tractors needed in America as drought wipes out Australia 's wheat exports ) . It shows a graph of the six top natural-gas-producing countries in the world . Four of them - Russia , the United States , Canada , and Norway - are Arctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll call Sergeant Strong , a tall Canadian in his forties who had a thick brown mustache and a runner 's build and wore a dark beret with a gold crest . He had killed people in the Balkans , Afghanistan , and places he would not specify , and every time I pulled out my camera , he stepped out of view . He did not want me to use his real name . He was a patriot and a lifelong soldier , and recently he 'd become a reporter for Canadian Army News . He roamed the ship with a pair of Nikons slung from his shoulders . We first met on the back deck , near the helicopter hangar , and he immediately asked who I thought owned the Northwest Passage . I said I was n't sure . " It 's ours , " he told me . " It 's fucking ours . " Then he shared his solution for the territorial dispute over Hans Island . " We should just nuke Denmark , " he said . He was kidding , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more typically Canadian , and it revealed him as a believer in the basic boots-on-the-ice premise of Operation Lancaster . " Just put a trailer on the island , " he said . " Two guys , two months at a time . Give them TVs and VCRs . And guess what : Problem solved . " The sergeant had a partner , Master Corporal Bradley , a giant videographer with whatever the opposite of a Napoleon complex is . Bradley 's mustache was gray and waxed into dueling barbs , and he wore noise-canceling headphones even when he was n't filming . He walked like a hunchback through the bowels of the Montral , constantly hitting his head on doorways . The three of us , it turned out , would be part of the landing team forming Observation Post 1 on Devon Island . We would be joining eight Vandoos and four Inuit - reservists outfitted with red cotton hoodies and known as Canadian Rangera - to go ashore at Dundas Harbor , a shallow fjord where the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had manned its own outpost in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to selfinflicted gunshots to the head : the first , a suicide ; the second , an apparent walrus-hunting mishap . Two days before our " insertion , " which is what everyone insisted on calling our mission to Devon , we were allowed to take a tour of the Montreal 's operations room - a cave of damp air lit only by radar and sonar screens and low red lights . Inside we met the ship 's underwater-warfare officer . " Could you detect a passing submarine ? " I asked . He could not . The ship could n't drop sonar rays in the water without NATO permission . " They 'd wonder why we were asking , " he said . " And if we did detect something we 'd say , " Hey , we found your sub , " and the Americans would say , " No you did n't , " and we 'd say , " Yes we did . " It 's a touchy subject . " I asked about the relative size of the two navies . " The Americans , jeez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have 60,000 people working in Norfolk alone . On one base . That 's as many as we have in our entire armed forces . They have massive fleets . Massive . And we 're obviously , you know , small . " Our tour guide interjected : " But we can punch above our weight class . " The officer agreed . " Yeah , we punch above our weight class . " One deck below the ops room was the lower-ranks mess , and I went there one afternoon to hear Commissioner Ann Meekitjuk Hanson , the formal head of Nunavut , address the troops . She told them about her childhood speaking only Inuktitut , her forced relocation to Toronto for schooling , and her Canadianized life in journalism and politics . " I have to disabuse southerners of their igloo notions , " she said , " and explain that there 's more to us than drumming and throat singing . " A sailor named Roberts , one of perhaps five black people on the entire ship , asked how climate change was affecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting noticeably later , and that they were having difficulties forecasting weather and ice conditions ; now there were only six seasons rather than the traditional eight . She showed us slides of her homeland and put a cassette into a boom box to play some throat-singing music for us . After Commissioner Hanson finished explaining how her culture was being wiped out , I walked down the hall and found Sergeant Strong in our own mess , once again promoting his plan for Hans Island . " It could be something as simple as putting a couple of guys up there with a trailer , " he told a reporter from one of the in-flight magazines . " How much would that cost ? The problem would just go away . " Last October , I traveled to Vancouver to meet Michael Byers , the former director of Duke University 's Canadian Studies Program and an expert on Canadian security and sovereignty . Byers , who is a young-looking forty years old and has two days ' worth of beard every day , had recently returned home , surrendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst of patriotism . He had taken a position at the University of British Columbia , and I was invited to sit in on his graduate seminar on climate change , a ten-person class held in a corner room with tall windows looking out on tall fir trees . When I walked in fifteen minutes late , a lanky student named Ryder McKeown was delivering a PowerPoint presentation called " Climate Change and National Security . " He wore jeans and glasses and Puma sneakers that happened to be red , white , and blue . " Given the choice between starving and raiding , " one of McKeown 's slides read , " people raid . " He was n't talking about refugees from the tropics - at least not just them . The United States has a worsening water shortage , he said , and Canada has 20 percent of the world 's freshwater . He described " fantastic schemes " to export it across the border in bulk , including one proposal to divert Canadian rivers to run southward rather than northward . In another plan , fjords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with freshwater ; tankers would arrive , top up , and chug south to Los Angeles . " We have it , " he said . " They want it . " Byers jumped in . " We are talking about 300 million people with the world 's largest military and with a desperate need for water , " he said , " and to some degree the constraints of international law will fade into the background . But luckily water conservation is much cheaper than enormous engineering projects . They 'll find it hard to justify the expense . " The discussion turned to the Northwest Passage , where the United States has twice enraged Canadian nationalists by sending ships through without asking permission . The 1969 voyage of the S.S. Manhattan , an icestrengthened supertanker that tested the frozen route 's viability for transporting North Slope oil ( the verdict : not yet ) , led to 1970 legislation in the Canadian Parliament that asserted Ottawa 's right to control Arctic traffic , which in turn led to failed eleventh-hour maneuvering to forestall the new law by Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaliatory cut in U.S. imports of Canadian oil . The 1985 crossing of the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Sea led to more uproar and the negotiation of an informal " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy : Before making any transits of the passage , the Coast Guard now notifies Canada ( without exactly asking ) ; Canada agrees never to tell its neighbor no . As the ice melts and the world 's oil deposits dry up , it 's a policy few believe will hold . American submarines already use the passage to travel between the Atlantic and the Pacific , and I had heard unprovable tales of Inuit hunters mistaking those subs for whales and shooting at them , only to have their bullets bounce off . " We are talking about moving from a country that , in practical terms , had two coastlines , to one that now has three coastlines , " Byers said . " And we 're being told that our new third coastline is n't subject to full Canadian jurisdiction - that it 's the wild , wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smuggling , illegal immigration , and environmental damage could go unchecked if Canada did n't take control . McKeown suggested there was a deeper threat as well . As divisive as the Northwest Passage may be , he said , Canada and the United States are drawn together in times of crisis - not pulled apart . He rattled off examples of cross-border cooperation : the Permanent Joint Board on Defense in 1940 , NATO in 1948 , NORAD in 1958 , the Smart Border Declaration in 2001 . In the mid-1950s , the Distant Early Warning Line - fifty-eight Soviet-facing radar posts - was built with mostly American money on mostly Canadian land . If climate change is truly as disruptive as both world wars , might Canada be drawn into an inescapable embrace with America ? McKeown was running out of time , so he raced through his last slides , laying out a climate-change scenario designed to " stretch our way of thinking " : First , rising seas flood Bangladesh , Mumbai , and Shanghai . Refugee applications then flood Canada . A terrorist group based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders . In retaliation , Canada ceases water exports . But then , as immigrants sneak in from aie Arctic and Russian and Chinese subs cruise the Northwest Passage , Canada asks for America 's help . It offers unfettered access to its resources in return for security . " Canada , " McKeown concluded , " remains an independent country in name only . " Byers let that sink in . " If we 're in a Mad Max world , when things are increasingly dangerous and it 's survival of the fittest , " he said , " it 's not implausible to argue that our future is bound to the United States . " He was playing devil 's advocate . It worked . The class erupted . " Integration is a slippery slope , " said McKeown . A student on the far side of the room agreed . " We could lose our central-banking independence , our monetary independence , our social democratic Canadianism , " he said . " Our sovereignty is us , right ? Without it we lose independent policy all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rico ? " Byers asked . " Is it part of the United States G The students answered that it was a commonwealth , a protectorate . " They 're American citizens - sort of - but they ca n't vote , " one said . " They do n't have minimumwage standards , " said another . " There are a lot of people who support greater integration with the United States , " Byers concluded , " and they 're all under the assumption that we would become the next California - that we would become a state . But someone once told me that we Canadians need to pay more attention to Puerto Rico . " A student sitting across from me spoke up . " They would definitely never give us the vote , " he said . " They do n't want thirty million more Democrats . " The class burst into laughter , but it was short-lived . " The United States is no longer a democracy at the federal level , " someone said , " and I do n't want to see us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is , What are our alternatives ? I think an alliance with Europe would make a lot of sense for us . " I was reminded of a Canadian radio contest some years ago in which listeners were challenged to come up with a national slogan equivalent to " as American as apple pie . " The winning entry : " As Canadian as possible under the circumstances . " Our insertion onto Devon Island began with a frenzy of packing and mapreading and sorting through food rations in the helicopter hangar . A rope ladder was soon thrown over the side of the Montral , and we put on black life jackets and climbed down to a Zodiac raft that was pitching on six-foot seas . The Vandoos ' sergeant , Dany Saleh , went first . The surprisingly graceful Bradley , all 300 or so pounds of him , came last . We filled the front of the Zodiac with rucksacks and ration packs and weapons , and then we zipped across the ocean until the Moncton , a small warship just shorter than a hockey rink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the haze . We scaled its ladder and formed a bucket brigade to unload the gear . The Moncton was homey - its crew consisted of forty reservists - and so tight on space that the Vandoos had to set up cots in the hallways . Most of its sailors were as new to the Arctic as we were . I 'd known Devon Island only as the site of NASA 's Mars on Earth project , in which investigators attempt to live on a rocky , frigid , arid analogue to the Red Planet , and I was surprised by its beauty when we approached the next day . It loomed large even from thirty miles out , its glaciers pouring down from desolate 3,000-foot peaks . The fog was gone , the sun was high , and icebergs kept floating past . The water was milky , glacial . An Aurora surveillance plane appeared and made a triple pass above us , plumes of smoke trailing behind its four props . We sailed in from the east , and as we turned the corner into the fjord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west : the Russian-flagged , Australian-chartered , 6,600-ton Akademik loffe . It was a tour boat . I recognized it from the watchman 's picture book , in which its photo was sandwiched between images of Danish warships and surveillance aircraft . The loffe 's ice pilot radioed over . " Good afternoon , Warship 708 , this is the Akademik loffe . We are a small passenger ship , an expedition ship . We have many Canadians - myself included - onboard . " His voice had a slight tremor to it . " It looks like you 'll be into Dundas Harbor before us , so we 'll be sure to stay out of your way . " The officers on the Moncton snickered and rolled their eyes , pleased at the fear they generated . " You 're damn right , " one said . " I ca n't believe he called us before we called him , " said another . It was reminiscent of the confrontation with the Killer Bee , only this time with a real , albeit Canadian , foe . Our warship surged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the fjord . We then slowed to a crawl . Our fifty-year-old charts , it turned out , could n't tell us how deep the harbor was , and the captain was worried that we might run aground . We took depth soundings and peered into the silty water . The charts said it was thirty feet deep . Our sonar said it was more than two hundred . Best to stay put . We dropped anchor a mile offshore and began the slow process of readying the Zodiacs . The Akademik loffe steamed past us and anchored a half-mile closer . As Sergeant Saleh and others put on orange survival suits and the crew of the Moncton put on baby-blue helmets , the loffe put boats in the water . " They 're beating us ! " someone yelled . A hundred tourists made it to shore before our dozen soldiers were off the ship . The Canadian Forces reached the narrow , rocky beach just as the loffe ' s tourists were finishing their stroll . The tourists were white-haired and frail and dressed in matching blue-and-yellow Gore-Tex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the vast , empty Arctic . Cameras and binoculars hung from their necks . They seemed confused . The Vandoos shouldered their hundred-pound packs and struggled mightily up the beach , grunting , assault rifles in hand . They proceeded across the soggy tundra , their boots sinking into the mud with every step . One of the guides from the loffe , a man from Seattle with a bushy beard and a brown fedora , interrupted this long march to remind us to " leave no trace " - Devon 's environment was fragile . Sergeant Strong looked at the American . " A lot of us have spent a lot of time in the north , " he said . " We 're actually here to protect it . " A month after visiting Michael Byers 's class , I decided to travel to Washington , D.C. , to see what Canada was so afraid of . I found a capital that was awakening to the security risks posed by global warming , and also awakening , perhaps , to the idea that northern riches could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one really seemed to think that Canada would get in our way . No one really seemed to think that it would come to blows . No one really seemed to think about Canada at all . In the United States , studies linking global warming and security date at least to 2003 , when futurist Peter Schwartz released a groundbreaking report commissioned by the Pentagon , " An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National Security . " In 2004 , the National Intelligence Council included global warming in its Global Briefing , a twice-a-decade look at future flashpoints . In early March of this year , Schwartz released a second report for an unnamed agency , and three days later a special committee on global warming was formed in the House . The Senate 's Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act - legislation that would require the sixteen main intelligence agencies to produce a National Intelligence Estimate on the topic - was introduced later that month . The study " National Security and the Threat of Climate Change , " produced by eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naval Analyses , was released a few weeks later . The Pentagon 's fears , Schwartz told me , could be boiled down to a single word : Mogadishu . " Massive drought led to famine , which led to the collapse of Somalia , which led to the U.N . intervention , which led to the U.S. intervention , which led to a military disaster , " he said . " They see a string of Mogadishus rolling off into the future . " The only Arctic link I dug up was an outdated website from an April 2001 Navy symposium , " Naval Operations in an Ice-Free Arctic . " In a bakery on the west side of Farragut Square , I met Dennis Conlon , the former head of the Office of Naval Research 's Arctic program and the organizer of the symposium . He told me that the fifty participants - military officers , civilian ice captains , scientists - had determined that sonar function would improve as the ice melted but that charts and GPS coverage would fall short , and that submarines would need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts : a fight over fishing rights in the Chuckchi Sea , a special-operations strike against " environmental terrorists " who had seized oil facilities in the Svalbard Archipelago , a " Freedom of Navigation Operation " to loosen Russia 's grip on the Northeast Passage , which experts believe will become ice-free decades before the Northwest Passage . Yet by the time the symposium 's report was ready , the Pentagon and the World Trade Center had been hit , and its findings were lost in the fog of 9/11 . " We could n't even brief the thing , " Conlon said . He mentioned that he drives a Prius these days . He is also out of a job . The Navy , which spent in the neighborhood of $30 million a year on polar research in the midNineties - when fears of a Soviet attack from the north were still fresh - phased out its Arctic program in 2003 . But , Conlon told me , there was good news : a follow-up symposium would take place this summer . In Washington , Canada experts were hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's status as a strategic non-entity . I lunched with two of the few - David Biette of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and Christopher Sands of the Center for Strategic and International Studies - on back-to-back days , and I listened as each framed the dispute over the Northwest Passage as a dispute over freedom of navigation everywhere . The United States , it turns out , does not disagree that the Northwest Passage runs through Canadian waters . Its claim is that the passage is an international strait like Malacca , Gibraltar , Bab-elMandeb , the Dardanelles , and the Bosporus - a waterway that should be open to container ships and oil tankers from all nations . The European Union shares America 's interpretation , and China - another country with much to gain from an open passage - recently signaled its thoughts when its 550-foot icebreaker Snow Dragon appeared in the Arctic and the captain nonchalantly landed passengers at the Canadian settlement of Tuktoyaktuk . " This is n't just to stick it to Canada , " Biette said . " This is a global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada because he was too busy discussing protection of Canada . Although he did not use the precise phrase , he suggested that the U.S. presence in the north was a kind of modern white man 's burden .

" The Canadians are n't going to do it , the Mexicans are n't going to do it , and we ca n't do much to stop them from being free riders . " I went to American University , where I met with Robert Pastor , a professor and longtime adviser to Democratic presidential candidates who is often denounced by Canadian nationalists for advocating what he calls the North American Community : a sort of supersized NAFTA , this continent 's answer to the European Union . Shared security , he told me , would be part of the deal - the borders between Canada , the United States , and Mexico would open , and the one surrounding all three would be beefed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that we knock down all trade barriers and together fill our wallets with " ameros .

Insofar as it was looking at all , it was to see how much money it could make : an invasion by the wealthy for the wealthy that had little to do with survival . After four days in Washington , I finally visited the Canadian Embassy to meet Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Martin , the affable man behind the website CanadianAUy.com , which is designed to remind Americans how much their neighbor is and wants to be their friend . The embassy sits directly between Congress and the White House . " Great place for a peacekeeper , eh ? " Martin said . He acknowledged the strained political ties between America and Canada since his country declined to join the Coalition of the Willing in Iraq , but he assured me that our economic ties were as strong as ever . Canada is the biggest trade partner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our natural-gas imports . It supplies us with more oil than any other country . " Americans have lights on in their homes because of Canadian energy , " he said , " and millions of you have jobs thanks to Canadian trade . Ontario alone does more business with the United States than all of Japan . " I walked out of the embassy with a foldup map of Canada 's resources for hire-the uranium we could mine from Saskatchewan if we need it , the oil sands in Alberta , the turbot fishery in Nunavut , the hydroelectric complexes in Quebec . Martin was speaking our language . Our campsite on Devon Island was a flat patch of high ground at the base of a reddish hill of scree . In front of us was the Northwest Passage ; to our side was the fjord that was Dundas Harbor ; and below us , a few hundred yards away , were the weather-beaten wooden buildings of the abandoned Mountie post . There were a few bergy bits in the bay , a few patches of yellow grass around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vandoos ' lineup of A-frame tents , which had been set up one next to another in a very military row . Our crew of Inuit Rangers , two men and two women who had arrived earlier by helicopter , were zipped inside a nearby dome tent , playing cards . They kept bursting into laughter because one of them kept farting . I was wedged in my own green tent along with Sergeant Strong and Master Corporal Bradley , who had been told , incorrectly , that they would be provided shelter . There was little to do . The first evening , Saleh , the Vandoos ' sergeant , spent hours trying to make contact with the Moncton and the two observation posts across the sound . Sergeant Saleh received mostly static , even after his men restrung the wire antenna a few times . " Eeny stay-shun , eeny stay-shun ? " he called into the void . " Thees ees Thirtee-One-Bravo . . . Say ageen ? Say ageen ? Say ageen ? " One of the Inuit , who , unlike the Quebecer , had learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , with scarcely better luck . Four of the Vandoos , apparently bored , ran off and climbed the hill behind camp , returning only after their superiors yelled at them . I counted icebergs . There were fifteen in sight , including two ship-size giants and two halves of another iceberg that the Rangers had watched break apart earlier that day . The ice was moving , but so slowly that you had to look away for a moment to detect any change . The sun tried but never really set . Night at seventy-four degrees north , if you could call it night , was a three-hour period of darker-than-normal gray . We learned that the electric fence we 'd been allotted to fend off polar bears did n't work . Our bear protection consisted of two .303 shotguns and four Inuit , so the Rangers ' sergeant had the entire camp huddle around his laptop to watch a bear-safety DVD . Advice : Poking it in the eyes wo n't work . He said that the .303 's first three rounds would be " bear bangers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slug of lead . Under Canadian law , only Inuit were allowed to kill polar bears , and there were no exceptions . But we should all be ready to use the lead slug if it became a matter of life or death . We should aim for the bear 's neck or just below its shoulder , where we would have a chance at piercing its heart . More tourists invaded on the second morning-ninety-two of them , all in matching yellow Gore-Tex jackets-and streamed toward our tents . " It looks like the march of the penguins , eh ? " said Sergeant Strong . An old woman with a beret and a tiny backpack arrived and fixed her gaze on him . " Who are you ? " she asked . " Who are youl " asked the sergeant . " I 'm from the boat , " she said . She was an American from Chicago . Her friend , who was Portuguese but lived near Canada in upstate New York , joined us . The conversation turned to sovereignty . " The Americans are essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's oil up here , they 'll be here . That 's what all these wars are about . " She mentioned Hans Island , and Sergeant Strong lit up . " I think the simple solution fot Hans Island is to just put someone there , " he said . " You 've just got to keep people there year-round . " The woman made a face . " But then the Danes would just send someone there too , " she replied . The pair walked off , and we stood there in camp , our hands in our pockets . " That woman has an opinion about everything , " the sergeant said . " She was way out of whack , " Bradley said . " It 's just silly to talk about a fight over oil . We 're producing so much and sending so much south that you guys do n't need to come up here and take it - we 're selling it to you freely . " We watched the tourists return to their ship in a flotilla of Zodiacs . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed his rifle and shot a three-foot-long Arctic hare - a bullet between the eyes from 200 yards away . He 'd spied it earlier but had n't wanted to scare our visitors . He skinned it and chopped it into chunks and left it on top of a plastic bag in the middle of camp , where it began to dry in the sun . To the extent that America has had an Arctic policy since the Cold War , it is the doing of George Newton , a mustachioed former nuclear-submarine captain who spent fourteen years on the U.S. Arctic Research Commission , many of them as its chairman . When he and I met in Washington , he had just stepped down , and we sat in what I took to be his former office . I hoped he could tell me what we were really after in the north . He had large wire-rimmed glasses and spoke in emphatic tones , downing cup after cup of water as we talked . I asked him first about the Northwest Passage . " Why should we be the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Should n't Japan , which has a large fleet , take the lead ? Or Maersk , the big shipping company in Denmark ? Should n't Denmatk be in on this ? " Newton explained that the right of " innocent passage " through active straits is also enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - the so-called Constitution of the Oceans , a treaty signed by 155 countries as of July . ( The United States , despite having drafted much of the law in the 1970s , is not yet among them . ) But he granted that legal arguments on both sides are complicated by the ice : The passage is frozen , so it 's difficult to call it an active strait . And it 's equally difficult to say it will never become one . The treaty 's language regarding ice-covered areas hurts the U.S. position as much as the language regarding international straits helps it . Still , Newton was confident that the rhetoric could be toned down , that we could all act like adults about this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratification of the Law of the Sea treaty had been the Arctic Research Commission 's greatest goal under Newton , and it remains its greatest goal today . This has hardly anything to do with the Northwest Passage , though , and almost everything to do with oil . The treaty , which establishes navigational rules and sets forth nations ' rights to the fish and minerals 200 nautical miles off their coastlines , also allows them to claim further territory based on the undersea extent of their continental shelves . This latter provision , Article 76 of the Law of the Sea , will allow America to get its share of polar oil . It is the rule under which the five nations with Arctic Ocean frontage- Canada , Denmark , Norway , Russia , and the United States - will carve up the Arctic . It is the terms of engagement for the last great imperial partition . The Law of the Sea turns the world , especially the top of the world , into a different place . In terms of sea it could someday own , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its island holdings surrounded by an oversize doughnut of sovereign waters , would grow by 4.1 million square miles . It would surpass China , Canada , and Russia , with their own expanded holdings , to become the wotld 's largest country . The key to all of this is proving how far your landmass extends undersea , a process that requires collecting detailed bathymetric and seismic data . These findings inevitably would be contested , but the United States could claim an estimated $1.3 trillion worth of resources , some $650 billion in petroleum in the Alaskan shelf alone . An oilman , no matter how wary of international agreements , should love this law , and President Bush has said as recently as mid-May that he intends to sign it despite conservative opposition . " Our need for oil is not going to go away , " Newton said . " We 're going to need every bit we can get our hands on . Even if we do n't use as much in cars and trucks , we 're going to need plastics , and fertilizers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more oil that 's tied to us directly , the more that comes in a pipeline or in a short trip in U.S. waters , the better off we are . " Canada 's Arctic archipelago , he said , was the next " oil elephant , " and that 's not all : An estimated 2 1 billion tons of coal sit on Ellesmere Island , and methane bubbles up everywhere through the Arctic 's melting permafrost . Methane , as a greenhouse gas , is at least twenty times more damaging than carbon dioxide . On the upside , it has energy potential . Inuit hunters already poke holes in the ground and light them for warmth . Newton had watched Russia - which recently announced plans for a special army to guard oil rigs and pipelines - get rich off its northern petroleum fields . " Look at how that country is digging itself out of a quagmire , " he said . " They 're getting up , flexing their muscles , feeling like big boys - people gon na pay respect . That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia 's Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper printed a large map showing a Russian flag flying over the North Pole and a supposed new addition to the nation 's territorial holdings : 460,000 square miles of Arctic Ocean . Russia 's first Article 76 claim to the pole , in 2001 , was rejected for lack of data , but a team of scientists had returned from a six-week expedition by nucleat icebreaker saying that they had gotten what they needed . The 1,100-mile-long Lomonosov Ridge , an underwater mountain range that bisects the Arc- tic - along with the region 's 10 billion tons of gas and oil reserves - would be Russia 's , they said . Although the United Nations has yet to evaluate the claim , Russia celebrated . It was a reminder rhat our allies , no matter how many times we invite them to Kennebunkport , are n't waiting for America to sign the Law of the Sea . The race is already on . Canada signed the treaty in 2003 , Denmark in 2004 . Despite remaining tensions over Hans Island dustups such as Exercise Frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that the Lomonosov Ridge is in fact connected to Canada 's Ellesmere Island and Denmark 's Greenland . Operating from the Canadian military-intelligence outpost of Alert at eighty-two degrees north , their scientists use helicopters and ski planes to lay networks of sensors : a seismometer every kilometer , packs of explosives every fifteen kilometers . Canada is expected to gain 310,000 square miles , Denmark 62,000 square miles - an area nearly four times the size of Denmark itself . As for Norway , it made its Article 76 submission late last year . Wielding bathymetry collected by its petroleum directorate , it claimed 96,000 square miles of ocean , and it reserved the right to claim more later . The United States , meanwhile , has been quietly scanning the Arctic seabed with multi-beam sonar since 2003 . The effort , led by Larry Mayer of the University of New Hampshire , is publicly known . What has n't been public is the State Department-led apparatus behind it . The working group that also involves the Coast Guard , Navy , and Minerals Management Service ramped up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Bush 's 2008 budget to fund the program . Subgroups have formed . Submarines and new icebreakers have been discussed . A mapping strategy has been laid out . " A lot of seismic work will be necessary , " a senior State Department official told me . For an entire monrh this summer , the Healy , the United States ' one fully operational icebreaker , which costs $100,000 a day to operate and is shared by the entire science community , will be dedicated to Mayer 's bathymetry work . Treaty or no , the last piece of the pie is being filled in . Within a decade , five nations could own all of the Arctic Ocean save for two small holes of water too deep to be claimed , and oil exploration - helped along by the coinciding meltdown of the ice cap - could lead to a true oil boom . At the observation post later that second day , the Montral appeared in the sound , with the smaller Moncton trailing it like a baby elephant . They floated past . We observed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Frenchaccented English : " Are you lonesome tonight ? Do you miss me tonight ? Are you sorry we drifted apart ? " The Inuit stared at him . " Elvees , " he said . " You du n no Elvees ? " Later , he led a handful of soldiers on an unsuccessful fishing expedition . When they returned , they stripped and dove into the Arctic Ocean , staying in long enough to wash their hair with a bottle of Pert Plus shampoo . We combed through the rations - unwanted items got thrown in together in a cardboard box - and I goaded Sergeant Strong about the previous day 's fedora-wearing American , an invader who dared tell Canadians how to treat Canadian soil . The sergeant was too Canadian to enjoy the irony . " That 's okay , " he said . " He was right . We do need to be careful about the environment up here . " His earnestness affected me . It will be a shame when the tankers start to spill their oil up here . Crude gets trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and chemical dispersants fail in cold temperatures ; one of the most successful cleanup methods has been to simply light the oil on fire and watch it burn away - just what an already collapsing ecosystem needs . The radio started working , and from across the sound we heard accounts of what had happened to the other observation posts . The men and women of Observation Post 2 had landed in heavy seas - the navy boatmen had ignored the Rangers ' recommendation to use an easier beach - and two Zodiacs were swamped by waves . The soldiers had to use their helmets to bail out the boats . Some returned to the Montral just to get warm , while the rest made a rough camp at the bottom of a steep slope . In the morning they learned that their goal , an abandoned scientific research station , was still six kilometers away . They had to be flown there in helicopters . They arrived to find one of the Air Force 's Twin Otters , which was meant to be running support , stuck in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a signal and their radio barely worked . At Observation Post 3 , troops were almost eaten by a polar bear . Waiting for a helicopter lift , they had taken down theit bear fence and removed the ammunition from their shotguns , standard procedure before a flight . The bear was slinking up a ravine , and it was fifty yards away when the helicopter pilot spotted it . He had to divebomb it with the chopper to scare it off . Compared with the monotony of Devon , this all sounded rather appealing . But it was our job to observe , and that we did . It was our job to be a presence , and that we were . A fog rolled in , and the world became spectral and gray . When it had passed , Sergeant Strong and I explored the Mountie outpost together . The front door was coated with faded red paint . Inside we found a sewing machine , a rusted fuel drum , and a wooden table stacked with books : Two Black Sheep , The Astounding Crime on Torrington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , someone had posted an inventory from the summer of 1945 : two dog corrals ; one flagpole , one fire shovel , one kitchen table , four kitchen chairs , one coal heater , one forty-five-gallon water barrel , two blubber tanks . The graves of the two Mounties who died here were just up the hill . " If I had a warm cabin to come back to , " the setgeant said , " I could do it . 1 could do a winter here . " We had three days to go . We built a fire . We stayed up later and later . The hours passed without tick marks . One night , I stood alone outside my tent , looking out at the sun that never set . The two youngest Vandoos - a sixteen-year-old and a seventeen-yearold - had been given the first watch . I saw one take out his video camera and start walking around the tundra , filming very little . His partner sat facing the Northwest Passage , raising his rifle and pointing it into space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .
