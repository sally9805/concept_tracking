Good evening . So pleased you could join us . No , do n't bother with the door , I can assure you it 's securely locked . The windows too . Really , it 's quite useless to struggle . Let 's try to conduct ourselves in a civilized fashion , shall we ? Sherry ? We 're here to discuss mystery novels . As we both know , there are ominously looming mountains of them , and you do n't want to waste your precious beach reading time with books that are doomed to bore , do you ? Here instead are six of this summer 's most tightly wound , delicately nuanced and deviously irresistible . Settle in and prepare to enjoy yourself . I 'm afraid escape is quite impossible . <P>  --  THE WINTER QUEEN , by Boris Akunin ( Random House ; 244 pages ) <P> On a warm spring morning in 1876 , A well-dressed young man accosts a pretty young woman out walking with her governess in a public garden in Moscow . When she rebuffs him , he whips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own head off . It 's a barbaric practice , we learn , that 's known in Russia as American roulette . <P> That mixture of the grisly and the lighthearted is characteristic of Boris Akunin , who in Russia is roughly the counterpart of John Grisham but is virtually unknown here in the benighted Western world . ( Akunin is actually the pen name of a respected Georgian academic , Grigory Chkhartishvili . Do n't worry , no one in Russia can pronounce it either . ) The case of the suicidal swain lands in the lap of a fresh-faced , foppish but surprisingly resourceful young detective named Erast Fandorin , who quickly becomes swept up in a glamorous whirl of moneyed expatriates and gambling , champagne-guzzling aristocrats . You 'll understand right away what the Russians see in Akunin : he writes gloriously pre-Soviet prose , sophisticated and suffused in Slavic melancholy and thoroughly worthy of 19th century forebears like Gogol and Chekhov . The Winter Queen is as delicate and elegant as a Faberge egg , and , thank the Czars , we still have nine more untranslated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITSELF , by Walter Mosley ( Little , Brown ; 316 pages ) <P> Fear Itself is subtitled A Fearless Jones Novel , but the narrator-hero is actually a brainy and somewhat wimpy bookstore owner named Paris Minton . " I 'm a small man , " he tells us . " I 've been chased , caught , and beaten by big-boned women . " Fearless Jones , it turns out , is Paris ' best friend and polar opposite : superhumanly strong , infernally lucky , ridiculously handsome and very , very good at beating people up . You might say Paris plays Watson to Fearless 's Sherlock Holmes , if Holmes had been a jock instead of a nerd.
