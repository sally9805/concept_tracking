Chapter One Journal Entry-January 4-Friday Ten Tortures for Courtney Procter 1 . Tell her she 's finally growing into her face . 2 . Organize a boycott of her show 's sponsors . 3 . Send her a silicon recall notice . 4 . Get a convict to mail her fan letters from prison . 5 . Tell everyone who she used to date-and why he dumped her . " ... officially ruled an accident , but the sleepy coastal town of Paradise still holds one woman responsible for the tragedy that took prominent politician Victor Winslow- his beautiful young widow , Sandra . Despite last night 's ruling by the state medical examiner , unsettling questions persist . " The bluish image flickered as the camera tightened its shot on the blond TV reporter . " Witnesses who last saw State Senator Winslow alive on the night of February ninth have testified that he was engaged in a heated argument with his wife . An anonymous caller reported that the Winslows ' car was traveling at a high rate of speed when it spun out of control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investigators later discovered a bullet embedded in the car 's dashboard . Traces of the victim 's blood were detected on Mrs. Winslow 's clothing . " None of this was sufficient to satisfy the state 's burden of proof that a murder occurred , but this reporter promises to investigate further the trail leading to the late Senator Winslow 's wife , the sole beneficiary of a large life insurance policy ... " And so Sandra Winslow , known locally as the Black Widow of Blue Moon Beach , is left with only her conscience for company . This is Courtney Procter , WRIQ News . " Sandra Winslow set down her journal and pen . Picking up the remote control , she aimed it at the morning newscaster 's taut , surgically enhanced face . " Bang , " she said , pressing the OFF button . " You 're dead . What part of ' ruled an accident ' did n't you get , Courtney Proctologist ? " She stood and walked to the broad , bow-front window , with her arms wrapped around the emptiness inside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident ruling had come through-but the local news report left the door open for trouble . No matter what the ME ruled , there were those who would always hold her responsible . A harsh wind , on the leading edge of the coming storm , flattened the clacking dune grasses and churned the waters of the Sound into a froth . A handcrafted suncatcher in the shape of a bird vibrated against the windowpane , stirring memories she could n't escape . Sandra felt so far away from the person she 'd once been , and not just because she 'd moved into the old beach house after being released from the hospital . Only a year go , she 'd sat at the head table of the Newport Marina ballroom , wearing a pink knitted suit with black trim and matching shoes , her gloved hands folded in her lap . With his trademark panache , her husband held forth from the podium , speaking with compelling eloquence of his commitment to the citizens who had just elected him to a second term . He 'd spoken of service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of love , he could make even the most jaded heart believe . He 'd singled Sandra out as his steady anchor in the shifting seas of politics . His family and friends surrounded her in a warm cocoon of affection , as if she were truly one of them . After the speech , she sipped coffee , shared small talk and smiles , held other women 's babies and stood proudly at the side of her famous husband . The man who was missing , and now presumed dead . She stared out the window , tucking ink-smudged hands into the back pockets of her jeans . For Sandra , there was no " presumed " about Victor 's death . She knew . The wounded morning sky , as lackluster as midwinter itself , grew duller rather than brighter with the coming day . Looking out over the gray-shadowed beach , she felt a piercing loneliness , so sharp and cold that she flinched and hugged the oversized sweater tighter around her . Victor 's sweater . She shut her eyes and inhaled with a shudder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clean and tinged with ... him . Just him . Damn Victor . How could he have done this , told her those things and then died on her ? One minute you love someone , she thought , you believe you 're tied to him forever , the next minute fate cuts you loose . And all the disillusionment and shattered hopes had nowhere to go . She picked up the notebook again , flipped the page and read over her notes for the story she was working on . Her editor had already granted a sixty-day extension , and she was coming to the end of the second deadline . If she did n't turn in the manuscript soon , she 'd have to repay the money they 'd advanced her to write the novel in the first place . The money-modest sum that it was-had been spent long ago on luxuries such as groceries and legal fees . Even though she 'd never been charged with a crime , she had incurred an amazing sum of attorneys ' fees . Now , at last , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profiting from Victor 's death made her feel queasy . But she had to do something , had to pick up her life and figure out a way to go on . It was torture for her to live in Paradise , among the people who had adored her husband . Sometimes she even went up the road to Wakefield to run errands simply because she did n't want to encounter anyone who had known Victor . The trouble was , everyone knew Victor . Thanks to his family name and the swift incandescence of his political career , followed by his spectacular demise , the whole state knew him now . Sandra would have to go somewhere far away to escape his shadow . And now , finally , she had a chance to do that . Something unexpected was happening inside her . She was free , unattached . She had nothing to hold her now-not Victor 's political calendar , certainly not any social obligations . A soaring sense of freedom rose like a raft of birds from a marsh . Now that the death investigation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hovering in her mind for months . She could fix up the place , sell it , hit the road . Her destination did n't seem to matter as much as the urge to run . She picked up a flyer she 'd found on a community bulletin board outside the post office . " Paradise Construction- Restoration and Remodeling . Bonded and Insured . References . " Grabbing the phone before she could change her mind , she dialed the number and got-not surprisingly- a voice-mail message . Sandra hesitated , not sure what to say . Her house was in a state of extreme disrepair . She needed a specialist . She settled for leaving the address and phone number . Outside , gale-force winds tore at the wild sea roses under the window . Thorns scratched across the wavy , sleet-smeared glass pane . No wonder ships lost their way in these waters ; she could barely detect the slow blink of the Point Judith lighthouse in the distance . The bone-deep , icy cold of the winter storm reached invisible fingers through the cracks and chinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a log for the woodstove . It was the last one in the bin . The stove door opened with a rusty yawn , and she laid the log on the embers . Aiming the bellows , she pumped away until the glowing heart of the coals reddened and then burst into little tongues of flame licking along the underside of the log . Not so long ago , she had n't known the first thing about heating with a wood-stove . Now it was as routine as brushing her teeth . As the blaze took hold , she adjusted the vents and picked up her journal again . Ten Advantages to Being Poor 1 . You learn to build fires for warmth . 2 . You can tell phone solicitors to- Who was she kidding ? She 'd never come up with ten . Setting aside the messy notebook , she glared at the small , furious fire . She felt like the Little Match Girl , burning up her whole supply of matches . Hans Christian Andersen 's heroine had been at her wits ' end , her survival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last bit of firewood gone , curled into a fetal position in front of the stove . Who would find her there ? She imagined weathered bones being discovered years in the future , when her memory was no more than a scandalous blot on the history of the town and some developer hired a wrecking crew to demolish the ancient house and replace it with a high-rise of oceanfront condos . She wondered if other people had these thoughts when they ran out of firewood . Some of the local teenagers earned money by splitting and stacking wood for the summer people , who liked to build bonfires on the beach for clam bakes . But despite the new ruling , Sandra was pretty certain she would n't find anyone willing to split wood for her , not in this town . The icy wind crescendoed , howling under the eaves of the old beach house , entering through the cracks , making a mockery of the tepid heat from the last stick of wood in the stove . The big house had been in her father 's family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summer retreat . Ever since , the old place had sat abandoned and neglected , like a bleached skull at the edge of nowhere . Although the house was n't insulated for winter visitors , Sandra had no choice but to live here now . At least she had a roof over her head . But her husband was dead and no matter what the truth was , everyone blamed her . She held secrets in her heart that she would take to the grave . Staring out the rain-lashed window again , she tried not to feel the cold drilling into her bones . The storm had pummeled the dead tangles of brier in the field beside her house . On the beach , the wrack line lay thick with whatever flotsam the waves had driven home . A delicate rime of frost silvered everything-the dunes , the rocks , the windows of the house she could n't afford to heat . Heat . This was getting ridiculous . She put on a heavy plaid coat , stuffed her feet into gumboots and headed outside . The rain had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . As she crossed the driveway toward the garage and shed , a flutter of paper at the side of the road caught her eye . When the rumors had started , she used to find the occasional roll of toilet paper hurled from a car , draping the overgrown hedge by her mailbox . She ought to be used to the humiliation by now , but she was n't . Hers was a typical rural mailbox , poking out from a hedge of wild roses-nothing special , not even marked with a name . Just the house number . The small metal box lay torn to bits in the ditch beside the road . The crooked red signal flag lay in the middle of the pavement , pointing south . The galvanized steel housing had been reduced to twisted wreckage-a plane crash in miniature . " My God , " Sandra said through chattering teeth . " Now what ? " Firecrackers ; probably some local kid 's cherry bomb or M-80 . Why had n't she heard them ? Maybe last night 's storm had drowned out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car backfiring . Driven by the bitter wind , the mail rolled and tumbled along the ditch and roadside . She recognized the cover of a lingerie catalog she never ordered from , a sheaf of oil-change coupons she would forget to use until they expired , and the daily credit card solicitation . Even when the whole world was against you , the credit card companies still wanted you to shop . Kicking the debris around with the toe of her boot , she recognized a telltale scrap of pale blue and picked it up . The paper was the color of a check from her literary agency . Sure enough , there had been a check in the box . When Victor was alive , her modest earnings had been a rather gratifying bonus . Now that he was gone , the money meant survival . She suspected the vandals did n't give a rat 's ass about her survival . People still thought she was the Black Widow . Sandra crushed the paper in her hand . Enough . She 'd had enough . Something cracked inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a rock . Enough . At the lean-to by the garage , she glared at the stack of fat , seasoned logs . Flinging the torn check aside , she grabbed the maul from its hook , used her foot to roll a log onto the colorless grass and set it upright . She brought the blade of the maul down squarely into the heart of the log , splitting it apart . The pith of the wood was pale , slightly moist , fragrant with a clean scent . Setting up each broken half , she split them one after another , a little surprised by her deadly accuracy with the maul . Finally she picked up each split quarter and tossed it into the rusty wheelbarrow to take back to the house . She moved on to the next log , and then the next , whaling away with a sense of purpose as hot and clean as new fire . She had no notion of time passing , though the stack of quartered firewood in the wheelbarrow grew steadily . She was like a machine , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until sweat mingled with the tears pouring down her face . ( Continues ... )
