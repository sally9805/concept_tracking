On the morning of Sept. 11 , as she drove to her job at the gift shop at the Oklahoma City National Memorial , Doris Jones learned from the radio that two planes had flown into the World Trade Center . As she walked into the memorial building , she paused at a picture of a curly-haired young woman that hangs on the fence outside . " I think there are a lot of new angels up there with you today , " she said to the frozen image of her daughter Carrie Lenz , who died in the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building when she was 26 and six months pregnant . <P> Weeks ahead of New Yorkers , people in Oklahoma City understood what it meant when the Twin Towers collapsed . Until last month , their city was known for the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil . They 'd spent six years educating themselves on terror 's ills and elixirs , turning this corner of the Bible Belt into one of the largest concentrations of terrorism experts in the country . As with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their co-workers in minutes . Some families lost all their children . They started using words like " hypervigilance " and " a new normal " in everyday conversation . <P> Looking at the memorial , it is possible to glimpse New York City 's future . How long will it be before there is a memorial gift shop in Battery Park that sells children 's books called Let 's Talk About Anger ? Visitors look at the 168 chairs standing sentry at the pristine memorial and try to fathom 5,000 . At the anniversary of the Oklahoma City blast , people traditionally stand in silence one second for each victim  --  168 seconds , or nearly three minutes , which feels excruciating . To do the same in New York City would take almost an hour and a half . <P> Oklahoma City survivors are quick to point out that the two attacks were very different . Even some who lost children in the ' 95 blast now refer to it as " our little bombing . " But if pressed , they concede they have much to teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened here is any indication of what will happen there  --  and it is , thankfully , the only indicator we have  --  then here is the good news first : in the 10th month after the bombing , five more babies came into the world in Oklahoma City hospitals than in the state 's other urban counties . A year later , it was 16 more births a month ; two years later , 37 . University of Oklahoma researcher Joseph Lee Rodgers attributes the spike to a desire to replace life and a need , in a time of instability , to solidify one 's role in the world . <P> But here too is what New York and Washington will likely experience : six months from now , nearly half the people who were in the immediate vicinity of the attacks will have a psychiatric disorder , a figure based on a 1999 study of Oklahoma City survivors . At least a third will have post-traumatic stress disorder . That meant hundreds of people in Oklahoma City ; it will mean many thousands in New York . Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in counseling . Some will just be starting  --  particularly rescue workers . People who lost spouses and children in the building will still keep phone lists next to their bed so they can call one another in the middle of the night . In Oklahoma City , at least six people who survived or lost loved ones in the Murrah building have killed themselves . Others have lost marriages and custody rights as a result of new addictions.
