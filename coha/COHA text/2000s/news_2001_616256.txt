<p> St. Simons Island Here is a drawing of a gorilla trying to crush Arnold Palmer . On the coat rack is a Frankenstein mask and a Canadian Mountie 's uniform . Decorating the walls are original drawings from Harvey Kurtzman , Charles Schulz and other cartoon luminaries . In the floor-to-ceiling shelves are stacks of Mad magazines , boxes of slides from " Mad trips " labeled " Africa " and " Tahiti , " reams of penciled roughs  --  in short , a bristling database of wild-hair images from the fertile mind of 76-year-old Jack Davis Jr. , all neatly classified and organized . <p> The studio is a bit like the man : deceptively methodical on the outside , bulging with mania on the inside . " People were always surprised that he was an artist , " says his wife , Dena . " They said , ' You look more like you work in a bank . ' " <p> Davis  --  St. Simons resident , Atlanta native and Buckhead Boy in excelsis  --  is considered one of the greatest illustrators and cartoonists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contributor to Mad magazine from its birth in 1952 until the mid-1990s , he brought to life the goofy stories that entertained and informed two generations of wisenheimers . <p> His artwork has adorned at least 36 Time magazine covers , 80 album covers , scores of movie posters and dozens of dust jackets . In display advertising , his illustrations have hawked countless products , from pizza to athlete 's foot cream . <p> His relaxed but energetic line and his bug-eyed , big-footed characters have become an unmistakable feature of the American visual vernacular . <p> This spring , the National Cartoonists Society named Davis Cartoonist of the Year , giving him the Reuben Award , the NCS equivalent of a Pulitzer Prize . <p> He had already won the group 's equally prestigious Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award , named after the artist behind the comic strip " Terry and the Pirates , " which in the mid- ' 40s appeared in 300 newspapers . <p> " I think Jack is probably the most successful illustrator of any illustrator in history , " says syndicated cartoonist Daryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " just in terms of how we illustrators measure success . We measure it by ( asking ) how big is the job ? How many people see it ? " <p> Hundreds of millions have seen Davis ' work , which has never been cataloged but which is made up of thousands of pieces . Colleagues say he 's had a significant impact on other artists , with a style and sensibility that attracts many imitators . <p> Davis is quite natty , but his characters are deeply unkempt . They are often homely . Their buttons are n't done , their shoelaces are untied . Little specks flying from their gaping mouths indicate that they spray when they talk , and the flies circling their unwashed heads give testimony to some strong aromas . <p> Among the wannabes , the bona fide Davis hand is instantly recognizable , down to a drawing 's tiniest details . Says fellow Mad artist Sergio Aragones , " Even if you just see a shoe , you know it 's a Jack Davis shoe . Very few men can do that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . The celebrity illustrators of the first part of this century  --  artists such as Howard Pyle , Norman Rockwell and N.C. Wyeth  --  were known coast to coast . But Davis can travel with anonymity in most places , inside Georgia and out . <p> " I go to cocktail parties and they ask , ' What do you do ? ' and I say I 'm a cartoonist , " explains Davis over a light beer and a bacon-tomato sandwich ( no lettuce ) at Hampton Plantation , the country club where he plays golf . " They say , ' Oh , what strip do you do ? ' and I say I do n't have a strip . ' Well then , what paper are you with ? ' and I say I do n't do editorial cartoons . So I have to explain it all from the beginning . " <p> In the beginning was " Popeye "  --  for inspiration  --  followed shortly by " The Katzenjammer Kids " and " Prince Valiant . " The young John Burton Davis Jr . devoured these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the family home on Peachtree Road in Buckhead , laboriously copying the characters in his own hand . <p> Davis sent off his cartoons to competitions , publishing his first work at age 11 in the December 1936 issue of Tip Top comics . " I think I won a dollar , " he says . <p> He yearned to be a cartoonist , and even the arrival of World War II would n't stop him . After enlisting in the Navy out of North Fulton High School in 1943 , he was stationed first in Pensacola , Fla. , then at the Agana Naval Air Base in Guam . There he hatched a Sad Sack-like character called Seaman Swabby for a strip called Boondocker that ran weekly in the Navy News . <p> Back in the United States , Davis enrolled at the University of Georgia , taking plenty of drawing classes and doing poorly in almost every other subject . Gesturing at a Charles Schulz original on his studio wall that features academic underachiever Peppermint Patty , Davis says he felt a certain affinity with that lackluster scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GI Bill , they would have kicked me out of there , " he says of UGA . Though he never graduated , he would become one of Georgia 's most visible alumni . <p> While his schoolwork was weak , his artwork grew stronger . He helped out artist Ed Dodd by drawing backgrounds for the nature strip " Mark Trail . " Winning a summer internship at The Atlanta Journal , he drew sports cartoons and did courtroom sketches at the notorious Refoule trial . The Refoule sketches interested executives at Coca-Cola , who hired him to illustrate a training manual for Coke drivers . This earned him enough cash to buy a car and move to New York , which in 1950 was the mecca for cartoonists and graphic artists . <p> It was a trying time . While studying at the Arts Students League , he shopped his ideas for cartoon strips ; all were rejected . He could n't get hired at comic book publishers . He missed his fiancee Dena Roquemore , still in school at Georgia . A con artist sold him a fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But he also had a few breaks . He landed a job inking the strip " The Saint " at the New York Herald-Tribune , and when the Tribune folded , he found his way to E.C . Publications , a collection of four-color comic books devoted to war , crime , science fiction and horror . <p> E.C . editor Al Feldstein describes the transplanted Southerner , with his drawl and his high-top brogans , as a bit like Jed Clampett come to town . " If there was a stalk of hay sticking out of his teeth , it would have been appropriate . " But his work was great , and best of all , he was fast . " Oh God , he was fast , " says Feldstein , now retired to a Montana ranch . " I 'd give him 10 days to do a job , and I knew he played golf four of those 10 days . " <p> Being fast was a matter of survival , says Davis . When he handed in work , E.C . cut a check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The faster he worked , the more money he made . <p> Davis ' grotesque side was a perfect fit for such titles as " Tales From the Crypt , " " Weird Science " and " The Vault of Horror . " <p> In the unofficial competition among E.C . artists to draw the most horrifying images , Davis ' ax-murdering husbands and disemboweled baseball players often came out on top . Then , ambitious Tennessee Sen. Estes Kefauver determined that comic books were a leading cause of juvenile delinquency . During the Kefauver hearings , Davis ' artwork was held up as a scurrilous example of material destined to corrupt young people . <p> Davis was terribly embarrassed by the attention , and once the hearings were over , he burned all his E.C . comics . Today the 10-cent rags sell to collectors for $1,000 apiece , mint . <p> " I was n't proud of it , " he says now . " It was tongue-in-cheek horror stuff , but it probably gave some kid nightmares . " <p> The comic book publishers decided to regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Gaines folded all of his titles except one , a humor comic started in 1952 by Harvey Kurtzman called Mad . Davis ' artwork was in Mad from its first issue , and Gaines quickly transformed Mad from a comic into a magazine , to avoid the strictures of the Comics Code Authority . <p> When Kurtzman left Mad in 1957 to pursue a Hugh Hefner-financed humor magazine called Trump , Davis went along . But Trump lasted only two issues . Scrambling for work , Davis did gags for Playboy , Esquire and a few short-lived Kurtzman enterprises including Humbug and Help ! He also branched into commercial work , drawing display ads for NBC television , Jell-O , Spalding , Mennen and other products . <p> When he came back to Mad in 1965 , he was making better money elsewhere , but he loved the break from the confines of commercial art . " Jack continued to do artwork for me at my lousy rates , " says Feldstein , " even though he was doing album covers and Time magazine covers . " <p> Davis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flannel suburbs of Westchester County , where they raised two children , Jack III and Katie . The Davises lived a fairly straight-arrow existence , though none of their son 's friends would believe that . <p> " People would drive slowly past our house thinking some crazy person lived there , " says Jack Davis III , an Atlanta architect who designed his parents ' spacious St. Simons home . So he 'd make up stories just to satisfy their curiosity . " I 'd tell them we did n't have to wear clothes until we were teenagers . " <p> The place was littered with the elder Davis ' work  --  except for his work on the Playboy cartoon Little Annie Fannie , for which he drew the backgrounds . Dena did n't approve . <p> The father 's career took a step upward when he created the poster for the 1963 Stanley Kramer movie " It 's A Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World , " placing his fevered vision before the eyes of millions . <p> The illustration is vintage Davis . More than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosh pit of humanity sprinkled with horses , dogs , bicycles , airplanes and other conveyances . There are dozens of recognizable caricatures in the crowd , including Spencer Tracy , Phil Silvers and Ethel Merman . <p> For the movie opening , " He brought us all into ( Manhattan ) in our Ford Country Squire station wagon , " remembers Jack III . " It was on Broadway , this billboard , four or five stories tall , with all these people chasing Spencer Tracy . That was quite a moment . " <p> Not all the moments are memorable . Davis has illustrated many a forgettable ad for trade and in-flight magazines , selling rental cars and motel rooms . Describing a piece he was brainstorming last month for an energy industry publication , he said the story was intolerably dull , but  --  what the heck  --  a man 's got ta eat . <p> " He cranks it out as fast as they need it to be cranked out , " says Hank Harrison , a Texas writer who has edited two large-format picture books on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put it all in a personal museum , he does n't worry about that , he just goes on to the next piece . " <p> Davis also does n't worry about his blunders . He even frames some of them . On his studio wall is a caricature of Chris Evert drawn for a George Dickel ad campaign . Minor detail : Her racket is in the wrong hand . Evert did n't mind , because Davis turned her from a tennis star into a really stacked tennis star . She autographed the picture : " Thanks for making me a lefty and busty ! ! ! " <p> Davis did n't move back to Georgia for almost 40 years , but cut him and he 'd bleed UGA red ( and India ink black ) . He 'd return regularly for the Georgia-Florida game and has sketched hundreds of Dawg characters and other artwork for University of Georgia program covers , media guides and billboards . " He 's been a Bulldog through and through , " says athletic director Vince Dooley . <p> Davis draws his Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the big game . In appreciation , the Athletic Association helped fund the Jack Davis Distinguished Visiting Artist Lecture series at the school , which will bring caricaturist David Levine to Georgia for a presentation next spring . <p> His Winsor &; Newton brushes and Croquill pens seem suited to Southern characters , which may be why his artwork has graced books by such Southern humorists as William Price Fox , Lewis Grizzard and Robert Steed . Having Davis illustrate his books , says Steed , " is like having Picasso do your Christmas cards . " <p> The Davises became fond of St. Simons after spending many summers in nearby Sea Island . They moved back to Georgia in 1989 , building a house on the once empty , now built up northern end of St. Simons . They share their home with Too-Too , a white miniature poodle who greets visitors with the ferocity of a killer cotton swab . <p> This setting , with its elegant , ancient live oaks and Spanish moss , seems all wrong . Davis ' spotless Lowcountry home , his University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiate conventionality . But when the artist invites you back to his sun-washed studio , stuffed with mementos of a lifetime of Madness , the inner Jack Davis begins to emerge . <p> Davis ' drafting table looks across the Hampton River toward Little St. Simons and the Sapelo Lighthouse . Porpoises swim up to the seawall in his back yard and wood storks land in his palmettos . After half a lifetime in the Northern wilderness , he is home . <p> Not really retired , he 's just working slightly slower . " I want to get better , " he says , looking pleased to be parking his easel in a land where Poss ' barbecue is always close at hand . <p> " I just sit over here by myself and look out at the river , " says the artist , with a dreamlike smile . " I listen to my country music and  --  just float away . "
