1 <p> I was a child of eight in April of the year of our Lord fourteen hundred and ninety-eight . I lived in a pretty , rural town on the south bank of the Loire River , where a fortified chGteau faced with white stone graced the hill above . This castle had been much restored by France 's King Charles VIII , and his court spent a good part of every year in residence there . Both the town and the chGteau were called Amboise . <p> My mother , Jeanne Popyncourt , for whom I was named , served as a lady-in-waiting to the queen of France . My father , until his death six months earlier , followed the court from place to place , taking lodgings in nearby towns so that Maman could visit us whenever she was not in attendance on Queen Anne . We had a modest house in Amboise and several servants to see to our needs . After Papa died , Maman added a governess to the household to look after me . <p> I was so often in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood children . I spent a great deal of time with one in particular , a boy of my own years named Guy Dunois . Guy taught me how to play card games and climb trees , and he made me laugh by crossing his eyes . They were a bright blue-green and always full of mischief . <p> Then everything changed when King Charles died . When word of it spread throughout Amboise , people went out into the street just to stare up at the chGteau . Some had tears in their eyes . Madame AndrTe , my governess , told me to stay in my bedchamber , but from my window I could see that she and everyone else in the household was outside . Guy and his mother were out there , too . I was just about to disobey Madame 's orders and join them when a cloaked and hooded figure burst into the room . I let out a yelp . Then I recognized my mother . <p> " We must leave at once on a long journey , " Maman announced . <p> Surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the prospect of a great adventure , I clapped my hands in delight . I treasured the hours I spent in my mother 's company , the more so since the loss of my father . For the most part , Maman and I could only be together when she did not have duties at court . As she was one of Queen Anne 's favorite ladies , she was rarely free . <p> " Where are we going ? When do we leave ? What shall I pack ? " <p> " No questions , Jeanne , I beg you . " <p> " But I must say farewell to Guy and my other friends , else they will wonder what became of me . " <p> " There is no time . " She had already stuffed my newest , finest garments into the leather pannier she 'd brought . " Don your cloak , and change those shoes for your sturdiest pair of boots . " <p> When I 'd done as she asked , I held out a poppet I treasured , a cloth baby with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked sad , but she shook her head . " There is no room . " <p> She left behind my comb and brush and my slate and my prayer book , too . With one last look around the chamber to assure that she 'd packed everything she thought necessary , she grasped my hand and towed me after her to the stable . <p> A horse waited there , already saddled and carrying a second bulging pannier . I looked around for a groom , but no one was in sight , nor had Maman hired any guards to escort and protect us . <p> Many people were leaving Amboise in the wake of the king 's death . " Where are they all going in such a hurry ? " I asked as I rode on a pillion behind Maman , clinging tightly to her waist . <p> " To Blois , to the new king . " <p> " Is that where we are going ? " <p> " No , my darling . Please be silent , Jeanne . " <p> She was my mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry , so I obeyed her . <p> Once free of the town , she avoided the main roads . When I 'd made journeys with my father in the past , we 'd spend our nights in private houses , mostly the country manors belonging to his friends . But Maman chose to take rooms in obscure inns , or lodge in the guest quarters of religious houses . It was not as pleasant a way to travel . The beds were often lumpy and sometimes full of fleas . <p> Maman said I must not speak to anyone , and she rarely did so herself . We both wore plain wool cloaks with the hoods pulled up to hide our faces . It was almost as if she feared being recognized as a lady of the French court . <p> Our journey took two months , but at last we reached the Pale of Calais , on the north coast of France . Maman reined in our horse and breathed an audible sigh . " We are on English soil now , Jeanne . This land belongs to King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her obvious relief at having left our country , but I dared not ask why . <p> A few days later , we had a rough sail across the treacherous body of water the English called the Narrow Seas , finally arriving in the town of Dover . It was the twelfth day of June , two days after Trinity Sunday , and the English port was in an uproar . The authorities were searching for an escaped prisoner who had been held under light guard at the English king 's palace of Westminster . His name was Perkin Warbeck  --  and he was a pretender to the throne . <p> My mother was much troubled by this news . She had met Perkin Warbeck years before when he visited the French court of King Charles . At the time he claimed to be the true king of England and had been seeking help from our king to overthrow England 's Henry VII . <p> Although I was by nature a curious child , I had little interest in the furious search for Warbeck . I was too caught up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we traveled overland to London . Everything was new and different  --  the language , the clothes , even the crops . We traveled for the better part of three days through the English countryside before we reached the city . <p> In London , we took a room at the King 's Head , an inn in Cheapside , and Maman sent word of our arrival to her twin brother , Rowland Velville , whom she had not seen in many years , not since he had left home to serve as a page for an English exile named Henry Tudor . That done , we settled in to wait for him . <p> Our chamber looked out upon the innyard . To pass the time , I watched the arrivals and departures of guests and the ostlers at work . Servants crisscrossed the open space dozens of times a day on errands . Deliveries were made . Horses were led to stabling . Once I saw a young woman , cloaked and hooded , creep stealthily from her room to another . It was a noisy , busy place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had no idea how long we would have to remain where we were . <p> On the third morning of our stay , the eighteenth day of June , I was awakened by the sound of hammering . I slipped out of bed , shivering a little in my shift , and went to the window . From that vantage point I had a clear view of a half dozen men constructing the oddest bit of scaffolding I had ever seen . It was made entirely of empty wine pipes and hogsheads of wine . <p> When it was completed , the men secured a heavy wooden object to the top . I blinked , bemused , but I was certain I was not mistaken . I had seen stocks before . Even in France , those who committed certain crimes were made to sit in them while passersby threw refuse and insults their way . <p> " Jeanne , come away from there ! " <p> I turned to find my mother sitting up in bed , her face all flushed from sleep . I thought her surpassing beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her a hug and a kiss . I loved the feel of Maman 's skin , which was soft as flower petals and smelled of rose water . <p> " What is all that hammering ? " she asked . <p> " Some men built a scaffold out of wine pipes and hogsheads and put stocks on top of it . Is the innyard like a marketplace ? Do you think it is the custom to punish criminals at the King 's Head ? " <p> " I think only very special prisoners would merit such treatment . We must dress , and quickly . " Her face , always pale , had turned white as the finest parchment . I did not understand what was wrong , but I was afraid . <p> We had to play tiring maid to each other , having brought no servants with us from France . I laced Maman into a pale gold bodice and kirtle and helped her don the long rose-colored gown that went over it . We did have fine clothing , and Maman had taken special pains to pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet and the colors were rich and vibrant . <p> By the time we dressed and broke our fast with bread and ale , a great to-do had arisen in the innyard . Together , as the bell in a nearby church tower rang out the hour of ten , we stepped out onto the low-railed gallery beyond the window and looked down . <p> A man had been placed in the stocks . His long yellow hair was dirty , and his fine clothing rumpled and soiled , but he still had the look of someone important . It was difficult to tell his age . He slumped like an old man and , since I was only eight , almost everyone seemed ancient to me . In fact , he was no older than my mother , and she was just twenty-four . <p> The crowd , noisy and jostling , swelled as we watched . They jeered at the prisoner and called him names . He had been put on public display as punishment for some crime . I understood that much . What continued to puzzle me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he ? " I asked . " What did he do ? " <p> I spoke in French , in the high , ringing voice of childhood . A man in a lawyer 's robe looked up , suspicion writ large upon his swarthy , ill-favored countenance . Those few words had drawn attention to us . Worse , they had marked us as foreigners . Maman hastily retreated into the chamber , pulling me after her , and closed the shutters . <p> " Who is he ? " I asked again . <p> " Perkin Warbeck , " she answered . " The pretender the soldiers were looking for in Dover . " <p> The noise outside our window increased as the day wore on until finally , at just past three of the clock , Warbeck was taken away under heavy guard . A scant quarter of an hour afterward , my uncle arrived . <p> " You have grown up , Rowland , " my mother said as she hugged her twin hard . " But I would have known you anywhere . You have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her brother since they were nine . Within three years Rowland 's leaving home , Henry Tudor had become King Henry VII of England . <p> " And you , my dear sister , " Rowland Velville said courteously , " have a most pleasing countenance . " <p> " Jeanne , " she said , turning to me , " this is your uncle , Master Rowland Velville . " <p> " Sir Rowland , " he corrected her , sparing one hard stare for me . <p> I studied the two of them while they talked quietly together , fascinated by their similarities . Both were blessed with thick brown hair and large , deep-set brown eyes . I shared their coloring , but my eyes have golden flecks . I was extraordinarily pleased with that small difference . I did not want to be just like anyone else , not even my beloved mother . <p> My uncle 's nose was large , long , and thin . My mother 's , too , was thin , but much smaller . Mine was the smallest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle was of above-average height . Maman came up to his shoulder . Both of them were slender , as was I. <p> Having given her brother a brief account of our journey , Maman described the scene we had witnessed in the innyard . " Poor man , " she said , meaning Perkin Warbeck . <p> " Do not waste your sympathy ! " Uncle sounded so angry that I took a quick step away from him . " He is naught but an imposter , a commoner 's son impersonating royalty . " <p> Maman 's brow furrowed . " I know that , Rowland . What I do not understand is why he would try to escape . The rebellion ended months ago . We heard about it at the French court , including how King Henry forgave Warbeck for leading it . " <p> " Your information is remarkably accurate . " <p> " Any tale of the English court soon reaches the ears of the king of France . No doubt the English king has similar sources who report on every rumor that comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does , I am not privy to what they tell him . He has never confided in me . " <p> Maman looked relieved to hear it . <p> " King Henry does not always reward those who deserve it . " <p> " He has been generous to you . You have been made a knight . " <p> " An honor long overdue . " He sounded bitter . " And there were no lands to go with it . He takes more care for the future of this fellow Warbeck ! As soon as the pretender admitted that he was an imposter , the king gave him leave to remain at court . He was under light guard but was treated like a guest . Warbeck 's wife fared even better . She has been appointed as one of Queen Elizabeth 's ladies and is accorded her full dignity as the daughter of a Scottish nobleman . " <p> " Lady Catherine Gordon , " Maman murmured . " Poor girl . She thought she 'd married a king and ended up with a mere commoner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of London from now on . He 'll not find life so easy in that fortress , nor will he have any further opportunity to escape . " <p> " The Tower of London ? It is a prison ? " Maman sounded confused . " I thought it was a royal palace . " <p> " It is both , often at the same time . Prisoners accused of treason and those of noble birth are held there . And kings have kept lodgings within the precincts from the earliest days of the realm . " <p> I tugged on my uncle 's dark blue sleeve until he glanced down with the liquid brown eyes so like my mother 's . " How could a commoner be mistaken for a prince ? " I asked . <p> " He was well coached by King Henry 's enemies . " My uncle went down on one knee so that we were face-to-face and caught me by the shoulders . " You are a clever girl , Jane , to ask me this . It is important that you know who people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do not know that the butcher 's wife is related by marriage to the blacksmith , you may do yourself much harm by speaking against him within her hearing . So , too , with plots and schemes . A family 's enmity can  --  " <p> " Rowland ! " My mother spoke sharply , cutting him off . " Do not continue , I beg of you . She is too young to understand . " <p> He gave a curt nod , but kept hold of my shoulders and looked me straight in the eye . <p> " Listen well , Jane . I will tell you a cautionary tale now and save the other story for another day . Many years ago , the two sons of the English king Edward the Fourth were declared illegitimate upon King Edward 's death by Edward 's brother , Richard the Third . Richard then took the throne for himself . Thereafter the princes disappeared . No one knows what happened to them , although most men believe that Richard the Third , now king , had them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a place called Bosworth and became King Henry the Seventh in his stead . To end civil war , Henry Tudor married Elizabeth of York , Edward 's eldest daughter , even though she , too , had been declared illegitimate by Richard 's decree . " <p> My uncle glanced at my mother . " King Henry the Seventh is especially sensitive just now on the subject of the royal bastards . " <p> " That is understandable , " Maman replied . Her expression was serene , her voice calm , but sadness shone in her eyes . <p> My uncle turned back to me to continue his history lesson . " But King Henry 's throne is not yet secure . He has been plagued by imposters claiming to be one of the missing princes . So far , his grace has always been able to discover their true identities and expose them , taking the heart out of the traitors who support them . But many rebellious souls still exist in England , men all too ready to rise up again , even in the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confusion . " I know what a bastard is , Uncle . It means you are born outside of marriage . My friend Guy Dunois is one . But if these two boys  --  who may or may not be dead  --  are bastards , why would anyone try to impersonate them ? They can not claim the throne even if they are alive . " <p> Uncle gave me an approving look . " I would not be so certain of that . Before marrying their sister , King Henry the Seventh reversed the royal decree that made her and her brothers illegitimate . So , dead they are and dead they must remain  --  for the good of the realm . " <p> My curiosity led me quickly to another question . " Why was Warbeck 's scaffold made of wine pipes and hogsheads ? " I asked . <p> The briefest hint of a smile came over my uncle 's face . " Because the popular belief is that the king 's navy came close to capturing Warbeck before he ever landed on these shores . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty wine barrel stowed in the prow of his ship . " <p> My mother 's fingers moved from her rosary to the silk sash at her waist . Her voice remained level , but the way she twisted the fine fabric around one hand betrayed her agitation . " With so much unrest in his land , " Maman said , " it is good of the king to take an interest in us . " <p> " Your future is not yet secure , Joan . " <p> " She is Jeanne , " I protested . " Jeanne Popyncourt . As I am . " <p> " No longer . You are in England now , my dear niece . Your mother will be known as Joan and you will be Jane , to distinguish between the two of you . " <p> " I do not understand , " I said . <p> " I will explain everything in good time , Jeanne , " Maman said . <p> " Jane , " Uncle insisted . <p> " Jane , then , " she continued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be revealed . But for the present it is best that you do not know too much . " <p> " And in the meantime , " my uncle interrupted , " you will both be provided for . Come . I am to take you to the king . " <p> " Now ? " The word came out as a hoarse croak . Maman 's eyes widened in alarm . " Now , " he insisted . <p> At my uncle 's urging , we gathered up our possessions and soon were aboard a wherry and headed upriver on an incoming tide . I sat between him and my mother in the pair-oared rowing boat . <p> The vessel 's awning kept the sun out of our faces , but it did not obscure my view . Attempting to see everything at once , I twisted from side to side on the cushioned bench . We had boarded the wherry just to the west of London Bridge and so had a good distance to travel before we passed beyond the sprawling city of London with its tall houses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curve of the Thames , the river broadened to reveal green meadows , riverside gardens , and a dazzling array of magnificent buildings that far outshone anything the city had to offer . <p> " That is Westminster Abbey , " my uncle said , pointing . " And there is the great palace of Westminster , where the king is waiting for us . " <p> Once we disembarked my uncle escorted us to the king 's privy chamber . I caught only a glimpse of bright tapestries and grand furnishings before a liveried servant conducted us into the small complex of inner chambers beyond . <p> " Why is it so much darker here ? " I whispered , catching hold of my mother 's sleeve . <p> " Hush , my darling . " <p> " Show some respect , " my uncle snapped . " Do you not realize what a great honor it is to be allowed to enter the king 's ' secret ' lodgings ? " <p> We moved briskly through one small chamber and into another . There the servant stopped before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " my uncle instructed in a harsh whisper . " Do not speak unless spoken to . Address the king as ' Sire ' or ' Your Grace ' when you do speak to him . And do not forget that you must back out of the room when you are dismissed . " <p> My eyes wide , my lips pressed tightly closed , I crept farther into the room . Like a little mouse , I felt awed and terrified by the prospect that lay before me  --  my first meeting with my new liege lord . <p> In those days , King Henry did not stoop , as he would toward the end of his life . He was as tall as my uncle , a thin man but one who gave the impression of strength . His nose was long and thin , too . He was dressed most grandly in cloth-of-gold and crimson velvet . His black velvet bonnet , sporting a jeweled brooch and pendant pearl , sat atop reddish brown hair . It was just starting to go gray . Beneath was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right cheek stood out in stark contrast . <p> I stared at him , my mouth dropping open , as fascinated as I was awestruck . King Henry regarded us steadily in return . For a considerable time , he said nothing . Then he dismissed his servants and sent my uncle away , too . <p> " You have your mother 's eyes , " he said to Maman , speaking in French . <p> " Thank you , Sire , " she said . " I wish I could remember her more clearly , but I have always been told that she was a most beautiful woman . " <p> This was the first that I had heard of my grandmother 's beauty . Maman rarely spoke of her parents . I knew only that her mother had died when she was a very young girl and that afterward her father had sent her to the ducal court of Brittany to enter the service of the duke 's daughter , Anne . <p> " I was sorry to hear of the death of your husband , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Your Grace . " <p> " A Fleming , was he not ? " <p> " He was . A merchant . " <p> There was a small , awkward silence . Maman was of gentle birth . She had married beneath her . I knew a little of the story . Maman had wed at fifteen and given birth to me the following January . Then she had returned to the Breton court . The following year , when Duchess Anne married King Charles , she had become part of the new French queen 's entourage . Papa had often shared the houses she found for me near the court , but sometimes he had to go away to attend to business . He imported fine fabrics to clothe courtiers and kings . <p> " Plague ? " the king asked , suggesting a likely cause for my father 's death . <p> Maman shook her head . " He had purchased a new ship for a trading venture . It proved unseaworthy and sank when he was aboard . He drowned . " <p> " A great pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Maman 's reply was too low for me to hear . When they continued their conversation in quiet voices , I heard their words only as a gentle whisper in the background . <p> My gaze wandered around the room . The chamber boasted no tapestries and had no gilded chests or chairs , but it did contain a free-standing steel looking glass . I longed to peer at my own face , but I did not dare move from where I stood . On a table next to the looking glass , a coffer overflowed with jewels . I also noticed books . I had never seen so many of them in one place before . <p> The restless movements of King Henry 's fingers , continually twisting the fabric of the narrow silk scarf he wore knotted around his waist , brought my attention back to the king . I strained to hear what he and my mother were saying , but I could only catch a word or two . The king said , " my wife " and then , " my protection . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " It is well that you are here . I give you my word that you will have a place at court as long as you both shall live . " A slow smile overspread his features . For some reason , he seemed mightily pleased that my mother and I had come to England . <p> " On the morrow , " the king said , addressing me directly , " you will be taken to the royal nursery at Eltham Palace . Henceforth you will be one of the children of honor . Your duties will be both simple and agreeable  --  you are to engage my two young daughters , the Lady Margaret and the Lady Mary , in daily conversation in French so that they will become fluent in that language . Margaret is only a few weeks older than you are , Jane , " the king added . " Mary is just three . " <p> " I will do my best to serve them , Your Grace , " I promised . <p> " I am certain that you will , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We spent that night in the great palace of Westminster , sharing a bed in a tiny , out-of-the-way chamber . I was certain good fortune had smiled upon us . I believed Maman and I would be together , serving in the same royal household . It was not until the next day , when I was about to board one of the royal barges for the trip downriver , that I learned the truth . Maman could not accompany me to Eltham . King Henry had made arrangements for her to remain at Westminster Palace . Like Lady Catherine Gordon , she was to be a lady-in-waiting to his wife , Queen Elizabeth of York . <p> " We will see each other often , " Maman promised as she kissed me farewell . " Queen Elizabeth is said to be devoted to her children . I am told she pays many visits to Eltham and that her sons and daughters regularly come to court . " <p> I clung to this reassurance as I was sent off on my own , speaking no English and knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodgings at court , escorted me to my new home , but he did not tarry . As quickly as he could , he scurried back to Westminster Palace . <br> <p> At the time I entered royal service at Eltham Palace , the king had four children . Arthur , the Prince of Wales and the heir to the throne , lived elsewhere . He was not quite twelve years old . Shortly before I arrived , King Henry 's second son , also Henry , who was seven and held the title Duke of York , had been given his own household staff within the larger establishment at Eltham . Nurses and governess had been dismissed . Male tutors had taken charge of the young prince 's education . <p> The two princesses , Margaret and Mary , shared a household staff . They also shared some of Prince Henry 's tutors , so that all the children of honor , boys and girls , came in daily contact with each other . That was why , within a few days of joining their ranks , I was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavane . <p> " Is all your dress fastened in place ? " the Italian dancing master asked . <p> For my benefit , he repeated the question in French . <p> Most of the boys in Prince Henry 's entourage had been taught French and spoke it fairly well , if with a peculiar accent . I turned to a boy named Harry Guildford , who had been assigned as my partner , and whispered , " Why is he so concerned about our clothing ? " <p> Harry Guildford was an affable lad a year my senior . His round face was remarkable for its large nose , the cleft in his chin , and his ready smile . The twinkle in his eyes reminded me of my friend in Amboise , Guy Dunois , except that Harry 's eyes were gray instead of blue-green . <p> " All manner of clothing can drop onto the floor in the course of a dance , if the movements are too energetic . That is why we must always check our points before we begin . " <p> By points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeches to doublets , and various other garments to each other . I could not imagine why anyone would be careless in fastening them in the first place , but I tugged at my sleeves and skirt to make sure all was secure . I had been given a white damask gown with crimson velvet sleeves , as well as gold chains and a circlet  --  a sort of livery . <p> " It is particularly vulgar for a lady to drop a glove while dancing , " our tutor continued , " as it causes gentlemen to bestir themselves and run like a flock of starlings to pick it up . " <p> " Do starlings run ? " I whispered to Harry . " I should have thought they flew . " <p> He thought my remark amusing and translated it for those who did not understand the French language . I had begun to pick up a little English , but I only realized that I 'd said something clever when Prince Henry smiled at me . <p> At seven he was a chubby child with small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fair complexion , almost girlish , and he already knew how to be charming . I smiled back . <p> The dancing master clapped his hands to signal the musicians to play . Then he watched with hawklike intensity as we went through our paces . Most of his attention was on Prince Henry and Princess Margaret , but as soon as I began to dance backward , he shrieked my name . <p> " Mademoiselle Jane ! It is bad manners for a lady to lift her train with her hands . You must sway in such a way as to shift the train out of the way before you step back . " <p> Frowning in concentration , I tried to follow his instructions , but there was so much to remember . What if I tripped on my own gown and tumbled to the floor ? Everyone would laugh at me . <p> My heart was in my throat as Harry and I continued to execute the gliding , swaying steps of the pavane . I felt a little more confident after he squeezed my hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish the dance without calling further attention to myself . <p> " Merci , " I said when the music ceased . " I am most grateful for your help . " <p> Harry executed a courtly bow . " My pleasure , mademoiselle . " <br> <p> By August , when I had been at Eltham for some six weeks , I could converse much more easily in English , although I still had trouble with some words . I spent several hours every morning in the nursery , playing with the Lady Mary and speaking with her in French . She was an exceptionally pretty child with blue eyes and delicate features . Slender , she gave promise of being tall when she grew to womanhood . Her hair was golden , with a reddish tinge . <p> In the afternoons , I attended the Lady Margaret , conversing with her in both French and English . Unlike her little sister , Margaret was dark eyed , with a round face and a thick , sturdy body . Her best features were her fresh complexion and her auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the other girls among the children of honor regarded me with suspicion because I did not speak their language . Margaret was sometimes temperamental and had a tendency to pout , and Mary was prone to tantrums . But I quickly learned how to avoid being the object of their wrath . The other girls resented me for that , too . <p> I also learned to play the lute and the virginals and to ride . One day we rode as far as another of King Henry 's palaces on the Thames . It was only a few miles from Eltham . <p> " What is this place ? " I asked , looking across an expanse of overgrown gardens to a huge complex of buildings . Scaffolding rose up in several places . Busy workmen swarmed like bees over one tower . <p> " It is called Pleasance , " the Lady Margaret said . <p> " Pleasure Palace ? " <p> My innocent mistake in translation produced immoderate laughter , especially from the two oldest children of honor , Ned Neville and Will Compton , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was named Pleasance because of its pleasing prospect , " Will said , " but there is pleasure to be had within those walls , too , no doubt of that . " <p> " I was born here , " Prince Henry said . " It is my favorite palace . I wish Father and Mother had not gone on progress . If they had come here , we could visit them . " <p> " They can not stay at Pleasance until the renovations are finished , " Margaret said . <p> Translating this exchange , I frowned . I had not seen my mother since we parted at Westminster on the morning after our meeting with the king . " What does going on progress mean ? " I asked , unfamiliar with the English word . <p> " The entire court moves from manor house to castle to palace , visiting different parts of the realm , " Harry Guildford explained . <p> " Sometimes they take us with them . " The Lady Margaret sounded wistful . <p> " Not this year , " Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Westminster Palace until the end of October . " <p> That meant I would not see Maman again for some time . Resigned , I dedicated myself to perfecting my English and mastering music , dance , and horseback riding . In September we all moved to Hatfield House , a palatial brick manor house in Hertfordshire , so that Eltham Palace could be cleaned and aired . <p> On a crisp , cloudless day a week later , when I had been one of the children of honor for nearly three months , the Lady Margaret and I strolled in the garden while we held our daily conversation . <p> " I was frightened for my life , " she confided , speaking of her reaction to the great fire at Sheen , another of her father 's palaces , the previous Yuletide . The entire royal family had been in residence at the time . They had been fortunate to escape unhurt . <p> " Fire is terrifying , " I agreed . " A house burned down in Amboise once when I was living there . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the men formed a line and passed buckets of water along to douse the flames . My friend Guy helped , too , for all that he was only a very little boy at the time . " <p> It had been weeks since I had thought of Guy , or any of my other friends in France . A little ripple of guilt flowed over me . Had they forgotten me , as well ? <p> Deep in thought , I rounded a bit of topiary work trimmed to resemble a dragon , one of King Henry 's emblems . A few steps ahead of me , the princess stopped in her tracks . " What man is that ? " She squinted at a figure just emerging from a doorway , her vision hampered by the distance . <p> My eyesight being more acute , I immediately recognized my uncle , Sir Rowland Velville . He strode rapidly toward us along the graveled path . <p> " Your Grace , " he greeted the Lady Margaret , bowing so low that his nose nearly touched the toe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word in private with my niece . " <p> " You may speak with her , but in our hearing , " Margaret said in an autocratic voice . <p> My uncle bowed a second time . " As you wish , Your Grace . " He turned to me , still as formal as he had been with the Lady Margaret . " Your mother , my beloved sister , has died , dear Jane . " He showed not a trace of emotion as he delivered his devastating news . " It happened suddenly , while she was on progress with the court . " <p> Stunned , I gaped at him , at first unable to form words , almost unable to think . The enormity of what he 'd said was too much for me to grasp . <p> As if from a great distance , I heard the Lady Margaret speak . " Of what did she die , Sir Rowland ? " <p> " A fever of some sort . I can not say for certain . I had gone on to Drayton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained where they were for a few days longer . " <p> Fighting a great blackness that threatened to swallow me , I sank down onto a nearby stone bench . I suppose that the sun shone as brightly as ever , but for me its light had dimmed . " No , " I whispered . " No . She can not be dead . You must be mistaken . " <p> " I assure you , I am not . I was present when she was buried at Collyweston . " <p> Tears flowed unchecked down my cheeks , but I scarcely felt them . I was only dimly aware that the Lady Margaret had left us . " No , " I said again . <p> " The king himself bade me bring this news to you , Jane . " I could hear a slight impatience in his voice . " Why would I lie to you ? " <p> " You ... you would not . " I accepted the handkerchief he proffered . <p> " I brought you this . " He gave me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of jewelry . Like the topiary work , it was in the shape of a dragon . I sobbed harder . <p> " She had little else . She sold most of her jewels to pay for the journey to England . But you need not be concerned about your future . You are one of the king 's wards now . He 'll look out for you . " I suppose Uncle meant to be comforting , but his words did nothing to lessen my sense of loss . <p> Having discharged his duty , my uncle left me sitting alone on a stone bench in the garden at Hatfield House . I do not know how much time passed as I cried my heart out . But when I had no more tears to shed , I looked up to find Will Compton leaning against a nearby tree . <p> At sixteen , Will was the oldest of Prince Henry 's children of honor . He had been sent to the royal nursery at Eltham when the prince was still a baby . He was a tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with concern . <p> " I am sorry for your loss , Jane . I know what it is to be orphaned . " <p> " My mother 's mother died when she was younger than I am now . " I do not know why I told him that , and I realized as I spoke that I had no idea when my mother 's father had died . I 'd never known any of my grandparents and , except for my uncle , had never met another Velville . If the rest of them , unlike Maman , were as unfeeling as he was , I did not want to . <p> " My father died when I was eleven . " Will sat down beside me on the bench and took my hand in his . " After that I became one of the king 's wards . " <p> " One of the king 's wards , " I repeated . " That is what my uncle said I am to be . What does that mean ? " <p> " That the king will look after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one day , arrange your marriage . You need never worry about having a roof over your head or food in your belly . You will always have a home at court and a place in the royal household . " <p> " With the Lady Margaret ? " <p> " Or with the Lady Mary . In a year or two each of them will have her own household and you will have to choose . " <p> A terrible thought came to me . " What if they should die ? " <p> His grip tightened painfully on my fingers . " Why would you think such a thing ? " <p> " Anyone can die . Even princesses . <p> " He nodded , his expression solemn . " You are right . King Henry and Queen Elizabeth had another daughter , born between Prince Henry and Princess Mary . She died when she was the same age the Lady Mary is now . " <p> Fresh tears made my vision blur . <p> " But the Prince of Wales lives and is healthy , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret or the Lady Mary or anyone in this household . " <p> Sniffling into my uncle 's handkerchief , I tried to embrace Will 's optimism , but it was no easy task . <p> Maman is dead . I will never see her again . <p> As if he sensed my thoughts , Will stood and pulled me to my feet . " Come , Jane . No one can take the place of a mother , but here you have brothers and sisters , in spirit if not in blood . The children of honor look out for each other . " <p> His words did make me feel a little better . " Are the prince and princesses our brother and sisters , too ? " <p> Will slung an arm around my shoulders and steered me toward the palace . " Indeed they are , Sister Jane ... except that they must be catered to at all costs . " Copyright 2009 by Kathy Lynn Emerson <br> Continues ...                  @ @ @
