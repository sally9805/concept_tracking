Twenty-five years after the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and the Department of Agriculture began issuing dietary guidelines to keep us healthy and fit , nearly two-thirds of Americans have become overweight or obese . So in the 2005 edition of the guidelines  --  on which school lunch menus are based  --  the HHS Secretary toughened the message , providing specific limits on fat and salt and urging us to eat our vegetables and exercise regularly . <P> What to Eat and Do <P> FRUITS AND VEGETABLES Five servings of fruits and vegetables a day  --  the old standard  --  are n't enough anymore if you want to maintain good nutrition and prevent disease . The new goal is nine servings of about half a cup each , split between four servings of fruit per day and five of vegetables or legumes . <P> WHOLE GRAIN Look for whole kernels of wheat or other grains in your bread and cereals . Whole-grain goods are packed with more nutrients than bagels , white bread or cakes and muffins made from refined flours . <P> EXERCISE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardening for at least 30 min. most days of the week .
