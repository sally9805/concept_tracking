<p> The wilting white-and-purple bouquet in Carlos Gviniashvili 's hand is all the evidence he needs that this once-hopeful nation has hit rock bottom . " I do n't want to sell these flowers , " says the retired veterinarian , whose complaints are echoed widely across this former Soviet republic . " I had an income , I had a job ... Now I have to sell flowers to buy bread for my family . " Hard luck stories may be common across the fledgling states created by the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union . But the dramatic decline in living standards in the Caucasus nation of Georgia - once one of the most prosperous patches on the Soviet map , and an area with many advantages as it entered into independence - form a case study in the difficulties of creating a new society from the Soviet past . Georgia has received $ 1 billion in American aid in the past decade , making it among the top handful of recipients per capita of US aid . But Georgians say they have seen little result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old-style leadership and what they call a " law-breaking mentality " have all conspired to block the creation of a prosperous civil society . The first moves toward stopping the graft and decay could be taken this week , however : Georgia is considering a raft of long-overdue anticorruption measures put forward by an American-funded Georgian commission . If Georgian President Edvard Shevardnadze signs the anticorruption decree , it could bring new accountability to Georgian political and economic life , and - theoretically , at least - begin chipping away at privileges that foster corruption . Preliminary measures Government office expenditures would be posted publicly , and inspectors could question owners of luxury cars about tax payments . Special license plate numbers , which denote a privileged class and create public resentment - could disappear for police , officials and other elite groups . Efforts would be made to stop traffic police shakedowns of motorists . " It 's of crucial importance , " says David Usupashvili , the US-educated lawyer who heads the anticorruption commission , which drafted the current , preliminary measures and a much broader framework to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US Agency for International Development , and other American donors is funding the eight-month program ; European donors are expected to cover the bulk of future costs of a permanent watchdog commission . " If Shevardnadze signs the decree , it will be a clear signal that he will go with the whole program , " Mr. Usupashvili says . " If he delays , cynicism is growing . " The pessimism in Georgia today is a far cry from the early 1990s euphoria of independence . As living standards have fallen , tension has risen . Electricity is scarcer every winter . Demonstrators took to the streets last November in protest over chronic power cuts , erecting barricades and burning tires . One popular joke asks : " What did Georgians use for light before candles ? " Answer : " Electricity . " In the past three years , Mr. Gviniashvili , the flower seller , has received just one pension payment - the equivalent of $ 6 . " I blame Shevardnadze , " says Gviniashvili . " It 's like a family : If something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may be the target of popular blame , analysts say that Shevardnadze is , in fact , godfather of the two trends that have defined post-Soviet Georgia : Western largesse and Georgian corruption . As the Soviet foreign minister who presided over the peaceful breakup of the Soviet Union , he won Western gratitude in the form of top-dollar support . Georgia was also part of an American strategy to create a buffer against Russian influence . But in coping with the first years of independence - marred by a civil war , two breakaway regions , and lawlessness - Shevardnadze , who has survived two assassination attempts , was forced to make deals with an unsavory militia chief and other shadowy elements . Shevardnadze was reelected last April in a vote that was widely seen as rigged , which further soured the public mood . " Shevardnadze really did save the Georgian state , but he could only do so on the basis of the former Soviet elite , which was completely corrupt , " says Anatol Lieven , a senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 or so anticorruption measures now on the president 's desk , while preliminary , are being seen as a key to Georgia 's economic future and government credibility . Big money , small results Aid to Georgia has been spent on everything from training the judiciary , reforming the military , and bolstering the border police force to soup kitchens and a wave of expensive Western consultants . There are signs of progress , but they appear small compared with the money spent . Mr. Lieven says " some good " has been done , especially with the border guards , court system , and antipoverty programs . Many new laws have been passed . But " nothing " has been done to improve infrastructure , he says , and " money to the Army seems to have been completely wasted . " " It 's not like past lending to Russia , which disappeared en bloc , " Lieven adds . " This is lots and lots of programs , and every one is being continually sapped by corruption . That adds up to an awful lot of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as donors at the poor result . " We were all optimists and thought we would be like Holland , maybe live even better than the West , " says Vakhtang Shamiladze , a senior Georgian lawmaker . " Politicians thought they would sign a document , and we would live in a democracy the next day . But the dreams and reality did n't correspond . " You in the West wanted fast integration ; we wanted it , too , " he adds . " It 's also your problem : You should not give money without better control . " Most ex-Soviet republics are finding the transition from seven decades of central rule and command economy difficult . Western officials acknowledge that their hopes were too high . Today , by all accounts , projects are more focused . " When the Soviet Union collapsed , no one realized what a mess it was , or how distorted the economy was , " says a Western diplomat in Tbilisi . " There was also a misunderstanding on both sides of what outside assistance could do , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term , nation-building view is necessary to gauge success . " It 's not enough to pass a law . You can take people to the West , and translate democratic ideas into beautiful Georgian . But someone must implement them . " Breaking old habits Rooting out corruption in Georgia will require changing a Soviet-era mentality . Breaking the law was for decades a form of rebellion against Moscow . Georgia , which occupied a special place in the Soviet economy by providing wine and fruit to the rest of the empire , had a reputation as the most corrupt republic , and those who cheated the " system " based in faraway Moscow were treated as heroes . " There were always ways around the rules , to cheat the law . People invested their whole life into trying to prove they do n't abide by any regulation , because rules came from the other side of the universe , " says George Khutsishvili , director of the International Center on Conflict and Negotiation in Tbilisi . " Now we are building our own society , but people still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe in law or rules . We are trying to develop a civil society , but they do n't care . " Some observers say they see positive signs when comparing Georgia to other ex-Soviet republics such as Belarus or Uzbekistan . " Wherever you go , there are police states with heavy-handed bureaucracies . Compared to those , Georgia is an oasis of democracy , " says Georgy Tarkhan-Mouravi , head of the independent Center for Geopolitical and Regional Studies in Tbilisi . The flood of cash from the US and West " was not a totally failed investment , " he adds . " If there was no American money , people would be starving years ago . If we have economic stability , that is thanks to the US and leads to political stability . Without that , we would have turned to Russia . " Still , many Georgians say they want better from their government , and want to see that their president is serious about confronting corruption . " When you enter the 21st century without lights ... and you see what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go is up , " says Irina Sarishvili-Chanturia , head of the opposition National Democratic Party and a former deputy . " But we have to shift quite serious resources from pockets to budgets , and reconstruct our mentality . We 're not used to having this country as our own . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 .
