Bye , Roger . I 'm off to the airport , " I said to my husband one Tuesday morning in March . ( I 've decided to begin the story here because it 's the morning I became aware that I wanted to kill Roger . Well , not kill him , exactly . Just slap him around a little . ) " Roger ? " There was no response from him . Not even the slightest flicker . It was as if he were alone in our three-bedroom house on the corner of fifteenth and Idaho in Santa Monica , as if he did n't have a wife of six years who was about to leave on a business trip , as if he had morphed from a husband who takes his marital responsibilities seriously into a husband who takes his marital responsibilities for granted . Such a shame , was n't it ? Especially after our dreamy start on that freeway ? " Roger , " I tried again . " I said goodbye . " He was sitting at the kitchen counter , reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English muffin . There were crumbs everywhere , including those pesky little seeds that regularly slough off the underside of English muffins . I was itching to grab the nearest Dustbuster , but there was n't time . I was running late . The Town Car from Ascot Limo was picking me up any minute to take me to LAX . " Oh , are you going now , hon ? " he said sweetly , innocently , turning his head in my direction at last , answering with a mouthful of food . His question sounded more like Ohyougonaha ? I often thought of hiring a translator for those precious moments when Roger spoke while he ate . " Yes . I 'm taking a nine o'clock flight , remember ? " I had only told him that ten thousand times . " When will you be back ? " " Thursday night , " I replied impatiently . I had told him that too . I 'd told him where I was going and what time I was going and when I would be home , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we were first married , he hung on my every word , not to mention hung up his clothes , and now he did neither . He was always too busy , too tired , too something , and , as a result , I was always carping . " I really wish you 'd listen to me when I talk to you , Roger . " He took a sip of coffee . Slurped it , actually . A renegade drop dribbled down the side of his mug onto the counter . I hated how tempted I was to wipe it up . " And I really wish you would n't go off on a trip on such a harsh note , " he countered . " Besides , I do listen to you when you talk to me . I 'm allowed to forget the details , are n't I ? " He honestly did n't get it , did n't get the disconnect that had occurred between us . Or if he did , he did n't want to face itor , God forbid , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the details , " I said wistfully . " Sorry , hon. You know how tied up with work I 've been . " Tied up with work . Ha ! Roger had become a card-carrying workaholic . When we were first married , he could n't wait to get away from the office so he could be with me . Now , the reverse was true , or at least it seemed that way . " Is it really work , Roger ? " I said . " Is that what 's distracting you ? Or is it that the thrill is gone ? That our marriage is in trouble ? " " Elizabeth . Do n't start that again . " " Why not ? You 've changed . I ca n't help that I notice it . " " I have n't changed . It 's just ... just ... I do n't know ... reality , I guess . People get bogged down by the routine of marriage , the everyday-ness of marriage , the blah-blah-blah of going to the office and dealing with the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbors over . It ca n't be the way it was when we were first married . It never is . " " That 's not true . There are plenty of couples who 've been married a long time but act like they 're still on their honeymoon . " " Name one . " I thought for a minute , taking a quick inventory of all our friends , many of whom were no longer our friends because they 'd gotten divorced , remarried , and moved on to other friends . " I ca n't . Not right this second . But that does n't mean there are n't any . " " Elizabeth . " He said this with a patronizing tone . " I appreciate that you have high standards and demand the best of everything and everybody , but marriage is n't a honeymoon . It is n't supposed to be . " " I do n't believe that . I refuse to believe that . Maybe what 's really going on between us is that you 're having an affair . " First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the eyebrow arch . Then , he did that thing people do with their neck where they sort of extend it forward and hold it there , to register their shock and disbeliefand buy time . " Nice stall , " I said . " I 'm not stalling , " he said . " I 'm just stunned by your question . I 'm processing it . " " What 's to process ? A yes or no will do . " " Elizabeth . What 's gotten into you ? " He shook his head , so as to indicate that he thought I was emotionally unstable . " Of course I 'm not . " " Not what ? " " Having an affair , for God 's sake ! " " Would you tell me if you were ? " " Okay , stop this . " He put his hand up , like a school crossing guard . His palm was smudged with newsprint . His fingertips were glistening with margarine . The cuff of his shirt revealed a small coffee stain . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hose him down . I 'm sorry I did n't remember what time your flight is leaving this morning . I 'm sorry I did n't remember when you 're scheduled to come home . I 'm sorry if you feel I have n't been as attentive as I should be . But I am not having an affair . I am in love with my wife . And I would appreciate it if she would let me finish my breakfast . " " Sure . Okay . Fine . " The truth is , I did n't really suspect him of having an affair , despite my accusation . When men have affairs , they generally dress spiffier , log in more time at the gym , wear too much cologne . Roger , on the other hand , had slacked off in the area of his personal grooming . Remember the lean and rangy guy who 'd rescued me on the 405 ? Well , sorry to report that he had sprouted baby jowls , not to mention an actual gut . Plus , the hair on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to grow , and do n't even get me started on his hopelessly dated wardrobe . No , I did n't think he was cheating on me . I was just trying to be provocative in an effort to shake him up , get him juiced , snap him out of his coma , rekindle his old spark . I would have been devastated if he 'd admitted he 'd been sleeping around . He 'd been acting like a clod lately , but he was my clod . " I love you too , you know , " I said out loud , inching my way over to him . " That 's why it hurts me so much that we 've drifted apart . " " We have n't drifted apart . I 'm right here , hon. " He smiled , showing off the dimpled grin that had made me weak-kneed at our first meeting . " If we have n't drifted apart , then why does it feel as if we 're just going through the motions ? " I said . " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I knew relationships went through stages , passages , whatever you want to call them ; that the adrenaline rush did n't last forever . But I was n't ready to forfeit excitement for contentment . Not yet , anyway . " We 're not drifting apart and we 're not going through the motions and we communicate as well as can be expected , " said Roger . " As well as can be expected ? What 's that supposed to mean ? " I said , my stomach twisting as it always did when we fought . He swatted the newspaper at some invisible bug . " Do n't put me on the defensive , Elizabeth . I hate when you do that . " " Then tell me what you meant by that last remark . " " Nothing . Let 's just forget I said it . " I was about to argue that I could n't forget it and why should I forget it and once people say something it 's too late to take it back , but I heard the doorbell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to go . I 'll call you when I get to Seattle . " " Right . " " Right ? Is that the best you can do ? What if my plane crashes and right turns out to be your final word to me ? Is that your idea of communication , Roger ? Is it ? Because I remember a time when you said beautiful words to mewords full of poetry and depth and intimacy . What happened to them , huh ? Tell me that , if you can . " I had become unhinged and it was unattractive of me , but the guy was making me nuts . " Elizabeth . " Roger extended his hand to me . " What ? " " Come here . " " Why ? " " Because I do n't think you should leave like this . " " How should I leave then ? " " By walking over here and letting me kiss you goodbye . " Letting himoh , well , why not , I figured , surprised and delighted that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had said " kiss , " so my assumption was that our lips would make contact and that our tongues might even get involved . For a couple who had n't had sex in months , that was pretty hot stuff . " Roger , " I murmured , my voice softening , my body relaxing . I sidled up to him , rubbed his thigh , and puckered up . " Travel safely , hon , " he said , then deposited a dry little peck on my cheek . Yeah , on my cheek . How about that for heat , huh ? Now , do you see what I 'm talking about ? Where was the passion ? The lust ? The saliva ? Where was the man who was so demonstrative when we were in the throes of our courtship ? The man who claimed I turned him on , rang his chimes , lit his fire ? The man who was so gallant , so chivalrous , so endearing the day he picked me up on that damn freeway ? Was he still in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by somebody 's old-fart uncle ? He was only forty at that pointjust two years my senior and hardly ready to be carted off to an assisted living facility . So where was the guy I married ? How was I going to save him ? How was I going to save us ?
