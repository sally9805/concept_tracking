Wall Street would love to see Eliot Spitzer realize his immediate political ambitions  --  becoming , say , Governor of New York or possibly landing a role in a Kerry Administration . Not that financial types wish him well ; they just wish he would move on . As New York 's attorney general , Spitzer , 44 , has pushed through reform of stock-research and investment-banking practices , lobbied for a reduction in mutual-fund fees and left a trail of disgraced executives in his wake . Spitzer carved another notch in his belt last week . After drawn-out negotiations , Richard Strong , the former chief executive of Strong Capital Management , agreed to pay a $60 million fine and accept a lifetime ban from the securities industry to settle charges of improper trading . Spitzer will be at it again this week . He 's expected to file a lawsuit seeking to force former New York Stock Exchange ( N.Y.S.E. ) chief Richard Grasso to return most of the $140 million in accrued pay he received shortly before resigning under pressure last year . <P> Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the 10 cases that Spitzer is personally working on . His caseload is n't entirely about corporate wrongdoing . He 's also challenging a federal attempt to pre-empt states from enforcing predatory-lending laws , and a few months ago won a ruling that forced the Bush Administration to reverse its rollback of pollution regulations that applied to big utilities . " The EPA U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cases are huge , " he says . But Spitzer clearly sees Wall Street as his bailiwick ; an avid and aggressive tennis player , he keeps a tennis ball with the Merrill Lynch logo on it , occasionally palming it as he chats . The crush of activity in his office speaks volumes about how much opportunity presents itself for someone who makes it a personal crusade to clean up the business world . <P> Certainly , the run of greed-inspired scandals beginning in 2001 with Enron has brought about meaningful changes . The accounting industry now has a federally chartered oversight board . Stock analysts are no longer permitted to shill for investment bankers at road shows . Bankers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a corporate chaperone listening in , and e-mails between their departments automatically bounce back . The compensation committees of public companies must now be composed of independent directors , reducing the chances for cronyism . There 's legal basis for forcing executives to give back bonuses when accounting fraud is proved . Mutual-fund fees are coming down . And the Grasso flap is riveting attention on the thorniest issue of them all , one that seems unlikely to be resolved in a definitive way : Just how much is a CEO worth ? <P> In a sense , Spitzer is taking on the whole clubby system that keeps driving CEO pay higher . Boards stacked with cronies too often still rubber-stamp excessively rich packages . In most cases , CEO pay is a question not of what is legal but of what is right . " The nature of CEO compensation is something that deserves additional scrutiny . One of the things that will emerge from the Grasso investigation , " he says , " is the failure of compensation committees to fulfill their obligations . " The Grasso case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the people who approved his payout in the first place .
