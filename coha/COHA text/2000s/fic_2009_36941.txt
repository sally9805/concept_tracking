Moydenshire Summer 1195 <p> If hell were a place on earth , this might be it . <p> His right hand on his sword 's hilt , Aldwin stood in the shadows of an oak tree outside the Raging Bull Tavern . The night breeze whispered , and , with his free hand , he yanked his cloak sleeve over his nose to quell the stench wafting from the stable a few yards away . The foul odor , combined with the smoke hissing from the wet logs on the fire outside the tavern ... Whew . <p> Blinking against the smoky breeze , he focused on the laughter and voices carrying out into the night from the run-down tavern . Orange-yellow light poked out from the cracked wattle-and-daub walls , streaking into the blackness like wisps of hair , giving the place the air of a strumpet desperately past her prime who struggled to still appear comely . <p> A roar erupted from the drunkards by the fire , who had not yet noticed him . Smoke snaked up around the group of mostly farmers and peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None looked likely to possess the priceless ruby pendant he sought for his lord , Geoffrey de Lanceau . Still ... <p> " Oy ! I asked ye ta move aside , " one of the drunkards groused . <p> The teetering man beside him sneered . The two exchanged punches . <p> " Bets ! Bets , " another sot yelled over the fighters ' pained grunts . <p> The others cheered . <p> " God 's blood , " Aldwin muttered . All he needed was to face a bloody brawl . " Get the pendant and leave as quickly as possible , " de Lanceau had instructed at Branton Keep days ago , his steel-gray gaze grim . " The fewer who know of the missing jewel , the better . " Glancing away , his eyes shadowed with remorse . " I can not disappoint my lady wife , Aldwin . Not when she endured such a difficult birthing to give me a beautiful daughter . Not when for weeks I promised my love a wondrous gift . " <p> " I understand , milord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't change . While Aldwin wondered if his lordship had heard him speak , de Lanceau 's face contorted with loathing . " As you know , the man who was to deliver the jewel to me from London is missing . I have heard whispers that Baron Sedgewick of Avenley and that conniving bitch , Veronique , are in this part of England . I do no doubt they will try to undermine my rule . They will destroy me for thwarting their murderous plans to seize control of Moydenshire years ago , and do all they can to hurt my family . If they were to come into possession of the pendant ... " <p> The way his lord 's words trailed off to silence made cold sweat bead on Aldwin 's brow . All too well he knew of the baron 's evil , manipulative nature ; because of the baron 's lies , Aldwin had fired a crossbow bolt into de Lanceau 's chest three years ago , after the battle at Wode . He 'd almost killed his lordship , a mistake Aldwin sorely regretted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he completed this mission for his lord , might he at last be awarded knighthood ? How Aldwin longed to become one of de Lanceau 's knights . To finally rise above the dishonor blemishing his past . <p> " Veronique and the baron will not get the jewel , milord , " Aldwin vowed . " I will do what I must to bring it safely to you , as you ordered . " <p> De Lanceau 's harsh gaze locked with his . Nodding , he said , " Take as many men-at-arms as you wish . Horses , weapons- " <p> " I go alone . " <p> " Alone ? " De Lanceau frowned . " We do not know who sent word of the pendant to me here at Branton Keep . " <p> " By going alone , I rouse fewer suspicions , " Aldwin said . <p> " I will not have you fall prey to a trap . " <p> The concern in de Lanceau 's voice twisted Aldwin 's gut . To think he had almost killed this honorable man who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well capable of defending myself , milord . Moreover , if this missive is a ruse , the sender-or senders-will be expecting a convoy of armed riders . Not a lone man who will slip into their midst , seize the pendant , and vanish . " <p> A faint smile touched de Lanceau 's mouth . " Very well . If you are not back within four days , I will send my army to find you . " <p> " I will not fail you , milord . " <p> De Lanceau 's hand tightened into a fist . " You must not . Many lives may depend on your success . Including my own . " <p> A cry snapped Aldwin 's attention back to the blazing fire . Four men were fighting now . Glancing at the two-story building , he mentally catalogued the entrances and exits , and then strode from the tree 's concealing shadows . <p> Skirting the fighters , he headed toward the tavern door . Smoke gusted around him , stinging his eyes . His garments would reek of smoke for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door handle , no more than three weathered bits of wood hammered together . <p> Before his fingers connected with the handle , the door flew open with the creak of rusty hinges . Light and bawdy cheers flared out into the night as a pock-faced drunkard staggered out . Aldwin slipped past him into the dimly lit interior . <p> The stench-bodies gone unwashed for months , rotting food scraps mashed into the dirt floor , and an ill-vented fire-made his stomach roil . Narrowing his watery eyes , he dragged a hand over his face to ward off a sneeze and sauntered forward . Somewhere in this wretched place was the person who 'd hand over the pendant . <p> Or , as de Lanceau warned , a trap . <p> Aldwin scanned the room , lit by a fire in the opposite hall and candles crammed into holders . Heading toward the crowded bar , he indulged in a smile . Any man who thought to attack him would be in for hard fighting . <p> As he neared , several men leaned away from the wooden bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrubbing the top with a grubby rag , glanced up . His gaze settled on Aldwin 's sword and his fat mouth quivered , as though he wondered why Aldwin had set foot inside his premises . <p> " A drink , milord ? " the bar owner said . Sweat dotted his forehead , a sign of a guilty conscience . Did he believe Aldwin had come to demand an unpaid debt ? Or , mayhap the lout was in on a trap . <p> " In a moment . " Aldwin stood at the best vantage point to assess the room and the tavern door . <p> " Just let me know . " The man managed a nervous smile before mopping his face with his rag . " I will have yer drink right up . " <p> Aldwin nodded his thanks . Chairs scraped across the room . Two men broke into raucous laughter , while a strumpet , squeezed into a linen gown , sidled toward a group of men motioning her over to them . She had a lovely figure ; however , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother . <p> " Hardly a wench for you , I would say , " said a male close by . <p> Aldwin discerned amusement in the low , faintly gravelly voice . His gaze slid to the wiry man standing beside the bar , who barely reached Aldwin 's shoulder . With uncombed , shoulder-length gray hair , a pointed nose , and bright blue eyes , the man resembled a creature yanked from books of lore . <p> A silent groan rumbled in Aldwin 's throat . The last thing he wanted was to be drawn into senseless conversation . Foolish chatter could prove a deadly distraction . A knife through his back , before he even sensed an assailant . <p> Distracting him could be the man 's purpose . <p> " Excuse me . " Aldwin pushed away from the bar . <p> The old man 's hand shot out . His gnarled fingers-surprisingly strong-clenched Aldwin 's cloak sleeve . " The woman you desire- " <p> Aldwin glared at the old man . <p> " - has lips as red as rubies . " <p> Aldwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man might not know about the pendant . His words might simply be a coincidence . <p> " Rubies , " Aldwin repeated with a faint smile . " She sounds most tempting . " <p> An answering grin tipped the man 's mouth , revealing the gap between his front teeth . He looked like a cheeky gnome . " Aye , milord , but she is . " He winked . " Exquisite . " <p> Anticipation tingled at the base of Aldwin 's skull . Either the man was trying to sell him the services of a whore-for an extortionate price he 'd soon reveal-or he was indicating he had information on de Lanceau 's pendant . In either case , Aldwin had better not appear overly excited . <p> Pointedly glancing down at the wizened hand clenched into his cloak , Aldwin said , " I am intrigued , old man . I would like to see this ... prize . " <p> The little man beamed . Dipping his wild gray head , he said , " I hoped you would . " He withdrew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of encouragement . " Follow me . " <p> * * * <p> Leona stood in the tavern 's shadowed back room , sipping a mug of ale . Bitter , watered-down rot , but at least it dulled her nerves . <p> Tipping her head back , she downed another mouthful , cringed , and then set the chipped earthenware mug on the window ledge , next to the lit candle . She pulled her waist-length braid over her shoulder and fiddled with the leather thong . She should be doing something-anything-other than pacing this grimy room that smelled of damp kegs and moldy flour sacks . <p> Yet , she would wait . <p> When the knocks came upon the door , she must be ready . <p> Sir Theodore Wrenleigh-Twig , she 'd affectionately called him since childhood because he reminded her of a spindly tree-had slipped out some time ago , promising to report back as soon as he had any news . His fellow man-at-arms , Sir Reginald Themdale , would stand watch in the corridor outside . <p> " Milady , wait here . Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to stop her objections before she 'd uttered one word . " ' T is a rough crowd in the main room . Not at all the place for you . " <p> " Twig- " <p> He 'd slapped his scrawny fist to the front of his cloak , his expression solemn . " Milady , these are unusual circumstances , and I am a man of my word . I made a promise before we left Pryerston Keep . I would rather cut off my own toes than see you come to harm . " <p> Leona sighed at the memory . Dear , kindhearted Twig . Overprotective , irritating Twig . She should have brushed past him , slipped out into the corridor , and headed to a shadowed corner of the tavern , where she 'd help keep watch for the man de Lanceau sent to collect the pendant . No one would recognize her as a noblewoman , hidden by the ragged cloak that covered her from head to ankle . Moreover , she was no fragile maiden who depended upon others to defend her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when shouting erupted in the main tavern . <p> " If ill befalls you , " Twig had said quietly , " who will care for Pryerston ? " <p> Sadness deepened his voice and , in that moment , the defiance inside her had melted away . For he spoke true . Her father , drunk every day since her mother 's tragic death that past spring , could barely tend to his own needs . Leona had had no choice but to take over running the keep , working alongside the servants and seeing to the necessary decisions , asking , however , that her efforts be kept a secret . As lord , her sire deserved his subjects ' respect ; he was still the castle 's ruler . <p> That is , before the baron and Veronique arrived . <p> Thinking about them roused a surge of fury so intense , she 'd clenched her teeth . " Very well . I 'll wait . " <p> Twig had smiled in that gallant way of his . " Thank you . " And then he and Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Turning around , she paced back across the floor , past empty ale barrels and a wooden crate stacked with candles . While run down , the tavern-located roughly halfway between Branton and Pryerston keeps-was the perfect site to trade the stolen pendant for the reward de Lanceau offered . Paying a traveling musician to deliver the missive she 'd written about the exchange was Twig 's idea , and a good one , for the man had no connection to Pryerston . <p> She 'd never met de Lanceau , but from all she 'd heard , he was no fool . If she 'd sent one of the keep 's servants , he or she would have been promptly arrested , questioned , and forced to reveal how the jewel came to be at Pryerston . As much as Leona wanted to be rid of the pendant , she would n't risk implicating her father as a traitor . <p> Moreover , she reminded herself , the offered reward money was desperately needed to replenish Pryerston 's coffers so overdue repairs could begin about the keep . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy Adeline , the young daughter of Pryerston 's cook , specially made shoes to help straighten her legs bowed from her difficult birth . In time , Adeline would walk without hobbling , and would run as fast and well as other girls her age . <p> Some of Leona 's happiest memories were of racing Ward through the meadows near Pryerston . What child-peasant or noble born-would n't want that freedom ? <p> Crash . Leona jumped at the sound , which came from the main part of the tavern . She swiveled on the heel of her worn leather boots and retraced her steps , hoping Twig would n't be too much longer . <p> Oh , Father . No matter what you have done , I still love you . <p> Two knocks rattled the chamber door . <p> The signal . <p> Leona 's hand instinctively flew to her bosom . Her fingers brushed the oval-shaped ruby , about the size of a robin 's egg and set in a delicate gold framework , hidden beneath her garments . The jewel hung on a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen chemise . Safe against her bare skin . The pendant could n't be snatched without her knowledge . <p> Or consent . <p> Two more knocks , slightly louder . <p> De Lanceau 's man was approaching . <p> Her pulse became a drumming thunder . She longed to draw the dagger from her right boot , for an extra measure of security , but de Lanceau 's man might interpret that as a threat . She did n't want any misunderstandings to delay the exchange . <p> With trembling fingers , she checked the hood of her cloak , drawing it as far down as possible to fully conceal her face . Perspiration moistened her palms . Her legs shook , as they had that summer day when she stood on the forest pool 's rocky edge , trying to ignore her brother 's teasing while she prepared to jump into the deep water , even though she was n't sure she could swim to shore . <p> Footsteps sounded outside the door . Fabric brushed against the rough-hewn panel . <p> Leona drew a steadying breath . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you , and will not let you destroy your life . <p> The door creaked inward . Hazy light spilled across the dirt floor . <p> Straggly-haired Twig stood in the doorway . Behind him , his hand poised to draw his sword , Sir Reginald stared at someone just out of her view . <p> Twig set his hand to his brow-he obviously tried to make her out in the dim room-before he bowed and strode in . " This way , " he said , motioning for the person following him to enter . <p> Leona buried her unsteady hands in the folds of her cloak as bold footfalls sounded behind Twig . A tall man dominated the space outside the door , his right boot a hair 's breadth from the threshold . One hand on his sheathed sword , he glanced inside , then scrutinized Sir Reginald , before looking back into the shadowed room . <p> Misgiving tingled through her . He was familiar , somehow . She could n't quite say why . <p> His gaze shifted , like a hawk assessing the landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . His cloak 's hood covered the crown of his head , yet his blond hair grew long enough to slip from the gaps where his hood met his shoulder . No doubt he preferred a full , unhindered view of his surroundings , for his face was n't concealed . <p> He took another step forward , causing light to fall upon his features . <p> What a face ... <p> Austere . Beautiful . A visage so handsome , she 'd remember it for the rest of her days . Angular cheekbones and a strong jaw were offset by his slender , noble nose . His eyes were blue . Not the warm blue of a young , inexperienced fighter eager to please his lord , but the frosty blue of a winter sky . A warrior 's gaze hardened by cunning and resolve . <p> When his head tilted , and his attention slid to the far corner of the room , she recognized traces of someone she knew . <p> When they were children . <p> Her breath caught , as if his cold stare pierced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could this man be someone other than Aldwin ? <p> She had n't seen him since the accident years ago . Had n't wanted to see him ever again . Heard of him , aye . Who did n't know the popular chanson de geste telling of the great battle in which he shot Lord Geoffrey de Lanceau with a crossbow bolt from many yards away ? The almost impossible shot was recounted with awe and horror . Most men would have died from such a wound , but ' t was said de Lanceau 's true love for Lady Elizabeth Brackendale gave him the strength of spirit to overcome his grave wound and live . <p> The chanson was all she 'd known of Aldwin through the years . <p> Until today , when their lives had touched again . <p> Her mind reeled , resurrecting hurt and anger from years ago . Being bound to the tree . The bee stings . The river . <p> As though sensing the shock welling inside her , the man 's gaze settled upon her . Standing at the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hood covering her features , Leona doubted he could make out her face . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
