KIRITH HAD NOT BEEN MEANT to ride the wind : I was sure of it . All living things must ride it someday , the Loreweavers said . The old and the sick rode the wind , as did the great yellow leaves in the dry season when their edges frayed and they could no longer hold onto the limbs ; but Kirith had been my age , barely grown to adulthood . <p> We saw the wind take her , as she crossed the vine bridge toward us from that slender , leaning trunk which people call the Gray Dawn . It was the Quiet Wind that pulled her through the vines ; not any of the soft or raging sideways breezes that can be felt on the skin . It was the Quiet Wind , the one that blows forever downward , in the crownglades and flathomes , indoors and out , silent and absolutely unceasing . <p> She did not choose to ride it . Her screams , her stretching arms told us that . One moment she had been moving forward at a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rungs ; the next , she was whirling , crashing through woven shade canopies , diminishing in the blue-green vaults below . Dust filtered down , flashing in afternoon rays . For a long time after she was gone , none of us could speak . We could only stare after her . <p> The Quiet Wind had taken my flute once , when my age was no more than seven or eight sun-seasons . I remembered how the wind stole it from the fork where I had propped it , and how I watched it roll and bounce away , never to be returned ; and how I had wept for it , for no flute is exactly like any other . That was how the wind bore Kirith away . <p> I kept silence while the people mourned for her as they would for an old one , a sick one . It was a strange sending , for there was no still , sleeping body to wrap in leaves and give to the wind ; this time the wind had not received , but taken . I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twisted , leaning Gray Dawn . Listening to the mourning songs , I peered down through the jagged hole into the misty void , where sunlight slanted pale and faltering , where leaf upon leaf hid that impossibly distant Place of Roots , to which even most of the Loreweavers had never been . <p> I touched the shattered rungs , rubbed my thumb over the sun faded ends that had given way . They were as yielding as the dry grasses that grew from bark - left too long without replacing , overlooked , since this was a little-traveled path beside a stouter mainway . Worms had eaten the wood in places ; I saw the circling , haphazard grooves they had bored on the rungs ' undersides . <p> Kirith was gone from her flathome because of forgotten maintenance , because of worms . It had not been her time . There was no rightness in this , no harmony , and I had no peace . Even when the last sending song 's echoes had vanished , when children laughed again and harvesters clambered over the trellises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of the family we might have raised together . I broke off branches , hurled them as far as I could upward across the glades , watched as that unfelt downward stream took each one . " Our mothers teach us to fear you , " I said to the Quiet Wind . " Nothing that has breath may be given to you . What belongs to you is that from which breath is gone . Why have you taken what was not yet yours ? " <p> The wise ones told me , " Kirith is happier now . " Even her mother said so . " She is in the Glades of the Sun , where there is no wind at all , where fruit ripens in every season and need not be tended . The dreams that rise from the Place of Roots to trouble our sleep never rise there . " <p> I considered the wise Loreweavers ' words ; I tried to imagine Kirith in the Other Trees , light falling golden on her hair . The dry season came with its yellowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the seed season filled the air with uncountable soft , drifting tufts , each a seed that would nestle in a fork or on a broad , mossy branch and become another trunk . Rains came next , sometimes whispering , sometimes roaring , washing the new leaves to gleam in another season of sun . But Kirith was not here to make garlands of the earliest white flowers , those that glistened in the cool hollows of the old , wind-eaten trunks . <p> Pushing my face close to one such dim grotto , I remembered the rotten rungs of the bridge . There were worms here , too , devouring the wood , their fat bodies wriggling in the pulp that was no longer wood . This season the worms angered me , and I did that which I had never done , nor ever seen done by anyone : I crushed them under my hands , grinding them into the hard wall , painting the rough bark with the soft slime they became . Then I fell to the moss , my arms slick to the elbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . In the stillness of the ancient Evening Fork , the vast trunks of Day and Night rising on either side of me , I heard Kirith 's voice in the splash of the stream , in the sighing of moss curtains . And I could not tell whether she sang , faint and far away , or whether she wept . <p> When I rose , my limbs stiff and aching , I knew what I must do . I must follow the Quiet Wind in the direction it had carried her . If she was lost in the Place of Roots far below , unable to climb the trunks , then I must find her . No one , I was sure , would give me a blessing for such a journey , not to that sun-forsaken region from which the night 's visions crept . <p> So on the next morning of gathering , when each with his or her basket would range far from the flathomes in search of the ripening longfruit , I stuffed my belt 's pouch with nuts , dried berry cakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . I circled away from my brothers , following the hub of bound branches past the Vineglade and Voss 's Fence . Beyond sight of the others , I wedged my basket in an old restfork , where seats polished by generations of passersby lay cradled in aromatic bowers of starbloom . <p> Then I descended . Hand over hand , by vines , by overgrown trellises , by the steps cut in mighty boles , I departed from the airy realm . The leaves became fewer as I went down - fewer and darker , larger , like heavy cloaks abandoned on hooked limbs . To sleep , I shared the knothole cave of a twitching silicus , his beard grown long and tangled . He raised drooping eyelids to regard me , then rolled to his other side , covered his face with twiggy paws , and continued his fidgeting slumber . Night fell darker here , where starlight did not penetrate , where the moon peered for the briefest span through a gap high above . <p> Morning was scarcely brighter , a gray suffusion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon . The last leaves gave place to oily vines , their ominous loops thicker than four people could join hands around . There were no steps or carvings here ; I made my way by braided trunks , by the natural stairways of arches upon arches . Always I was mindful of the Quiet Wind , which tugged at my ankles on the slippery paths , threatening to pluck me from the trees and make me ride . The fragrance of new growth was gone , and all the world seemed damp , dripping , and tainted . Worms must be here , writhing and chewing beneath every surface . That night I shivered in the open , unwilling to clamber inside any of the odorous holes , afraid of what might lurk in their depths . I scarcely slept , listening to the ticking and scratching of creatures I could not see , things for which I knew no names . <p> The next dawn was no dawn at all , but the merest paling of the gloom that just allowed me to pick a creeping course down trunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . Their ravaged walls peeled in outthrust runners large as platforms , the route faintly lighted by glowing , bulbous growths . Some shelves let my feet plunge through , left me dangling waist deep in bark above the void . Half-glimpsed shapes of unsettling lengths and proportions scuttled away from me , and a dank humidity arose to soak my garments . Vapors formed a hedge so solid that the sounds of my breathing bounced back loud . <p> Near the journey 's end , when my head spun with weariness and the all-pervading stench , the descent became easier . What I supposed at first to be enormous limbs shot out from the boles , dove in sprawling nets of chaos into a mire of blackness . As I eased gratefully onto the uppermost of these sloping paths , I realized the livid carpet beneath me was the endless flat surface from which all trees grow , and that I stood upon those anchoring nether appendages of the trees themselves . I had come to the Place of Roots . <p> Lower I hurried now , slipping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooded stalks ; lower and lower , until the midnight morass rose to meet me , until I came level with the grotesque caves beneath the roots . <p> Glinting in the pallid light on every side , under every tree marching away into oblivion , rose jumbled mounds of whitish branches ... branches , I thought , and yet nowhere could I see any of a form or texture I knew . They linked together , interlocked , some fastened at the ends by gray or brownish cords . I crept to the edge of the nearest heap , overwhelmed by its size . Here , in the first such mound alone , lay more of these age-old things than there were leaves in the crown of the Noon Trunk itself . Some were no longer than my fingers , brittle , porous in places like a rotting twig , hard overall , but soft and dark at the core . Some were large as young trunks , four times my height , dry and rough , half-buried in the muck of seasons unnumbered . But what trunk could produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clutched by the roots of the trees that held our flathomes ? <p> Crawling lower , I circled a third of the great stack , staring into the bars and cracked fragments of its impenetrable shadows . Somehow , I knew , the secrets of the Quiet Wind lay hidden here , locked in the embrace of these shards . Ridiculously , I thought that if I could squirm my way to the center , I might find the flute snatched from me so long before ; and finding it , perhaps I would understand . <p> As I poked and prodded , a sharp length came away , clattered across my foot . I lifted it , turned it in the wan light : a crooked piece bent like my elbow , only curved and flat . On its inner edge grew a strange row of squarish knobs - no , not grown there , but embedded . <p> Recoiling with a shock of awareness , I lost my footing and sat down hard on the root , nearly dropping the branch . The squared knobs , I suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these were larger than my fist . What sort of tree , I asked myself in growing dread , sprouts teeth as its fruit ? <p> I flung the object away , watched it plummet with a soft , liquid sound into the mire below , and lie trapped , a splash of yellow-white against the black . Wiping my hands on my sodden shirt , revulsed at the touch of the tooth-branch , I looked around at the lumpish growths that glowed , at the roots ascending to the trunks . This was the end of all descents , where the Quiet Wind brought all things it stole - and where its power ended , for here there was no lower place ; here , growing things started their laborious journeys toward the sky . <p> When I gazed again into the white branches , I cried out , leapt to my feet : now I saw faces peering out at me . Hard faces they were , dry and white like the teeth and branches , yet unmistakably faces ; these were of the same size as mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow pits , and they had neither ears nor hair . Yet the teeth ... the teeth might have been mine , or those of anyone in the flathomes . Here and there the faces leered out of the pile , though none spoke or moved . None , I saw , had bodies , and with relief I told myself these were not real people at all , but things made , like the husk dolls with which children played . <p> Then a whisper passed among the roots behind me ; something stirred in the stagnant world . I turned , and in my exhaustion , in the unreasoning hope that had brought me to this place , I half expected to see Kirith floundering toward me . Her hair would shimmer even here with the sunlight that clung to her wherever she went . She would call to me , dance over the mud ; I would catch her in my arms , and our laughter would ring from the meaningless white branches . The hollow-eyed faces in the roots would watch us climb together . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tipping back my head , I watched a gyring shape rise higher and higher , a bloated , branchless trunk , horribly segmented and soft - a tremendous worm . Ropes of ooze trailed from its belly . It squirmed with slick , sucking noises , its weight shuddering the wood . Up , down , in hideous spirals , the beast insinuated itself through the root-caves , through the stacked white branches , which tumbled and rattled away from its thrusting , eyeless head . Its wrinkled flesh exuded the very fetor that had brought my dizziness , that permeated all this rotting gulf . <p> Shrinking , half-fainting , I pressed myself into a hollow as the plunging mouth - a circular pit , lined with knife-teeth - fed on the white branches , on the tree roots , on anything it encountered . I shrieked , heedless of discovery , covering my eyes and ears . <p> When I raised my head , the thing had quested past , length by rippling length , to other stacks . Still I could hear its ponderous pounding , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had defiled . <p> I recall little of my upward journey ; only that , before I climbed the trunks , I shouted Kirith 's name until my voice failed , and that I searched long among the silent mounds . <p> Now I am old , and soon I will join Kirith in the Glades of the Sun . I know she waits for me there ; my heart is at ease since I learned she is not lost and wandering in the dark abyss . I have been a Loreweaver myself , singing of light and beauty , watching seasons change . Seeds , rain , sun , and drying , the forest renews itself , its music unceasing . But I understand , too , why the Loreweavers speak little when the night wind rages in storms , making the limbs twist with deep groans . There is wisdom in silence , and they find the greatest peace who do not climb too far seeking truth ; for behind every answer lies a greater mystery . My journeys are finished now , save one . When my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ride the Quiet Wind , borne away amid the sending songs . I will not linger in that place where the vast , colorless worm gnaws at the roots of all that we are and know . <p> IMG
