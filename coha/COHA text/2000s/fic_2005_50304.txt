A Web search of this author 's name is likely to yield various genealogies and scientific articles that cite Hobson 's Choice , so let us help the cause by pointing you to www.demimonde.com . Scrutiny of that site will inform you that M. K. Hobson lives in Oregon with her husband and daughter and works for a marketing agency in Portland . Her short fiction has appeared in SCI FICTION , Vestal Review , and After Hours , and she is currently working on a novel . She has also published nonfiction in various venues , including an early piece with the eyebrow-raising title of " Bingo , the Game of Death . " Her F &SF; debut is a stylish story of haves and have-nots , with perhaps some concern over who 's who . <p> " YOU 'RE A MURDERER AND a rapist , and there may be no hope for you , " Winnie says to Ryan on a rainy afternoon at the end of the story . " But if there is , I will find it . I will remake you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a murderer and a rapist until very recently , so there is nothing to say . Nothing except the obvious words : It was only because I loved you , but Winnie would probably respond to that by breaking his arm , so he does not say it . Instead , he stares at the rain dripping through a broken place in the roof . They are in an old warehouse down by the river , a place he bought yesterday . He paid for it with a check from his leather-covered checkbook , probably the last one they will let him write . After buying the building , Ryan took the bucket of ashes out of the trunk of his green Lexus . With a shaking hand , he scattered them everywhere , over the floors , the walls , the windowsills . The ash rose up in great billowing clouds , choking him , mingling with his tears to make a gritty paste that he licked off his lips . And now , after everything , he and Winnie are both stretched out on a stained mattress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of vodka with a torn label . She looks just as she did when he first met her , immense ass and too-tight tank-top and all . Gone are the gray silk suit , the perfect teeth , the vacant stare . Now she just is what she is , nothing more or less . She has won . This is where the story ends , but it is not where it begins . The story begins on Ryan Ceres 's fortieth birthday . Ryan Ceres 's birthday is the fortieth anniversary of what has been , and promises to continue to be , a perfect life . He is a real-estate developer . He drives a green Lexus and he listens to adult contemporary rock . His fingernails are manicured and his hair is the color of fresh honey . His eyes are as blue as the sun shining through ice . He is celebrating the anniversary of his birth with his fiance , a slender redhead in a gray silk suit . They are having dinner at a restaurant on the top floor of the tallest building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salad that is composed of two delicate leaves of arugula , a lump of herb-crusted goat cheese and a garnet-colored curl of shaved beet . She is heartbreakingly beautiful in a thoroughly banal way . Ryan , however , has long since ceased to notice what she looks like . He is staring past her , out the tall black windows at the city below . Like jewels set in rich fabric , his buildings glow up at him . They beam up at him adoringly . They love him and he loves them . They are his real dinner partners . They are the ones with whom he is sharing his birthday dinner . He raises his wineglass to the window , blowing them silent imaginary kisses . At twenty , with a substantial endowment from a bachelor uncle who foresaw greatness in his young nephew 's cobalt blue eyes , Ryan started with old houses . Victorians , bungalows , foursquares , modernes ; he fed on plaster dust and linseed oil . When he turned thirty , he went looking for a larger challenge and found it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in 1911 . Eighty rooms of drunks and addicts . A wreck , a noble heap , a disaster with possibilities . He brought in his men , brutally efficient Russian laborers , and set them to work tearing the place apart . In one room they found hundreds of empty methadone bottles wedged under a floorboard , and hundreds of old hypodermics quivering in the ceiling above , flung like the pencils of schoolchildren , a garden of upside-down glass flowers . In another room , a room that smelled of mothballs and old-man liniment , dozens of dust-crumbling girlie magazines had been stuffed behind the wall . Stuffed there to block a draft ? To avoid embarrassment ? It did n't matter . His Russians burned them with all the rest of the mouldering yellow insulation . They stripped away rotting lath and horsehair plaster and put in smooth fresh drywall and expensive bamboo flooring , and when they were finished , the Gorham hotel featured eighty ultramodern studios with brushed metal refrigerators and cultured marble cooking islands . Only the best . It made him his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times since , expanding with capital inflows , contracting to meet expenses , expanding and contracting , like a great beating heart , pushing new blood through old buildings . The old bank that he turned into lawyer 's offices . The old department store that he turned into a mini-mall . The old brewery that he turned into a brewpub . And , most recently , the old flour mill , reclaimed from the dull-eyed clowder of Hispanic squatters living in her labyrinthine basements , that he turned into twenty thousand square feet of quaint little shops selling arugula , herb-crusted goat cheese , and organic beets . The proprietors of these little shops will make good money . Ryan will make nothing . His net profit on the deal is a satisfyingly round figure . Zero . Each building he takes on is a little bigger , each rehab a little more lovingly detailed , each project a little less profitable . There is a delicious purity in this that he relishes . It is not the money he desires . The money is nothing , only a tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting across the table from him . The real satisfaction comes from the knowledge that he has made his buildings clean and pure , burned the filth of ages from their bones , scoured them of the unseen impurities time breeds . He has uncovered chimneys full of dead birds ; the skeleton of a cat wedged between two wall studs , - decaying piles of rat shit in ancient ventilation ducts . He has exposed obscene secrets and expunged them . Quite suddenly , Ry an feels extremely pleased with himself . An erotic charge of satisfaction surges through his body . He looks lustfully at his fiance , somewhat surprised to find that she is still there . Her hair shines , her face is perfect , her nails gleam , her skin is smooth as glass . The relationship between her and the curl of beet she is contemplating is entirely without entropy , a universe which has long since ceased to expand . She is as self-contained as an egg . The electricity charging his nerves dissipates abruptly , and his sudden elation is replaced by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork heavily . The sound of silver on porcelain makes her look up . " Why would they put a curl of beet on the salad ? " she sneers melodiously . " No one likes beets . " " Some people obviously do , " he says , flashing her one of his sandpaper grins designed to smooth out rough patches . He 's perfected these grins , he uses them often . It helps to grin , he 's noticed , even when you feel like tearing someone 's throat out . Life has apparently taught her the same lesson . A polite , fleeting smile dances across her lips , replaced quickly by a pretty little frown as she returns to her contemplation of the despised curl of beet . It is Ryan 's fortieth birthday . He gives his fiance a good-night peck and does n't wait for the elevator doors to slide shut before he turns and walks away . His fiance must be in bed by 11 P.M. precisely , for she must be at the gym early the next morning to exorcise any fatty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pure corpus . She is utterly composed of routine and habit ; if she is not in bed by 11 P.M. precisely , she might start breaking things . The moment his lips leave the cold flesh of her cheek , he ceases to think about her . She ceases to exist . He goes back into the restaurant , to its clean elegant bar filled with fresh-looking young people . The counter is made of zinc and there are cobalt-blue vases with yellow gerbera daisies in them . He sits , drinking steadily , the zinc cooling his elbows . He thinks about his Russians , his agents of efficiency and order , who are currently working on a project for another developer . He misses them . They just wrapped the flour mill project a week ago , and already he misses them . He misses their sharp staccato conversations , their sublingual grunts , their smell of oniony sweat . They are remaking an old generic family chain restaurant ( orange and brown ) into a new generic family chain restaurant ( brown and orange ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and visiting them . But the idea depresses him . The building they are working on has no life , no spark . He longs for the thrill of performing surgery on a kicking patient , not slogging through the dissection of a corpse . Depressed , he leaves the restaurant , its zinc bar and gerbera daisies , and rides the elevator down to the street . The valet brings his green Lexus and he turns on the adult contemporary rock . Loud . It does n't help . LATER , LYING on a dirty mattress and drinking vodka from a bottle , Ryan will dream of this night . He will dream of the wind rushing through his hair like warm fingers , of the ceaseless rhythm of crickets blowing past , of the smell of leather seats covered with dew . For this is the night that he finds her . You will remake me , he whispers into her lap . But that is later . This night , he drives through the town , tapping a finger against his steering wheel , chewing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his buildings , hoping that one will call out to him , invite him back , but none of them do . So he drives into an ugly part of town , a dangerous part of town , a part of town that was n't safe or savory even during its best years . He drives until pink and gold dawn fingers the hills , until he begins to think that he should go somewhere , to an actual destination . To his fiancee 's home . She has bleached-oak floors in her entryway . She will serve him herbal tea with a shortbread cookie . He takes a left . He will drive back and find the freeway . Then his breath catches . She rises and spreads before him , white stone walls stark in the peach-colored dawn . Along her sides , thousands of tiny windows wink at him in the rising light . Some are broken ; these stare at him , black and insane . She is surrounded by tall weeds . Over the front door , the words " Windsor Machine Works " are spelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lush with the tragedy of a brilliant , aborted future . Below those letters , there are larger ones , painted on a warped sign nailed across her front door . The sign is old and battered , pocked with birdshot and curlicued with graffiti . But he can still read what it says . It says , FOR SALE . He parks slantways , jumps out of his car . He walks the cyclone fence surrounding until he finds a beaten-down place ; he tears the leg of his slacks climbing over it , carves an ugly gouge in his calf . No matter . She is made of white limestone as supple and smooth as a virgin 's thighs . Her black twisting ironwork is crisp and devilish . The crumpled yellow newspapers crouching at her feet are supplicants satisfied by the simple blessing of her shadow ; the glittering shards of broken glass bottles are like jewels , carelessly discarded . He climbs onto a low crumbling wall beneath one of the windows . He presses his nose to the grimy glass like a child hoping to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of square iron pillars and cement , thousands upon thousands of square feet of space . On the concrete floor , stagnant puddles glimmer , rainbowed with oil , reticulated with webs of settled dust . There are bolts in the cement where huge machines once anchored , straining against their own torque . He stands , his cheek pressed up against the glass , closing his eyes . He imagines walls hiding unimaginable decay , steel beams crumbling to dust , tinder-dry insulation chambered with mouse nests , wires wrapped in fraying cloth . He can feel the sunlight as it pounds into her . He 's in love . Again . He buys the Windsor Machine Works building that day . A birthday present for himself . It surprises the gals down at the County Assessor 's office to see Ryan Ceres camped on their doorstep when they open the doors . He is unshaven and there are shiny purple hollows under his eyes . The gals in the County Assessor 's office tell Ryan that if the building is for sale , they ca n't figure out who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it since 1963 . It seems , in fact , to have no owner at all . This greatly puzzles the gals , for they can not conceive of such an odd thing . It is an offense to their unimaginative natures to think that anything can escape taxation for that long . They chatter about it amongst themselves as they prepare the paperwork . Stop talking , he imagines screaming at them . Her secrets are not yours , they are mine , mine , mine .... He blinks , realizes that the gals are staring at him . They are staring at him so hard he wonders suddenly if he 's said something aloud that he did n't mean to . He wipes a hand across his brow , flashes them his sandpaper smile . They would n't understand . Pulling out his leather-covered checkbook ( which they understand completely ) , Ryan writes a check for the entire amount of back taxes , and just like that , the building is his . As he 's driving back across town , he is joyful . He is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , and he has the top down and his sunglasses on . The warm wind is snaking through his hair . Adult contemporary rock blasts out of his speakers . This moment is the absolute peak of his life . A sudden thought strikes him . He flips open his tiny titanium phone and presses it to his ear . He calls Jose ( Jose is his locksmith , always on the move ) and arranges to meet him at the building . Arrangements made , Ryan flips his phone closed and taps the steering wheel in time to a Cline Dion song . When Ryan arrives back at the Windsor Machine Works , Jose is already there , bending over the open trunk of his always-breaking-down Justy . Jose is sorting through picks and tension tools and extractors . Choosing his implements carefully . Ryan is flooded with inexplicable anger . The thought of another man sniffing around her doorstep enrages him . What if he 'd decided to tamper with her before Ryan had got there ? What if he 'd decided to put his unkind picks into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " Ryan asks casually . " Just got here , " Jose tosses off . " " Bout to leave , though . Bad neighborhood . They shoot you for nothing around here . " Ryan imagines punching him in the nose . Jose does n't speak as he makes the key . When he is finished , he fits the bright new thing into the old door , and turns . The door swings open , releasing a smell of ancient oil and something else , strange and indefinable , like steel shavings rusting in honey . " What the hell are you thinking , man ? " Jose says . He stands with his hands on his hips , squinting into the gloom . He shakes his head as if trying to shake off raindrops of impending doom . " This place will finish you . " Ryan snatches the key away from him with a growl . " Get out , " Ryan says . " Get the fuck out . " He does not watch or wave good-bye as the Justy clatters away . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , and he is on the manufacturing floor . The gals at the County Assessor 's office say that their oldest records indicate that this building was used to manufacture machine parts during the First World War . That whole area was really hopping during the war , one of the gals had said . Ryan imagines women in hobble-skirts , men in baggy canvas twill trousers , paunchy old managers in vests with watch-chains looped from button to pocket . All gone now . The manufacturing floor smells like stale urine and pigeon shit . As Ryan walks through the wide door and into the building , the space swells around him , the filtered light through the dust-caked windows cool and blue , the cement floor vast and undulating like a calm body of water . His footsteps echo . On the floor there is a pile of repair manuals from the " 30s for a machine of indecipherable purpose . The manuals look as if they 've been stored in a bucket of old oil . Blackberry vines thread through broken windowpanes . The iron pillars are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump trucks and caterpillar tractors that will soon line up outside . He thinks about how the weeds will be cut away and the rusted pillars pulled down , and the oil-slicked concrete cleaned with foaming buckets of trisodium phosphate . He thinks about multi-use dwellings , white space , windows . He thinks about how everything dirty will be made clean , antiseptic , new , smooth . He closes his eyes and spreads his arms and imagines himself expanding , expanding . At the back of the room is a set of stairs . He moves over to them carefully , avoiding the puddles and piles of grimy debris . In the rafters overhead , he hears baby pigeons squeaking weakly , and the sound of wings . The staircase is a jury-rigged affair . Ryan mounts the stairs , carefully feeling each board for soundness . He stops after a few steps , looks back . The door is still open and the warm afternoon sunlight is inviting him back , calling him to come out . But it is hot out there , and in here it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange smell of honey and steel . He looks up the stairs . At the top there is a hollow-core plywood door with a jagged-edged hole in the center . He imagines rotting construction , thin-walled offices , and empty filing cabinets . It is dark at the top of the stairs . He keeps climbing . The door opens onto a hallway , its linseed linoleum flooring warped and curled . Four doors open off the hallway , two on either side . He opens the first door . There is an office beyond , nothing in it but a mouse 's nest and some chewed-on newspapers . He looks in the second office . It has a heavy metal desk in it . There is a window that looks over the factory floor , but it is covered with plywood . There is a woman in the third office . Ryan jumps when he sees her , slamming back against the door with a rattling thud . She is sitting with her back against the wall , staring up at the ceiling as if expecting it to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look that is both empty and full , like she is thinking very deep thoughts about nothing . " Jesus , " he whispers , his heart pounding in his throat . " Who the hell are you ? " She drops her oil-colored eyes and looks at him , not blinking . She is , Ryan notices , as far from beautiful as a woman can get . She is shaped like a bell ; her ass is immense , her waist lumpy , her shoulders strangely narrow . Her breasts poke out through her too-tight tank-top , and they 're small and hard and probably sour , like unripe persimmons . Her arms are thick with muscle . " Winnie , " she says , lifting a hand . In it , there is a bottle of vodka . She takes a swig of this and holds the bottle toward him . Squatter , he thinks , with a mixture of disgust and glee . The first secret to be stripped , the first boil to be lanced . He knows how to deal with squatters . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is firm and unshaking , full of money . " No , " she says . " I 've bought this place . It 's mine now . " Winnie does not move , but stares at him , a grim little smile playing over her lips . " Yours , eh ? " she says . Ryan thinks about going for the police . But it is hot out there , burning and dry , and in here it is cool . So instead of leaving , he does something stupid . Something he knows he should not do . He reaches out and grabs the strange woman 's arms , tries to pull her to her feet . He halfway succeeds before she wrenches herself backward , pulling him off balance and sending him tumbling to the dirty floor . She moves quickly , coming up over him . With a balled fist , she punches down viciously , catching his chin . He puts up his arms , shields his face . The world is a confusion of movement and pain as she hits him . Her fists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closes his eyes . " Yours , eh ? " she shrieks again and again , until her voice finally retreats down a dark tunnel . He wakes up choking . The woman is pouring vodka down his throat . He gags , shoving her hand aside . He is lying on the floor . He wants to jump up , but he can not ; he is stiff and sore . He can barely move . She is sitting next to him , legs stretched out before her . In her hand , she has a long heavy piece of wood that looks like it came out of a ruined place in the wall . She is tapping the wood gently against her knee . He looks at her lap , stretched out beside him . It is vast , doughy , clad in worn-thin sweatpants . He tentatively reaches over a hand to touch it . It is warm , like pudding encased in a heating blanket . Winnie says nothing , but takes a drink of the vodka . Then she hands it to him . He takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking from it delicately . She offers him a cigarette . He does n't smoke . But he watches as she puts one in her mouth , lights it carefully , exhales the smoke in a thin stream . " Why are you here ? " Winnie asks . " This place is mine now , " Ryan says , his voice uncertain . " I bought it . " " You bought it . " She says the words flatly , a statement , not a question . She seems to find them humorous , but she does not smile ; instead , she flares her nostrils . " Why ? " " To ... to clean it . To make it new . " " What if it does n't want to be ? " Ryan blinks at her , as lost as one of the gals at the Assessor 's office . " What are you talking about ? " " What if it just wants to be what it is ? What it has become ? " This makes Ryan laugh , a loud barking laugh that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip curling . She lifts the wood , brings it down hard . He curls his arms around his head again , and again the world retreats in darkness . WHEN HE WAKES UP , she is gone and he is alone . He limps down the stairs and out of the building , down to where his green Lexus is waiting . It is night , a thick hot summer night . Where did the whole day go ? He has the most horrific hangover he 's ever experienced , and he aches terribly . Running his tongue over his lip , he can tell that it 's split . Touching fingers to his eyes , he can tell that they 're blackened . When he gets to his green Lexus he looks at his reflection in the rear-view mirror . It 's worse than he thought . There 's a red welting crease over his cheekbone , and both his eyes are as purple and blue as overripe plums . First , he uses his cell phone to call the police . He tells them about the crazy squatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a man of substance , goddamn it ! He has pumped millions into the local economy over the past decade . He is on a first-name basis with the mayor . Yes , he is willing to press charges for assault . He wants her locked up for life . Maybe in an insane asylum . Satisfied , he flips his phone shut . Then he drives to his fiancee 's condominium . She is wearing green silk pajamas , and she looks as smooth and beautiful as fresh plaster . She looks at him blankly , without interest , without surprise , without anything . She does not even comment on his battered face . In a flash of blackness , he shoves her to the ground and makes passionate , unpleasant love to her on the bleached oak floor of her entry hall . Then , sitting naked on her distressed leather couch , her black portable phone pressed to his ear , he calls every contractor he knows . The most brutal , the most efficient , the most pragmatic , the most no-nonsense . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first month , they clean . Contractors tear out the old offices where Ryan was beaten , commenting on the drops of dried blood and the smell of spilt vodka . The police find no squatter . They search the place thoroughly , come quickly to the conclusion that she has " moved on , " and happily wash their hands of the whole thing . Ryan , however , is not satisfied with this sanguine pronouncement . In fact , every now and again , Ryan is sure he sees Winnie 's lumpy figure out of the corner of his eye , rushing at him , the wood in her hand raised high . Her eyes are lit with hatred and anger . But she is never really there , and the police ca n't arrest someone they ca n't see . Ryan 's brutal and efficient men start to call him " twitchy , " for he is always involuntarily dodging blows . After a month , the building is completely gutted and structural work can begin . It is then that Winnie really does reappear . Ryan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he smells honey and steel , sweet and fleeting . He looks up , alarmed , expecting to see her bearing down on him with the wood . But she 's just standing , looking at him , her arms crossed behind her back . She seems to have lost weight . Her ass is smaller and her legs seem skinnier . Her skin seems smoother . He regards her for a while , assessing danger . She 's still and solid and sullen . He flashes her a sandpaper grin . " You 're back ? " he says . " Never left , " she says . " Never will leave . Never . " " I would n't be too sure of that , " Ryan says . " The police .... " " The police wo n't find me , " she says , looking at him . She looks paler , he notices . Slightly sick . There is a strange shimmer about her , as if he can see her bones superimposed upon her flesh , a luminous ghost-skeleton that moves as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision from his eyes . " What gives you the right ? " she asks , softly . " What gives you the right to do this ? " His brow curdles . It is an insane question . " I own this building , " he says slowly , reducing each word to inarguable finality . : K " That is not an answer , " she says . " What other answer is there ? " Ry an blazes , sudden frustration firing him . He wants her to shut up , to do what she is told . Winnie is silent for a few moments . She is standing at a place where a wall used to be . The wall is gone , only structural timbers remain . She stretches out a hand , strokes her fingers through the air that the wall used to occupy . He can see every bone in her hand set in angular contrast against the timbers and studs and beams . The stark intersecting lines are indescribably beautiful . " I do not want to be what you want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches her stroke the ghost-wall . The moment of adoration passes , giving way to critical dissatisfaction . Her movements are crisp , clumsy , machinelike . Inelegant , he thinks . She needs curves , smooth clean curves that please the eye . He makes a mental note to work with the architect on some streamlined walls for the entrance . " You have no right , " she gasps , and he realizes that she is crying . " You have no right to change something that does not want to be changed . " He takes a step forward , then another , like an unwise park visitor approaching a seemingly tame bear . He reaches out a hand , and touches her face . " There now , " he says , stroking her cheek . Her skin is smoother , he notices with satisfaction . " There now . " Winnie reaches into her pocket for a cigarette . Her hand is trembling . " No smoking , " Ryan says gently , prying the cigarette from between her fingers . With a ferocious snarl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart thudding . A surprisingly pleasant thrill surges through him . " It 's for your own good , " he adds , holding fists defensively before his chest , expecting her to rush him . " Liar , " she spits at him , and in the time it takes him to blink she is gone . Problems arise , one after another . Expensive problems . Seismic upgrades . Asbestos removal . Hazardous waste disposal from where old puddles of oil have polluted the ground . It is easy to take out the first construction loan ; Ryan 's bankers love him . They even love him enough to give him a second . But the third one is difficult . They shuffle their wingtips and cast glances back and forth . It is clear that they share some of Jose 's concerns . We 're unclear on your vision here , Mr. Ceres . The freeway 's a dozen blocks away . To call the neighborhood transitional is being generous .... The infrastructure 's marginal ... no retail component anywhere nearby .... Ryan bullies them and gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should be enough . That , added to some liquidated longer-term investments .. . his broker will squeal that the money is for his future , but Ryan does n't care . She is his future . The contractors finish the framing . The smell of fresh pine is one of the best smells Ryan knows . It 's the same smell that disinfectants have , and Ryan always associates new framing with cleanliness . Old ugly hidden things , invisible squirming vermin being scorched away , burned away , sterilized . One of Ryan 's brutally efficient Russian workers , a framer , is named Sergei . He leaves behind a plate of bread and salt one night , which Ryan stumbles over . Ryan swears roughly at Sergei ; while the Russian is much bigger than he is , it 's always good to look tough to one 's people . " What the hell is this ? " Ryan picks up the plate of bread and salt and shakes it in the big man 's face . " We got the rats cleared out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will not attract rats , " Sergei shrugs . " She will not let it . " " She ? " Ryan looks at him . " Who ? " " The building , " Sergei says . " The domovoi. " seeing that Ryan does not understand , Sergei gently takes the plate of bread and salt from him and puts it down carefully . " The domovoi is the spirit of the building . Its soul . This building 's soul is sad and in pain . I thought to comfort her . " " Comfort her ? " Ryan clenches his teeth , remembering Winnie bearing down on him with the wood . " I 'm not paying you to comfort the goddamn building . " He kicks at the plate of bread and salt , sending it scattering across the plywood flooring . Sergei shrugs , and turns to go . Ryan calls after him : " Can they be killed ? " Sergei turns slowly , looks at him through narrowed eyes . " Killed ? " he says . " Yes , " Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have heard that they can be moved , " Sergei says thoughtfully . " By carrying hearth coals to a new home . If the domovoi likes it there .... " " I did n't say moved , " Ryan interrupts him sharply . " I said killed . Can they be killed ? " Sergei shrugs , looks around at the clean-smelling new pine framing . " I suppose this is the way to do it , " he says . Winnie does not show herself again until month four . The contractors are putting in bamboo flooring and installing energyefficient double-paned glass windows . The money is running thin , but Ryan will not cut corners . He runs up bills that he knows he will not pay . This does not concern him in the least . Visitors from the bank begin showing up at the worksite , at odd hours of the day . Taking notes . Ryan is in a room that will become the master bedroom of the most expensive loft , eight thousand square feet of exposed concrete and thick hewn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiring for a ceiling fan and arched windows that look out over the street . He 's looking down at the street , his hands clasped behind his back . On the street , there 's a man leaning against a blue camaro , selling drugs . " Please stop . " The words come from behind him . He turns slowly . She looks much thinner now , her face sleek and shining . Her hair is smoothed back from a soft , placid face . She 's wearing a suit of gray silk . He looks her up and down , approvingly . " It hurts , " she says . " Please stop . " " I 'm too far along now , " he says . The words make her wince visibly . A vague premonition of worry crosses his mind . What is the pain in his chest , what is the ineffable regret ? He does n't understand it ; he dismisses it with a curt gesture of his hand . " You 're just afraid of change , " he says , more harshly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winnie says again . " Good things sometimes hurt , " Ryan says , careful to make his tone soft . He wants her to understand , he wants her to stop fighting . He wants her to let him have her , to give him access and permission . " Medicine hurts . It hurts , but it heals . " " You are not healing me , you are killing me , " she whispers . " I do n't know what I am anymore . " " It does n't matter , " he says . " I know what you are . " " I hate you , " she whispers , tears gleaming slick in her oil-colored eyes . Ryan smiles down at her sadly . She does n't hate him . He knows it , just knows it . She does n't hate him . She ca n't hate him . " You hate the idea of changing , " he says . " You hate the idea of being changed . You hate the idea of letting someone else help you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you did . By decaying , by getting old , by letting yourself fall to ruin , " Ryan strokes her hair . " But I will make it better . I will take care of you . " " It huits , " Winnie says finally , and then she 's gone , and Ryan 's arms encircle nothing . After six months , the renovation is complete . The Windsor Machine Works rehab is finished . It is clean , sterile , perfect . There are no secrets left . Every item on the punch list has been checked off , and the Russians have been paid , even if there are other bills that never will be . There are five vast condo lofts on the top floor , each with a prime view of the surrounding neighborhood . The ramshackle houses that have n't been painted in years , the rusting cars in their driveways and side-yards , the drug dealers and prostitutes in their blue Camaros . Who said there was n't a viable retail component ? Ryan has had a dozen calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties . They 're trying to back out . They want nothing to do with marketing this one . He enjoys listening to the voicemails , how they get progressively screechier . There is fifteen thousand square feet of retail space on the ground floor , lease ready . The blonde wood floors and cool white lighting are perfect for the Starbucks and the Gap and the Old Navy that will never come . Ryan takes one last walk through the building , but he does not enjoy it . He feels so strange . The familiar joy , the pride and feeling of completion , the post-orgasmic relaxation of tense energy pleasantly spent , is nowhere to be felt . Instead he feels keyed up , anxious and annoyed . Frustrated . Stifled . Twitchy . He comes into the room where he last saw Winnie . This is the display model ; it has been decorated so that perky sales agents can inspire prospective residents with visions of the kind of life their exorbitantly high mortgage can purchase for them . The walls have been painted a soothing shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camel-colored suede furniture in one corner . One chair is draped with a fuzzy , avocado-hued chenille throw . Ryan tries to imagine getting comfortable in this room . He ca n't . The thought gives him a headache . There is also a large white bed , a cast-iron four-poster looped with gauze that ( Ryan knows from experience ) will have to be washed every goddamn week to keep from getting dusty . More meaningless garniture . More curls of shaved beet . He imagines making love to his fiance in that bed , in that engulfing marshmallow-sof t nest . Imagines her yielding body , her blank eyes staring up at him . What is wrong with him ? He presses his fingers to the bridge of his nose . These things sell . These are what people want . Why should they annoy him so ? Why does he suddenly long for the smell of motor oil and rust and honey ? " Winnie ! " he whispers loudly , looking wildly about the room . " Winnie , for God 's sake ! " Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation is complete . She is slender and sylphlike , with a delicate face and vacant eyes . She looks , Ryan notices with sudden horror , exactly like his fiance . She is staring out the window , thinking unfathomable thoughts . Her hair shines , her face is perfect , her nails gleam , her skin is smooth as glass . She is perfect and perfectly self-contained . " You know something strange ? " she says distantly , her face wrinkling in a pretty frown . " It does n't hurt anymore . " That night , Ryan burns it down . Burns it all down ; the bamboo flooring , the soothing mint-green walls , the new plaster . Everything . He storms through the dark virgin rooms with a five-gallon gasoline can . He lights the fire by putting a ripped piece of rag into the mouth of a bottle of vodka . Then he stands across the street and watches her burn , brilliant greens and oranges , deep mysterious flickers of blue , black billowing smoke that makes the sky weep . He sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like busy insects . Dawn breaks , the sun rises , and no one notices him , no one knows who he is ; he is just another man , sitting silently , watching something go up in flames . He waits until the firemen have gone , leaving behind nothing but yellow tape and the smell of death and her gray , hulking , empty skeleton , charred and angular . Crawling through the yellow tape , sneaking like an animal , he moves around at her feet , through her hot shadow . With a shaking hand , he fills a galvanized bucket with damp gray ash . There are pieces of wood mixed in with it ; wood like bone . He places both hands on the side of the bucket , closing his eyes . There is a warmth banked within , the warmth of pudding encased in a heating blanket , the warmth of rage and retribution and desire . " Come with me , " he whispers , pleading . " Stay with me . Please . " He puts the bucket into the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the County Assessor 's office . They are surprised again , because he smells like smoke and his face is streaked with ash and tears . But they take his check gladly and issue him a receipt with a formal red stamp on it . And so he reclines with Winnie in the warehouse by the river . In the rain . On a stained mattress , drinking vodka from a bottle with a torn label . Ryan 's appraising gaze shifts to the brick wall instinctively , out of habit . Once painted glossy white , now it 's grimy , smudged with old black handprints . How many layers of paint hide beneath there ? I should strip that paint , he thinks . Expose the biick . People like exposed brick . As soon as the thought crosses his mind , pain sears through him , tearing his heart into little throbbing bits . He gasps for air . " The secrets stay , " Winnie growls . Ryan presses both palms flat against the sides of his head , as if he can press the pain out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he begins . " You breathed in the ash when you were scattering it , " Winnie says , taking a drink from the vodka bottle . There is a long silence while she lets Ryan absorb the implications of what she has said . Then she looks at him with cool , unblinking , oil-colored eyes . " You 're a murderer and a rapist , " she says again . How could he not have seen it ? It is a secret he kept from himself , only now brought into the light to be scoured away . With a shaking hand , Ryan takes the bottle of vodka from her . He takes a long harsh swallow . He 's forty , rich and beautiful , and the ghosts of his victims will live within him for the rest of his life . He lays his head on her soft , - warm lap . " You will remake me , " he says , closing his eyes . He will sleep . He will sleep for a long time . He will dream her dreams . He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisite beauty of acceptance . He feels her hand upon his head . She smoothes his hair carefully . " There may be hope for you , " she says very softly , her voice sweet as honey .
