Rachel was the one who delivered the message . In the middle of dinner , she remembered the phone call , stood up , tossed her braid over her shoulder , and dug in her pocket for a scrap of paper . " Mom , " then she looked warily at her father , " Dad , the prison called again today . " She squinted at her eight-year-old scrawl . " They said Uncle Tony gets out tomorrow afternoon . He can be picked up at the a-n-n-e-x . " <p> Ellen sighed . " You remember your uncle Tony , " she said , keeping her voice light , wanting to reassure her daughter . She knew she should be feeling , if not elated , then at least relieved , as if the long ordeal were finally over and Tony could rejoin the living . After all , in the cosmic scheme of things , his crimes were like the buzzing of a gnat . She knew this . Still . She knew what prison could do to a man , remembered all the guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out jumpy as hell . Mean . Just like when guys got home from Nam . No telling what would set them off . And , like them , Tony was being released to nothing : no home , no wife , no friends , a daughter he did n't even know . Nothing . Nada . <p> But Rachel just shrugged . What was there to remember ? She was only three when he got sent up . Five years ago . They 'd only been to visit him once . <p> " It 'll be okay , mi'ja , " Richard said . " You 'll see . " Then , to Ellen , " My mom has already asked if he can work with me . " He raised his eyebrows . What could he do ? Tony was his little brother . He got up and opened the refrigerator . Popped open a beer . Surveyed his garden out the back window . The corn was just coming up . His nana had always had a garden when he was a child , tomatoes climbing rickety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiles and hollyhocks . He and Tony had often hidden between the rows . He could n't remember a time before Tony was born . <p> Daniel looked up from his spaghetti . " What ? " he asked , his mouth full , sauce smeared on the corners of his lips . <p> " Your uncle Tony is getting out . " <p> " Oh , oh , " he said , " better hide the checks . " He was kidding ; he liked Tony . At eleven , he remembered his uncle , how he took him to see Star Wars , over and over , no matter how many times Daniel asked . <p> " What if we do n't want him to get out ? " Rachel 's shoulders were still hunched in a shrug . <p> Richard said , " Guess I 'd better fix the lock on that door . " <p> " Put bars on the windows , " Daniel laughed . <p> " Warn the neighbors , " Ellen went along . But what would she tell them if there were suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's just my brother-in-law . He only takes what he can carry . He does n't have a car . <p> Richard killed his beer . " It 'll be all right , " he said again . He threw the can in the trash and then walked out the front door , stood in the yard . The neighbor kids were riding their bikes on the sidewalk , zooming in and out of the street to pass one another . To Richard , suddenly , the place seemed foreign . Not like the barrio he 'd grown up in where everyone had known everyone for generations . Here , people moved in for a few years . Until their kids were grown . He guessed it was like any working-class neighborhood in America : narrow streets lined with trees , small houses constructed of red brick or burnt adobe or siding . In the evenings , men parked their work trucks along the sidewalk ; women still hung clothes on the line ; children whooped and hollered until dusk . The last few years , though , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up instead of replaced . People were keeping their trucks until the wheels fell off . Hell , it was hard for him to find enough work-for an excon , like Tony , it would be impossible , and , Richard figured , with a guy like Reagan in office , things would get worse before they got better . He did n't have any choice but to help Tony out . Otherwise . Quien sabe ? <p> When Richard walked back into the kitchen , he put his hands on Ellen 's shoulders and then kissed the top of her head before sitting back down at the table . She traced the knobby bone on his wrist . His fingers were absently tapping the smooth wood of the table . A few petals from the bouquet of bougainvillea next to him drifted down to the table and scattered , the thin petals veined like leaves , curling brown on the edges . She 'd bunched them into a vase , the clusters spilling over , magenta against the white wall . Behind him , the glass doors and fawn haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel 's , the reddish tints the light made . All of it could be so easily disturbed , a stone tossed into a pool , but she knew they could n't lock Tony out of their lives any more than they could stop the flooding back of memory . And that was the intrusion she feared , the intrusion of the past . She and Richard had done many of the same things Tony had done , only they quit and he got caught-and now he 'd spent five of the past eight years in prison . <p> She had this weird feeling-it was n't dj vu , exactly , it was more like she could suddenly see her life as a time-traveler might see it . She could see Richard as he was , a man in his early thirties , lines at the corners of his eyes . His hair was short . And there she was , no longer rail-thin . She was someone 's mother . Two someones . How did we get here , she wondered , in this house , parents of two children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuum , it was n't a line but a dimension , and it had cracked and let Richard and Ellen walk into the room-Richard and Ellen when they were room to room , dazed . Shit , they said , can you believe it ? <p> The next day Ellen called in sick and kept the kids out of school . They packed some fruit , nuts , and water in a daypack and drove up to the state park . It was a perfect day , a clear sky , cool air even though the sun was already warm . They walked slowly up the paved road that took them into the canyon . Every now and then they stopped and looked at the saguaros . Soon , Ellen told them , the flowers would bloom , crown them . She pointed out the new buds on the thin branches of the ocotillo . The grass was a tender green , the poppies and yellow paper flowers in bloom . <p> After a while , they decided to climb up a large ravine . They had to hop on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Rachel needed a little help up the huge granite slabs . " Lean into the mountain , " he told her . A few times , he stood on the top of the boulder and held his hand out to Ellen . He picked out a trail , holding back branches of acacia and creosote as Ellen and Rachel followed . <p> After about fifteen minutes , they rested on a large slab of rock . Daniel said he thought they were the only ones who had ever climbed that far . Rachel started collecting small pieces of quartz that were imbedded with mica . She wanted to know if she 'd found silver . Ellen wondered when children got used to the world . When did they stop seeing ? She told them she wanted them to notice everything around them . " Even the way the light is , " she said . She said she wanted them to think about important things . " Not just who you like or who likes you . Or what clothes to wear . " She told them to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of green you saw only in early spring . <p> Rachel stuffed her rocks into a pocket of the daypack . " But I do wonder who likes me , " she said . <p> Daniel threw a small stone . It arced out and just missed the stream below . " What Mom means is she wants us to think about the world and the ecosystem and things like that . " <p> " I know . " Rachel gave him a dark look . " One time I even asked her who made it so a tree is called a tree and a cat a cat and not the other way around . " <p> Ellen wanted to laugh-Rachel was competitive about everything-but , instead , she put her hand on her arm . " Sshh . A cardinal . " They watched the bright red as it flashed through the green of the canyon , and then Daniel went back to throwing stones and Rachel to collecting them . <p> " I do n't like Uncle Tony , " Rachel said suddenly , plopping down next to Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nana . " <p> " Maybe you do n't remember any good things about him , " Ellen said . <p> " Like what ? " <p> " Oh , like he likes ketchup on his bologna sandwiches . Instead of mayonnaise . " <p> " That 's a good thing ? " <p> " He can do card tricks , " Daniel said . <p> " He likes those shows about animals on TV , " Ellen said . <p> Rachel scrunched up her face . <p> " Once he took Steph and me to the zoo , " Daniel said . <p> " He has a sickness , " Ellen said . " He never should have gone to jail . " <p> " Oh . " Rachel was quiet for a while . " It 's because he 's Mexican , huh ? That 's why they sent him . " <p> Ellen laughed . " Now you sound like your father . " She pulled out some oranges and began to peel them . It was so quiet she felt as if they were alone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to hold on to that moment of peace , of simply being with them . To memorize it . She knew they would grow too fast . Away from her . She would have to let them go out into the world . She would n't be able to keep them safe . Not even from themselves . Not even from their own dangerous inclinations . <p> They were already , each of them , so separate from her , different from both her and Richard . And it bothered Richard a little , she knew , that they were not like him , not Mexican enough-really , she supposed , that was the way to put it . That was what bothered him . Especially about Daniel . Daniel with his haircut skater-style , and his long colorful shorts and big T-shirts . He looked like a kid from one of those big houses in the foothills . Ellen could see him through Richard 's eyes , almost as someone else 's child , a child who had never been deprived of anything-who had never been hungry or without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had never known any of the pain that still colored Richard 's childhood , and while that was exactly what Richard wanted , what he had worked so hard to provide , she knew it also worried him . He was afraid Daniel would grow up weak , that he would become just the kind of man Richard scorned . You should see them , he 'd say of the college kids who worked for him in the summers , they 've had everything handed to them . They do n't know what it means to work . And you should hear them put us down . They 're not going to be in construction all their lives . <p> Look , she 'd tell him , the kids I work with at the store are the same way . Give them time . At eighteen I 'd always had everything I needed . Suffering does n't necessarily make you a good person . <p> But she knew he imagined her childhood as always smooth , like the water of the pool in her parents ' backyard . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline credit card . You were spoiled , he always told her . <p> When he and Tony were young , their family lived in the back of an old Chinese grocery . The grocery had been boarded up years before when one of the grocers was murdered with a cleaver . Richard said that at night the lights in the grocery would suddenly go on , even though there was no longer any electricity in that half of the building . On some nights , they could hear the cleaver clacking on wood . Another time they lived in an old house with wooden floors and a fireplace . The fireplace turned out to be fortunate because , more often than not , the electricity , water , and gas were turned off . Their mother cooked in the fireplace . He remembered her leaning over and lifting the lid to check on the beans . He remembered walking next door with a bucket to get water from their neighbors ' faucet . At dusk , he used to run down the alley to the store for milk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed at him . In the morning , a winito or two , maybe the same ones , knocked at their back door , and his mother gave them cups of coffee and pieces of tortilla or bread . When his father came home late at night from the cantinas , he told them stories about la llorona , the coyote , the girl who danced with the devil . Richard remembered only parts of those stories , but they all remembered the hole in the wooden floor and the cat that came up one night and sat on their father 's chest as he slept , trying to suck the breath out of him . They all remembered being hungry . <p> Ellen sometimes wondered if she had married Richard because his childhood was more interesting than hers . Exotic . Not only that , but it had a certain clarity hers lacked . His memories were definite and hard-edged , they had the quality of stories , while hers were impressionistic , dark colors . In his , there was good and evil personified : cats who might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes suggested by color or shadow , and underneath , always , her father 's drinking , her mother 's bitterness . An angry silence . There was no story . Everything remained unspoken . When they finally broke up and sent her to boarding school , she 'd been relieved , not lonely . Even her mother 's threat of disinheritance , when she eloped with Richard , was no obstacle . Ellen had seen it as a final rupture , a declaration of independence neither she nor her mother could ever go back on . Richard 's family was her family now , her chosen family , his brother and sisters substitutes for those she never had . <p> Not only had he grown up in a different world than she had , but , in some ways , he still lived in a different world . He always said he knew , by feelings , what would happen and what would not . He knew when his grandmother was going to die because he dreamed that some neighbor women came and stood outside her fence . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and a week later his nana died from an operation . The night Tony 's best friend died , Richard dreamed the death , the details of the overdose , the bathroom , the police , all clear in his mind . Before Tony got sent up , Richard dreamed about a painting by Diego Rivera , the one with a white wall , a window that looks out on nothing , a black revolver on the windowsill . <p> She often thought of these things , past dreams and past events , and told herself they proved nothing , they did n't determine the present or the future . But sometimes , at night , lying in the darkness next to Richard , she 'd know they were right . She knew because before she fell in love with him , she had a dream that he came to her and said , Everything will be all right . In the dream , they were flying through darkness , they were lying down , flying among the stars , and he put the palm of his hand against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right . " <p> A few weeks later , when Richard brought Tony by the house , Ellen could n't help but be surprised by his pale skin , by how much weight he 'd gained . Richard was much thinner than Tony now , and much darker , from working out in the sun . Tony 's hair was curlier , it had always been curlier , wild sometimes , but now it was short , slicked back . <p> " Whew , " he greeted her with a bear hug . " Looking go-od . " <p> " Gained some weight , " she laughed . " But then so have you . " <p> He laughed , and a curl fell down on his forehead ; he shook it back in place with one movement . Pachuco style . He had a tattoo on his forearm . She remembered him without it . And when he spoke , he spoke with an accent , something he had never done before . In prison , it was important to be part of la raza . <p> Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer , and then joined them in the living room . They talked for a while , mostly Richard and Tony talked about work , and then Tony said , " Remember that guy Reid ? " <p> Richard nodded , absently , and picked up the sports section . He did n't want to talk about the old days anymore . All day at work for the past week , it was all Tony had wanted to do , tell him about the guys they 'd known who were now in the joint , or tell him about his new carnales , his brothers . That was how he talked . Hey , bro . It bothered Richard no end . He hoped it was some kind of reentry phenomenon . <p> " Reid 's dead , " Tony said , " they found him in Nogales . In an alley . They just dumped him there . He 'd OD'ed , and they did n't even try to revive him . Just took his dope and his money and left him in the alley . " He looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for days . " <p> " And ? What did you expect ? " <p> Tony gave a low whistle . " That 's cold , man . " He shook his head at Ellen . " Can you believe how cold some people are ? He was there for days . Until these dogs started dragging him out . " <p> Richard lifted the newspaper in front of his face again . <p> " The last time I saw Reid was when we visited you guys up at the Fort , " Ellen said . " That picnic we had , remember ? " They had brought food and spent the day in the visitors ' yard , gathered around the long picnic tables at the minimum-security prison . She had been surprised Tony and Reid could be friends there . Especially after the things she 'd heard about the prison in Florence . Tony could n't talk to whites or blacks at Florence , not even if he 'd known them on the outside , but when he got transferred to minimum security , the Fort , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny thing was , Ellen had known Reid long before she ever met Richard and Tony . She always remembered him in a car , driving fast , one hand on the wheel , blond hair messy with wind . Then there was the time they were sitting in the park and he rolled up his girlfriend 's sleeve to show Ellen where he 'd stabbed her with a syringe , over and over , these dime-sized purple bruises . There were some things she preferred not to remember . <p> Tony was staring out the window at the leafy branches of the mulberry . At the work trucks lined up and down the street and the kids on their bicycles . He sighed , " You guys have lived in this house a long time . " <p> He looked desorientado , like he was a foreigner or , more likely , as if the passage of time had just registered . She was about to say something . Maybe about the tree , or living there , maybe simply about the past , it 's behind us , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He said , " I called over at Jenna 's mom 's house yesterday , and they would n't let me talk to her . Hell , even in prison , you get visitors . " <p> He walked around the room . Picked up the picture on the bookcase , the one Ellen had taken of Stephie with Daniel and Rachel for his mother . <p> " Look , I was understanding . I told her , You do what you 've got to do . When I get out , we 'll put things back together . But now I 'm out , I see how it is . " When neither Richard nor Ellen responded , he walked over to the window . " Shit , she could at least let me see Stephie . " <p> Richard was scanning some stats on the sports page ; he did n't want to touch this one . Neither did Ellen . They both knew Tony could be explosive on the subject of Jenna . After all , he had taken the fall for her , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tony lit a cigarette . " It 's like this , when I was in there , I knew it was hard for her . I told myself , Fucking is only fucking , but she 'd better not give her love away . " <p> Richard sighed . " Somehow I always thought the two were connected . " <p> " What world do you live in ? " Tony blew smoke out in an angry stream . <p> Richard put the newspaper down . " So what do you have to learn in this life ? Patience ? " <p> Tony jerked his head back . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " <p> " You know . All the time you 've had to sit and wait . Because of all the times you 've made other people miserable . " <p> Tony 's laugh was quiet . " Well , maybe that 's why I 'm here , big brother . I 'm your punishment . For all those things you did . " He narrowed his eyes at Richard . " Veras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sense . " <p> Ellen stood up and put her hand on Richard 's shoulder . " Oh , I do n't know , " she said , trying to smooth everything over . " I figure it does n't matter so much where you end up so long as you do something in life . " <p> " My philosophy exactly . Life is like a train . You may as well enjoy the ride . " Tony grinned at her and sat back down . " And that 's just what I plan on doing . " <p> The sudden shift of perspective , how he turned everything around , that 's what bothered her . She sat on the arm of Richard 's chair . " I hope things work out for you , " she told him . But she knew he heard something else : Do n't fuck us over . Ever again . <p> " Tony could stay clean , " Richard said , " if only he had a memory . " <p> He was lying in bed when he said this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to his , and she smelled like rosewater , clean , but not sweet . It was the same soap his family had used when he was a child , and so he did n't know what made him feel calm , Ellen next to him , or the scent-not that it mattered . What mattered was that he felt calm , cared for , part of someone else 's life . As he had as a child . As he did every night when she slid into bed . That 's what he meant about Tony . There were things that provided continuity , scents were one of them , memory another , and continuity gave you a home , not only in the world , but in the larger scheme of things . <p> Ellen rolled over , facing him . His breathing was so quiet , she thought he had fallen asleep , but he was lying on his back , his eyes open in the dim light from the window . <p> " But he never remembers anything . Or it 's all twisted somehow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the way he was talking about Jenna . He gets out expecting everything to pick up where he left off . All those years , zap , they 're gone . " For Tony , she thought , there was only the moment . No past , no future . Maybe prison was like dope in that way : you went into another world , time stopped , you came out blinking your eyes . <p> She ran her fingertips up and down Richard 's bare chest . It was sad , all so sad . Tony had taken the rap for Jenna so she could take care of their little girl ; then she gave Stephie to her mother and turned her back on him . Like that . His sacrifice meant nothing . Tony , living in that cell for five years , no one to touch him in tenderness . What did that do to a person , she wondered , not only the deprivation of the natural world-sky , sun , wind , plants-but of human touch ? A kind word . Someone to confide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked suddenly . " We do n't have the kind of things he would steal . " <p> " I do n't know about you , " Richard whispered , " but I 'm afraid he 'll start again . And then we 'll lose him , " he said . " I 'm afraid he 's going to die . " <p> She wished she could be as good as Richard , but she could fore see a time where Tony 's death might seem inevitable . A relief , even . And , yes , she knew why Richard felt guilty . They had done their share of experimentation , but they 'd never hurt anyone . <p> " God , " he said , " God , I regret those years . " <p> " What does that mean ? " she asked him . " That you would go back and change your life if you could ? You would be somebody else ? " <p> He 'd always told her , If my parents had just stayed in the barrio , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends from junior high . But no , they moved us to the east side , to the white schools , to keep us out of trouble , give us opportunities , and what did we do ? We started hanging out with guys like Reid . That 's what drugs do . When you 're an outsider , they give you instant community . <p> She tried to see herself as someone other than who she was , someone who had made other choices , but she could n't . She could see herself leaning against a wall at school ; she was very thin and very smart . She never had to study . She was wearing black , always black T-shirts and navy bell-bottoms ; her hair was long and frizzy . She was lost in an opium dream . The other girls walked by in their villager skirts and button-down blouses and Capezios . They carried their pompoms . They giggled when the boys talked , tilted their heads , gazed up at them . But that had never been Ellen 's dream . Ellen had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wanted to be different . Daring . A risk-taker . In her dream , a blue car sped down a curved mountain highway , the ocean on one side , cliffs on the other , the car gliding around the corners . She touched the steering wheel ever so slightly , her hand on the wheel , her long fingers light on the leather , she could almost think the car around the corners . <p> And then , there was another image , this one from memory : she and Jenna are backing out of Reid 's driveway . They 're loaded , Ellen 's driving . Jenna has just lit a cigarette and handed it to her . Tony comes out to say goodbye , and Jenna and Ellen say , high as anything , Do n't start , Tony , do n't ever start . In the rearview mirror , Ellen sees Richard , tall and thin , hair past his shoulders . He 's come over to Reid 's house to score . Richard . She knows he 's Tony 's older brother , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , how shy they are . The Garcia brothers are both standing next to her car , and that 's what she sees , Richard 's eyes . <p> Tony , Jenna says , do n't do it . And yet only a few days later he 's sitting in the back seat of a Chevy , and Ellen 's kneeling on the front seat , facing him . He 's wrapped the belt around his arm and pumped up , and Reid sticks the needle in Tony 's vein . Pulls the plunger back , the blood surges in dark red , then Reid pushes the plunger forward . Ellen 's watching Tony 's face , waiting to see his eyes pin ; waiting , impatiently , for her own rush . <p> Tony , the last to try it , the first to get strung out . Within a year , he had black marks snaking down his arms . This is important , she thought , it explains our guilt . Or why our complicity feels like guilt . <p> She pressed her face to Richard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her at night , she settled in , felt her body all along his , the edge of her self melting into him . Osmosis . He made her feel calm . She exhaled . She felt it . The exhale . Relief . She must have been holding her breath ever since they 'd heard Tony was getting out . <p> Richard could n't sleep . He kept replaying the eruptions of Tony 's anger . Everything was a struggle . Twice Tony had taken a swing at him . Richard was beginning to wonder if it had been a mistake to give him a job , but there was no point in telling Ellen any of this . Although , he supposed , if he lost the job , he might have to tell her . <p> Shit , he could n't afford to lose this job . And all because of Tony 's temper . But it had n't been Tony 's fault . Not really . The woman had yelled at him first . Actually , she had yelled at this chapato landscaper , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak much English . Maybe not much Spanish . Looked Indian . Richard remembered that he had walked over to the edge of the roof as soon as he 'd heard her voice , afraid , immediately , that Tony had done something . He 'd leaned over the parapet wall to get a clearer view . But it had n't been Tony . There the woman stood , the homeowner , in her turquoise running suit and gold sandals , towering over the landscaper . She was berating him , pointing first at a trench , then at plants someone had trampled , and then right in his face . The landscaper stood , arms folded across his chest , watching her impassively . His calm expression and lack of response was probably making her blood pressure go up by the second . <p> The confrontation would have ended soon after . That 's what usually happened . The homeowners just liked to blow off steam . Or maybe they thought complaining would get them some extras . They hated to pay for the extras , especially the ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd tell them to take it up with the contractor , then the contractor would yell at you . Thing was , they still had to pay , and the more they had to pay , the more they wanted to make you pay . So you had to fucking take it . You had to stand there and let them know , that yes , you understood the hierarchy . They had more money than you did , which meant they had more power , which meant they got to be rude . Being rude was part of their privilege . Of course , Tony knew all that as well as he did , but Tony had always made it a point not to buy into any system . <p> " Look , " Tony had pointed to the landscaper 's truck , " he plants plants . " He was speaking very slowly and patiently as if the woman had an IQ of about ten . " He does n't trample plants . And he does n't dig trenches . " <p> Even before Richard had seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too late . He would n't be able to get off the roof quickly enough . He watched the landscaper make a quick exit . It was just the woman and Tony now , the trench-thank God for the trench-between them . <p> She 'd leaned forward and jabbed her finger at Tony . " Well , then , who did it ? " <p> " Satan , " Tony had hissed , narrowing his eyes . " Satan did it . " <p> The woman 's face had gone momentarily slack from surprise , but she recovered . " We 'll see , " she snapped . She stalked back towards her house . <p> " Satan ? " Richard had asked when he finally made it down the ladder . " Satan ? Tucson Power dug the trench . " <p> " Oh , really , Richard ? You sure ? " <p> " Fuck , Tony , you ca n't go yelling at the homeowners . Even if they are idiots . " <p> " Did I yell ? " he 'd yelled . " You call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard had looked over at the woman 's house . <p> " You fucking calm down ! " Tony had then stomped off the job . <p> Richard could n't believe it . He climbed back up the ladder . He was going to have to try to finish alone . Of course . And , of course , soon after the incident , a truck had pulled up in the driveway . It was Earl , the project supervisor , laconic and weary , made weary by a job Richard would have hated even more than his own . <p> " So , " Richard had said , when Earl came back out of the woman 's house , " you the clean-up crew ? " <p> " She swears you got up in her face and threatened her . " Earl raised his hand to stop Richard 's objections . " I know . I know you . And I know this woman . But she threatened to call the cops . She wants you off the job . Now . " <p> " I 'll leave when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . " Earl looked at her house . " Tough shit , lady . " He lifted his cap and scratched his head . " ' Course you know I 'll hear about this from Tom . " <p> " Sorry . But there is n't a whole hell of a lot I can do about it now . " <p> As Richard walked Earl over to the truck , he 'd told him the story . Earl had laughed , " No wonder . " Then he climbed in and rolled the window down . " Piece of advice , " he 'd said , " do n't let your brother near the homeowners . Tattoos scare ' em , and they sure do n't want to hear about Satan . " <p> Richard could n't sleep . Satan ? He got out of bed and walked down to the living room and turned the TV on , no sound . The shadows flickered on the walls . Tony talked about Satan all the time now . He 'd become a Jesus junkie . Well , no atheists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he get to be so sanctimonious ? A lie weighs the same as murder . He actually said things like that . Told Richard he 'd done time for him , washed away his sins . Ellen 's , too . Not to mention Jenna 's . And in some weird way , Richard knew , he bought into it . He 'd often had this idea that he should have gone instead . <p> The Welcome Home party was just family . Ellen was playing the good hostess . She put a pitcher of margaritas on the table . " Anything else ? " she asked . " Before I sit down ? " <p> Tony tapped a pack of cigarettes and said , " Come on , Artie boy , push those chips to the center of the table . You 're not afraid of losing , are you ? " <p> He and Richard were sitting at the table with the older sister , Grace , and her husband , Art . They were playing five-card draw . Art had a poker face , the gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of those guys who was really good with horses because of some mystical affinity , maybe . And Grace , willful and strong , her thick black hair and long legs , coltish even in her late twenties , was-like Richard always said-the horse even Arturo would never be able to tame . <p> Art tipped back . He took his time , pushing one chip at a time , slowly , into the pot . <p> In the kitchen , the younger sister , Amelia , was making potato salad , slicing black olives into the bowl . She was as small and thin as she had been as a girl , less than one hundred pounds , and yet she had given birth to two nine-pound babies . Her husband , Victor , said they inflated upon delivery . Her three-year-old son was pulling on her shirt . Patience , Manny , she said , and then put an olive on each of his index fingers . <p> Once , before Tony got sent up , when he ripped off their mother 's house , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nina had given her for her first Holy Communion , a pair of jade earrings , and a wooden box her nino had brought home from the Philippines . Still , she forgave him without question , as everyone always did , came to the party and made potato salad , and when Tony asked her what she was going to be when she grew up , she just laughed and said , I am grown up . <p> Once , Ellen had told him , with every person you hurt , you hurt yourself . They are what hold you in this world . But he always managed to turn it around : they had never let him into their world , he said . <p> Tony was saying that he did n't like Salvadorans . " There was this one in jail , cut off a guy 's hand with a machete . " <p> " Why 'd he do that ? " Daniel asked , sitting down . <p> " When they threw him in the holding tank with us , " Tony said , lighting a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat him up bad . Not the pigs . These guys at a bar . They took him in the John , beat the shit out of him , and ripped him off . It was n't the first time , either . " <p> " Sounds like a bright guy , " Ellen said , looking at Daniel 's face . She wondered if she should let him listen to all of this . " Keeps going back for more . " <p> Tony blew out a stream of smoke and said , " You wan na hear what happened ? " <p> Grace made a disgusted sound . " Not really . " <p> She was studying Tony . Now that he and Jenna were seeing each other , she was sure he was going to start using again . They all knew the signs . His eyes changed color , to green , and got all pinned when he was loaded . His voice got husky . And then , there would be the more obvious signs , marks on his arms , money borrowed and never paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but whenever anything was missing , the assumption was as quick and accurate as a heartbeat : Tony . <p> " So this Salvadoran decides he 's not gon na let them push him around . This dude was maybe five-two , a little sucker , and he goes home and gets his machete . When he comes back , these dudes are still in the bar , drinking up his money , and he goes up to one of them and pulls the machete out . Well , the guy stands up and tries to shield his head , like so , " Tony held his arm in front of his face , " and the machete slices the guy 's hand in two , like that , man . Clean . All the fingers gone , the thumb cut in half . " <p> Ellen tried not to see the stump or the blood , but her mind worked that way , she could see everything . Not only that , but it brought to her mind all the things he 'd seen and heard and told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw kerosene or something in another con 's cell , then a match , and the guy 's a fireball , locked in , everyone else shouting and banging on the bars , afraid the fire will spread . And another time , how Tony had to shank this guy , a friend on the outside , to prove his loyalty to la familia . <p> Tony , they had said , what happened in there does n't matter , it 's a different world . <p> But , of course , it did matter . Now that he had been out for a while , it was obvious . What had happened and , especially , what he had done to survive it weighed him down , kept him there , away from the rest of the family . <p> " You wan na play , you 're gon na pay . That it , Tony ? " Richard tapped his cards on the table . <p> " Anyways , they throw this guy in the tank with us , and he wants to plead self-defense . I tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're gon na bury you . " <p> " So ? " Richard asked . " Did he cop a plea ? " <p> " Yeah . He got five years . " Tony laughed and ground out his cigarette . " One year for each finger . " <p> Art shook his head . " Sounds heavy , " he said . He stretched , cracked his knuckles . " Time for some serious poker . " <p> Tony smiled his slow smile . " Get ready to lose . " <p> " Oooh , " Daniel said , " I 'm scared . " <p> " So , " Tony asked Daniel , " you always wear nail polish ? " <p> Daniel shook his bangs out of his eyes and gave Tony a coy look . He had let Rachel practice on him that afternoon . Dark red on his right hand , blue on the left . Ellen remembered them sitting in a square of light on the living room floor . Daniel was watching cartoons . She thought Rachel had even done his toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " Do n't you like the color ? " <p> In one swift movement , Tony was standing . He had whipped Daniel out of his chair and was holding him upside down by his legs . <p> " You know what they call people like that ? " <p> " The purple is my favorite , " he lisped , still laughing . <p> " Fags . " <p> " Okay , Tony , " Richard said . <p> But Daniel was not scared . " You should see my toes , " he howled . <p> " Enough , " Ellen said , frowning at him in warning . Why did he have to be such a clown ? <p> " Give it a rest , " Grace said . " The kid 's gon na be an actor . " <p> " You know what happens to them in prison ? " Tony shook his head as if he were thoroughly disgusted . He deposited Daniel back in his chair and sat down in his own . " All I 'm saying 's he should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Ellen asked . <p> Tony shrugged : Oh , well . I tried . He picked up Grace 's toddler , Annie , and let her hold his cards . Told her which ones to discard , and she slapped them on the table . <p> Dealer 's choice . Daniel called five-card draw , one-eyed jacks wild , and jokers wild in straights and flushes . <p> Tony leaned back in his chair . " Where are Victor and Amelia ? Do n't tell me they 're keeping their mota to themselves . " <p> Grace said , " Amelia is in the kitchen . Pass me the ashtray . " <p> Tony persisted . " Victor and Berto and that guy they brought with them , they 're out back toking up , right ? Why not spread the wealth around ? " <p> They all looked out the sliding glass door , at Victor , Amelia 's husband , and his brothers , Berto and Chito . They were all huddled in a circle around the brick barbeque , drinking beer . They were dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore their hair long and shaggy or in ponytails with baseball caps . All except Victor , who had style , who wore his hair short on top and long in back . Que suave , ese , Richard and Art teased him . Victor passed a joint and then turned his attention back to flipping the steaks . <p> Grace said , " If you want to smoke , go outside . Nobody 's stopping you . " <p> Art said , " Notice the muscles on that landscaper today ? Ever seen a chick with pecs like that ? " <p> Tony 's voice got this edge . " You trying to tell me that this kid 's never seen anyone smoke pot ? " <p> " Como chingas . " Richard put his cards down . " I 'm sure he has . " He looked at Daniel . " Have you ? " <p> Daniel grinned . " Nah , never . " <p> " Okay , Tony ? " Richard 's voice was soft . " Bastante . " <p> Tony stood up , bumping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cards in front of Richard and made his voice just as soft . " Fuck you . We 're not at work . Do n't tell me what to do . " <p> On his way out , he punched the living room wall , and the dry-wall gave , a small fist like indentation . The front door slammed . It was quiet except for the sound of the younger children playing in Rachel 's bedroom , the fan whirring through the smoky light over the table . <p> " Temper , temper-huh , Daniel ? " Amelia shook her head at him . She was standing in the doorway to the kitchen , wiping her hands on a dishtowel . Richard fished the wet cards out of the beer . <p> Ellen looked at the dent in the wall . Someday , she thought , we 'll have little shelves and pictures in odd places all over our house , just like Richard 's mom does , covering all the places where Tony got mad . <p> Art shook his head . " Hope you guys like knickknacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art began the soft shuffling . <p> Grace looked at Richard . " You and Tony never could get along . " <p> " Sure , Grace , it 's my fault . " <p> She waved her hand in the air , forget it . Then said to Daniel , " Did your dad ever tell you how your uncle Tony used to spend a half hour every morning before school combing his hair ? " <p> Daniel shook his head . <p> " There were six of us-four kids ! - and one bathroom , and he took forever . So when he finally did come out , hair just so , your dad used to , " she reached over and tousled Daniel 's hair , " do that . And then Tony , crying , would chase him all the way to school . " <p> Richard shook his head . " Remember that game we used to play with the rope , where we held it and the other kids ran and jumped over it ? But when it was Tony 's turn , we 'd yank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Richard both tipped back in their chairs and laughed . Rachel placed a plate of food on the table in front of Ellen and then climbed up in her lap . " You going to share ? " Ellen whispered in her ear . Rachel tore a piece of tortilla , wrapped it around a chunk of barbequed steak , and offered her mom a bite . <p> " Or the time , " Richard said , " when he would n't help with the yard work and Grace and I got some of the neighbor kids to help us tie him up . We wanted to hang him upside down from the tree so he 'd agree to do the raking . " <p> Daniel looked shocked . " You hung him from a tree ? " <p> Grace laughed . " We tried , well . But he was too heavy . " <p> Richard pointed his beer at Daniel . " He asked for it . That was hard work , and he was just sitting there in the shade laughing at us for doing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right through my jeans , and that sucker would n't help . " <p> Richard sighed , clicked his pop top with his thumb . " Every goddamn thing , no matter how small , Tony 's got to tell me I do n't know what I 'm doing . He knows a better way , a faster way . Finally I told him , Look , I 've been doing this for years while you 've been sitting on your ass in prison . " <p> Art laughed . " Yeah , he sucks you into saying things like that , and then he says , Fine , fuck you , and walks off the job . " <p> Everyone was quiet , just the shuffling of the cards , a huge moth beating its wings against the glass door . Grace stirred her margarita with her finger , took a sip . " Give him some time . " <p> " Yeah , " Amelia said , " he 's only been out for a month . He 's got to adjust . " <p> Art got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time , " he said and shook his head , almost as if he were puzzled . " What the hell is more time gon na do ? " <p> " He talks about the joint like it 's home . You should hear him , the guys , the guys , the guys . " Richard tapped the table for emphasis . " They 're his family now . " <p> Grace and Amelia sighed at once . <p> " He 's changed , I 'm telling you . Hell , he thinks hot dogs from the 7-Eleven are good ! " <p> Art was the only one who laughed . It was the saddest thing he 'd heard yet . <p> " He got paid today . That 's why he was so anxious to leave . " Richard folded his cards and looked at Grace . " Do n't be thinking everything 's gon na be different . " <p> " Well , " Amelia said , " I 'm hiding my checks . " She looked around sheepishly . " I ca n't afford it , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " just listen to us . " <p> They all looked at one another . <p> " It is n't up to us , " Ellen said . <p> There was a longer silence , and Richard said , " Yeah , well , that 's true . " <p> Victor , with Amelia 's and his youngest slung over his shoulder , came in from the back . He wore his T-shirt , a black one that proclaimed Good but not Cheap ! , stretched tight over his muscles . " Where 'd Tony go ? " he asked . " What 'd you guys do to him this time ? " <p> They all shook their heads and laughed . Art nodded his head at Richard . " Ask him . It 's his fault . " <p> Daniel and Rachel had been absolutely quiet during the whole conversation . Ellen guessed they would learn that there were consequences , certain things you should never try or do or say . Maybe . She hoped that 's what they would learn . Maybe they would learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when Daniel started asking Grace to tell more stories-about the old house , the old neighborhood-Ellen guessed that maybe knowing too much too soon was scary , too . Just as scary as the silence she had struggled to decipher as a child . <p> " Was n't Beatrice a witch ? " he asked Grace . <p> " That 's what they say , " she said . " They found a trunk in her house when she died , and it was full of books about black magic and full of dolls . " She looked around at the kids . " You know the kind they stick pins in ? When her son found these things , your tata told him to take them to the priest . " <p> " Once Beatrice gave us these little sacks of herbs , remember , Grace ? " Amelia said . " And she hung them on strings around our necks . We both got really high fevers . I kept dreaming about these women walking around our bed . Women in white gowns . Chanting . Every now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us like they wanted us to come with them . " She shivered . " I knew they were dead . " She shivered again . " We were so sick , and my mom did n't know what to do . But when my dad saw the sacks of herbs , he took them and burned them . Right away , our fevers broke . Remember , Grace ? " <p> " That 's not all , " Grace said . " When I was going over to Beatrice 's , the things I said in anger would come true . For instance , once when Richard refused to give me a ride , I said , I hope you get a flat tire . And he got one . And once , when I was mad at Tony , I went over and put my hand , just my fingertips , really , on the windshield of this car he was sitting in , and the windshield cracked . It was n't cold outside or nothing . It just cracked . " She made this face that said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back against Ellen 's chest as if she 'd like to disappear inside her . The other children were gathered around the room , their eyes shining , especially Grace 's oldest , Andi , who kept saying , Tell us a story , Mom , not a memory . <p> " Okay , one , " Grace said . The younger children were drifting off to sleep on a quilt she 'd spread on the floor in the living room . She looked over at them and then at Andi and Daniel and Rachel , she narrowed her eyes and made her voice low , almost as low as a whisper . " This story is about a girl who wants to go to the dance so badly that she threatens her mother . She says , I do n't care what you say , I 'm going anyways . And her mother threatens her back . If you go , mi'jita , she tells her , I 'll lock you out . Do n't think I wo n't . The girl shrugs , she does n't believe her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's there , she dances with this very handsome stranger , a man no one has ever seen before , a man no one else will dance with . And they dance all night , twirling around and around , and then , just after the last song , when she turns to say goodbye , he 's disappeared . On the way home , she wonders if she 'll ever see him again . It 's very dark , and it 's a long way home , and just as she 's passing some bushes , she thinks she feels someone walking behind her . She stops , she hears footsteps . Then she turns , and she thinks she sees these red eyes in the darkness , she feels his hot breath . She begins to run faster and faster . Still he 's behind her . Faster and faster , she runs . Finally , she reaches her door , but it 's locked . She knocks and knocks at the door , she calls for her mother , but her mother wants to teach her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listens and listens to her daughter 's cries , to her scratching at the door , but , still , she wo n't let her in . Finally , her daughter is silent . And the mother , thinking she 's learned to obey her , opens the door . But her daughter is nowhere to be found . There 's no trace of her . No blood , no clothing , no tracks . Nothing . Only the door is torn to shreds . The mother calls out to her . There 's no answer . She calls to her neighbors for help , and they all call and call for the girl and search for her , but no one ever sees her again . <p> " You know , " Grace said , looking right into their eyes , one by one , " they say the Santa Cruz used to run all year round . They say there used to be a lake there , in Carrillo Gardens , where the dance was held , but after that night , after the girl danced with the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what your nana told me , anyways . She told me they never had any dances after that . " <p> Rachel had Ellen 's hands pressed firmly over her ears . Ellen cupped her palm and whispered beneath it , " I will never lock you out , mi'ja . " <p> As Ellen looked at the sleepy faces of the children , at Grace and Amelia as they lifted their sleeping kids and murmured to them , It 's all right , sshh , it 's all right , she could see what Grace had always seen : there was no way they could give up on Tony . The feeling was , if the fabric of the family held together , they could somehow keep him among the living . But it was n't just for his sake . Grace wanted the family to stay whole for all of them , for the children . Like her mother , she believed in holding the family together at any cost . One tear , and she was afraid it would all begin to unravel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
