Headnote Even doctors may not know the story of one of the most dramatic advances in the annals of medicine , the introduction of insulin . On morning rounds Peter Mance , one of the interns in Medical Intensive Care Unit ( MICU ) . presented a 30-year-old woman admitted the night before with diabetic coma and ketoacidosis . The patient had developed gastroenteritis two days earlier and stopped taking her daily insulin injections . Dr. Mance had stayed up with his dehydrated , acidotic patient most of the night , balancing her blood glucose and acid levels with the proper amount of insulin and fluids . Before the insulin era , she would probably not have survived hospitalization . Now modern medicine-and a conscientious intern-had changed her condition from critical to stable in less than 12 hours . In diabetes the body 's normal supply of insulin is either absent or deficient . Without insulin , a hormone made by the pancreas , glucose can not enter the cells and be used as energy . Without insulin , glucose accumulates " outside " the cells , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood glucose level may range from normal to over 10 times normal . Ketoacidosis , the most extreme state of uncontrolled diabetes , results from a sudden and severe lack of insulin ; glucose builds up rapidly in the blood , to dangerously high levels . To forestall starvation , the cells turn to abundant fat as an alternative fuel . Metabolism of fat , less efficient than that of glucose , causes a buildup of harmful acid products called keto acids-hence the term diabetic ketoacidosis , or DKA . The hallmark of DKA is an excess of acids and glucose in the blood . DKA patients are very dehydrated because the extra blood glucose spills into the urine along with a large amount of the body 's water . Glucose , a type of sugar , is not normally present in urine . " Tasting the urine " was an early way to diagnose diabetes ( not a test of modern medicine ) . The full name of the disease is from an early description in Latin that referred to the urine : diabetes ( to pass through ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " textbook " case of DKA . Not every MICU patient has to have triple organ failure or present ungodly ethical dilemmas . This patient , at least , presented a straightforward problem amenable to therapy . She also provided an opportunity to teach some medical history . We went in to see her , a pleasant Puerto Rican woman named Carlita Gomez . Mrs. Gomez looked and acted normal , which in itself was remarkable . From just her appearance , you would not know how sick she was a day earlier . " How do you feel ? " I asked . " Much better , doctor . " " What happened that you had to come to the hospital ? Did you forget to take your insulin ? " " No . Two days ago I began vomiting and was sick to my stomach . I did n't eat , so I did n't take my insulin yesterday or the day before . " " Why did n't you come to the hospital right away , when this all started ? " " I thought it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday I got much worse and came to the emergency room . " " What made you finally decide to come yesterday ? " " I felt very dizzy and sick . My boyfriend said 1 looked very bad and he brought me . " " Peter , " I said , " can you describe what she looked like on admission ? " " 1 saw her about 20 minutes after she arrived to the emergency room . She was very somnolent . I had to arouse her to answer questions , but she was lethargic and could n't give me any information except her name . " " Was she short of breath ? " " Well , she did n't look like an acute asthmatic or anything , but her breathing was rapid and deep . " Rapid and deep , the classic breathing pattern in DKA , is the body 's attempt to balance the excess keto acids by hyperventilation , or " blowing them off . " The other classic symptom , excessive urination , causes great thirst and water ingestion . " Mrs. Gmez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . I must have drank 20 glasses of water yesterday and the day before . I could n't seem to get enough water . " " I bet you went to the bathroom a lot , too . " " Yes . " " Has this ever happened to you before , that you had to come to the hospital for your diabetes ? " " I once came to the emergency room with the flu , and they said my blood sugar was high , but 1 did n't have to stay in the hospital . " " How long have you had diabetes ? " " Since I was 21 . " " Have you taken insulin that long , for ten years ? " " Yes . " " Does anybody else in your family have diabetes ? " " My mother , but she just uses antidiabetici pills . She does n't need insulin . " " Who 's at home with you ? " " My kids . I 'm divorced . " " How old are they ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , ten . " " Did you have any problems with the pregnancies ? " " No . They were both heavy babies , though . The doctors said that was because of my diabetes . " " Who 's taking care of the children while you 're in the hospital ? " " My mother . " " Do your kids have diabetes ? " " No , not as far as I know . They seem to be fine . " Further history revealed that Mrs. Gmez was followed in our hospital 's diabetes clinic , that she was compliant with her insulin therapy , and that she did not suffer from the potential ravages of the disease , such as kidney failure and vascular disease . She supported herself with income from the state 's Aid to Dependent Children program and some help from her mother . We attributed her exacerbation to nonspecific gastroenteritis , an inflammation of the stomach and intestines probably caused by a virus . She stopped taking insulin because she could n't eat , but this only accelerated the vicious cycle leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's detailed charting of insulin dose and blood test results . In the emergency room , Mrs. Gomez 's blood glucose was 948 milligrams , over nine times the normal value of 80 to 100 milligrams . Her bicarbonate level was only six , about a quarter normal and indicative of severe acidosis ( the lower the bicarbonate , the more acid is in the blood ) . Dr. Mance 's meticulous chart showed that both glucose and bicarbonate levels were returning toward normal , a direct result of insulin and fluid therapy . " Let 's see . She 's now receiving two units of insulin an hour , right ? " " Right , " said Dr. Mance . " And her blood glucose is down to 240 and bicarbonate up to 19 ? " " Yes , those are the latest values , " he affirmed . " Well , it looks like she 's on her way to complete recovery . You 've done a good job , Peter . " Turning to Mrs. Gomez , I asked , " How 's your stomach ? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better , " she said . " I think I 'd like to eat something . " " Peter , let 's start her on a soft diet and advance to regular food if she tolerates that . " I thanked Mrs. Gomez and we stepped outside her room to continue the discussion . " We should be able to switch her to subcutaneous insulin later today the method of insulin delivery she used at home . Let 's keep her in MICU until she 's off the intravenous insulin . " " OK . " I turned to address the medical student , Sarah Miles , a bright and energetic woman about five years younger than Mrs. Gomez . " A fairly typical case of DKA , do n't you think , Sarah ? Have you had a chance to read about her problem ? " " Yes . I read about it last night . " " Good . You worked her up with Dr. Mance , right ? " " Yes . " Sarah was on call the night before and had stayed up to help manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I read that DKA patients typically present with hyperventilation and stupor , and that reversal is fairly rapid with treatment , which always consists of fluids and insulin . " That 's right . What did doctors do with these patients before insulin was available ? Anybody know ? " There was no answer . " Starvation , " I said . " Doctors prescribed starvation diets to their diabetic patients . Unfortunately , without Insulin , almost everyone with ketoacidosis died . How long has insulin been available ? Did your book mention that bit of history , Sarah ? " " No . I did n't see that , " she replied . " Well , how old are you , if you do n't mind my asking ? " Twenty-four . " " Was insulin around when you were born , in 1965 ? " " I think so , " she said , perhaps wondering what the question had to do with our patient . " Well , was insulin around in 1955 ? " Bill Sedgwick , the other intern on rounds , spoke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1955 . " He spoke with assurance , as if he really knew the answer . " Bill , " I said in a congratulatory tone , " do you play Trivial Pursuit ? " " Sometimes , " he said . " Anybody disagree with Bill ? " I asked . No one answered . Everyone seemed to agree 1955 was when insulin became available . If so , they were only off by three decades . Ignorance about this seminal event in medicine was n't their fault , if it could even be called a fault . " History of medicine " as a subject is almost never taught in American medical schools . Even the historical aspects of everyday diagnosis and therapy are usually omitted . One principal reason is that the teachers are themselves often ignorant or uninterested , and that 's too bad . Doctors interested in history know that it helps provide perspective and humility in daily practice . It teaches us that today 's " correct " therapy may be viewed as wrongheaded nonsense by future generations , much as we view primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical events can also be of practical Importance . For example , antltuberculosls drug therapy was only Introduced In the late 1940s . Anyone who contracted TB before then could not possibly have received effective drug therapy , yet on more than one occasion I 've been told on rounds , by some well-meaning medical resident , that a patient received TB drugs " In the 1930s or early 1940s . Another time a house officer related a patient 's treatment for Legionnaire 's disease to a year before the disease was first described ( 1976 ) ! Even local history is important . A patient could not have had a CAT scan before the machine was available ( in our hospital , 1978 ) , yet I have been presented with the verbal reports of such phantom scans . Like any history , of course , medicine 's is far more than dates . The pioneering work of Banting , Best , Macleod and Collip in insulin , of Koch in tuberculosis , of Pasteur in rabies , and of Enders and SaIk in polio vaccine , can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakthroughs are invariably full of scientific excitement and human drama ( and are well told in numerous books , such as Paul de Kruif s Microbe Hunters , Michael Bliss 's The Discovery of Insulin , and James Watson 's The Double Helix . Still , it would be helpful if young physicians knew a few important dates . " Nineteen twenty-two , " I said . " Insulin was introduced into clinical medicine in 1922 . " " Oh , well , " said Bill Sedgwick , suggesting by his tone that it really did n't matter whether it was 1922 or 1955 . " The first patient to receive insulin was a 14-year-old diabetic boy named Leonard Thompson . In what city ? " I asked . If they did n't know the date they also would not know the location of this medical milestone , but I was having fun and they did n't seem to mind . " Boston , " guessed Dr. Sedgwick . " No . " " New York , " said Dr. Miles . " London ? " said one of the nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone give up ? " AU did . Toronto . The Toronto General Hospital , January 11 , 1922 . And who received a Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin ? " " Banting , " said Dr. Sedgwick , who was still out to win the trivia prize . " You 're half right , " I said . " Banting who ? " That 's his last name . I do n't remember his first name . " No answer . " How about Best ? Banting and Best , does that ring a bell ? " The two names , of course , are forever linked with the discovery of insulin . Even many grade-school students have heard of Banting and Best . That 's right , " said Dr. Sedgwick . " Banting and Best . I remember now . " " Yes , " said Dr. Mance . " I remember , too . Banting and Best , but I do n't remember their first names or anything about them . " " Actually , they are names you probably heard before you entered medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nobel Prize , I bet . SaIk and Sabin got the Nobel Prize for the polio vaccine , and Banting and Best got it for insulin . Right ? " There was general murmur of agreement . " Does anyone disagree ? " If my questions seemed obnoxious , no one complained . In any case I felt compelled to continue , especially since no one had disagreed with my purposely erroneous statement about SaIk , Sabin , and Best . " Well , for starters , Sabin and SaIk did not win the Nobel Prize . " " No ? Sure they did , " said Dr. Sedgwick . That ca n't be . " " Sure they did n't . They developed and introduced the polio vaccines but never got a Nobel Prize for their work . The Prize was given for earlier work on culturing the poliovirus in monkey kidney cells , work that was published in 1949 . So who got the Prize for work on polio ? " Now they were baffled . I was asking a bit of trivia they must have missed In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nobel Prize was awarded to three Americans , Drs . Enders , Robbins , and Weller , in 1954 , before the polio vaccine was even released . They were the ones who developed a method to culture the poliovirus . Without their work , there would have been no vaccine . " " Really ? " " Really . And it was in Boston , too . " " Are you sure SaIk and Sabin never got the Nobel Prize ? " asked Dr. Sedgwick , still unbelieving . " I 'm sure . They got just about every other prize , but not the one from Stockholm . " " What about Banting and Best ? Did n't they get it for discovering insulin ? " " Yes and no . That 's an interesting story , " I said . " Anybody want to hear it ? " I was n't sure anyone did , but I wanted to tell it . It is one of the more fascinating stories of medical discovery . " Yes , " said one of the nurses . Tell us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trace of sarcasm , I suddenly felt a need to defend the subject of medical history . Looking toward the patient I said , There 's more to a case like this than just glucose and bicarbonate levels . Sometimes we take these modern miracles too much for granted . Since you insist , I 'll tell you about the discovery of insulin . " And I did . Before 1922 young diabetics were treated with low-carbohydrate , starvation diets . Even so , patients with DKA invariably died in coma . William Osier , in his 1892 The Principles and Practice of Medicine , a standard textbook of the era , wrote : " In children the disease diabetes is rapidly progressive , and may prove fatal in a few days .. . as a general rule , the older the patient at the time of onset the slower the course .. . in true diabetes instances of cure are rare .. . Our Injunctions today are those of Sydenham an earlier physician ) : Let the patient eat food of easy digestion , such as veal , mutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fruit and garden stuff . The carbohydrates in the food should be reduced to a minimum . " Reflecting medical practice of the day , Osier 's text devotes almost a full page to specific dietary recommendations , listing those items that the diabetic may take and those that were prohibited . Among the latter was " ordinary bread of all sorts . " Osier 's comment on " medicinal treatment " of diabetes was an understatement : " This is most unsatisfactory , and no one drug appears to have a directly curative influence . " In fact , no drug was even Indirectly curative . On the subject of diabetic coma , Osier wrote : " The coma is an almost hopeless complication . " Frederick Banting was a 30-year-old surgeon from London , Ontario , who had the Idea of isolating the specific secretion of the pancreas that lowers glucose in the blood . By the end of World War I , scientists knew some substance in the pancreas acted to lower glucose , but no one had been able to Isolate it or use pancreatic extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1921 to work In the lab of Dr. John Macleod . a Scottish physiologist who was an expert in the field of carbohydrate metabolism . Banting was aided in his work by Charles Best , a 22-year-old medical student . The two of them succeeded In preparing an extract of pancreas that did lower blood sugar in dogs . This extract , of course , contained insulin . Under their direction the first human trial of insulin took place in January 1922 . ( History records earlier animal trials of crude pancreatic extract , most notably by a Georg Ludwig Zuelzer in Berlin , but nothing came of that research . ) Leonard Thompson weighed only 64 pounds when he was admitted to Toronto General In December 1921 . His diagnosis : diabetic ketoacidosis . He was Initially given a diet consisting of only vegetables see " A Case of Diabetes Mellitus , " New England Journal of Medicine . February 11 , 1982 . Before he received Insulin , Thompson 's blood sugar ranged from 350 to 560 milligrams . Thompson was still in the hospital when Banting and Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the first human to receive it . According to the hospital record , Thompson 's blood sugar fell from 470 to 320 milligrams six hours after the injection . It took Banting and Best two weeks to get more of the extract , and Thompson did n't receive his next injection until January 23 . His blood sugar responded by falling each time . Thompson continued to receive Insulin and was sent home on May 15 , 1922 , weighing 67 pounds . Almost from the very beginning , the discovery of insulin sparked controversy . Up until early 1922 , Macleod had played no direct role In the discovery . Although he had acted as advisor on a number of the experiments , and Banting and Best used his lab , Macleod was actually out of the country in the summer of 1921 when most of the important dog experiments were accomplished . The earliest scientific reports listed only Banting and Best as authors . In fact , Banting later wrote that he was discouraged in his work by Macleod , and that Macleod told him that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it became clear that an important discovery had been made , Macleod got involved and orchestrated the production of insulin and further research into Its use . At the time insulin was considered a cure for diabetes , so the discovery was quite a sensation . And no wonder . Patients near death were miraculously resurrected after only a few injections of the vital hormone . As expected , the discovery led to the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine . It was awarded in the fall of 1923 to Banting and ... Macleod ! Upon hearing of the award . Banting was furious . In his view , Macleod had done none of the original work but only impeded his own brilliant research . Banting thought Charles Best should have shared the Nobel Prize . Since Best was only a student at the time , and did not present any of the research at meetings , as did Banting and Macleod , his role in the discovery was not prominently featured . The Nobel committee was aware of Best ( he was coauthor on the original papers ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that he presented much of the research at scientific gatherings , one of which was attended by a Nobel committeeman . Also , by intention , the Nobel committee wanted to honor only two recipients ( it was not until 1 934 that three people would share a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ) . To the Nobel committee in Sweden , Banting and Macleod seemed the logical choices . Banting tried to correct the injustice by publicly giving half of his award to Best ( the total monetary award in 1923 was $17,000 ) . As it turns out , another scientist was also overlooked by the Nobel committee , a Toronto biochemist named J. B. Collip . Collip was responsible for purifying insulin far beyond what Banting and Best had achieved with their crude extract . In fact Collip had purified all the injections given the Thompson boy except the first one . After being apprised of Banting 's gesture , Macleod shared half of his prize money with Collip . For the next two decades there was bitter ( and private ) feuding among all four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that Macleod had hogged the limelight and deserved no credit for the discovery of insulin . Macleod thought Banting was an ungrateful young doctor who did n't appreciate how much he , the senior professor , had contributed to the discovery . Best , of course , was truly slighted by the Nobel Committee , and many contemporaries felt he should have been named a recipient of the Prize . At least Best 's contribution has been fully recognized by history , not to mention the University of Toronto . He outlived everyone in the story , dying in 1978 after a distinguished career as a professor of physiology . Collip also achieved long-lasting recognition for his pioneering work on purifying insulin . Macleod died in 1935 , in Scotland . As for Banting , he died in a plane crash in Newfoundland in 1941 . " Well , that 's enough about the discovery of insulin , " I said . " Anybody have any questions ? " " What happened to the boy who got the insulin ? " asked Dr. Sedgwick . " Oh , glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying in 1935 at age 27 , of severe bronchopneumonia . They did an autopsy and found the ravages of diabetes , including a shrunken pancreas . " Any more questions ?
