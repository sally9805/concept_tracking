By the time she turns 13 in February , Dakota Fanning will have appeared in 16 movies . Her two latest  --  an adaptation of the children 's classic Charlotte 's Web , in theaters this month , and the gritty indie Hound Dog , which will screen at the Sundance Film Festival in January  --  represent opposite ends of the young star 's growing oeuvre . Fanning told TIME 's Rebecca Winters Keegan about enduring her awkward stage , tackling grownup themes and selling Girl Scout cookies . <P> Who has been your messiest co-star : Tom Cruise , Denzel Washington , Sean Penn or the baby pig who plays Wilbur in Charlotte 's Web ? <P> Actually there were like 50 little pigs . We would get them when they were little , and during filming they would get too big . It 's a misconception about pigs that they 're dirty or messy or smelly . They 're really cute , and they do n't stink . I had a really great experience with them , and I 'd like to do it again some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messiest ? <P> No , definitely not ! None of the actors I 've worked with have been messy . <P> Your next film , tentatively titled Hound Dog , is about some very adult themes , including sexual abuse . Can you explain it ? <P> It 's about a young girl in the South . She has overcome some really hard things in her life through music  --  especially the blues and Elvis Presley . I have to sing a little bit in the movie . It 's the period where Elvis is touring in his pink Cadillac and starting to get really popular , so I had to learn about that . It stars Robin Wright Penn , David Morse , Piper Laurie . It 's about overcoming adversity and still being yourself and not having to change who you are . <P> This sounds very different from Charlotte 's Web , The Cat in the Hat and the other films that we think of as Dakota Fanning movies . <P> I 've been lucky to do all different kinds of movies , and what they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through hard things or fun things in their lives . One of my favorite movies is Gone With the Wind . And I loved The Devil Wears Prada . I like to watch all kinds of films , and it 's important to me to be in all different kinds of films too . <P> Will you be in Park City , Utah , at Sundance for the screening ? <P> Yeah , I 'm so excited . I 've never been somewhere where there 's that much snow . I totally want to go skiing . I 've heard skiing is superhard , but I 'd like to try it . <P> Are you at all protective of your little sister Elle , 8 , who has an acting career of her own now ? <P> She 's my baby sister and my best friend , and she just does her own thing . We 're different in many ways . My sister is totally a free spirit , wild and fun and funny . Me , I 'm more organized and proper . My sister , when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would put on the craziest outfits , whereas I stop to look at myself in the mirror before I go out . <P> You 're about to turn 13 , which for lots of people is an awkward age . Do you worry about going through that transition in front of the camera ? <P> There 's no stopping it . There 's nothing I can do about turning 13 . I do n't waste my time worrying about something I ca n't control . <P> You always seem so grownup . Do you feel more comfortable with adults or children ?
