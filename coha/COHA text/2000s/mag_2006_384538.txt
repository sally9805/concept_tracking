. IF YOU WANT TO CATCH MORE PANFISH , BASS , TROUT , AND WALLEYES THIS SUMMER , USE OUR EASY , NO-NONSENSE GUIDE TO THE BEST BAITS AND RIGS FOR EACH . PANFISH In this group of scrappy fighters , there 's a fish for every angler , from the cane-pole kid after a mess of sunnies to the hardcore panfisherman chasing suspended crappies . Unless you want to miss bites , your baits should be nearly as varied . Are you fishing from shore ? When panfish crowd shallow shoreline cover , one of the simplest routes to a fish fry is to meet them there with an old standby : a worm and a bobber . THE RIG : Thread a small garden worm onto a size 8 or 10 light-wire hook , letting just the very ends dangle . Attach a small fixed bobber to keep the bait 1-2 feet beneath the surface . Add a split shot and cast it to the edges and pockets of weedbeds , and around timber . Early in the season , drag it into visible spawning beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panfishing , crappie fishing is either very good or very bad . When these fish get finicky , some savvy anglers resort to ice-fishing baits : grubs and maggots . THE RIG : Hook a waxworm , mealworm , spike , or mousie to a small leadhead or teardrop jig . Work it around weeds , wood , and bottom structure , and vertically to suspended fish . Want a limit of open-water jumbos ? By far the most popular bait for perch and crappies topping 9 inches  --  and as big as 2 pounds or more  --  is the ubiquitous fathead minnow . THE RIG : Impale a 1- to 3-inch fathead through the lips on each hook of a tandem rig , weighted with a - ounce bell sinker . Jig , drag , drift , or slowly troll over submerged weeds , wood , or structure . BASS Lost in the flash and hype of the latest lures is the plain fact that one of the most reliable ways to land trophy bass is with bait . In fact , it 's a specialty of a number of guides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Below is a selection of deadly standbys on proven rigs keyed to the toughest conditions . Targeting black bass , stripers , and hybrids ? Gizzard shad are tops for landlocked stripers up to 60 pounds . Use threadfin for hybrids and black bass hitting schools of shad on the surface . THE RIG : For trophy stripers , drift or troll a 6- to 12-inch gizzard shad below a balloon float or on a slip-sinker rig . Rig a 6- to 7-inch bait on the latter for big largemouths . For hybrids , drift a 2- to 3-inch threadfin on a size 2 hook with a split shot or two . Cast a tail-hooked threadfin or a jig-and-shad combo at surface-blitzing black bass . At a loss when the lake fishing slows ? Hit the local smallmouth river with a can full of hellgrammites . Ugly and mean-spirited , these dobsonfly larvae will bite you given half a chance . Summer bronzebacks love to bite them . THE RIG : Run a size 4 or 6 hook under the collar of a hellgrammite . Add one or two split shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallmouths hold . Trying to fool pressured largemouths ? California 's trophy-bass fanatics , who 've been busy in recent years teaching the nation new ways to haul in scary-size fish , are now inching live nightcrawlers to catch giant , finicky bass . THE RIG : Impale a live nightcrawler through the head with a size 1 or 2 Octopus-style hook . Use no weight when possible ; otherwise add a small split shot or a drop-shot weight . Crawl the bait very slowly past visible bass or over promising bottom . Determined to land a lunker ? The all-around lunker largemouth bait is the golden shiner . It earned its reputation catching heavyweights in Florida , but it 's not particular about where it works . THE RIG : Hook a 4- to 10-inch shiner through the lips on a 3/0 to 6/0 hook , depending on the size of the bait , about 3 or 4 feet beneath a small fixed bobber . Slow-troll or drift it around shallow weedbeds . Or lose the bobber , add a split shot or two , and free-line around deeper structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream trout  --  forgetting their genteel nature  --  murder live bait . And in big rivers and sprawling lakes , the biggest trout that swim want nothing more than a generous helping of meat . For ruffians like you and me , it 's a tremendous opportunity . Use the rigs below to capitalize . Fishing the local creek ? You can catch stream trout with salted minnows , crayfish , and leeches , but day in and day out , nothing works better than a worm . And in high , cloudy water , few baits work half as well . THE RIG : Thread a whole garden worm ( or half a nightcrawler ) onto a size 8 or 10 hook ; cover the shank and leave the rest to dangle . Add a split shot and drift it naturally in the current . Trying to catch rising trout with live bait ? Put the worms away and break out the bugs . Rising trout will commonly snatch a live grasshopper or cricket drifted realistically overhead . It 's a great tactic in summer around overhanging vegetation . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size 10 or 12 light-wire hook . Using a casting bubble for weight , cast upstream of a rising fish and let the bait drift downstream . After trophy-size river trout ? The hands-down nastiest- looking baitfish that swims also happens to be the bar-none best big-trout bait in rivers  --  especially if you 're after trophy browns . THE RIG : Run a single size 4 hook through the lips of a sculpin or thread the bait on a double-needle sculpin hook . Add a split shot or two , stun or kill the little beast , then dead-drift it in the current . Trolling for big browns , rainbows , or lakers ? Although originally intended for and still deadly on Pacific salmon , cut and brined strips of herring have become one of the hottest trolling baits for big lake-dwelling trout . THE RIG : The easiest setup is a prepackaged bait-holder rig , like the Cut Bait Large Teaser by Rhys Davis ( 315-564-6814 ; ndtackle.com ) . It incorporates a leader , a plastic bait holder , and a treble hook . Troll the bait at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALLEYES For walleye anglers , it 's " Praise the Lord and pass the live bait . " That is , most are happy to indulge their quarry 's taste for live , juicy morsels . The only question is : Which morsel when ? Below are four great bait rigs that will keep you in the game under a variety of conditions , whether you 're planning a fish fry or targeting 10-pound trophies . Looking to clean up on river walleyes ? When the water under your boat is moving , you 'll be hard-pressed to beat a jig-and-minnow combo , particularly if you 're after spring walleyes . THE RIG : Tip a 1/8- to - ounce jig with a 2- to 3-inch fathead minnow . Jig vertically over deep structure ; cast and drift the bait below current breaks in shallower water . Obsessed with catching a 10-plus-pounder ? Rig up a 6-inch redtail chub . No , you wo n't catch as many fish on this behemoth walleye bait . But you may well catch a behemoth walleye , especially in the fall . THE RIG : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips or behind the dorsal fin with a 1/0 or 2/0 hook . Drift along steep breaklines , fishing the bait vertically below the boat . Trolling for finicky walleyes ? Casual walleye fishermen get going when the going gets tough . But the hardcore anglers stay put and catch fish by trolling fat nightcrawlers behind spinner rigs . THE RIG : Use a spinner rig together with a bottom bouncer for bottom-hugging walleyes . Trade the latter for a snap weight to target suspended fish . Are you spooking fish in skinny water ? When walleyes feed over shallow reefs or submerged vegetation in water less than 12 feet deep , back off with the boat and give them the slip  --  that is , sneak a leech in front of their faces with a slip-bobber rig . THE RIG : Hook a leech through the sucker with a size 6 hook under a slip bobber . Add a split shot or two , and attach a bobber stop for the appropriate depth . Use the wind or current to drift the bait to the fish . Or cast beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @                     @x The Odyssey <p> My plastic surgeon assures me that not only will the burns heal entirely but that since they were only first-degree my skin might become smoother and younger looking than before . Frankly I 'd rather have had the chemical peel . Cosmetic issues aside , it 's the internal wounds that trouble me more . Are they also first degree or will they prove beyond healing ? I suppose only the balm of time will tell . In the meantime while waiting to see the final results , I seldom stray from bed as I replay the drama of the last months over and over again . Though all the warnings were laid in front of me , they were too close for me to see them . Now each time I revisit the drama , it becomes clearer who the players were and who were merely chorus . But unfortunately , like all Greek tragedy , the outcome is always the same . <p> In retrospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of one to charter a hundred-and-twenty-foot yacht just for herself . At sixty thousand dollars a week . Plus gratuity . But my frivolity at the time was not without justification . Having chosen to spend the autumn in Europe while my penthouse underwent a renovation , I happened to be in Portofino the day a group of pathetic zealots commandeered four airplanes and crashed them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center , the Pentagon , and a field in Pennsylvania , killing untold numbers and propelling us mentally back to the Middle Ages . In the weeks following the disaster , nearly all my friends overseas decided to return stateside , turning the mood abroad so somber that I contemplated returning home myself . The problem was that with my apartment under construction , I had no home to return to . <p> That 's when Gianfranco entered the picture . I was strolling along the dock , wrestling over what course to take next , when I came upon him standing in the shadow of a sleek Benetti with the name Herakles stenciled in gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame draped in nautical whites , his sandy brown hair falling in loose curls along his face , and the regal profile of a Roman coin , he cut quite an Adonis-like figure . I stopped in pretense of admiring the yacht , and he engaged me in conversation , lamenting in broken English that his autumn charter had just been canceled . The Americans who had hired the Herakles for a tour of the antiquities were now too frightened to travel overseas . Perhaps I might be interested in such a charter ? A quick tour of the vessel ensued , and my dilemma of how to spend the next months was solved . I chartered the orphaned Herakles myself . And felt rather patriotic about it , I might add . What better way to show the terrorists that Pauline Cook was not about to buckle under to their agenda of fear than by continuing to lead a full life ? <p> I rushed back to the Splendido to settle my bill  --  a sum equal to the budget of a small third-world country  --  and soon thereafter my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel 's car . An hour later , I stood beside Gianfranco on the bridge of the yacht with a warm September breeze brushing my shoulders . As we watched the gentle hills of Portofino recede in the afternoon glow , my capitano assured me that I would never regret choosing to take this intimate tour . <p> " I will take-a you places you only dream of-a visit , " he promised . <p> And take me he did . We had n't made twenty nautical miles into the Adriatic when Gianfranco turned the wheel over to his first mate and escorted me belowdecks where he proved his sublimely tuned and tanned body to be more than seaworthy . For the next two and a half glorious months , certain all my interests at home were being looked after by competent parties , I gave little thought to the present-day world and immersed myself in the ancient one with Gianfranco as my captain , companion , and tour guide . <p> Together we explored the farthest reaches of the Hellenic and Roman empires . We visited Ilium , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek 's four-legged gift . We traipsed the ruins left by the Minoans at Knossos , often thought to be the lost civilization of Atlantis . We traveled to Actium where I felt the ghosts of Marc Antony and Cleopatra stir . When the weather grew cooler , we sailed south to Alexandria , the site of a library that once held 400,000 priceless scrolls whose ashes were now but dust in the wind . <p> And while the Herakles put in at one port after another , Gianfranco continued to put in at all points in between , a pastime I enjoyed as much , if not more , than the touring . Having breached the dreaded half-century mark over a year ago , I reveled in having a young paramour , though I did wonder what he would say if he knew he was making love to a woman nearly fifteen years his elder . Fortuitously , time had treated me well , and my skin did not reveal my age . This was the mixed blessing of growing up as a redhead who had to take shelter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summers of my youth were spent cowering beneath wide-brimmed hats and beach umbrellas while my peers cavorted gaily in the sun . Now while those same peers paid the price for their earlier freedom , having their faces pulled back to gather up the crevices carved out by youthful indiscretion , I gloried in the delayed benefits of my exile . <p> I had also been blessed with a trim figure , a benefit that comes along with standing five foot ten in one 's stocking feet . And since I never bore children , there were no untoward stretch marks to be dealt with either , though I must concede each year the drapery of my body seemed to hang slightly lower . But this seemed to matter naught to my young lover , who claimed his preferences ran to mature women , explaining that the ripe-a pear-a has the sweetest taste and finest perfume while an unripe pear is hard-a and no taste-a so good . <p> <br> Continues ...                    @
