Michigan <p> We are tourists . <p> I have recently come to terms with this . My husband and I were never the kind who traveled to expand our minds . We traveled to have fun  --  Weeki Wachee , Gatlinburg , South of the Border , Lake George , Rock City , Wall Drug . We have seen swimming pigs and horses , a Russian palace covered with corn , young girls underwater drinking Pepsi-Cola from the seven-ounce bottle , London Bridge in the middle of a desert , a cycling cockatoo riding a tightrope . <p> I guess we always knew . <p> This , our last trip , was appropriately planned at the last minute , the luxury of the retiree . It is one that I 'm glad I decided we take , although everybody ( doctors , children ) forbade us to go . " I strongly , strongly advise against any type of travel , Ella , " said Dr. Tomaszewski , one of the seemingly hundreds of physicians currently attending to me , when I hinted that my husband and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of even a weekend getaway to my daughter , she used a tone that one would normally reserve for a disobedient puppy . ( " No ! " ) <p> But John and I needed a vacation , more than we 've ever needed one before . Besides , the doctors only want me to stay around so they can run their tests on me , poke me with their icy instruments , spot shadows inside of me . They 've already done plenty of that . And while the children are only concerned with our well-being , it 's still really none of their business . Durable power of attorney does n't mean you get to run the whole show . <p> You yourself might ask : Is this the best idea ? Two down-on-their-luck geezers , one with more health problems than a third world country , the other so senile that he does n't even know what day it is  --  taking a cross-country road trip ? Do n't be stupid . Of course it 's not a good idea . <p> There 's a story about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a young girl , decided when he got to his seventies that he would simply shove off to Mexico . He wrote , " Naturally , it is possible , even probable , that I shall not return . These being strange countries , in which things happen . " He also wrote : " It beats old age , disease , or falling down the cellar stairs . " Speaking as someone who is acquainted with all three of those , I heartily agree with old Ambrose . <p> Put simply , we had nothing to lose . So I decided to take action . Our little Leisure Seeker camper van was packed and ready . We have kept it that way ever since retirement . So after assuring my children that a vacation was indeed out of the question , I kidnapped my husband , John , and we stole off , headed for Disneyland . That 's where we took the kids , so we like it better than the other one . After all , at this point in our lives , we are more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit area , where we 've lived all our lives , we make our way west across the state . It 's a lovely trip so far , peaceful and steady . The air stream at my vent window creates a satin whoosh of white noise as the miles tug us from our old selves . Minds clear , aches diminish , worries evaporate , at least for a few hours . John does n't speak at all but seems very content to drive . He 's having one of his quiet days . <p> After about three hours , we stop for our first night in a small resort town that fancies itself an " artists ' colony . " As you enter the town proper , you pass , shrouded among the evergreens , a painter 's palette the size of a children 's wading pool , each daub of paint neatly dotted with a colored electric bulb that illuminates its corresponding hue . Next to it , a sign : <p> Saugatuck <p> This is where we spent our honeymoon almost sixty years ago ( Mrs. Miller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode the Greyhound bus . That was our honeymoon : taking the dog to western Michigan . It was all we could afford , but it was exciting enough for us . ( Ah , the advantages of being easily amused . ) <p> After checking in at the trailer court , we two walk around town a bit , as much as I 'm able , to enjoy what 's left of the afternoon . I 'm very pleased to be here again with my husband so many years later . It 's been at least thirty years since we last visited . I 'm surprised to find the town has not changed much  --  lots of confectioners , art galleries , ice cream parlors , and old-time shops . The park is where I remember it . Many of the early buildings are still standing and in good shape . I 'm surprised that the town 's fathers did n't feel the need to tear everything down and make it new . They must understand that when people are on vacation , they just want to return to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's theirs , even if just for a short time . <p> John and I sit on a bench on Main Street where the autumn air is heavy with the scent of warm fudge . We watch families pass by , wearing shorts and sweatshirts , eating ice cream cones , chattering away , their laughter low-pitched and lackadaisical , the unwound voices of people on vacation . <p> " This is nice , " says John , his first words since we got here . " Is this home ? " " No , but it is nice , " I say . <p> John is always asking if somewhere is home . Especially in the last year or so , when things started getting worse . The memory problems started about four years back , though there were signs of it earlier . It 's been a gradual process with him . ( My problems arose much more recently . ) I 've been told that we 're lucky , yet it does n't feel that way . With his mind , first the corners of the blackboard were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of edges , creating a circle that grew smaller and smaller , before finally disappearing into itself . What is left are only smudges of recollection here and there , places where the eraser did not completely do its job , reminiscences that I hear again and again . Every once in a while , he knows enough to realize that he has forgotten much of our life together , but these moments happen less and less these days . It cheers me on the rare occasion when he is angered by his forgetfulness because it means he 's still on this side , here with me . Most of the time , he 's not . It 's all right . I am the keeper of the memories . <p> <br> Continues ...
