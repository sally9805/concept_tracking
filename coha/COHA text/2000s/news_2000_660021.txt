<p> It 's noontime at Obongo , a fast-paced Internet start-up in Redwood City , Calif. , and the line for the lunch buffet already stretches around the corner of the lunchroom . But the spread on the counter is n't limited to the typical dotcom fare of pizza and deli sandwiches . Instead , plates are piled high with exotic dishes - from batata wadas to biriyani to banitza . Here at Obongo , workplace diversity is demonstrated , not declared . There are no " celebrate diversity " posters and no affinity groups . Yet among the 85 employees at Obongo , more than 20 different ethnic backgrounds are represented at all levels of the company . Roughly 40 percent of Obongo 's workforce is female . " There 's no glass ceiling here , " says Soraya Bittencourt , vice president of engineering , who previously worked at Microsoft , where she created the company 's popular Expedia software . " If you 're good , you 're good . " While this degree of employee diversity is far from widespread in the American workplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and the growth potential for companies willing to tap into a much broader employment pool . Does the formula work ? The year-old , privately held Obongo declines to trumpet its earnings . But amid widespread flight by venture capitalists away from dotcoms , Obongo 's recently been at the receiving end of $ 25 million . The company 's location puts it at the forefront of a new demographic trend . According to Census Bureau estimates , whites are no longer the majority group in California , which , at 33 million people is the most populous state in the union . Taken together , the state 's various ethnic minorities now constitute a new majority . Obongo 's workplace diversity also reflects the growing realization that doing business in today 's economy can be easier for a company that 's multiculturally staffed . " Companies that are serious about competing in a global economy understand that a diverse workforce will add the fresh perspective and creative thinking that will appeal to an increasingly diverse marketplace , " says Preston Edwards Sr. , CEO and chairman of iMinorities Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site for minorities and women . Cap Gemini Ernst &; Young ( CGE &Y),; an international consulting firm , has a comprehensive diversity program for its 57,000 employees . It releases , for example , a monthly planning calendar to help managers schedule meetings on days that do not conflict with various religious holidays or ethnic/national celebrations . The program has helped the company to retain and recruit minorities and women . " We find that the diversity of thought that comes from the diversity of employees leads to a better product for our clients , " says Beth McCarty , director of the CGE &Y's; Office for Diversity in Chicago . The Silicon Valley model While CGE &Y; has been involved in the move toward the creation of more inclusive and multicultural workplaces for much of the past decade , newer workplaces like Obongo 's , says Ms. McCarty , are worth studying . " Silicon Valley has been a leader , and we watch what they do because we recruit many of the same people ... We 're always looking to find a better way to do business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most talent and potential to produce and support the company 's unique product - a Web " toolbar " that allows users to simplify log-in , password , and form-filling tasks at any Web site . While the toolbar can be downloaded for free , Obongo generates most of its revenue by co-branding and customizing it for high-profile corporations . Founded in September 1999 , the privately held company already has small field offices in New York , London , Munich , and Bombay . Co-founders John Hunt and Jai Rawat say that as central as workplace diversity may be to their success , they pointedly chose not to formalize an affirmative-action hiring plan . Mr. Hunt , the British-born Irishman who serves as the company 's CEO and Mr. Rawat , an Indian-born technological wizard who is Obongo 's chief technology officer , say their multicultural workplace is simply a logical outgrowth of the company 's search for adept and well-versed employees . " It 's one of our greatest strengths that we can have this diversity and therefore all these divergent ideas , " enthuses Toks Olushola , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and is of Nigerian heritage . Some still left behind But the absence of an affirmative-action policy in hiring also means that Obongo 's relatively small workforce does not have a high percentage of employees from the groups most underrepresented in IT , relative to their population : African-Americans and Latinos . " There are many social roots to the lack of representation of people of color in IT , " says Oliver Chin , director of marketing and acquisitions . " Companies in general need to place it as a higher priority to improve their representation of certain groups . " Several employees of Obongo are brought in under H-1B visas , which are allotted for highly skilled foreign workers . Last month , President Clinton signed into law a measure increasing the annual cap on these visas from 115,000 to 195,000 workers . The measure also sets up a $ 1,000 visa application fee that will fund programs to retrain 150,000 US workers for technology jobs . Hunt says he is aware of concern among some labor groups and minority organizations that H-1B visas are a substitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's also important to remember that these imported workers have been - and continue to be - an integral part of the success of American IT companies . " We 're not paying lip service to some politically correct mantra , " he insists . " We see daily how the exchange of culture and education generates wonderful results . " ' Positive friction ' Sonia Wong joined Obongo as a business development manager in October 1999 . By March she had been promoted to director of product management . Ms. Wong 's new role means sometimes arguing with the top boss . " There 's not too many places where you can openly challenge the CEO , but I do , " she says . Hunt views such disagreements as the greatest asset of multiculturalism - something he calls " positive friction . " Creative competition is encouraged at many firms . But Hunt says a deep mix of backgrounds like the one at Obongo adds a spark . " We argue a lot , " he boasts . " I believe that creativity and innovation flourish where cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to support that argument . " In particular , Hunt says he takes inspiration from the world 's coastal societies , which have produced great accomplishments out of the inevitable exchange of commerce and culture . While conversations are lively at Obongo , not all are free of miscommunication . The everyday challenge of a multicultural workforce , says Rawat , is learning how to better understand the cultural context that shapes the way in which people behave . In certain cultures , he explains , " people are not as open about their feelings and emotions . " At some meetings , says Ms. Bittencourt , subordinates were not asking important questions when managers were present . Those employees , she says , grew up in cultures which expressly discouraged the public questioning of people in power . After the meeting , they would scramble to get clarification from their peers instead . To remedy the situation , Obongo created a " front-line-managers group , " so that each department could appoint a peer to serve in an intermediary management capacity . Employees who would otherwise feel hesitant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these front-line managers , says Bittencourt , who is of Brazilian descent . Another strategy Bittencourt 's engineering department has implemented to address the special demands of its workers : an informal policy allowing generous vacation leaves so that people can visit relatives in far-away countries . " Companies that have a more diverse workforce have policies in place that foster a good work environment . That kind of environment is not only good for minorities , it 's good for everybody , whites included , " says Mr. Edwards of iMinorities Inc . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 .
