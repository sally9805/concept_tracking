<p> In a city where police often must convince residents they are not the enemy , Vallejo K-9 Officer Jeff Azuar was considered a friend by many . In schools , in neighborhoods and in his own department , he embodied the positive , caring side of law enforcement . <p> So when he was felled by a single bullet while serving a warrant in April , the city moved quickly to explain his death . Police said the suspect , Joseph Teitgen , was a drug addict pumped up on methamphetamines when he shot Azuar , 50 , at close range with a .357 Magnum during a frantic struggle with officers . <p> Officials said Teitgen had no prior contacts with the department and was picked up on a 4-month-old warrant from Napa County as a matter of routine police business . <p> But information is emerging that shows possible police misconduct may have helped turn a down-and-out carpet-layer with no history of violent crime into an accused cop killer . <p> Teitgen 's arrest was set in motion not by law enforcement but by an auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Teitgen and allegedly owned the gun used to kill Azuar . <p> And Azuar was in the dark about what at least one of his fellow officers knew : Teitgen , 34 , was an informant and a drug addict , known to carry weapons and afraid of a police setup or worse . <p> " The real tragedy here is that this was an avoidable incident and it resulted in a tragic death , " said Stephen Krimel , an attorney representing Teitgen . " There was a trained professional who dropped the ball , and the result was a fatality to a brother officer . " <p> Vallejo police spokeswoman Lt. JoAnn West has declined to talk about the case , citing a pending internal investigation . Likewise , prosecutor George Williamson has remained silent about allegations of police misconduct . <p> According to interviews and documents obtained by The Chronicle , Teitgen was running scared from at least one narcotics officer who has been the subject of an internal affairs investigation for his handling of Teitgen . <p> The officer , Kevin Hamrick , knew in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binging on methamphetamines and might be armed . But Hamrick apparently never told Azuar and the two other officers who arrived at Teitgen 's home to arrest him . <p> Azuar also did not know that Teitgen had helped set up a narcotics sting in Napa County in a deal facilitated by Hamrick that might have helped Teitgen avoid jail time for a grand-theft conviction . <p> In fact , Azuar and Officer Douglas Wilcox never even drew their guns before they found Teitgen hiding in the garage of the Tennessee Street home from which he was being evicted . Less than a minute later , Azuar was dying from a gunshot wound to the head after a fierce fight in a short , narrow stairwell . <p> Police reports show that Teitgen was introduced to Hamrick  --  a narcotics officer  --  last year by a man named Darroll Widmann . Widmann has owned a variety of auto shops in Vallejo and is friendly with many Vallejo officers , including Azuar , with whom , as he told detectives , he was planning to take a trip to Reno . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a tow-truck driver , according to a statement Widmann gave Vallejo police the day after Azuar was shot . <p> INITIAL OFFER <p> According to a report from Napa County drug officers , Teitgen contacted Hamrick in January and offered to be an informant if it would help out in Napa County , where he failed to surrender last December to serve 90 days in jail on a check fraud conviction . <p> Teitgen was signed up as an informant on February 3 , documents show . Police pulled the warrant out of the system and Teitgen was ordered to appear the following month in court where he could ask to serve his sentence in a jail work-release program or on electronic home detention . <p> In the meantime , Teitgen had arranged a buy with a methamphetamine supplier as part of a Napa police sting . But he was concerned that an undercover officer had blown his cover during the meeting , according to sources close to the case . <p> But it was the only deal Teitgen was able or willing to be involved in , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in court on March 6 , the warrant was reissued and he was deactivated as an informant by Napa drug officers three weeks later . <p> Teitgen found out that he was again wanted in Napa County when he received a notice to appear in court , and he blamed Hamrick and Widmann , sources said . <p> Hamrick has been the subject of a police internal affairs investigation , according to court documents . He declined to comment for this article when contacted last week by The Chronicle . Widmann , when asked for his comment , said , " I 've got nothing to say . " <p> Teitgen , according to his friends and family , was also being " squeezed " by Hamrick and Widmann and allegedly had paid them in cash and a vehicle to make his problems in Napa go away . <p> " They had promised him if he would lead them to somebody , then they would clear his name , " said Teitgen 's mother , Donna Lisle , whose father was a Vallejo police officer . " He refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening him and threatening his children . " <p> SUSPECT BECOMES PARANOID <p> Lisle said her son became so paranoid that he shaved his head and stayed at a motel to hide out . <p> About a month before Azuar was shot , Hamrick and Widmann were driving together to a fast-food restaurant when they saw Teitgen driving with his 3-year-old daughter . Teitgen spotted the pair and raced home at 90 mph , with Hamrick and Widmann in pursuit . <p> According to Widmann 's statement to police , Hamrick followed Teitgen inside the house and talked with him while Widmann stayed outside . <p> But that statement is contradicted by the contents of a tape recorder Teitgen was wearing on his ankle during the encounter . Sources , including Teitgen 's wife , say they have heard the tape , which reportedly shows that both men followed Teitgen into the house . Hamrick allegedly told Teitgen never to run from him . Widmann reportedly threatened to kill him . <p> " They still wanted more from him , " said Jackie Teitgen . " He threatened to go above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to do ? ' " <p> RECORDER DISCOVERED <p> The same recorder was found by police in the stairwell where Azuar was shot , according to a crime scene report . It was turned over to investigators , but according to a police report , the device did not capture any sounds of the struggle between Teitgen and the officers . <p> Out-of-county warrants for nonviolent crimes are typically a low priority for law enforcement . But the warrant for Teitgen apparently became a high priority for Vallejo police when Teitgen became a problem for Widmann . <p> According to a police report , Teitgen in early April was not sleeping for days at a time as he continued a drug binge , was " out in left field " and began threatening Widmann . Widmann said he told Hamrick that " something needed to be done " about him . <p> On April 12 , Hamrick got a call from Widmann , who , according to his police interview , was afraid Teitgen was going to come after him and wanted him picked up on the reinstated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of town that day and suggested Widmann call another officer , Daniel Reid , to handle the problem . And although Reid was off duty , he considered Widmann 's request important enough to contact Wilcox and ask him to arrest Teitgen . <p> But Wilcox apparently knew little or nothing of Teitgen 's background . At a preliminary hearing earlier this month , Wilcox testified that he had put out a call for backup over his radio . Azuar and Sgt. Larry Rogers answered the call , and the three officers met briefly around the corner from Teitgen 's house  --  Azuar confirming the warrant 's validity over the radio  --  before attempting to start the arrest . <p> OFFICERS UNAWARE <p> The officers clearly were not expecting to confront an armed and dangerous suspect . After all , the warrant for Teitgen stemmed from a nonviolent theft crime . <p> But according to Widmann 's statements to detectives , Teitgen had carried a .22-caliber revolver that Widmann passed along to Hamrick for destruction . Widmann told police he knew  --  and presumably Hamrick knew  --  that Teitgen carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to inform other officers about their client and Hamrick 's decision to allow an arrest to proceed without being present amount to deadly negligence at the least . <p> " I would n't expect that kind of mishandling of information and mishandling of that situation from a brand-new rookie cop , " Krimel said of Hamrick 's supervision of Teitgen . " This does n't constitute an excuse for what Joe did that day . But there is a tremendous amount of evidence in the case of extreme paranoia by Joe Teitgen . It was extreme paranoia that Kevin Hamrick was aware of and Darroll complained about it . Sending Jeff and Wilcox in there that day without a heads up ' was an invitation to disaster . " <p> Well-aware of the emotions that Azuar 's death has sparked in Solano County , Teitgen 's attorneys are seeking to prevent any county judge from hearing the case . Eight judges attended Azuar 's funeral , including Judge Mike Nail , who earlier this month refused to delay a preliminary hearing after Teitgen 's attorneys said they were not ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky-high on drugs , Teitgen was stronger and faster than the officers who came to arrest him . They found him hiding in the garage , but he was able to run between Wilcox and Azuar in a dash for the stairs . Wilcox managed to grab Teitgen , and the suspect dragged the officer almost to the top of the stairway . <p> As Wilcox wrestled with Teitgen , Azuar was pressing close behind , trying to help hold the suspect down . Teitgen pulled out his gun and according to his lawyers was trying to shoot himself when the .357 fired three times , the last shot likely striking Azuar as Teitgen broke free of Wilcox . <p> " ( Azuar ) came to an upright position and fell away , " Wilcox said while recalling the shooting at a court hearing earlier this month . Azuar landed in a bloody heap at the bottom of the stairs , his gun and radio next to him . <p> Teitgen was trying to escape through a second-story window when Rogers shot him in the chest . Incredibly , Rogers testified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent Teitgen from using it . The two men wrestled over Teitgen 's gun , and Rogers said Teitgen was trying to raise the weapon to shoot the officer when backup units arrived and overpowered him . <p> An ambulance had already taken Azuar to Sutter Solano Hospital , where he was pronounced dead when Detective Ron Becker leaned over the wounded Teitgen and prepared to record a statement from the suspect . <p> The first words Teitgen uttered were " Kevin , Kevin , " according to a transcript . At one point , Becker asked , " Why did you shoot the officer ? " <p> " Cause of Kevin ( Hamrick ) . Darryl ( sic ) . . . " Teitgen said . <p> " Why did you shoot him ? " Becker said again . <p> " I wanted to die , ' cause Kevin come ( tape inaudible ) they f  --  me , man , " Teitgen said , explaining shortly before he was loaded into the helicopter , " I did n't mean to . " <p> Teitgen told Becker that Widmann had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the transcript . <p> Jackie Teitgen disputes much of what police have said publicly about Azuar 's death . She claims the officers did draw their guns when they came to arrest her husband . And she denies that Teitgen ever threatened Widmann . <p> " He was always afraid of Darroll , " Jackie Teitgen said . " He never had enough courage to threaten Darroll. "
