Chapter One Portuguese Cantonment Goa , India 1657 Satisfied that her face looked perfect , Lucinda Teresa Emilia Dasana dipped a pheasant 's tail feather into a crystal vial and touched a milky drop of belladonna to the corner of each eye . " Aya , " she said , dabbing at a tear before it stained her powdered cheek , " I ca n't find my arsnico . " Across the room , her maid folded Lucinda 's dressing gown . " It 's all gone , my beb . I meant to tell you . " Lucinda , blinking as the belladonna blurred her eyes , bit her bottom lip in frustration . Then she smiled patiently at her maid , not knowing that one of her front teeth was speckled with vermilion . " Aya , the box was right here . Where have you hidden it ? " The maid , Helene , as if unaware that Lucinda could not see , shook her head and kept on folding . " You should not be using that terrible paste , little one . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . " " I 'm not your little one anymore . I 'm a woman . A lady . And you are my maid now , no longer my nurse . So bring me my arsnico , " Lucinda said . Helene , whose name before she became a Christian had been Ambalika , muttered something in Hindi . " I am not a bitch in heat , " Lucinda whisperedangrily . " And I have said , we will speak only Portuguese . Now bring it . " Helene looked suddenly very old . Lucinda , her eyes blurred by belladonna , did not see this change , but she heard Helene 's weary sigh . Lucinda 's heart ached , but she remembered herself , and her new station in the world , and said nothing . Helene , meanwhile , reached beneath the feather mattress and brought out a tiny silver box . " Do n't use too much , please , " Helene said in Portuguese . " I 'll use what I want , " Lucinda answered , and took such a large pinch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect she wanted , however , Lucinda only touched a little to her tongue . " There . " " You should n't take this poison . If your mother were here ! That red stuff only will make you sick and you are so beautiful without it . " " You only say that because you love me . I need it -- -I must not be seen with dark skin . " " What 's wrong with dark skin ? " Lucinda lowered her eyes , regretting her words , for of course Helene was dark as shadow . " I 'm sorry , dear one , " Lucinda said in Hindi , and though she could not see it , Helene smiled . " You know my cousin has just come from Macao . I have n't seen him in years , " she went on in Portuguese . " I must look my best . It 's fashionable to be pale . All the Lisbon ladies use arsnico these days . " Helene snorted . " So they are pale , yes . But they are not pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cousin ? What would your mother say , our lady rest her soul ? You are pledged ! If your father were alive . . . " But Lucinda had stopped paying attention . Through the window that looked to the sea , a salt breeze carried the sounds of Goa : the cries of street merchants in Hindi and Portuguese , the blare of gongs and drums from a nearby Shiva temple , and on top of all , the golden cathedral bell of Santa Catarina , tolling the hour . The breeze whispered through Lucinda 's upswept hair . She swirled a stiff silk shawl over her shoulders . " How do I look ? " Too young , thought Helene . Too young to wear a corset laced so tight , or a bodice cut so low . Oh , what will people think ? The pupils of Lucinda 's eyes , now huge from belladonna , glistened : dark , inviting , like hidden pools lit by moonlight . " I suppose you look all right , " Helene said at last . But Lucinda had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already reached the stairs to her uncle 's office . Until her father 's death the year before , the halls had glowed , bathed in lamplight . But the arrival of Uncle Carlos changed all that . He hated waste ; he would stamp through the halls , snuffing out candles with his fingertips . " Thrift ! " he 'd shout to anyone in earshot . " Economy ! " But in the dimness , Lucinda 's deliciously dilated eyes could see perfectly . Still she edged forward with one hand pressed against the wood-paneled walls , for the arsnico was making her feel light-headed . Carlos Dasana glared across his table , awash with papers , and wagged a heavy finger at his nephew . " Do n't you realize the trouble you are in ? " Geraldo Silveira shifted in the hard wooden seat -- -perhaps to adjust his coat , perhaps to hide the amusement in his eyes . His long fingers played with the lace cuffs of his shirt . " I apolgize , Tio Carlos . . . " " Do n't insult me with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't apologize for murder ! Dueling in the streets ! They hang men for this ! " Carlos pounded on the heavy wooden table so hard that a pile of papers bounced into the air . " And the husband you killed was your own cousin ! " " I only found that out after , Tio . I apolog . . . " " For the love of God , hold your tongue ! If it had not been for me , Aldo , you 'd be locked in the stocks , getting your feet roasted . And then to Lisbon and the gallows , that 's what . You owe me a debt ! " Carlos drummed his fingers on the dark wood table and considered his nephew . " You 're too handsome . You 've been spoiled . All mothers spoil their children , but my sister went too far , rest her soul . And your useless father . . . " " He was a good man , Tio . " Geraldo 's eyes flashed , but he kept his voice calm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask your opinion ? I 'll blame who I wish ! Your father was a rounder and a fool . Like you , too handsome for his own good . Learn from his mistakes , Aldo . " The older man stopped glaring at his nephew and tugged his mustache . " But I blame myself as well . I have indulged you too much . I should have . . . " Carlos Dasana stopped short , rubbed his brow with his heavy fingers , and sighed . " You ca n't live like you have no future , Aldo ! Keep your fonte in your pants . You ca n't bed every woman you see just because you get a tingle . Not if they 're married , for the love of the virgin ! Those you keep your hands off ! Otherwise people end up dead ! " " With luck , only the husband , Tio . " Carlos Dasana 's eyes bulged , and a vein began to pulse across his forehead . Geraldo leaned forward , worried that he might have a fit , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , eh ? " He struggled to frown . " Why not take a bayadere , for the love of the Virgin ? They 're cheap enough and better than any wife , eh ? " Geraldo leaned back and looked straight into the older man 's eyes . " Where 's the sport , Uncle ? " His sharp face slowly opened into a sly grin . Ah , he 's a Dasana , all right , his uncle thought . " Look here , Aldo , I 've intervened on your behalf . You 've been placed in my custody . Sent to Goa instead of to the gallows . " Geraldo lowered his head . " Tio Carlos , I wish to thank you . . . " Carlos snorted . " Do n't . Before you 're done , you might wish for the gallows ! To be frank , you could n't have come to Goa at a worse time . " He leaned back in his chair . " After twenty years of combat , the Pepper Wars are over , Aldo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be serious . Surely the Portuguse fleet . . . " The old man sputtered . " The fleet ? Have you looked in the harbor ? Do you see a fleet anywhere ? They 're gone ! Gone to Brazil ! We 've handed all Asia to the Dutch , but now , now we do must everything to save precious Brazil ! Face facts , Aldo ! Lisbon has abandoned us ! Goa is lost ! The Dutch have strangled us . Only a few dhows will even try to run that blockade . " Carlos Dasana shook his head . " Our countrymen flee like rats . They take what they can carry and run , the cowards . Only a few hundred Portuguese remain in Goa . Even the goddammed priests have gone , most of them . " Dasana hesitated , as if his next thoughts were too painful to voice . Geraldo seemed to sense this . He leaned across the table . " Come , Tio . I am not a child to be toyed with , nor did you bring me here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carlos blinked and bit his lip . " You 're right . I need someone I can trust . Someone of my blood . The Pepper Wars have wiped us out . The Dasanas are near ruin . " It took a moment before Geraldo could reply . " I do n't believe it ! " " My brother , rest his soul , made a mess of things . I do n't know if I can repair them . We 're out of cash . We have goods , Lord yes ! Factors full of goods . But the Dutch have us by the balls . We ca n't trade , Aldo , and without trade we 're dying . " Dasana leaned close to his nephew , his voice now a harsh whisper . " How much do you know about the country of Bijapur ? " " Those Muslim devils ? Only that they have been our enemies for a hundred years . First those infidels surrendered Goa to us , and then they attacked us ! They massacred our colonists , and they slaughtered our women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's in the past . Forgive and forget . " " Tio Carlos ! " " Enemies are a luxury for the rich , Aldo . We 're broke . We 'll take all the friends we can buy . Now , listen , Aldo , listen well . We have one chance to change things . " Carlos glanced around the room , as though spies might be anywhere . " The sultan of Bijapur died about a year ago . His heir 's only nine years old . Bijapur 's gone mad . The widow queen , the sultana , has come out of the harem to try to rule . It 's unheard of . . . a complete disasater . So now the sultana has agreed to appoint a regent , and there lies all our hope . " The older man arranged himself in his chair . " This is why I have brought you here . I have a job for you , Aldo . " Geraldo sat up straight , eyes hooded and watchful . Carlos noted this , and continued : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes regent , he 'll give us a trade monopoly in Bijapur for eight years . " " Our man ? Who is our man ? " " Wali Khan , the grand vizier of Bijapur . " Carlos bit his lip . " He should get the regency . He should -- -but it wo n't be easy . He 's got the sultana to contend with , and she 's a handful . And then there 's the army -- -armies are always a problem -- -but this is even worse because the commander 's a Hindu , and Hindus are unpredictable . Worst of all : eunuchs . The Khasjwara is a eunuch . He 'll have all his brothers plotting for him . Even so , despite it all , Wali Khan will win . He should win . He must . " " What have you done to persuade him , Tio Carlos ? How have you brought him to our side ? " " Do you think it was easy ? Baksheesh . Bribing . There is no other way . . . . Wali Khan is too powerful to threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great one . The man has refined tastes . The bribe must inspire him , not insult him . " Carlos allowed himself a small smile . " We 've managed to procure a certain item for him -- -something unique . Something he covets . Aye , something he covets more than life . A half a lakh of hun we paid -- -that 's equivalent to forty thousand rials , " Geraldo 's eyes grew wide . " Our bribe comes all the way from Orissa , Aldo -- -that 's the length we 've gone to get it -- -and arrives by dhow today if the wind is right . Then off to Bijapur within the week . I want you to go with the caravan . We 've hired the best settlement man in Hindustan -- -a fellow named Da Gama . You may have met him , he 's a distant relation . " Geraldo shook his head . " Well , Da Gama 's the best : he 's honest , he 's dull , he has no imagination or ambition , but he 's deadly and ready for violence . " " He sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldo -- -I 'm relying on you ! I need you to keep your eyes open . " Geraldo lowered his head so Carlos could not see his smile . " I shall study him , Tio . " Carlos gave his nephew a withering look , as if doubting that Geraldo had ever studied in his life . He sighed . " I 'm going to have to shut down this house . For a while , at least . We 'll lose face , of course , but it ca n't be helped . " " You 're returning to Lisbon ? " " Not to Lisbon . To Bijapur . Like it or not , the fates of the Dasanas are intertwined with our old enemies . " Carlos looked into his nephew 's eyes with unexpected frankness . " I do n't know how I 'm going to tell Lucinda . She 's lost her mother , her father -- -now to lose her home . . . " " But is n't Lucinda pledged to be married ? " " That 's off ! " Carlos barked . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carlos 's voice broke off suddenly . Geraldo thought he was choking . " I love that sweet girl , " Carlos mumbled . He tugged a dark kerchief from his sleeve , wiped his eyes , and gave his nose a shaking blow . " You must not say anything to her , Aldo . Not a word about the bastard dropping the engagement . I 'll tell her when the time is right . And nothing about moving to Bijapur , either ! She 'd rather die than leave Goa . " Carlos examined the kerchief and then wiped his eyes . " Keep your mouth shut around her , do you hear ? She 's fragile . She 's become as a daughter to me . " Again Carlos blew his nose , but this time , to Geraldo 's relief , he stuffed his kerchief away without a glance . " Well , it 's business . It ca n't be helped . In the meantime , you 'll accompany the bribe to Wali Khan . You and the settlement man . That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my trust . Succeed and you 'll have my gratitude . Fail , and I 'll send you to Lisbon and the gallows . Do we understand each other ? " Geraldo nodded . " Very well . I 'll say no more . You 're my sister 's only son . Who else can I trust ? We need that monopoly . . . and the bribe is the key ! Our only hope is getting her to Wali Khan . She 's worth a fortune , so keep your eyes open ! Tell Wali Khan that if he becomes regent , then she 's all his . " Geraldo 's brow furrowed . " She ? Do you mean a ship , Uncle ? " " Not a ship -- -what gave you that idea ? I mean the bribe ! She 's a bayadere , boy . . . a nautch girl , the finest whore that 's ever been ! " The door opened and as a wave crashes on the shore , Lucinda burst in , her white dress an explosion of brightness in Tio Carlos 's dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she floated across the carpet on silk-slippered feet . At the door , a sheepish-looking secretary lifted his hands hopelessly and Carlos shook his head and waved the man away . They had as much hope of stopping a cyclone as Lucinda . " Uncle , dearest ! " Lucinda sang , swirling toward the table . The old man rose and placed a respectable kiss on his niece 's proffered cheek . " And this must be Geraldo ! " " Yes , I 've just come from Macao , " said Geraldo , standing . " This is your cousin , Lucinda Dasana , " Carlos said formally . His brow furrowed at seeing them together . Geraldo swept into a bow . Lucinda returned a long courtesy , but though she lowered her head , her eyes stayed fixed on her cousin 's face . Her vision was still blurred by the belladonna , but in the dark room she noted that he was tall , that his shoulders were wide and his hips narrow , that his face was tanned but his eyes sparkled , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should never have known you , " Geraldo said , his gaze roaming over her . " You were six when last we met . I put a toad down your dress , if I remember right . " His eyes gleamed when he said this and she blushed . " I 'm sure you never did , or I 'd remember and hate you . Anyway I 'm grown now . " Lucinda laughed , turning so the pale light of the office 's single window caught her face . " Remember , she 's pledged , " Carlos said pointedly , " so do n't get any ideas . " " Uncle ! " cried Lucinda . " We 're cousins . " Geraldo seemed to have thought about the question . " Technically , he 's right -- -we are cousins , but many , many times removed . We might even marry if we wished . " His dark eyes peered deep into Lucinda 's . " I said she 's pledged , " Carlos said firmly . " Remember what I told you ! " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes danced so when he asked that , his question seemed impertinent . Lucinda turned away again , her face burning . " Marques Oliveira , a former minister to his majesty , " Carlos answered for her , a hint of warning in his voice . " A great man . " " I hope he is handsome , " Geraldo said . " A woman like you deserves a handsome husband . " " His portrait is handsome , " Lucinda stammered . " We have n't actually met . " Carlos did n't like the turn of this talk . " Of course he 's handsome ! He 's rich , is n't he ? " " My very best wishes , " Geraldo said . But this time when he bowed he fastened his eyes on her , and this time , through her misty eyes , she looked back . As he swept upward Aldo grasped her hand like a tiny bird in his long fingers and gently brushed it with his lips . " Let us be good friends , cousin , now that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mustache tickling her knuckles . " I 'm about to go to Bijapur . Would you like to come along ? " Carlos sputtered as he leaned over his desk . " What are you saying , Aldo ? I never . . . " But Lucinda had already heard , and when she turned to Tio Carlos , her face pale with arsnico and her eyes limpid with belladonna , beseeching him , it was more than any uncle could resist , even an uncle as strong-willed as Carlos Dasana . " Please , Uncle , please . You promised I could visit Tio Victorio ! " It was a good idea , Carlos had to admit : sending her to Bijapur now would make it simpler to close down the house . But he disliked any idea he had not thought up himself . So of course Carlos said no at once . Then no again , and then once more , no . The trip would not be easy , Carlos warned . And Bijapur was not like Goa . Victorio , her uncle who managed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill . These objections merely fired Lucinda 's resolve . One by one Geraldo countered them , and each time Lucinda would beg again , each time more plaintively than before . " Very well , little one . You may go . But you 'll do what you 're told , yes ? And follow orders for a change ? " " Oh yes , Tio Carlos , " Lucinda answered , tiptoeing to kiss his rough brown cheek . Then the arsnico , or her corset , or the excitement seemed to overwhelm her , and her pale face grew even paler , and her eyes fluttered , and she fainted into her uncle 's arms . My God , thought Carlos as he caught her , she looks pale as death . By the Blessed Virgin , he thought as her breasts heaved , and her dark curls spilled across his arms . She 's a grown woman . You truly are a Dasana , my dear niece , he thought ; and the Dasana women are as dangerous as gold . He glanced at his nephew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arms . What have I agreed to ? Carlos thought . May the Blessed Virgin save us from our relatives . The shallow-keeled dhow scudded over the gray seas , clinging to the rock-edged shore . The captain 's eyes were everywhere : to the dark and threatening sky and the twisting monsoon winds , then on the steersman beside him , pressed hard against the shuddering rudder , to the triangle sail that furled and luffed as his sailors heaved the boom , and again and yet again upon the thirty-gun privateer at the harbor mouth , its tricolor flag bright against the black clouds . Would she follow ? Would she fire ? As the dhow swung into the harbor and the waves of the Arabian Sea tried to hammer it against the moss-furred rocks of Arguin , the captain peered at the warship . If she was turning to fire , there was little he could do . The Goans would n't help him -- -they had no ships to fight her . Continues ...              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
