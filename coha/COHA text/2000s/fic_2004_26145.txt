Chapter One COLONEL GEOFFREY SHAFER loved his new life in Salvador , Brazil 's third-largest city and some would say its most intriguing . It was definitely the most fun . He had rented a plush six-bedroom villa directly across from Guarajuba Beach , where he spent his days drinking sweet caipirinhas and ice-cold Brahma beers , or sometimes playing tennis at the club . At night , Colonel Shafer-the psychopathic killer better known as the Weasel-was up to his old tricks , hunting on the dark , narrow , winding streets of the Old City . He had lost count of his kills in Brazil , and nobody in Salvador seemed to care , or even keep count . There had n't been a single newspaper story about the disappearance of young prostitutes . Not one . Maybe it was true what they said of the people here-when they were n't actually partying , they were already rehearsing for the next one . At a few ticks past two in the morning , Shafer returned to the villa with a young and beautiful streetwalker who called herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a stunning brown body , especially for someone so young . Maria said she was only thirteen . The Weasel picked a fat banana from one of several plants in his yard . At this time of year he had his choice of coconut , guava , mango , and pinha , which was sugar apple . As he plucked the fresh fruit he had the thought that there was always something ripe for the taking in Salvador . It was paradise . Or maybe it 's hell and I 'm the Devil , Shafer thought , and chuckled to himself . " For you , Maria , " he said , handing her the banana . " We 'll put it to good use . " The girl smiled knowingly , and the Weasel noticed her eyes-what perfect brown eyes . And all mine now-eyes , lips , breasts . Just then , he spotted a small Brazilian monkey called a mico trying to work its way through a window screen and into his house . " Get out of here , you thieving little bastard ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a quick movement from out of the bushes , then three men jumped him . The police , he was certain , probably Americans . Alex Cross ? The cops were all over him , powerful arms and legs everywhere . He was struck down by a bat , or a lead pipe , yanked back up by his full head of hair , then beaten unconscious . " We caught him . We caught the Weasel , first try . That was n't very hard , " said one of the men . " Bring him inside . " Then he looked at the beautiful young girl , who was clearly afraid , rightly so . " You did a good job , Maria . You brought him to us . " He turned to one of his men . " Kill her . " A single gunshot ruptured the silence in the front yard . No one seemed to notice or care in Salvador . ( Continues ... )                    @
