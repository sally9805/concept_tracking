It turns out that the old saw about people drinking their troubles away in bad times  --  and boosting bar business  --  is n't true . Liquor sales lately have moved in step with the economy , which explains why so many attendees are driven to drink here at the annual bar-industry trade show in Las Vegas . With business stagnant at nightclubs , taverns , and restaurant and hotel bars , this is an industry thirsty for a new sensation . <P> Next Big Things come and go  --  remember dry beer , " malternative " beverages and low-cal cream liqueurs ?  --  but the industry has very high hopes for one ongoing craze : from chocolate vodka to tequila-and-lime-spiked rum to sour-raspberry schnapps , flavored spirits are multiplying like empty shot glasses on a 21st birthday . Flavored rums rose from 18% of total rum sales in 1998 to 39% last year . Flavored vodkas are similarly flush . Even Martin Friedland of Jenkintown , Pa. , an importer of fine spirits for more than 50 years , wo n't call flavored liquors a fad ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> To be fair , the bar show does n't look like a gathering of the troubled . This may have to do more with the gallons of free liquor being dispensed at dozens of booths than with statistics , like the one from the National Restaurant Association indicating that bar revenues barely kept pace with inflation in 2002 . In part , the sluggishness can be traced to a post-9/11 shift in leisure tastes . After the terrorist attacks , business dropped off at upscale restaurants and clubs . " People would still go out , but not to spend as they did before , " says Michael Harrelson , editor of the trade publication Nightclub &; Bar . <P> For the past decade , through good times and bad , Americans have drunk less but better , boosting superpremium liquors like Grey Goose vodka and Patron tequila , which cost $3 to $4 more a drink in bars than house brands . Profit margins on such brands are higher all the way from distillery to bar , but they barely balance out the industry-wide drop in volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the industry 's cherished 21- to 28-year-old core customers  --  are n't much interested in old-school labels like Dewar 's or Wild Turkey . Catching their eye means selling at bars ; bars in turn influence retailers . That 's why the bar show is a must for firms like White Rock Distilleries of Lewiston , Maine , which flogs such novelties as schnapps in flavors called Poison ( Wild Berry ) and Sting ( Sour Raspberry ) . Because the slogan for the new line is Have You Had Your Shots Today ? , samples are served by statuesque blonds in white-vinyl nurse uniforms and thigh-high stockings . The visual becomes even more apt after a slug of Poison , which tastes almost exactly like paregoric . <P> Classic spirits are represented at the bar show , as is beer . But in the race to tempt the palates of a generation brought up on mocha frappes  --  and maybe even , in some cases , grab the sweet-toothed fake-ID crowd  --  what chance does , say , a fine vodka like the venerable Russian Magadanskaya have against Ciclon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both getting big play at the Bacardi booth ? ( " There 's not another 70-proof coconut rum out there , " says Steven Messer , a Bacardi assistant marketing manager . ) Or against Atomic X 's cloying , vaguely tropical , nonalcoholic energy drink being touted as a bar pick-me-up ?
