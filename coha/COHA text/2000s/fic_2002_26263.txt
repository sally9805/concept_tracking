It blossomed on the set of Hindenburg , last year 's mega-movie blockbuster , which broke all previous earnings records and garnered seven Academy Awards , including Best Picture : a romance that , unlike the relationship of the heroic characters the two stars portrayed on screen , many said would never last . Now two of the hottest stars in Hollywood have delighted fans by making their big-screen romance a reality ... " Yo . " Officer Nick Calabrese stared down at the front page of the New York Post . The Post , man . The freaking thing had made the Post . Even worse , the front page of the Post . " Yo , a little help over here , please ? " Nick glanced at the other papers lining the front of the newsstand . The Daily News had it , too . Newsday . Even USA Today . About the only paper it had n't made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick was certain it would be in there somewhere . The Metro section , probably . Jesus ! " Yo , Calabrese , " snarled Officer Gerard " G " West , as he struggled to place handcuffs on a local junkie who was proving reluctant to come along quietly . " You gon na stand there readin ' the funnies , or are you gon na help me with this guy ? " Nick picked up a copy of the Post and strolled over to his partner , pointing to the picture of the attractive couple on the cover and tilting it so that the struggling captive could see the photo , too . Look at this " he said . " See thisguy ? The one in the tux ? That 's my sister 's boyfriend . Or was . " The junkie peering at the photo did n't seem to notice when G used this momentary distraction to snap his cuffs in place . " Get outta town " the man said . " No , " Nick said . " Really . " Even G , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , " he said , sarcastically . " And my sister 's dating Denzel Washington . C'm on , Nick . I wan na get a hashbrown down at the Ds . You know they stop servin ' em after ten-thirty . " " I am telling you , " Nick said , holding the paper out so that the owner of the newsstand , who 'd been looking on with interest , could see the photo , too . " That is my sister 's boyfriend . Two of ' em were livin ' together up until about a few months ago , and the rat went and married somebody else behind her back . Can you believe that ? " The newsstand owner replied , his Bangladeshi accent so thick that his English was barely understandable , " No , sir , that I can not believe . " " She wrote that movie , you know , " Nick said to the newsstand owner . " My sister did . The one that made them both so famous . " " You are shitting me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I 'm not , " Nick said . " I swear it . Lou wrote it as , you know , a whadduyacallit . A vehicle . For Barry . " " Who is Barry , sir ? " the newsstand owner wanted to know . " This guy . " Nick pointed at the paper . " Bruno di Blase . That 's not his real name . That 's his , you know , stage name . His real name is Barry . Barry Kimmel . He grew up in our neighborhood out on the island . I used to make him eat bugs . " He noticed the disapproving look his partner sent him , and said , with a shrug , " Well , you know . We were kids . " G , still holding onto the junkie , grunted . " Oh , yeah . Barry . I forgot . Tough break for Lou . You do n't stop squirming around , I swear to God  --  " The junkie however , was having a hard time containing his excitement . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your sister really shacked. up with that guy from Hindenburg ? " " Watch it , " Nick growled . " My sister never shacked up with anybody , understand ? " " Well " G said . " Not anymore , anyway . I mean , not now that the guy 's married to  --  " " You watch it , too . " Nick flashed his partner a look of annoyance over the top of the diminutive criminal 's head while he dug into his pocket and extracted some change , which he tried to give to the owner of the newsstand in exchange for the copy of the Post he held beneath one arm . " Oh , no , sir , " the newsstand operator said graciously . " It is on the house . You are keeping our streets safe for law-abiding citizens . " Nick , pleased , slipped the change back into his pocket . " Hey , " he said . " Thanks . " " And please to tell your sister , " the newsstand owner called , " that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did my wife . It was truly a moving triumph of the human spirit . " " Sure thing , " Nick said , as they moved towards the squad car . " Jesus , I still ca n't believe it . Barry eloped on her !

Hindenburg stars Bruno di Blase and Greta Woolston tied the knot , just days after Ms. Woolstons well-publicized split from longtime boyfriend , action-adventure star Jack Townsend . Townsend , who rose to fame during his four-year stint as the moody Dr. Paul Rourke on the hit television medical drama , " STAT , " and later went on to star as renegade detective Pete Logan in the highly popular Copkiller movies , does not appear to have taken news of his ex 's elopement in stride .
