WHY CITE ? // There are three reasons to cite the materials you use : // To give credit to others ' work and ideas , whether you agree with them or not . When you use their words , you must give them credit by using both quotation marks and citations. // To show readers the materials on which you base your analysis , your narrative , or your conclusions . // To guide readers to the materials you have used so they can examine it for themselves . Their interest might be to confirm your work , to challenge it , or simply to explore it further . // Taken together , these citations fully disclose your sources . That 's important for academic integrity in several ways . // First , good citations parcel out credit . Some belongs to you for the original work you did ; you need to take full responsibility for it . Some belongs to others for their words , ideas , data , drawings , or other work . You need to acknowledge it , openly and explicitly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to tell your story , explain your topic , or document your conclusions , you need to say exactly what you used . Take a simple paper about World War I. No one writing today learned about it first hand . What we know , we learned by reading books and articles , by examining original documents and news reports , by listening to oral histories , by reviewing data compiled by military historians , and perhaps by viewing photographs or movies . When we write about the war , then , we should say how we acquired our information . The only exception is " commonly known information , " something that everyone in the field clearly understands and that does not require any substantiation . There 's no need for a footnote to prove Woodrow Wilson was actually president of the United States . But if you referred to his speech declaring war , you would need a proper citation . If you used his words , you 'd need quotation marks , too . // Third , your readers may want to pursue a particular issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources , whether those are books , interviews , archival documents , Web sites , poems , or paintings . That guidance serves several purposes . Skeptical readers may doubt the basis for your work or your conclusions . Others may simply want to double-check them or do more research on the topic . Your citations should point the way . // What citations should not do is prance about , showing off your knowledge without adding to the reader 's . That 's just bragging. // Beyond this question of style ( and good manners ) , there is the basic issue of honesty . Citations should never mislead your readers . There are lots of ways to mislead or misdirect your readers ; accurate citations avoid them . For example , they should not imply you read books or articles when you really did n't . They should not imply you spent days in the archives deciphering original documents when you actually read them in an edited book or , worse , when you " borrowed " the citation from a scholar who did study the originals . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an edited collection . That 's accurate . It 's fine to burrow into the archives and read the original yourself . It 's dishonest , though , to write citations that only pretend you did . // Good citations should reveal your sources , not conceal them . They should honestly show the research you conducted . That means they should give credit where credit is due , disclose the materials on which you base your work , and guide readers to that material so they can explore it further . Citations like these accurately reflect your work and that of others . They show the ground on which you stand . // Chapter Two THE BASICS OF CITATION // Acknowledging your sources is crucial to doing honest academic work . That means citing them properly , using one of several styles . The one you choose depends on your field , your professor 's advice if you are a student , and your own preferences . // There are three major citation styles : // Chicago ( or Turabian ) , used in many fields // MLA , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , education , engineering , and business // Several sciences have also developed their own distinctive styles : // CSE for the biological sciences // AMA for the biomedical sciences , medicine , and nursing // ACS for chemistry // AIP for physics , plus other styles for astrophysics and astronomy // AMS for mathematics and computer sciences // Legal citations are different from any of these . So are anthropology citations. // I will cover each one , providing clear directions and plenty of examples so you wo n't have any trouble writing correct citations . That way , you can concentrate on your paper , not on the type of citation you 're using . I 'll cover each style separately so you can turn directly to the one you need . Using this information , you 'll be able to cite books , articles , Web sites , films , musical performances , government documents-whatever you use in your papers . // Why would you ever want to use different citation styles ? Why ca n't you just pick one and stick with it ? Because different fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet their special needs , whether it 's genetics or German , and you 'll just have to use them . In some sciences , for instance , proper citations list only the author , journal , and pages . They omit the article 's title . If you did that in the humanities or social sciences , you 'd be incorrect because proper citations for those fields require the title . Go figure . // Compare these bibliographic citations for an article of mine : // Chicago Lipson , Charles . " Why Are Some International Agreements Informal ? " International Organization 45 ( Autumn 1991 ) : 495-538. // APA Lipson , C. ( 1991 ) . Why are some international agreements informal ? International Organization , 45 , 495-538. // ACS Lipson , C. Int . Org. 1991 , 45 , 495. // None of these is complicated , but they are different . When you leave the chemistry lab to take a course on Shakespeare , you 'll leave behind your citation style as well as your beakers . Not to worry . For chemistry papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to chapter 4 , which covers MLA citations for the humanities . Both chapters include lots of examples , presented in simple tables , so it wo n't be " double , double toil and trouble . " // Despite their differences , all these citation styles have the same basic goals : // to identify and credit the sources you use ; and // to give readers specific information so they can go to these sources themselves , if they wish . // Fortunately , the different styles include a lot of the same information . That means you can write down the same things as you take notes , without worrying about what kind of citations you will ultimately use . You should write down that information as soon as you start taking notes on a new book or article . If you photocopy an article , write all the reference information on the first page . If you do it first , you wo n't forget . You 'll need it later for citations. // How these citations will ultimately look depends on which style you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus a complete description in the bibliography or in a previous note . Their name comes from their original source , The Chicago Manual of Style , published by the University of Chicago Press . This format is sometimes called " Turabian " after a popular book based on that style , Kate Turabian 's A Manual for Writers of Term Papers , Theses , and Dissertations . // If you use complete-citation notes , you might not need a bibliography at all since the first note for each item includes all the necessary data . If you use the shortened form , though , you definitely need a bibliography since the notes skip vital information . // Whether you use complete-citation notes or the shortened version , you can place them either at the bottom of each page or at the end of the document . Footnotes and endnotes are identical , except for their placement . Footnotes appear on the same page as the citation in the text . Endnotes are bunched together at the end of the paper , article , chapter , or book . Word processors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MLA , APA , and the science citation styles were developed to provide alternative ways of referencing materials . They use in-text citations such as ( Stewart 154 ) or ( Stewart , 2004 ) with full information provided only in a reference list at the end . Because these in-text citations are brief , they require a full bibliography . I 'll describe each style in detail and provide lots of examples , just as I will for Chicago citations. // In case you are wondering about the initials : APA stands for the American Psychological Association , which uses this style in its professional journals . MLA stands for the Modern Language Association . Both styles have been adopted well beyond their original fields . APA is widely used in the social sciences , MLA in the humanities . Chicago citations are widely used in both . I will discuss the science styles ( and what their initials mean ) a little later . // Your department , school , or publisher may prefer one style or even require it , or they might leave it up to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in papers with citations . Why not do it consistently from the beginning ? // Tip on selecting a citation style : Check with your teachers in each class to find out what style citations they prefer . Then use that style consistently . // Speaking of consistency ... it 's an important aspect of footnoting . Stick with the same abbreviations , capitalizations , and do n't mix styles within a paper . It 's easy to write " Volume " in one footnote , " Vol. " in another , and " vol. " in a third . We all do it , and then we have to correct it . We all abbreviate " chapter " as both " chap . " and " ch . " Just try your best the first time around and then go back and fix the mistakes when you revise . That 's why they invented the search-and-replace function . // My goal here is to provide a one-stop reference so that you can handle nearly all citation issues you 'll face , regardless of which style you use and what kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll show you how to cite books , articles , unpublished papers , Web sites , and lots more . For specialized documents , such as musical scores or scientific preprints , I show citations only in the fields that actually use them . Physicists often cite preprints , but they do n't cite Beethoven . The physics chapter reflects those needs . Students in the humanities not only cite Beethoven ; they cite dance performances , plays , and poems . I have included MLA citations for all of them . In case you need to cite something well off the beaten path , I 'll explain where to find additional information for each style . // HANGING INDENTS // One final point about shared bibliographic style . Most bibliographies-Chicago , MLA , APA , and some of the sciences-use a special style known as " hanging indents . " This applies only to the bibliography and not to footnotes or endnotes . It is the opposite of regular paragraph indention , where the first line is indented and the rest are regular length . In a hanging indent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest are indented . For example : // Rothenberg , Gunther E. " Maurice of Nassau , Gustavus Adolphus , Raimondo Montecuccoli , and the Military Revolution ' of the Seventeenth Century . " In Makers of Modern Strategy from Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age , edited by Peter Paret , 32-63 . Princeton , NJ : Princeton University Press , 1986. // Spooner , Frank C. Risks at Sea : Amsterdam Insurance and Maritime Europe , 1766-1780 . Cambridge : Cambridge University Press , 1983. // There 's a good reason for this unusual format . Hanging indents are designed to make it easy to skim down the list of references and see the authors ' names . To remind you to use this format , I 'll use it myself when I illustrate references in the citation styles that use it . ( The only ones that do n't use hanging indents are science styles with numbered citations and legal citations . It 's actually not complicated , and I 'll explain it later. ) // To make the authors ' names stand out further , most bibliographies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is repeated , however , the styles differ . APA repeats the full name for each citation . MLA uses three hyphens , followed by a period . Chicago uses three em dashes ( that is , long dashes ) , followed by a period . // Lipson , Charles . Barbecue , Cole Slaw , and Extra Hot Sauce . Midnight , MS : Hushpuppy , 2006. //  --  . More Gumbo , Please . Thibodeaux , LA : Andouille Press , 2005. // You can arrange hanging indents easily on your word processor . Go to the format feature and , within it , the section on paragraphs . Choose hanging indentation instead of regular or none . // WHERE TO FIND MORE // So far , we have covered some basic issues that apply to most citation styles . There are , of course , lots more questions , some that apply to all styles and some that apply only to one or two . Rather than cover these questions now , I 'll handle them in the chapters on individual citation styles and in a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have questions that are n't covered in the chapter on your citation style , be sure to check the FAQ chapter . If you still have questions , you can always go to the reference books for each style . Most styles have them ( but not all ) . I 'll list them in the chapters for individual styles . // ON TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS // I have organized the references so they are most convenient for you , putting all the documentation for each style in its own chapter . // Chapter 3 : Chicago ( or Turabian ) citations // Chapter 4 : MLA citations for the humanities // Chapter 5 : APA citations for the social sciences , education , engineering , and business // Chapter 6 : AAA citations for anthropology and ethnography // Chapter 7 : CSE citations for the biological sciences // Chapter 8 : AMA citations for the biomedical sciences , medicine , and nursing // Chapter 9 : ACS citations for chemistry // Chapter 10 : Physics , astrophysics , and astronomy citations // Chapter 11 : Mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citations // Chapter 13 : ALWD legal citations // Fortunately , they 're very straightforward . They 're mostly examples , showing you how to cite specific kinds of sources , such as the third edition of a popular book or a chapter in an edited volume . I 've included lots of examples of electronic documents , too , from Weblogs and databases to electronic versions of print documents . // Do n't bother trying to memorize any of these styles . There are simply too many minor details . Just follow the tables , and you 'll be able to handle different sources-from journal articles to Web pages-in whichever style you need to use . Later , as you write more papers , you 'll become familiar with the style you use most . // After explaining each style , I 'll answer some common questions that apply to all of them . That 's in chapter 14 . Now , let 's see how to do citations and bibliographies in the specific style you want to use . //          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
