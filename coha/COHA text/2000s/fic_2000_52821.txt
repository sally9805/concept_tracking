At the Boston airport they were separated . Julien had to go through the line for foreigners . He was carrying his big black artist 's portfolio , five feet by three , zipped up . In it were plans for all his major architectural projects . He looked very respectable , if pale . Austin , of course , had been waved through Immigration , and he waited impatiently just on the other side for Julien before they went down to pick up their luggage . <p> To Austin 's horror , Julien , whose English was still very approximate , was held at the Immigration desk for many long minutes . The stony-faced guard kept typing numbers or letters into his computer and studying the screen . He then asked Julien to step aside for a moment . Julien was smiling and nodding , even bowing , but he looked deadly pale . Another man in a business suit , tall , slightly balding , thin , finally appeared and led Julien into an office . There were no windows in the office ; Austin could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister Meg had driven over in her station wagon to meet their plane . She was going to load up the back of her car with their things and drive them the fifty or sixty miles to Providence . Austin had met her just once . He went downstairs to the baggage room and piled high two carts with the duffel bags . He did n't touch Julien 's luggage , since he thought he might have to identify his bags to the authorities . Maybe they 'd mixed him up with someone else , a smuggler . <p> Austin worried that once he went past Customs he would n't be allowed back into the Immigration area , but he could n't keep Meg waiting , either ; she 'd see from the Arrivals monitor that their plane had come in on time . As soon as he went through the last doors , which swung open automatically , Austin spotted Meg , a young woman as handsome as Peter but younger , less careworn . She was entirely healthy in appearance , the sort of sporty New England girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in makeup . She was n't masculine ; there was even something fawnlike about her narrow face and big gray eyes ; but she would have appeared more relaxed with a hockey stick in her hands than in her camel-hair coat with a black leather handbag dangling from her forearm . <p> Austin said , " I do n't know what 's happening . They 're interrogating my friend Julien . You should n't hang around . We can always get a taxi . " <p> " A taxi ? That will cost you a hundred dollars ! " <p> Six hundred francs , Austin thought . " That 's okay . This could go on for hours . " <p> " I 'll stay here with you for a while , at least . " <p> Austin thanked her . Shaking all over , he told himself to stay calm . Meg guarded his two carts and nine duffel bags while he went over to a Bureau de Change and cashed three one-hundred-dollar traveler 's checks . He 'd need money in any event . The people who were letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys ; he 'd bought their car from them , sight unseen . Once he got there he 'd have the car <p> But what about Julien ? He suddenly saw the balding man in the business suit hurrying along , and Austin rushed up to him . He explained that he was traveling with the Frenchman who was being retained . " What 's wrong ? " <p> " I 'm not at liberty to say . " <p> " Well , will he get through ? " <p> " I ca n't tell you that . " <p> " When will I know something ? I left his baggage on the carousel . " <p> " The luggage has been brought up to my office . It 's safe . " <p> " That young lady is waiting to drive us to Providence . What should I tell her ? " <p> " She 'd be best advised to leave . This could take some time . " <p> " That means he will be coming on through in a few hours ? " Austin raised his eyebrows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " No , it does n't mean that at all . It does n't mean anything . " <p> " Ca n't you tell me what the problem is ? " <p> " What is your relationship to the gentleman ? " <p> " Friend . " <p> " No , in that case no . " <p> " Should I just wait here , then ? " <p> " That 's entirely up to you . " <p> " Could you be so kind as to come back eventually , I mean after everything 's been decided , and tell me what to expect ? " <p> The man , who refused to return Austin 's social smiles and seemed impervious to Austin 's charm or even his quandary , looked at him coolly and said in French , " We 'll see . " <p> " Merci infiniment , " Austin said . It seemed grotesque that two Americans in America were speaking French to each other . Did he think that Austin was really French ? Was he , this official ? Why was n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Reluctantly , Meg glanced at her watch after an hour and said , " I 've got to get home eventually and prepare dinner for my husband and kid . Dick ... you remember Dick ? He took the day off to look after the baby , but he 's hopeless in the kitchen . Unless you need me ? " Here she patted his arm in a psychiatric way , at once reassuring and distant . Austin felt sorry for her ; she 'd wanted to do a favor for the man who 'd lived with her brother so many years . He knew that all the sisters had grown closer since they 'd found out Peter had AIDS . Perhaps Meg had planned to discuss Peter 's health with him . She was barely thirty , and she already had to accept the imminent death of her only brother , the only boy of the five children , this strangely unsuccessful , unmotivated , Europeanized problem in an otherwise hardworking American family ( Meg was an award-winning kindergarten teacher with her own weekly educational television show in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' pharmacy ; Ellen banded migrating birds in a Tidewater reserve ; Toni was a Chicago fabric wholesaler ... ) . <p> But Meg 's kindness , even her clearly indicated American " concern " in the way she knitted her unlined , silken brow to suggest how she felt for him , irritated Austin ; irrationally he blamed her for " America 's " rejection of his lover . Austin 's heart was pounding , he 'd soaked his way through his shirt , and he was caught up in alternating gusts of frenzy and lassitude . He 'd start to gossip in a chummy way with Meg , then suddenly erupt in a panic over what was happening . " What do you think it could be ? " <p> " Maybe there 's something funny about his passport ? " <p> " That 's it ! " Austin exclaimed , snapping his fingers . " Ethiopia ! He lived in Ethiopia , and these Boston goons are going bananas over the stamps . A spy ! A bomb ! Communism ! " But then Austin immediately regretted what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive directional microphones picking up everything he was saying ? For their benefit he added , just in case , " Of course I 'm joking . It must be something else . " <p> At last Meg left . Austin was secretly relieved , because he feared that if and when Julien came out he 'd be too shaken to make polite conversation with a stranger in English . Nor would he like to find Austin smiling and nodding while he , Julien , had been so anxious . More than once Julien had accused Austin of being more concerned about pleasing a stranger than loyally helping a friend  --  or his lover . <p> Eventually the announcement on the big board of the arrival of their plane was effaced . A popcorn machine somewhere ( he could n't see it ) filled the warmed air with its distinctive movie-theater smell . A family of redheads , speaking with penetrating R-less Boston accents , was standing next to him . They looked as though they 'd been dressed by Goodwill : the mother wore a dirty gray parka with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were covered with cat hairs , and her black boots had been bleached in patches by snow-melting salt . Her hair was flattened on the side where she must have slept . The older boy , dressed in a shirt stiff with dried orange juice , was coolly dribbling an imaginary basketball and , when their mother was n't looking , quickly socking his little brother in the ribs . The little boy would start wailing each time . His face was filthy from crying and from rubbing snot over it . " Jason ! " the mother shouted . Outside , through the plate-glass windows , he could see that night was falling rapidly . Car lights were pivoting as they turned through the thickening darkness and shone on the slushy road . <p> After two hours went by , the same balding man came up to Austin and said in French , " He 's being sent back on the next plane to Paris at his expense . You can talk to him for ten minutes . Come with me . " The man led him not through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to stop three times while the man tapped a code into a lock and swiped his badge through a magnetic-band detector . At last they arrived at a higher floor and a hallway of plain metal doors and curtained windows . It seemed deserted . The only smell was of Lysol . A uniformed soldier armed with a rifle was stationed outside one door . The balding man unlocked the door and let Austin in . " I 'll be back in ten minutes , " he said . <p> " What a warm welcome America has extended , " Austin said . Julien looked smaller and dirtier , his beard growing in quickly . They held hands for a moment , but Julien , looking around nervously for a concealed camera , drew away . <p> " What went wrong ? " Austin asked . <p> " Our stupid lawyer did n't tell us that if you apply for a professional visa you ca n't come in on a tourist visa while you 're waiting for it to come through . You really should demand your money back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think they 're funny , but look at the mess they 've gotten us into . When I was going through the line they typed in my name and saw I 'd applied for a professional visa . Thanks to your advice I was all dressed up as if for a job interview with my entire portfolio under my arm . If I 'd had on shorts and a Hawaiian shirt they probably would have waved me through . " <p> " When do you go back ? " <p> " On the very next plane , which we have to pay for . It 's the same plane we arrived on . It wo n't be ready till tonight . " <p> " Can you pay with your credit card ? " Austin had made him a partner on his American Express account . <p> " They 'll accept the return ticket I already had . " <p> " Petit , do n't worry , " Austin said . " I 'll call my landlady and get my apartment back for a few days , and I 'll fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll call the president of the college here and get him to put pressure on our senator to hurry up your visa . Here , take this money . " He gave him the two thousand francs he still had in his wallet . " Was that man difficult ? " <p> " He made me speak in English for hours and then only at the end did he say something in perfect French . I think maybe he is French . The bastard ... " <p> " Where will you go in Paris ? " <p> " I 'll stay with Christine , " Julien said . Of course he had no choice , since he 'd already sublet his apartment , but the words crossed Austin 's mind , I 'll lose him to his wife . He knew she had only a double bed and her couch was n't long enough or stable enough to sleep on . In another week Julien would be learning his HIV test results . He 'd given up his job , his wife , his apartment , his country and his language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it had n't worked out . " I 'll call Christine to tell her you 're on your way . She should be there tomorrow morning when you arrive . " <p> " Tomorrow ?  --  Oh . I 'm so tired . Anyway , I have my own key . " <p> " You do ? To her apartment ? " <p> " It was also my apartment . She never changed the locks . Why should she ? " <p> The man came to the door . Austin stood up . " I 'll call you tomorrow when you 're back in Paris . " <p> He had to load up his nine duffel bags in a taxi . Night had fallen , even though it was only four-thirty in the afternoon . The driver was a turbaned Sikh . Austin sat huddled up in a corner of the back seat , hating the Sikh and his loud voice as he shouted in his language into a mobile phone . He sounded furious , but from time to time , amazingly , he laughed , so apparently it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Austin tried to imagine the dog 's dinner of dirty hair under the pomegranate-colored turban  --  they never cut their hair , did they ? And how the hell did he get into the U.S. of A. with his dog 's dinner hairdo and gold teeth , shouting away in his own language , when a well-dressed , well-behaved French architect was kept under armed guard and sent home over a technicality ? They should never have applied for a professional visa . During all his years in France , Austin had been a tourist . <p> They were traveling on the very dark , forest-lined highway toward Providence at just fifty-five miles an hour , which seemed unbearably slow compared to French speeds . Luckily the Sikh 's telephone signal had faded . Austin told him the story . The driver said , " Yes , Immigration is a bother . But do n't lose faith . " <p> " How did you get in ? " <p> " My wife is American . " <p> " How did you meet her ? Was she a tourist in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an arranged marriage . She 's Sikh , too . " <p> The highway , which had been dug ten feet lower than the surrounding town , wound gently through the outskirts of Providence . All the houses were of wood and looked huge . Despite their size they had almost no space between them , though he could scarcely see anything , so dimly lit were the streets . Here it was , just six or seven in the evening , and the streets were deserted . It was much colder than in Paris . The streets had been cleared of snow , which was piled high in banks on the sidewalks . Now they 'd turned off the highway , and the driver was looking for someone he could ask directions from . But there was no one around . Presumably this was the downtown , but half the stores were boarded up . They went all around a three-block-long esplanade between unlit government buildingsAustin had forgotten Providence was the state capital . Someone had said Rhode Island was one of the poorest states in the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ten most livable cities in the country . The thought made Austin laugh ghoulishly . Finally they spotted a brightly lit chrome diner , or rather it was a take-out truck ; several white teenagers were standing in front of it , blowing on their hands and stamping their feet against the cold . " We 'll ask them , " Austin said , but in a moment the car was surrounded by the kids , who were pounding on the roof . <p> " Lock the doors , " the driver said . <p> " Go home , Towel Head . " The Ayatollah had recently aroused American ire , Austin had read in the Herald-Tribune . When they drove off , the teens shouted , " Faggots ! " <p> " Very nasty , " the driver said . <p> At last a filling-station operator gave them directions , and they arrived at the proper address . The house belonged to the Professor of Aesthetics at the college ; he and his wife were on a sabbatical in Italy . Austin 's key worked . The Sikh helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he left .
