It was a distressing , but hardly surprising , phone call . On the line was a regular contributor to Transitions Online ( the magazine I edit for ) . Still in shock , she was calling to tell me that she had just been put on one month 's unpaid leave from her newspaper in Russia . <p> She was the only reporter left on staff . <p> By now , stories of dying newspapers have become familiar to readers in the United States . But whereas in the West the phenomenon is largely a result of declining circulation and competition from online publications , in Russia and elsewhere it has been helped along mightily by governments . ( See story , page 10 . ) <p> As independent voices fall silent , the world faces yet more places , from Albania to Zimbabwe , where opposition politicians have limited access to media and where dissenting opinions can make themselves heard only through violence or extremism . <p> Independent , and often critical of the Kremlin , our contributor 's newspaper received no lucrative government advertising revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies had all but dried up . The paper has since limped back , heavily reliant on wire services , but its future remains in doubt . <p> As she had written in a recent column for us , " Government officials across Russia have close ties with the business community , and , for any private media enterprise , a clash with powerful people may result in direct financial losses . Russian editors have learned to read the warning signs . " <p> In a report released in January , the National Endowment for Democracy 's Center for International Media Assistance ( CIMA ) examined the apparently growing problem of " soft censorship " : governments using their advertising funds , or pressuring private companies to use theirs , to reward sympathetic media and to punish critical outlets . <p> Our correspondent in Albania , Besar Likmeta , wrote of a carrot-and-stick approach used by that country 's government toward the media . The stick : harassment , newly discovered delinquent tax bills , and straightforward fines . <p> The carrot : " The benefits for compliant media include long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting corruption and in building schools and infrastructure , " Mr. Likmeta wrote . <p> In many of these countries , newspapers have been the only independent voices , so it is mostly print journalism that is being targeted . In Russia , the Kremlin long ago took direct control of some television channels and made sure that others were in friendly hands . <p> The Internet is hardly a suitable substitute . In many of these countries , its penetration is still negligible . In the most repressive places , websites are blocked or patrons of Internet cafes must provide identification upon entering so that , at best , they will be intimidated into avoiding websites deemed questionable by the government . At worst , they can be tracked down later . <p> The CIMA report cites an example brought to light in September by Mexico 's Center for Journalism and Public Ethics ( CEPET ) : <p> " CEPET released word that Gov . Mario Marin Torres of Puebla State denied advertising contracts to three online news sites that were critical of his administration and had reported on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rodolfo Ruiz Rodriguez , the director of one of the three online newspapers , e-consulta , told CEPET , ' It 's absurdly unfair ; they provide contracts to media outlets that have no ratings and that can not provide valid circulation numbers , yet they cut us off because we are critical . " <p> Some commentators have argued that the root of the problem is government advertising itself . Surely the kind of self-congratulatory propaganda that Likmeta cites in Albania is a waste . But there is a place in the pages of a newspaper for public health and education campaigns , as well as for public notices of bids and calls for proposals . Without such advertising , government is less open and less responsive to its citizens . <p> Many outlets in countries where the private sector and its attendant commercial advertising are underdeveloped will remain dependent on government advertising . <p> The CIMA report offers a few possible solutions , such as promoting transparency in the awarding of government advertising contracts , requiring governments to place advertising in outlets that reach the intended audience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places where press freedom laws exist but are not enforced , taking the matter to court . <p> The good news is that countries wanting to join NATO have to have democratic governments , and the European Union requires adoption - and enforcement - of a host of laws that ensure basic freedoms . However , the European Commission also should recognize the problem of soft censorship . <p> As for the rest ? In poorer countries , little foreign aid is tied to reform of such practices . Even in countries that have the trappings of democracy - throughout the former communist bloc in Europe , for instance - citizens have little history of a free press and tend to react with a shrug to issues of media manipulation or intimidation . <p> And then there 's Russia . In its most recent Media Sustainability Index report , the nonprofit International Research and Exchanges Board , which works to develop independent media and civil society , cited an October 2007 survey that found only 2 percent of Russians regard the freedom to receive and disseminate information by any lawful means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some Russians have looked the other way as long as their standard of living and Russia 's prestige were on the upswing . Perhaps that will change as more independent voices go silent or as people 's financial situations sour during this downturn . <p> Russia , of all places , provides a model for how independent newspapers can survive . Novaya Gazeta , where frequent Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya worked until she was gunned down in 2006 , publishes thanks to the largess of its deep-pocketed owners , Mikhail Gorbachev and oligarch Alexander Lebedev . <p> Further , throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia , small , grant-funded , largely online publications that , like mine , double as journalism training centers , are reaching young reporters fed up with the twisted journalism they see at home . Helping to support independent media around the globe is going to have to become an exercise in philanthropy . <p> A change in laws or attitude must come along to rescue some of these media , otherwise the economic crisis will likely just finish the job that their governments started . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ) Copyright 2009 .
