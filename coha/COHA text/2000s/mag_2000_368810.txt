Flu season is nearly upon us , and millions of Americans will soon be turning to a dubious " remedy " widely available at health-food stores and pharmacies . It 's called Oscillococcinum , a tongue-twister of a potion that , according to its label , provides " temporary relief of colds and flulike symptoms . " It is the standard homeopathic treatment for influenza and goes for about $10 a box . But like other homeopathic products , it 's basically worthless . <P> The first clue is the " 200C " on the label . What this means is that whatever active ingredient Oscillococcinum began with  --  in this case , duck heart and liver ( no quack jokes , please )  --  has been diluted beyond all imagining . First , one part of the active ingredient is combined with a hundred parts of solvent . Next , the mixture is shaken and diluted again at one part per hundred  --  a process that is repeated a total of 200 times . Finally , sugar granules soaked in the resulting solution are enclosed in six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The laborious dilution process is not unique to Oscillococcinum . It is the bedrock of homeopathy , a mystical specialty invented in the early 19th century by Samuel Hahnemann , a German physician . Homeopaths today still rely on his " law of similars , " which holds that tiny quantities of a substance that in larger amounts produces symptoms of a disease will cure that disease . Another homeopathic dictum , the " law of infinitesimals , " states that the smaller the dose , the more powerful the effect . <P> That theory is reflected on the labels of homeopathic preparations , in which the number of dilutions is represented by Xs ( each X representing a 1-to-10 dilution ) and Cs ( hundredfold dilutions ) . Yet by the laws of chemistry , there is only a 50% chance that a single molecule of the original substance remains in a 24X dilution . In the case of Oscillococcinum ( 200C ) , the chance that even one avian molecule has survived is virtually nil . <P> Then how does the so-called active ingredient of homeopathic brews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces ) , during the shaking process , which they call succussion , a " memory " of the original active ingredient is somehow retained by the surrounding solution . Sheer mumbo jumbo without a shred of evidence , say most scientists . <P> Homeopathic preparations are hardly dangerous . Even those that use deadly poisons as active ingredients are so diluted that they should cause no harm . Many users swear that their minor ailments have been cured through homeopathy . But scientists argue that the placebo effect  --  whereby belief in a treatment will provide relief  --  is probably at work . It 's likely that the symptoms would have disappeared anyway with no medical intervention . <P> The bottom line is that the manufacturers of homeopathic remedies are raking in hundreds of millions of dollars a year for products that may be no more effective than ordinary tap water and are probably not as pure . Yet proponents abound , particularly in Europe . A standard boast , in fact , is that the British royal family uses and believes in homeopathic products . <P> I rest my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
