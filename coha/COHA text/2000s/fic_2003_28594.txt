Chapter One " You ca n't be a coward forever . " Carlie chuckled , despite her nervousness . " Quit pushing , Bren . You 're not going to provoke me into rushing out into the party dressed like this . " " Rushing ? You 're already ten minutes late . " She had parked in the back of the house , away from the main flow of human traffic entering the party . Small , twinkling lights surrounded the pool and pool house , even though the weather was too brisk for swimming . " And that 's your fault . What were you thinking , to pick me a costume that was so ... so ... " Carlie could n't quite find the words to describe the skimpy harem outfit her best friend had chosen for her . If she had to go to Brenda 's stupid Halloween party at all , she would have preferred to be a pumpkin or a witch . Anything that was less revealing . " So ... what ? You look fantastic . What 's wrong with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to loosen up a little and try socializing . Talk to people . " " You mean men , do n't you ? " Carlie shook her head . " I 'm not a hermit , Bren . I have my students and more than enough school activities to keep me busy . " Then she glanced down at herself . " What were you thinking ? " " You said you did n't have time to pick out an outfit yourself . " Brenda lifted one shoulder in a halfhearted shrug . " Besides , you make a very sexy harem girl . All the single men here tonight will drool . It 'll do you good to realize how attractive you can be when you are n't hiding behind those hideous suits . " Carlie winced . She was feeling far from attractive . Exhibited , displayed and downright exposed was more accurate . She was pretty certain she looked ridiculous more than anything else . " Which single men , exactly , did you invite ? " Brenda waved her hand in dismissal . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason 's associates , a few neighbors , friends ... Tyler . " Carlie went perfectly still for a heartbeat , then frowned at Brenda . " Tyler Ramsey at a costume party ? I did n't think your notorious brother-in-law would bother with something so - " " Do n't make fun of my party , Carlie . " " I was n't . I just thought fancy banquets were more his speed . " Carlie could n't imagine Tyler dressed in a costume . He always seemed so ... suave . And he always had a very sophisticated , very elegant woman on his arm . " Tyler came because Jason asked him , and he would never let his brother down . You know how close they are . " Brenda shook her head and added , " You know , you and Tyler actually have a few things in common . " Carlie turned away . " You 're dreaming , Bren . We live in different worlds . " " You just do n't understand Tyler . He had it pretty rough growing up , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at least Jason was always there for him . " " My brother had his own life , " Carlie said . " And he was right , my problems were my own . " " Jason would never turn Tyler away if he needed help . " " Jason 's a terrific guy . But he and Tyler are nothing alike . " " Not now , maybe , but they used to be , " Brenda said with a grin . " But then , Jason met me . I think Tyler will be the same . When he finds someone he cares about ... " Carlie narrowed her eyes and stiffened her shoulders . " That will be a little hard for him to do when his relationships rarely last long enough to get to know a woman . " Brenda stared at Carlie , her eyebrows raised . " You seem to be keeping pretty close track of my young brother-in-law . " " He 's not that young . " But Carlie flushed at being caught . " I mean , he 's a grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , never mind . " " Tyler 's a good guy , Carlie . He may change dates a lot , but that 's because the women he usually hooks up with are only impressed by his status in the community and his expanding financial portfolio . Tyler thinks he wants a no-strings attachment , but he 's never satisfied with it . " Carlie had a feeling it was Tyler 's looks and outrageous charm that really attracted women , but she kept her mouth shut . She certainly did n't want Brenda to get the idea she had a crush on Tyler Ramsey . Good grief . A crush ! No , she did n't . Certainly not . Carlie was shaking her head at her errant thoughts , even as she said , " You do n't have to defend Tyler to me , Bren . What he does is no concern of mine . " " Fine . Then if you 're done stalling , can we get back to the party now ? I think it 's about to rain . " Carlie glanced up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . " You go on , Bren . I think I 'll just wait a few more minutes . " Brenda hesitated , then she nodded . " Do n't be too long . " Too long ? Carlie wondered if another hour or so would be too long . She truly did n't relish the idea of going inside , not that anyone would recognize her . Dressed so differently , no one would see her as Carlie McDaniels , grade-school teacher and spinster extraordinaire . Her persona this evening was as far from her usual self as a woman could get . Even her hair and eyes were different , thanks to the wig that came with the costume , and the colored contacts she was wearing . She was a coward , true , but it had been two long years since her divorce , and though that had been enough time for her to gain her independence and put some order to her life , it had n't been time enough to repair her confidence in herself as a woman . Brenda claimed Carlie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely different claim . Shivering , she forced her mind away from the disturbing memories , mustered her courage and started toward the door . She could make Brenda happy by mingling for an hour or so , then she could make her escape . The thought of her small , tidy , empty house seemed very nice all of a sudden .
