Chapter One The first thing I learned about Travis Becker was that he parked his motorcycle on the front lawn . You could see the tracks of it all the way up that rolling hill , cutting deeply into the beautiful , golf course-like grass . That should have told me all I needed to know , right there . I 'm not usually a reckless person . What happened the summer of my junior year was not about recklessness . It was about the way a moment , a single moment , could change things and make you decide to try to be someone different . I 'm sure I made that decision the very moment I saw that metal , the glint of it in the sun , looking hot to the touch , looking like an invitation . Charles Whitney - he too made a decision like that , way back on August 14 , 1945 , just as he ground a cigarette into the street with the toe of his shoe , and so did my mother when she decided that we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me . Shy is the usual word . I 'm one of those people doomed to be known by a single , dominant feature . You know the people I mean - the Fat Girl , the Tall Guy , the Brain . I 'm The Quiet Girl . I even heard someone say it a few years ago , as I sat in a bathroom stall . " Do you know Ruby McQueen ? " someone said . I think it was Wendy Craig , whose ankles I had just whacked with too much pleasure during floor hockey . And then came the answer : " Oh , is she That Quiet Girl ? " I blame my quiet status on two embarrassing incidents , although my mother will say that I 've always just been a watchful person by nature , doing my own anthropological study of the human race , like Jane Goodall and The Chimpanzees of Gombe . She is probably right that personality plays a part . I sometimes feel less hardy and cut out for the world than the people around me , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inanimate objects - the sock without a partner , a field of snow interrupted by footprints , the lone berry on a branch . But it is also true that humiliating experiences can wither your confidence sure as salt on a slug . I was reasonably outgoing in the fifth grade , before I slipped on some glossy advertising circulars in our garage , broke my tailbone , and had to bring an inflatable doughnut to sit on at school . Before this I would actually raise my hand , stand at the front of a line , not be afraid to be noticed . My stomach seizes up into knots of humiliation just remembering that doughnut . It looks like a toilet seat , Brian Holmes cracked , and the above mentioned Wendy Craig laughed . And he was right ; it did - like those puffy ones that you see in tacky , overdecorated bathrooms . I had begun to put it all behind me , pardon the pun . I 'd nearly erased the memory of Mark Cummings and Dede Potter playing Frisbee with the doughnut during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , that Brian Holmes would no doubt end up prematurely bald and teaching remedial math , and that Mark Cummings was gay , only he did n't know it yet . Then it happened again : humiliating experience , part two . Just when you thought it was safe to get back in the water . This time it was my own fault . I 'd placed a pair of minipads in the armpits of my blouse so I would n't soak my underarms with nervous sweat during a science speech , and one sailed out as I motioned to my display board . At home , peeling the paper strips and sticking the pads in my shirt had seemed ingenious . Why had no one thought of this before ? But as soon as I started to speak , I could feel the right one loosen and slip with every small gesture . I tried to keep my arm clutched tight to my side , soldierlike . Just because an organism is one-celled , does n't mean it is dull and uninteresting . Finally , I had no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the minipad shot like a toboggan on an icy slope , landing on the floor in white , feminine-hygiene victory . The crowds roared . So I became quiet . This seemed the safe thing to do when embarrassments hunted me like a stalker hunts a former lover . Again my mother tried her wisdom on me - Laugh it off , she said . Everyone else is too busy trying to forget their own humiliations to remember yours . You 're no different than anyone else . Why do you think that years later we still have dreams that we went to school and forgot to get dressed ? And again , this might be true . Still , it seems to me that if I get a pimple it will be in the middle of my forehead like an Indian bindi , and if the answer is spermatozoa , I 'm the one that will be called on . I 've just found that it 's best to lie low . Quiet People , I can tell you , usually have friends who play the violin way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't another way you can get your coffee at Starbucks . My friend Karen Jen won the Youth Math Extravaganza ( I noticed that the bold letters on the sweatshirt she got spelled Y ME , but I did n't mention this to her ) , and Sarah Elliott and I became friends in P.E . because the V-sit was the highlight of our gymnastics ability . Last winter , Sarah made a wild pass of her basketball and whacked Ms. Thronson of Girl 's State Volleyball Championship fame on the back of the head . One minute there was Ms. Thronson , her shoulders as big as the back of a dump truck , blowing her whistle - Threeep ! And the next minute , bam , she was down on her knees as if praying for forgiveness for making us do that unit on wrestling . Sometimes you do n't know your own strength . If you are kind , or were one of my friends in the pre-doughnut days , you 've cringed for me over the years , sending supportive thoughts with a glance . But maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read aloud in English class ( because reading aloud means that Mrs. Forrester can grade papers rather than really teach ) , you also notice that my voice is clearer and stronger than you thought it would be . When I read Fitzgerald , when I read the part about the light at the end of Gatsby 's dock , you see that Mrs. Forrester puts down her red pen and pauses with her coffee cup halfway to her lips , her eyebrows knitted slightly in a look of the softest concentration . That 's when you wonder if there might be more to me . More than the glimpse of my coat flying out behind me as I escape out the school doors toward home . At least that 's what I hope you think . Maybe you 're just thinking about what you 're going to have for lunch . Old Anna Bee , one of the Casserole Queens , told me the same thing once , that there was more to me . She took one finger , knobby from years of gardening , and tapped my temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so that I would be sure to take in her meaning . I liked the way it sounded - as if I lead a life of passion and adventure , the stuff of a good book of fiction , just no one knows it . It sounded like I have secret depths . And I guess for one summer , just one summer , maybe it was true . I did have passion and adventure in my life , the stuff of the books at the Nine Mile Falls Library where my mother works . Summer , after all , is a time when wonderful things can happen to quiet people . For those few months you 're not required to be who everyone thinks you are , and that cut-grass smell in the air and the chance to dive into the deep end of a pool give you a courage you do n't have the rest of the year . You can be graceful and easy , with no eyes on you , and no past . Summer just opens the door and lets you out . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I got that brief glimpse of Travis Becker 's motorcycle on the long lawn of the Becker estate . I had walked home by myself that day , instead of with my friend Sydney , as I usually do . Sydney has lived next door to me forever ; we both have movies of us when we were babies , sitting in one of those blow-up wading pools , screaming our heads off . " We 're only screaming because of those bathing suits you guys had us in . They look like the kind you see at the community pool on the old ladies recovering from heart surgery . They 've got skirts , for God 's sake , " Sydney said one night as we all watched the movies at her house . " You were babies . The old ladies , by the way , only require heart surgery after seeing what girls wear to the beach these days , " my mother said . " Personally , I think Sydney started screaming then and just never stopped , " her mother , Lizbeth , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lizbeth was probably right . Sydney was one of those people who were n't afraid to express themselves , through words , through clothes , through honking a horn at another car during her Driver 's Ed test . She once got grounded for grabbing the family goldfish out of the bowl and threatening to throw it at her brother during an argument . Sydney and her whole family , really , were the kind of people who made you feel that power was possible if you could only get to the point where you did n't care what anyone thought . Sydney was a year older than I was , and my only friend who did n't know more about algorithms than was actually good for the health . She was more like family , though . " You are a cool and beautiful person , " she had said to me after the minipad incident . " Just remember that high school is a big game where the blond , perfect ones sit on the sideline while everyone else crosses a mine field trying not to look stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She sounded a bit like my mother . " Being blond and perfect prepares you for nothing in life but being married to a brain-damaged former football jock named Chuck and having a license plate holder that says FOXY CHICK . " Next year when Sydney went off to college , I would miss her more than I could say . But that day , fate sent Sydney to the dentist , and I walked home on my own . I got to go the way I liked : the long way . After you get out of school and pass the Front Street Market and the used bookstore and the community theater where they put on plays that usually star Clive Weaver , our postman , you can go home two ways . Sydney 's way , the quickest on foot , is down a side street , cutting through Olsen 's Llama Farm and the property of Johnson 's Nursery . But I like to take the main road , Cummings Road , the same one we take in the mornings when Mom drives my brother and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls sits in the center of three mountains , and Cummings Road weaves through the valley of the largest one , Mount Solitude . When you walk , you can look at it all more closely - the winding streets named after trees that lead to snug neighborhoods ; the small houses that sit right on the road near town , with their lattice arbors and gardens packed tight with old roses . If you go far enough , you walk past the sprawling lawn of George Washington 's house , at least that 's our name for it , the huge colonial that is odd and unexpected in our Northwest town , as odd and unexpected as finding a decent car at Ron 's Auto , the place you pass next . Ron 's Auto is in a dilapidated building with old junkers parked in front and RON 'S spelled out in hubcaps on the fence . If you 're looking for a car that actually starts , I 'd probably look somewhere else . You get a little of everything on Cummings Road . Mom says it 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , distinct story . If that 's true , then it 's a shelf organized by wacky Bernice Rawlins , mom 's co-worker . When she puts away the books at the Nine Mile Falls Library , you never know what will end up where . She once put How to Be Lovers for the Rest of Your Lives in the children 's section next to Horton Hears A Who . The best part of Cummings Road , though , is Moon Point , a part of Mount Solitude . Paragliders leap from Moon Point in numbers that are almost mystical - thirty-five at one count , soaring like brilliant butterflies and floating so close to the road before they land that if you ever drive past in a convertible , you worry that a sudden , unexpected passenger might drop in . There is something special about the winds there , how they whip down from Mount Solitude and swirl back up again . I do n't know how it works ; I only know that people come from all over to paraglide off Moon Point . There 's even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , housed in an old barn . The club 's logo , wings carrying a heart aloft , is painted on the side of the barn , huge and colorful . You get all kinds at Moon Point - the professionals with their gliders all rolled up into neon cocoons and strapped to their backpacks with precision , and the people who do n't have a clue what they 're doing and get stuck in the trees . Chip Jr. , my younger brother , saw one once as we drove past . " There 's a paraglider in that tree , " he said , his face tilted up toward the window . I did n't believe him - Chip Jr . ' s favorite joke , after all , is telling you that he saw the governor in the men 's bathroom on his field trip to the state capitol . But sure enough , there was a guy stuck high in a fir , his legs dangling down and his glider tangled hopelessly in the branches . I love to see those paragliders weaving softly around Moon Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they drift in for a landing , their feet touch the ground and they trot forward from the continued motion of the glider , which billows down like a setting sun . I never get tired of watching them and I 've seen them thousands of times . I always wondered what that kind of freedom would feel like . That day , I stopped at Moon Point for a while . I walked past the row of cars that were always parked in front of the school - active , mud-splattered cars and trucks . I looked for my favorite one - the van with a whale painted on the side and an I LOVE POTHOLES bumper sticker , and was happy when I saw it there . A car with a sense of humor . I sat on the ground with my chin pointing upward and counted an even twenty paragliders soaring against the wooded backdrop of Mount Solitude . I stayed a long while , sat on the grass , and listened for the flapping sound of tight nylon wings against the wind . I had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my alarm clock went off , I could hear my mother running the vacuum . It was a bad sign , a sure start to at least three days of hurricane cleaning , endless whiffs of lemon Pledge , odd colored liquids in the toilet bowls , the seeek , seeek sound of paper towels wiping down ammonia-squirted mirrors . This cleaning - it meant that my father was coming . It meant that my mother would once again lose her heart to a man who was no longer even her husband , but whose ring she still wore on a chain around her neck . And it meant that my brother and I would be walking around the broken pieces of that heart for days after he left . I watched the paragliders until the sun snuck behind Mount Solitude . The shadow it cast quickly stole all of the summer heat , and so I decided to head home . Continues ...
