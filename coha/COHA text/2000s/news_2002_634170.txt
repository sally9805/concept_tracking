<p> Chicago caught a lucky break with the March 9 arrest by university police of a fugitive from Wisconsin who stored cyanide in a CTA tunnel . It 's good that Chicago is taking advantage of this wake-up call and making needed changes in CTA security . But why now , instead of last Sept. 11 ? <p> According to the Sun-Times ' March 12 report , authorities had " ticketed " this individual in November 2001 for trespassing in the CTA tunnels . Two questions beg to be answered : <p> *In the post-9/11 environment , how does any individual , much less an individual wanted on several felony warrants and who allegedly had sabotaged the electric power for an entire town in Wisconsin , only get stopped briefly by the authorities for being in the CTA tunnels , without an effective ID check ? How dare authorities downplay the danger of such a person . <p> *If the CTA really were in control of security in the subways , how could an individual set up shop and store poison there , and go undetected for weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security in the CTA tunnels after Sept. 11 , there would have been no need for the FBI to shut down the Blue Line for 15 consecutive hours on March 10 and inconvenience thousands of people . But it took the arrest on March 9 for the CTA to finally propose a complete inventory of its underground rooms , and for the Chicago Police Department to fingerprint trespassers . <p> Maybe now Chicago will take seriously the level of security necessary to maintain a subway system in an environment of world and domestic terrorism . But if you can walk into the subway and see a group of security personnel shooting the breeze together like before , you 'll know we 're not serious . The security in the London subways absolutely puts Chicago to shame . Calling a subway safe , and making a subway safe , are two entirely different things . <p> Albert Schorsch III , Dunning <p> Am I the only person out there who is more than a little concerned with the changes implemented by the Bush administration ? For example , we used to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal security . We had the CIA and NSA for external security , each of which followed the policies set forth by the National Security Council . <p> Now we have an Office of Homeland Security , which does the same as all of the above , apparently with much less congressional oversight . <p> Next , we have an Office of Strategic Information , whose sole purpose is to spread disinformation in the foreign media . This philosophy strikes me as ludicrous when anyone can get the Wall Street Journal , the New York Times , USA Today , Newsweek or U.S. News and World Report at just about any newsstand or major hotel anywhere in the world . Or will the OSI place its disinformation into all publications  --  both foreign and domestic ? <p> Then we have the " shadow government " bunker plan , designed to allow the continuance of government should a terrorist attack succeed in destroying the administration . Apparently , no one in the Bush White House has read his copy of the Constitution recently . <p> According to my copy , Article 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal of the president from office , or of his death , resignation , or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office , the same shall devolve on the vice-president and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal , death , resignation , or inability , both of the president and vice president , declaring what officer shall then act as president , and such officer shall act accordingly , until the disability be removed , or a president shall be elected . " Then there is Article 20 , Sections 3 and 4 . <p> Therefore , because the succession of government is already provided for , it would appear that the " shadow government " is contrary to the intentions of the Founding Fathers . However , that is a matter for the Supreme Court to interpret . Speaking of which , did anyone else notice that neither the Supreme Court nor the Congress is included in the " shadow government " ? Kind of makes you wonder , does n't it ? <p> Mark Abbott , Irving Park <p> Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 3rd Senate District is missing several pertinent facts that voters in the district need to be aware of before the March 19 primary . <p> State Sen. Margaret Smith is an active , progressive legislator who has fought for the citizens of the 3rd District since 1983 . The list of her accomplishments is long and is added to annually as she continues her community service in the district . Smith , who serves on the Democratic leadership team as the Caucus chairperson , has secured more than $85 million in funding for social service programs , job training , school improvements , youth programs , health care and a multitude of other worthy endeavors . <p> Several points in Dyson 's column should be clarified : <p> *It is Smith who the Chicago Sun-Times has endorsed . It is Smith who worked to get the seed money  --  $1.5 million  --  for the renovation of the Wabash YMCA . Without that first , vital commitment of funds , the project might never have happened . <p> *It is Smith who provided $1 million for the Charles Hayes Family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish and operate the Small Business Development Center at Malcolm X College . It is Smith who fought for and secured $4 million for Vision House , the facility that serves AIDS patients and their families . <p> *It is Smith who has given voters the most compelling reason to support her . Her opponent has repeatedly misrepresented her outstanding record and distorted the facts of a career dedicated to public service . Although her opponent is critical of " the long tradition of machine politics , " he has not rejected the involvement or contribution of several well-known machine representatives working on his campaign . <p> I strongly encourage voters of the 3rd Senate District to place their trust and their vote with a proven leader  --  state Sen. Margaret Smith . <p> Charles M. Ford , president , <p> St. Paul Church of God <p> in Christ , Community Development Ministries <p> In Steve Neal 's column , March 2 he says , " Black ministers in the district are being pressured to support Shaw as a younger candidate with vision . " His comment suggests that black ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This analysis is flawed because it suggests that black ministers are not capable of making an independent assessment and decision about the best representative for a political district for a given point in time . <p> The average black pastor does not hold or seek to hold any political office ; but provides a platform for candidates and elected officials to present his or her case before the people . Therefore , there is no way that a local politician can assure a black pastor to support any candidate or any issue . Also note that the power of the black church is in the hands of the people who fill the pews each week . <p> It is important that Neal understands that the black church still remains the one free institution in the black community . He need not agree with our political positions , but he does n't have the right to suggest that our decisions are the result of pressure . <p> For the record , our support of Father Martini Shaw is based on our belief that he is the best representative for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment , the conviction and the heart of a true servant . <p> Rev. Clay Evans , president , <p> Concerned Clergy for a Better Chicago , and committee members <p> When we watch the news and see the respect and honor given to the dead military men and women being returned from the battle fields , many things come to mind . I no longer feel pride in the rituals . If it has meaning that is believable , it must mean that America cares only for its dead service people . For she shows a different side when it comes to the men and women who survive . <p> In good times and in lean times , America finds the billions upon billions that she requests for defense and a host of other things , but when it comes to caring for the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect the nation and its worldwide interests , America becomes a miser . Veterans have to march and demonstrate to get the attention of the government . <p> While we are rushing troops to hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war to even more locations , we are closing veterans hospitals and increasing the co-payments for drugs and doctor visits . It is pitiful to see the veterans waiting long hours in crowded waiting rooms . <p> There is something amiss when the cost of veterans affairs fails to be considered when the cost of war is calculated . Were it not for the help given by private veterans organizations , the suffering would be even greater . American can and must do better in caring for her own . <p> Hollis Chester , <p> Greater Grand Crossing <p> The Enron debacle paints a picture of a company that thumbed its nose at the shareholders and employers it represented . <p> The refusal of the Bush administration to hand over the details of the Enron-influenced energy plan paints an uglier portrait still of a government that thumbs its nose at the very nation that employs it . <p> Lise M. Stevens , Edgewater <p> What 's the difference between a bribe and a corporate campaign contribution ? <p> Answer : Politics . <p> Karen Helsing , Brookfield <p> I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than placing the entire burden of reform on themselves by focusing on penalties for receiving . Pass laws that severely penalize recipients of contributions , rather than those who offer them . Perhaps if they were forced to repay any illicit funds and leave office in shame , they might learn to control the situation . <p> Phil Settecase , Willowbrook
