Prologue Nina Chickalini is no stranger to the tiny , windowless room just off the rectory of Most Precious Mother church on Ditmars Boulevard in Queens . It was here that she made her first-and last-confession to Father Hugh . Make that , the late Father Hugh . But that part-the late part - was n't her fault , no matter what Joey Materi said then ... and continues to say . Until that May weekday afternoon a decade ago , the parishioners of Most Precious Mother made their confessions in the blessed anonymity of the closet-like confessionals in the main church . But apparently , face-to-face confessions in a casual setting had become all the diocesan rage , and Nina 's pre-confirmation class was to be initiated into confessing their sins in the new-fangled way . Ordinarily , Danny Andonelli would have gone first . But he had caught a nasty throwing-up kind of flu from his little brother - or so he said . Nina suspected he was loathe to confess his failure to Keep Holy the Sabbath Day-he 'd been caught throwing water balloons at passing subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent that day , leaving Nina alphabetically next in line to make her first confession . She sat on the folding wooden chair opposite the kindly old priest , took a deep breath and forced herself to look him in the eye . " Bless me , Father , for I have sinned , " she began , as Sister Mary Agnes had taught them to do in CCD . He nodded encouragingly . But Nina noticed that he seemed a bit pale and distracted as she launched into a detailed account of her sins : cheating on a social studies test ( but not really , because she had glimpsed Andy O'Hara 's paper merely by accident ) ; taking the name of the Lord in vain ( which she could n't really help doing because she had dropped Grandma Valerio 's massive hardcover bible on her fragile pinky toe ) ; coveting her friend Minnie Scaturro 's brand-new canopy bed - Suddenly , the priest keeled over , clutching his chest . " Father Hugh ? " He writhed on the floor , gasping . For a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a pretty decent sense of humor for someone who wore somber black from head to toe every day of his life . It turned out Father Hugh was n't kidding . Nina ran shrieking out into the rectory , where her pre-confirmation classmates were waiting to make their first confessions . As Sister Agnes rushed to call 911 , Joey Materi said , " Holy shit , Nina , you must 've confessed one hell of a sin ! " That remark was miraculously overheard by the distracted and nearly-deaf Sister Agnes , resulting in an unpleasant penance for Joey , who had his mouth washed out with soap . Nina never did receive any penance for her curtailed first confession . And Most Precious Mother promptly went back to using the confessionals - which is why Nina has n't set foot in this tiny room since . Now , on a rainy Saturday June afternoon , the first thing she notices is that it looks exactly the same-pea-green indoor-outdoor carpeting , beige-painted cinderblock walls , a couple of wooden folding chairs , and a giant wooden crucifix as the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mildew , mothballs and musty hymnals . The next thing she notices is that unlike the room , Joey Materi - whom she has seen practically every day of her life-looks startlingly different . It is n't just that his dark hair is slicked back from his handsome face , or that he 's wearing a black tuxedo instead of his usual jeans and flannel shirt . The thing is , he suddenly looks like ... well , like a man . The tux makes his shoulders appear broader than usual , his lean frame taller than usual . His dark eyes bear an uncharacteristically solemn expression as he stares off into space , and his full lower lip is pensively caught beneath a top row of even white teeth . The devilish , jocular Joey Nina has known all her life is gone , replaced by this - this man . This ... Joe . Nina takes a step closer to him , her periwinkle taffeta skirt rustling around her dyed-to-match satin pumps . She can hear faint organ music coming from the adjacent church , which is packed with expectant friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millicent Milagros to stop playing The Wedding March , but she 's just launched into yet another round . Nina closes the door behind her , shutting out the music and instantly becoming aware that Joey does n't just look different - he smells different , too . Not that she is prone to sniffing Joey Materi . But she senses that if she were , he would n't normally smell so ... yummy . She can smell the white carnation that 's pinned to his lapel , a scent that reminds her of the Easter Sunday corsages her father used to buy for her . She can also smell a tantalizingly musky , citrus scent . " Are you wearing aftershave or something ? " she asks incredulously . Joey looks up , startled , as if he 's just noticed her . " What the heck are you doing back here , Nina ? " Oh . That . She takes a deep breath , forgetting all about the cologne . " I have something to tell you , " she says , trying not to sound overly ominous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to work on the ominous thing . Then again , why beat around the bush ? " Nobody 's dead , Joey ... " " Thank God . " " It 's worse . " " Worse than dead ? What can be worse than dead ? And why are you telling me this now ? I 'm getting married any second . " He checks the gold wristwatch he borrowed from his older brother , Phil . Phil , who is currently shirking his best manly duties , the lousy coward . In Nina 's opinion , Phil 's the one who should be doing this . Not her . The maid of honor is supposed to tend to the bride , not the groom . Then again , the bride must be halfway to the Port Authority right about now . Meanwhile , Phil is suddenly nowhere to be found , the other groomsmen are useless in the wake of last night 's rousing bachelor party , and the stricken bridesmaids are dabbing mascara-tinted tears from their cheeks in the ladies ' room . Which leaves only Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She puts a hand on his arm . " Joey ... you 'd better sit down . " " Nina , what the he - " He glances at the crucifix - " heck is going on ? " " Sit ! " She gives him a little shove toward the folding chair . He sits . " Nina , why are you - " He breaks off , and then an uh-oh expression dawns . " Where 's Minnie ? " " She 's ... gone . " Joey gasps -a sound not unlike Father Hugh 's last tortured breath . " I 'm sorry , Joey , " Nina says , swallowing hard over a lump in her throat . " What do you mean , ' gone ' ? " " She 's left town . " The look on his face tells her he does n't get it . She 'd better be more specific . " She 's left ... um , you . " " She 's left me ? But - " " I 'm so sorry . " " This ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry , Joey , " she says again , patting his muscular arm . She ca n't leave me ... The same haunting words were spoken by Nina 's father just last summer , about her mother Rosemarie . She ca n't leave me ... But Mommy is gone , too . Just like Minnie Scaturro . And Nina is left behind once again to pick up the pieces . " Where did she go ? " Joey asks miserably . Nina sighs , forcing away the image of her mother lying eerily still in that hospital bed . " Minnie said she wants to find - " " Wait , let me guess . To find herself ? Is n't that why people get jilted ? Because the other person wants to find herself ? " " I do n't think it 's herself that Minnie 's going to find , Joey . " " Then who is she going to find ? " " God , " Nina says flatly . " She said she 's going to find God . " Joey looks at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , gesturing at the crucifix . " I mean , this is a church , for Christ 's sake . Where does she think - " " She said she got the calling , Joey , " Nina blurts . " The calling ? " " The calling . " " She got the calling now ? " " No . Last night . " " Last night , " he repeated . " Last night , while I was out turning down lap dances and watching Danny puke all over the limo because he drank too many Jell-O shots , Minnie was getting the calling ? Is that what you 're telling me ? " Nina nods sympathetically . " I 'm so - " " Sorry ? " he cuts in . " You said that , Neens . A few times . " " I do n't know what else to say . " " I do n't , either . " He shakes his head , tears in his eyes . " I love her , Nina . You know that ? I 've loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made was built around marrying her . " " I know , Joey . I know . " She holds him close while his heart shatters into a million pieces , wishing she were anywhere but here . Wishing she were the one on the number seven train heading for a new whole life . For the first time since the canopy bed , Nina finds herself envying Minnie Scaturro , who , instead of settling for a boring life as boring Joey 's boring wife , gets to leave Queens behind at last . Any day now , I 'll be outta here , too , Nina consoles herself as Joey 's tears soak her taffeta-covered shoulder . Any day now ... ( Continues ... )
