Rehabilitation counselor education ( RCE ) students from one RCE program in the Southeastern region of the United States were surveyed in 1993 and 2003 to determine their career goals and if career goals changed a decade later . Other goals were to assess influencing factors for entering rehabilitation counseling or rehabilitation related professions and for selecting this RCE program . This is a partial replication study of Emener , Tannenbaum , and Cady ( 1990 ) and Dixon , Emener , Kelley , and Wright ( 1999 ) . Implications for marketing the rehabilitation counseling profession and RCE programs were provided including offering curricula that supports specialization , specialty certifications , and counselor licensure . <p> For rehabilitation counselor education ( RCE ) programs to remain relevant , viable , and attractive to students they must prepare students to enter a lifelong profession that has career options . The counseling profession , including rehabilitation counseling , is continually evolving and changing . As Emener , Evans , Lowe , and Richard ( 2001 ) pointed out , " over the past five decades , the one constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phenomenon of change " ( p.244 ) . In recent years changes in the counseling profession have been influenced by many factors including managed care , third-party reimbursement systems , counselor licensure legislation , and an increasing number of counselors going into private counseling practice . Rehabilitation counseling has been influenced by these same factors along with changes related to disability insurance and policy , technology , and increasing career options . It is an important ongoing task for RCE programs to periodically assess students ' career goals if they want to remain current with changes in the field and provide attractive educational options for prospective students . In addition , as pointed out by Goodwin ( 1986 ) ; Brodwin , Carlos , Orange , and Myers ( 1994 ) ; and Wilson , Rollins , and Doughty ( 2000 ) , it is necessary to develop marketing and recruitment strategies for RCE programs as well as the rehabilitation counseling profession . <p> Most RCE students go to work in a specialty area within the counseling and rehabilitation fields ( Goodwin , 1992 ) . This was supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of South Florida ( USF ) conducted by Emener , Tannenbaum , and Cady ( 1990 ) and Dixon , Emener , Kelley , and Wright ( 1999 ) . In the Emener et al . study , 79.8% of graduate students reported having a specific career goal upon entering the USF RCE program . In a replicated study by Dixon et al . nine years later at the same USF RCE program , 85.9% of entering students had a specific career goal . " Addiction counselor " and " mental health counselor " in the Emener et al . study and the reverse order in the Dixon et al . study were the most frequently cited career goals . In addition , most students maintained their career goals throughout their RCE programs . This included 75.9% of students in the Emener et al . study and 73% in the Dixon et al . study . A follow-up study by Kelley , Dixon , Emener , and Wright ( 1999 ) of graduates of the USF RCE reported that 60% of recent graduates ( 1987-1997 ) and 39% of remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The reasons students selected a RCE program to achieve their career goals were varied . Some individuals ' selection of a RCE program and rehabilitation counseling as a career choice was influenced by a personal experience with disability or having a close family member or friend with a disability ( Emener et al. , 1990 ; Glover-Graf &; Janikowski , 2001 ) . Students ' choice of a RCE program was also influenced by the characteristics of the RCE program . Some of the highest ranking features reported by RCE students in a study by Crimando , Sanders-Henry , and Chandler ( 1988 ) were " academic reputation of the program " , " curricula offerings " , " job opportunities in the field " , and " professional reputation of the faculty " ( p. 68 ) . Another study of RCE students by Dixon et al . ( 1999 ) reported " other " program factors such as flexibility of curriculum , location , and availability of evening classes as influential in selecting a RCE program . An additional factor appeared to be an individual 's past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Dixon et al. ) , because most of these RCE students were currently working or had past work experience in human service settings . <p> The purposes of this study were : ( 1 ) to determine students ' career goals and whether their career goals changed as a result of the changes in the counseling and rehabilitation fields in the past decade , ( 2 ) to assess the influencing factors for students ' entering rehabilitation counseling or rehabilitation-related professions , and the influential factors for selecting this southeastern university to achieve their career goals between 1993 and 2003 . Method <p> Participants <p> Eighty students in 1992-1993 and 53 students in 2003 for a total of 133 graduate students from a southeastern university were contacted during class and asked to voluntarily participate in this study . All agreed to participate resulting in a 100% response rate for both surveys . None of the surveys were considered unusable . <p> Materials <p> The Career Goal Survey utilized in this study was a modification of the Career Goal Survey developed for the Emener et al . ( 1990 ) study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . These studies investigated the career goal aspirations , career development factors , and influential factors for entering the RCE program at the University of South Florida ( USF ) in 1990 and 1999 . Because this southeastern university rehabilitation department is different from the USF RCE program in that it offers masters ' degrees in rehabilitation counseling ( RC ) , substance abuse and clinical counseling ( SACC ; Goodwin &; Lotterhos , 1991 ) , and vocational evaluation ( VE ; Thomas &; Sigmon , 1989 ) instead of the single degree in rehabilitation counseling offered at USF , questions were included that addressed initial program interest , personal experience with substance abuse , and other questions related to the three programs . Modifications were also made to the survey based on differences in certification and licensure credentials in this state versus Florida . Also , questions were added to ascertain the substance abuse histories of students and their families because this program has a large substance abuse and clinical counseling master 's degree program that the majority of students combine with the rehabilitation counseling degree . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Rehabilitation Studies in Fall 1992 and Spring 1993 . For clarity of reference throughout the remainder of this study , the 1992-1993 data collection will be referred to as the 1993 survey . A second survey was administered to graduate students a decade later in the Fall 2003 semester . The second survey was modified based on responses from the 1993 survey , a current literature review , and Dixon et al . ' s suggestion that future studies assess the influence of students ' personal and historical experiences on their career goals . <p> Sampling Procedure <p> The authors visited classes with RCE graduate students and asked students to voluntarily and anonymously complete the Career Goal Survey in both 1993 and 2003 . In 2003 , students who did not attend the classes surveyed were sent an e-mail and a letter with a stamped self-addressed envelope requesting their participation . Three students were contacted by e-mail and one of these students was also contacted via mail . Upon receipt of the surveys a tracking procedure was implemented to insure confidentiality of responses . <p> Data Analyses <p> Measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data . Data collected from the 1993 sample was compared to the data from the 2003 sample as well as data from the Emener et al . ( 1990 ) and Dixon et al . ( 1999 ) studies . Results and Discussion <p> Student Demographics <p> Table 1 provides a comparison of demographic data between USF and this southeastern university during the years of the studies . The majority of students in the studies were female with the mean age of the students at this southeastern university younger than in the Emener et al . ( 1990 ) and Dixon et al . ( 1999 ) studies . Both universities had a substantial number of older nontraditional students in their graduate RCE programs . Racial and ethnic origins were more varied in the earlier studies at both this university and USF ( Emener et al. ) and showed a decline in enrollment of African American students ( Dixon et al. ) in the later studies at both universities . <p> Disability . About the same percentage of students reported having a disability in 1993 as in 2003 ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical except for one student who reported being a recovering addict . In 2003 two people indicated mental illness , one indicated substance abuse and depression , one addiction , and two students reported a physical disability . These results are similar to the Emener et al . ( 1990 ) and Dixon et al . ( 1999 ) studies at USE A study of 186 rehabilitation students in undergraduate ( 18.8% ) , master 's level ( 76.9% ) , and doctoral programs ( 1.6% ) by Glover-Graf and Janikowski ( 2001 ) found that about 16.1% of students reported having a disability . In another study of 231 RCE master 's degree students in eight RCE programs by Glover-Graf , Janikowski , and Handley ( 2003 ) 24.7% reported having a disability . Also , the Council on Rehabilitation Education ( CORE , 2004 ) , who tracked enrollment data of RCE students , reported that of 4,012 students enrolled in CORE accredited programs in the 2002-03 academic year , 8.4% reported having disabilities . In this study 32.1% percent reported they had a family member and 5.7% reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disability in 2003 ( not asked in 1993 ) . In 1993 16.3% and in 2003 5.7% reported they were a client of the state-federal Division of Rehabilitation Services . <p> Previous history of substance abuse or addiction . Table 2 provides information regarding the students ' previous substance abuse problem or addiction history . Nicotine and caffeine were excluded from the past history of substance abuse in a separate question in the 2003 survey , resulting in a significant decrease in reported substance abuse usage . Students in 1993 and 2003 reported the same top four substances as previously abused cigarettes ( i.e. nicotine ) , caffeine , alcohol , and marijuana . The rank orders differed in 1993 and 2003 for the remaining three substances - sedative-hypnotics ( e.g. , tranquilizers , barbiturates ) , cocaine , and hallucinogens . In 1993 the average " clean time " ( i.e. , time without alcohol abuse ) was over 5 years ( 60.9 months ) for entering students . Insufficient data was available for 2003 . Codependency was the most frequently reported related addiction in 1993 and in 2003 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As shown in Table 2 there was a history of substance abuse in the students family-of-origin . The father was the most affected family member followed by the mother and brother in the 1993 survey . This question was not asked in the 2003 survey . Some students reported that a stepfamily member ( 13.2% ) or a friend ( 71.7% ) had a history of an alcohol or other drug abuse problem in the 2003 survey . <p> Work experience . There was an increase in the percent of students who had previous work experience in the human services field between 1993 ( 58.8% ) and 2003 ( 77.4% ) . The increase in 2003 may relate to the need for graduate education to pursue counselor licensure in order to either attain or maintain employment in the mental health and substance abuse fields . In recent years in this state there has been a dramatic shift in the substance abuse and mental health fields as well as the state-federal rehabilitation agency toward a more professional work force requiring or preferring licensed or certified counselors with graduate degrees in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credentialed professional work force was spurred on by the recent increased influence of managed care , third-party reimbursers , counselor licensure , and the privatization of the public mental health and substance abuse agencies in this state . The recent federal mandate to employ only qualified rehabilitation counselors with appropriate graduate degrees in rehabilitation counseling or a closely related area who are eligible for the certification in rehabilitation counseling ( Certified Rehabilitation Counselor CRC ) in the state-federal rehabilitation agency was another influential factor for returning to school for some entering RCE students . Career Goal Aspirations <p> A majority of students ( 82.5% in 1993 and 90.6% in 2003 ) reported having a specific career goal upon entering the Department of Rehabilitation Studies . Most entering students wanted to specialize in some area of counseling or rehabilitation . This was similar to the Emener et al . study ( 1990 ) and Dixon et al . study ( 1999 ) at USF that also reported a majority of students ( 79.8% and 85.9% respectively ) having a specific career goal upon entering the RCE program . <p> Specialization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the professional rehabilitation literature for many years by numerous rehabilitation counseling professionals including Patterson ( 1957,1967 ) , Wright ( 1980 ) , Kuehn , Crystal , and Ursprung ( 1988 ) , and Goodwin ( 1992 ) . As Goodwin pointed out , " the reality of present day rehabilitation counseling practice is that the vast majority of rehabilitation counselors specialize " ( p.5 ) by work settings ( e.g. , drug rehabilitation program ) , types of disabilities ( e.g. , psychiatric ) , an aspect of the rehabilitation process ( e.g. , vocational evaluation ) , or rehabilitation education and research . Even in state-federal rehabilitation agencies many rehabilitation counselors had specialty caseloads ( e.g. , school caseload , mental health ) . This study along with studies from Ugland , Coffey &; Menz ( 1985 ) , Emener et al . ( 1990 ) , Dixon et al . ( 1999 ) , and Kelley et al . ( 1999 ) indicated that for at least 27 years the vast majority of rehabilitation counselors specialized in some aspect of rehabilitation or counseling , usually under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse counselor , mental health counselor , vocational evaluator , case manager ) after earning their master 's degree in rehabilitation counseling . <p> Specific career goals . As seen in Table 3 , the first preference for career goals stated in both the 1993 and the 2003 survey was substance abuse counselor . In 1993 no related career goal was mentioned in the top four career choices ; however , in 2003 substance abuse counselor was followed by private for profit clinical mental health and substance abuse counselor , then mental health counselor tied with state-federal rehabilitation agency counselor . Emener et al . ' s ( 1990 ) study also cited " addiction counselor " and " mental health counselor " as did Dixon et al. , ( 1999 ) although the order was reversed in the later study . The trend toward mental health counseling in both public and private counseling practice probably reflected the development of state counselor licensure legislation ( i.e. LPC in this state and LMHC in Florida ) that opened up more career options in the mental health field for graduates of RCE programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When asked if their career goals had changed since entering the program , 76.3% of students in 1993 and 79.2% in 2003 reported " no " . This was similar to the 75.9% of students in the Emener et al . ( 1990 ) study and the 73% in the Dixon et al . ( 1999 ) study that reported they did not change their career goal while attending the RCE program . Of the 23.8% of students who indicated a change in career goal after entering the department in 1993 the majority ( 10% of the total sample ) reported that substance abuse counselor best identified their changed career goal . " Addictions counselor " and " mental health counselor " were reported as the changed career goal in the Emener et al . study and " mental health counselor " in the Dixon et al . study . <p> Degree programs students enrolled . At this university almost all students completed two of the three master 's degree programs combining the SACC or VE programs with the RC program . Rehabilitation counseling provided the core curriculum for all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 88.6% in 2003 ) one of the degree programs in which students enrolled in the department . The majority of students combined the SACC program with the RC program in both 1993 ( 48.8% ) and 2003 ( 66% ) . In 1993 the next most frequent combination was the combination of the RC program and the VE program ( 30% ) followed by students who enrolled in only in the SACC or RC program ( 6.3% each ) . In 2003 the second most frequently chosen program was the SACC or the RC program only ( 11.3% each ) followed by the combination of the RC program and the VE program . Only three students ( 3.8% ) enrolled in all three programs in 1993 and one ( 1.9% ) in 2003 . <p> Primary degree program sought by entering students . When asked to select the primary program they were seeking when they initially applied to the department , the majority of entering students in both 1993 ( 43.8% ) and 2003 ( 58.5% ) wanted the SACC program followed by the RC program ( 35% in 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program was the VE program ( 12.5% in 1993 and 3.8% in 2003 ) . <p> Licensure and certification goals after graduation . When asked what licenses and certifications students planned on seeking following graduation , the CRC ( 47.5% ) credential was ranked highest followed by the Certified Substance Abuse Counselor ( CSAC , 26.3% ) credential and Certified Vocational Evaluator ( CVE , 18.8% ) credential in 1993 . Following passage of the Licensed Professional Counselor ( LPC ) credential in 1994 the number one ranked credential students planned on earning after graduation had changed from the CRC ( 75.5% ) to the LPC ( 83% ) in the 2003 survey , followed by the Certified Clinical Addiction Specialist ( CCAS ; 39.6% ) credential . The three most frequently reported licenses and certifications in the USF studies by Emener et al . ( 1990 ) and Dixon et al . ( 1999 ) were very similar to this study with Licensed Mental Health Counselor ( LMHC ; 43.1% ) , Certified Addictions Professional ( CAP ; 23.3% ) , and CRC ( 18.6% ) as the most preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 44.5% ) , LMHC ( 41.2% ) , and CAP ( 7.6% ) the preferred credentials in the Dixon et al . study . In this state , the CRC is one of the accepted exams for the LPC credential and might be one of the reasons a higher percentage of students still planned on earning the CRC credential in 2003 as compared to the lower ranking of the CRC in the USF studies . With counselor licensure being the most sought after credential by students the implications for the RCE curriculum in terms of making sure graduates have the opportunity to take courses that meet the counselor licensure criteria are clear . <p> Influential factors for selecting the Department of Rehabilitation Studies . In both the 1993 and 2003 surveys the top reason students were attracted to the rehabilitation department was " job opportunities in the field " , which in 1993 was tied with the availability of the specialty " programs options " of SACC and VE that could be taken along with the RC program . " Program options " was tied with " curriculum offerings " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offerings " was the third reason in 1993 followed by " academic reputation of the program(s) " , " location " , and " convenience of course offerings " . In 2003 " desire for licensure " and " professional reputation of faculty " were added to the survey . " Desire for licensure " ranked third , " convenient geographic location " ranked fourth , " professional reputation of faculty " tied with " program reputation " for fifth , and " convenience of course offerings ( e.g. , night classes ) " was sixth in 2003 . In the 2003 survey the question related to influential factors for selecting the rehabilitation department was modified to include items relating to reasons for entering the rehabilitation counseling profession . " Desire to help others " and " personal growth experience " were ranked as the highest overall reasons for entering the department in 2003 . Eliminating these two items , which are more reasons for entering the profession of rehabilitation counseling versus the department , and licensure , which occurred after the 1993 survey , the top ranked influential factors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey . <p> Many of the reported reasons for entering the program were similar in the USF RCE ( Dixon et al. , 1999 ) study where students indicated that " other " factors such as program and curriculum issues , mental health licensure , desire to help , and personal growth had the most influence . Additionally , Crimando et al . ( 1988 ) indicated that " academic reputation of the program , " " curriculum offerings , " " job opportunities in the field , " and " professional reputation of the faculty " were the highest rated features . The reported reasons were not , however , similar to the Emener et al . ( 1990 ) study that reported the top motivating or influential factors for entering the USF program as " Convenience ( e.g. , including where and when courses were offered ) and personal experience ( e.g. , including the fact that they or a family member have a disability ) " ( pg . 129 ) . <p> Personal experience with disability . A surprising finding in this study is that experience with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a history of substance abuse and recovery , was the lowest ranked factors influencing students entering the rehabilitation department when compared to the personal growth , career , and academic factors . In the Emener et al . ( 1990 ) and Glover-Graf and Janikowski ( 2001 ) studies rehabilitation students reported that personal experience with disability was an influencing factor to enter a RCE program or to become a rehabilitation counselor . <p> These results were surprising because during student applicant interviews when students were asked why they were interested in pursuing a graduate degree in the rehabilitation department , many students indicated that a personal experience with a disability , usually substance abuse , influenced their decision to enter the rehabilitation department . These applicants who became students in 2003 often either had a disability ( 11.3% ) , had a family member ( 32.1% ) or a stepfamily member ( 5.7% ) with a disability or had a personal history of substance abuse and recovery ( 18.9% , excluding nicotine and caffeine ) , or had a family-of-origin member ( 67.9% ) , stepfamily member ( 13.2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a substance abuse problem . Yet , only one student reported her husband 's alcoholism as an influential factor for entering the rehabilitation department in the 2003 survey . <p> The reason the personal experience with disability factor was ranked at the bottom in this study might be because the survey question specifically asked , " What were the primary motivating or influential factors associated with your coming into the Department of Rehabilitation Studies ? " The question did not ask for their reasons for entering the profession of rehabilitation counseling . The Glover-Graf and Janikowski ( 2001 ) survey question asked rehabilitation students if their disability or disabilities of family or friends influenced their career decision to become a rehabilitation counselor versus entering a specific RCE program . This might account for the differences between studies and deserves further study . It is recommended that questions related to reasons for entering the profession of rehabilitation counseling be separate from reasons for entering a RCE program in survey instruments in future studies . Conclusions and Recommendations <p> This partial replication study generally agreed with the career goal research at USF by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al . ( 1999 ) . Although there were a number of findings of interest to rehabilitation counselor educators related to career goals in this study there were two findings related to rehabilitation counselor specialization and counselor licensure that stand out as especially important as they relate to RCE curriculum and marketing issues . <p> Rehabilitation Counselor Specialization <p> In this and the USF programs , the majority of students indicated they had a specific career goal that included a specialized area of rehabilitation or counseling upon entering their graduate degree RCE programs . For most students these career goals were consistent throughout their program of study . Substance abuse counseling was the " most preferred " career goal at this southeastern university for 1993 and 2003 and addictions and mental health counseling were most preferred in both the Emener et al . ( 1990 ) and Dixon et al . ( 1999 ) studies . Dr. Amos Sales ( personal communication , February 19 , 2005 ) Keynote Address to the National Council on Rehabilitation Education conference gave support to rehabilitation counseling being a specialized area of counseling . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8/14/04 that suggested that rehabilitation counseling is a specialty of counseling and CACREP wanted to work with CORE to develop one accrediting body ( CORE , 2005a ) . <p> In a study by Kelley et al . ( 1999 ) the majority ( 60% ) of USF RCE graduates from 1987 to 1997 attained their career goals , and 86% were highly satisfied with the preparation they received from the RCE program . Also , informal follow-up information of rehabilitation department graduates from this program indicated that most were employed in their preferred career and work setting . It would appear from this study and the Emener et al . and Dixon et al . studies at USF that specialty options may offer additional ways to recruit students . <p> One recommendation from this study is that RCE programs periodically conduct similar surveys of students to determine student career goals and desired credentials in their states . Based on these results , the number one reason reported by students for entering this rehabilitation department was because of its specialty options . For a specialty concentration and certificate to have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses should meet the academic criteria for state or national certification requirements for that specialty area . As a result of the state-federal rehabilitation agency 's Comprehensive System of Personnel Development initiative to upgrade their rehabilitation counselors to master 's degree level professionals eligible for the CRC credential , a specialty concentration in rehabilitation counseling for counselors with a related degree or students in a related mental health discipline can be offered . Specialty concentrations ( substance abuse counseling , employee assistance program counseling , and vocational evaluation ) in addition to multiple rehabilitation counseling related master 's degree make available educational opportunities that help meet the varied career goal interests of RCE students and other professionals in the community . RCE programs could offer concentrations appropriate to their employment market . <p> Further Dr. Amos Sales ( personal communication , February 19 , 2005 ) reported that CORE standards now recommend that we " understand " substance abuse ( CORE , 2005b ) . To assist in this understanding RCE programs might want to consider developing specialty concentrations in the area of substance abuse and in rehabilitation counseling . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will allow qualified people seeking the national CRC credential or the state substance abuse counseling certification to meet the academic criteria through distance education . This , too , would market the rehabilitation counseling profession and the RCE program offering the specialty concentration . <p> Another recommendation is for RCE programs to have rehabilitation counselor educators with specialty experience and credentials in the department to teach specialty courses in substance abuse counseling ( Emener et al. , 2001 ) , mental health counseling , private-for-profit insurance sector rehabilitation counseling , and vocational evaluation . For the educational program to have credibility with direct service providers , including employers in these specialized fields , qualified and credentialed faculty in their specialty areas are essential to teach these specialty courses and mentor students . This would help to address the decline in rehabilitation counselor educators with specialty expertise reported by Ebener ( 2004 ) . <p> Counselor Licensure <p> The second finding of importance to rehabilitation counselor educators has to do with the impact of counselor licensure on the credentials students plan on seeking and their career goals . Students want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they successfully complete the RCE program . The number one ranked credential students planned on earning after graduation changed from the CRC in 1993 to the LPC in 2003 following implementation of the LPC in 1994 . Although substance abuse counseling remained the number one career goal in both 1993 and 2003 , mental health counselor was the second ranked career goal in the 2003 survey . Mental health counselor was much lower on the list in 1993 before the passage of the LPC . The option of private-for-profit clinical mental health and substance abuse counseling as a career goal was not considered in 1993 . The LPC credential was followed by the CRC and CCAS in 2003 . The same three credentials ( i.e. CRC , LMHC , CAP ) were also the most frequently reported by students in the USF studies by Emener et al. , ( 1990 ) and Dixon et al. , ( 1999 ) . The implications for RCE curriculums is to make sure graduates have the opportunity to take courses that meet counselor licensure for the state in which they plan to become employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs could offer courses essential to their graduates for frequently pursued credentials , such as substance abuse counselor certification . <p> Marketing Implications <p> The findings from this study are helpful to rehabilitation counselor educators developing marketing and recruitment strategies for RCE programs as well as the professional discipline of rehabilitation counseling . It is recommended that rehabilitation counselor educators include and highlight information related to the availability of counselor licensure , specialty educational options and certifications , and job opportunities for graduates of their programs in any marketing efforts , along with the recommendations for marketing RCE programs offered by Rasch , Hollingsworth , Saxon , and Thomas ( 1984 ) ; Goodwin ( 1986 ) ; Brodwin et al . ( 1994 ) ; Wilson et al . ( 2000 ) ; and Reid , Reed , and Flores ( 2002 ) . Since the profession of rehabilitation counseling is still not very well known compared to other health and mental health disciplines RCE programs also need to market the rehabilitation counseling profession itself with materials ( e.g. , Goodwin , 1997a , 1997b , 1999 ) that also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study is that all students were from one RCE program . However , this was offset somewhat by comparing the results from the same program a decade earlier and two other similar studies of RCE students at USF around the same time frame conducted by Emener et al . ( 1990 ) and Dixon et al . ( 1999 ) . Results were also compared to relevant data from other studies , including CORE data . It is hoped that rehabilitation counselor educators will periodically evaluate their students ' career goals , curriculum , and employment after graduation . This information can then be used to improve their students ' career preparation , opportunities for specialty options and job performance . This will also enhance the reputation and visibility of the rehabilitation counseling profession as well as employers and individuals with disabilities .
