. and what your child 's name says about you . Gone are the days when most parents just called their child Ralph or Neil or Lisa or Ellen  --  something traditional or just a little trendy  --  and moved on . Sure , we wanted a name we liked , but we also wanted , in a way , to fit in . Nowadays , a perusal of any preschool 's class list suggests that more and more parents are after a name that stands out , that is actively , obviously different from other kids ' names . A name that 's cool . Time was , most kids were named what everyone else was named : for family members or saints , or following traditional ethnic or religious protocol . But that 's changed . A lot . How did we get here ? The cool-name movement began slowly and quietly around 1947 , when , for the first time in 67 years , Mary was knocked off the number one spot for girls ' most popular names ( by Linda ) . Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child has expanded considerably , and more and more the goal seems to be to find a name that 's different from other names . In recent years the trend has exploded , with parents looking to new sources for names , from surnames to word names , place names to nature names , to entirely invented choices . Of course " cool " has become a powerful force in our culture in various ways . Pregnancy , parenthood , babies , and kids can all have that aura  --  from baring our baby bumps and taking prenatal yogalates to dressing our babies in hip clothes . And certain baby names , many parents think , also say that they 're hip , that they have n't become stuffy or lost their sense of style just because they have a baby . An unusual quality is definitely one of the prime things that makes a name cool , with the ultimate being that elusive name that 's easy to like and understand but also somehow distinctive or even one-of-a-kind . Being an individual is carved into the American national consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , with celebrities like Oprah , Viggo , Beyonc , and Madonna leading the way . To a certain extent , by choosing names we think are just a bit outside the mainstream , we 're saying to our kids " Go , be yourself . " Yet finding such a name can be tough . As more babies are given less-common names , the what's-cool bar is raised ever higher and the name that seems cool today may be cold  --  or overheated  --  tomorrow . " My wife and I thought we were on to something original in naming our son Jaden , " says Dan Dement of his 6-month-old . " But now we find out that Will Smith , Andre Agassi , and Britney Spears have sons named Jaden , and we fear that lots more are on the way . " ( The Carlsbad , California , dad has got that right : 12,871 little fellows named Jaden and Jayden  --  Spears 's choice  --  will turn 2 this year , not counting the Jaidens and Jadons ... ) Names and baby-naming fashions are changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , first entered the Top 1000 just 13 years ago and has already catapulted to number 54 ; Jaden 's at 88 . Ethan has leaped up to number 5 in the same time period . And Nevaeh ( heaven backwards ) jumped all the way to number 70 in a mere five years . Contrast this with newcomers of the past , Jennifer and Karen , which took three decades to move up a few hundred places . Spelling variations , too , have become another way to give a name a tweak of originality . Example : Whereas 30 years ago there were no Kaylees in the Top 1000 girls ' names , in 2005 eight different spellings of it were given to around 11,000 little girls ( Kaylee , Kayleigh , Kayli , etc . ) . Stars have tremendous power to confer cool on a name , either by infusing it with their own glamorous image or by choosing it for their child . Reese Witherspoon , for instance , has inspired thousands of little Reeses , and by picking Ava for her own daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And celebrities like Demi Moore ( with daughters Rumer , Scout , and Tallulah ) and director Robert Rodriguez ( with sons Racer , Rebel , Rocket , and Rogue ) have elevated the art of cool baby-naming to new heights . As greater numbers of kids get unusual names , more types of distinctiveness become typical , and the stakes are raised . Thus we get girls named Seymour , boys named Romy , and children of either sex named anything from Peyton to Jordan to Justice . Ethnic distinctiveness is another earmark of this trend , with names from outside the typical American/European list becoming almost the norm , whether it 's the Irish Tristan or the African Ajani  --  and whether or not the family is of that culture . " My husband is of Iranian descent , and I chose my son 's name because it means " universe " in Farsi , " says Odette Faghani , the Santa Clara , California , mom of Kayvan , 2 . " I did like the cool factor , too , and since most people do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good conversation starter . " Some parents even believe material benefits will come to a carefully named child . " It was important to me that our kids ' names be perceived as cool because we want to give them every advantage in life , " says Charity Hand , the Hickory , North Carolina , mom of sons Thomson , 6 , and Chase , 1 , and daughter Taylor , 3 . " A name that 's cool just might be the name that gets more attention on a rsum someday . And we want friends to see them as cool because they 're extensions of our tastes and personalities . " But cool , by its very nature , is an ever-changing concept . Choosing a name that 's going to stay cool over your child 's entire lifetime may be impossible . Ethel and Maurice , for instance , along with Shirley , Debbie , and Caitlin , Ricky , Bobby , and Jason , were all cool names at one time . The only solution : maybe avoid cool entirely . " Kareem and Cosmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effortlessly cool husband picked for the boy half of the twins we were expecting , " says Marijane Funess of Pelham , New York . " Not wanting to hurt his feelings , I just asked him to consider how hard it can be for a kid with an " unusual " name . He thought about it and came up with Nicholas . Our son 's nine now , and even though there are probably a dozen Nicks in his school , the name seems to fit him to a tee , and we marvel at how names do become the person .
