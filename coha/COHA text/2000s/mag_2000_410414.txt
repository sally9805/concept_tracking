FOR FLEDGLING BUSINESSES , NOTHING 'S BETTER THAN A FREE SERVICE . SO WE TRIED SOME ONLINE Headnote WORKGROUP AND E-COMMERCE TOOLS THAT CLAIM TO HELP YOUR COMPANY FOR NADA. // " I CA N'T BELIEVE THEY 'RE GIVING THIS AWAY FOR FREE , " says John Ettema , owner of Inside-Out Home and Garden , a store in Campbell , California . He 's talking about ECongo , a free e-commerce hosting service that he used to add online sales to the business he does at his brickand-mortar shop . " If you had told me a year ago when I opened my store that I 'd be on the Web by now , I would have said you were crazy , " Ettema continues . The explosion of free services available on the Web-ranging from free storefronts like Ettema 's to free collaboration software that helps you stay in touch with coworkers and clients-has reduced the economic barrier to using the Internet for business down to , well , nothing . That 's good news for cash-strapped small businesses . Without investing in a network , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software , businesses can maintain group calendars , share files , and even collaborate in real time through chat or document review . Want to dive into e-commerce ? Free store-building tools include everything from catalog creators to virtual shopping carts , plus the hosting services you need to put your business on the Web . All you need is a Net connection . But do n't you have to pay the piper sometime ? That was the question we kept in mind as we sniffed through four online collaboration suites and a trio of free e-commerce services , as well as speaking to the small-business people who use them . We discovered that free services can only take you so far , but at least they do take you somewhere . Free Collaboration PETER LESHAW , who works for Enterprise Development Corporation , a nonprofit technology organization in Florida , spends far more time outside his office than in it . He , like the other experts who staff EDC , relies on HotOffice , an on-the-Web collaboration suite , to stay in touch . " HotOffice has trimmed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rather than calling the office for one of the administrative documents we all share , it 's easier to log in to HotOffice and access the documents there . " All this is possible without physically networking the organization 's machines . By letting users select a familiar browser as the interface , Web collaboration suites like HotOffice simplify operation . There 's no new software to learn , just Webbased forms to figure out . " A non-tech-savvy person can do great things with these tools , " says James Eron . As chief information officer for the U.S. Amateur Ballroom Dancing Association , Eron helped the group get connected via a free collaboration site using HotOffice . " One of the officers is not particularly computer literate , but she publishes more documents for sharing than almost anyone else , " he notes . To find out whether these tools are as wonderful as Leshaw and Eron claim , we looked at four of them : DayTracker , HotOffice , Schedule Online , and WebEx . And we discovered that they 're not all created equal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the Web with increasing frequency , they share some digital DNA . All , for instance , sport organizer-like tools , including at a minimum a scheduling calendar and an address book . Most also toss in a to-do list , discussion boards , and other features . HotOffice and Schedule Online even add synchronization with Microsoft Outlook or with handheld PalmPilots . In most instances , all or part of the workgroup can share these organizational tools . By setting up privileges , the administrator ( typically the first person who signs up for the service ) allows others to do such things as enter changes in the calendar or access an address book . The good collaboration tools , however , go beyond basic schedule sharing . Indeed , many businesspeople we talked to considered document sharing the most important feature of an online workgroup tool . By uploading files to a Web server , users publish documents that others can share by downloading to their computers . Of the sites we looked at , only DayTracker lacks this service . But HotOffice takes the document-sharing prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server-thereby ensuring that no hacker can intercept private and possibly business-crucial information-but it 's the only free service that permits users to search for documents by keyword . Another sophisticated tool is real-time file sharing , which enables several people to view and annotate documents simultaneously and even to share running applications like Word or PowerPoint . But of the four tools we reviewed , only WebEx provides its own real-time collaboration . THE PRICE YOU PAY OF COURSE , there 's no such a thing as a free lunch . Like a lot of other free services on the Web , some collaboration sites make their money by bombarding you with advertisements . HotOffice , for instance , sticks banner ads at the top of every page . If you love certain collaboration tools but do n't want to expose your employees to ads , you can buy ad-free versions of the software . Both HotOffice and Schedule Online offer such an arrangement . DayTracker carries no ads in the first place . WebEx takes a different approach by getting rid of ads and limiting the functionality you get for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of more than four people and collaborate for longer than lo minutes , WebEx will start charging . Photograph BIGSTEP 'S SMALL PRINT // Here 's a blow-by-blow account of the collaboration tools we used . DAYTRACKER.COM PROS Can create private client groups , easy to add anyone to the collaboration . CONS Lacks file sharing and ca n't support real-time collaboration . DayTracker does n't win the blue ribbon as a collaborative tool . Though it includes the basics-a group calendar , an address book , and message boards-it does n't let you share files , conduct chats , or provide Netstyle document or application collaboration . DayTracker 's most striking feature is its ability to segregate projects by " groups , " a term it uses to mean concept- or idea-specific content . You build groups for each project or client and then invite people to join a specific group . Basically , this group function is a slick privacy feature , separating information so Client A sees the calendar events , contacts , and discussions you want her to see , but not the content you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file sharing and chat , but neither does it bombard you with ads or slap any restrictions on how much data you can stick on its servers . Unfortunately , that could change . DayTracker.corn is being purchased by FranklinCovey , makers of the Franklin Planner line of paper-based organizers . At press time , Franklin had n't announced any changes , but group scheduling will probably remain DayTracker 's focus . www.daytracker.com HOTOFFICE PROS Provides a full suite of collaboration tools , includes excellent file-sharing features . CONS Maximum 40MB of free shared file storage . HotOffice recently unveiled its free Web service after years of honing a paid version of the software . So it 's no wonder that HotOffice is the most polished and feature-rich collaboration site of the four we looked at . It combines the most comprehensive set of tools-including Web-based e-mail , group scheduling , contact and document sharing , chat space , and threaded discussions-with an easy-to-use interface . File sharing may be HotOffice 's best feature . You can publish files for group consumption by uploading them to HotOffice and then adding descriptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're downloading . Another outstanding convenience : A search engine is available to help users dig up files by keyword . Users can either view those documents within the browserHotOffice converts them to HTML format on the fly-or download them for later review . But HotOffice has some negatives , too . One drawback is that you must explicitly define all users before they can join youthere is no virtual office or directory-like listing for customers to browse . A second ( and more frequent ) annoyance involves HotOffice 's tendency to bombard you with advertising . And finally the service limits the amount of free storage you get to 40 MB for your entire company ( you can , however , pay for extra storage at a rate of $2.50 per month for each additional 20MB ) . www.hotoffice.com * SCHEDULE ONLINE // ONE OF THE BEST THINGS about HotOffice Is the way it permits users to collaborate on documents and track revisions . // PROS Supports basic file sharing ; guests can view calendars without having to register with the service . CONS Forms for many tools are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service says everything you need to know about it . Though Schedule Online is stuffed with collaboration tools-just real-time document sharing and message boards are missing  --  only its online meeting and resource calendar is worthwhile . Schedule Online stresses its calendar , which can be shared by designated users and viewed by specified guests . The arrangement means you can give your customers access to the calendar by setting up guest accounts for them . They can then view the calendar without going through Schedule Online 's registration . The calendar offers other time-saving shortcuts too . To schedule a meeting , for instance , you click a time slot and enter the particulars . On the downside , many of Schedule Online 's other tools have crude forms or lack extras that some of the other free collaboration sites provide . For example , the site 's document publishing tool allows you to control file access , but it displays a bare-bones list of files on the server and wo n't let you rename the file or add descriptive text . www.scheduleonline.com WEBEX PROS Offers real-time application and document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes per session , users can meet with only three others at a time . Though WebEx does have online office options , with group calendar , an address book , and file sharing , its specialty is its stick virtual gatherings . At WebEx meetings-designed to accommodate up to four peopleparticipants can cooperatively view and annotate documents , exchange chat messages , give slide-style presentations , and run an application on one PC that shows up on the displays of the other attendees . Other services rely on downloads for sharing documents , but WebEx stresses dynamic meetings where everyone can contribute simultaneously . The person running the meeting loads a document , Web page , or application , and the other participants can view it on their monitors . At any time during the meeting , the host can transfer control to another attendee , enabling that person to display documents . Meanwhile , anyone who likes can type comments into the chat window available for that purpose . When you review documents in real time or share applications across WebEx , the response time-the amount of time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the speed ofyour Internet connection . But even when we used it over a standard 56kbps analog connection , WebEx continued to perform with spectacular speed . For most meetings , the free deal should suffice , but if you find that you need to meet with more than three others or if you expect to host an application-sharing session for longer than lo minutes , you must provide a credit card up front and pay 15 cents for each meeting minute ( a new fee structure should be out now ) . www.webex.com 101 . Free Storefronts " ORIGINALLY I went with a for-pay e-commerce service , " says Glenn McComber , a partner in Breaker Spot , a Sarasota , Florida , firm that sells alarm systems and other electrical products . I had to hire someone to develop the site , and it was always a problem getting across what I wanted . But within minutes I was setting up my own site on Bigstep . " Taking a small business onto the Web may generate extra income , but getting it there can give you headaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web storefronts like Yahoo Store and lCat may require a bigger financial commitment than fledgling operations are willing to make to go online . Free e-commerce services are one way to get your Web feet wet without exhausting your bank account . We tested Bigstep , ECongo , and FreeMerchant to see just how far zero dollars could take us in e-commerce . The answer is that they go as far as taking a customer 's credit card number . From there on , the costs add up . BUILD IT FOR FREE THE BEST THING about building a storefront with a free service like Bigstep , ECongo , or FreeMerchant is that you do n't have to know HTML . Like fee-based storefronts Yahoo Store and lCat , the freebies let you pick a design template , enter basic information , and set options like accepted methods of payment . If you 're assembling a retaillike storefront , you then create a catalog and fill it with descriptive text and digital images . The store 's underlying commerce features-the shopping cart , order forms , and tax and shipping calculations-are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from site traffic reports to assistants that register your site with several search engines . Each free e-commerce service shows its true colors in the details . Bigstep 's strong point , for instance , is its easy setup : A stepby-step wizard and a convenient checklist of to-do tasks lead you through store making . Freemerchant , meanwhile , excels at backoffice tasks : It 's the only free host that tracks inventory and lets you integrate your online store with QuickBooks , the small-business accounting program . ECongo does n't distinguish itself in any specific area . Though some fee-based e-store hosts limit the number of products you can put in your catalog or make you pay more to build a beefier online inventory , the services we looked at let you add all the items you want to your sales list . Bigstep does , however , limit each user 's image file storage space to 12MB . WHAT A DEAL ! WHAT 'S THE CATCH ? To make money on the deal , ECongo plans to sell small ads on its members ' sites . Bigstep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner with suppliers like OfficeMax . Though these services do n't charge a dime to put a store on the Web , they do impose some costs-specifically , credit card transaction fees . To process credit card orders , you have to pay to set up a merchant account ; there 's also a charge for each credit card transaction . Be sure to investigate each hosting service 's merchant account setup and transaction charges before you decide where to open shop . Prices range from Bigstep 's charges of $15 per month ( with no setup fee ) and 20 cents per transaction to FreeMerchant 's $399 software charge , $45 monthly fee , and 35-cent surcharge per transaction . Despite such costs , these services ' gratis storefront hosting , virtual shopping carts , and other complimentary tools are nothing to sneeze at . Again , consider all your options before diving in . BIGSTEP.COM PROS Outstanding step-by-step wizard for store creation . CONS Must use service 's merchant account for credit card orders . Bigstep.com is n't such a big step for small businesses eager to try out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bigstep walks you through site building , catalog creation , and report setup . And Bigstep breaks the process down into tasks and even includes a to-do checklist that tracks what you need to finish . That helps you parcel the job into small chunks you complete as time permits-a major selling point for people building their store on stolen time . Bigstep offers 28 design templates for customizing colors and font sizes ; you also get a shopping cart for customers to gather their selections and place orders . Finished sites can look as slick as any produced by a professional designer , and the range of options available allows your online presence to look quite different from other storefronts created with the same templates . But Bigstep 's biggest advantage is its suitability for both service- and productoriented businesses . While ECongo and FreeMerchant are basically online catalog generators , Bigstep 's designs can accommodate small businesses that sell services , rather than goods . Our biggest complaint-one we heard from several small businesses , as well-is that you must use Bigstep 's merchant account partner to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account costs are the lowest of the three we reviewed ( $15 per month plus transaction fees ) , but businesses that already have an account elsewhere wo n't want to pay for a second . The service 's other significant limitation-the 12MB maximum for storing image files-should n't create any problems for you unless you plan to post an enormous , picture-heavy catalog . ECONGO.COM PROS In-store search tool , lists your store in a mall-like directory . CONS Cookie-cutter look , wizard tool is of limited help . ECongo 's store maker is cruder than Bigstep 's , and the service lacks the back-office tools that make FreeMerchant appealing . ECongo does offer the core set of store-building and maintenance tools , including a shopping cart , access to a merchant account ( for $40 per month , plus transaction fees ) , and order processing . It features only six templates , which tend to generate online storefronts that look like cookie cutter copies . For instance , all ECongo storefronts share the same navigational toolbar at the top of the screen . What 's more , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front page with images and text can be daunting , since the store-making guide effectively leaves you on your own after the basic store is in place . Photograph WHEN YOU USE ECONGO to build an online store , the end result Is automatically placed in an online mail to help drive traffic to your front door . // On the other hand , ECongo does provide a couple of tools that the others omit . A built-in store search tool , for example , enables customers to jump directly to a product that they are interested in , rather than having to hunt through the entire store . And of the three services we examined , only ECongo collects its members in a business directory designed to drive traffic to your store . But these attractive perks are n't enough to sway us . We think you can find better help for your e-business than ECongo offers . FREEMERCHANT PROS Imports catalog information from spreadsheets and databases , integrates online ordering with QuickBooks for processing , no catalog size limit . CONS High credit card transaction fee , obtuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their existing operation will get more from FreeMerchant than from any other free host . It includes the necessary core of storebuilding tools and lets you stock an unlimited catalog on the Web , but its forte is how it lets users manage their online business . FreeMerchant is the only free store service that lets you import data from an existing database or spreadsheet to speed up catalog building . It accepts info from 1-2-3 , DBase , Excel , FoxPro , and Paradox . It 's also the only service that exports order invoices to QuickBooks . And it automatically posts items from your catalog to EBay , the giant online auction site . Creating your store at FreeMerchant seems unduly hard , however . The 50-plus templates offer color and background variations on a handful of layouts , and at times you 're left guessing about the next step to take . As a result , you 'll have to fiddle with the storefront layout to finesse it into shape . And FreeMerchant 's charge Of 30 cents per transaction for credit card authorization ( on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trio . FreeMerchant 's excellent management tools may be lost on an e-commerce neophyte , but if you want maximum functionality from your free storefront service , this site is your best bet . Sidebar Best Bets AMONG FREE COLLABORATION TOOLS , HotOffice is our favorite . Its wealth of features and its emphasis on document sharing make it ideal for any workgroup-despite its pox of advertisements . WebEx gets an honorable mention because , uniquely among free collaboration sites , it lets you conduct real-time virtual meetings in which everyone can share files or programs . If you want to build an online store for free , Bigstep.com offers the easiest way to get started selling online . Though we do n't like FreeMerchant as much , it 's well suited for companies that already have a catalog database and want to export data to QuickBooks .
