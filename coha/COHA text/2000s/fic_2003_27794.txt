THE YEAR OF ICE By BRIAN MALLOY ST . MARTIN 'S PRESS THE ABSOLUTE STILLNESS OF THE WHITE January 1978 Aunt Nora always says that people can still surprise you . I never got what she meant by that until last fall . I mean , Floyd Anderson always seemed normal enough . He 's an old Swede who has been our neighbor for as long as I can remember . He 's always had a good word for everybody . He always told the same jokes , always talked about the weather , and always kept his sidewalk clean as a whistle even during the worst snowfalls . You could set your watch by Floyd Anderson . Then he began wearing a pyramid on his head right around Halloween . He bought it at one of those hippie shops on the West Bank , where all the sixties burnouts live . They sell them in stores that are full of body oils and incense and rolling papers and bongs . Floyd 's pyramid 's not a hat ; it 's this kind of dumb-ass thing that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some weird shit like that . It was n't until a couple of weeks after he got it , when the thermometer dropped below zero , that he 'd put a hat on underneath it . I 'd watch him from my bedroom window , shoveling his walk , covered from head to toe against the windchill , the dull brass of the pyramid reflecting the winter sun . His wife left him about three weeks ago . They 'd been married almost forty years . Dad said , " Makes you think . " But he was wrong ; it did n't make me think . Not much does . I 'm not proud of it or anything , I 'm just telling the truth . When I see Floyd at Red Owl , where I bag groceries after school , he smiles at me and says , " You really have to get one of these . " He means his pyramid . " I feel psychically healed . It 'll bring you peace . " Floyd 's not lying . Rumor had it that he 'd wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think so , Mr. Anderson , " I always tell him . " You do n't know what you 're missing , " he says as he grabs his bag of Kellogg 's Corn Flakes and Del Monte pudding cups from me . " Do n't know what you 're missing , " he says again , like I had n't heard him the first time . Once he 's out the sliding doors , Lorraine , the checker who works with me at register three , says , " Is he seeing anyone , do you know ? " I look at her like she 's mental . " You mean Floyd Anderson ? " Yes , Floyd Anderson , she nods , showing me her black and gray roots . " You 're too good for him , " I tell her . She sighs and says under her breath , " Let me be the judge of who I 'm too good for , thank you very much . " Lorraine gave up on my dad around Labor Day . He kept telling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good-looking man and what they call in my biology class an endangered species : a single middle-aged man . He had to stop going to a Catholic support group for people whose spouses died ' cause the widows would n't leave him alone . They 'd call him at all hours , sometimes drunk , and once he stopped answering the phone , they 'd ask me for advice : " What does he like to do ? " " What 's his favorite meal ? " " Would he like to go to a Northstars game , do you think ? " I 'd just stare at the receiver , feeling a little sorry for these women who 'd been cheated out of a husband so early in life . Out of loyalty to my mom , who died in a car accident , I 'd tell them that Dad had a girlfriend and to stop calling our house . But they did n't , not until Dad broke down and paid the extra money for an unlisted number . When that happened , they started dropping by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down the basement or hide upstairs in his room anytime the doorbell rings . It 's my job to put the widows off his scent . A tot of them bring ties , something Dad does n't needhe works day shifts at the Highland Park Ford plantand I wonder if all these male presents used to belong to the dead husbands . " I never see your father at church anymore , " one of the widows said to me , a brightly wrapped box of cuff links in her shivering hands . I had Dad 's permission to say whatever I needed to to get rid of them . I told her , " He 's converting . " With her teeth chatteringI never let the widows insideshe asked : " To what ? " " Islam . " We were studying world religions during fourth-period history . The next time she showed up at the door , she was wearing one of those veil things over her face and had the Koran with her . Okay , so she did n't show up in a veil with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I kind of freaked her out with the Muslim stuff . But as Aunt Nora says , " Any story worth telling is worth exaggerating . " The smart widows bring something for me . One gave me a twenty-dollar gift certificate to Positively Fourth Street , a record store and head shop near the U. To these women I 'm polite , but no more encouraging . " He 's out on a date . " " He 's gone on a vacation with his girlfriend . " " He 's engaged . " Mom 's funeral had to be held on my sixteenth birthday . To compensate , Dad gave me a hundred bucks . I still have it stashed in my sock drawer , along with the money I make at Red Owl . I 've been thinking about Mom a lot lately ' cause the second anniversary is coming up . For example , I remember my first day back on the school bus after her funeral . A really weird girl , Laurie Lindstrom , tried to be nice to me . Laurie always read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been murdered when they were camping up on the north shore . A motorcycle gang beat them to death as part of some weird initiation for new members . It made the national news , and somebody wrote a book about it that 's being turned into a TV movie of the week . Far as I know , Laurie has n't gotten any money from it . She 'd sat next to me on the bus and said , " I know how hard it is to lose your mother . I got a postcard from mine two days after she died . " I tried to imagine what it must have said . Dear Laurie , Aiiiiiiiiiiiie ! Help us ! For the love of God , HELP US ! Love , Mom Or maybe : Dear Laurie , Daddy and I are being hacked to death by satanic bikers . Wish you were here . Love , Mom I told her , " Thanks . " " If you ever want to talk " " Thanks , " I told her again , my voice a NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do n't take the bus to school anymore . Tommy , my best friend since I was a little kid , got a ' 71 Dodge Challenger and picks me up every morning when he can get it started . It makes a blub-blub-blub sound and stalls out whenever he makes a right turn . Still , it 's very cool . Tommy and I belong to a clique that wears flannel shirts , smokes Camels , and goes to keggers every weekend . As members of the class of ' 78 , we 've already been counseled to go to vo-techs after we graduate this June so we can learn a trade . Tommy 's gon na be an auto mechanic ; I have n't decided what I 'm gon na do . Dad wants me to go to the Uthey have to take any idiot with a high school diploma of GED in the General College program . In four years I 'd graduate with a general degree and begin a general life . I told Dad that I 'd think about it , but last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young man . Do n't think you 're not going . " Dad hates his job ; he has for as long as I can remember . Some weeks he drank himself sick because he could n't face one more day at the plant . When he was drunk he 'd say , " That goddamn plant 's killing me . " He wants me to get an education so I can get a higher-paying job of my own to hate . Tommy says that General College is a waste of time , I should go to Dunwoody with him and become an electrician of draftsman of something . Or cooler yet , go to Brown Institute over on Lake Street and get a job in radio . We 're lined up at one end of Van Cleve Park waiting for the kickoff . Most Sundays we play Snow Football with some guys I guess you 'd call our friends . I 've dragged Tommy here every week for a month , even though he 'd rather be inside cranking tunes and smoking weed . " I du n no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got time . " Tommy tells me that he 's already applied to Dunwoody Institute . He 's making plans for his future , even if I 'm not . While we wait for the kickoff he pushes his long dirty blond hair behind his ears . He looks like one of the Allman Brothers , except with normal-colored skin . The ball flies at us and I catch it , but it 's frozen and slick and it pops out of my hands like a wet bar of soap . The challenge of snow football is possession ; that 's what makes it so much better than regular football . " Shit ! " Jon Thompson 's already made it down the field and snags the ball , bad news for my side . The good news is that I 'm six-two and weigh 185 pounds so it 's easy for me to knock him on his ass . On the way down I hug him hard ; Jon 's a fox . He 's got these really big eyelashes and hair that 's the same color as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jon . So I just lie there on top of him . This is like the only time I can get away with it without people shitting their pants . " Get off a me , " he says . " Okay , tough guy , " I tell him and I slap the side of his head . I do this for two reasons , really . First , ' cause if I smack him , nobody will guess that I want to pick him up in my arms and kiss him really hard , right on his lips . And second , he 's got to be reminded that I 'm tougher than he is . Wolves do this all the time to keep order in the pack . I 'm the alpha ; he 's the beta . That 's the way it always has been and that 's the way , uh-huh , uh-huh , I like it , uh-huh , uh-huh . If anybody knew I liked KC and The Sunshine Band I 'd have to drop out . We wait for the snap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na beat the crap outta you . " I shrug and say , " Nobody here . " Tommy looks around . " Nah , I guess not . But someday , somebody will . " Rick Foley falls back with the ball and I pound into Jon Thompson again . This time he does n't yell at me to get off him , he 's afraid to . He just waits quietly for me to get up . I smile and wink at him . He thinks I 'm being a jerk , but my wink is sincere . And it 's a thrill , maybe the only one I 'll ever get to have . Wherever Jon is on the field , I 'm soon on top of him . He feels like heaven underneath me . We do n't say a word to each other and he never looks me in the eye . It 's easy to pretend that he 's in my bed and that I 'm holding him . Tommy notices that I wo n't cut Jon a break . He says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I choose what . That night , alone in my bed , I pile up the pillows and hold them in my arms . Here , Jon Thompson 's in love with me , his head on my shoulder and my hand stroking his cool chocolate hair . I kiss the fabric of the pillowcase and squeeze Jon tighter . We talk about the game . He tells me how much he loved being tackled by me . If people only knew , he says and laughs . I laugh with him and then I kiss him again , but harder this time . He pulls away and holds my head in his hands . He looks at me like he 's gon na cry and he says , I love you , Kevin . I 'll love you forever . Promise me you 'll never leave me . Do n't be mental , Jon , I 'm never gon na leave you . I love you . He puts his hand on my cheek , and that 's when I hear the scraping of Floyd Anderson 's shovel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Floyd spazzes out if there 's even one speck of snow on the concrete . Somebody might slip in front of his house and sue him , and then he 'd lose everything , and then what 'd he do ? I leave Jon alone on my bed and look out the window at Floyd . He 's in his blue snowsuit , and the snowflakes sparkle in the light of the streetlamps . He 's resting , or maybe he 's reveling in the absolute stillness of the white like Mom used to do . Or maybe he 's receiving secret messages from the CIA through the pyramid on top of his head . He does n't budge for a minute , maybe two , and then the scrape , scrape , scrape begins again , echoing off the houses and apartment buildings and making the Bartochevitzes ' dog Max bark . I go back to my bed and Jon 's gone ; the stack of pillows is just a stack of pillows . I stare at the ceiling for a long time , blankly , the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front stoop in her ugly plaid coat and watch the snow fall . She 'd be out there for hours , not budging an inch . When I do fall asleep I dream of snow . Of the absolute stillness of the white . There 's a widow at the front door when I leave for school in the morning . She 's one of the regulars ; her name 's Jackie Shaw . You can tell that she used to smile a lot . She has these really deep crow's-feet like the canals on Mars that we 're studying in science class . Rick Foley thinks that Martians made them , but he can be a big fucking burnout ' cause he 's done way too many drugs . Still , it 'd be cool if there were Martians . Maybe on their planet guys can marry guys . " Why , good morning , Kevin , " Jackie Shaw says , sweet as you please . " I just wanted to drop these off for you boys . I bet you do n't get many hot breakfasts these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " They 're cinnamon rolls with real cream icing , " she tells me . " Just the thing to warm you up . " " Thanks . " She looks past me , into the sitting room . " Is your father at home ? Maybe he 'd like me to make a pot of coffee to wash these down with . " Dad 's upstairs getting ready for work , but I do n't tell her that . Instead I say , " Dad had an early shift today . He 's left already . " Her face falls a little bit , but then she rebounds . " Well , you enjoy those then . Would you let your father know I stopped by ? " I hear the blub-blub-blub of Tommy 's Challenger . In exactly three seconds he will honk the horn twice . " Yeah . Thanks , Mrs. Shaw . " Beep ! Beep ! This is when Mrs. Bartochevitz opens her front door and yells at Tommy for blasting his horn . I think she waits there for him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his car . In exactly five seconds Mrs. Bartochevitz will put her hands on her hips and scream across the street at me . " That 's my ride , " I tell Mrs. Shaw . " Does your friend have to do that ? " Mrs. Bartochevitz wants to know . I wave in Mrs. Shaw 's direction and jump in Tommy 's car . " What 's that ? " he asks , pointing at the box . " Cinnamon rolls , " I tell him . The love potion of widows . Exactly two years ago , this very minute , everything was normal . I walked the halls oblivious to Jon Thompson and his chocolate hair . Mom was alive and at the Midway Target , getting paper towels and laundry detergent , and a bag of Old Dutch ripple potato chips for me . The house smelled like lemons and my father was busy stacking palettes of cardboard stock against a plant wall . Exactly two years ago , twenty minutes from now , Mom 's car slid off East River Road , rolled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi . Exactly two years ago , one hundred and forty-three minutes from now , my teacher told me to report to the school nurse 's office where I found my Aunt Nora waiting for me . She said I should come live with her . But right now , I 'm late for English Lit . I see Jon Thompson in the hallway and I say hey . He looks at me weird and says , " Hey . " He keeps walking but I reach out and touch him on his bony shoulder . He stops and turns toward me , maybe waiting for another smack . Guys are always pissing on each other 's trees ; it 's like we ca n't help it . I say , real casual , like I 'm asking what time it is , " Any parties this weekend ? " " Have n't heard , " he tells me . I look at him . What do you say to the boy that you love when you are n't supposed to love boys ? Everything that I can think of sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He frowns . " If I knew of any , I 'd tell you , " he says , all defensive-like . " It 's cool , man , " I say , and I bolt , down the hall and away from him . Away from his deep brown eyes with the big cow lashes . Away from his scrawny shoulder that makes my hand shake like I 'm a spaz or something . Class has started by the time I get there . I sit on the white side of the room next to Rick Foley , who 's nodding his head in time to a tune only he can hear . He smiles at me ; he 's drawing a pair of biker-chick boobs in his notebook and the teacher thanks me for being so kind to stop by . His name is Mr. Hayes , a.k.a . Fey Hayes , the faggiest teacher at Northeast High . He looks like he 's sixty and in pain . All the time . ( Continues ... )            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
