Cherrystone , Washington <p> Emily Kenyon was proud of her deep blue suit and the polished silver star of the sheriff 's office on her jacket , yet the idea of an A-line skirt in late November was more than her thin blood could take . Why was n't there a pants option ? She was the first female sheriff for Cherrystone , but surely someone had thought that through before . It was an annoyance on chilly November days and thankfully she only had to wear the suit for official occasions that had more to do with public relations than law enforcement . Moreover , she had the sneaking suspicion the getup made her look like a flight attendant as much as anything . <p> That afternoon she had lunch with the Rotary Club to kick off the annual " Teddy Bears for Tots " fund-raiser , a statewide drive in which officers collected plush teddy bears for the littlest victims of crimes , accidents , and fires . Emily spoke for five minutes , shook the hands of several Rotary officers , and thanked them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The line felt hokey ; even so the crowd applauded . <p> As she exited the restaurant banquet room , she knew that she needed a warmer coat than her old trench if she wanted to keep from freezing . She ran through her mental list of things that had to be done . She needed to get her roots touched up at the salon . She also had to do something with the turkey carcass that occupied the top shelf in her refrigerator following Thanksgiving with Jenna , her twenty-two-year-old daughter , Chris Collier , her boyfriend-though she loathed the idea of a grown man being called a boyfriend - and her friend , Olga Cerrino . <p> Her cell rang . It was Jason Howard , her deputy . <p> " Kenyon here , " she said . <p> " Hi , Sheriff . It 's Jason . " <p> That they even bothered to identify themselves was almost a joke between them . Only a dozen employees made up the Cherrystone Sheriff 's Department . It was n't the smallest law enforcement organization , but it certainly was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call from Jeanne Parkinson at the clerk 's office . She 's worried about an employee . " <p> Emily knew Jeanne . She worried about everything . <p> " What 's going on ? " she asked . <p> " An employee did n't come to work today . " <p> Emily wanted to laugh , yet somehow she held it . " Is this what we 've been reduced to ? The attendance monitors for the county ? " <p> " That 's what I thought , but this could be different . They 're worried that something might have happened to Mandy on her way to work . " <p> " Mandy Crawford ? " <p> " Yeah . She 's pregnant , you know . " <p> " I know . She 's due any day , is n't she ? " Emily checked her teeth in the rearview mirror of her Kelly green county-issued Crown Vic . Spinach salad was never a good choice for a luncheon . Why did n't caterers understand that spinach leaves gripped teeth like Velcro ? <p> " Mitch says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Mitch was Mitch Crawford , Mandy 's husband . <p> " I 'm not far from there , " Emily said . " I 'll stop by and follow her route to the office . " <p> " Need the address ? " <p> " I know where everyone in Cherrystone lives . That 's how exciting my life is . " <p> " Gotcha , Sheriff . We 're in the same boat . " <p> She almost said something about the Titanic , but thought better of it . Jason Howard was her subordinate and admitting to him that they were both in dead-end jobs was counter-productive . The fact was that adrenaline junkies would die a slow death in Cherrystone . Nothing earth-shattering happened in Cherrystone . No murder in five years . There had been three rapes , twenty-eight burglaries/robberies , eighty-three assaults , and a couple hundred drug busts , mostly for meth-the scourge of small towns and rural communities across the West . <p> No one had to tell Emily who Mandy 's husband was . Mitch Crawford was a good eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family was well known for having the region 's car dealership . Cherrystone was certainly out of the way , with Spokane being its nearest major city . Mitch 's father , Eddie , however , had shown a knack for marketing that turned the car lot into a destination . He 'd fly people into Spokane from Seattle or Portland , pick them up in a limo , and make sure they returned home in one of his cars . He ran ads on TV and radio , and was inducted into the Marketing Hall of Fame in Reno , Nevada . When he died , Mitch took over . <p> The car lot was n't looking so sprightly these days . Mitch Crawford , it seemed , was no Eddie Crawford . <p> Mitch and Mandy lived in a hopelessly hokey development crafted for those who think showing off their money is the better part of having any . Their address was in the ridiculously named Bristol Estates-ridiculous because Cherrystone was nowhere near England , and the only thing English about the town was that most people spoke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a guard opened the gate . Bristol Estates was a small development with only fourteen homes on " equestrian lots " built with garish architectural embellishments . Each home had a " carriage " house for their cars and a turret that presumably fed fantasies for the would-be princes , Rapunzels , and Lancelots . <p> Emily parked the Crown Vic behind Mitch 's German-made sedan and wondered why Cherrystone 's biggest car dealer did n't drive a Ford like all his customers . <p> The leaded glass front door swung open . <p> " Emily , " Mitch called out . " Sorry you 've been dragged into this . " <p> He was better looking than she 'd remembered . He had broad shoulders , a strong , handsome jawline , and hair cut short in the way that men sometimes do when it is thinning . He was far too vain for a comb-over . He wore a Ralph Lauren sweater and slacks that looked a little too matchy-matchy , as though he 'd purchased them without the help of a woman who knew what really looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his dealership origins was nestled in his manscaped chest hair . He 'd tried to leapfrog from his car dealership lineage , but the gold jewelry , the bad taste , and a whiff of Calvin Klein 's Obsession were clues that he 'd not made it as far as he 'd liked . Despite the grand house . Or maybe , because of it . <p> " Dragged ? It 's my job , " she said . <p> " I know . Just seems silly . I 'm sure Mandy just went out shopping . " <p> " How come you 're home ? " <p> " Oh , just had to zip home for some stuff I need at work . " <p> " I see . " <p> He cracked the door open a little more , but still did n't come outside or offer Emily to come in out of the cold air . <p> " She was supposed to be at work , " she said . <p> " Oh , no . She 'd taken the day off . She had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped a little closer , craning her neck to see what , if anything was behind him . " They were expecting her at the clerk 's office . " <p> Mitch looked unconcerned . " Signals crossed , I think . I 'm not saying this to sound like a Neanderthal , but you know , she 's pregnant . She 's not exactly dotting all the i 's and crossing the t 's these days . " <p> Emily let the remark fly by . He was being a Neanderthal , but something was drawing her attention more than his words-the overpowering odor of bleach . <p> " Can I come in ? " she asked , a calming smile on her face . " Have a look around ? " <p> He looked at her warily . <p> " Sure . I was doing a little cleaning . I 'm done now . " <p> " Smells like bleach , " she said . <p> Mitch offered a kind of lifeless smile that seemed more for effect than for the conveyance of any warmth or charm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " she said , thinking at the same time that nothing obliterates blood and other body fluids better than bleach , too . <p> Mitch led Emily into the kitchen . Atop the black granite counter , Emily noticed a plastic bucket with soapy water . A mop was catawampus on the floor . Mitch followed her gaze , and picked it up . <p> " Trying to clean up , you know , baby coming soon , and the help has the day off . " <p> Emily surveyed the room , wondering if the help was his missing wife or a maid service with an 800 number . " Sure , " she said . She noticed a cappuccino machine that had to be commercial grade , a wine refrigerator , a walk-in Sub-Zero refrigerator , and a range with more burners than the nicest restaurant in Cherrystone . <p> " Nice kitchen , " she said . <p> He pulled his sweater sleeves up to his elbows , bunching up the fabric in soft folds . Cashmere . " We like nice things . Mandy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the house . It was clear that he 'd invited her in , but only so far . <p> " Can I see the bedroom ? You know , to be safe . I might see something that you 've missed . " <p> Mitch put his hand out , a gesture that meant to push her back-though she was already at arm 's length . <p> " I 'd rather not , " he said . " Mandy did n't make the bed and she 'd die if you saw the way we lived . She thinks so much of you . " <p> " She 's a nice girl . But I do n't mind . " <p> " But I do . I mean , Mandy would . " <p> With his dark brown , penetrating eyes , Mitch stared at Emily for a second , maybe two . <p> Dead air . Emily resisted the urge to fill the empty space . Let him . Let him say something he 'd regret . <p> Finally Mitch spoke . <p> " I hate to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to leave . " He started for the front door , and Emily followed . Past the kitchen , through the living room , down the hallway with its art gallery vibe-mostly modern , though she spotted a Thomas Kinkade painting of an English cottage dipped in pink roses and candlelight . <p> " Mandy likes that kind of crap , " he said . " Mall art . Jeesh . " <p> This guy was too much . His wife did n't show up for work and he was throwing her taste in art under the bus . Emily figured that Mitch Crawford was all about pretension , keeping up appearances . Control . <p> " What about your wife ? " she asked . " Where is she ? " <p> " What about her ? I told you she was shopping in Spokane . " His tone was impatient and he tried to reel it back in . " You know , for baby things . " <p> " You had n't told me where . Where in Spokane ? " <p> He escorted Emily toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the valley mall . " He held open the door . <p> " All right , " she said . " Tell Mandy to call the department when she gets in . " <p> Before Emily finished her sentence , he 'd already shut the door and turned the dead bolt . <p> Emily parked the cruiser in the SHERIFF spot in front of the terra-cotta facade of the City and County Safety Building , and walked to her office overlooking Main Street . Each time she passed the " Wall of Fame " - portraits of the sixteen men and the lone woman who 'd served as sheriff-she felt a wince of pain . It had been two years since Brian Kiplinger succumbed to a heart attack , an event that not only broke the hearts of all who worked there , but put Emily in line for the job as the sheriff . She 'd never wanted to be the damn sheriff ; moreover , she never wanted to work for anyone but Kip . She was appointed interim sheriff and the following year she won the election by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably did more for her landslide victory than unbridled support from a hometown electorate . A woman sheriff was a bit of a novelty , to say the least . <p> " How was lunch ? " The voice belonged to Gloria Bergstrom , the office dispatcher and , really , the glue that held the whole place together . She was in her midsixties , had steel-gray hair that she kept short and stylish , and never showed up for work without four-inch heels . There was good reason for that : in stocking feet , Gloria was only five feet tall . <p> " An inch shorter and I could have been a Munchkin in another life , " she joked whenever anyone made mention of her stature . <p> Emily smiled at Gloria . " Lunch was fine . Lots of promises of support . You know , working together , making a difference . The word will get out that those teddy bears are important to the kids . " <p> " Did you track down Mandy ? The women from the clerk 's office have called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off an earring that hurt like hell and picked up the phone . She pushed the speed-dial code for the clerk 's office . <p> " Nope , her husband says she went shopping- " She cut herself off and turned her gaze from Gloria to focus on the phone call she was making . " Jeanne ? Emily . I did a drive-by of the Crawford place and Mr. Personality said Mandy took the day off to go shopping for baby things in Spokane . " <p> " She did no such thing , " Jeanne said in her fluty voice . " She never would do that to us here . She is our best employee . " <p> " Maybe she left a message with someone else that she was sick or something ? " <p> " No . There 's no way she would do that . You see , Emily , today we were having a baby shower for her . It was n't exactly a surprise . She even picked out the cake . " <p> " I see , " Emily said , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was n't a thing out of place . Not only was Mitch Crawford a social climber who 'd rejected his middleclass roots for the accoutrements of a rich lifestyle , he was a self-absorbed ass . A lot of husbands were . She 'd had one of those herself . " Was anything going on between Mandy and her husband ? Was she angry at him ? " <p> " No , not that I know of . She was focused on the baby . That 's all she wanted . " <p> Emily nodded . " All right . I 'll check with Mitch this evening to make sure she came home . " <p> " Emily , one more thing . " <p> " What is it ? " She held her breath as if Jeanne was about to reveal some critical clue about why Mandy Crawford might skip work . Maybe she was mad at someone . Maybe Mitch had been beating her up . <p> " Can you send someone over here to get some of this cake ? No one here feels much like celebrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , " she said . She hung up the phone and went down the hall to find her deputy . He was at his desk surfing a Web site for ski conditions in Idaho . He clicked his mouse to close the window . <p> " Jason ? Can you find someone to go over to the clerk 's office ? Jeanne has something she wants to give us . " <p> " Right on it , Sheriff . " Emily smiled as her deputy leaped to his feet and started for the door . <p> Jason Howard was always hoping that something would happen around Cherrystone . What no one knew just then was it already had . <p> It was half past six and already dark . The snow-threatening cloud cover was a snug lid over the town . Despite the elements , the Bryant-Thompsons were still out stringing lights to outline every architectural detail of their two-story Victorian across the street from Emily 's charming but more modest home . The Bryant-Thompsons-Trevor and Mason-were one of those couples who insisted that it was n't Christmassy if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No bush was left unadorned , no skeletal tree left without a coating of little white lights . This year , Emily thought as she waved at the two men on ladders , she was n't going to give into her halfhearted attempt at trying to keep up with them . There was no point in it . She was doing a lighted wreath outside her front door and an artificial tree in the front window . That 's it . <p> She let herself inside and reached for her phone . The house was quiet . Jenna , home from her job consulting for a sorority 's national office , was in the shower . <p> Emily left her number with Mitch Crawford , but he had n't called back . She pressed redial and it went to his voice mail a second time . She went toward the kitchen , dropping her shoes by the back door and her purse on the stainless-steel island . She dialed the Crawford dealership next . A young woman answered . <p> " Mr. Crawford went home an hour ago , Sheriff Kenyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was stopping anywhere . You should be able to reach him there . Is everything OK ? " <p> " We 're worried about his wife , that 's all . " <p> " Oh , nothing to worry about . She 's fine . I 'm pretty sure she called in here and he talked to her . " <p> Emily felt a surge of relief . She thanked her , swung open the refrigerator , and looked at the foil-wrapped turkey . <p> Mandy Crawford is fine . I 'm in trouble here . What do I do with this thing ? I ca n't make soup for twenty ! <p> She retrieved a large kettle from the rack over the island and started filling it with water . She wrestled with the turkey carcass , snapping the bones and cramming it into the pot . Two cups of mirepoix , a cup of rice , and some salt and pepper , and she was done . <p> It was n't going to be the best turkey soup anyone ever made , but there would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Emily said as Jenna came into view , a ratty old robin 's egg blue robe wrapped around her slender body . " Maybe Santa will bring you a new robe . " <p> Jenna twisted her hair into a knot on her head and wrapped a thin , white towel around it . <p> " Only if I 'm good . " She smiled at her mother . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
