TWO DECADES AGO , HE HELPED INVENT THE MOUNTAIN BIKE AND INTRODUCED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO TWO-WHEELED FUN AND THE OUTDOORS . NOW HE BELIEVES WE ALL SHOULD BE RIDING A WHOLE NEW KIND OF BICYCLE . IS JOE BREEZE A VISIONARY OR JUST TILTING AT WINDMILLS ? Headnote JOE BREEZE DOES N'T JUST DREAM OF A NEW WORLD . Headnote A COOL BREEZE ? Can these bikes make transportation cycling hip ? It 'll be fun finding out . // He believes in it . Air will be fresher . Communities will be knit together closer . Traffic jams will be a thing of the past , and healthy families will pedal to school , to work , to the market on landscaped paths alongside courteous motorists . Joe Breeze 's terra nova will be a happier , cleaner , more peaceful place . Breeze wants to convince you , and everybody , that his vision is n't a fantasy . That it will happen in our lifetimes . And that it will happen because of Breeze 's object of devotion . " There 's almost nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , efficient or perfect than the bicycle . " He gazes around his garage in Fairfax , in Marin County , California . Dozens of examples of transcendence surround him . It almost feels like church . One time before , Joe Breeze changed the world . He was the reigning genius among the Northern California cohort , of which Gary Fisher is best known , that is widely credited with turning mountain hiking into a mass phenomenon that swept the globe in the 1990s . The bikes they created introduced an estimated 20 million people to two-wheeled fun , meshed bicycle riding and backwoods adventure in an unprecedented way , and dragged the sport away from the sparse province of road racers and long-distance tourists . Breeze , 49 , centers his entire existence on bikes . He rides almost everywhere . He built the first mountain bike frames , invented the unicrown fork , designed an early clipless pedal and was responsible for the most popular chichi in off-road history : the Hite-Rite , a must-have saddle adjuster for riders in the late 1980s . Breeze sold a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own line of bikes-they became instant classics for their stunning paint jobs and silky performance-but left the off-road cycling business five years later . He loved the sport but wanted to do something more than make a gilded plaything : " People drive their bikes to the trails . That 's consumption . It 's not where my heart is . " He set himself toward a bigger job . He went to Washington , talking to Congressional officials about bikes . Locally , he lobbied for kid-friendly routes to and from schools . Over one six-month period , he labored 1,300 hours to create a velo-friendly map of Marin County , so perfectly detailed it brings to mind a medieval octavo . He ordered bikes from Europe and Asia , testing them , researching their accessories , trying different generator lights and handlebar bells . The second coming of Breezer bikes arrived this past spring , but there was n't an off-road blaster or svelte road machine in sight . Instead , the new offerings resembled sleeker versions of the utilitarian models pedaled in cities like Amsterdam or Brussels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to transportation ? To appreciate how radical the idea is , consider this : Of more than 200 models offered by the nation 's top five cycling manufacturers , not one is equipped with racks , fenders , lights , kickstands and a lock . All eight Breezer commuters are . So what . Don Quixote tried to knock down windmills . Did n't make him a genius . But when you talk to Breeze , when he softly , in measured tones , marshals facts and figures , and illuminates his ideas , you begin to think : This guy 's smart . The next conclusion is just a step away . This guy might be right . START WITH THIS SEEMING IRONY : Joe Breeze 's father was a car nut . The armchair analysis , that the son 's bike mania is an act of rebellion , is not only stale but false . " What my father appreciated most , " says Breeze , offering a gentle correction , " was lightweight , mechanically efficient vehicles . " Still , a lot of those vehicles had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sports Car Club of America . He owned a Lotus dealership . In 1952 , he appeared on the cover of Road &; Track . But Bill , called Breeze by most friends , had a peculiar and thoughtful form of automotive mania . He preferred cars with sure handling over the muscled behemoths that won the day on America 's highways , and he refused to push his children into his high-rev world . " He did n't even let us get driver 's licenses until we were at least 18 , " Breeze says . In a family of speedsters , Bill Breeze " knew our genetics , " his son recalls . " He knew what we might do . " They did it anyway . Harnessing the family imprint , Joe and his older brother , Richard , separated by just 13 months , fixated on bikes . " We just rode and rode , " says Joe . The pair pedaled 400 miles to Lake Tahoe , down to Los Angeles , all through Marin County . Their trips became so frequent they carried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were inevitably nabbed as possible runaways . ( From memory , Joe Breeze recites : " It is okay for Rich and Joey to be bicycling on the highways .... " ) Breeze did n't get his driver 's license until he was 25 , and that was so he could ride a motorcycle . ( His friend Otis Guy , another mountain bike pioneer , offers a one-word comment on Breeze 's driving : " Lord ! " ) Joe Breeze does own a car ; in the past five years , he 's put less than 10,000 miles on his 1983 Saab 900 , mostly carrying bikes to and from his warehouse . By the 1970s , the Breeze brothers had joined a bike revolution that was sweeping America . Thousands of hardy travelers hitched panniers to their 10-speeds and pedaled off to see the country and the world . Breeze 's first international foray , in 1971 , was what finally consigned him to a two-wheeled fate . He pedaled across Europe . In Milan , he visited Cino Cinelli , the legendary Italian frame builder . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of shoes , but it did n't matter . To a trembling Breeze , it was " as good as shaking hands with God . " The trip 's final stop was Amsterdam . Breeze marveled at the pedal-friendly infrastructure . " Highways and traffic signs , all just for bikes , " Breeze says . " It opened my eyes . I thought : We have to do this at home . " But that same afternoon in Holland , Breeze saw something else that would detour his ambition for more than three decades : At a bike shop near the city 's Van Gogh museum , Breeze spied lengths of raw Reynolds tubing-the material bike frames were built from . They were for sale . Breeze was even more amazed than he was at the accommodating attitude the Dutch had toward bikes . " I was just standing there , " Breeze recalls , " stunned . I kept thinking : This is available to the public ? I can make frames myself ? " When he arrived home , Breeze got started . And the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE BREEZE . Though plenty of others contributed to the mountain bike legend , the official history focuses most sharply on these two , who still live less than a mile from each other in the long-hair-and-latte town of Fairfax , tucked against the eastern edge of the hills sweeping north from San Francisco 's Golden Gate . Assisted by a heavy and unapologetic bent toward promotion , Fisher is widely viewed as the sport 's inventor . Breeze is more anonymous , though two-wheeled cognoscenti see him as the phenomenon 's most rigorous technical mind . The story of the mountain bike 's creation has been told many times , with shifting characters and lots of permutations . Understanding the roles of Breeze and Fisher helps you understand why , today , one man oversees one of the world 's most popular brands of recreational playthings while the other tries to save the universe , one bike at a time . From 1976 to 1979 a fire road above Fairfax called Repack , which drops 1,300 feet over two miles , was mountain hiking 's Indy Brickyard : a percolating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new braking system ; Breeze would arrive with a new fork . Dozens would test their designs and , in the five minutes it took to make the descent , find out if they worked . Breeze was among the first to build bikes specifically for Repack , leading the sport away from scavenger machines cobbled together from junkyard finds and toward purpose-built models . But he was n't the most productive . " Joe 's a perfectionist , " says Otis Guy . " He was building some of the best bikes , but it became obvious that he was n't going to build the most of them . " Gary Fisher found another frame builder , Tom Ritchey , who worked much more rapidly . Fisher named his company MountainBikes ( a name purportedly coined by fellow pioneer Charlie Kelly ) and hit the big time . " People lined up at our shop , " Fisher says . " We were the only place you could walk in , pay your money , and ride out . " The competition between Breeze and Fisher was as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall the 22 Repack races , Fisher immediately boasts that he holds the course record : " Four minutes and 22 seconds . " Did he ever beat Breeze ? " Every time I rode against him , " Fisher says . When I mention this to Breeze the next time we talk on the phone , I hear paper rustle . A moment later , Breeze begins to read from his logbook of Repack standings : " Gary has the fastest time . Mine is second-fastest , by less than two seconds . " Breeze notes that Fisher had four first-place finishes , one second , and one fourth ; his own record is 10 first , seven seconds and one fifth . Quarter-century-old race results are n't the only record Breeze has at his disposal . He has detailed historical timelines of bike history , logs of many of his rides and , most prolifically , weather data : temperature , barometric pressure and rainfall for Marin County dating from 1969 . " It was a rainy winter , " Breeze says , in a sort of non-explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IDEALIST . To transform the world , you might have to stand alone . The notion that Americans will give up their cars and ride to work is one that prompts broad skepticism . While I was writing this story , I was told that Breeze would fail by two bike-industry product managers , one editor at this magazine and a waitress at my local coffee shop . ( A recent immigrant from Thailand , the waitress 's critique was most devastating : " I rode bikes to school when I was a little girl . Every day . When I came here , the first thing I got was a car . That 's what everyone wants . Nobody rides bicycles if they can drive . " ) There 's no doubt that the American commute is completely and totally broken , the result of 50 years of highway building and the creation of sprawling suburbs where pedestrians and bike riders are locked out by vicious intersections , cul-de-sacs and a lack of sidewalks . One of the biggest results : the near extinction of kids who bike to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children walked or pedaled to class . Today , less than 13 percent do . The overall statistics on bike commuting are equally bleak . Less than one percent of all urban trips in the U.S. are by bike , according to Transportation Quarterly magazine . In most European countries , that number hovers near 15 percent . But even with such poor representation , bike riders are a statistical majority of traffic fatalities . The cyclist death rate is about one per four million trips , according to the U.S. Department of Transportation . When rates are calculated based on distance traveled , that 's 36 times greater than the automotive fatality rate and 11 times more dangerous than walking . A Dutch bike commuter is 30 times less likely to be killed than his or her Stateside counterpart . What would make America safer for Joe Breeze 's revolution ? Advocates talk about bike lanes , driver education , parking and showers at work , but the bottom line is simpler : more riders . There 's some hope . Though the statistics against bicycle use are daunting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average driver spent about 20 hours stuck in traffic each year . Today , it 's more than 30 , and could quadruple in coming decades , says the Federal Highway Administration . Air quality is declining : The number of communities expected to fall out of compliance with the Clean Air Act is expected to triple in the next 10 years , according to the Brookings Institution . The cost of transportation is rising : It 's 18 cents per dollar earned for the average American household ; housing costs just a penny more . Biking may be statistically deadly , but cars win the sheer numbers game : Last year , almost 43,000 Americans perished in automobile wrecks , with an economic impact of more than $230 billion , according to Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta . Breeze says these facts make change inevitable . His voice sharpens : " It 's time to stop paying for other people 's wasteful ways . I know this wo n't happen overnight . It 's going to take years . " Then , he pauses , speaking softly again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU BUILD THE BIKES , WILL THEY RIDE ? Joe Breeze is assembling new Breezers in his garage , preparing them for a home-grown catalog shoot . The line includes three folding bikes , but the main attraction is eight models made exclusively for commuting . Some have three speeds , some seven . Models for longer , hillier trips have 27 . Prices start at $400 . One of the more radical ideas-unheard of in U.S. bike shops , where dealers often sell bikes as near-loss leaders while making their profits on higher-margin accessories-is that the Breezers are sold with a full complement of preinstalled add-ons : racks , fenders , lights , built-in locks , handlebar bells and kickstands . Seventy dealers carry the line . As with his mountain bikes , there 's an exacting attention to detail . On his original off-road series , Breeze continually fiddled with the ivory paint ; it was supposed to look like mat of a 1940s Schwinn Excelsior , but Breeze could " never get the color quite right . " For the new bikes , he spent months loading luggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he chose generator lights that store enough energy to remain lit during stops at traffic lights . It all gets expensive : A Breezer costs about double a standard hybrid , or comfort bike , to use the industry 's current term . One competing product manager scoffed : " They 're too expensive to make a difference , " he said , " and they 're not hip enough . " The laid-back machines most resemble a pair of bikes introduced to tepid consumer response in the 1990s . Bianchi , the Italian manufacturer , brought its gorgeous Milano into the U.S. fully equipped , as the Breezers are ; some dealers stripped the lights , fenders and racks off and sold them separately . ( A simpler version of the Milano is still available . ) In 1994 , Specialized introduced an elegant city bike called the Globe . " It was incredible , " says Breeze , who still has one in his garage and rode it until his own prototypes arrived . Specialized positioned the Globe as urban transit , a coffee-house cruiser , but the bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sold in 1999 . There are some indications of an emerging market for commuting bikes . Trek recently purchased Villiger , one of the largest European town-bike manufacturers ( former owner : a cigarette company ) , but so far , has n't decided whether to bring the line to the U.S. Skeppshult , the " Bike of Swedish Kings , " is offering a few models for upscale consumers . ( The old-school , all-black machines were featured in a recent Town &; Country magazine . ) But only Breezer offers a top-to-bottom line of complete bikes ; and they aim at the widest and riskiest swath of potential customers : people who hardly ride . " This is for people who walk into a bike shop with an idea of what they want-something to get them to the store , or to school-and end up being shown a room full of stripped-down roadsters , " Breeze says . " This is a bike that will finally let them see just what they 're looking for , loaded with everything they need , and take it home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me a year ago I 'd be selling $500 three-speeds , I 'd have laughed , " says Mike McGettigan , owner of Philadelphia 's Trophy Bikes . So far , the shop has sold 15 Breezers . In Portland , Oregon , Demetri Macrigeanis , of Veloce Bicycles , has sold more than 20 . " Joe hit a niche that I was skeptical even existed , " he says . Both dealers report that Breezer buyers are a bit older-40s or 50s-and a little more affluent than their standard customers . Portland is one of the nation 's most bike-friendly cities . Philadelphia , like New York and Boston , has a downtown built for riding , if not a full-fledged infrastructure . What about cities more hostile to pedaling ? During the reporting of this story , I stopped into Hollywood 's L.A. Bike Tours &; Cyclery , a friend 's shop in Los Angeles , where owner Chris Kelly was coincidentally completing his first Breezer sale to Ken Medina , a 41-year-old high school English teacher . Medina had n't owned a bike for years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breezer website . " I was surprised to find a bike like this really existed , " says Medina , who plans to use the seven-speed for errands and a partial commute . " I got the feeling the bike was made with somebody like me in mind . " One thing the Breezer is n't is an aggressive , racy , messenger-style machine . The bikes are hardy performers , something like Volvos . The Breezer is designed to be ridden below the sweat level , and probably on a bike-specific route . That final attribute is the most controversial feature . Breezers have skidded into one of the two-wheeled world 's most factionalized debates : the argument between " vehicular " and " facilities " riders . The first group , led by John Forester ( author of a phone-book-sized manifesto called Effective Cycling ) , believes that bikes are vehicles , belong in traffic lanes and should be treated as such . Facilities cyclists advocate bike paths and lanes , keeping riders apart from automobiles . The vehicular bunch , who derisively call their opponents the " paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their position : " The idea that a significant amount of transportation will be done by politically correct people who have been enticed by false promises of safety to ride on slow and dangerous bike paths deserves all the jeering it receives , " says Forester on his website ( johnforester.com ) . " Basing a national cycling program on such a pathetic hypothesis is a disgrace . " Any regular city rider knows Forester is right about the superiority of moving with the cars and buses . The problem , as Breeze recognizes , is that non-cyclists are never going to buy it . " Riding with traffic is an art form , " says Breeze , " and unless you do it regularly , you 're not going to want to do it . Where it 's possible , you should have separate pathways . " The Breeze machines are the ultimate bike-lane cruisers . That 's their advantage and also their biggest risk . The product line not only anticipates but is nearly dependent upon the emergence of an infrastructure that barely exists in most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a $247 billion transportation bill under consideration in Congress , and the Bush administration has proposed allocating about $550 million annually for projects known as " transportation enhancements . " Bikes will compete with dozens of other programs , including billboard control , landscaping , scenic highway programs , and , as the U.S. Department of Transportation says , the " establishment of transportation museums , " for that cash . Facilities advocates point to places like the Netherlands as proof that increased bike usage is a workable concept . But the " they do it in Holland " argument occupies the same zone that prompts well-meaning folks to wonder why Europeans have more-comprehensive health coverage , greener recycling programs , decriminalized drug laws and better chocolate . There 's no real answer . America is just different . But that external , and possibly eternal , truism wo n't affect Breeze , says Otis Guy : " Can one person overcome the car companies , the oil companies ? Is Joe Breeze the person to break our dependence on automobiles ? That 's not how he should be judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that he could . " WHEN I BEGAN THIS STORY , I wanted to understand whether Joe Breeze understood , or whether he 'd been holed up in his basement workshop too long , dreaming of a perfect world and measuring rainfall . When I asked Breeze if he believed he was bucking the odds , that even bike enthusiasts viewed him with skepticism , he answered with a typically unique interpretation of the question : " I 've been a bike enthusiast all my life . Why is it that I get it and others do n't ? It might be a personality trait , or even a defect , but , really , I just believe that those folks have n't thought it over well enough . I can see it working . And I know if I can hold onto that-hold onto what I believe is good-then other people can understand . " Every time I talked to Breeze , I found myself admiring him more and more , buying into his vision and feeling terrified that it might be shattered , might fail , devastatingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when you hang around with him , you begin to feel guilty for your own cynical outlook . You do n't want him to be disappointed . During our conversations , Breeze often talked about his brother , Richard . " He 's the one who first showed me what bikes could do , " Breeze told me . Richard 's name came up so many times that I wanted to interview him ; Breeze told me , softly , that his brother died 12 years ago . I left it at that . A few days later , as I searched newspaper databases for mentions of Joe , I came across an item published in the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 12 , 1991 , just a few weeks before the first Persian Gulf war : " A 38-year-old man who committed suicide Thursday night by setting himself on fire in San Francisco 's Marina District was apparently distraught over U.S. military action in the Persian Gulf . Two hours before he doused his body with gasoline and set himself ablaze , Richard W. Breeze , of San Rafael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pierce and McAllister streets .... At the conclusion of the 10 p.m. service Breeze stood and asked the congregation for $10 to buy gasoline for the ride home , said his brother , Joe Breeze .... " Died for peace ? For a better world ? It seemed impossible , sad beyond words . I knew I had to ask about Richard Breeze , but I did n't know how . When I spoke to Otis Guy , he took a deep breath and sighed : " Richard was a perfectionist , " he said . " Like Joe . Just like his dad . In Joe 's case , that 's been a good thing . But Richard 's attempt to bring his ideals to the world-and learning that he could n't do it , not completely-became too hard for him to take . It wrecked him emotionally . " Guy paused . " Joe 's emotional distance is n't because of his brother 's death . It 's what 's helped him live with his own perfectionism . " I asked Guy whether he felt it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think so , " Guy replied . " I think Joe would like it if , in some way , Richard 's life could be defined by what a good soul he was-and not by the exclamation point that ended it . " During my last interview with Breeze , we talked about lots of things . I was mostly filling in the blanks . Breeze laughed hysterically when I told him I 'd heard his son Tommy 's first word was " Campagnolo . " ( It was n't , though it was close , coming when the toddler was admiring a shiny new crankset , and Breeze got him to repeat the product 's legendary brand name . ) I 'd interviewed people with tragedies in their lives before , but I was finding it hard to get around what Guy called " the exclamation point . " My last question to Joe Breeze before writing this story was about Richard . I do n't necessarily believe that Joe Breeze is emotionally distant . But he does choose his words carefully , and that deliberation could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animated when the topic is bikes , which have occupied his heart so long . They 're so much a part of his self-knowledge that the revelations slip out easily . It was the same when he talked about his brother . " I 'm glad you asked , " Breeze said . " So few people do , and it makes me sad to think he 's not being remembered . " Richard Breeze , Joe said-the interview was being conducted just days after the most recent war in Iraq began- " was a very big-hearted person . He cared a lot about the world , and he held such deep beliefs . " Breeze paused . A few weeks earlier , the entire Breeze family had attended a peace rally in San Francisco . Breeze was carrying an American flag . It was , he said , a symbol of his beliefs , his patriotism , his humanity . " I want to dedicate my life to improving life for other people in this country . " Of course , Breeze said , he 'd thought about Richard during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me how to look at things . He was so important to what I 'm doing today , " Breeze said . " He got me on a bike .
