Section : TRANSITION DOLLY , 6 <p> Not since Noah 's Ark has so much ridden on the fate of a single ewe . In 1996 , when Scottish doctors created a baby sheep named Dolly from the cells of an adult , she became the first-ever successfully cloned mammal . Her  --  well , not birth  --  her emergence also sparked a fierce debate about ethics , biology and playing God . She died at 6  --  half the life expectancy for her species . But Dolly 's doctors insisted her death was unrelated to the fact that she was a freak of nature  --  or of whatever . She simply caught a virus she could n't shake , and had to be euthanized . BOB HOPE , 100 <p> He was such a lousy actor that Oscar night at his house was called Passover . ( Laughter . ) " But lemme tell ya ... " We thought he 'd never stop . Actually , for a radio guy , Bob Hope did fine in Hollywood . His " Road " pictures with Bing Crosby made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural on TV . But his visits to U.S. troops from World War II through Gulf War I made him a legend . Those rat-a-tat one-liners got old before he did , but he milked laughs for 80 years without cuss words or cruelty : his favorite target was himself . ( " I 've performed for 12 presidents ... and entertained six . " ) What he lacked in cool , he made up for in warmth . Wartime is always hard , but this time around , it 's just a little harder . STROM THURMOND , 100 <p> Before becoming the oldest and longest-serving senator ever  --  48 years  --  he was governor of South Carolina and the Dixiecrat presidential candidate . The Senate was truly his life ; he died only months after his retirement . Strom Thurmond will be remembered for his fights to keep blacks off the voting rolls and out of white public schools  --  and for the most recent news . His family finally acknowledged that the man who 'd campaigned against " the social intermingling of the races " had fathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family 's home . MADAME CHIANG KAI-SHEK , 105 <p> In America she was once a dazzling symbol of China 's future  --  modern , educated , pro-Western . In China she was a hated reminder of tyranny and corruption . Married to the Chinese Nationalist Party chief , she was his link to the United States  --  and its aid dollars . The couple squandered millions before being exiled to Taiwan in 1949 . ELIA KAZAN , 94 <p> Whether by choice or not , Elia Kazan was an outsider all his life . The director of " On the Waterfront , " " A Streetcar Named Desire " and " East of Eden " crafted powerful films about life on America 's margins ; his advocacy of the Method , with its channeling of raw emotion , revolutionized Hollywood acting . ( His stars earned 21 Oscar nominations . ) But at the height of his success , he spilled the names of communists he 'd known to the House Un-American Activities Committee . He was derided and ostracized ; even 40 years later , his lifetime-achievement Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death . So will the work . KATHARINE HEPBURN , 96 <p> She did n't do coy . She was n't a femme fatale . She was n't about being pretty . And she did n't give a damn . She came to conquer , and she did : she earned 12 Oscar nominations , a record four wins  --  three of them after the age of 60  --  and became the most indomitable actress of her era , which still is n't over . Hepburn once said she wanted to " live like a man . " Instead , she re-defined what it meant to live like a woman . She played queens , debutantes , athletes  --  and even actresses  --  but her greatest role was Katharine Hepburn . We could have watched her play it forever . JOHNNY CASH , 71 ; JUNE CARTER CASH , 73 <p> It was country music 's best love story : the craggy Man in Black and a daughter of country 's First Family , the legendary Carters . She stuck with him through drugs and degenerative illness ; when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plain-as-dirt baritone gave his songs of hard luck and violence , love and faith , a directness and conviction that transcended their genre . June was n't in his league as a singer  --  who was ?  --  but " Ring of Fire , " which she wrote about their scary early relationship , was one of his greatest hits , and one of country 's great songs . The stark 1994 " American Recordings " helped a new generation hear Johnny Cash as a still-vital contemporary  --  but really , he always was . EDWARD TELLER , 95 <p> His admirers say the Father of the H-bomb helped keep the Soviet Union in check with Mutually Assured Destruction . Edward Teller 's detractors call him a Strangeloveian obsessive , cheerleader for an arms race whose products could still destroy humanity . Early on , the Hungarian-born physicist helped America split the atom ; when the U.S.S.R. set off its own fission bomb , he started work on fusion weapons : thermonuclear devices a thousand times more powerful . Teller 's hatred of Soviet tyranny led him to promote fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Star Wars defense initiative . GERTRUDE EDERLE , 98 <p> Yes , Gertrude Ederle was the first woman to swim the English Channel , but there was more to it than that . In 1926 the 20-year-old made it from Cape Gris-Nez , France , to Kingsdown , England  --  21 miles as the crow flies  --  in 14 hours and 31 minutes , more than two hours faster than any of the five men who 'd done it before . Imagine what her time would have been if rough seas had n't kept tossing her off course . She actually swam some 35 miles , keeping up her pace by singing " Let Me Call You Sweetheart . " FRED ROGERS , 74 <p> The cardigan , white Keds and indelible jingle " Wo n't You Be My Neighbor ? " became part of America 's collective childhood thanks to PBS 's " Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood . " From 1968 to 2001 , Fred Rogers ( an ordained Presbyterian minister ) invited kids into his tiny make-believe town to meet X the Owl and Henrietta Pussycat . Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After 9/11 , he came out of retirement to do a public-service announcement helping children deal with the not-so-perfect neighborhood outside their doors . DONALD O'CONNOR , 78 <p> Nobody hated the " Francis the Talking Mule " movies more than Donald O'Connor himself . The song-and-dance man with the flexibility of a Gumby and the buoyancy of a helium balloon never rose above second fiddle in Hollywood : sidekicking with Gene Kelly in " Singin ' in the Rain , " belting with Ethel Merman in " There 's No Business Like Show Business . " But  --  a mule ? Still , O'Connor never let the bitterness show . A second fiddle , maybe , but the man knew how to play . SAM PHILLIPS , 80 <p> He 'd aspired to be a criminal lawyer , but Sam Phillips had to settle for becoming the most legendary producer in American music . In his Memphis storefront studio , Phillips was the first to record B. B. King and Howlin ' Wolf , and put out what 's been called the first rock-and-roll song : Jackie Brenston 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a white singer who sounded black ; he found Elvis Presley . His tiny Sun Records also launched Carl Perkins , Jerry Lee Lewis , Johnny Cash , Roy Orbison ... in other words , the second American Revolution . AL HIRSCHFELD , 99 <p> An institution at The New York Times for more than 75 years , the artist Al Hirschfeld drew nearly every ninaoteworthy performer to grace the Broadway stage or the silver screen . His pen-and-ink caricatures were immediately recogninazable and conferred upon their subject a status that arguably no writer or photographer could . But he was perhaps best known for his whimsy : he hid the name of his daughter in every drawing . Pity we ca n't recall her niname . LENI RIEFENSTAHL , 101 <p> She was a vastly promising director when Hitler hired Leni Riefenstahlto film a 1934 Nazi rally at Nuremberg . " Triumph of the Will "  --  the greatest propaganda film ever  --  destroyed her . After four years in prison she became a photographer , swearing to the end she did n't know the evil she 'd estheticized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never directed again . CELIA CRUZ , 77 <p> The Queen of Salsa was Cuba 's premier diva throughout the ' 50s , before she defected to the United States during a tour of Mexico in 1960 . She never went back again . In the States , she worked with such top Latin bandleaders as Tito Puente ; eventually she recorded more than 70 albums . Fans loved her powerhouse vocals , sassy attitude ( she would n't divulge her age ) and Technicolor wigs . Beginning in the ' 70s , interest in their heritage among younger Latinos gave Cruz a new prominence ; her last CD won a Grammy in 2002 . GREGORY PECK , 87 <p> Atticus Finch , he once said , " will be the first line in my obituary . " And sure enough . His Oscar-winning role in " To Kill a Mockingbird "  --  a white Southern lawyer defending a black man on trial for rape  --  made Gregory Peck America 's white-collar hero with a blue-collar heart . Atticus 's square-chinned nobility would define Peck 's career , on screen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ronald Reagan did n't like him much , but for most Americans he remains a symbol of what we aspire to , for our country and ourselves : Honor . Humility . Courage . Atticus . DAVID BRINKLEY , 82 <p> He and NBC News co-anchor Chet Huntley both disliked that sign-off : " Good night , Chet . " " Good night , David . " But it brought a note of comfort to the generally grim news of the 1960s  --  and it was great TV . David Brinkley 's lean visage and his slightly wry , slightly North Carolina-accented delivery was something new : an authoritative but cool presence that ideally suited the medium . So did his writing : crisp , clear and with a sense of when to shut up and let the footage speak for itself . " Brinkley , " said Reuven Frank , his boss at NBC , " writes silence better than anyone else I know . " He 'd think this was tacky , but  --  good night , David . IDI AMIN , 78 <p> During the 1970s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdering 300,000 of Uganda 's 12 million people , expelling tens of thousands of others and turning the coffers of his once thriving African nation into a personal piggy bank . A career soldier , Idi Amin seized control of the Army and police force and , eventually , the country . Once in power , he quashed dissent by publicly executing his critics : cabinet ministers , diplomats and church leaders were shot point-blank or forced to bludgeon one another to death before a horrified citizenry . He fled Uganda in 1979 and wound up living in seclusion in Saudi Arabia . ALTHEA GIBSON , 76 <p> She learned to play tennis in the most unlikely of places : the blacktop in front of her childhood home on West 143d Street in Harlem , which police had cordoned off as a play area for local kids . It took talent , will  --  and this stroke of luck  --  for a poor black girl in a segregated world to become a champion at one of the whitest , most privileged of sports . In 1957 , Althea Gibson became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Wimbledon . Shaking the hand of Queen Elizabeth II as she accepted the trophy , Gibson said , " At last , at last . " And she won again the next year . DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN , 76 <p> In 1980 , Daniel Patrick Moynihan said the decade 's defining event would be the end of the Soviet Union . Prescient as usual . The witty , tweedy Harvard professor was an ambassador under Nixon and Ford before becoming a Democratic senator from New York  --  yet found time to write such influential books as " Beyond the Melting Pot . " Moynihan was early in arguing that family breakup slowed black advancement ; his ideas crossed partisan lines , prompting the debate he so loved  --  and often the action , too . JOHN RITTER , 54 <p> Critics never cared for the hit sitcom " Three 's Company , " but none of them ever blamed John Ritter . As Jack Tripper , the closeted heterosexual posing as gay so his landlord would let him shack up with two female roommates , Ritter soared above the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV 's top series from 1977 to 1984 . Another actor would 've spent the rest of his career trying to escape such a creation , but Ritter was so versatile that his work in such indie films as " Sling Blade , " and as TV 's most dependable guest star ( " Ally McBeal " ) , bore no trace of Tripper . At the time of his sudden death , Ritter was again carrying a sitcom , ABC 's " 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter . " ROBERT C. ATKINS , 72 <p> Dieting once meant Melba toast and celery . Then , in 1972 , the best-selling " Dr. Atkins ' Diet Revolution " made steak and eggs America 's weight-loss plan of choice  --  though the cardiologist battled the medical establishment , which warned against his no-starch , high-fat plan . To date , 30 million people have lost 200 million pounds , and even onetime critics order burgers  --  hold the bun . IN A TIME OF WAR <p> As we went to press , 460 American troops had died in Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , 53 of them from the United Kingdom and 17 from Italy . The civilian death toll in Iraq may have approached 10,000 ; in Baghdad alone , more than 2,000 occupation-related deaths have been reported since May 1 , the official end of hostilities . These are the numbers  --  and we know they do n't quite register . How could they possibly ? But each one had a name , though some may never be known . Each one had a story , of incalculable worth , though some may never be told . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : KATHARINE HEPBURN <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : ELIA KAZAN <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : GERTRUDE EDERLEY <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : DONALD O'CONNOR <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : GREGORY PECK <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : ALTHEA GIBSON <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : DOLLY <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : STROM THURMOND <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : BOB HOPE <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : JOHNNY CASH , JUNE CARTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHOTO ( COLOR ) : IDI AMIN <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : CELIA CRUZ <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : IN A TIME OF WAR <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : JOHN RITTER <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ROBERT C.
