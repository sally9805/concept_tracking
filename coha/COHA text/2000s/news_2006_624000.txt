<p> During the long and erratic trajectory of his composing career , William Finn has written stage musicals about death , AIDS and his own brush with death following brain surgery ( " A New Brain " ) . The Washington Post called him " the composer laureate of loss . " <p> With a resume like that , Finn 's latest work , the Tony-winning " The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee , " seems anomalous . Strange , no ? To segue from life-and-death scenarios to a buoyant romp about middle-school misfits at a suburban spelling competition . <p> " I think it shocked a lot of people , " the bearish , gray-bearded Finn said during a conversation in his composing studio on Manhattan 's Upper West Side . Heretofore , his biggest success had been " Falsettos , " a musical set in the early years of AIDS , about a man who leaves his wife for another man and then sees his male lover succumb to the epidemic . <p> But even when Finn was dealing with issues of loss , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indivisible from the tragedy . " I see it as one long line , " he says . " This ( ' Spelling Bee ' ) is not an aberration . It 's just that people never asked me to do it before . " <p> In " Spelling Bee , " which opened to rave reviews on Broadway last May and premieres March 1 at the Post Street Theater , six spellers , ages 12 to 14 , match wits on such multisyllabic brain-stoppers as " syzygy " and " pyrrhuloxia . " It 's a hapless but adorable lot : tragic Olive Ostrovsky , horny Chip Tolentino , overachieving Marcy Park , perpetually embarrassed Leaf Coneybear , pigtailed Logainne Schwartzandgrubenierre and chunky William Barfee ( rhymes with " parfait " ) , who ca n't spell without tracing words on the floor with his shoe . <p> " We like spelling , " the misfits sing in triumph . " It 's a way to not feel rotten . " An adult emcee/administrator , a word announcer and a gruff " comfort counselor " round out the ensemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete in the bee . <p> In a New York Times review , Charles Isherwood called the show " effortlessly endearing " and " lovingly hand-stitched . " A box-office hit from the beginning , " Spelling Bee " stunned the New York theatrical community last September when it recouped its $3.5 million investment just 18 weeks after opening . <p> " It 's easy going down , " Finn , 52 , says of the show 's mixture of innocence , satire and underdog wish fulfillment . A big , rumpled man with a sandpaper voice and curmudgeonly facade , Finn lives close to his studio with Arthur Salvatore , his partner of 25 years . Finn was a whiz at school and a very good speller , he says , but used his wit to deflect the teasing usually directed at geeks and freaks . <p> Precocious to a fault , in third grade he announced , " I 'm going to be a singing pediatrician when I grow up . " " My grandparents always told me I should be a doctor , so I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cast : " I was supposed to write a paper on the diseases around the Panama Canal . And I just wrote it as a musical : all about yellow fever and tsetse flies . " <p> Finn did n't originate " The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee , " but got involved when his longtime friend , playwright Wendy Wasserstein , called to tell him about its initial incarnation . " It was an improvised sketch , " he says , " with no story , no character development . But it was a very funny piece . " <p> Wasserstein died Jan. 30 of lymphoma ; and Finn , who had known her for more than 20 years , has a hard time speaking about her . Wasserstein knew about that early production , he says , because her daughter 's nanny , Sarah Saltzberg , was in the original cast . <p> " And because Wendy loved her so much she went down to see her in this toilet downtown where they were doing this improvised sketch . " The " toilet " was the Present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farm , an improv collective run by Rebecca Feldman , performed . Finn never went , but saw a six-minute video promo of the piece , at that time called " C-R-E-P-U-S-C-U-L-E . " <p> It was raw and unformed , but Finn saw something " fabulous " in it . " For the first time in my muddy , muddled life , " he remembers , " I knew what to do with the show . How to make it work . It 's the only time I 've ever been like that ... I kind of had been waiting my whole life for it . " <p> At the time , " Spellbound , " a documentary about spelling competitions , had come out and friends advised Finn to shun the project because the material was so close . He ignored them . With Feldman 's consent , Finn brought in Rachel Sheinkin , a student of his from New York University 's graduate musical theater writing program , to write the book ( she later won a Tony ) , and started to write some songs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't directing . " But I was the oldest , the fattest and the meanest and I was calling all the shots , " Finn says , tempering bluntness with a mildly theatrical delivery . " They were afraid to contradict me , and they were right , ' cause I knew what I was doing . " <p> In January 2004 , a workshop production , by now retitled " The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee , " opened at the Barrington Stage Company in Sheffield , Mass. , and became an instant word-of-mouth hit . " You could n't get tickets , " Finn says . " For some reason people wanted to see this show , right from the very beginning . " <p> The show returned to Barrington Stage in August 2004 , by which point word had filtered to Manhattan . Several nonprofit theaters wanted to produce it off-Broadway , but Carole Rothman  --  artistic director of Second Stage , Finn 's friend and producer of his 1981 musical " In Trousers , " prevailed , and opened the show in February 2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sondheim 's " Into the Woods " and " Sunday in the Park with George " ) was brought in , and Feldman , who retains a " Conceived By " credit in the show , bowed out . <p> For Finn , the swift road to success for " Spelling Bee " is surreal . For years he had worked on a show for Elaine Stritch , a musical version of George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber 's " The Royal Family , " only to see it grind to a halt when the producers refused to pay the hefty fee for adaptation rights . <p> It was the kind of setback that hobbles many artists , especially one as vulnerable and heart-on-the-sleeve as Finn . And so , when " Spelling Bee " presented itself with such clarity and perfect timing , he jumped at it : " I identified with these kids . And I also knew that this was a piece that was really funny and could bring a lot of joy . And it was a time in my life when I needed the joy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is still playing at the Circle on the Square in New York . A production recently opened in Melbourne , Australia , and a national tour , separate from the San Francisco production , is in the works . It 's Finn 's first big hit since winning two Tonys for " Falsettos " in 1992 ( " We had our valleys " ) , and the difference in the way people treat him now amuses him . <p> " People want to be with people who have a hit . It 's amazing to me that when you have a hit people throw things at you , in a good way . They 're always giving you things . When you need the things they withhold and the world is a miserable little place . But when you 're successful they ca n't give you enough .
