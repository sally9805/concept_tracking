GOD , IT 'S NICE TO KNOW you 've been an asshole , too , " said Terry in his quiet , friendly way . <p> We were real comfortable , sitting in busted chairs in the office behind my French Quarter antique shop and working on a nice California Merlot . It was a rainy night , a night for talk , and I 'd been telling him a sad story from , oh , nineteen , maybe twenty years before , when I picked up and brought home from Ched 's Lounge a very small , fragile female named Willie . <p> My object had been the usual one , but it had n't worked out as I expected . Was it her fragility , her delicate china-cup beauty , the sense I had that she might break in my hands if I was n't careful ? Anyway , instead of enjoying and then forgetting a one-night stand , I became-well , I guess the word is besotted with her . <p> For the first and last time in my prosy damn life , I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flower of the purple wood sorrel and her pure voice to the song of the mockingbird . I must have been really disgusting for a while . Then my store was burgled - clearly an inside job - and Willie disappeared . Well , the burglar left his fingerprints all over everything , and the cops caught the big coarse dumb lout and recovered most of the loot . <p> Do I need to say that he was Willie 's lover ? He went to Angola and Willie just vanished , I never knew where . <p> " I went through something a bit like that , " said Terry . " Only more ... offbeat . " <p> He sighed and slowly detached his feet from his Gucci loafers and wiggled his silk-socked toes and started to look a little less like a tax lawyer and more like a human being . I had hired him for combat with the IRS and we 'd become friends mainly out of mutual loneliness-Terry was living with five dogs , and for the time being I was living with nobody . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut and the rain coming down in nine-foot cubes , I felt ready to listen to Terry 's tale of how he , too , was betrayed by love and beauty . But I was not expecting anything like what I heard . <p> You 're not , Terry began , the only guy dumb enough to think you 'd found love in a saloon . One night about five years ago I was in The Exile over on Toulouse Street , swilling and hunting love , when suddenly I spotted this absolutely breathtaking blond at the bar . Even then I was n't exactly the young Richard Chamberlain , so I thought : Sure , dream on . <p> But then a friend of mine came by . I said , Who 's that over there ? And he said , Oh , that 's Pat Something . He 's nuts , you do n't want to meet him . Oh , yes I do , I said . <p> So my friend introduced us , and at first Pat received me with the total lack of interest I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer , and then he said , Oh really ? Maybe you can help me . I asked him what kind of trouble he was in , and he said he was being stalked . <p> I said , Maybe I can help . I was thinking , Sex maniac , I can believe that ; skinhead , I can believe that . Pat said , I 'm being stalked by a demon , and I thought , I ca n't believe that . <p> But the guy was gorgeous , so I said , Why do n't we go to my place ? I live right down the street and we can talk this over . He gave me a despairing look and said , I ca n't have sex right now . <p> Hey , I said with a smile , I 'm not one of those guys like John F. Kennedy have to have sex every night or they ca n't sleep . Pat asked , Is John a friend of yours ? I thought Ire was kidding , so I gave him an encouraging smile . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to my house and I let us in . In those days I only had two dogs , but they greeted us joyously and Pat seemed to relax a little , tussling with them while I got us fresh drinks . And hey , he was even more gorgeous with his hair tousled and dog spit all over his face than he had been when he was nice and neat . <p> So we relaxed a little and then I got professional and said , Now tell me , Pat , how did this stalking begin ? Thinking that once I found out who was doing it I might do something , get a restraining order or something , endearing myself to Pat in the process . So very slowly , at times in a trembling voice , he began to tell me his story . <p> Pat had been living at home with his mother in some ungodly place down near the Projects . He was a slum flower , I guess you might say ; he must have been kind of a steel magnolia , too , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are killed routinely . His mother drew welfare and worked part-time as a barmaid and she lived with a succession of guys who were all given the honorary title of Pat 's father . Pat was thinking about moving out anyway when his final father came along . <p> By then Pat 's mother was n't as young as she used to be . Time was when the guys called her Skinny Minny , but at thirty-nine she had a pot belly and other signs of hard use and advancing years . Her men were no longer like the John Travolta of Saturday Night Fever , they were more like the John Travolta of Pulp Fiction . So when Pat came home after a hard day 's work as a busboy at Jour et Nuit and heard familiar sounds from the bedroom he figured he knew what to expect . Minnie was in the sack with her latest toad . <p> The house was a shotgun - one room behind the other - so he had to walk through her bedroom to get to his own . He knocked and yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tufted pink bedspread , but even so Pat had to make an effort not to gawk at the freak Minny had connected with this time . He was bald and his skull had strange bumps like little horns over the temples . He had a lantern jaw and protruding eyes and his lower left canine tooth was permanently outside his mouth . It stuck up and kind of fitted into a notch it had worn in his upper lip . Incredibly , he had only three fingers and a thumb on each hand , and it was n't because he 'd been in some industrial accident or something , it was because he was born that way . He was the single ugliest man Pat had ever seen , and he could n't imagine how she could let him touch her , much less anything else . <p> " I suppose , " I suggested , " that he had hidden charms . Hidden under the bedspread , that is . " <p> " You know it , " said Terry . " The sounds from his mother 's bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign - that was his name , by the way ; Pat figured he must be a Cajun roughneck from the oil rigs . The old rusty box spring squeaked , and Minny squealed , and Bodeau grunted , and this went on until the dawn 's early light . " <p> " More wine ? " I asked , and Terry said , " Definitely . " <p> On his way out , he went on , Pat had to walk through his mother 's room again , and there was Minny-sleeping the sleep of the exhausted beside Bodeau , who was snoring with his eyes open and only the whites showing . One of Bodeau 's feet was sticking out from under the covers and it had only three toes on it , all with long sharp nails . <p> Pat was staring hypnotized at this spectacle when the snoring stopped and Bodeau 's right hand shot out and grabbed his wrist . That was when Pat realized something else . Bodeau was the strongest man he had ever had grab him , and in his short life quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little as Bodeau rose to a sitting position and Pat became aware that the guy had shoulders like King Kong , including the fur . Bodeau pulled Pat close to him and grinned into his face . He had dragon 's breath and his teeth were brownish and round like pegs , with spaces in between . Bodeau said one word . He said Later . <p> Then he slumped back and started to snore again , and his eyes rolled up until only the whites showed . Pat stood there paralyzed for a while , and then crept out of the house and never went back . <p> Pat had had some experience with bisexual " fathers " who viewed his mother and himself as , shall we say , main course and dessert . Or sometimes as appetizer and main course . But none of them had been flat-out disgusting ; one or two had actually had a touch of savoir-faire , as if life was after all a French farce , so why not enjoy it ? But Bodeau did not seem to be into savoir-faire , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody he could catch , male or female . No holes , you might say , barred . <p> So Pat ran . <p> For a while his friends took care of him . This guy loaned him a clean shirt , that guy let him sleep on the sofa . They all screwed him sooner or later because he was kind of a damsel in distress , and you know what generally happens to damsels in distress . Then Bodeau started tracking him . One day Pat looked out of the kitchen at Jour et Nuit and there he was , peering in through the window from the street . That night Pat woke up to a skreeking sound and there was Bodeau , standing outside the window and scratching on the glass with a sound like a nail on a blackboard . What took it out of the realm of the merely scary and into the hair-raising was the fact that that window happened to be three stories up with no balcony . <p> Pat yelled for his friend and his friend came , and of course there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the reputation of being crazy . <p> Every time Bodeau appeared he came closer . Pat moved on to another friend 's , and the very first morning he was getting ready to go to work , standing in front of a steamy bathroom mirror and combing his hair . As the steam cleared he saw Bodeau behind him . He staggered , turned and  --  nothing . Nothing was there . That night when Pat was under the covers with his new host , he woke up because his friend seemed to be breathing more noisily than usual . Pat reached out to touch him and he found , under the covers , a three-fingered hand . <p> Next thing he knew , Pat was running down Bourbon Street in his briefs in the rain while heavy feet smacked wetly on the pavement behind him . The barkers and the few people who were out obviously could n't see what was chasing him , they just yelled and whistled . I guess they thought Pat was advertising a gay bar or something . <p> Eventually he got back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend asked him what in the hell did he mean , jumping out of bed like that and running out into the rain ? <p> " One more bottle , " I suggested , fetching a decent Cabernet from a file drawer labeled INVOICES . Terry nodded thankfully . <p> " I have to admit your story is a lot more interesting than mine , " I told him . <p> " Thank you , " said Terry . He sniffed the wine and then went on : <p> AT TOLD ME that the thought of ultimately having to screw Bodeau was making all sex revolting to him . He said he was ready to enter a convent and take vows of chastity if only he would never have to submit to this creature . The trouble was , he did n't think Bodeau cared anything about convents and would come and abduct him and maybe take the Mother Superior , too , while he was at it . And what could he do ? <p> He started to cry , sitting on my couch with my two dogs looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and got myself all hot and bothered in the process , but whether he was merely having a violent stress reaction ( which I thought was about a ninety-nine percent possibility/ , or whether he had actually caught the eye of a three  --  toed , three-fingered Cajun demon ( one percent possibility ? / , I could n't offhand see anything to be done . Take him to a shrink ? Look for an exorcist ? <p> What I actually did was put him to bed , crawl in after him , and lie there quietly holding him with my five-fingered hands until he went to sleep . Which was quite a while . I stayed awake as long as I could and then I conked out , too . For a little over a week we lived together , and during that time I never laid a hand on him except to give comfort-I swear it . As for the pleasure of his company , well ... <p> Pat was , I think , the most ignorant boy I ever met . You could sit him in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show or wrestling ( for the tight pants ) or Geraldo . For music he liked heavy metal groups , especially Flesheater and Slash'n'Burn , which were big at the time . I bought him a Walkman and stuck the earphones in his ears , and he 'd sit there glassy-eyed , getting his young eardrums punctured , <p> He was pathetically amazed by ordinary pieces of information . He 'd never heard of income tax . He thought Europe was a northern state . He thought safe sex meant doing it with a guy who would n't beat hell out of you . The acme of grandeur he could imagine was taking a trip to Miami Beach . I told him he could go with me to Venice next summer on my regular holiday and stay at Daniele 's , and he looked disappointed but said hopefully , Maybe Miami some other time ? And I said , Yes , if you want to . Anywhere . <p> I 'd never felt like this before . Here this beautiful nineteen-year-old was in my grasp , and I was n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was caring for Pat , protecting him from demons either real or imaginary , and demanding nothing in return . This dumb kid from the . Projects had opened a window of generosity in my acquisitive lawyer 's heart and I loved him for it . <p> I would watch him sitting in the lamplight turning the pages of Gentlemen 's Attire , and he would look so little and helpless that my heart turned to Silly Putty inside me . Say , I hope I 'm not disgusting you , talking this way . <p> " No more than I 've disgusted myself on many occasions , " I said , refilling his glass . " It is a kind of madness , is n't it ? " <p> " You know it . But at the time it was more like a dream . Here I 'd done what I had hoped , I 'd found love in a bar . Sooner or later I believed Pat would get over his dementia or whatever , and he would kind of fold himself up and deposit himself in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I looking forward to the opening . <p> " Soon , I thought , we 'll be lovers in every sense and I 'll educate him , I 'll show him the world , I 'll dress him in every expensive overpleated garment in Gentleman 's Attire if he wants , and we 'll live and love and grow old together . God , I felt like I was living an E.M . Forster novel . " <p> He sighed . I was about to ask him what had gone wrong , but then I saw he was going to tell me anyway . So I shut up and waited . <p> Eight nights after I had found Pat in The Exile /Terry continued we were doing exactly what I 've described , sitting in my house peacefully , and every once in a while he would raise his head and gaze at me as if to be sure I was really there , and every time he did I would get the Silly Putty sensation again . And suddenly the dogs began to bark . <p> They were named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guys I found on the street panhandling for garbage and brought home partly out of compassion and partly for security . Well , they had always been good barkers , but right now they were outdoing themselves . They were standing just inside the front door and Punch was furious and Judy was hysterical . The only gun I had was a Ruger .22 , so I went and got it . Pat was staring in honor at the door and the dogs never shut up a second . I tried to put on my most John Wayne type of voice and yelled , Awright ! Who 's there , goddamn it ! <p> Then I got this funny feeling , this trembling in my breastbone . The sort of thing you feel when you 're waiting for a Mardi Gras parade and when it 's still a long way off your bones start to tremble to the reverberations of the bass drum . Then a sound began like an approaching jet that 's lost its way and grew to a hysterical roar that set the dishes tinkling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table and the pieces started to dance and the Black Queen fell over and then the White King . It was like living through the big one in Kobe . First Judy broke and ran and then Punch , both of them peeing on the floor as they went . The roar increased almost beyond bearing and then began to diminish as if an express train was roaring past . It passed through the rooms and faded and finally vanished . <p> I turned around slowly . A mirror on the wall was smashed . At first I thought it was because the sound had broken it , but later I realized that I had fired a .22 bullet into it without noticing what I was doing . The couch where Pat had been sitting was empty . I slowly walked through the rooms of my little house . Judy was hiding under the bed and Punch was backed into a corner , snarling and smelling like a glue pot . And aside from a couple pieces of broken glassware , that was all that was in the apartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the inside and there were bars on all the windows . I can tell you this - he did n't get out in any way known to science or to common sense . Yet he was gone . <p> After a little silence I felt I had to say something , so I said , " That 's quite a story . " <p> Terry replied , " That 's only the beginning . " <p> The next day , he went on , I reported Pat as a missing person and got the kind of reception from the cops you 'd expect . Fag 's boyfriend deserts him - big deal . <p> So I went looking for Skinny Minnie . I put on old ratty clothes and figured I 'd probably get hashed anyway in that neighborhood by the Projects , but nobody bothered me except a couple of panhandlers . I started going from bar to bar , ordering a beer in each , unless it was a black place in which case I backed out hurriedly . Pat had never said that Minny liked black guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted this little female with a spare tire around her middle . It was midafternoon , the time of serious drinking you might say , and she was alone except for the bartender , who was clearly bored by her conversation and moved on as soon as I joined her . <p> I 'll skip all the preliminaries . I verified that she had a son named Pat and I told her that I figured Bodeau had kidnapped him . She said , That prick . Turned out she meant Pat . She said , Why in hell do n't he get his own guys instead of stealing mine ? <p> She seemed really aggrieved . I asked if she knew where to find Bodeau . She made me buy her a Magnolia beer and a shot of Jack in the Black before she 'd answer . Then she said Bodeau was gone , that was all she knew , but he used to talk about his family who lived on the northshore . Family . That was a new one . I had been thinking of Bodeau as an isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of kinfolk living in the woods north of Lake Pontchartrain . I had a vague but truly scary vision of a sort of backwoods commune of horned three-coed monsters , and shivered . <p> Minny was watching me curiously and asked why I cared . I said well , I was worried about Pat , what Bodeau might do to him . She lost interest at once . Do n't worry about that little prick , she said , he 's been taking care of himself a long time . <p> I left as she was downing the shot of Jack . <p> Next I went to my office and started checking a northshore telephone directory . And my God , the Bodeaus . I mean , St. Tammany is n't a Cajun parish but lots of Cajuns live there and I counted more Bodeaus than Landrys or Rabalais or Sheksnaydres . They went from Bodeau , Alonso , to Bodeau , Zite . They lived on arteries like Rte. 1019 and Gray Moss Road , and I could just imagine the little narrow blacktop roads meandering through the pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music of northshore urban centers like Mandeville and Slidell . Then I had a thought and checked Bodo , and hell , there were three of them , too . And there was a Beaudeau , and even a Beauxdeaux , though that really seemed a kind of disgusting excess , even for a Frenchman . <p> They were listed in exchanges at Pearl River and Honey Island and Folsom and Little Bougfalaya . They were all over the goddamn place , up this little back road and that little back road , and the thing was , I could n't even be sure that the Bodeau I wanted was one of them . <p> Weapons . I was absolutely convinced of my inability to handle Bodeau in a fair fight , and the .22 was clearly insufficient , so I bought a snub nose .38 and a box of hollowpoints from a dealer I know . But I was still dissatisfied . Lawyers do n't like to shoot people , it seems unprofessional . Talking them to death is more our style , but I felt somehow that Bodeau was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really was a demon ? So I did what any sane , rational man of the late 20th century would do - I went to see a witch . <p> " A witch , " I said , with a certain skepticism in my voice . " You know a witch ? " <p> " You know Mamalou ? " Terry asked . <p> " Oh , the voodoo store , " I said . " Yeah , yeah . She 's a complete phony , you know . The only people she bewitches are tourists . " <p> " Maybe . But I 'd done some magic of my own with her taxes once , so I already had a connection . Are you sure you want to hear the rest of this ? I 'm drinking up all your wine . " <p> " Never did I spill wine for a better purpose , " I said , and Terry gave me a grateful smile and went on : <p> I went by her place one hot afternoon , and it had n't changed a bit since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like losses . The same New Orleans Saints T-shirts were displayed out front , and in the show window were the same disgusting postcards of naked fat people alongside fly-blown pralines and examples of what used to be called jim Crow art and is now known as Black Heritage art . I headed to the back , and there sat yellow-skinned Mamalou behind her counter with her dirty bottles of leaves and powder , varnished alligator heads and a collection of crystals glinting in what little light there was . <p> We said Hi and I gave her the outline of my problem - said my lover had been kidnapped by a rival and the cops were no help . <p> She gave me a piercing cook and said , Well I do n't guess you be a narc , Terry . Then she went behind a dusty curtain and brought back a little bottle and gave it to me , saying , You find a way to slip him this and he be out for two days . It 's bitter , she added , so put it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of fluid and said , What is this stuff ? A preparation made from mystic roots gathered in the dark of the moon ? Hell no , she said , it be good old fashion chloral hydrate and it will knock your enemy ass over teakettle , gare-on-teed . <p> So I bought that and then , after shuffling my feet , I told her the guy might be a demon , and what should I do if he was ? <p> She said , First gim me a round one . ( That must have done her heart good , after what I 'd charged her for my advice on taxes . ) So I gave her the hundred , and then she said , Bum him up , Terry . No other way . Knock him out and set fire to him . If he is what you say he will burn all up and nuttin ' will be left behind . <p> Hell of a position for an officer of the court to be in - burning people up . Even demons . <p> Next morning I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the World 's Longest Bridge , getting scareder and more depressed the further I went . I got off the interstate quick and spent that whole day driving up and down little tiny back roads and asking directions at service stations with hand-lettered signs that said Serve Yourself , Worms , and Gatorade . <p> I saw poor Bodeaus and comfortable Bodeaus , all kinds of Bodeaus . Their houses included everything from imitation Taras in the pines to dirty little shacks not much bigger than the Volkswagens disintegrating in the front yards . And every single person of that name , male and female , was an ordinary man , woman or child with four fingers and a thumb on each hand and no projecting tooth in the lower jaw . <p> To each one who would talk to me I said I was a lawyer looking for a guy named Bodeau in connection with a small legacy , and gave a brief description . And for three days every Bodeau , Bodo , Beaudeau and Beauxdeaux said they did n't know him . Guy like dat do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , No , Honey , I ai n't never see nobody look like what you just said , cher . <p> By the fourth day I had crossed every bloody Bodeau off my list except for one . At the house of Bodeau , Zite , the lady was out but a little girl with a very grown-up manner opened the door and when I described the-Bodeau <p> I was looking for she said , Thass Cousin X-avier . We do n't talk to him . Mama says he ai n't no good and if I ever see him coming up the front walk I should take her old thirty-ought-six and let him have it . <p> Oh , I said , my balls freezing , he 's kind of a black sheep , eh ? And the little girl said , No , he ai n't black , he 's kind of brownish and got fur . She closed the screen door and latched it and said , Ol ' X-avier lives on <p> Sam Boot Road and I do n't know where it 's at . As she disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone book ? Because my list did n't include a Bodeau , X. ) She said , Why would he have a phone ? Who would he talk to ? <p> So I set out to find Sam Boot Road , which was n't marked on the only large-scale map I 'd been able to find . God , did I waste gas . Up and down and all around . And the loafers and the women who take your credit card in the gas stations - you know the ones I mean ? The ones who know everything about their neighborhood , down to every local dog and the sex of its puppies ? None of them would admit to knowing where Sam Boot Road was , though one did say , Yeah , there 's a road by that name , just a tee  --  nine-sy li'l road , but where it 's at exactly I do n't know . <p> It was late afternoon and I had wasted a week in St. Tammany and found nothing . I was barreling along a blacktop highway past some pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had seen a dirty sign that said Sam Boot Road . I backed and turned and pretty soon I was deeper in shade than I 'd been all week . <p> I mean , the pines met over the road . It was like a tunnel . Not that there were n't signs of humanity around-garbage lying on the roadside , along with discarded plastic bottles and the remains of a butchered deer being munched by a skinny black wild dog . No horse farms on Sam Boot Road . No anything that I could see , except , nailed to a tree , a beat-up old sign that said PREPARE TO MEET . If it had once ended THY GOD , that part was gone . <p> Then the damn road dead-ended at another highway . However , I 'd noticed one little track turning off a ways back , so I drove back and parked and got out . The track was too narrow for a car , grown up with fat weeds and it vanished into the pines and thickets of cedar and wild holly . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the snub nose in my right pants pocket and wondering if I 'd ever have a chance to use the knockout stuff in my left . All around me was an ordinary Southern woodland , with bugs fiddling and clicking and so on . A big russet shadow drifted through the trees- an owl , I guess . Why he was awake at that time of day I do n't know . Then I saw a fallen-apart shed or chicken coop , and then a real log cabin beyond it - hand built , I mean , with a tin roof , not the kind you order precut in a kit from some outfit in California for $60,000 with optional hot tub . The cabin looked absolutely desolate just sitting there in the middle of a grassy clearing surrounded by old rusty iron things with spikes and cogs - agricultural implements , I guess - half swallowed by wild blackberry vines and honeysuckle . <p> I was standing in the trees , hesitating , not sure what to do next , when the cabin door opened and a squat figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guy put something under a flowerpot beside the door and then scratched his ass , scratched his head , adjusted his crotch , did all that personal stuff . At last he slouched away into the woods on the other side of the clearing . If that was Bodeau , he did n't look very impressive from a distance . I gave him a few minutes to get deep in the woods and then , taking a deep breath , I walked into the open and headed for the cabin . <p> Close up it still looked grim , but there were odd touches . A hummingbird feeder , for instance , with hummingbirds helicoptering around it . Wild azaleas growing as if somebody had transplanted them from the woods . Did n't seem demonic , somehow . I checked under the flowerpot , and sure enough , there was the key . I unlocked the door and gave it a shove . Oiled hinges ; no squeak . <p> I stepped inside and it was poor but neat , with rag rugs and furniture from Goodwill and a hand-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fridge and a sink . There was a steep staircase with treads but no risers , leading up to a loft . I climbed it , listening to the treads creak . I could see an unmade bed shoved back under the eaves . All of a sudden somebody snored . Christ , I almost wet my pants . <p> I crept like a little damn mouse up the last steps and looked over the edge of the bed . And just then Pat rolled over and opened his eyes . His blond hair was spiky from sleep and his eyes kind of gummy but his skin looked rosy and he seemed to be well . He had trouble focussing at first ; he peered the way people do when they 've just waked up , and then he recognized me and gave me a big smile of welcome . He kind of jingled when he moved and I sat down on the bed and hugged him . Without saying anything he pulled the sheet aside and showed me that he was chained to a big iron staple that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You okay , Pat ? And he said , Sure . I said , He has n't hurt you ? No , he said , Bodeau loves me , he would n't hurt me , and the sex has been terrific . I said kind of stupidly , You been eating okay ? And he said , Yeah , Bodeau makes great sauce piquante , too . <p> I was beginning to wonder what the hell I was doing there if things were so great when Pat burst into tears and said , Oh Terry , I 'm so glad to see you . I 'm sure sick of being penned up in this dump . I begun to think I never would get to Miami Beach at all . <p> So we fixed up what to do . I guess the proper move was for me to see the Sheriff of St. Tammany and tell him that a kidnapper was holding his victim on Sam Boot Road . Or just to shoot off the chain and find Pat a pair of pants to wear and clear out . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the night he disappeared from my house . <p> He said he was sitting there terrified , with the magazine still on his lap , when what felt like a tornado swept him up and flung him through the back wall so for an instant he saw the inside of the lathwork and roaches running in every direction . Then he was flying over Lake Pontchartrain in Bodeau 's arms , and down below he could see the lights glimmering along the causeway and the little winking lanterns of the fishing boats . And then down through the pines , the rough branches and the needles whipping him and then through the tin roof into the cabin . He felt strange , as if he was full of bubbles , like champagne , and then he seemed to solidify and Bodeau had him in his grasp and carried him up the steps to the loft for their first night together . <p> If there was anything to this account at all - and frankly , I did n't think Pat was smart enough to make it up - then sheriffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be captured , could n't be jailed , could n't be evaded . <p> Leaving Pat where he was , I climbed downstairs again and went to the fridge . Inside were a number of bowls neatly covered with plastic wrap . I found the sauce piquante ( which did smell great and emptied the chloral hydrate into it , stretched the plastic over it again , and put it back as exactly as I could . Then upstairs to commune with Pat again . <p> I asked him , Is Bodeau smart ? <p> Pat said , Not as smart as me . <p> That was the best news I 'd heard in a while . So I said , Well , when he gets back and starts fixing supper , you tell him you got an upset stomach tonight and can you have just something cool , like fruit or something . Do n't eat the sauce piquante . <p> Then I got the hell out . I went back to my car and drove it back to the highway with the horse farms , parked under a raintree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a demon ? Was the stuff Mamalou had sold me even what she said it was , or had she palmed off some tapwater on me ? I did n't know , and in a way I did n't care . If this plan was a washout I 'd try something else . I was by God determined that Bodeau would n't get to keep his prisoner , even if he did love him and /this was kind of galling ) the sex was terrific . <p> Seeing Pat chained to the wall had pissed me off , you know ? That was really uncouth . Even a demon ought to have a sense of , I do n't know , common decency . <p> So about dark I drove back , down Sam Boot Road and God , it was scary . That damn tunnel of trees . I mean , trees are all right in their place , but there 's some kind of atavistic fear connected with deep , dark woods at night and I was feeling it . I got out and started to walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop me from falling over stumps and clumps of invisible things that usually had thorns . I walked into trees . The last thing I walked into was the abandoned chicken coop , opening a cut on my forehead . And then I saw a light , and pretty soon I was standing on the edge of the woods looking at the cabin , with a steady white light that I figured was from a gasoline lantern streaming out of one window . <p> Okay . Time for Leatherstocking . I creep forward very , very slowly . Left foot , right foot , pause , inhale a couple of bugs , left foot , right foot . I creep around the mounds of decaying harrows and things . Something scuffles across my feet , I die a little , I decide it 's a possum . Find I actually have wet my pants . Tense . <p> Finally I reach the cabin . Light 's pouring out of the one window by the door . I 'm standing there , not quite tall enough to see in , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell are you ? <p> Right here ! I say , and he almost goes through the roof . <p> I slip inside . Bodeau 's lying sprawled half across the rustic table , sleeping noisily . I come up on him , trembling , and by God , he 's got three  --  fingered hands , just like Pat said . The love of my life was not smart enough to think up such an exotic lie . And one brown tooth really did stick up outside Bodeau 's mouth . Calling Phyllis Diller ! I must have spent a full minute just staring at this bizarre mutation and feeling , maybe for the first time since I realized-I was gay , that I belong to the majority after all . <p> Then Pat touched my shoulder and I came out of my trance . He was decently attired in jeans , T-shirt , and loafers . Obviously Bodeau only kept him chained and naked when he went out . Looking at my beauty I felt the first quiver of sympathy for Bodeau , obsessed with love or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And look where it had gotten him ! <p> Well , I did n't have any more time for introspection , so I said , Where 's the gasoline he uses for this lamps Pat brought it for me , the usual red can with a gooseneck , and I poured it all over Bodeau and the table . Pushing Pat ahead of me , I retreated to the door , holding the lantern , and then , swinging it over my head I smashed it down in the floor next to Bodeau . The flame hesitated for an instant - we were outside by now - and then it went whump and a blast of hot wind struck us from behind and pushed us onward . An instant later , as we were running across the clearing by the fire 's growing light , the window burst and the glass tinkled . <p> We stopped at the edge of the woods . It was a great bonfire , shooting up , engulfing the old dry wood of the cabin and lighting up the trees . The roar sounded like Bodeau coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owl , or another one , blundering away from the light . The cabin was gone in ten minutes and as it collapsed I could see that something at the heart of the fire was burning not red or yellow but white . Bodeau was burning , burning I hoped to nothing . Even twenty yards away the heat was intense . I saw the grass catch fire . The hummingbird feeder was gone and the wild azaleas looked like big burnt matchsticks . Nearby trees were beginning to catch in a crown fire . <p> I hustled Pat back along the track , found Sam Boot Road , and bundled him into my car . Neither one of us stopped shaking until we had passed the tollgate plaza and were back on the World 's Longest Bridge , with New Orleans glowing ahead , just over the horizon . <p> The wine was all gone . The rain had decreased to a mere sullen pitpat outside . I was drunk but still coherent , enthralled by the tale but , well , a mite dubious . There were a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . <p> " First , " I said , enumerating on my fingers , " was anything left of Bodeau when the fire was investigated , as I assume it was ? " <p> " Nothing . Not a bone , not a tooth . Whatever he was made of , it burned real hot and nothing was left , just like Mamalou had said . In fact , a fugitive warrant was issued for Bodeau on a charge of arson , for causing a minor forest fire . For all I know , they may still be hunting him . " <p> " Okay , " I said , going to the next finger , " second . Tell me this . What happened to Pat ? Why are n't you living with him at this minute ? Why five dogs instead of one guy ? " <p> " I took him to Miami Beach , " Terry sighed . " There was a rock concert there by Slash'n'Bum that he just had to attend , so I gave him the money to go while I stayed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat never came back . Later on I heard that he had joined the harem of the band 's drummer and was traveling the world as a groupie . Still later I heard that he had disappeared into the sexual underworld of Bangkok , where I 'm sure he 's surviving , as usual . At any rate , he 's finally seeing the world . " <p> " Third , " I said , and hesitated . " The girl I was telling you about , Willie . Her name was Wilhelmina , which could also be rendered as Minnie . And her lover , the burglar , he was so dumb and dumbness is sometimes hereditary , whatever Forrest Gump may say , and well - you do n't think - " <p> " No , " said Terry , drunkenly positive . " Too much of a coincidence . " <p> " You 're right . It 's ridiculous . " <p> " Absurd . Look , I did n't mean to get this deep into my sex life and I hope it wo n't make you lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See you again ? " <p> " You know it . You 're the only real friend I have . " <p> Wine talking , of course . Not the sort of truth I 'd ever tell while sober , that 's for sure . Terry hugged me and I hugged back , awkwardly . <p> Then Terry was outside , opening a big umbrella like a batwing . The whole Quarter was running water , torrents in the gutters , waterfalls spouting off the rooftops . He hesitated an instant before starting for home . <p> " You know , I still think about Bodeau sometimes , " he said . <p> " Qh , yeah ? " <p> " Yeah , the poor devil , " said Terry , and lurched into the night . <p> Author Affiliation
