America has a habit of " discovering " those extended comic books known as graphic novels every few years . It happened when Art Spiegelman published his shattering Holocaust comic Maus ( and won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for it ) . It happened again in 2000 , with the movie of Daniel Clowes ' alienation epic Ghost World . And now we 're coming back to the graphic novel yet again thanks to the film American Splendor , which is based on the autobiographical comic book by Harvey Pekar , who writes about life as a hard-luck , sad-sack , hospital file clerk in Cleveland , Ohio . He 's no superhero : the only flying he does is under the radar . <P> It 's easy to underestimate graphic novels  --  after all , they look just like their less evolved forebears , comic books , and if that 's not bad enough , they have been saddled with that awkward name . ( Maybe it would help if we called them tragic books ? ) They get sold in comic-book stores or shelved in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans , a place where self-respecting adult readers fear to tread . No wonder Pekar wrote American Splendor for 27 years before mainstream America finally took notice . The graphic-novel business is reportedly worth about $100 million a year , but it still has no honor in the country that invented it . Yet some of the most interesting , most daring , most heartbreaking art being created right now , of both the verbal and the visual varieties , is being published in graphic novels . These books take on memory , alienation , film noir , child abuse , life in postrevolutionary Iran and , of course , love , and they hit all the harder because we do n't expect wisdom and truth from characters who talk in speech bubbles . So go ahead . Read on , and discover the graphic novel all over again .  --  By Lev Grossman
