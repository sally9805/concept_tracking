CRESTONE , COLO.  --  Seemingly in the middle of nowhere , miles from the nearest major highway , this onetime Colorado gold-mining town seems like a most unexpected locale to find a growing religious center . But Crestone today boasts a denser concentration of high Tibetan lamas than normally would be found even in Tibet , and that 's just for starters . Christian Carmelites , Islamic Sufis , Jews , Hindus , Zen Buddhists , Taoists , Shintoists , and American Indians have all moved to Crestone . There is a story behind the formation of this eclectic community . Beginning in the late 1970s , a wealthy visionary named Hanne Strong , who with her husband , Maurice , owns 200,000 acres around Crestone , has donated land with the intention of creating a sanctuary for the world 's religions . The result has been remarkable , with diverse spiritual groups living in close proximity and intermingling . At the Christmas mass at the Roman Catholic monastery , whole rows get taken by Buddhist monks in their flowing robes .

Mixing it up . This exotic mlange exists amid an American western landscape straight out of Bonanza . When the first Tibetans arrived in Crestone around 1980 , the crusty old mayor was asked what he thought about it . " Better than a bunch of New Yorkers , " he replied . Now , a quarter century later , the area supports two distinct varieties of spiritual life  --  one traditional , the other free-form . Tibetan Buddhism scholar Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche finds that having so many living masters in residence makes the area now the world 's best place to practice and meditate . As one Crestone Buddhist , Erik Drew , puts it , " Why go to India and get dysentery ? You would never meet there such a concentration of first-rate teachers nor have such access to them .

And she begins her day thus heartened . Lorraine Fox Davis , an American Indian spokeswoman , observes that people change when they move to such a wintry , isolated natural setting . First , she says , residents must become more self-reliant here to survive and , since no one can make it alone , also become part of the community . Then , free of the hassles and stresses of urban life  --  in Crestone , house doors are left unlocked , car keys in the ignition  --  people invariably " soften . " And lastly , Davis says , everyone here feels a deep sense of connection to the land . A sense of connection between inner and outer landscape . Self-reliance . Community . The softening of the heart . These have always been the goals of a religious vocation . In Crestone , though , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clergy . Surrounded by 19 major religious groups , it 's the air even skeptics there breathe  --  this feeling of living in a larger universe . Rabbi David Cooper , author of the bestselling God Is a Verb , suggests that in Crestone is occurring a strange next step in human spirituality : " postreligion , " in which one can benefit from religion without being a believer/congregant . Fifty years ago , the eastern faiths that now populate the valley were all but unknown in America ; today , Cooper points out , their insights about compassion and mindfulness inform even the secular vocabulary in Crestone ( and elsewhere ) . Crestonians tend to treat one another well , recognizing not only what the other person is but also what he or she is striving to be . And that response helps bring , for the devout and nonbelievers alike , the ideal closer to actuality . " People who move to a place they consider " spiritual " behave differently , probably better , than they would elsewhere , " current Mayor Kizzen Laki observes .
