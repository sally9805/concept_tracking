<p> SURE , everyone loves the beautiful Texas countryside in spring . <p> But from atop a bike on a two-day ride to Austin ? <p> " When you tell people you 're going to ride 150-plus miles in two days , they think you 're crazy , " said Aaron Jacks , an MS 150 veteran and captain of the Houston-based Old School Cycling Team . " But it 's much more manageable than it sounds . " <p> If you 're considering participating in the 22nd annual BP MS 150 , a Houston-to-Austin ride April 22-23 that benefits the National Multiple Sclerosis Society , you 're in good company . <p> Although around 100 MS 150 rides take place nationwide each year , the local ride , which has 13,000 participants , is the largest in the nation . In fact , thanks in part to the donations it accumulates - last year 's participants raised $9.6 million - Texas ' Lone Star chapter is the largest fundraising chapter for the MS society in the country . <p> So it 's only natural you 'd want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If only it were n't for that pesky bicycling . And your pesky inexperience . <p> Do n't worry , said Chris Holmes , owner of Bicycle World and Fitness , 851 Dairy Ashford . Anyone can get ready . <p> " All of a sudden they 're going to use muscles they have n't used before . Their butt 's going to hurt , their body 's going to ache a little bit , " he said . " It is something that you 've got to put a little effort into , but if you do that , the rewards are incredible . " <p> After obtaining the right equipment , Holmes said , the keys are training consistently and finding others to ride with . <p> " Before , after the MS 150 , everybody put their bikes up , " he said . " Now , really year-round , Houston 's a great city for riding . " <p> He said that while the idea of riding from Tully Stadium in Houston or Rhodes Stadium in Katy to Austin - the routes cover more than 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also a great way to meet people . <p> " People get a little intimidated because there 's 13,000 people , but if you 're not liking riding next to somebody , speed up or slow down - there 's somebody else you can ride with . People are super friendly . " <p> Hunter Jaggard , team captain of the Carney Men , an MS 150 team planning to raise $50,000 for the society this year , said camaraderie is very important for his team , which gathers for beers and barbecues after training rides and waits until all team members have arrived to cross the finish line in Austin as a group . <p> He added , though , that the most important part of the ride is the cause , as at least a third of the team knows someone or has a family member with MS , a chronic disease that affects the brain and spinal cord and typically strikes adults between ages 20 and 50 . <p> " We 're going to ride until we do n't have to ride this thing anymore , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Jacks said that since his mom was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2004 , the ride has taken on a new meaning . <p> " A lot of people , when they do it the first time , it is about fitness or the challenge , but when you actually know why you 're doing it , it means a lot more , " Jacks said . " It 's definitely personal for me . " <p> He said people without a direct tie to MS can be matched with a " pedal partner , " a person with MS who they remember throughout the ride . He said riders carry red bandannas signed by their pedal partner for inspiration . <p> " If you feel like you ca n't do it any more , you look down and see the bandanna , " he said . <p> The best part , he added , is when the riders get to downtown Austin . <p> " When you get near the Capitol , you hear the crowd , and when you turn onto MLK there are 4,000 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the moment of the tour . It 's powerful . " <p> Herb Feins , lead instructor for Cyclefit Houston , which offers cyclists classes about training , safety and nutrition , urged beginners to ask questions and seek help from veterans when needed . <p> " They get very intimidated because they do n't know where to ride , " Feins said . " No one tells them what to do . They do n't know where to go . That 's a problem . I 've been there . " <p> He said classes like those offered by Cyclefit Houston and at local bike shops can make a big difference in training and confidence , adding that persistence is key . <p> " It 's gradual , but like anything that you do over a long period of time , you 're going to get better at it , " he said . " They 've got to dedicate the time and they 've got to plan to get ready for the MS 150 . We 'd love to have them . " <p> The equipment <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grueling two-day event that is best done with the right gear . <p> Cycling shoes <p> Clipless pedals and attachable shoes increase your speed and power by stabilizing your feet and preventing them from flexing downward . <p> Cost : About $50 to install the pedals ; about $90 for the shoes <p> Try : Pedals vary depending on the store ; Shimano M120s for shoes <p> Repair kit <p> In case of flat tires or minor mechanical problems , assemble a repair kit with a spare tube , tire levers , an inflater and a multitool . Do n't forget a bag to hold it all . <p> Cost : About $80 <p> Water bottle holders <p> Some bikes come with these , but if not , ask a bike shop to install one for you . <p> Cost : $5-$10 <p> Helmet <p> Look for a helmet with vents and a visor to keep you cool and a locking system that will hold it on your head . Ask for instructions about adjusting it properly . Anything older than five years needs to be replaced . <p> Cost : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road bike <p> The lightest , most effective way to ride the MS 150 is on a road bike . Ask your bike store to fit the bike to you to prevent injuries that can occur if your bike is n't adjusted for your body type . <p> Cost : Starting at $600 <p> Try : The Giant OCR 3 <p> Cycling shorts <p> Because you 'll spend so much time on the road , padded cycling shorts are necessary to wick away sweat and prevent chaffing . <p> Cost : Around $50 <p> Try : Pearl Izumi Tri Short , in men 's and women 's <p> Also recommended <p> Padded gloves , a jersey , a floor pump for inflating tires and a bicycle mirror that mounts on handlebars . <p> ABOUT THE MS 150 <p> What : The MS 150 is the largest organized cycling event in the country , with 100 rides in 48 states annually .

A sample schedule might be : <p> Monday : 30-45 minute ride with hills <p> Tuesday : 30-60 minute interval training or spin class <p> Wednesday : rest <p> Thursday : 60-minute ride , with 30 minutes pedaling hard <p> Friday : Cross training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around an hour and 30 minutes or 15 miles <p> Sunday : rest <p> Once you have a schedule you 're comfortable with , gradually increase your weekly time or distance by 10 percent to 15 percent . By the time of the MS 150 , you 'll want to have gone on a 65-70-mile ride . <p> Spin classes are great for variation , or when weather makes cycling outside undesirable . However , so that you 'll have practice with hills and various road conditions , limit stationary bike workouts to one or two a week . <p> The MS 150 lists recommended training rides on its Web site at www.ms150.org ( click on " Riding " ) . Consider these your " long ride " days to help break up the monotony and give you practice riding in groups . <p> Keep your energy up during rides by drinking plenty of water and eating snacks like energy bars on long rides . Also , consider taking a safety course to prepare to ride in such a large event . <p> Consider using a training log to record distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress will keep you motivated . <p> For riding tips , places to ride and people to ride with , visit a local bike shop , which has the best information about riding in your area . <p> NOTES : kristin.finan@chron.com 1 .

TAYLOR JONES @x Those Immortal Chaplains I can not believe that in the article on military chaplaincy by John J. McLain , SJ . ( " Showing God 's Face on the Battlefield , " 1 1/17 ) , you did not tell the story behind the picture of that famous postage stamp which you used to illustrate the article ; surely not every reader will recognize it .

Kristeen Bruun North Richland Hills , Tex . Animal Liberation Re your item on ecology , " Do Rocks Have Rights ? " ( Current Comment , 11/10 ) : Can animals have rights ? That depends on what is meant by a " right . " Many animals have legal protection , as do many of us who are in no position to secure it on our own . Courses on animal law pull together a body of law that has been developing since the early 19th century . It is not new law . Further , animal law does not have to do with the concerns of environmental law . Its ultimate focus has always been on animals as individuals , not fungible , that can suffer and may have independent interests of their own , in contrast with the focus in environmental law on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esq . Ann Arbor , Mich . Paul 's World Thank you for publishing the articles on St Paul 's life , the society around him and its influence on his writings ( " The Legacy of St Paul , " 1 1/10 ) . As a reader and lector who sometimes struggles to bring life and emotion to the Sunday readings , I found the articles put Paul 's words into a context that will help me ( and others , I hope ) breathe energy and emotion into his works as they are read aloud . Such articles help us to appreciate the rich context of our Scriptural readings . Frank Sturm Dumfries , Va . Intelligent Designs The book review by William Reiser , SJ. , of Ancestral Grace , by Diarmuid O'Murchu , M.S.C. ( " ' And the Word Became Primate ' ? " 11/10 ) , reminded me of the great theologian Thomas Aquinas , who embraced the best " science " of his day , rethinking Christian doctrine with the thought of Aristode as a background . In die short run , he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run , however , the believing community was gready enriched because of what he did . The best science of our modern time is evolutionary science . Those who take the 13.7 billion-year story of the unfolding of the universe as a starting point for theological reflection see it as God 's primordial and foundational revelation . It is a story that suggests new images and metaphors for the divine . Thinkers of the 21st-century , including theologians like Father Reiser and social scientists like Father O'Murchu , are invited to engage this new hermeneutic creatively . They can expect considerable tension between resulting insights and more familiar traditional teachings . Over time , however , they can expect their own lives and those of the believing community will be enriched . John Surette , SJ . La Grange Park , III . Anarchy In " A Past Without a Future ?

If we accept Senator Biden 's stance on abortion , where do we stand on issues such as torture , help for the poor and the environment ?

Shoulder to Shoulder Leaving the moral argument aside , your editorial on refugees ( " A Refugee World , " 11/3 ) is an exercise in navet . The United States can not take in all the people in the world who would like to come here , because that would be ecologically and economically impossible , even before our current financial meltdown . Some well-meaning Christians , it seems , will not be satisfied until we are all living shoulder to shoulder in beehive housing complexes and when open spaces are distant memories .

Divine Love I found " Dragen , Here Is Your Letter , " by Lyn Burr Brignoli ( 1 1/27 ) , very moving , but was touched even more by Brignoli 's religious experience and her ability to reflect on it in true Ignatian fashion . She moves from an " abstract God " to a " deeper experience of God beyond mere logic , " then starts " to transcend the boundaries of doctrine and enter into the heart of God " and finally " to catch a glimpse of the compassion of God . " I am an 87-year-old Jesuit who has been blessed with ministry in spiritual direction and retreats , and found this story to be a wonderful reflection on the experience of God revealing himself and befriending us .
