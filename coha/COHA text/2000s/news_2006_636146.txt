<p> Former DePaul basketball player Latasha Byears described herself as a bleeping piece of work " and a bleeping Mozart " in an article published in the <p> July 2003 issue of GQ magazine . And she was just warming up . <p> They got the wrong idea about me , " Byears , then with the WNBA 's Los Angeles Sparks , told writer Robert Draper . They do n't know where I came from , and they could n't live a day in my shoes . You know what my attitude is ? Bleep the world . I 'm a winner , man . I 've been a winner from day one . It 's rough and tough . I rock brave with my Afro puffs . Rock on wit yo ' bad self . This game , it 's physical out there , man . If you 're a pretty girl , do your mascara before the game , because you ai n't gon na make it long in this league , babe . " <p> The article , titled Beauty in the Beast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodman wannabe , with an appetite for booze , tattoos and mayhem . And it did n't sound like a stretch . <p> Trust me , I 'm gon na be a millionaire someday , " Byears said . Man , I 'm gon na buy my mama the biggest house in the world . And I 'm gon na open me a restaurant or a nightclub . Whether it 's a strip club or a gay club , I do n't give a damn . Where I can drink my apple martinis ... " <p> At the time , Byears ' WNBA rap sheet included a one-game suspension for a 2001 DUI arrest and a two-game suspension for throwing a basketball in the face of an opposing player from close range . But these incidents paled compared to what came next . By the time the GQ article hit newsstands late in June , Byears had been kicked out of the league amid allegations that she had sexually assaulted a former teammate . <p> According to published reports , Byears and three men were accused of raping a woman at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on June 5 , 2003 . Although a police investigation ensued , no charges were filed and the case was closed in July 2005 . ( Reportedly , the alleged victim , a foreigner , never filed a complaint and left the country shortly after the alleged incident . ) But the Sparks did n't wait to learn the outcome of the police investigation , choosing instead to waive Byears five days after the alleged incident . And even though Byears was among the best power forwards in the league , no other WNBA team picked her up . It seems that Byears , who 's brash and burly and , perhaps incidentally , openly gay , did not fit the image the family-friendly WNBA created for itself . <p> Did the GQ article have something to do with it ? " DePaul coach Doug Bruno said . I do n't know . She was trying to create a persona . She represented the hip-hop aspects of basketball , which is a very positive and different aspect of the sport . She came off as the female Allen Iverson . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative or positive . " <p> Because Byears was not a marquee player and the league struggles for media coverage , the issue of her release nearly went quietly away . But when Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant was arrested less than a month later on suspicion of rape and later charged with felony sexual assault , Byears paid attention . The Lakers did n't release Bryant . They did n't even suspend Bryant . To the contrary , the Lakers , who own the Sparks , offered Bryant their full support throughout his long legal battle , going so far as to fly Bryant to Colorado for court appearances to make things easier for him . And NBA commissioner David Stern backed Bryant 's right to continue playing despite the criminal charge against him . <p> If every time someone was accused and there were allegations they were required to stop their life , that would n't be a good thing , " Stern said . <p> The disparity in treatment between Bryant and Byears could not have been more glaring . Byears sued the Lakers in 2004 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual orientation . Meanwhile , the WNBA continued to want no part of her . <p> Maybe they 're scared of me because I 'm gay , " Byears told the Los Angeles Times Magazine in 2005 . Maybe it 's just because I 'm outspoken , and I love women . " <p> Byears and the Lakers reached an out-of-court settlement in February 2006 that precludes her from talking about her release from the Sparks . But Byears , who could not be reached for this story , succinctly summed up her feelings about the situation to ESPN , saying , Innocent until proven guilty ? I think that 's only for certain people . " <p> Shortly after her lawsuit was settled , the WNBA lifted its Byears embargo , and Byears , now 32 , returned to the court with the Washington Mystics this season . She 'll be back in Chicago tonight when the Sky hosts the Mystics at the UIC Pavilion . Bruno , one of her biggest fans , plans to attend the game . <p> Obviously , she 's a strong woman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a situation of pure accusation and innuendo . But while she 's a tough person outside , inside she 's daddy 's little girl  --  me being her daddy . She used to tease me , saying , Daddy 's little girls are always the kids that do everything right and perfect . ' And I 'd say to her , You 're daddy 's little girl . " ' <p> Byears , who grew up in Millington , Tenn. , played two seasons for Bruno after transferring from Northeastern Oklahoma A &M.; Bruno was among the first persons she called when the assault allegations arose . <p> She explained that nothing had happened , and she was adamant about that , " Bruno said . But the coach in me came out . I lectured her . I said , Latasha , I believe you , but why have the party ? Why put yourself in a position to be judged ? ' We used to talk about that all the time at DePaul . You 're going to have to represent the league . At certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " <p> Despite being a first-team All-America selection her senior year in 1996 , Byears was overlooked in the WNBA 's inaugural draft in 1997 . Bruno , who also works as a consultant for the Sky , could not hazard a guess as to why Byears went undrafted . He knows only that she was an outstanding player and teammate at DePaul . <p> She was a great rebounder , " he said . As a player , she never once asked to have the basketball . She was a classic player . She said , I 'll go get the ball . No one has to run a play for me . ' She was a very smart player . She understood that this game is filled with people going to the Hall of Fame who miss half their shots . She figured , I 'll go get those missed shots . " ' <p> Byears ultimately signed with the Sacramento Monarchs and played four seasons there before being traded to the Sparks after the 2000 season . With Byears taking care of the boards and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-to-back titles in 2001 and ' 02 . <p> She was one of the most committed players on the team and a big reason we won it all , " former Sparks coach Michael Cooper told the Los Angeles Times Magazine . She was just huge for us , nasty and tough on the inside . " <p> Byears had only minor disciplinary issues at DePaul , including a one-game suspension  --  coach 's decision  --  for trash talking , and Bruno described her relationship with her teammates as solid . It did n't surprise Bruno that many of Byears ' Sparks teammates , including Leslie , came to her defense when she was waived . <p> Tasha had an edge , but people assume an edge is negative , " Bruno said . She 's one of the most special people I 've ever coached  --  and one of the most talented . And her talent goes way beyond basketball talent . She has a wit to her . She could be sitting on a bus , talking about race relations in America , and she 's unbelievably funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while in her own way she was preaching a parable . " <p> Shunned no longer , Byears appears to be preaching a new parable since returning to the WNBA . <p> I 'm more mature now ... all that stuff is out of my system , " she told ESPN . That was the old Latasha Byears .
