I wanted to thank you for an article that was not a Jon or Kate bashing . I have watched their show since the beginning .

Margaret Dykes Pittsburgh , Pa . ANIMALS AND AUTISM Kristen Rader of Salem , Ore. , was moved when she read our story on how horses helped Rowan Isaacson with his autism . " It gave us hope , " she says . Rader 's son Brandon , 5 , has autism and , like the Isaacsons , Rader and her husband , Brian , have turned to animals as a way to reach their child .
