Usnavys <p> so , you know I 'm not a hoochie , okay ? But an unhappy marriage can make a woman do questionable things . Things she 's not proud of , things she only tells her closest friends  --  and even then with the understanding that , if they blab about it , they 'll get their butts kicked . So it is , m'ija , that I am cheating on my husband at a big adobe resort outside Santa Fe , New Mexico . I have never cheated on him before , and I 'm not sure I 'll do it again . Alls I knew was I had to do it just this once . <p> My college friends , the sucias who 've been my support network for fifteen years  --  since we met as freshmen at Boston University  --  will arrive here in a few days for our annual vacation trip , a tradition we started two years ago . Me , though ? I flew here from Boston yesterday to take care of some personal business . A seven-year-itch kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of it . I decided I 'd seduce the golf pro after I saw his photo in the brochure for the resort . I learned what I could about him , and I concocted my strategy . It worked . <p> My husband , Juan ? He 'd looked up at me through his smudgy Clark Kent eyeglasses over the morning paper across the breakfast table before I left yesterday , his curly black hair sticking up all greasy wherever it was n't receding . " Why are you going early , mi reina ? " he wanted to know . Reina means queen , and to him , I 'm still an empress . He does n't know about the golf pro , and I do n't think you should tell him , either . <p> I told Juan I wanted to get to the resort early , to observe some outreach programs having to do with Latinas and AIDS in New Mexico , for my work as an executive with the United Way of Massachusetts Bay . It sounded very official when I said it , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very successful , " I assured him , with a wave of my hand . " It 's a model that might be emulated here in New England . " <p> He believed me , el pobre . He thinks marriage changed me . For a while I did change , too , but now I know better . Listen to me . After ten years of juggling no less than two men at a time , a woman does not just up and change , even though God and the world know there 's a piece of paper and shared taxes involved now . I am a " manizer " the same way my daddy was a womanizer . I was to the manor born , as the americanos say , and , even though I 'm not proud of it , I seem to have stayed the way he met me . <p> Juan thinks I 'm different because he chooses to see the best in people , even when it is n't there . His heart hallucinates . I know , you think that 's a plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan . But nena , that 's just it . Juan believes everyone and he does it indiscriminately . Ai n't no backbone in that . The boy is nanve . Back when he had him a job ( ahem ) , he believed all them drug addicts when they told him they were clean and sober as an Osmond now , he believed them when they said they were going to get jobs and stop doing shit like stealing cars . Then he acted all surprised when they came crawling back into rehab after getting arrested for crime and crack again . I try telling him , people do n't change that much , m'ijo , no matter how bad you want them to . Badly . Yes , I know the difference between good and bad grammar ; no , I do n't give a rat 's ass . Whatever , no ? <p> This resort is supposed to look like a Pueblo Indian village , like in those Georgia O'Keeffe paintings , where the pastel flower petals look all coochie unfurling in their glistening glory . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacked on top of each other , or like a dusty old stack of wedding cake . Depends on your attitude . At the moment , I 've chosen candy over cake . <p> Chocolate , to be exact . <p> His name is Marcus Williams , and he 's the golf pro  --  like an older , darker Tiger Woods in his crisp white polo shirt and khaki shorts , with that salt-and-pepper hair and that little sexy mustache . He 's probably forty-five or so , but he 's got him some deltoids like cantaloupes . You do n't think you 're going to find a fine black brother teaching golf up on an Indian reservation near Santa Fe , nena , but life is full of delicious surprises , +sf ? From what I read about him , I know that Marcus used to be a professional golfer . He retired and came to work here in New Mexico because he likes the desert but dislikes Arizona 's take on black people . I 've seen his car , and it 's a white Cadillac , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the days when he almost won the U.S. Open and Nike came knocking on his door . I learned all this about him on the Internet , following his comments on message boards and things like that . I plan my attacks like an army general , always have . <p> I should tell you , Juan do n't play golf . Does n't . He does n't play golf . Dominos , yes ; golf , no . Nintendo , yes ; skiing , no . I try telling him , you will never get ahead in business inviting CEOs to play dominos , nene , but he 's like , " I do n't want to play anything with CEOs except Revolution , I want to play with my tfo and my sobrino and the people I actually like . " Whatever . <p> All my life I dreamed that I 'd marry the kind of man who played him some golf , and liked to ski and went to places like Jackson Hole , okay ? I imagined it , and it felt good . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Marcus or any nonsense like that , I 'm just saying Marcus plays golf and Juan does n't . Marcus has a Cadillac and Juan does n't . Marcus wears polo shirts , Juan does not . I 'm just saying that sometimes you have things in your head a certain way and life spins you a different way , and you still wonder about that road not taken , only my road not taken is more like a little path for golf carts . I like Marcus , and I wonder , you know , if I 'd married me someone like that , would I still be struggling to pay the Bloomingdale 's charge on time . I wonder if I 'd still be choosing to go to fancy dinners for work alone because I ca n't bear the sight of my husband in his Che Guevara T-shirt and tuxedo jacket sitting next to me . I am a woman of class and substance , and I 'd like to imagine what it would be like to be married to a man of class and substance , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sue me . <p> Oh , and the best part ? Marcus likes me back . I knew he would , though , and not just because he said my Boston accent was cute . It 's because I look good and I smell good and I 'm full of compliments of the type and caliber that make a man feel important . That 's all . Oh , and he likes some big thighs , know what I 'm sayin ' ? You know how black men feel about curvy women of a generous size and proportions . Uh- huh . He gave me a lesson this morning , wrapping his big old arms around me to show me how to swing , holding me so close I could smell the manly spice of his deodorant and the heat of the sun on his clean cotton clothes . He eased his hand over mine and whispered in my ear , " Do n't swing carelessly , Usnavys , do n't lose focus on your game , girl . " <p> I could have taken him right then , okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how bad he wanted me . But I had lunch to attend to in the resort cafT . Some things are better if you have to wait for them  --  including me . I sat outside , behind my big sunglasses with the golden dior on the sides , with a view of the kiva-shaped pool and the jagged plum-colored mountains , with my copy of Oprah and Gourmet to keep me company . I started with some baby pork ribs marinated in red chile and hoisin sauce , with a side of rainbow-striped designer coleslaw with black seeds in it . To drink , I had sparkling water with a twist of lemon , and a sweet white zinfandel . Then , because I knew I 'd need some energy for the afternoon , I had the leg of lamb , marinated in garlic sage oil . There was polenta on the side , which is really grits but nobody around here is going to tell you that , baby , with tomatoes and pine nuts all sprinkled up on it . They say pine nuts are the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nut world , because it 's so damn hard to get them out of the pine cones . I had a local red wine with the main meal . Even though I am not big on drinking so much in the middle of the day , I knew I might need to drift away a little bit because of what was coming . There was something else I wanted to tell you . What was it ? Oh , right , m'ija . The rest of the meal . What was the side dish ? I remember now . You would have died , girl . It was sautTed vegetables , which ordinarily would not sit well with me because I do not do vegetables , but they were tossed with a pecan demi-glace and mint . It was so good I almost decided not to go for dessert , but when I saw the light , simple strawberry cheesecake , I could not refuse . <p> Same goes for Marcus . Look at him . Look at him . You know what I 'm saying . <p> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are you crazy , girl ? He does n't need to know . Four years married . I 'm not trying to hurt Juan , the main man in my life since high school . Seriously . He 's good enough at doing that all by himself , okay ? He started that masochistic trend by not having him a real job , with real pay . He made it worse by deciding he wanted to quit his job as the director of a rehab center for Latino men to be a " stay-at-home papi . " Because I , an executive with style and grace , made three times his salary . We agreed we did n't want a nanny raising our Carolina , because I can tell you from personal experience , that whole nanny thing is for people who care more about their dogs than their children . I always thought it would be me at home with the kid , not him . He 's all , " Go ahead and stay home , but we 'll have to downgrade a few things on my salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't about to go back to a backfiring Neon with a dragging tailpipe . So here we are . <p> Pero , Mister Mom , how joto , no ? I do n't care how good he is with her . Watching Juan answer questions from Dora the Explorer with our daughter does n't exactly make me lustful for him . Dora 's all , " Do you see a monkey ? " and Juan 's like , " Right there , Dora ! " Pointing his finger and shit . I ca n't stand that show . That Dora girl , and Diego too , they sound like they been drinking lead paint . I appreciate my husband . I do . Seriously . I just do n't want him . He might as well dress his hairy ass up like a French maid , m'ija . That 's how much he 's turning me on lately . <p> I know kids need their parents to stay together and all that . I mean , I thought that was basically true , until I heard some guy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say squat about monogamous marriages , and how David in the Bible had him seven hundred wives and how up until three hundred years ago , polygamy was the damn norm for most of the world . I did n't believe it , and went and looked it up , and saw that it was true . All these " family values " people who thump the Bible around do n't even know what they 're thumping , that there was lots of humping going on in that book . That made me think . Lots of things do . <p> God knows I do n't want to hurt our daughter ( even if she does act like a filthy little tomboy ) , but I was raised to want a real man , a man 's man , and right now I ca n't believe my stay-at-home floj=n fits that description . Anyway , he 's too tired to seduce me anymore , right ? Girls like me ? We 're raised to be conquered by our men , okay ? That 's the verb we use for seduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With his dishpan hands and aching back , Juan does n't have the strength to conquistarme . It 's sad . <p> Do n't get all preachy with me about this , either . Listen . Tell me , nena , do real men make their grandmama 's sancocho recipe from memory , cracking the corn cobs in half like a practiced campesina , with their favorite daytime talk show playing on the kitchen flat-screen ? Do real men call abuelita in Bayam=n to ask her the best way to mash the tostones , all the while licking yellow cupcake batter from the wooden spoon out of the pink Williams-Sonoma bowl I bought myself for Easter last year ? Cupcakes he takes to Carolina 's exclusive preschool for her snack day , while I 'm slaving away at the office in a pants suit ? Tell me . Do n't be shy now . I 'd like to know . Do they ? Bueno . <p> Mira , I know it 's retro , the way I 'm thinking and so on and so forth . But I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not tell a mentirita . Okay ? It 's that simple . It 's like this : With the way my family goes on about it , like when my mami clicks her tongue like a chicken and says how disappointed she is I could n't do better than some masculine moocher , I feel like he 's taken my womanhood from me , like he done gone and cut my uterus out with pinking shears . <p> Marcus , when I invited him up at the end of the golf lesson , lifted his big mirrored aviator sunglasses and watched me walk all the way across the putting green to the clubhouse in the bright white sunshine , a smile of scandal and surprise in his wide-set , honey-colored eyes . I was all , swish-to-the-left , swish-to-the-right , and I wore me a pretty pink golf skirt , okay ? Not wide-ass khaki shorts like all the other women with their flat butts . Those women look like they 're about to wrestle a crocodile down or something , girl . Not me . I wore me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they was one of them golden pocket-watches German hypnotists pendulum around when they say " you 're getting sleepy . " My body is mad hypnotic , right ? Five four , a size twenty curved up in all the right places , thirty-three years old , and men still be begging me for a piece , okay ? You know I got it like that , girl . You know I do . I take good care of myself , that 's all . <p> Five minutes ago , at two in the afternoon on the dot , Marcus knocked on the door to my mountain-view suite and I , wearing only my black lace body stocking , shiny black do-me pumps , a three-strand pearl choker , and the hotel-issue robe , answered . I do n't wear a body stocking because I 'm embarrassed of my size or anything like that . It 's just nice to have something holding me all in place . After having a baby , things jiggle-wiggle a little more than a girl is used to , and this way I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds of his nervous small talk for the thick white robe to slip off . <p> Whoops . <p> So there I was , all curves and soft brown skin . I have to tell you , I have gotten sexually bold in my thirties . If you 're a modern Latina , I swear it 's like you spend your whole twenties working like loca to get over your Catholic guilt at being sexual at all , just so you can be a vixen in your thirties . Marcus whispered " whoa , " and stuttered after that , wanted to ask me what I did for a living , what brought me to the resort , what city I lived in , and all that kind of nonsense , but I shut him up quick . " I do n't know you , Marcus , " I said , handing him a cherry-flavored condom as I draped myself across the big bed with its earth-tone Southwestern bedspread , " and you do n't know me . Let 's keep it that way for now , nene , +'ta bien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , " What 's a fine African-American woman doing talking Mexican ? " and it was all I could do not to turn him around and drop-kick his ass back to the clubhouse , okay ? <p> " For your information , I am Puerto Rican , " I told him , pointing to my luscious neck with my French acrylic tips . " And the language you heard was Spanish . Ai n't nobody in the world speak no Mexican , okay ? Mexican ? That 's not a language , now shut your mouth before you start to look ugly to me , and let 's do this thing . " <p> I had to pull him to me after that , not because he did n't want none of mama 's island papaya pie , but rather because he was all human popsicle in shock , like he could n't move . Men dream about women doing this kind of thing to them all the time , but there are n't many mujeres who can pull it off , you know what I mean ? So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A practiced campesina like my girly husband has become coulda broke that boy in half with her bare hands . <p> Now , here we are , ten minutes into it , and Marcus has apologized for his ignorance about Spanish . " I am sorry . That was very uncouth of me . You would n't know I went to Yale talking like that , I suppose , " he said , and I was all , " Yale ? " and he said , " Yeah , I have a law degree that I do n't use anymore , " and that 's when he told me he was a widower whose wife used to be an attorney , and that he 's actually quite well-off and only does the golf pro thing because he loves golf and needs to be around people so he does n't go crazy . <p> That last bit made me have to respect him , m'ija , and even though I do n't want to , I am now seeing him as more than a piece of ass . Now he looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , my husband Juan ? Soon as that boy sees we 've got enough money , he quits his job and stays home . But not Marcus . Marcus has enough to retire on and live comfortably , but he would rather work because he takes pride in work and likes it . Why did n't I marry me a man like this , girl ? That 's what I want to know . Why did I think Juan would shape up just because I bought him some nice shirts ? Life does n't work like that , and now it 's too late . Or not . I do n't know . You make your own life , and it ai n't over until it 's over . <p> I push the possibility of falling for Marcus out of my mind and focus on the task at hand , even though if I 'm honest I 'd say he looks a lot better now that I know he 's a man of means and substance . He 's gotten over his stage fright nicely now , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was worried he 'd be wooden about this , but he is n't . He 's all down on his knees at the edge of the bed , his oval face all up in my cocoa-puff , nosing around like a pig in truffles . And if you were to bottle it , I bet it 'd cost like truffles , too . I 'm that good . <p> He 's making satisfied sniffles and there 's the sloppy wet sound I have n't heard in a while . It has been . Too long . Okay ? Something happens when you have a baby , nena , and it has nothing to do with your body . It 's all flat psychological . You and your husband ? You get so tired from the whole thing , all the up and down all night with the baby , all the fights over whose turn it is to change the diapers or warm up the bottle , all the arguments about the best way to do this or that , that you just lose interest in each other like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? I just lost interest in sex with my husband . It 's been three months since Juan and I knocked the booties , and I would n't care if we went another three years , I really would n't . <p> " A little more to the front , " I tell Marcus . He follows instructions and , oh my goodness , girl , gets a bull's-eye . Juan , though ? Please , girl . The one time I tried to suggest he do it differently , three months ago on a night when I worked late and got home in need of loving , he sighed and looked all beleaguered , wiped his mouth on the back of his soggy gorilla hand like I made him tired , and whined , " Do I have to ? " <p> What is that shit , m'ija ? " Do I have to ? " Please , psh . How can you get busy with a man who asks you something nonsensical like that ? I was all , " If there 's something you 'd rather be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " I closed my legs to him then , and I have n't had the urge to open them to him again . It 's not entirely my fault that I 've wandered down the path to Marcus . It 's Juan 's fault , too , for not trying harder to keep me interested . <p> " Asf , papito , " I call to Marcus as I run my hands over his short , kinky hair . <p> " I 'll assume that means ' yes , Daddy , ' in Puerto Rican Spanish , " he mumbles . <p> " It means ' like that , Daddy , ' " I correct him . He smiles up at me as he tweaks my nipple with one hand , and I feel like I 'm on fire . <p> I read one time that some marriages need affairs , because they reignite the flames that went out between husband and wife . Honestly ? I love my husband because he 's the only fool who completely understands where I come from . I do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , because he 's one too . I 'm hoping that 's what happens here , okay ? That I can take these flames that this golf pro man has fired up in me and keep them lit up like the Olympic torch until I get home . <p> " I want to be inside you , " he mumbles , twisting out of his polo shirt , coming up toward me all sculpted muscle . He 's removing the golf pro shorts , and mama is pleased to see his club 's nothing less than a seven iron . <p> " What a boy wants , a boy gets . " I arrange myself for easy access . " Gim me that putter , baby . Sink it in the hole . " <p> " More like a driver , but who 's going to quibble over semantics at a moment like this ? " he asks as he slides in with a groan , and tells me how warm and soft it is . Like I did n't know . I 'm pure melted butter , nena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a sweet smile on his face . I do n't mean to , but I start to make some little noises . Before I know it , my eyes have rolled back in my head , and I 've begun to suck my own damn finger . For Catholic girls , it 's easier to be kinky with a man we do n't know . <p> Do n't think less of me , okay ? I have never been a one-man woman any more than my daddy was a one-woman man . It 's in my genes . I did n't sleep around , exactly . But you know how I did . I had multiple possibilities to get me through my day . My girlfriends can confirm this for you when they get here . Just ask them , any of them . All my adult life , until I got married , I juggled men , at least two at a time , as a form of insurance . If one left me , the way my daddy did , or did n't pay enough attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ass shot dead by hoodlums , like my brother did , there was always the other one to step in . I been like that since high school , when I first started dating Juan and realized my love for him was so big it might crush me if he ever lost interest . I kept them all at a distance after understanding that . None of them have been close to my heart except him , and now he 's breaking it with his santa madre act . I am a sound investor  --  never put in more than you can afford to lose . The safest bets involve a diversified portfolio . I 'm all about biology and financial planning . <p> The pumping gets faster . Marcus goes to work , okay ? Something about athletes . They know their bodies . Ay , m'ija . Why does chingando have to feel so good ? Would n't the world 's problems be solved if sex felt more like plunging up a clogged toilet ? You do n't like to think God screwed up , but with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasurable sex , there 'd be no risk of overpopulation , no AIDS , no unwanted pregnancies , and no cheating wives . <p> " Harder , baby , " I tell Marcus as I press my eyes closed and flex my calf muscles . I could get used to this man . Yes , I could . If I were n't married , I mean . Which I am . I am married . Have to remember . That . Oh . God . " I 'm almost there . " <p> He says nothing , and , like the husband I wish I had married instead of the one I got , does exactly what I ordered . <p> When we finish , he leans up on his elbow , all sweet-looking , kisses me gently on the lips , and says , with a tear in his eye , " It has been a long time since I did that , Usnavys Rivera . " <p> " Pssh . You 're lying . " <p> " No , no , I 'm not lying . " He closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , melancholy smile , mouthing numbers as he counts on his fingers . His eyes open and he regards me seriously . " Three years . It has been three years since I made love to a woman . " <p> " What ? Why ? You scared of girls , Marcus ? " <p> The tears brim a little more , and one of them traces a line down his check . He wipes it away with a strong , solid hand I 'm sure does n't do dishes all day . " No , I 'm not scared of girls . Three years ago . That 's when my wife died . I have n't met anyone who interested me , and , frankly , did not think I ever would . Until now . " <p> I balk . " I 'm the first ? Since your wife died ? " <p> Marcus nods , and smiles with a hint of sadness that is quickly replaced by something that looks like love . " You remind me of her . You two . You look alike . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A firecracker , " I say . I do n't know what else to tell him . I remind the man of his dead wife , and he loved her , and I know he 's transferring that onto me and I do n't deserve it , but still . Transfers can feel real , m'ija . They can . You should n't be jealous of a dead woman , but for some reason , I am . I imagine the house they lived in , the wine they shared on the terrace , the elegance of her husband a sharp contrast to the ordinariness of mine . <p> " So , I hope this wo n't be the last time we see one another , " he says . " I 'd love to get a number for you in Boston . I travel out that way quite a bit . And now that I 've met you , I have a reason to go more often . " <p> I should know better , girl , I should . I realize that . This is the part where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and child . Denial is a wonderful thing , though , when you need it . So it is that I get up and walk to the desk , and I write my cell number down on the little hotel pad of paper . I rip off the sheet , hand it to him , wondering how on earth I 'm going to keep Juan from finding this shit out . I 'm going to have to start policing my phone like a guard . I 'm going to have to sneak and lie my ass off . What is wrong with me , m'ija ? I should n't have opened this door , but what else am I supposed to do ? Old habits die hard . <p> The man , Marcus , this beautiful man who pleased me , is crying , and he plays golf , and I remind him of a woman he loved . And you know what that all means , do n't you ? It means that even with my size and attitude and my current moral relativism , even with my head all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand different directions , he just might be able to love me the way I have deserved to be loved all my life . <p> Excerpted from Dirty Girls on Top by Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez <p> Copyright 2008 by Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez <p> Published in 2008 by St. Martin
