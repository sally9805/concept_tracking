Lost , I cried out , " Spirit Orenda ! Creator of the World ! Do n't let them take me . Father , where are you ? " I thrashed and flailed , endeavoring to fight off my enemies before they did something unspeakable . My father 's strong hands seized my young body and held me very still . He kept my arms against my sides until I stopped struggling . When I gasped awake , confused and breathing as if I had been running , he pulled me close against his powerful chest . " It 's me , Gahrahstah . You 're home . " His familiar smell of sweat , resin , and tobacco told me I was safe even before I could force the visions from my eyes . He pulled back just a little until I could see the hard angles in his face softened by the orange glow from the fire pit . I was home on my bed in Grandmother 's longhouse . No foreign warrior had dragged me away . No enemy braves bellowed war cries as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was Gahrahstah , granddaughter to Wolf Clan Mother , daughter to my mother , Glad Song , and my father , Dehateh , Bear Clan 's first war chief . My older sister leaned over , asking what was wrong . My aunts and cousins came also , to see if I had been hurt . My mother calmly explained that I had had a troubling dream . She reminded them that children 's dreams are often no more than dreams , and not necessarily visions . Children are too easily influenced by what they hear , she explained , and advised them to go back to sleep . I was not so sure ; it had seemed too real . The vivid pictures dragged themselves slowly to the outer edge of my consciousness asreality took over . I breathed in the sounds and smells of home in the deepness of night , grunts and snores , whispered conversations , fathers and mothers doing what they do to bring more children into our clan . I felt ashamed to have shaken with dread at the pictures my dream showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother remained concerned . She smoothed my damp hair back from my forehead and combed it through her fingers . I leaned into her hands , relaxing . " Tell me exactly what you saw while you slept , " she commanded . " Even though you are young , perhaps your dream did contain a message for our shaman to decipher . " " I saw many foreign braves attacking us at Doteoga . They were nearly to the stockade . I screamed out to warn you , but one of them seized me and dragged me away with him when our defenders came out to drive them off . You were there , too , Father . " I looked at him to remind myself that he was solid . " You carried your war club and called to me that you were coming . You led the Wolf Clan warriors to bring me home , instead of running with your own clan . " " Why would I lead Wolf Clan when I always lead the Bears ? Your mother 's clan has its own war leaders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a puzzle to me . It would take a shaman to make sense of it . " I shook my head , trying to make sense of my dream , but my shame heated my cheeks and distracted me from the original problem . I roused myself to remember if there were anything more I could tell my parents . In case it might help , I added , " Our enemies wore strange war-paint designs . " " Naturally , they did , " Mother said . " I will have to give this some thought . " As soon as my mother loosened her hold , I moved back into my corner of the bed bench , ashamed before my sister and cousins that I had awakened them . " You can be sure no enemy will come here , " Mother added softly . " Our lookouts would never let anyone catch us off guard . Remember that . Also remember that Ganeogaono girls do n't cry out or show fear . " " I know . I should have fought off the dream in silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do better if it happens again . " She tucked me back into my furs and wished me peaceful dreams . Too excited yet to sleep , I listened as Mother discussed my dream with Father . " It 's all that war talk the child hears , " she said . " Orenda , bring down that Onondaga shaman . Destroy his power and remove him from Turtle Island , Great Spirit , before he causes more trouble . He wo n't carry his war east to us . We are safe here in Doteoga , far away from Onondaga Country , are n't we , Dehateh ? " My father spoke too softly for me to hear his reply . By then , my sister had returned to her sleeping place beside the wall and curled into her furs again . In his hanging cradleboard against the lodge pole , my baby brother slept again . Seeing me awake , Father crept over and whispered into my ear , " Dream only good dreams , Gahrahstah . All our warriors are home . They will protect Doteoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent a night terror again , but it was easier to be brave when I was awake . Our village , Doteoga , looks like a porcupine from our cornfields , its walls of jagged spears of felled , sharpened birch and elm leaning outward to frighten our enemies . Inside , stand fifteen longhouses , five for each clan . The Ganeogaono people , Possessors of Flint , have three clans : Wolf , Bear , and Turtle . I 've heard other tribes have Otter and Deer and Beaver clans as well , but these three clans are what our elders decided , so three is all we have . Wolf Clan 's five longhouses belong to my family . Our women cultivate our portion of the corn hills while the men hunt and train our boys . Wolf Clan has its own war leaders , but when all the clans come together for councils and ceremonies , the elders make decisions for the whole of Doteoga . The Doteoga 's faith-keepers keep track of time by the moon . They remind the people when to plant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strawberries , the maple , and , most especially , to the Three Sisters , Corn , Beans , and Squash . Braves and maidens of different clans meet on these occasions . Should their mothers agree to a match , the son moves to his wife 's mother 's longhouse . Any child who results from their union belongs to his wife 's clan . A man will love the children of his sister or female cousins , because he remains of the clan he was born into . It is not that often that a father is close to the children he has sired . I felt fortunate that my father cared for us . Although I had never been farther than half a day 's walk from home , I had heard descriptions of the world . When we were closed in by high snows and dangerous winds , the hunters spoke about far places . I listened to the descriptions and thought about what lay beyond our forest . In the east , the realm of our blood enemies , Algonquin make their towns and villages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of it , most of the time . Ganeogaono braves hunt north of the river only after the Algonquin leave their villages and move to their summer camps near the ocean . Before rumors of the war between the western tribes came , I had a dream that changed my name . In my vision , I saw myselfa charred twig between my thumb and fingers . I moved it over a flattened piece of white bark I had stretched between my crossed legs . Lines emerged from my charcoal as easily as water flowing , until I had drawn a mother wolf sitting on her haunches , alert to guard her cubs . I knew right away this was our clan emblem , the Guardian Wolf . That vision had come two years earlier in spring , when rising sap loosened last year 's bark on the birches . Sometimes , bark falls off by itself when the new bark pushes away the old . Men collect the best curls from the forest floor to line their war canoes and repair the walls after winter 's storms . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us we must , while I walked to the newly turned cornfields . A stray gust lifted a curl of bark from an old birch and blew it against my knees . This was a sign from Orenda . It was so clear , I needed no faith-keeper to tell me its meaning . The Great Spirit had challenged me to repeat my dream , if I could . I carried my sheet of bark home carefully . There , I washed it and pressed it with the tan inner side down against the ground and weighted it down with stones . I had to wipe it off again , but when it was done , I had a dry , clean surface on which to work . I chose several broken pieces of charred wood from the remains of an old fire and put them into a small splint basket to carry . With my bark tucked carefully under my arm , I wandered about the periphery of our cornfield . Between the working women turning over the muddy earth for the next planting and the stockade gate , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patch of dry ground in the early sunlight . It was a little out of the way . Hoping no one would come to disturb me , I made myself comfortable in the long grass . I rested my chin on my knuckles and wiggled my bare toes while I thought . Where was the best place to begin ? It had been easier in the dream . After awhile , I touched my charcoal to the top quarter of my bark sheet and made the first curved line . I wanted her mouth open enough to show her tongue and her fangs . I made the first lines as lightly as possible , fixing and correcting as the outline grew . Little by little , as I became satisfied , I deepened the lines . When the outline was good , I worked on shading and strokes for fur and whiskers . I paid particular attention to her fangs and the slant of her eyes , for she had to be alert and ready if anything threatened . After awhile , if anyone had looked , they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what would make it as good as my dream wolf ? What did it need ? I failed to notice when Grandmother walked up behind me . She watched silently as I worked . When I paused , my blackened fingers cupping my chin to appraise what I had done so far , she bent over to look closer . Her shadow fell across the bark and I , startled , looked around to see what had broken my concentration . " It is good , child , " she said . " Please . You are in my light , " I said , annoyed . A half moment later , I realized my error . I knew Wolf Clan Mother always had to be treated with utmost respect , but I had tossed the words lightly over my shoulder . I dropped my charcoal and my fingers flew to my lips in horror , blackening the lower half of my face . I had been rude for no more reason than that I was spellbound by my own creation . I began to get up and beg her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . She pushed me back down firmly . " Since your wolf is not done , you must continue working on it . When it 's done , give it to me . " " I will , " I promised , glad to be let off so easily . It was not the owning of the thing , that absorbed me , but its creation . Grandmother walked away , motioning my mother to silence and beckoning her to come away . The two returned to the gate and went inside . I had not noticed my mother standing there at all . Although I was troubled , my fingers worked over the bark , thickening the strokes I made with my charred twig to show each hair of my wolf 's thick coat . Later that same day , I talked my mother 's young brother into giving me a small leather package of his red paint . He would not show me where he hid it or how he made it . It was war paint . My uncle 's name was Burns His Lips , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ladled into bowls , so he often ate out of the day cook pots . He pretended to be fierce , but he was young , untested in war , and still wearing his hair in two braids , instead of a warrior 's scalp lock . Burns His Lips was my favorite man in all of Doteoga , next to my father . I did not speak of this , since my uncle was my mother 's brother , so we were of the same clan . My uncle bade me stay inside the stockade while he went for the paint , saying he had it hidden in a special place . I did so impatiently , but I thanked him politely , since I expected I would want more on another day . As soon has he walked off , I ran for my bark to apply the paint to my wolf 's eyes with a chewed willow twig . Next , I touched red to the inside of her ears , her tongue , and to the tips of her pointed fangs . When the picture was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edges , she inspected my wolf . After awhile , she said Orenda had sent me both the dream and the skill to make it real . She used her awl to press two holes across the top of my bark and looped basswood cord through them . My neck and cheeks felt warm when she replaced the tattered old emblem that had hung over the larger doorway of our longhouse . Wolf Clan people strolling by turned to watch . Even Bear Clan and Turtle Clan people walking nearby paused while my grandmother fastened my emblem between the posts over the entrance .
