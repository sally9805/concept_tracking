In life , the creature probably resembled a chimpanzee more than anything else . It moved through a lakeside landscape of grasslands and forest searching for food , accompanied by small bands of its fellows , most likely , and keeping a sharp eye out for pythons , crocodiles and saber-toothed cats . This animal probably shared the forest with apes and monkeys and , like them , spent some time up in the trees . It may have walked upright , which apes rarely do for very long at a stretch . But at a casual glance , it would have seemed to our eyes like just another chimp . <P> In death , however , this creature has just sent shock waves through the world of science . After eight grueling years of hunting in the hot , wind-scoured desert of central Africa , an international team of researchers has uncovered one of the most sensational fossil finds in living memory : the well-preserved skull of a chimp-size animal , probably a male , that does n't fit any known species . According to paleontologist Michel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team reported the find in Nature last week , there is no way it could have been an ape of any kind . It was almost certainly a hominid  --  a member of a subdivision of the primate family whose only living representative is modern man . And it has left scientists gasping with astonishment for several reasons . <P> To start with , it is nearly 7 million years old  --  a million years more ancient than the previous record holder . Indeed , this new species is as much older than the famous Lucy as Lucy is older than we are . It almost certainly dates from very near that crucial moment in prehistory when hominids began to tread an evolutionary path that diverged from that of chimps , our closest living relatives . Even more surprising , this ancient hominid was not discovered anywhere near the Great Rift Valley of East Africa , where all the record setters of the past three decades have been found . Instead , it turned up in the sub-Saharan Sahel region of Chad , more than 1,500 miles to the west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose . <P> Beyond that , the animal 's habitat may cast further doubt on the already beleaguered notion that our ancestors first emerged on a treeless savanna . It now looks as though this pivotal event happened in a setting that was at least partly wooded . Most remarkable of all , though , is the skull itself . The creature , known formally as Sahelanthropus tchadensis ( roughly translated " Sahel hominid from Chad " ) and informally as Toumai ( " hope of life , " in the local Goran language ) , has a mix of apelike and hominid features . And to some paleontologists , the hominid features , especially the face , are a lot more modern-looking than anyone would have expected at so early an evolutionary stage . " A hominid of this age , " writes Bernard Wood of George Washington University , in a commentary accompanying the Nature articles , " ... should certainly not have the face of a hominid less than one-third of its geological age .
