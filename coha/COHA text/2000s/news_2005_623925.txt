<p> Californians who suffered through the power emergency at the beginning of the decade probably are n't inclined to use the word " tragedy " now that one of the big electricity suppliers that made fortunes during the crisis faces ruin . <p> But that 's a word that crops up when veterans of the state 's energy wars speak of the near-collapse of independent power generator Calpine Corp. , a company that soared during the energy crisis and filed for bankruptcy late Tuesday . <p> " It 's a very sad story , " said Mike Florio , senior staff attorney at The Utility Reform Network , a San Francisco consumer advocacy organization that fiercely denounced companies that took advantage of California 's flawed energy deregulation plan in 2000 and 2001 to reap record profits . <p> As California agonized through blackouts and skyrocketing electricity bills , San Jose 's Calpine carried out an ambitious program to build power plants . It based its sweeping construction program on efficient technology that squeezed the most power out of natural gas , the cleanest-burning fuel available . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gov . Gray Davis hailed Calpine as the state 's rescuer . Its founder , Peter Cartwright , is still called a visionary by a top state energy official . <p> To finance its aggressive building program , Calpine used a high-risk strategy , borrowing billions of dollars , largely from the bond market . Company officials expected that growing demand for electricity would provide plenty of cash to repay those obligations . <p> Today , Calpine is going broke , crushed by this heavy debt burden plus the high price of natural gas . The company lost $683.9 million in the first three quarters this year on revenue of $7.5 billion . <p> Bankruptcy creates an uncertain future for the company , which has 3,300 employees and more than 90 power plants across North America . <p> In November , with Calpine running short of cash , the company 's board forced out Cartwright , 75 , after more than two decades as its leader . He was replaced by Robert May , an executive with a history of stabilizing troubled companies , including HealthSouth and cable company Charter Communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did some good things , but they got themselves overextended , " Florio said . " Maybe they did n't appreciate how abrupt the ups and downs of the market could be . " <p> Cartwright  --  drawing on the logical skills of an engineer trained at Ivy League schools and seasoned by years with the U.S. Navy Civil Engineer Corps and General Electric Co.  --  built his power plant empire according to a straightforward business credo : Find a need and fill it . <p> But he could have profited from the creed of the comedian : Timing is everything . <p> Risky market <p> The energy industry is a complex arena riddled with trading gambits and cross-stratagems , wild price fluctuations and sudden reversals . It 's the domain of expert risk managers , hedge funds and speculators . <p> Calpine 's greatest distinction  --  its devotion to clean-burning natural gas  --  is now its Achilles ' heel . Gas prices have risen so high that it 's hard to break-even selling power from gas-fired plants . And Calpine needs a strong cash flow to pay $17 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marathon , during which it amassed 90 plants . <p> " Calpine is caught in kind of a squeeze , " said Michael Peevey , president of the California Public Utilities Commission . <p> Earlier this year , worried creditors started pressuring Calpine as it struggled to keep operating with a paper-thin cash cushion . After Calpine lost a key round in a court fight with its creditors over use of proceeds from asset sales , its share price plunged below $1 and the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading Dec. 6 . <p> The company 's fall shocked investors , who believed so deeply in Calpine that many hung on even as share prices dropped into the basement . <p> " It became like a religion , " said CreditSights Inc. senior utility analyst Dot Matthews . <p> Indeed , Calpine seemed to be making all the right moves after it was founded in 1984 , with backing from private shareholders Guy F. Atkinson Co. , a South San Francisco construction firm , and Electrowatt , a Swiss utility company . <p> In 1989 , Cartwright 's startup began acquiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake . At the time , California was offering hefty incentives for developers of renewable energy sources that supplied electricity from geothermal , wind , biomass and gas co-generation plants to state utilities . <p> But such independent power producers still operated on the fringes of a system dominated by investor-owned utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric Co. , which generated most of their customers ' power and distributed it under a state regulatory structure that assured the utilities a comfortable rate of return on their investments . <p> Deregulation debacle <p> Critics of that system , however , called it bloated , inefficient and expensive for consumers . In 1996 , California passed an energy deregulation bill that opened the power-supply market to competition . The utilities were directed to sell some of their power plants to independent energy producers . The timing was perfect for Calpine , which went public that year at $16 per share . The company was perfectly positioned to use its growing portfolio of generation assets to vie for a cut of the electricity market . <p> Calpine also began an aggressive construction program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All the outside power suppliers made a killing during the initial stages of deregulation , as market prices for wholesale electricity streaked upward . <p> That spike has been variously blamed on blunders by state officials , an electricity shortage due to low hydropower supplies and market manipulation by electricity and natural gas traders such as Enron . <p> Whatever the cause , the utilities lost their shirts because they had to buy power at market prices but could not pass along the full cost to customers protected by state-controlled rates . <p> After the state took over power purchasing from the insolvent utilities , Davis tried to stabilize the electricity market by offering long-term contracts to generators . Calpine was the first supplier to sign up . It also brought new plants into operation to ease the crunch . <p> " When everyone else , all these out-of-state companies , were sticking it to California , Calpine stood up , " said Peevey . " We owe a real debt of gratitude to them . " <p> As evidence grew that market manipulation was behind the price spikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought lower rates on its long-term contracts . Calpine quickly renegotiated its state contracts and agreed to pay a $6 million fine . <p> " Calpine was generally not considered one of the pirate-merchant energy companies , " said Severin Borenstein , director of the University of California Energy Institute . <p> But the deregulation debacle , and the subsequent financial collapse of Enron and other energy firms , helped set the stage for Calpine 's slide . <p> California 's power crisis eased , but the state 's energy regulations remained in limbo . Power demand slowed nationwide as the economy fell into recession . Banks became wary of lending for power projects . <p> Calpine postponed construction on 34 power plants , but steamed ahead on 27 already started . <p> " They continued to build and complete plants after it was clear the market was down , " said Borenstein . Ratings services feared a cash crunch and began downgrading Calpine 's debt . <p> As recently as this year , Calpine brought two major California plants into operation without firm commitments from utilities to buy the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as a symptom of an incoherent state regulatory system . He said the state should set up an even playing field for independent power suppliers to compete with the utilities , which that can take advantage of inside information to bid for contracts and build their own new plants . <p> Pressure from creditors <p> " We 've really had nothing but regulatory instability since the energy crisis , " Robertson said . Calpine has long understood that it needed to secure gas supplies to feed its plants . It started buying gas fields early in its history . But its crushing debt load forced it to sell some of those assets , exposing it to the punishing prices now prevailing on the open market . <p> Peevey said Calpine should be able to emerge from bankruptcy as a smaller company by selling some of its plants or assets to reduce its debt . Some of the company 's creditors will have to settle for much less than full payback , he said . <p> But some experts say the company will be carved up to satisfy its debt holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution to California 's and the nation 's energy infrastructure . But other companies could wind up reaping the profits from what Calpine built . <p> " If that is how the final chapter is written , think about what message that sends , " Robertson said . Calpine responded to the state 's needs and kept the lights on , he said . " Who 's going to follow in those footsteps ?
