Section : Priority SPOTLIGHT Is the Atkins Brand Toast ? <p> WHEN DR . ROBERT ATKINS DIED in April at the age of 72 after slipping on an icy sidewalk outside of his Manhattan medical practice , carb-avoiding dieters across the country were left without their chief patron  --  as were the employees of Atkins Nutritionals , the business that Dr. Atkins launched nearly 15 years ago to sell a line of vitamins . Ironically , however , the company , which markets Atkins-brand packaged foods , has been on a tear in the months following the diet doc 's sudden death . Under its new leadership , Atkins Nutritionals has introduced 70 new products this year  --  a pace un heard of in the food industry . Research firm NPD Group pegs Atkins 's 2002 sales at well over $100 million and 2003 sales to be more than twice that . <p> AGAINST THE GRAIN : Is there a healthy market for Atkins-brand bread ? <p> While observers may be surprised by the furious clip with which Atkins has released new product lines , Atkins himself anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hired the executives who now run the business back in August 2000 . But given that the push into new businesses has accelerated since Atkins 's death , it is possible that the new team has more ambition for the name than the man who put them in place . Atkins Nutritionals president and COO Scott Kabak says the business 's strategy is to place an ever-increasing number of products bearing the company logo  --  a red-and-blue " A "  --  in health food stores and then supermarkets nationwide . " We 're being very aggressive in launching products and expect to continue to be for the foreseeable future " he says . <p> The growth comes despite considerable turmoil in the organization . In October , with the consent of Atkins 's widow , Veronica , the company shut down the doctor 's beloved medical practice . In so doing , Atkins Nutritionals pulled the rug out from under an heir apparent who may have had the vision for the business that most clearly matched that of Atkins himself . Of course , any company , after the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take charge . And this is complicated when the founder is closely identified with the brand . Wendy 's paid homage to founder Dave Thomas in its ads after he died , while Frank Perdue 's son replaced his father as the face of his company . Kentucky Fried Chicken simply turned Colonel Sanders into a cartoon . Now Atkins 's successors must decide how far they will push his name , and how devoted they are to his vision . " The Atkins brand is powerful , " says Scott M. Davis , of brand-strategy consulting firm Prophet , " and has elasticity that most other brands do n't have . " <p> Kabak puts it more succinctly : " This is not a diet but a lifestyle " he says . " There 's no ceiling to this business . " <p> Dr. Atkins first espoused his diet principles more than 30 years ago in his best-selling book , Dr. Atkins ' Diet Revolution . In the years since , his diet has become a cultural phenomenon , with clinicians debating its efficacy while restaurant menus routinely flag Atkins-friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweight or obese , and industry watchers estimate that the number of Americans on a low-carb diet is now as high as 30 million . <p> The executives who Atkins tapped to build out the products business came from publishing : Kabak and Paul D. Wolff , Atkins CEO , had worked together at Times-Mirror Magazines . When the pair , who are both 49 , joined Atkins , the company essentially had two products  --  a line of protein-rich shakes , similar to Slim-Fast , and a line of protein bars , called Atkins Advantage . These two lines sold moderately well , but the business that the partners took over pales in comparison to what they have now : Atkins has introduced more than 100 products in the last three years . <p> But despite the company 's rapid growth , the medical practice  --  called the Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine  --  was always Dr. Atkins 's primary focus . Located in midtown Manhattan , it had 4,000 active patients in 2003 . Devotees came from as far away as Uzbekistan , even though they were required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE WIDOW : Former opera singer Veronica Atkins , with a portrait of her late husband , decided to shut down his practice . <p> When Atkins died , a brash , 34-year-old doctor named Keith Berkowitz emerged as his successor at the clinic . Here 's where the absence of the founder was most obviously felt . The products company had coexisted peacefully with the practice when Atkins was alive . But though the doctor had founded both businesses , the principals decided that the two entities should split up following his death . The plan was for Berkowitz to buy the practice for an undisclosed sum ; as part of the deal , he would give up the Atkins name , which was important to the product marketers . <p> Then on October 2  --  just days before Berkowitz was set to ink the deal  --  Atkins Nutritionals announced in a press release that the center would cease operations 13 days later . Patients were informed that they would need to seek treatment elsewhere . The center 's 25 employees were given notice . Berkowitz was stunned . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad for me to see the medical practice close , but I am gratified to see my husband 's teachings being accepted and practiced by physicians in this country and around the world . " ( Through a company publicist , Veronica Atkins declined to speak to Inc . ) <p> Richard Rothstein , the spokesperson for Atkins Nutritionals , says he thinks the deal broke down over money  --  an assertion with which Berkowitz disagrees . When asked if he believes Dr. Atkins would be disappointed that the practice closed , Berkowitz says " probably "  --  madding that his mentor would approve of his subsequent plans to open his own practice in New York , employing most of his former colleagues . <p> Kabak says that the clinic closed precisely because Dr. Atkins played a central role in it . In contrast , the products business can survive without him " because he was never very involved , " Kabak says . " He wanted to produce products , but it 's not what made him tick . " And so the company continues to roll out everything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketed under the Atkins label . The company has also struck licensing deals with the likes of New England dairy producer HP Hood , which is selling a line of milk called Carb Countdown with 75% to 90% fewer carbohydrates than regular milk . Mary Ellen Spencer , vice president of brand marketing for Hood , says she got on the Atkins bandwagon because " it 's no secret that this thing is growing . " <p> In fact , Atkins is likely to attract big-name competitors , as well as partners . Already , H.J. Heinz and Michelob are introducing low-carb products  --  and a growing number of niche players are making goods like sugar-free chocolate bars . On the plus side , retail demand is also rising . Wal-Mart Supercenters stock the Atkins-Hood milk , and a spokesperson for the health food chain GNC , which operates 4,500 stores in the U.S. , says its larger stores now stock four shelves with low-carb products  --  up from one shelf last year . <p> Of course , as brand consultant Davis notes , " it is possible to follow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers have options , Davis adds , the company will succeed only if Atkins products taste good . That may be tricky because , to strip carbs out of food , the company replaces key ingredients like wheat with soy and almond flour  --  a process that can muddy the taste . Indeed , in online chatrooms where Atkins followers swap recipes , taste comments pop up a lot . One person used the word blech to describe Atkins barbecue sauce ; another complained that the pancake syrup was " no Mrs. Butterworth 's . " <p> High prices may also limit the brand 's appeal  --  several chatroom posters said that the $4.99 price tag for four small single-serving ice-cream cups was a bit steep . " I suppose that if some people get desperate enough for a bagel or cereal , they may be willing to pay anything , " says Hayes Roth , a vice president of the brand consulting firm Landor . " But there is a point where the price gets too high . " <p> Despite these problems , however , the team extending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diet doc did n't really manage the products business , his loss is not acutely felt there . Sure , the patients he treated will miss him . But consumers will probably forget that Atkins was , in fact , a real person in time . For a brand , that 's okay . " To be honest , " says Roth , " I did n't even know that he was still alive when I read that he had died . " Michelle Leder <p> UPDATE THE SWEET SMELL OF A SETTLEMENT <p> In the end , there was only a terse statement , quietly released on October 22 . Jennifer Lopez , perfume giant Coty Inc. , and Lopez 's company , Sweetface Fashion , had decided to settle the lawsuit brought against them by Terri Williamson of Glow Industries for infringement of her trademark . Williamson , who had been prepared to go to trial , agreed to phase out her use of the Glow mark on her body care and fragrance products ; Lopez would continue to own and use the Glow by J.Lo mark for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the settlement agreement were not disclosed , " the press release concluded . <p> It does n't take a genius , however , to figure out that a large sum of money changed hands . Williamson had already concluded last January that she would have to re-brand her business in the face of the saturation marketing campaign accompanying the launch of Glow by J.Lo . ( See " Whose Brand Is It , Anyway ? " May 2003 . ) She also knew that starting over would be expensive . " I had to change my strategy , " she says . " Before , I 'd been trying to protect the name and keep them from using it . When I realized I 'd have to change it even if I won the case , I began to focus on receiving a fair and reasonable value for the brand I 'd created . " And did she get it ? " I 'm very happy with the way things worked out , " she says , choosing her words carefully . " I think both parties are . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no comment . <p> In the days after the settlement , Williamson says , " I started getting really excited about re-visioning the whole business , which is  --  I have to say  --  a lot of fun . " And the new name ? " I have some possibilities , " she says . " I 'm planning to ask my customers for suggestions . If anybody has ideas , I 'd love to hear them .
