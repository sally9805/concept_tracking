I always loved Richie 's hands . They looked like such man 's hands . I knew that I was guilty of gross gender stereotyping , but I kept my mouth shut about it , and no one knew . His hands rested on the table between us , the right one on top of the left . They were still . Richie was always still . It was one of the things that had made it hard to be married to him . I knew intellectually that he loved me , but he was so contained and interior that I used to crave even the most unseemly display of feeling . He was still now , sitting across the table from me , telling me he 'd met someone else . We were divorced . It was fine for him to see other people . I saw other people too . But this was a somebody else he 'd met . This was more than seeing other people . This made me feel like my center had collapsed . " Somebody , like walk into the sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , " Richie said . " She has a right to that . " " And you ? " Richie shrugged . " I 'm thinking about it . " " Three kids and a house in the western suburbs ? " " We have n't talked about that , " Richie said . " What about Rosie ? " I said . " She likes dogs . " I looked at the hamburger I had ordered . I did n't want it . " Rosie would still want to visit , " I said . " I love Rosie , " Richie said . " Has Ms. Right met her ? " I said . " Yes . " " They get along ? " " Very well , " Richie said . " Rosie loves her . " She does not . " Rosie will remain my dog , " I said . Richie smiled at me . " We 're not going to have a custody fight over a goddamn bull terrier , are we ? " " Not as long as we remember she 's mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But not hers . " " No . Mine and yours , " Richie said . " She lives with you and visits me . " I nodded . Richie was quiet . " How long have you been seeing Ms. Right ? " I said . " About three months . " " Three months . " Richie nodded . " You 're sleeping with her , " I said . " Of course . " " Do you love Ms. Right ? " I said . " Her name is Carrie . " " Do you love Carrie ? " " I do n't know . " " And how are you going to find out ? " I said . " I do n't know . " Richie had ordered a club sandwich , on whole wheat , toasted . He had n't eaten any of it . The waitress stopped at our table . " Is everything all right ? " she said . " Fine , " Richie said . " Can I get you anything else ? " " No , " Richie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you want me to have your food wrapped ? " the waitress said . " No thank you , " Richie said . The waitress looked at me . I shook my head . She put a check on the table and went away looking regretful . Richie and I looked at each other . " Whaddya think ? " he said . I shook my head . " I know , " Richie said . He looked at the check and took some bills out of his wallet and put them on the table . " The thing is , " he said , " I ca n't get past you . " " Oh ? " " I mean , we 're sort of spinning our wheels . " " You could call it that , " I said . " I mean this is a nice woman , and she 's happy with who and what I am . " I nodded . " But I ca n't get past you , " Richie said . " I face somewhat the same problem , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I thought the divorce was supposed to be some kind of resolution , " I said . Richie smiled quietly . " I did too , " he said . " But it was n't , " I said . " No . It was n't . " " So what are we supposed to do ? " I said . " I 'm serious about this woman . " I nodded . It was difficult for me to speak . The room around me seemed insubstantial , as if I were drifting in space . " But , " he said , " I ca n't imagine a life without you in it . " " So , " I said . " What the hell is this , a warning that you 're going to try ? " " I guess it is , " Richie said . The room was nearly empty . There was only one other table occupied , by three people calmly having lunch . The waitress stayed away from us . Discreet . I looked at the money that Richie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss Rosie , " Richie said . " She misses you . " I was quiet . Richie was perfectly still , his hands folded motionless on the table . We were so silent that I was aware of his breathing across the table . " Are we really talking about the dog here ? " Richie said . " No , " I said , " we goddamned sure are not . "
