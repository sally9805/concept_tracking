Tiger By Jeff Stone Random House Jeff Stone This is stupid , Fu mumbled from the bottom of the terra-cotta barrel . How long do we have to stay inside this thing ? I feel like a pickled vegetable . Shhh ! warned his brother Malao , lying directly on top of him . Grandmaster told us to remain perfectly quiet , and perfectly still . I know what Grandmaster said , Fu replied . But we ca n't stay crammed in here forever . I say we get out right now . I say we stop hiding and fight ! Calm yourself , Fu , whispered his brother Seh from on top of Malao . We are all just as cramped and uncomfortable as you are . But we must do as Grandmaster said and remain silent and hidden . The enemy within our walls is unlike any faced by Cangzhen Temple in more than a thousand years . Yeah , yeah , Fu said . Stop being so dramatic . You guys are sounding more and more like Grandmaster every day . I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've all passed the tests . We should n't be hiding like a bunch of girls . We should be Hush ! snapped Fu 's brother Hok , who was lying on top of Seh . That 's enough , Fu ! You 're making even me angry now . I do n't care ! Fu replied . If you think Quiet ! hissed Fu 's oldest brother , Long , from the top of the pile . Control your tongues , all of you ! Brother Fu , empty the words from your mouth and then empty your mind . You must take control of your thoughts and your emotions , or they will control you . You must take control of your thoughts and your emotions , or they will control you , Fu mocked . Give me a break , Long . Right now we need action , not philosophy . Fu was quickly losing his patience . He could hear enemy horses racing up and down the brick pathways that crisscrossed the temple grounds . He also heard weapons clashing and men crying outplus a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except every boom was followed by a pain-filled scream . Fu 's keen ears recognized each and every scream . Warrior monks were falling . A low growl resonated deep within Fu 's chest . He did n't understand why his four brothers , stacked above him in the barrel , were holding back . Like him , each had mastered a style of animal kung fu that reflected both his personality and his body type . In fact , their true natures were so perfectly matched with their kung fu styles that they were each named after the animal they mirrored . They were born to fight . But they would n't . Fu , the tiger , growled again . His brothers did n't look like him , walk like him , talk like him , or even smell like him . And they certainly did n't think like him . He called them brothers because they all were Buddhist and lived in the temple together . In reality , he and his brothers were orphans . What Fu needed were real brothers . Brothers who would fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . I ca n't believe we are just going to Please ! Long interrupted . No more talking ! We all have to remain silent . Brother Fu , focus your breathing . Meditate like the rest of us have been doing . If you find that you can not meditate , just lie still and relax . That 's easy for you to say , Fu replied . You 're on top . Try lying down here at the bottom of the pile in a pool of water with Malao 's nasty feet pressing up against your lips . Malao giggled softly and wiggled his toes . If you do that again , Malao , I 'll bite them off one at a time , Fu said . I swear I will . Malao giggled again but kept his toes still . How much longer am I going to be stuck in here ? Fu wondered . He hoped for his brothers ' sake they would all get out of the barrel soon , because he was n't sure if he could control himself much longer .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
