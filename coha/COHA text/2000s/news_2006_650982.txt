<p> READERS who have peppered the public editor for months with complaints about The New York Times 's " phony " and " tortured " explanations for granting anonymity to sources should be happy . The paper has shifted toward a more flexible  --  and more realistic  --  approach to how it explains to readers why it is using an anonymous source . <p> An ambitious push spelled out in a June 2005 staff memo from Bill Keller , the executive editor , required reporters to explain why they had granted anonymity to each unnamed source . The guidelines also called for descriptions of how unnamed sources knew what they knew and what motivated them to talk  --  helpful information that the paper continues to want in stories . <p> Complaints about The Times 's labored phrases for why it was granting anonymity became part of my Nov. 20 column , which also cited some benefits of the paper 's effort . Readers continued to protest that the explanations had little value . Barry Jagoda , of La Jolla , Calif. , pronounced them " phony alibis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Several key pieces of information in a May 4 article about a film studio management disagreement came from executives who " spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not want to be associated with the conflict " at the studio . " BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONFLICT , " Jeff Huggins , of Scotts Valley , Calif. , shouted to me in an e-mail . " Is that a suitable reason for granting anonymity and using a quote or piece of information in an article ? " <p> Explanations for anonymity that too readily buy the source 's rationalization can strain logic almost to absurdity . It happened in a July 13 article about leaks of classified documents in Britain that had led to charges under the Official Secrets Act . A source , who had generally characterized to The Times 's reporter one secret document  --  thereby possibly violating the act  --  sought and was given anonymity " because he said he was bound by the secrets act . " <p> The paper 's habit of saying that it had " granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the readers it was trying to inform more fully . " The Times 's explanation of providing sources anonymity sounds a bit imperious , " Pat Murphy , of Ketchum , Idaho , wrote in an April 25 e-mail . " ' Granted ' sounds like dispensation from the Pope . " <p> The Times 's shift away from requiring explicit explanations of the use of anonymity began to emerge in a May 31 memo to the staff . Craig Whitney , an assistant managing editor who had recently succeeded Allan M. Siegal as the standards editor , made no mention of Mr. Keller 's June 2005 pronouncement that editors " must press " for disclosure of why the paper feels each source is entitled to anonymity . Noting that " on rare occasion , some readers have found some of our explanations pompous or silly , " Mr. Whitney wrote approvingly of phrases that did n't include any explicit reasons for why the paper had agreed to allow a source to remain anonymous . <p> Although some of this flexibility began showing up in the paper , I confess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , when I queried Mr. Keller and Mr. Whitney for this column , did the new flexibility become clear to me . Mr. Whitney said the June 2005 memo remains in effect , but he offered this new interpretation in an e-mail to me : <p> " My interpretation of that policy is that as long as we somehow explain what the authoritativeness of the source is , why the source could n't or did n't speak for attribution , and either explicitly or implicitly , why we decided to use the information , we 're giving readers at least some ways of evaluating the information for themselves . " <p> This is good , for readers and the staff . Although I 'm a by-the-book sort of newspaperman , it had become obvious to me that this kind of flexibility is needed for the complicated and varied bargaining that goes on between reporters and sources over information  --  and anonymity . <p> What does this mean for you as a Times reader ? Mr. Whitney said in his May memo that the phrase " ' speaking on condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quote a source by name . " So there will be more " speaking on the condition of anonymity " attributions without any explicit reference to the paper granting it or any reasons for doing so . This makes a great deal of sense  --  and it 's easy to add the reasons when they are warranted . <p> Readers will also see more allusions to the clout that many sources  --  unnamed and named  --  can have because they control information sought by reporters . Since powerful newspapers such as The Times do n't always publicly acknowledge when they find themselves supplicants for information , it will be beneficial for readers to be reminded of the grip sources frequently have on what reporters need . Mr. Whitney is encouraging variations on the " speaking on condition of anonymity " attribution , including " agreed to speak only if he were not identified , " or " would discuss X only if not quoted by name . " <p> Some realities of anonymous sourcing negotiations deserve to be noted , even if some people think they 're obvious . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one overriding reason that is seldom explicitly acknowledged : the reporter wanted or needed information that a reluctant source possessed . That 's probably one reason some of The Times 's past explanations for anonymity have been so absurd . <p> ( Sources differ , of course . In this discussion , I 'm thinking more about " reluctant " sources than about " agenda " sources . Reluctant sources often have to be wooed , and provide information for something other than promoting a cause , while the agenda ones are often " spinning " to make their agency , enterprise or ideas look good . ) <p> From the perspective of a source , especially one operating in the agenda mode , there may well be interest in promoting some idea or cause . But for all sources , the top priority is almost always to avoid being held responsible for the disclosure  --  a need that can be met by demanding anonymity . <p> All this is why I found myself a few months ago  --  when explicit descriptions were still always required for why anonymity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental realities at work . Here 's what my reality-based attribution boiled down to : " according to a senior agency official , who was granted anonymity by The Times in the belief that the value of the information warranted allowing the source to avoid any responsibility for its unauthorized disclosure . " <p> This riff on the realities of anonymity brings into focus the crucial issue of the value of the information the reporter is getting . That value needs to be weighed against the cost to The Times 's credibility of adding yet another anonymous source to the next day 's paper . <p> One benefit of requiring the often-clunky explanation for providing anonymity was that it may have spurred reporters and editors to think more carefully about the value of the information . That could be one reason , I 've surmised , that I seem to have spotted fewer casual uses of anonymous sources that add only marginal color or comment in articles . Mr. Whitney suggests that reporters , no longer always obligated to draft explicit explanations of anonymity , will have more time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiate . <p> With the paper no longer insisting on tortured explanations of why anonymity was granted , reporters and editors should be pressed to devote more time to the two other disclosures that Mr. Keller wants about each anonymous source . One is giving readers the best possible sense of how well positioned the source is to know whereof he speaks . The other is alerting the reader to what is motivating the source to talk to The Times . Modest fulfillment of either of these disclosure objectives can be much more helpful to readers than were the explicit explanations of anonymity . <p> Giving readers an idea of a source 's knowledge of what he 's talking about is tough . A reporter courting a source with assurances of confidentiality must always keep in mind the need to retain the freedom to mention general descriptors such as his agency , generic rank or profession . Disclosure of a source 's possible motives for talking is less often part of any deal on confidentiality , so the robustness of the revelations depends more on the amount of reporting done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's natural temptation to minimize any motives that raise bias questions about a keystone source . And that 's why even good reporters need good editors who ask tough questions and demand the appropriate disclosure . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
