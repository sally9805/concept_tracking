EDUCATION With the rapid spread of AIDS , sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) and unintended pregnancies , would you want your child to be taught to abstain from sex or be taught to have safe sex ? The nation is debating the question , and the current administration hopes to resolve the situation by finding programs that teach teenagers to wait until marriage to have sex . But is teaching abstinence the best form of sex education ? U.S. Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher recently received some criticism for his frank report , The Surgeon General 's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior , which urges America to engage in honest discussion about sensitive sexual issues . Dr. Satcher told JET , " The whole point is that you teach abstinence as well as sex education to make sure that young people know how to protect themselves and others . So you teach both , not one or the other . " What we said in our report was that there are no good studies demonstrating that abstinence-only programs work , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people should be encouraged to remain abstinent until they 're involved in an enduring , committed , mutually monogamous relationship . " The surgeon general explains that studies show sexual activity in teenagers does not increase once they are told how to protect themselves .

Photograph " We ca n't just say no ' as Nancy Reagan said some years ago . That does n't work , " states clinical psychologist Dr. Michelle D. Owens . // " The research shows just the opposite , " says Dr. Satcher . " Teenagers who really understand are able to make decisions , and many of them decide to delay sexual activity until they 're in the right kind of relationship or marriage . " Dr. Michelle D. Owens , a clinical psychologist researching teen pregnancy and spirituality in Atlanta , agrees with Dr. Satcher in that abstinence only serves as a partial discussion about sexual education . " The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one without the other , " says Dr. Owens . " We ca n't just say no ' as ( first lady ) Nancy Reagan said some years ago ( about drugs ) . That does n't work . Instead , we need to ask teens simple questions : Do you know how your body works ? " Do you know that you can get pregnant by doing this or by doing that ? ' " Dr. Owens stresses that teens need to know that abstinence is not something that should be looked at in a negative way . " I think that teens need to realize that they 're not missing out on something by not being sexually active , " she says . " They need to hear that it 's actually cool to wait . They need to hear this from their peers as well as from their parents . " NBA player A.C. Green of the Miami Heat , who practices sexual abstinence , wholeheartedly believes that abstinence is the best form of sex education . " You need to start at the highest level and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , " states Green . " Shoot for the stars , aim for the sky , but let them know it 's possible and put it out there as an option as opposed to just a little whisper . " I think abstinence is so important because it helps kids in particular stay focused , " Green says . " It helps them learn what commitment is , learn what it means to have self-control as well as learn to respect yourself and your fellow peers . " Green , a well-known advocate of abstinence , is the founder and president of the A.C. Green Youth Foundation . For the past 16 years he has sponsored a weeklong summer basketball day camp for underprivileged children in Miami , Phoenix , Oregon and Los Angeles that stresses the importance of the issue . " I have a curriculum for middleschool students called Game Plan ' and it 's solely based on abstinence . A second curriculum called I 've Got The Power ' is dedicated to abstinence and character issues for middle-school , junior and high school kids , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami Heat wholeheartedly believes that abstinence is the best form of sex education . Photograph Dr. Joycelyn Elders , former U.S. surgeon general , feels that children need to be empowered with information in order to make good decisions . // He adds , " It 's a reality that kids are dying from causes of sexual activity . You 're not going to find a tombstone stating that Frankie died because he was a virgin . " I speak from practical experience . I practice abstinence , " he admits . " I can tell them what it 's done for me and my career , my determination and being able to reach certain goals that rve put out there for myself . And more importantly the self-esteem that I have . " Green maintains that even with everyday temptations from society , abstinence is still very possible for today 's youth . " You can practice abstinence , " Green stresses . " I 'm sick of the assumption being made that kids are going to have sex . " Dr. Joycelyn Elders , former U.S. surgeon general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sex education . She contends that it is only a part of a comprehensive curriculum . " It 's a form of child abuse as far as I 'm concerned , " states Dr. Elders . " I feel that you are abusing children if you are not empowering them with the knowledge to protect themselves from being able to have the information to make good decisions . " Dr. Elders says that children need to be taught about their sexuality early in life , giving them all the information needed to be levelheaded . " I feel very strongly that it 's not good enough to just teach reading , writing and arithmetic . We 've got to teach young people how to be responsible , " she explains . " In this era of HIV disease , STDs and teenage pregnancies , abstinence only is just not enough . " According to Dr. Elders , 30 percent of today 's teens who are educated about the subject are saying no to sex . " The teens who have been educated are more likely to say no and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have n't been given any information , " she explains . Dr. Elders supports Dr. Satcher on the " call to action " and notes that sex education is a lifelong lesson . <p>
