In the moments before , she laid a hand on his arm . " No matter what , " she said , giving him a look , " you can not stop . " He turned away . " I 'm not sure I can even start . " She brought his hand to her lips , kissed each finger . " If you do n't do it , " she said simply , " who will ? " For a long while they sat side by side , staring out a streaked window at a town neither of them knew very well . He watched her breathing pattern in the reflection of the glass , and tried to slow his own heart until they were equally matched . The quiet dulled his senses , so that he became fixated on the clock beside the bed . He would not blink , he told himself , until the next minute bled into the last . With a fury that surprised him , he turned his face into the bow of her neck , trying to commit to memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She smiled , that crooked little curving of her mouth . " Now , " she said , " do n't you think I know that ? " In the end , she had struggled . He wore the scratches like a brand . But he had held the pillow to her face ; calmed her by whispering in her ear . My love , he had said , I 'll be with you as soon as I can . At the words her arms had fallen away ; then it was over . He had buried his face in her shirt , and started himself the very slow process of dying . For the hundredth time that day , Cameron MacDonald , Chief of Police in Wheelock , Massachusetts , closed his eyes and dreamed of the Bay of Biscay . If he got it just right the thrum of silence in the station , the afternoon light dancing over the corner of his scarred desk he could make himself believe . There was no Smith and Wesson jabbing into his side ; there was no mountain pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Cameron MacDonald anymore . He opened his mind as wide as he could , and let himself tumble into the beautiful blue of it . He blinked his eyes , expecting the bobbing shoreline of Prest , or the sweet scent of the Loire Valley that you could carry in your pocket when you were within a reasonable distance , but he found himself staring at the pale , pasty face of Hannah , the secretary at the police station . " Here 's the file , " she said . " He was indicted . " She turned to leave , but stopped for a moment with her hand on the door . " You sure you 're not coming down with something , Chief ? " Cam shook his head , as much to clear it as to convince Hannah . He smiled at her , because if he did n't , he knew she 'd be on the phone with Allie and within a half hour , his wife would have him drinking a tea made of nettle roots and feverfew . He put the file down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public safety equipment , inside which he 'd stuffed a Travel magazine . Hannah was right there was something wrong with him . It was the same thing that happened every year since he 'd returned to Wheelock , as was expected , to become police chief after his father 's death . He was suffering from wanderlust , complicated by the tension of knowing that he was rooted to this town by something as simple as his name . Wheelock looked like other small western Massachusetts towns : the center consisted of a simple white church and a lending library , a joint building for fire and police , the local coffee shop , and a dotting of old men who sat on stone benches and watched their lives slouch by . But what made Wheelock different from Hancock and Dalton and Williamstown was the fact that had it not been for a twist of fate , nearly every family in Wheelock would still be living in Scotland . At first you would n't notice . But then you 'd see that the town restaurant served its specials on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white china was decorated with the fat square rose of Bonnie Prince Charlie . You 'd attend a marriage at St. Margaret 's , and realize that the ceremony still ended with a blood vow . You 'd drive through the winding side streets and see the name MACDONALD painted on an alarming number of mailboxes . And if you happened to travel to the Scottish Highlands , you 'd notice that a small town called Carrymuir on the banks of Loch Leven was an uncanny twin to Wheelock , Massachusetts . In the 1700s , the Clan MacDonald was the largest and most powerful clan in Scotland , spread from the western isles through the main Highlands . One particular sect of the clan lived in Carrymuir , a small town north of Glencoe which was nestled between two jagged crags of mountains . In spite of the rampant clan warfare in Scotland , Carrymuir had never been defeated , built as it was in a natural , easily defended fortress . Clann was the Scottish Gaelic word for children , and a clan was made up of relatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a given piece of land . The clan chief , or laird , had the power of life and death over his tenants and tacksmen , but the authority was n't quite as one-sided as a king 's . After all , the chief 's subjects were his brothers and nephews and cousins , and the trust and respect they offered up to him came at the price of his protection and his promise to care for them . Cameron MacDonald of Wheelock , Massachusetts , had been named for his **41;434;TOOLONG , a legendary soldier who had fought in the battle of Culloden , where the English routed the Highlanders . Cameron had heard the story over and over as a boy : When his namesake realized that Bonnie Prince Charlie 's Highland army did n't stand a chance against the English soldiers , he tried to save his clansmen from being killed in battle . He secured their honorable discharges by promising , in exchange , his own remarkable skill in a fight to the death against the British . But he had n't died , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English came through Scotland burning towns and slaughtering livestock and raping village women , the first Cameron MacDonald realized he had to again save his clan . So while he went to jail as a Jacobite prisoner , he arranged for the families of Carrymuir to leave , one by one , on packets bound for the American colonies . Which explained why , when most Scots were being hanged or sold as indentured servants to the West Indies , this small sect of Clan MacDonald remained intact and resettled in the wilderness of Massachusetts . They found a spot that looked like home , with a brace of rolling mountains and a narrow body of water that was more of a pond than a lake , and sent word back to Scotland about this place . Wee loch , they wrote . It 's set by a wee loch . And eventually , the laird and his family came over too , leaving a trusted uncle to watch over the land in Scotland . They traded the comfortable kilt for trousers ; they proudly flew the Stars and Stripes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a natural extension of inbred responsibility , the man who was the figurehead of the Clan MacDonald also became Wheelock 's police chief . In 1995 , that position belonged to Cameron MacDonald II , having been handed down from his great-grandfather to his grandfather to his father , passing along the same line of succession as the honorary title of clan chief . He 'd be the first to tell you that things had changed . Obviously , although he was considered the chief of a clan and duly noted in the Scottish records , he was no longer directly responsible for the welfare of the townspeople . At least three-quarters of the town had never even seen the lands in Scotland that technically belonged to them . Hardly anyone spoke with a burr ; fewer still knew more than a smattering of Gaelic . On the other hand , old habits died hard . There was no tarnished silver bowl or royal edict that proved that Wheelock was MacDonald land , but it was theirs just the same , in the way that their ancestors had laid claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was land , quite simply , they 'd lived on forever . At age thirty-five , Cameron MacDonald knew he would stay in Wheelock for the rest of his life ; that he would be the police chief until he died and passed the office to his firstborn son . He knew these were things he did not have a choice about , no more than he had a choice about tossing off the choking obligation of being the current laird . Sometimes , in the very still parts of the night , he would tell himself that an honorary title did not mean today what it meant two hundred and fifty years ago . He 'd reason that if he picked up his wife and moved to Phoenix for the climate , everyone would take it in stride . Then he would remember how Darcy MacDonald , his third cousin 's daughter , had tripped right on Main Street when Cam was no more than three feet away , talking to the town barber . She 'd had seventeen stitches in her knee because he had n't moved quite fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right time . In fact , some days he felt that every arrest , every conviction , was a reflection of something he 'd done wrong as a leader . He 'd press up against the soft , snoring curl of his wife , Allie , because she was as solid as any truth he could spin . And he 'd try to push himself back into sleep , but his dreams were always of chains , link after link after link , which stretched across the vast Atlantic . When Allie Gordon was in high school , she was not the most popular girl in her class . She was nowhere even close . That honor belonged to Verona MacBean , with her cotton-candy puff of hair and her Cover Girl mascara and her pink mohair sweater molded like skin to what the boys referred to as the Hoosac Ridge . And today , fifteen years out of nowhere , Verona MacBean herself stepped into Glory in the Flower and ordered three large centerpieces for a library luncheon to be given in her name . " Verona ! " Allie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about seeing her classmate dressed in a severe beige suit , her hair scraped into a knot at the back of her head , her cheeks flat beneath a sheer layer of foundation . " What brings you to town ? " Verona had made a little clicking noise with the back of her teeth . " Allie , " she said , her voice just as thin and breathy as it had been in high school , " do n't tell me you 're still here ! " It was not meant as an insult , it never was , so Allie simply shrugged . " Well , " she said , drawing out her words and savoring them like a fine French delicacy , " since Cam 's here to stay ... " She let her voice trail off at the end , peeking up at Verona from the order form she was filling out . Then she stared her in the face . " You did hear about Cam and me , did n't you ? " Verona had walked over to the refrigerated case , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " she said . " I seem to recall something about that . " A few minutes later Verona had left , specifying the exact time for the centerpieces to arrive ( it was an author 's luncheon ; it would n't do to have wilted roses for an author who , as she put it , was just coming into bloom ) . Allie had walked to the back room of the flower shop , where she kept her foam and moss and desiccants , her raffia and wire . She stood in front of the tiny mirror over the bathroom sink , assessing her complexion . Then , rummaging through a bookshelf , she found her high school yearbook kept solely for putting together names and faces that walked into the shop . She let the book fall open to Verona 's page . It was much easier to believe that she , Allie , had grown older and wiser , while Verona MacBean , in glossy black and white , was trapped in time . It did not matter that Verona had gone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book philosophy was the talk of the town . It only mattered that in the long run , Allie Gordon had married Cameron MacDonald , which no one in Wheelock would have guessed on a long shot . On the other hand , it was no great surprise when Verona MacBean became Cameron MacDonald 's steady girlfriend in the fall of 1977 , although Cameron was a high school senior and Verona was a freshman . They were both undeniably beautiful , Verona in a collectible doll sort of way , and Cam towering over nearly everyone else in the school , his wide , strong shoulders and bright shock of hair always easy to spot . Allie fell in love with his hair first . She used to sit in the school library bent over a slim volume of Plath 's poetry , waiting for him to come through the double glass doors that blocked off the bustle of the hall . He came in every day during the period she worked at the counter checking out books for the grateful , understaffed librarian . She 'd straighten the shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers weaving through that hair , separating it so the strands that looked like fire prismed off into reds and rangy yellows . At the end of the class period , she would pick up the books he 'd left behind and tuck them back in their Dewey decimal places , trying to hold on to the heat Cam 's hands had placed on the protective plastic covers . The truth was that Cameron MacDonald did not know Allie Gordon existed for most of the time they had lived in the same town . She was far too quiet , too plain to attract his attention . There was only one incident in high school where Cam had ever truly come in contact with her : during a blood drive , they had been lying beside each other on the donor tables , and when she sat up and hopped from the stretcher to get her promised juice and cookies , the world spun and went black . She awakened in Cam 's arms ; he 'd jumped off his own table to catch her as she fell , unintentionally ripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Allie went home that afternoon , she realized that Cam 's blood spotted the back of her blouse . Allie had trouble convincing herself that the reason they had gotten married years later did not have to do with the fact that after college , they were two of the few who had come back to Wheelock . Cam had returned because it was expected of him , Allie because there was nowhere else she really wanted to be . If she stood on the bottom ledge of the refrigeration unit for the fresh flowers and craned her neck in a certain way out the window , she could see Cam 's office at the police station , even make out his shadowy form hunched over his desk . It was the reason she 'd chosen this particular real estate space when she opened the flower shop eight years ago . She saw that he was in , not out on patrol , and decided now was as good a time as any to bring him his arrangement and tell him about Verona . She crawled down from the ledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and closed the sliding glass door of the cooler . Absently , she ran her fingers over the sweet chestnut and barberry foliage that made up the greens in the piece she would bring over to Cam . Allie knew the language of flowers the idea that every bloom stands for some quality of human nature . Bouquets sent from the shop for the arrival of a baby were stuffed with daisies , for innocence , and moss , for maternal love . Valentine 's arrangements had roses , of course , but also lilies for purity , heliotrope for devotion , and forget-me-nots for true love . To Cam , she often sent designs that were full of messages she knew he could not understand . She eyed her latest work critically , nodding over the tulips which made up the bulk of the piece . In Persia , a man would give a tulip to his betrothed to show that as red as the flower was , he was on fire with love ; as black as its center , his heart was smoldering like a coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China asters , and fire thorn . And then , as she always did for Cam 's arrangements , she added as many sprigs of purple clover as she could without making the lines of the flowers seem overblown . Clover , which simply meant , Think of me . When she walked out the door to take the flowers to Cam , she did not bother to lock it . Very few people would try to rob the wife of the Wheelock police chief . Hannah was on the telephone when she walked through the door of the police station , but waved her toward Cam 's closed office door to tell her he was n't in a meeting . " No , " she was saying firmly . " We do n't use psychics , but thank you . " Allie set the tall vase in the center of the main desk , where bookings were done , and then walked to Cameron 's office . She gave a quick knock and pushed the door open with her shoulder before Cam could tell her to come in . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of his desk . Smiling , Allie crept around behind his chair , running her fingers through the hair at the back of his neck . She bent close to his ear to whisper . " While justice sleeps , " she teased . Cameron came awake with a start , snapping his head up so abruptly he clipped Allie 's chin . Allie staggered back , seeing black for a moment , until Cam grabbed her and pulled her down onto his lap . " Jesus , Allie , " he said . " You scared the hell out of me . " Allie rubbed her jaw , testing it gingerly by setting her teeth . Cam 's fingers came up to brush her throat . " You okay ? " Allie smiled . " I brought you your flowers . " Cam rubbed his hand down his face . " I told you you do n't have to do that . " " I like to . " Cam snorted . " This is a police station , not a hotel lobby , " he pointed out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior design . They do n't even notice . " " But you do , " Allie pressed . Cam looked up at her wide brown eyes ; her hands , gripping each other . " Sure , " he said softly . " Sure I do . " He glanced out the open doorway to the front desk where Allie 's latest arrangement stood . She was an artist ; he told her that often . The mixtures of reds and blues , of stark lines and soft curves , and the overall whimsy of her floral designs gave her creations a comfort and an ease that did not exist in Allie herself . Once he had peeked at her personal journal when she was at work , hoping to find a layer to his wife that she did n't have the courage to reveal . But there had been no racy thoughts or dreamy recollections , just a review of how she had acted and what she had said to Cam , and then notes on what she might have done differently . Sometimes he woke up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of marriage to Allie he , too , would wind up editing his life , instead of simply living it . " Guess who came into the store today . " Allie moved off his lap to sit on the corner of the desk , swinging one leg . " Am I supposed to go through everyone in the town ? " Cam asked . " Verona MacBean . " Allie frowned . " Well , I do n't know if it 's MacBean anymore , but she 's here , all the same . She 's a famous writer now . They 're doing some hotshot lunch for her at the library . " " Verona MacBean , " Cam said , grinning . He tipped his chair onto its two rear legs . " Good old Verona MacBean . " " Oh , cut it out , " Allie said , lightly kicking him in the leg . " She 's pinched and pruny and her boobs do n't look nearly as big now as they did when she was sixteen . " " Probably grew into them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cam 's head . A glossy travel magazine fell onto the desk between them . Her eyes widened at the white spray of beach and the weaving red sloop splayed across the front cover . She picked it up and curiously thumbed through it . " Well , at least it 's not Playboy , " she said . She skimmed a list of all-inclusive resorts , and peered closer at an advertisement depicting a tastefully nude sunbather . Cam reached across the desk and plucked the magazine out of Allie 's hand . His face felt hot , his collar too tight ; he did n't want Allie to know what he spent his time daydreaming about . Allie raised her eyebrows as a blush crept across Cameron 's face . " I 'll be damned , " she said . " You 're trying to keep a secret . " She leaned close to Cam . " Not that it 's up to me or anything , but I 'd rather go sailing than skiing . " She hesitantly moved forward an inch , keeping her eyes open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , Cam let her breath brush his mouth and then he kissed her quickly and pushed her back . " Not here , " he murmured . " Then where ? " Allie whispered , before she could stop herself . They both looked away , remembering the previous night . Allie 's hands had stolen across the bed , slipping under the blue T-shirt he was wearing , moving in quiet circles . That was her invitation . And Cam had simply turned toward her , his eyes setting a distance , his fingers staying her own . " Oh , " she had said , her hand dropping away . " It 's not you , " he 'd explained . " I 'm just exhausted . " Allie wondered where the myth that men wanted to make love more than women came from , since in her experience it was always the other way around . She did not like being less beautiful than her husband , or being the one who always made an advance . Sometimes Cam did not even bother to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . She questioned if it might have been different if she were a classic beauty , or if she were sexy . She told herself that she 'd lose ten pounds and cut her hair and mold herself into someone irresistible , and then when Cam came grabbing for her she 'd simply turn away . Maybe she 'd find someone else . And then she 'd laugh at the very thought of letting anyone touch her the way Cameron MacDonald had . As if she had conjured it , Cam reached for her wrist and began to stroke it with his thumb . He did not know what else to do . There were some things he just could not tell Allie , not even after five years . There were some times he needed to be alone with thoughts of what he might have otherwise done with his life , and unfortunately that was often in the hollow of the night when Allie needed more from him . But in spite of what she thought when he rolled away from her , there was never any question in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little like taking the same seat day after day on a commuter train you could n't imagine how it might feel to be in the row behind , you could swear that the dimensions and hollows of the seat were made just for you , you came back to it repeatedly with a whoosh of comfort and relief that it was still available . Allie was staring at him . If only she 'd stop looking at him like that , her eyes catching his excuses and throwing them to the wind . He wished he could make her happy , or even spend as much time trying to as she did for him . Cam dug his thumbs under the loops of his heavy ammunition belt ; out of the corner of his eye he saw a two-page spread of Acadia National Park . " I 'm sorry , " he said . No , Allie thought , I am . The woman stood behind the counter of the flower shop with her hands flying over a mix of fan palm , angel wings , bells of Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Formica and the black and white tiles of the floor . For a moment , Allie stood shocked in the doorway of her own store , watching a stranger do her job . Then she focused on the arrangement to the right of the cash register . It was bell-shaped and quiet , a delicate arch of every shade of greenery that Allie had stored in the refrigerated case . At two spots , a splash of bright red caladium peeked from behind feathers of grass , shocking as blood . Allie took a step forward , and the woman jumped , her hand at her throat . " You 're in my place , " Allie said . The woman smiled hesitantly . " Well , then ... I 'll move . " She hastily gathered up the tools she 'd filched from the back room , and in her hurry dropped a pair of shears on the floor . " Sorry , " she murmured , dipping below the line of the counter to pick them up . She stepped around the counter and handed them to Allie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing Allie had ever seen some stranger walking into the store and making her own flower arrangement and yet this woman seemed to blend into the shadows , like this had all been a mistake and out of her range of control . Allie glanced at the plum beret on the woman 's hair , the nails bitten to the quick , the heavy knapsack slung against her right foot . She was about the same age as Allie , but certainly not from Wheelock or anywhere nearby ; Allie would have remembered someone with eyes the wet violet color of prairie gentians . Allie walked up to the counter , letting the softer greenery graze her palms . " I thought you might be looking for an assistant , " the woman said . She held out her hand , which was callused at the fingers from florist 's wire , and shaking slightly . " My name is Mia Townsend . " Allie could not tear her eyes away from Mia 's arrangement , which brought to mind rolling fields and nickering horses and the hot , heavy press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the actual flowers and ferns Mia had chosen , but rather the skill of the placement and the thoughts that had gone into it . Allie had not been looking for anybody ; in fact in a town the size of Wheelock most of her business came from the shop 's association with FTD . But then again , Christmas was coming , and Valentine 's Day , and she 'd kick herself if she let someone with Mia 's talent walk out the door before she could learn a thing or two from her . As if she knew that Allie was equivocating , Mia suddenly reached down for her knapsack and pulled out a carefully wrapped package , which she began to unwind . Allie found herself looking at an exquisitely twisted bonsai tree ; miniature , gnarled , ancient . " Lovely , " Allie breathed . Mia shrugged , but her eyes were shining . " This is my specialty . They remind me of those babies you see sometimes , the ones with tiny little faces that look like they know all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Allie looked up . " I think , " she said , " we can work something out . " Hannah , who had a talent for eavesdropping , told Cameron that Verona MacBean had written a book on the image of hell . " It 's not like it used to be , " she said , tracing the top edge of her coffee cup . " You know , fire and brimstone and all . " Cam laughed . " Do n't tell Father Gillivray ; he 's looking forward to that stuff . " Hannah smiled at Cameron . " Verona says that instead of physical pain , it 's more mental . Like , you know , if you marry this gorgeous guy only to find out in hell that he really married you for your money . " " I would n't worry , " Cam said . " I do n't pay you nearly enough . " She smirked . " And suppose that in order to marry this hunk , you gave up someone who was really in love with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy is supposedly what hell is like . " Hannah wrinkled her nose . " Not that I can see where Verona MacBean , Wheelock Queen , would know what hell is like at all . " Camerona 's full-time sergeant , Zandy Monroe , stuck his head out from the locker room . " You forget , Hannah , that Verona used to date the chief . " Cam threw a stack of mail at him . " Do n't you have anything better to do ? " " That depends , " Zandy said , grinning . " You taking me out to lunch ? " " No , " Cam said . " I 'm taking Allie out . " He surprised himself ; this was n't something they 'd planned when she stopped by earlier , but he knew she 'd jump at the offer to spend an hour with him . He pulled on his heavy blue coat and locked his office door behind him . " If the town comes under siege , " he said to Hannah , " you know where I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flower shop , he started to smile . He 'd step into the store and tell her he was looking for a bouquet , dahlias and lilies in colors that called back August . He 'd say it was for someone special and he 'd make her play along and give him a gift card and then he 'd write , What are you doing for the rest of your life ? Humming , Cam threw open the door of the flower shop and came face-to-face with a woman he had never seen before . Allie 's name died on his lips as he stared at the tangle of hair that bobbed just to her shoulders , the soft swollen curve of her lip , the pulse at the base of her throat . She was not beautiful ; she was not familiar ; and still all the breath left Cam 's body . As he grasped the hand she extended in greeting , he realized that her eyes were blue-violet , the shade that he 'd dreamed as the Bay of Biscay . Oh , " Allie said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mia . " And that was all she had time to tell Cam before Zandy Monroe burst through the door of the shop , throwing it back against its hinges hard enough to crack one pane of glass . " Chief , " he said , " you 'd better come . " Years of instinct had Cameron flying out the door behind his sergeant , left hand trained and ready on his gun . He saw a growing crowd of people in front of the police station ; from the corner of his eye he noticed Allie and Mia shivering their way closer to the commotion . With adrenaline pulsing through his limbs , Cam stepped into the center of the group , where a red Ford pickup truck was parked . Zandy walked up to the driver's-side window . " Okay , " he said , " this is the chief of police . " With a shrug at Cam , he murmured , " Would n't talk to anyone but you . " " Cameron MacDonald ? " The man 's voice was strong but strained ; an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain that ran ragged over the syllables . " Yes , " he said . " What can I do for you ? " The man stepped out of the car . He did not live in Wheelock , but Cam thought he 'd seen him around town this past week . At the post office , maybe the tavern at the Inn . He was every bit as tall as Cam , but thinner , as if being alive had simply taken its toll . " I 'm James MacDonald , " the man said , loud enough for everyone to hear his last name . " I 'm your cousin . " He took a step back toward his truck , gesturing toward the passenger seat , in which a woman was slumped over , sleeping . " My wife here , Maggie , is dead . " He looked up at Cameron MacDonald . " And I 'm the one who killed her . "
