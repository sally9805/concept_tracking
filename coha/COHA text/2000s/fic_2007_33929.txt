Chpater One Two Mysteries Paco Pedernales was pleased with himself . He had the tired and happy feeling of finishing a good job . He was a fine carpenter , trained by the padres of the San Gabriel Mission , and he had just built a wall of bookshelves and cabinets in the lavish hacienda of Don Miguel Moncada . He had coins in his pocket and knew his wife had a good meal waiting for him . This was a Thursday evening in late March , in the year 1810 , near the Pueblo de los Angeles . Paco 's burro was patiently carrying his boxes of tools . He spoke to it now and then : " Soon , Maria , soon . I 'll take those heavy boxes from your back and you can eat hay while I eat tamales , yes ? You 're a good friend . We 'll be home soon . " He reached a place where the road dipped into a streambed . The light was dim . As he looked hard to find the stepping-stones across the stream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling . This was a pleasant surprise : he would have the company of a friend on his walk to the pueblo . A hard leather loop fell around his shoulders and tightened painfully , binding his arms to his sides . A gag was pushed into his mouth , and a rag tied around his eyes . In a few seconds his hands were bound with leather strips . A deep , hard voice said , " Welcome , brother carpenter . You 're coming on a trip with us . Are n't you lucky ? " A sudden blow to the side of his head convinced Paco that he was not so lucky . The meal his wife had cooked would grow cold , and then she would wonder what became of her husband . It would be a mystery . Almost two hundred years after Paco Pedernales disappeared , a small earthquake opened a secret room under an old hacienda in Los Angeles . On the walls of the room were whips , pistols , and a rack of wickedly thin swords . Hanging beside the swords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black mask . It was the secret den of el Zorro , the legendary hero of Old California . There was also an iron-bound chest filled with papers . In those papers were stories written by el Zorro himself , Don Diego de la Vega , or by his best friend and silent brother , Bernardo . Each of the objects with the papers  --  ornate candlesticks , lace shawls , maps , spurs  --  seemed to be part of a story . The historians who sorted the papers tracked down the last of the de la Vegas  --  me . I learned that el Zorro was my ancestor . In that treasure trove of stories I read all the wild and brave tales of el Zorro , that black-masked hero , a fighter for justice and defender of the weak . But the best stories were the tales of Diego and Bernardo when they were young  --  how they grew up on the vast de la Vega rancho and in the Gabrieleo Indian villages , the tricks they played and the mischief they made . This was before Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just cub foxes . They were only boys in the stories , but justice meant so much to them , even then . The first story was linked to one of those objects in the chest : a strange branding iron . It explained why Paco Pedernales was kidnapped on his walk home , long ago .
