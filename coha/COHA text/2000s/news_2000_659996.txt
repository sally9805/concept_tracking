STAR RATINGS **** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor DUD The Worst <p> All About Eve ( Not rated ) Director : Joseph L. Manciewicz . With Bette Davis , George Sanders , Anne Baxter , Celeste Holm , Hugh Marlowe , Thelma Ritter , Marilyn Monroe . ( 138 min . ) Sterritt **** Heaped with Oscars in 1950 , this classic show-business drama continues to hold up splendidly thanks to its savvy dialogue , indelible performances , and sardonic story about a clever young actress ( Baxter ) who worms her way into the life of a glamorous Broadway star ( Davis ) who 's beginning to show her age . They do n't make ' em like this anymore ! Bamboozled ( R ) Director : Spike Lee . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapaport , Tommy Davidson , Susan Batson . Mos Def. ( 135 min . ) Sterritt *** Spurred by a mixture of personal and professional motives , an African-American writer dreams up an outrageous TV concept - a modern-day minstrel show - and contrary to his expectations it becomes a smash , making blatant racism the hottest thing in entertainment . The movie mixes in-your-face comedy with over-the-top plot twists and outspoken social commentary . It 's a unique blend of history and hysteria , and there 's no escaping the dead-serious ideas that run beneath its flamboyant surface . Meet the Parents ( PG-13 ) Director : Jay Roach . With Ben Stiller , Robert De Niro , Nicole DeHuff , Blythe Danner , Owen Wilson . ( 108 min . ) Staff ***1/2 Pam 's dad : ex-CIA , a character somewhat reminiscent of the cat-loving James Bond nemesis Ernst Blofeld , absolutely paranoid , not likely to smile or chuckle .

By Katherine Dillin Requiem for a Dream ( R ) Director Darren Aronofsky . With Ellen Burstyn , Marlon Wayans , Jennifer Connelly , Jared Leto. ( 102 min . ) Sterritt ** This deliberately disturbing melodrama focuses on New Yorkers with different kinds of addictions : an aging woman hooked on fantasies of being thin and famous , and two young men hooked on drug dealing . Solid acting helps the story stay earthbound when Aronofsky 's filmmaking gets addicted to its own flashy cynicism , but the picture sometimes seems as dazed and confused as the situations it wants to criticize . Based on Hubert Selby Jr . ' s fierce novel " Last Exit to Brooklyn . " Taboo ( Gohatto ) ( Not rated ) Director : Nagisa Oshima . With Beat Takeshi , Ryuhei Matsuda , Shinji Takeda , Tadanobu Asano. ( 100 min . ) Sterritt *** The irony-tinged tale of a 19th-century warrior whose entrance into a samurai legion sparks multiple rivalries among colleagues who court his affections . The movie 's most striking assets are its lyrical visual style , which forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Beat Takeshi 's smooth and expressive performance as a senior warrior . What dominates the picture , though , is its surprising and revealing look at gay impulses in the ferocious samurai world . In Japanese with English subtitles Two Family House ( R ) Director : Frank De Felitta . With Michael Rispoli , Katherine Narducci , Kelly MacDonald , Kevin Conway . ( 104 min . ) Sterritt *** Longing for a more exciting life , a would-be singer buys a run-down house big enough to set up his own neighborhood saloon where his friends can congregate , his income can swell , and he can provide the entertainment . But he and his wife have to deal with the couple who already live there , one of whom is an abused ( white ) woman who gives birth to an adorable ( black ) baby , sparking eruptions of bigotry in almost everyone they know . De Felitta dodges the temptations of sentiment and preachiness . Urban Legends : Final Cut ( R ) Director : John Ottman . With Jennifer Morrison , Matthew Davis , Hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Morrison is a film student at a school that pays lip service to the " master of suspense " ( " What would Hitchcock do ? " ) but practices the art of making bad pictures ( like this one ) . As Morrison directs her thesis film , someone keeps bumping off her cast and crew . This mess of a movie occasionally works as a satire of film schools and moviemaking , but someone should have pushed " delete " before it got out of the word processor . By M.K. Terrell VSex/Nudity : 2 sex scenes . VViolence : 13 scenes with violence , including clubbing and stabbing . VProfanity : 52 expressions , some harsh . VDrugs : 5 scenes with alcohol and/or tobacco , 1 with alcohol and drugs . Yi Yi ( A One and a Two ) ( Not rated ) Director : Edward Yang . With Wu Nienjen , Issey Ogata , Elaine Jin , Kelly Lee , Chen Xisheng. ( 173 min . ) Sterritt **** The insightful story of a Taiwanese family facing various challenges : a grandmother is seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her father 's computer company is considering a risky venture , and touches of jealousy are affecting the household 's moods . These ingredients could have added up to a heated domestic melodrama , but Yang favors a gentle and introspective style that shows how deep and strong everyday emotions can run . A memorable treat . In Taiwanese , Mandarin , Japanese , and English with English subtitles <p> Almost Famous ( R ) Director : Cameron Crowe . With Billy Crudup , Kate Hudson , Patrick Fugit , Frances McDormand , Jason Lee . ( 122 min . ) Sterritt *** The adventures of a very young rock-music journalist who accompanies a second-rate band on tour in the early ' 70s , chasing his story through a maze of distractions ranging from groupies and parties to the group 's insecurity about its future . Crowe 's screenplay is loosely based on his past experiences , and a sense of authenticity and sincerity shines through the movie 's Hollywood veneer . Fugit gives a starmaking performance as the teenage reporter , and Crudup and Lee are excellent as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all is Hoffman as Lester Bangs , the legendary rock critic who sees gloomy prospects for a pop scene that 's getting too grown-up for its own good . VSex/Nudity : 1 sex scene , 2 with implied sex , 3 scenes with nudity . VViolence : 1 scuffle and 1 instance of a girl getting her stomach pumped for overdose . VProfanity : 37 expressions , mostly harsh . VDrugs : 18 scenes with alcohol , 12 with tobacco , 5 with drugs . Duets ( R ) Director : Bruce Paltrow . With Paul Giamatti , Gwyneth Paltrow , Andre Braugher , Maria Bello , Huey Lewis . ( 113 min . ) Sterritt ** A burned-out businessman , a gun-toting crook , an idealistic cab driver , and a hooker-turned-chanteuse are among the denizens of this meandering comedy-drama , which uses karaoke singing as a ready-made metaphor for the notion that life 's true pleasures may have little to do with professional ambition . The movie is too crisp and calculated to match the moods of its wild and woolly characters , and its interwoven subplots lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprightly songs , though . Staff ** Comical , surfacey , lacks character development . The Exorcist ( R ) Director : William Friedkin . With Linda Blair , Max von Sydow , Ellen Burstyn , Jason Miller , Kitty Winn. ( 130 min . ) Sterritt ** In both its original 1973 version and its expanded 2000 edition , this hugely popular horror yarn is less a cleverly spun story than a disjointed collection of shockeroos , surrounding a few ghoulishly effective moments with overcooked plot twists and in-your-face vulgarity . More impressive than the narrative logic are the impressively earnest performances . Girlfight ( R ) Director : Karyn Kusama . With Michelle Rodriguez , Jaime Tirelli , Paul Calderon . ( 110 min . ) Sterritt ** A teenage girl uses prizefighting as an escape route from her domineering dad and oppressive working-class home . Rodriguez 's acting almost scores a knockout even though the movie 's directing and dialogue are fairly routine . Staff *** Great story , powerful , impressive directorial debut . VSex/Nudity : 1 mildly suggestive scene . VViolence : 11 scenes with violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nothing graphic . VProfanity : 66 expressions , many harsh . VDrugs : 2 scenes with alcohol and tobacco . Nurse Betty ( R ) Director : Neil LaBute . With Rene Zellweger , Morgan Freeman , Chris Rock , Greg Kinnear. ( 112 min . ) Sterritt ** Traumatized by a horrific event she 's witnessed , a woman gets the deluded idea that her favorite soap opera is real and she 's the main character in it ; others on hand include a loathsome husband and a pair of hitmen . Zellweger is as charming as ever , and it 's good to find LaBute working with a script by writers who do n't fully share his crabbed , cramped view of human nature . His directorial personality still shows through in the story 's wide-eyed fascination with confusion and humiliation . Staff *** Enchanting whimsy , shocking torture scene , fresh . VSex/Nudity : 1 sex scene . VViolence : 8 scenes with violence , more graphic than expected , including shooting . VProfanity : 114 expressions , mostly harsh . VDrugs : 8 scenes with alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( R ) Director : Spike Lee , With Steve Harvey , D.L. Hughley , Cedric the Entertainer , Bernie Mac . ( 117 min . ) Sterritt ** A session with four popular African-American comedians , filmed during the North Carolina portion of an enormously well-attended tour . Sometimes they 're truly hilarious ; sometimes they 're lazy enough to milk laughs from nonstop vulgarity ; and sometimes they try to pummel the audience into submission with humor so belligerent you do n't know whether to give a nervous laugh or hide under your seat . Staff **1/2 Profane , a scream , in-your-face . VSex/Nudity : 10 instances of innuendo and descriptions of sexual activity . VViolence : Some talk of violence . VProfanity : 504 expressions , mostly harsh . VDrugs : One instance of smoking and drinking offstage . Remember the Titans ( PG ) Director : Boaz Yakin . With Denzel Washington , Will Patton , Donald Faison , Nicole Ari Parker , Wood Harris . ( 113 min . ) Sterritt *** Washington is excellent as an African-American coach hired to train a high-school football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turns his racially divided players into champions on and off the gridiron . The story is based on real events , but it 's been Hollywoodized so completely - the coach is a saint , the victories do n't stop coming - that it can hardly be called a real-world history lesson . It has a good heart , though , and makes an amiable introduction to the integration battles of the ' 60s and ' 70s . Sterritt *** Feel-good , inspiring , keeps moving . VSex/Nudity : None . VViolence : 9 scenes with violence , including football injuries and a shocking car crash , but nothing excessive . VProfanity : 9 expressions , mostly mild , some racial slurs . VDrugs : 1 scene in a bar , but no alcohol consumed . Director : Joe Charbanic . With James Spader , Marisa Tomei , Keanu Reeves , Ernie Hudson , Chris Ellis . ( 93 min . ) Sterritt * A cop plagued by unhappy memories plays cat-and-mouse with a serial killer who torments him with hints about his future victims . The story builds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain oomph . The picture 's real interest lies in detailing the villain 's sadistic crimes , though . <p> U-571 ( PG-13 ) Director : Jonathan Mostow .
