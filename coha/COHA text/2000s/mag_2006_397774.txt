A noted cardiologist answers your questions . VASCULAR SPASM MAY CAUSE ANGINA <p> Reader : Three years ago I began having chest pains during my brisk walks . My family physician advised that my symptoms were typical of angina and referred me to a coronary specialist . After two stress tests , I had an angiogram performed at a heart hospital , and the results showed no obstructions in my arteries . However , I continue to have chest pain when walking . My doctor prescribed nitro tablets to relieve the pain . It also ends when I stop and rest . <p> Can you explain the cause or suggest further tests or treatment ? <p> Dr. Zipes : I am surprised that the coronary angiogram showed no blockage because the history you relate about your chest pain is quite typical of angina . There is an entity of narrowing in small vessels called microvascular angina wherein the blockages are present in very small coronary arteries and not visualized in the usual coronary , angiogram . This occurs more commonly in women , Also . some people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermittent narrowing . The angiogram could look normal if the spasm was not present at that time . <p> There are additional tests that can be done . I would suggest you consult with your cardiologist . In many individuals , taking nitroglycerin prophylactically  --  that is , before the activity which causes the chest pain and then waiting a few minutes for it to lake effect  --  can prevent the pain altogether . It is important to note that assuming you do not have coronary artery spasm , the prognosis for people without major blockages on rile angiogram is generally quite good . APPROPRIATE TREATMENT IS KEY <p> Reader : In October 2003 , I was playing tennis with a friend  --  just for fun , not very strenuous  --  as we did quite often . That night I felt fine and fell asleep as usual . <p> Upon awakening , I felt as though I had been embalmed and was stiff from the waist down . It was quite some time before I could move enough to even get up to go to the bathroom . For almost 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning  --  the pain was gone . <p> Since then I 've had no pain , but I walk like I was drunk , Sometimes I take a step sideways or backwards to keep my balance or veer from side to side . <p> I did not call anyone because I felt they would hospitalize me . I just could n't go and leave my animals with no care . It was about three weeks after the problem that I sought a doctor 's help . An MRI showed many TIAs but no real brain damage . What happened to me ? Does it have a name ? <p> Dr. Zipes : What you describe certainly sounds like a neuromuscular problem and finding evidence for transient ischemic attacks ( TIAs ) by MRI fits a neurologic cause . I would suggest that you see a neurologist to investigate what might be producing the TIAs and receive appropriate treatment , if possible . For example , blockages of the carotid artery , in your neck can produce TIAs and can be treated several ways . You must not avoid appropriate evaluation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends or some other solution . If you become disabled from your problem , let 's say a stroke instead of the TIAs. you will be no help to your animals then ! CARDIOVERSION VS . ABLATION FOR AF <p> Reader : My son developed atrial fibrillation ( AF ) in September 2005 . Despite Coreg , Digoxin , etc. , he has not been able to revert to a normal sinus rhythm . <p> I know the risk of stroke is one in 1,000 when cardioversion is done . He asked his cardiologist about ablation and did not receive a positive answer . Since I was not present and I am unable to find the contraindications to ablation , I feel very concerned . Can you tell me why ablation would not be an option and if it is. indeed , less risky than cardioversion ? <p> Dr. Zipes : Ablation is a procedure used to isolate or destroy tissue ill your son 's case , the tissue in the lop part of the heart called the atria and pulmonary veins that is causing the atrial fibrillation . Usually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then directed back to the hear ! under fluoroscopic guidance . The energy used to destroy the tissue is most commonly radiofrequency . <p> Radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF is an involved , relatively new procedure , with a complication rate in the range of one to two percent and a success tale for elimination of atrial fibrillation of about 60 to 90 percent , depending on the type of AF and experience of the physicians . It is definitely much more risky and involved than cardioversion , but it does offer the potential for eliminating the atrial fibrillation . Cardioversion is a procedure that stops the present episode of AF , with no impact on preventing recurrences . <p> My advice is for you to talk with an experienced electrophysiologist . You can find the name of one near you in the Web site of the Heart Rhythm Society . DRUG THERAPY FOR AF <p> Reader : In October 2005 , I was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and put in the hospital for five days . My heart was monitored 24 hours a day , and I was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . " <p> Are all irregular heartbeats atrial fibrillation ? And is it reasonable for doctors to expect a healthy 82-year-old man to maintain an INR of 1.7 to 2 ? <p> I am currently taking Flecainide and warfarin . I have gone 15 months without any irregular episodes . Do you think it would be safe to discontinue the warfarin ? <p> Dr. Zipes : Atrial fibrillation is only one type of an irregular heartbeat , also called an arrhythmia . There are many types of arrhythmias , and they are diagnosed by interpreting the rhythm with the electrocardiogram . One of the risks associated with AF is the formation of blood clots in the heart , which can then dislodge and cause a stroke . <p> Coumadin , a blood thinner , is used to reduce greatly the risk of that happening . Maintaining an INR , which is a measure of the degree of anticoagulation , or blood thinning , in the range of 1.7-2.0 is a very reasonable approach in elderly patients . We want to achieve enough anticoagulation to prevent a stroke and not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to prevent further episodes of AF . <p> One of the problems with stopping the Coumadin is that  --  should the atrial fibrillation recur  --  the risk of a blood clot resumes . We know that a person 's ability to tell whether the atrial fibrillation is present is not too good , and many episodes recur without the person 's knowing it . Therefore it is often safer to keep taking the Coumadin rather than risk stopping it . If you strongly wish to stop the Coumadin , then your doctor needs to document carefully and objectively ( using ECG recordings of your heart rhythm ) that you are no longer having episodes of atrial fibrillation . NEEDS HELP FOR NAUSEA <p> Reader : In September 2005 I was hospitalized and diagnosed with congestive heart failure . I was nauseated in the hospital and also at home . I was also short of breath after coming home . Both problems worsened , and I had to go back to the hospital . They found that a blood clot in the left lung was causing the shortness of breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help a little but never took away the nausea . The problem is , I have to take seven pills every a.m. with food on a nauseated stomach . <p> I would be thankful for any help at all . <p> Dr. Zipes : Nausea can be a difficult problem to treat in some people because there are many causes . I can think of at least four in your case , in addition to the usual gastrointestinal causes . <p> First , nausea can be caused by congestion in your liver and stomach due to heart failure . Second , ischemia ( lack of blood flow ) to your bowel due to blockages in the arteries can cause nausea . Third , one or more of the medications you are taking can he the culprit . Finally , the clot that went to your ring can also go to the GI tract and cause it . <p> These problems need to be approached one at a lime . First . your doctor needs to be sure that the heart failure is adequately treated . Clots are unlikely , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , the medications need to be considered . Some . like potassium , are more likely than others to cause GI problems . The biggest culprits can be stopped , one at a lime with other medications substituted for them , to see if the nausea improves . If all fails , other antinausea medications can be tried . <p> Dr. Zipes , an authority on what is called pacing and electrophysiology ( rhythms of the heart ) , hosts a " heart to heart " discussion about your heart-felt concerns .
