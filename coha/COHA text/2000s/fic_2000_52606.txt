from a memoir in progress 1 . El hombre que yo amo <p> The night before I left my mother , I wrote a letter . " Querida Mami , " it began . Querida , beloved , Mami , I wrote , on the same page as el hombre que yo amo , the man I love . I 'd struggled with those words , because I was n't certain they were true . I did n't know why I was running away from home with a man a year older than my mother . Mami understood love , so I used the words and hoped that they were true . El hombre que yo amo . Amo , which in Spanish also means master . I did n't notice the irony . <p> I sealed the envelope , addressed it formally to Sra . Ramona Santiago , and placed it in the mailbox . It was a Tuesday , the mailman would come in the early afternoon , and by then , I 'd be in Florida with my lover , el hombre que yo ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather bag once used for dance costumes now held a couple of changes of clothes , a bikini , a toothbrush , comb and hairpins , a pair of shoes and sandals , underwear , pajamas . I left my tights and leotards , stage makeup , the showy jewelry I 'd collected to add spice and color to the characters I created onstage . <p> When I stepped onto the sidewalk , I resisted the urge to look back , to run back into the building where my mother , my grandmother , my ten sisters and brothers , my aunt and cousins slept . The stairs to the train station , a long block from our front door , were under my feet sooner than I would have wanted . Once I took the first step into the subway out of Brooklyn , I knew my life had changed inexorably . Were I to turn around and run back into my mother 's house , into the safe , still warm space next to my sister Delsa , it would have been too late . When I wrote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late . I had made a choice  --  a man over my mother . Even if I did n't follow him to Florida , I 'd taken the first step , a week after my twenty-first birthday , into the rest of my life . <p> I knew little about him . He was Turkish , lived alone in a luxury apartment building a block from Bloomingdale 's , wore expensive suits in muted colors with finely detailed pleats and creases . In addition to his first language , he spoke fluent German and French , but his English was heavily accented and hesitant . He 'd won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival for a black and white movie he 'd directed and starred in , made in Turkey , which he was desperate to distribute in the United States . He was a hard worker , and ambitious , I 'd noticed . I 'd spent hours watching him reedit his film , add new music , create subtitles in English , reshoot pivotal scenes with an actress who looked like the original star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensively and boasted that he had friends all over the world . <p> His name , Ulvi Dogan , sounded so foreign in my tongue , that it was sometimes difficult for me to pronounce it . That initial vowel made it awkward  --  not the rounded Puerto Rican u nor the puckered , sharp English u , but something halfway in between , a strangled diphthong . <p> " Hi , " I 'd say when I called him on the phone , " it 's me . " I 'd never say my name , because he 'd christened me something else : Chiquita , little girl . Having grown up with a familial nickname , Negi , and being an official Esmeralda everywhere else , his pet name for me felt as foreign as his name on my lips . When I tried to give him a nickname , he refused . " Ulvi , " he said . " Just Ulvi . " He would not let me call him darling , either , or dear , or honey , or sweetheart . Not even any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mi amor , mi cielo  --  would convince him . Just Ulvi , he insisted . Ulvi . <p> With this man I barely knew , whose name reshaped my face every time I spoke it , I left my mother 's home . I sat next to him , my forehead pressed to the window of the airplane , and swore I could see Mami 's house , way down there in Brooklyn , the tiny square of cement that was our backyard , the larger playground directly across our door , which we were forbidden to play in because there was always the danger that a fight would break out over the outcome of a basketball game . In the distance Manhattan 's spires pierced the sky , while Brooklyn 's rectangular roofed buildings seemed to push against it , defying the clouds . <p> I turned to Ulvi , who leaned over me to look at the city we had left behind . " This is only the second time I 'm ever on an airplane , " I said . <p> " Really ? " He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed his seat back , and closed his eyes . The air around me grew cold , and I rubbed the goose bumps from my arms , turned again to the tiny rectangular window as the plane droned through cotton candy . <p> Days earlier , when I 'd told him Mami would never give me permission to go with him to Florida , Ulvi had said : " You must take the bull by the horns . " I 'd never heard that phrase , had no idea what it meant . He spoke less English than I did . Where did he pick it up ? He did n't want me to run away with him . " Talk to her woman to woman , " he 'd said . " Explain the situation . " But I could n't face her , could n't imagine the hurt in her eyes when I told her I 'd had a choice , and I 'd chosen him . <p> " When was the first time ? " Ulvi 's voice was so soft , I thought at first that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still leaning back , his heavy lidded eyes looked at me as if he 'd just met me , a stranger on the seat beside him on a plane to an exotic destination . <p> " Seven years ago , when we first came from Puerto Rico . " <p> " Hmm , " he said and closed his eyes again , turned his face toward the aisle . His thinning black hair had picked up static from the seat cushions , and fine strands fluttered languidly up , like soft antennae . I pressed my spine against the back cushion and tried not to think , not to imagine Mami 's face as she read my letter . <p> " What did your mother say when you told her ? " Ulvi asked , and heat rose to my cheeks . <p> " I did n't . " I closed my eyes , afraid to see his , the anger I knew was there . He thought it was wrong that I had n't told her about us , but he also refused to meet her . She will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know Mami . <p> " That is not good , Chiquita , " he said . " It is not good . " <p> I would not open my eyes , did not answer . I heard him turn away from me again , and imagined the tiny hairs drifting toward the plane 's low ceiling . Below us New York was becoming a memory , but the words I 'd struggled with , Querida Mami and el hombre que yo amo , floated around my head , every dot over the i 's , every downstroke , every loop , fine threads that twisted in and out between who I was and who I had become . <p> The apartment at the Gateway Arms was huge : a bedroom , a living/dining room , a bright kitchen with dishwasher and an electric stove . It was completely furnished , down to matched towels on the racks , extra linens in the closets , and landscapes on the walls . There was a telephone on the table between the two twin beds . Ulvi picked it up and smiled when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra-long cord was tacked on the wall in the kitchen . Thick , mustard-colored shag covered every room but the kitchen and bath , which were vinyl-tiled . A glass slider off the dining room led to a narrow second-floor balcony overlooking a weedy lot and , beyond , the fenced  --  in backyards of several one-story houses surrounded by lush gardens . <p> The building belonged to Ulvi 's partners , who were letting us use the apartment while Ulvi had a hernia operation at Fort Lauderdale 's Holy Cross Hospital . According to Ulvi , his partners were also paying his medical bills and had bought our airplane tickets . I found their generosity impressive , but Ulvi dismissed it . The reason they were being so nice to him , he argued , was to protect their investment . They had put money into the American edition of his Turkish film with the idea that , once it found a distributor , they would share in the profits that were sure to come . Unlike him , they were not artists , and , therefore , not generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie starring Gina Lollobrigida and were planning to make more with award-winning art film directors like him . To them , he was a commodity , nothing more . <p> " You must not believe when people too nice , Chiquita , " he said . " Usually they want something else . " <p> " You do n't really believe that , do you ? " I asked . He smiled , wrapped me in his arms , kissed my hair . <p> " Ah , Chiquita , you are innocent . The world is not so good like you imagine . " In his arms , the world was a wonderful place , soft and warm and clean-scented . He lifted my face , sought my eyes . " Is not always what it looks . " <p> " I know that ... " <p> " Shush , shush , do not argue . I will teach you everything . But you must listen what I say . Okay ? " He waited for me to nod my head . " Okay , then . " <p> We unpacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawers lined with floral paper . He pointed to my side of the walk-in closet , and I hung up the two dresses I 'd brought , placed the sandals side by side on the floor , across from his leather shoes , toes facing toes across the mustard shag . <p> We were about to go out for some lunch when there was a knock at the door . Ulvi answered it , and a tall , blond woman accompanied by a squat , ruddy man stood in the glare , their arms laden with groceries . <p> Ulvi greeted him with a handshake and her with a kiss on each cheek , then turned and introduced them to me as Leo and Iris , no last names . Iris went into the kitchen and started putting things away . With a look and a nod , Ulvi let me know I should follow her while he led Leo to the sofa . <p> " You did n't have to do this , it 's so kind of you ... , " I burbled . <p> " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wanted to . I only wish we could have gotten here sooner . " She moved around the kitchen with confidence . " I 'm sorry if I seem like I 'm taking over , " she smiled . " We 've had many guests here , and I 'm familiar with where everything goes . " <p> She spoke English easily but with a pronounced German accent . Her lips puckered into coquettish smiles whenever she looked toward the men in the living area . From time to time , she flicked back her shoulder-length platinum hair , which was combed straight to frame a narrow face with wide , blue-green eyes , a long nose , thin lips frosted pink . Like Leo , Iris wore a lot of gold jewelry : bracelets , rings , neck chains . They both smelled newly showered and perfumed , his thick black hair matted wetly to his skull . <p> We returned to the living area . Iris sat , crossed her long legs , and , in one movement , flipped her hair to one side , placed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who shifted toward the armrest . To me , Iris 's sinuous movements seemed designed for Ulvi , not Leo , and a possessive knot formed in my stomach . <p> Ulvi held his hand toward me and drew me onto his lap . The tension inside me eased as I leaned against him , conscious of Iris 's eyes . I could see her question " Whatever do you see in her ? " I was nothing , Ulvi had told me many times . " You are poor and naive . But I like you are young and innocent . I can teach you everything . " Iris , in spite of her perky appearance , was closer in age to Ulvi than to me . And even to my inexperienced eyes she looked like a woman who had little left to learn . <p> Leo told us about Jim , who also lived in the building and was another associate . " Different business from the movies , " he chortled , but did n't explain . He pushed Iris away and stood up abruptly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We 'll pick you up around six , and we 'll go eat . " He led the way to the front door , opened it , and guided Iris through before she had a chance to exchange more cheek-to-cheek kisses with Ulvi . He waved at us , and closed the door behind them . <p> I tried to exchange a look of surprise with Ulvi , but he was already moving toward the kitchen . Their visit and the promise of a meal in a few hours seemed to have eased his hunger a little , but he still wanted a snack . " Let 's just have some tea , " he offered as he rummaged through the cabinets . " Come , Chiquita , " he said , " this is your job . " <p> " My job ? " <p> " Make us something to eat , " he said with a grin as he pulled a tea kettle from a cabinet under the electric stovetop . He set the kettle on the counter . " I have to make some calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door behind him . <p> I was instantly aware that , in the twenty-one years I 'd been alive , I 'd never been in a kitchen alone with someone depending on me for a meal . At home , my mother or grandmother always cooked for me , my sisters and brothers and whatever relative or friend happened to drop in just as the pots were going on the stove . Both Mami and her mother , Tata , were excellent cooks who delighted in always coming up with a good meal even when the only thing to be found in the refrigerator or pantry were bits of this and scraps of that . I now faced several cabinets filled with canned and boxed food , a refrigerator stocked with fresh fruits and vegetables , milk , butter , eggs , and orange juice , luncheon meats in tight plastic bags , and did n't know how to begin preparing " something to eat . " <p> Mayonnaise , I said to myself , I 'll make us a sandwich . But a sandwich seemed like such an American meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing I ever prepared for Ulvi . Rice and beans , the staple in my diet , would take the better part of a day , if I started by soaking the beans , as Mami did , overnight . The image of my mother easily moving from stove to refrigerator to the sink back to the stove brought tears to the corners of my eyes . It was mid-afternoon . By now my sisters and brothers would be coming home from school , the mailman would have made his delivery , and Mami might be sitting at the kitchen table , reading my letter . <p> " All right , Chiquita ? " Ulvi came out of the bedroom , his face bright , as if he 'd just received a marvelous compliment . He scanned the counters and dining table with nothing on them . The tea kettle was still where he had left it . " Are you crying ? " he asked when he saw my expression . <p> " I was thinking about my mother , " I said and burst into sobs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you must be strong girl . " <p> " I should have told her . It was cruel to just leave a letter . " <p> " You left a letter , Chiquita ? " He pronounced the double t 's in letter forcefully , and I felt them like a slap to the cheek . " Did you mention my name ? " His voice dropped to a whisper , as if the violence of the word letter had frightened him , as if telling my mother his name were dangerous . <p> " I ... no , I do n't think so . Not your name . " El hombre que yo amo seemed relieved . <p> The restaurant was on the highway , across the street from a long , sandy beach . Leo and Iris were greeted by the owner with vigorous handshakes and a toothy smile . We were introduced , Ulvi by his full name and relationship to Leo , who referred to him as his director . I was " Chiquita , his girlfriend . " <p> We were led to a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied by two men and another stately blonde , younger and curvier than Iris . Janka was with Jim , the associate in a " different business from the movies . " Francis , Leo 's partner and the only other person in the group who seemed to know Ulvi , stood up to shake hands . He was handsome in the way Charles Bronson was handsome , with narrow eyes that squinted beneath thick , arched eyebrows , and fleshy lips that covered dazzling white teeth . The way he squeezed my hand and looked me in the eyes , the half smile , the slight nod of the head , the way he pulled out my chair and waited until I was settled between him and Ulvi before he sat down , relaxed the tension that had been squeezing my shoulders toward my ears . He had a deep voice , which carried across the large round table when he spoke in a near murmur to deferential silence from the rest of the party . Within minutes it was clear to me that Francis was the boss , Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an employee who spent the rest of the evening trying to impress Francis with his sense of humor . <p> Ulvi reached under the table from time to time to squeeze my hand , or to get my attention so that I would watch him . He was teaching me how to eat European style , which he said was the proper way . This meant holding the knife and fork in the opposite hands from the way everyone else did it . He also thought that I should slow down . " You eat , " he 'd told me , " like somebody will take the food from you before it gets inside your mouth . " That moment between plate and lips had become the most important part of my meals , a few hesitant seconds which he controlled by insisting that I eat at his speed , to get used to the timing . I was to drink when he drank , to eat when he did , to blot my lips , " never wipe , " he 'd said , when his were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in New York the previous week , and Francis and Leo had met with her and discussed another movie they wanted to produce . " She 's a beautiful woman , " Francis murmured . " Striking . " He turned to Ulvi . " Do you know her ? " <p> " We met , " Ulvi said , " in Cannes . " Francis and Leo exchanged a satisfied look . <p> Jim was in town for a couple of weeks , but he and Janka would be on the road soon . From the conversation I gathered that Jim was a representative for a line of portable saunas that Francis and Leo produced . He 'd been having trouble selling them for use in private homes because they took up a lot of space . Then he had an idea . <p> " It came to me on I-95 , " he said . " You get a big girl like Janka here , put her in a bikini , stand her next to the sauna , and bingo ! The unit looks smaller . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pat Jim 's back . Janka laughed , too , stood up to demonstrate how tall she was , at least six feet , easily the tallest person at the table . <p> " You 're a genius , " Iris purred , rubbing Jim 's thigh . Jim 's face went slack , and his eyes sought Leo 's , who nodded his head to one side in a gesture that seemed to mean " Do n't worry about it . " Iris finished her drink and looked around for the waiter , who appeared the minute Francis lifted his finger . <p> Ulvi sipped his glass of wine , smiled mysteriously when he was n't being addressed , listened attentively to whatever Francis said while remaining deferential to Leo , who watched him carefully . A couple of times Francis or Leo addressed a question to me , and I stuttered through an answer , aware that they were doing it to be polite , that I , like Iris and Janka , was there for decoration , not conversation . At the end of the evening , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . <p> Jim drove us to our apartment . He was staying in another of the units , on the first floor  --  " So I can roll out of bed and dive into the swimming pool , " he laughed . He drove a burgundy Lincoln Continental , cushy as a feather bed . As I cuddled next to Ulvi in the back seat , it was hard to believe that less than eighteen hours earlier I 'd left my mother 's house to walk , frightened but determined , into this life of luxury cars and roomy apartments with swimming pools , dinners at expensive restaurants , businessmen who could move an army of waiters with a raised finger , clever marketing strategies , Gina Lollobrigida at the Cannes Film Festival , and the man who now stroked my shoulder , his fingers slowly making their way toward my breast . <p> 2 . Not Swimming <p> The light in Fort Lauderdale reminded me of the clear yellow of a Puerto Rican morning . It had been seven years since I 'd been back to the island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stepped onto the balcony overlooking the pool at the Gateway Arms . New York , even at its brightest , always seemed gray and shadowy , the unreal sky far above , a sheet of silk stretched between skyscrapers . New York had felt like a deep box , the facades of buildings enormous labyrinthine walls that prevented any semblance of a natural world . Even Central Park , where Ulvi and I spent many afternoons , was an artificial environment bounded on all sides by Gothic buildings and the distant throb of Harlem . But here , in the soft yellow light of Fort Lauderdale , I closed my eyes and remembered Puerto Rico . <p> If I kept my lids shut , I could see the barrio in Toa Baja where I 'd grown up . It was shaped like a funnel , the open end at the two-lane road that led east to San Juan and west to Arecibo . Macun . I could n't pronounce the word without wondering what it meant , where it came from , who had thought up such a strange name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candelaria , which meant Candlemas , across from Pajaros , which meant birds . But Macun had no meaning . It was as foreign in Spanish as it was in English , an African word , perhaps , or a fool 's utterance elevated to language . A nonsense place where my early life resided , locked away in my imagination , seldom talked about , but never forgotten . <p> Lying on a plastic lounge chair in Fort Lauderdale , I , a twenty-one-year-old woman , recalled a childhood that did n't seem so very long ago . An ocean lay between me and the girl called Negi who had climbed Macun 's trees , ran up its hills , bathed in the first rains of May believing they brought good luck . I was now Chiquita , and the man who had renamed me did n't like to talk about my past . <p> The sun licked my skin , a quiet breeze rustled the ornamental bushes along the walkways that led to the apartment . The swimming pool rippled in sparkles . I did n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idleness that just being poolside generated . I wondered if this was what being rich felt like  --  a warm body under a hot sun , a cool pool at my feet , nothing to do but relax in a plastic lounge chair . At the same time I asked myself how anyone  --  no matter how rich and idle  --  could possibly just lie there . The thought made me anxious for something to do , but there was nothing . I 'd left my book upstairs and was afraid of the water . <p> Ulvi slid in and began to do laps , his arms stretching along the surface of the pool , grabbing , pushing , propelling himself toward then away from me . His brown body shimmered like that of a hairless sea creature , and when he turned his head to breathe , his mouth twisted to the side of his face , distorting it . It was mid-morning . In an hour , he would be going to the hospital , where he would spend the night . The surgery would be early the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he 'd already warned . I protested that it was my duty to be there , waiting the outcome of the surgery , but he contended that there was nothing I could do . " The doctors are in charge , " he said , and I gave up trying to convince him . " You come , " he suggested , " after the operation . " <p> Watching him glide across the clear blue water , I wondered what would happen to me if Ulvi died during surgery . I would probably have to return to the grayness of New York . But maybe I could stay beneath the warm Fort Lauderdale sun . I could find a job in one of the office buildings we 'd passed last night on the way to the restaurant . I could pay my own rent , perhaps maybe even here at the Gateway Arms . <p> " Let 's go up . " Ulvi stood at the foot of my chair , glistening , his black hair plastered to his forehead . He looked healthy and vibrant and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first time since he 'd told me about it , I believed that it would be minor surgery , not life-threatening . He would go to the hospital and in a few days he 'd be back and we 'd continue our life together . But I could n't picture what that life would be like . We 'd known each other ten months , but last night was the first we 'd spent under the same roof . " A honeymoon , " he 'd teased , and I 'd been happy because the word sounded like a promise . <p> " Make us some breakfast , Chiquita , " he said as we entered the apartment , and again I felt the panic of the day before . This time , however , I brushed nostalgia aside and concentrated on boiling water for tea and on toasting slices of bread . I found jam and cheese in the refrigerator and silently thanked Iris for bringing us groceries . <p> " Would you like an egg ? " I called to Ulvi , who was changing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just something light . He came out dressed and ready , nodded approval at the set table , the crisp toast cut in triangles , the pot of tea , the jam spilled into a small bowl with a spoon inside . <p> " Very good , Chiquita , " he said and kissed my cheek . We sat opposite one another , he fully dressed , me still in my bathing suit . " While I am gone , " he said in between sips of tea , " do not answer the telephone . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " In case it is business . You will not know what to tell . " <p> " I was a secretary ... " <p> " It is how I want it , Chiquita . Do not answer . " He stared me down until I dropped my gaze and mumbled okay . <p> " Can I call out ? " I tried not to sound defiant . <p> " Who do you know here ? " <p> " I might call home . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He spread strawberry jam from one end of his bread to the other . " You are with me of your own will , Chiquita , " he said after a while . " You can go home anytime . " <p> The world caved beneath me . " I do n't want to go home . " <p> " That 's good , " he murmured standing , pulling me up from my chair and embracing me . " Because I want you here , with me . " <p> I melted into the smell of him , into the soft black hair on his chest , and tried not to cry . He held me for a few minutes , caressed the panic that had made me sound hysterical and childlike . " You be good girl while I 'm away , " he said into my ear , and it was then that I sobbed . He thought I cried for him , but those tears were for me . <p> He left in a taxi , and the minute it pulled away from the Gateway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction the taxi took , as if Ulvi could have read my mind , could have felt my relief . I could not have explained the change . A few minutes earlier I 'd worried that he 'd die on the operating table . Now that he was gone , I was happy not to have his gaze upon me , his constant attention to every little thing I did . I needed a chance to think things through without having to explain myself to him . <p> I planned to call my mother and tell her where I was , to apologize for causing her pain and worry . But when I got up to the apartment and faced the phone , I stared at it for a while , imagining Mami on the other side , hysterical , or angry , or so hurt that my own heart would crack in two just to hear her voice . I paced from the kitchen to the bedroom , feeling the space , the emptiness of the apartment . Back home our rooms were rarely empty . One of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aunt or uncle or cousin . It was never possible to stand in a room as I was now doing and feel the uninterrupted distance between two walls . <p> I pushed the coffee table into the sofa to make the floor bigger . The space created was as large as some of the dance studios in New York where I had spent all my spare time and money  --  before Ulvi saw me dance and told me I looked ridiculous . <p> There was no radio in the apartment , no television , nothing to give sound to the controlled movements I performed from memory , the Indian classical dance routines I had so painstakingly learned and practiced for hours on end , often , as now , with no music to guide the gestures . I could hear it all inside my head  --  di di tei , di di tei , di di tei , tah  --  the syllables used to mark the choreography . Dum didi tei , dum didi tei , dum didi tei tah . I danced until the air-conditioned room felt as hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until my legs , arms , and back throbbed . <p> Afterwards , I showered and lay down . The night before , Ulvi had insisted that we push the beds together to form one huge bed , but the narrow gap in the middle still made it feel as if there were a boundary between us , his land closer to the bathroom , mine nearer the window . I stretched out on the bed , my left arm and leg spread over the gap into his side . It was luxurious to have two whole mattresses to myself . Two pillows . Two sheets and blankets . I rolled from one side of the bed to the other , anticipating the middle gap , which now felt less like a depression and more like a long , sharp hill . Up one side , down the other , my eyes closed , my legs stretched , toes pointed , my arms above and around my head . I established a rhythm , back and forth from one bed to the other until a sharp ringing stopped me midway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its black face banded with white circles , upon which shiny , blacker numbers and letters appeared stark and businesslike . I counted four , five , six rings . The face showed every number in its proper order , the letters like eyebrows over them . But the combination necessary to make this particular phone ring was missing from the yellowish moon in the center of the dial . Eleven rings . I itched to pick up the receiver , to know who could be so sure someone was there that they would let the phone ring so many times . It stopped , and I did pick it up , as if the ringing were insufficient proof that the phone worked . The minute I set it down , it started again . Fifteen this time . I imagined it was Ulvi calling , to see if I would pick up the phone . But maybe it was one of his business associates . Or it could be my mother , who had somehow discovered where I was . But how could she ? Even I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . Another pause . Then six rings . And finally silence . The austere circle in the center of the dial now looked like an eye watching my reaction . I threw one of the pillows over it . <p> I was certain that the person at the other end knew I was there and was daring me to pick up the phone . But then it occurred to me that maybe it was burglars checking to see if anyone was home , and they would be , that very minute , making their way to what they thought was an empty apartment . I dressed quickly , found the keys , and left the apartment with no particular idea of where I would go . I just wanted to get away from there , telling myself my life was more important than whatever burglars might find in the spare apartment . But I knew that the real reason was to avoid hearing the phone ring while I stood by , forbidden to answer it . <p> It was midday , the sun high overhead , the air heavy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mall we 'd passed the night before , just a few blocks down the avenue , and headed for it , hoping to find an air-conditioned bookstore where I could linger among the stacks . But the stores all displayed pastel-colored tops and dresses or showy jewelry like what Iris and Leo wore . In New York I 'd called fashion like this " blond people clothes , " because they seemed designed for pale skin and hair . If I wore those colors , my cafe con leche complexion turned ashen , and I felt conspicuous , as if the soft shades made me stand out more than the vivid colors I favored . The one time I dared enter one of the stores , the saleswoman hovered behind me , as if afraid I would run off with the merchandise . Her wariness camouflaged behind an obsequious smile , she jiggled hangers from front to back of this rack or that , trailing my every move with pointless activity . I was offended by her attention , but did n't have the nerve to tell her and walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge them . <p> That night I slept alone in the enormous bed in the vast apartment , conscious that the world outside the locked front door was huge , unknown , and mysterious . I felt so inconsequential that Chiquita seemed like the perfect name for me . I slept fitfully , waking up several times to reach out for Delsa , Norma , or any of my always  --  nearby siblings , only to discover the solitude around me . I promised myself that I would call Mami the next morning and let her know I was all right . By then , I imagined , she would have cried enough and might accept that , at twenty-one , I was old enough to make my own choices and lead my own life . I tried to picture what that life would be like , but came up against murky , incomplete images of Ulvi gracefully sliding across a shimmering pool while I stood on the edge , invisible even to myself , paralyzed by my inability to swim . <p> 3 . Echandole todo en cara <p> Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City , I set out along the Sunrise Highway expecting that any moment a yellow Checker cab would go by . For over a half hour I was the only person walking along the road . Everyone else was in a car or pickup truck , and some looked curiously in my direction , their eyes scanning around for the reason I was on foot . A couple of men pulled over to offer me rides , and I waved them away with a thank you and walked in the opposite direction . Finally , a police cruiser stopped , and the officer asked if everything was all right . When I explained that I was waiting for a taxi , he told me that in Fort Lauderdale one had to call ahead , and pointed to a pay phone a few yards away where a thick , dog-eared directory dangled from a chain . He drove by a couple of times after I made my call , and each time waved at me as if he were making sure I was okay . But I was a dark-skinned Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his attention was not welcome . I was certain that he , like the saleswoman the day before , was watching me so that I would not steal something . <p> When the taxi finally came  --  not a yellow Checker cab , but a plain white sedan with bold red letters on the doors  --  I was feeling as if I had done something wrong , even though my only crime had been to be on foot on the Sunrise Highway . The driver was sullen and preoccupied , so I did n't try to make conversation , but watched the flat , low landscape speed by in a flutter of pink , green , and turquoise . Again I was reminded of Puerto Rico , but these streets , unlike those of my childhood , were richer , the homes surrounded by neat hedges and thick , well-tended lawns . The streets were deserted , except for the occasional mailman or bouffant-headed woman walking a dog . <p> The hospital was set back from the road and looked new . Inside , the floors and walls were shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nun at the reception desk directed me to one of the upper floors . The squeaky tiles , the gleaming walls , the flowing white nurses ' uniforms , gave an impression of cleanliness and virtue to the place . Ulvi 's room was the last door before a tall narrow window that shed bright light on the long hallway . As I walked , it felt as if I were floating on a shaft of light toward the sun , and I had to squint as I came nearer his door . It took me a few seconds to focus my eyes once I entered his dim , cool room . To the right was Ulvi 's high hospital bed , and Ulvi wrapped in white sheets , his mournful eyes staring at my mother , who sat on the only chair in the room , her hands clasped over her purse . <p> " What are you doing here ? " I screeched . <p> " I came to bring you back home , " she said , standing up , her face flushed , her eyes bloated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bristled with anger , and I was afraid she would lift her hand and hit me in front of my lover . <p> " I 'm not going back with you , " I screamed . A nun appeared at the door , and Ulvi lifted his arms weakly from under the white sheets and made a gesture as if to shoo us out of the room . He was still drugged from the surgery , his features slack , which made him look older . Even through the haze , he managed to slur out , " You should have told her , Chiquita . " <p> The nun glowered at me and Mami . We stood side by side now , facing Ulvi 's bed , for the moment unable to face each other . <p> " Mr. Dogan needs his rest , " the nun said . " Please leave . " She settled the sheets around him , and I walked out , followed by Mami , who carried a small bag . <p> I could n't speak , could n't cry , could n't see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps down the sunlit hall . Every once in a while a nun passed us , and I felt dirty and sinful . Mami 's anger was like a weight that dragged on me , even as my own anger and humiliation propelled me forward . I felt dizzy , and wished I could faint so that Mami 's worry over me would replace her rage , which was as solid and transparent as the hospital 's gleaming glass doors . I kept seeing Ulvi 's face , drawn and dark over the stark white sheets , the displeasure on his drug-slackened lips , his gesture shooing us both out of the room . The nun 's long fingers had pulled the covers up around his shoulders and trapped his arms inside , while her translucent face scowled at me and Mami . The nun in her virginal robes , Ulvi wrapped in white sheets , stood in stark contrast to me and Mami , both of us practically glowing with fury , disappointment , and humiliation . We climbed into a taxi that was , through some miracle , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address . In silence Mami and I were taken to the Gateway Arms , each looking out a different window , our backs to one another , waiting for the privacy of a locked door . <p> No sooner had we entered the apartment than I began to yell at Mami . Did n't even give her time to settle her things or to look around . Did n't try to speak calmly , " woman to woman , " did n't try to " take the bull by the horns . " Or maybe that 's what the phrase meant . I was a toreador and she was a bull and I goaded her , made her angrier than she was by being disrespectful , offensive , and insolent . How could she do this to me , I began , to show up unannounced , to sit scowling in front of a man who had just undergone an operation ? What made her think I would return with her ? What would I be returning to ? A crowded house in a ghetto , no privacy , no room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face fixed into a frown , her eyes narrowed , she stared at me as if seeing me for the first time . I was out of control and felt it . I 'd never spoken to her this way . Since we 'd arrived in the United States , I 'd been so conscious of how hard she worked to make sure that my ten sisters and brothers and I had what we needed , that I had n't dared complain about how the move had affected me . I now told her that silence had n't meant acceptance , that every little humiliation I 'd suffered in the United States was her fault . That leaving Puerto Rico had been her idea . That we had n't progressed much beyond who we were in the barrio where we 'd last lived . That I would have much rather stayed with my father in that remote primitive barrio than endure the daily degradations of being a Puerto Rican in New York . I screamed that getting a good education was not worth the price of losing myself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had promised , but had gotten worse . <p> How much resentment had I stored over the previous seven years ? Enough to wound my mother so that she was unable to answer my tirade with anything more than a hurt look and trembling hands . When I took a breath , she opened her mouth , hesitated , then yelled back . <p> " After all I 've sacrificed for you , this is how you repay me . " <p> " For me ? For me ? " I screeched . " I have nothing . I am nothing . I 'm lucky a man like Ulvi took interest in me . Just look around here , " I said , " look at where I am . A huge apartment with a swimming pool ! This is better than anything you ever gave me ! Just look ! Have we ever lived anywhere like this ? " <p> And Mami did stop and look around at the enormous apartment , at the picture window leading to the narrow balcony , at the shiny new kitchen with dishwasher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , her voice tight , " you gave yourself to him ? " <p> I could n't answer , did n't know if what she said was true or not . " I love him , " I finally whimpered . <p> " He 's taking advantage of you , " she warned . And I responded that if he were , it was all right with me . What else had I to give him but myself ? The hurt look returned to her face , but she was n't about to be silenced by me . <p> " What kind of man will take you away from your family and not marry you ? " she asked , and I screamed that marriage had n't seemed so important for her with the three men she 'd lived with . She slapped me , and I fell on my buttocks and covered my head with my hands . She stood over me . " Do n't you ever speak to me like that again . I do n't care how old you are , even when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Now pack your things and let 's go ! " <p> " I 'm not leaving ! You ca n't make me ! " I screamed . " I 'll kill myself . " I ran to the kitchen and pulled out a knife , a butter knife with a serrated edge , but a knife nevertheless . Had I tried to cut my wrists , as I threatened to do , I would have merely scratched the skin . But Mami fought me for it as if it were a machete , and took it from my hands . <p> " You would kill yourself over him ? " she asked with a mixture of wonder and disdain . The minute she spoke those words , I stopped fighting . I leaned against the wall , my hands over my face , and sobbed . I had not only disappointed Mami by choosing Ulvi over her , I was choosing him above life . In that instant I was certain that the latter was the greater shame . <p> " Go away ! " I screamed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her purse , opened the door , and slammed it behind her . My heart grew so large that it threatened to explode through my chest . I sobbed with my whole body , had to sit on the floor and hold myself so that I would not break into pieces . Crumpled on the shag rug , I felt how completely alone I was now that my mother had left . Had Ulvi walked in that instant , his presence would not have compensated for her absence , and it was clear that , had she walked in the door , the world would not have felt as big and frightening as it now did . I sat on the floor for what seemed like a long time , crying until my eyes were so swollen , I could n't see through them . <p> There was a knock , followed by Mami 's voice , soft and not at all angry . " Negi , por favor , abreme la puerta . " I stood at the door , my hands on the knob , uncertain whether I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , and even as I did , I hoped she 'd make me . <p> " It 's all right , " she said , " you do n't have to go back . I understand . " I opened the door and fell into her arms , and shed tears I did n't think were left in me . She let me cry , then led me to the sofa , where we sat a long time , both of us weeping . I wanted to comfort her , but did n't know how , which saddened me even more . There was no way to take back what I 'd said , no way to return home now that my real feelings had been revealed . My invective had changed both of us , had distanced me from Mami more than I ever expected . Until that afternoon there had always been a layer of respect between us , mutual , silent admiration for what the other achieved against terrible odds . But my words had torn that wall down , had diminished her achievements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected her . He just happened to be there when I did . She understood the difference much sooner than I did . It would be years before I realized that , by not fighting me anymore , she was seeing something I was blind to . Ulvi was not the reason I had left my family . I 'd been leaving for a long time . He just provided the opportunity . <p> Mami helped me lie down on the sofa and went to the kitchen . Cabinet doors opened and shut , the refrigerator door hissed , pots clanged against the counter , water ran . Within minutes , she was cooking something that , even through my clogged nose , I recognized as the fragrance of love . <p> We went for a walk after dinner , to the same mall I 'd been in the day before . Both of us were swollen-eyed and tense , our conversation sparse , each of us determined to avoid mentioning the reason we were both in Fort Lauderdale . We ambled up and down the corridors , looking in store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the clothes and showy jewelry . As it was getting dark , we headed back , swatting mosquitoes that buzzed in thick clouds near the waterway . Back at the apartment , we showered and prepared for bed . I offered her Ulvi 's side , closest to the bathroom . As I drifted into sleep I heard what might have been crying or might have been chortling . <p> " What is it ? " I asked . " Are you all right ? " <p> " Do n't they have taxis in this town ? " she asked . <p> " They do n't just show up , " I answered . " You have to call them . " <p> " I felt like a fool out on that road waiting for one , " she said . She turned over and was soon asleep . I lay awake a long time listening to my mother 's breath fill the room . I fell asleep to the sound of it , to the deep , slow drafts of air that made her body rise and fall like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd found us , how she 'd managed to find Ulvi , whose name she did n't even know . She 'd gone to great expense and effort to bring me , her eldest child , back home , and I wondered if it would be as humiliating for her to return without me as for me to return with her . <p> The next morning , while the air was still damp and the light from streetlamps battled the encroaching daylight , I stood in front of the Gateway Arms and helped my mother put her bag into the back seat of a cab . I dreaded the moment when she 'd ask me again to come home , but she did n't say anything but goodbye . We hugged long and hard , and when we separated , we were both crying . She looked out the back window of the cab at me standing among the lush greenery , her eyes so sad I felt once more as if I would break into pieces . When the cab took the corner I returned to the apartment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed down with a sorrow so immense that I could n't move . My limbs curled up to my belly , my hands against my face , I lay there for hours , unable to cry and yet choked beyond speech , thoughtless yet filled with images that confused me and sent me deeper under the covers , as if the cotton blankets could protect me from my past , as if they were armor against the rest of my life . <p> <p> By Esmeralda Santiago <p>
