THEY HAD AGNES THIS TIME . Catching sight of the familiar girl strolling along on her platform shoes , looking for customers , Harriet called out to her , elated , " Ag-nes , Ag-nes , " and flapped her arms in the air , her spirits lifting . <p> " You remembered my name . " Beaming , the girl made a U-turn and headed straight for Harriet 's husband , who waited at their arrival gate , his useless walker clutched stoically in front of him . " How you doing ? " she asked him , hefting him gently and getting him settled in the wheelchair . " You 're looking good today . How you been ? " <p> Harriet folded the aluminum walker , handed Cal his briefcase to hold on his lap , and slung her handbag across her shoulder . " Lucky for us you were free , Agnes , " she said , immensely relieved to have snared the girl after seeing Bert , the pasty white boy with the ugly attitude , bearing down on them . They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset Cal with his ranting about how " certain people " were taking over the city ; besides , he took twice as long as necessary getting them to their gate , riding them up in an elevator she was sure they did n't need to use , wheeling them the long way around . <p> This leg of the trip , from Chicago to the city where they caught the limo that carried them to the clinic , took almost as long on the ground as it did in the air . They could 've gone directly up the map from Texas on another airline , but Cal had vetoed that because , if you missed your flight due to agents overbooking , you lost nearly a whole day waiting for the next one . Still , it seemed strange to her to fly east to get to the midwestern state that she could never place exactly in her mind . Uncertain except at the moment of looking at the map whether it was north of Wisconsin or west of it , or maybe , it was possible , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not those states in the middle of things , those not on the west coast or the east coast or their coast . <p> Cal did n't have a hip : That was the problem interrupting their life at this time . No hip at all on his right side , which nobody they told really believed . Most thought it meant he had an artificial one , and would launch into some story about who they 'd known who was now back on the courts or jogging with his new titanium and cobalt-chrome ball and socket . She 'd given up explaining ; it sounded too farfetched , no hip at all . Besides , it was a medically touchy subject , since Cal had in fact got himself a hip replacement three months ago , back in March , at a well-respected medical center in one of Texas 's largest cities-a successful operation but then the area had gone and got infected . Nobody wanted to consider the occurrence of such horrors in routine operations , not among their friends . And no one , especially Cal , wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body could take the stress of fitting another state-of-the-art joint in its place . But when shed explained this situation to Agnes last time , the girl had n't even blinked at Harriets recital ; nothing was news to pushers . <p> Now she braked the wheelchair by the door of the men 's room a few yards from their gate . " You better make a stop here ; it 's a long way to the F terminal . And , un-uh , do n't even think about reaching for that walker back there ; you ca n't handle a urinal on a walker . You try that , you 're asking for a mishap . Think about it . You got to stay with your chair . I 'd go in with you , but they 'd likely throw me out . Remember , you get to the handicapped stall , you hear some man in there on his cell , not even thinking about using the facility , you butt your chair against the door , let him know he 's parked in your space . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cal 's difficulty , they 'd doubled their airfare with first-class tickets , unable to manage even the bulkhead seats in coach . The solicitous flight attendant , tagging Cal 's walker and whisking it out of sight- " You need to go , you let us know " - at once handed them trays bearing china cups of fresh-perked French roast coffee with heavy cream and little plates of butter cookies , while the majority of the passengers in the back were still struggling to drag and hoist their carry-ons into the jammed overhead bins . Yet despite her relief on sinking into the wide , glove-leather seats and knowing someone else was looking after Cal , Harriet had to admit a longing to be back with the crowd now squeezing into their jammed rows , complaining communally about the cramped leg room , the lack of a snack . The way they themselves used to do . <p> Harriet put her hand in Cal 's , his still the tennis player 's hand , broad palm , iron grip , almost bronze from years in the sun . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined that she did . You could n't ever really know the inside of someone else . He 'd had to watch his best buddy , Ryan , whom he 'd played to match point twice a week for thirty-five years , sharpen up his game and find a nationally ranked partner to spar with . That and having to go down to the firm with wheelchair and walker , the partners discounting him with their eyes , their gestures , even as they kept up the jokes : " How many hipless lawyers does it take to screw in a light bulb ? . . . " And then to diminish , inevitably , at home , in bed . Everything still worked , she gave him that ; but unable to get on his knees or even roll over on his side , he let her straddle him and work as best she could . Still , he said , he felt like women must feel , flat on their backs with lovers looking down at them but not even seeing them ; and she had no answer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew one another 's birthdays , anniversaries , registered dogs , grown children , and declining parents-tried to rally . But their companionship remained too set in familiar ways . Every Saturday night of the year , whether in winter storms with hail the size of walnuts or baking summer heat that dried the grass to straw , the couples went for barbecue and country music at the Salt Lick Caf ; just as routinely , once a year in the spring they all flew off together for a big party weekend ( New Orleans , Cancun , San Francisco , Las Vegas , Savannah ) . And everything that went on was out in the open . For instance , nobody gave it a thought when George Ainsley s girlish young wife , Rae Nell , went to Cal for some legal work about her dead daddy 's estate and developed a crazy crush on him and started giving him full-body hugs every time they said hello , and more than once kept him outside in someone 's garden after the moon had set . And in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school , Prentice Murray , now a stockbroker , got tired of living in Dallas where folks were too fixated on money , and came back to town and looked her up first thing . Or when he made people move so he could sit next to her at dinner parties and reminisce about the old days , with even his wife Arlene listening in . But when this physical thing happened to Cal , out of the blue , something so frightening and private , so embarrassing even , nobody 's ears could hear of it . <p> A tall young boy dressed in a white shirt waited for them on the jetway outside the cabin door . With his help and the strong arms of the flight attendant who indeed had been attending them all the way , Cal , listing to one side , managed to hobble to the wheelchair and sink into its leather and metal refuge . <p> " Emmanuel , " Harriet said , reading the boy 's nametag . " That means something of God , does n't it ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy said , speaking in a serious manner , " My mother is a most religious person . " He had what she thought of as an island accent . " They prepare very fine sandwiches at near caf . " He gestured up ahead . " Do you wish to have your lunch before I take you to next gate ? " <p> Cal had had enough of flying . Already checking in his wallet for tip money , he explained that they needed to go to the baggage carousel , that they were meeting the limo driver there who would take them the rest of the way to the clinic . That two planes a day was two more than plenty . <p> Nodding , Emmanuel brought the chair to a halt before a men 's room entrance . " Better you stop in here now , mister . We have a long way to go to the baggage claim . Can you manage then with your walker ? " <p> Cal explained his missing hip and that the answer was no way , which was why he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is no problem , " Emmanuel assured him . " You will hear the sound of many zippers closing when I take you in . " And pawing the ground like a relay runner , he bent over the chair and propelled it swiftly into the men 's room , calling ahead in his loudest voice , " Handicapped is coming through ! " <p> Just being on the road filled her with relief . The sights of the Midwest passing by calmed her , the vast stacks and flashing lights of what looked like an East Texas refinery , although she knew , because the driver had told her before , that all the oil came by pipeline from some other state . The rolling farms with bison ( or were they buffalo ? ) , the sense that they had been set down in some different country , like Dorothy 's house coming to a bumpy landing on a strange green slope above a cornfield . <p> " You should 've seen them , " Cal said , actually laughing out loud . " Just like the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thought it was a raid . I nearly peed myself thinking about it , in that oversized toilet trying to grab hold of the rail and not land on the floor on my ass . " <p> " Emmanuel , " she said , smiling . Cal 's remembering the scene , being cheered up by the idea of it , made her think that he , like she , was anticipating going back to the clinic and even the hospital almost as if they were going home . <p> They listened to the driver tell about how he 'd got started in the stock market , taking advantage of some letter in the mail that offered him a ten thousand dollar interest-free credit card for nine months . How he 'd taken them up on it , plowed it into blue chips , and paid them back in six . He could 've doubled it if he had n't been so cautious . They 'd heard this the last time , but it was a good story , and when he said he just chauffeured to get himself spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company was shorthanded , Harriet guessed that part of the reason he drove was to get the chance to tell one more time how he became a financial player . <p> " Where 's the bar ? " Cal asked her , poking around as if serious , still in a good mood . He was already anticipating his daily drink . He knew the narcotic they had him on should preclude his taking any alcohol , and he knew they knew that he was going to disregard that instruction and that they probably also figured he 'd consider one stiff scotch over a couple cubes a day to be within the spirit of the law . When he was n't in a black fit of gloom with the pain , he liked to tease her by pouring strong tea on the rocks , claiming it was just a short one for the road . <p> " Who was that one who talked us into taking this limo ? " he asked Harriet . " The white fellow with the bow tie ? " <p> " Harris Page , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them and meant someday to do a scrapbook with a charcoal drawing of each . During all those years they 'd caught planes , changed airports , rushed around in heels and bearing carry-ons , right beneath their noses , though unseen by them until March , moved this whole subindustry of wheelchair pushers , without whom people like them now would be up a creek without a paddle ; would be having to take their own chair , folding and unfolding it , stowing it , breaking their backs and reduced to tears with the effort . So of course she remembered the thin older man who 'd told Cal a person in his sorry shape owed himself the services of a limousine and to forget about that shuttle . <p> They were up at six on the morning of the long-awaited new hip , and after she 'd helped Cal get dressed , and called down to the desk to let them know he 'd need a van to the hospital , she went down in the elevator counting on finding the breakfast caf open . Cal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But as he explained it to Harriet , this business was simply a precaution on the part of the medical personnel : so they would n't get sued if somebody vomited and delayed their surgery , or worse . That it was within the letter of the law for him to raise his blood sugar with a bit of orange juice plus jump-start all his vitals with a shot of caffeine . She did n't try to argue . Bypassing the silver urns in the lobby set out for those guests ( like them ) heading out early for clinic appointments , she went directly into the brightly lit coffee shop , knowing Cal would want his full-brewed , tacitly allowed coffee in a real cup and his fresh-squeezed juice in a glass . <p> Standing at the counter , waiting for the round-faced girl with the thick ponytail to bring her order , Harriet watched as a trio of elderly men in starched blue dress shirts-brothers surely , looking so alike : banty legs , broad shoulders , bald crowns , and hearing aids-pulled out their chairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One , perhaps the youngest at seventy-plus , informed the cheerful female waiter that they would all be having oatmeal-thick , not the runny kind-with brown sugar , no cream , plus a side of extra-toasted pumpernickel bread , no butter . The girl , apologetic , explained the best they could do on the bread was rye . The one in thick glasses , maybe the oldest , with tufts of hair sprouting above his ears , shrugged . " So , rye . " Harriet wanted to pull out the fourth chair and sit down with them . She wanted to learn what trouble had brought them here , which one of them had come for treatment , or whether they 'd gathered here to see an ailing sibling . She wanted to tell them , if they wanted to hear , the story of her husband who had been without a hip for three long months . Instead , remembering why she 'd come , she paid for her order and , carefully balancing the heavy tray with its scalding coffee and frosty juice , headed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the bed where she 'd left him . She had to coax him to take a few sips , tell him the van would be waiting for him , remind him of all the things he could do once he had his new hip installed . Well , she did n't actually name them-mount his wife like any man in his prime , wipe Ryan off the tennis court , barge into the law offices as if his name led all the rest on the door ( which it might do one day ) . But she cajoled and reminded , and reached her hand into his shirt putting it flat on his chest while she gave him a promissory kiss . <p> Once at the hospital , he perked up . One of the orderlies guided his wheelchair into the admissions lobby , where she checked in for him ; and he gave her his wallet and watch and , at the last minute , when his name was called , his glasses . " Go shopping or something , " he told her . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anesthesia and surgical risks . " Get yourself a paper . " <p> " I 'll be in the room when they bring you in . " <p> " You got the cell . You can call the kids . Oh hell , California . They 're not awake out there . " <p> And then he was rolled down the hall . <p> Harriet , her handbag slung over her shoulder , waited until he and two other patients whose names had been called were wheeled out of sight into the elevators at the end of the hall and then all but skipped to the wide open doors of the cafeteria . She 'd dressed down , the way families did here , in tennis shoes , cropped blue pants , and a long-sleeved white shirt , and , taking a tray , she felt like a school girl again . Everything looked the way she had remembered it , looking forward to it , when things got too grim with Cal at home . The fresh blueberry pancakes on the griddle , the smell of bacon and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even scrambled imitation eggs for those on a diet ) , the heavy metal toasters you could use for raisin bread , English muffins , or bagels . The wall of pastries , the coffee urns . The whole of it , bins of foil-wrapped butter and peanut butter , sealed rounds of orange marmalade , jellies and jams . Her tray piled high and fragrant with promise , costing less than one doughnut and a cup of coffee back home . And then the dining room . Those here for tests who had later appointments eating with an appetite , their crutches or walkers close at hand ; shaky , slumped figures in wheelchairs being spoon-fed fruit cups by their kin ; and everywhere , at every spare table , people like herself , relieved to be alone and no longer responsible , wanting to talk . <p> The cafeteria served patients and visitors to the whole hospital , of course , so not everyone would be going to the orthopedic floor like Cal ; but that did n't matter . She figured that whoever shared her table-unless they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Times or USA Today , or worse , of calling someone back home on their cell to report that there was nothing new to tell-wanted at least to talk about how good it felt to get off their feet and eat a bountiful breakfast they had n't cooked . <p> Harriet set her tray across from a woman about her age , maybe a bit younger , in an old-style print dress and heavy walking shoes . " May I ? " she asked , already sinking into a chair . <p> " That 'd be great . I do n't know a living soul here . You 'd think I would . We come every month-my friend , this woman I come with . Wait , I 'm getting ahead of myself . " She reached across a stack of raisin toast for a handshake . " That I 'm here with this woman at all is a miracle . Not for me , for her . " <p> Harriet spread butter on her pancakes plump with blueberries . " I guess being back here is sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a deep breath ; someone to talk to about it , all of it , the whole mess of it . " I 'm Harriet . " <p> " I 'm Jessie Leander . I 'm here with a friend , I guess my closest friend in the world by now , though she was just an acquaintance from church at the start . " <p> " I hope she 's all right , your friend . My husband- " <p> The heavy woman leaned close . " How on earth can you put all that food away , a little thing like you ? " <p> Harriet , pleased , felt her color rise . " Well , I'm- " She started to say , I 'm on vacation ; she wanted to say , I 'm on vacation . That 's how it felt or even how it was . She was free as a bird to say anything she wanted to anybody at all , including this kindly woman traveling with a friend . " I 'm glad not to be the one cooking , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Leave the cooking to us , " Jessie said , and then launched into how she and her friend made the bus trip from , you ca n't believe this , near Bull Shoals , Arkansas , that 's in the Ozarks , once a month . " I fry us up a big dinner of panfish and fried potatoes , and a blackberry cobbler using fresh berries if it 's the season or some I 've put up in jars . Things she ca n't eat once she 's back here . She 's in a clinical trial . She was down to the wire ; her doctor back home , who 's a fake and a liar , told her she had two weeks : ' I give you two weeks , ' he said . He told her not to bother to come all the way out here , that she might not get to use her return ticket-a waste of her money . Can you imagine that ? We take the bus is what we do , out and back , the church pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in a trial , waives her costs and they give me a place . It 's been two years we been coming . Every time we come back , I drop that fake doctor a note on my good paper to say , She 's still here , how about you ? " <p> Harriet ate the last bit of her pancake and the last still-warm bite of her scrambled eggs . She wanted to go get a refill on her coffee or start over with a hot cup-this one had cooled off too much to be just right-but she did n't want to miss the rest of Jessie Leander 's story about her friend . She especially wanted to find out what the symptoms had been , how long that dragged on , how in the world they ever learned in Bull Shores ( Acres ? ) , Arkansas , about life-saving clinical trials . Also , if she could settle down with a hot cup and slip her feet out of her tennis shoes under the table , she 'd like also to tell about the less drastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being without a hip . <p> But just as Harriet started to speak , Jessie Leander ran to the doorway , threw her arms around a chunky , tired-looking woman- " Betty ! Already ! " - and led her to the table . <p> " Here , " Harriet said , rising , " take my chair . I was just on my way . My husband is upstairs , he 's in surgery , and they like family to be nearby . " <p> The women smiled and nodded , but instantly they were talking a mile a minute , their chairs pulled close together . The sweet-faced patient , who had survived the hometown doctors bad call , had thin straw-colored hair , blanched white skin , and dark smudges under watery blue eyes-what Harriet , putting her tray on the designated shelf , thought of as Arkansas coloring , or would from now on . <p> On the orthopedic floor , she signed in at the nurses station so they would know to find her in the waiting area for patients ' families when word came that Cal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had loaded her blue pants pockets with quarters , and inside the comfortable room she went straight to the coffee machine , one that let you choose the strength you wanted and how much cream and sugar . She liked to look around with a cup of coffee in her hand , as if she were here just to take the weight off her feet . In the center of the room on the reading table holding magazines and newspapers sat a black telephone with a sign : PLEASE LIMIT YOUR CALLS TO TWO MINUTES . She wondered who would want to stand here , with everyone listening , and share their situation . <p> In the far corner , two big country-looking men in pressed jeans and work shirts , hair slicked back , leaned forward , their elbows on their knees , while a skinny young woman in a flowered skirt sat weeping soundlessly between them . Somebody dying , their mother more than likely ; if it had been the father , she reasoned , the scrubbed-up men would 've been at his bedside . <p> Smiling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat on the other side of the room by a woman in a brick-red business suit with a lot of clunky gold jewelry , sitting alone . <p> " Whew , " Harriet said , by way of starting up a conversation , " waiting gets hard , does n't it ? " She had it on her mind to go right into the saga of caring for a man like Cal , totally without a hip for one whole season of the year . Expecting here at the clinic , where everybody had come to deal with the reality of ailing bodies , the dressed-up woman would be bound to sympathize with the difficulty , to ask perhaps how on earth did her husband go to the bathroom , you know , how could he even sit without a hip ? <p> But the woman had her own situation on her mind . " You dressed right , casual like that . I figured that it 'd be the same as where I come from : You look the least bit like you 're a no-pay , it 's suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full up . You can see I 've had some bad experiences . You try to patch up an alcoholic , you 're holding a folding hand . " <p> Oh , " Harriet said , sympathetic , yet at the same time thrilled to hear something said out loud in a frank way that wild broncos could not drag from one single person she knew back home . <p> Then her name was called , and eagerly she set off down the hall , both excited that it surely must be over at last and at the same time terrified at the notion of the recovery period to come . Catching sight of the three men from breakfast ( they must be brothers , must n't they ? ) , she felt her spirits lift . How neat they all looked in their starched blue shirts and suspenders hitched to their creased trousers , the remains of their hair neatly combed . She smiled and called out , and they seemed to recognize her , dipping their heads in her direction ; and then she saw that the bent-over one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oldest person Harriet had ever seen in her life , a bag of wrinkles on bones . Their daddy ! You could tell from the resemblance and the way they all leaned toward him , as though they believed that close enough he might gargle a word to them , his boys , now all old men themselves . <p> Cal seemed glad to see her sitting by the bed when he came to . They 'd given him a local , so they explained , but still he seemed out at first . Raising his head and groping for the self-help morphine machine , he groaned , " Dj vu . " She helped him find the dial . It was true ; this was the third time they 'd gone through this : when they put in the first hip , when they took it out , and now . " Tell me its in there for good , " he said , after he roused himself again and she was still there . <p> " It must be , " she said , light-headed at the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could talk to him , and the nurses , to ask how soon he could put weight on the leg , how soon , really , before they would know for sure that things were back to normal . Or at least back to the start of the nightmare but with a new ending . She pulled his right foot out from under the covers and played with his toes , making a big deal out of how he could feel her squeeze them . " I want to see , " she said . <p> " Everything 's still down there , if that 's what you 're worried about . " He slid a hand gingerly under the lightweight cotton cover in the direction of his hip . " seems like , anyway . " <p> " I mean , did they use- ? " She knew he did n't want to be asked about what he called " the gory details . " They can do whatever they have to but I do n't need to hear about it , he 'd told her half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . When one did come in , glancing at the bed , checking the chart , he said , " How you feeling , Cal ? " making it personal and friendly as though they had a weekly golf game ; saying , " He 's looking good , " to her . Another told her to get her man to relax once in a while , to remember , no heavy lifting , no impact sports . Each seemed careful not to linger long enough for questions , for her to ask : Did they use the same incision as the first time ? Did that make it easier ? Was it like a woman having more than one Caesarian ? <p> Cal got cleaned up ; his glasses and watch were returned to him , his wallet safely inspected and stowed , all his vital signs checked . Then he allowed them to lower his bed for an afternoon nap , so he could get some rest and let things take their natural healing course . Harriet bent to kiss him , and she had turned toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one elbow : " Listen , I do n't mind shelling out the same big tips going back . It is n't their fault I have to get around in those damn chairs again . Even if I was getting agile on crutches , I could never cover those airport distances in time to get from one gate to another on the same day . But here 's the thing , and you can pass it on : I do n't want to hear the word ' handicapped ' used in my direction one more time in my natural life . " <p> As it turned out , Cal had five good years on that hip . He developed a punishing serve , he put in more hours at the firm than the greenest law clerk , he got his cojones back to his and her satisfaction , and he worked his way through a generous amount of single-malt scotch . Then , late one Saturday morning he lay down his racket at three games to three , his serve , walked into the locker room , sat down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was that of someone listening in disbelief as his heart stopped . <p> Everybody said , " Sixty-two is too young . " They said , " He lived a good life . " The friends supported Harriet as best they could . When Rae Nell decided to cry louder than the widow at the funeral , someone took her aside and suggested it was time for her and her husband George to take a second honeymoon trip . Then when Prentices wife Arlene began to forget more than she remembered , someone helped him move her to a place where she had help with mealtimes , baths , and bedtimes . Prentice said his wife thought he was her brother and kept asking him whatever happened to that football player with the wavy hair she 'd dated all through the university , and he 'd tell her the boy had ended up a stockbroker in Dallas . He 'd recount this , brushing back imaginary hair over his bald crown , at some dinner party where he 'd been invited with Harriet . Everyone felt comfortable about them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same way they were included on the weekend trips , this year to San Luis Potosi , with them in separate rooms , of course . <p> By herself , Harriet sometimes went mad with wanting to talk about the whole of it , about the loss of Cal , about the fact that some of her former life she missed like she would an arm and a leg , that some of it she felt relieved to have left behind . Sometimes she 'd pore over her notebook of charcoal sketches , murmuring the names of the pushers , remembering their faces : Muriel , Dan , Lydia , Tiffany , James , Nelly , Harris Page , Bert , Agnes , Emmanuel , LaToya , Reggie . And herself , she 'd even drawn herself ( as a middle-aged woman in blue pants and tennis shoes ) , because once she 'd got to push Cal down the hall to a row of windows looking out at the midwestern skyline-to remind him that soon , soon he 'd be out of there-on a late afternoon in the happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was showered and in her robe , she 'd unfold the old wheelchair she stored in the back hall closet , get herself settled in it , and roll around on the hardwood floors at top speed , talking over her shoulder . " Agnes , " she might suggest , " how about us locating a cup of real coffee , seeing as how I 'm wide awake anyway . " Or she might stop to confide , " I do n't know how I can bear this for the rest of my life , the same old people saying the same old things . " And she did n't have to worry : Pushers had heard it all . <p> Author Affiliation
