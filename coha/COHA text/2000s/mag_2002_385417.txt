// ALAN JACKSON MAY BE A SELF-CONFESSED CHAMPION of the redneck , but he 's also a Georgia gentleman . And so , right when he should be savoring his greatest career triumph , he 's sheepish in victory , cognizant that it came at somebody else 's expense . " I did n't know who Creed was , to be honest with you , " says the soft-spoken country superstar . " It 's probably not nice to say , but I just had never heard of them . And I kinda felt bad for " em . " No , he 's not kidding . Jackson had this reaction after his new album , Drive , sold 423,000 copies out of the gate in midJanuary and drove the spiritually inclined rockers out of the No. 1 spot on Billboard 's pop chart after a two-month reign . You might as well have told him he 'd just pulled taffy from a baby . " Somebody said they were going for a record number of weeks or something , and I knocked " em out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new act , I guess , and it 's probably a big thing for them . " Jackson seems so chivalrously predisposed toward abdicating his chart throne you almost picture him throwing an embroidered Nudie 's jacket over a mud puddle for Creed frontman Scott Stapp to step across . " I 've been around , so it does n't really matter to me , " Jackson explains . " I mean , the pop charts-I 'm glad to be there , I guess , but I never understood why we show up on there anyway . " That puzzlement may be shared by millions of urban rock and hip-hop partialists , all of them wondering : Hey , was n't this whole hick thing supposed to have bought the farm by now ? The stats have had country music on the wane , if not quite the ropes , for several years now , the Garth-driven surge of the early ' ' 90s already consigned to the history books . Lately , only country 's reigning female sexpots seemed to have a shot at impacting mainstream media and going multiplatinum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing babies ( and , in the latter case , lawsuits ) faster than new albums , it 's been a long spell between superstar releases , auguring an even more severe downturn for beleaguered Nashville . It was time for the menfolk to step back up to the plate . Enter a hero in a white hat . Last fall , Jackson was coming off a string of largely rowdy country radio singles that were all great fun but did n't much reflect the more ruminative side of his reticent personality . And then , after Sept. 11 , that , like a hundred billion other things , changed . Coming out of the same melancholy that most of his countrymen felt , Jackson wrote and recorded " Where Were You ( When the World Stopped Turning ) , " a ballad that crystallized this moment in history like no other song , with its mixture of shell shock and hope . It rocketed to No. 1 on the country chart-no surprise , given that Jackson had already had 27 tunes hit that mark in a career spanning almost 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which spiritually parched non-country fans succumbed to it too . Rock &; roll had n't been able to muster anything better than " Freedom , " Paul McCartney 's far less nuanced fist-puncher . For the first time in years , country was clearly providing more topical and relevant reportage about the American mood than any other music . Suddenly the lanky hat act whose last single had been the hilariously down-market " It 's Alright to Be a Redneck " was our unlikely new poet laureate . When Jackson sings " Where Were You " the world does n't come to a halt , but things do tend to move a lot slower . Inside L.A. 's cavernous Staples Center on the day before the Grammys , stagehands and assorted guests largely stop what they 're doing as Jackson rehearses the tune in front of a small orchestra , singing lines by now familiar to the ear of any country aficionado , and which ring familiar to the hearts , at least , of those hearing it for the first time . " Did you stand there in shock at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shout out in anger , in fear for your neighbor/Or did you just sit down and cry ... " Solemnity sweeps through the basketball palace as folks stop to absorb his litany of just about every emotional reaction the tragedies provoked , from sobbing to paralysis , gun-buying to survivors ' guilt , pride to prayer . Photograph A GRAND OLE TIME ( 1 ) Wending through " Where Were You " at last month 's Grammy awards ; ( 2 ) white hats abound and ( 3 ) Jones takes a bow , at the Opry // Writing about the Grammys the next day , Salon.com critic Eric Boehlert will call " Where Were You " a " reflective hymn that Americans will be listening to well into the second half of this century . " Not everyone is so moved : Some hear a song fall of Bible thumping ( " I know Jesus and I talk to God " ) , ignorance of international affairs ( " I watch CNN but I 'm not sure I can tell you the difference in Iraq and Iran " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who criticize it , " Jackson says , sitting in a tour bus outside the arena . ( No flags here ; just framed Patsy and Willie album covers . ) " But I wrote what I felt ; I did n't premeditate anything . I 'm just a singer of simple songs , and that 's the truth . And I do n't know the difference in Iran and Iraq . And some people that are n't real religious probably do n't want to hear it , and that 's all right . " He chuckles . " I did n't sit down to heal the world or anything . " Evidently he 's not kin to those other Jacksons . He did n't sit down at all to write the song , actually . Rather , Jackson sat bolt upright in bed one night in late October with most of it in his head . " After the 11th , I was pretty disturbed , like most people . For a few weeks I thought about writing something-I 'm sure a lot of people who write songs felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotic thing and could n't think of anything that did n't feel like you 'd be taking advantage of it commercially . So I did n't think anything else about it , to be honest . " Then occurred the sort of lucid dream where the melody , opening lines , and chorus came to him as if holy writ . " I 'd just gotten this girl who works for me to buy me one of them skinny little digital recorder things , so I went downstairs in my underwear and put this thing down so I would n't forget it the next morning . " It 's been overwhelming , the response to it , and a little scary , really , for me , " he continues . " I 've had so many people come up to me , and I do n't know what to say , other than that I just feel like it was a gift from God . I do n't know why He picked me to send those words to , but I 'm glad it 's been a healing song for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote the track , though he is less worried about accusations of exploitation after getting scores of thankful notes from survivors and victims ' families . And he did spurn all offers to perform " Where Were You " on TV in the three and a half months between its premiere on the Country Music Awards in early November and the Grammys in late February . Some things were harder to turn down than others , but one was a no-brainer for traditionalism 's poster boy . Folks at his label , Arista Nashville , contacted him when the record began to take off , " and they had a handful of pop or adult-contemporary radio stations that were wanting to play it or threatening to play it , but they wanted to know if we could take off the fiddle and steel . I said , You know what ? There 's hardly any fiddle and steel on that record ! If it 's offensive , " ' he remembers telling the company , " they just should n't play it , I guess . " ' Says producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since his 1990 debut : " Alan and I were laughing the other night about the album sitting where it 's sitting and what a wonderful thing that is . But it 's like I told him : You could n't go pop with a firecracker in your mouth , man . " ' IF YOU USED A COMPUTER to dial up the quintessential country star , it 'd be Alan Jackson : a 6 ' ' 4 " drink of water with a 10-gallon hat ( and there is hair under there ) , a rich baritone , a predilection for the outdoors , an unpretentiously poetic sensibility , and absolutely no dormant ambition ever to do a Chris Gaines project . His workmanlike approach may never result in the Great American Country Album , but with nary a duff entry in his 11-record , 39-million-selling oeuvre , he can hold his own against anybody currently working in the field . There would be just one minor miscalculation the computer would 've made : Even a mouthful of M-80s could n't conspire to give Jackson an explosive personality , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a marvel that a guy this legitimately wary of eye contact has managed to thrive in Nashville , land of the three-hour meet-'n ' ' - greet . Anyone planning to interview or photograph the singer is alerted that brushing up on dentistry will come in handy , because there 'll be a whole lotta teeth-pullin ' going on . " Do n't ask any yes-or-no questions ! " his wife , Denise , warns as you head off in the direction of his tour bus . ( You 'd guess she was kidding if you had n't already heard the legend of at least one Jackson Q &A; in which some of the A 's really were " yup " and " nope . " ) Once you 're settled in for what is scheduled to be a two-hour talk , Jackson lowers the conversational bar further still . " We ought to be done here in about 10 minutes , " he deadpans to his departing manager . Photograph COUNTRY COMFORT ( 1 ) At the Georgia Music Hall of Fame Awards in October with wife Denise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mattie ; ( 2 ) floatin ' for a spell with father Eugene , at age 8 // An hour or more later , it 's evident that reports of the death of Jackson 's verbal jousting abilities have been highly exaggerated , but " I 'm awful , and always was , at going to meet people , " he allows . " I do n't think I made much of an impression when I was brand-new , going to meet radio stations , because I 'm not the outgoing type . Even when I was just a normal kid in school , people would think I was stuck-up because I did n't say much . I 'm really not at all , but they 'd just take it that way . I guess I still have a little bit of that . " " People think he 's laid back , and he 's not ; he 's very driven , " says Denise , his spouse of 22 years and high school sweetheart dating back to their days in Newnan , Ga . " But he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy , who never said much and just took it all in . He also had a dry wit about him and would play little pranks ; Alan is like that too . But he has a very sensitive , emotional side , and I 'd attribute that to growing up with four sisters . " His was n't a particularly musical household-his primary early exposure to song came through weekly viewings of Hee Haw and Gospel Jubilee-and his father , Eugene , a mechanic , " hardly ever spoke , let alone sang , " Alan says . Stegall , who 's been with Jackson since before his first record , notes that even now " there are things he just wo n't talk about , " and says the star was initially reluctant to put out " Where Were You . " " Part of it was the worry that he was exposing something about himself , a very moved side of himself . You really do n't know how he feels at times about things until you hear it show up in a song , like the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive , " a song in the great tradition of country lawlessness : It 's about underage driving . The verses shift from young Alan learning to drive a boat under his father 's tutelage to the 43-year-old Jackson on his 140-acre Tennessee farm , letting his three girls ( Mattie , 12 ; Ali , 8 ; and Dani , 4 ) grab hold of his Jeep 's wheel . " I 've been wanting to write something for my daddy since he died in 2000 , " Jackson says , " and most of my memories revolve around vehicles of some kind with him . And I did n't want to write some old dyin ' song for him , because he liked up-tempo stuff , too . " Automotive-themed tunes are a staple of Jackson 's songwriting . " Man , before I moved to Nashville , I guarantee you , I probably owned 300 cars or trucks and boats by the time I was in my early 20s . Some of'em I 'd buy and sell the same day and make a hundred bucks , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not so far back , maybe . He still restores and soups up cars and sells them , sometimes even at a loss , through intermediaries . In other words , there are a lot of folks out there who have no idea they 're driving vehicles reconditioned by a country king . It 's a compulsion , he reckons . " I 've had this disease all my life about bringing things back to life . " AFTER HIS SECOND RUN-THROUGH OF " WHERE WERE You " at the Staples Center , Jackson is satisfied , and so are the folks running the show . " That 's great , Alan , " calls out Grammy producer and director Walter Miller , breaking the tension . " It 'll be even better when the clog dancers come in . " Eh ... ? Inside joke there . The acerbic Miller is rifling on a routine that was supposed to have gone down three and a half months ago at the Country Music Awards , which he also produced . Jackson had been scheduled to perform " Where I Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 album , When Somebody Loves You , at the Nov. 7 event , and in keeping with the tune 's **30;2129;TOOLONG theme , he 'd figured seen at the Grand Ole Opry . This was , of course , to the chagrin of parties charged with trying to rid the kitsch from a show designed to prove to mainstream America each year just how with-it country music really is . It all became a moot point when , just days before the telecast , Jackson 's manager met with the CMA brass and played them a track she thought they might like to have him perform instead " Where Were You , " which Jackson had recorded only four days prior . By the time the tune was over , all four of the men in the room were crying , because it is a tearjerker-but , perhaps , also out of joy that they would n't be forced to parade a pack of square dancers in skirts and checkered shirts past a confused and divided nation . If Jackson had succeeded in getting his cloggers on the CMAs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweaked the sensibilities of the show or the industry itself with his sometimes wickedly funny determination to make country music face up to its yokel past . At the 2000 CMA telecast , he raised a few eyebrows by performing his hit " www.memory " on a set that sported computers perched on hay bales , despite being warned that farm stuff does n't really fit in with the new vision of country . " Oh , I 'm such a rebel ! " he scoffs , self-mockingly , when the incident is raised . " But , you know , it seems like Nashville is always apologizing for its roots , and trying to get away from the wagon wheels and cowboy hats . " Send in the clogs . Photograph " PEOPLE THINK HE 'S LAID BACK , AND HE 'S NOT , " SAYS JACKSON 'S WIFE . " BUT HE IS A BIT INTROVERTED , AND HE GOT THAT FROM HIS DADDY . " // Jackson may not know the difference between Creed and Ludacris any more than he knows the fine points distinguishing those pesky regimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's following in the bejeweled tradition of Hank , George , and Merle , and who 's just a rhinestone cowboy redux . It 's not that he has it in for all newfangled forms of country-he 'll stick up for Shania , just because she 's a mold breaker-but his traditionalist POV is crystal clear in establishment-prodding protest tunes like the formula-satirizing " Three Minute Positive Not Too Country Up-Tempo Love Song , " the crossover-spoofing " Gone Country , " and his searing duet with George Strait , " Murder on Music Row . " " It 's hard for me to sit here and complain , " he says . " I 've been doing this for 12 years and they 're still playing my records . But I know if I were a young artist today making the same records , I 'd have a hard time getting a deal and getting airplay . And my stuff 's basically no different from what Hank Williams was doing in the ' ' 50s . " Part of it is ageism that even his relative youth has n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years ago and had one of the legends opening for me " - he wo n't say which one  --  " and a couple of radio stations would n't promote shows that had an old act on there . They were trying to sell their image as the new young hot country , " he chortles disgustedly . " That was pretty sad . " The moment that forever made Jackson a hero in many fans ' minds came during the 1999 CMAs . George Jones had been asked to shorten the on-air performance of his nominated song " Choices " to under a minute . He chose to stay home and play Possum instead . During the broadcast , Jackson-evidencing that prankish gene he inherited from Daddy , if not a latent neo-outlaw streak-paid spontaneous tribute to the absent Jones by stopping cold in the middle of his own number and breaking into " Choices . " " I was sitting at home watching the show , " says the 70-year-old Jones , " and when he did that , I come up out of my chair . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's greatest living country singer does n't think his young friend Jackson has many peers , at least among his generation . " It boils down to there only being about two of them-Alan and George Strait , of course-that are really what I call country . And the rest of this so-called country music as far as I 'm concerned is nothing but middle-of-the-road and crossover and bullcrap . I 'm proud of the boy . " Jackson just says , " I was n't really worrying about whether I 'd be on the CMAs next year or not . I get tired of trying to pick out a new jacket every year anyway . " But ask CMA executive director Ed Benson about the incident and he 'll enthuse : " Was n't that great ? Alan did what he felt he needed to do and he got a standing ovation . The great thing about it was , he went into George 's song , came back and finished his own-and he did n't even go over his time allotment .
