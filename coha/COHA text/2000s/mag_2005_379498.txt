Neither man would give in , so the crowd roared for the fighters to smash each other again : more kicks , punches , stomps , knees and elbows . They obliged . When they got too tired to fight , they would grab each other and crash to the mat of the octagonal ring , grappling , twisting like strange action figures , pressing against the cage 's netting . Then they would be back on their feet , catching a breath , calculating advantage , their faces streaked with sweat and gore . Both were bleeders . Weeks before , in a qualifying bout , Forrest Griffin , 26 , had suffered a gash above an eye that required so many stitches that few expected him to advance in the contest . He healed in time for this evening 's punishment , and as Stephan Bonnar , 28 , punched him in the head , Griffin cheekily offered a come-hither smile , turned the other cheek and slammed back . <P> The Griffin-Bonnar bout , televised live on basic cable earlier this year , offered three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it online and off ever since . It is also a symbol of a sport 's resurrection : what is popularly called ultimate fighting was chased off TV in 1997 and banned by almost every state because of its no-holds-barred , pound-to-pulp violence . Relegated to outlaw arenas , it appeared doomed to languish forever as " human cockfighting , " in the words of its critics . <P> But at a time when boxing has few stars and pro wrestling verges on cartoonish , ultimate fighting has a new appeal and is heading for mainstream entertainment . In June the big show-biz dealmakers at Creative Artists Agency signed up the Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ) as a client . A movie project based on the life of a wannabe ultimate-fighting warrior is circulating in Hollywood . On Oct. 3 , Spike TV , which is owned by MTV and Viacom and is targeted at men who do n't want to grow up , will pit several hours of live ultimate fighting against the choreography of World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) on the USA Network . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality series The Ultimate Fighter . The first season was a strategic move in the canny revival of the sport . <P> Sport ? When it began in 1993 , the first UFC was meant to be a gimmicky showcase for Brazilian-style jujitsu ( and its superiority to other fighting styles ) , but it quickly devolved into a circus . Wild audiences screamed for matchups of pugilists against wrestlers against kickboxers , a Final Fantasy  --  video-game array of combatants , except for the very real blood that spattered on the mat of the octagon . <P> The cage surrounding the ring was intended to keep the audiences from jumping in as much as to keep the fighters from falling out . " Violence for the sake of violence , " says Phil Mushnick , a sports columnist for the New York Post . " I understand that not everything necessarily has to have a redeeming social value . It can have no value . But this kind of stuff has negative value . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
