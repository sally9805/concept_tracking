" U.S.S. Lincoln to Vulpecula , the Arch-Merchant has dropped out of warp again . Let 's circle back on impulse and see what 's broken this time . " Second Mate Wayne " Pappy " Omthon muttered a curse and shut down the Vulpecula 's warp drive . The freighter shuddered and the lights on the cramped bridge flickered as it shifted to impulse . Pappy turned the command chair to face the sensor console and get a fix on the Arch-Merchant , wincing at the chair 's squeak . He 'd get it oiled as soon as he had time . The image on the screen was fuzzy , so Pappy slapped it with the flat of his pistachio-green hand , a practiced maneuver that instantly , if temporarily , cleared up the image . He 'd earned the nickname " Pappy " by being far younger than the captain and most of the crew serving under him , a point he was still defensive about . But he prided himself on knowing the ship 's quirks as well as any old-timer . The Arch-Merchant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display , which had gone all fuzzy again . " That ship , " he announced , without a trace of irony , " is a piece of junk . " He slapped the sensor display again , then put in a call to Captain Rivers in her cabin to advise her of the situation . Rivers was , as he 'd expected , mildly drunk . The captain instructed him to use his own judgment , and not to call her again unless there was a core breach . Pappy grunted as the intercom screen went blank , then set a reverse course . It was business as usual . Both the Vulpecula and the Arch-Merchant were privately owned freighters operating on the edge of former Cardassian space . The fall of the Cardassian Union and the aftermath of the Dominion War had thrown the region into chaos , creating lucrative new trade opportunities , and new dangers as pirates and raiders moved in . Federation starships were spread thin and overworked , so freighters often formed small , impromptu convoys for mutual protection and safety . Pappy did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy when they were transporting some cargo important enough to Federation interests to warrant a starship to escort their convoy . On this run , the two ships carried power station components , Cardassian war salvage from abandoned bases now needed to rebuild Cardassia Prime . If Pappy found it ironic that the Federation was paying to ship Cardassian war materials to restore Cardassia , he never would have said so . It was exactly the sort of situation a tramp freighter captain lived for . It was Pappy 's ambition to buy the Vulpecula from Captain Rivers one of these days . His share of profits from this run would be one more step in that direction . If they ever got to Cardassia . " Vulpecula to Lincoln . How long are we going to be delayed this time ? " One of the secondary viewscreens cleared , and the angular features of a human Starfleet officer appeared . " This is Captain Newport . Should n't you be addressing that question to the Arch-Merchant ? " Pappy grinned , he hoped not too much . " Since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , I thought you 'd know best . " Newport chuckled . " My chief engineer is putting together a repair party right now . We should know more after they beam over . Tell me , why is it  --  " He hesitated . " How to put this politely ? " " I wo n't make you ask the question , Captain . The Arch-Merchant is a corporate ship . She looks clean and sharp for the stockholders , but she 's lucky to make it out of orbit without shedding a nacelle . We 're a tramp , and independent . Our ship looks like the rattletrap she is , but we keep the important systems in top shape , appearances be damned . Most of the time , we 're all we 've got out here . " Newport nodded . " Well , thanks for being the less troublesome part of this mission . " He glanced to one side . " Looks like the Arch-Merchant managed to plug the plasma leak on their own . Uncommonly resourceful of them . Now if we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no interference , no sign of a problem on the Federation ship . It just went blank . Startled , Pappy glanced up at the main viewer . He could see the Arch-Merchant 's plasma cloud , a tiny smudge against the darkness , glowing in reflecting starlight , but the Lincoln was gone . He slammed the intercom panel . " Condition red , all crew to emergency stations . Possible hostiles incoming ! " Then , after a moment 's hesitation , " Captain to the bridge . " He knew the result of that last command : the captain would at least attempt to sober up first . If he was lucky , he might see her on the bridge in an hour or so . He hailed the Arch-Merchant . " Did you see what happened to the Lincoln ? " The reply was audio only and crackled with static . The voice was high , tinged with incipient panic . " No , Vulpecula , our sensors are down too . Are we under attack ? We ca n't see anything . We 're dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not leaving anybody , but I 'm busy here . Save your questions and send out a distress call for me , will you ? " Pappy closed the channel and turned his attention to the sensor screens . No hostiles , no radiation or debris , no cosmic storms , nothing that would account for the Lincoln 's disappearance . He reviewed his own sensor logs , replaying the event . The Lincoln vanished , without violence or explosion . He slowed down the replay , then slowed it again . He squinted . The Lincoln did n't just vanish . It was as though it had run into an invisible rift in space and been swallowed . A wormhole ? He shook his head . He should have picked something up on sensors . He heard the bridge doors slide open . The Vulpecula was highly automated , and the tiny bridge had only two stations . The second was staffed only during shift changeovers or critical operations such as docking . Or during emergencies , so he was n't surprised to hear someone slide into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong odor of Saurian brandy . Turning his head , he caught the captain 's eye . " Carry on , Pappy . I took a handful of stims , but she 's still your ship for now . " She tapped the controls to activate her station . " Just tell me what you need . " That explained the smell . The stims were burning the alcohol out of her system . Pappy tapped at the command console , transferring information to the secondary station . " The point at which the Lincoln disappeared is on your sensor display . Run a detailed scan on the area in front of it . Look for anything unusual . " Pappy ordered all stop , and kept his distance . If something had pulled the Lincoln in , it would n't do to be pulled in as well . The secondary consoles chirped and beeped as the captain entered commands . Finally she looked up at him , her dark eyes red and tired , but sobering by the minute . " There 's something out there , a discontinuity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran into it . " Pappy frowned , his sharp eyebrows drawing together into a vee . " How big a bubble ? " The captain consulted her displays , rubbed her eyes , then checked them again . " I 'm reading a sphere a hundred kilometers across . We just missed running into it ourselves . " She sighed . " This is trouble . " " Our convoy partner is disabled , we 're facing off with an invisible threat the size of a moon , one that just took out an Intrepid-class starship without firing a shot . Yeah , that would be one definition of ' trouble . ' " He tapped the thruster controls . It was the captain 's turn to frown . " What are you doing ? " " Getting in closer , " he replied . " Somebody may need rescuing . " The U.S.S. da Vinci was a small ship . Even with a limited crew of about forty , its interior was crowded and cluttered by Starfleet standards , a situation not improved by the preponderance of engineers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their use of ship 's spaces . It was n't unusual to see someone overhauling environmental suits on a briefing room table , storing salvaged alien propulsion components in a corner of the transporter room , or playing Andorian Juggle-ball in the shuttlebay . Lt. Commander Kieran Duffy could even remember a time when all the corridors of deck six had been briefly converted into a miniature golf course , complete with holographic windmill . The exception to all this madness , by unspoken consent , was the mess hall . Not that it was reserved solely for eating , not at all , but it was reserved for quiet conversation , reading , social gatherings , and the occasional spontaneous musical interlude . No plasma torches , no alien artifacts , and no extreme sports allowed . That was why Duffy liked it there , why it was the place he retreated when he needed to work or think , when his quarters became too cramped or lonely . The lights were kept low , the dark maroon chairs were inviting , and the clusters of small tables fostered quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the place he came to bask in the feeling of family , and be reminded why he really liked having one of the few private cabins on the ship . He 'd picked a choice seat for himself near one of the scattered windows , where he could watch the stars , and ordered a quinine water from the replicator . Leaning back in the lightly padded chair , he put his feet on the table and sat back with an oversized design padd propped up in his lap . He 'd just gotten comfortable , opened his work space , and managed to move exactly one line in the display when he sensed someone standing behind him , and a very familiar scent of herbal shampoo . Commander Sonya Gomez leaned into his field of view , looking at the padd . " What 're you doing ? " He pulled the padd protectively to his stomach . " Nothing . Just doodling . " Gomez glanced at the table , and Duffy hastily put his feet on the floor . " That was a starship . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretty elaborate doodle . How long you been doodling ? " He sighed and lowered the padd back to working position . " Six months . " " That 's some doodle . " She leaned closer , her body nearly touching his shoulder , and this time he did n't try to hide his work . " I did n't know you were interested in ship design . " " Is n't every engineer , on some level ? " " So you 're designing a ship ? " " An S.C.E. ship . " " We 've got one of those already . " The doors opened , and Gomez drew back a fraction . Fabian Stevens and   Blue came in . Stevens headed for the replicators , while Pattie scuttled across the floor on all legs , popping to an upright stance only when reaching Duffy 's table . " Greetings . I see you are designing a ship , Commander . " " So I 've heard , " said Gomez . " An S.C.E. ship , I 'm told . " " We 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the table with two cups in hand . He gave one to Pattie . " Here 's your ' swamp tea , ' whatever that is . I do n't really want to know . " " Thank you , " said Pattie . " That 's what I told him , " Gomez said . Duffy sighed . " The da Vinci is a great ship , but she is n't designed for the kind of missions we go on . No ship is , really . Tugs are slow , short-range , and do n't have the shops or crew capacity we need . A general purpose design like this Saber-class is small and maneuverable , sure , but it 's too fragile for heavy work , and it also does n't have the cargo , shop , or laboratory space we could really use . " Gomez 's interest was piqued . " So you 're designing a ship with our needs in mind ? " Duffy shrugged . " It 's just an exercise , a dream ship , really . Gives me an excuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It resembles a Norway-class , " observed Pattie , shoving a second small table next to Duffy 's . " I used that as a starting point , but see , the engines are uprated , and the whole front of the saucer section opens up like  --  no offense , Pattie  --  like insect mandibles , to form a miniature drydock . We can pull things partially inside the ship for inspection or repair . " Pattie tapped a foreleg at a part of the diagram . " What are those ? " " Heavy tractor beam emitters , for towing . " " You should add six smaller ones , " said Pattie , " for precision manipulation of objects in space . " Duffy nodded . " Good idea . " " And more Jefferies tubes , " said Pattie . " I like Jefferies tubes . " By now , several other crewmembers had entered the mess hall , including the chief of security , Lt. Commander Domenica Corsi , and the chief medical officer , Dr. Elizabeth Lense , and all of them seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sat next to Corsi . " Idea , " said Stevens . " An industrial replicator , so we do n't have to replicate small parts and put ' em together into something big . And maybe a second hololab . " Gomez sighed , and Duffy imagined he could feel the warmth of her breath on the back of his neck . " A second holodeck would be nice . Then it can double for recreational purposes . " " Holodecks are nothing but trouble , " said Corsi . " We 'd be better off without any . More quantum torpedoes would be good , though . I 'm very in favor of more torpedoes . " Lense reached across the table and tapped Duffy on the wrist . " Put in a Risa deck . " Duffy looked up at her . " What 's a Risa deck ? " She shrugged . " Risa in deck form . Sounds good to me . " She saw the look in Duffy 's eyes . " What do you expect ? I 'm a doctor , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're not taking this seriously . " He scowled at her , but could n't hold it for long . " Besides , I like my Risa in chewable , cherry-flavored lozenge form , anyway . " A faint vibration in the hull stilled the conversation , and all eyes went to the windows , where beyond the nacelle the stars shifted into streaks of light . " We 've gone to warp , " said Duffy . Gomez seemed to be assessing the vibration in the deck . " About nine-point-six-five . We 're in a hurry . " " The inertial dampers need tuning , " said Pattie . Stevens nodded , touching a bulkhead with his fingertips . " Somebody should check those plasma injectors too . " Corsi rolled her eyes . " How did I get stuck on a ship full of engineers ? " " Dumb luck ? " Stevens said with a smile . Captain Gold 's voice came from the intercom . " S.C.E. staff to the observation lounge . " " Right on schedule , " said Lense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors . " Showtime , people , " said Gomez , leading the rest of them out . Duffy sighed and cleared the padd 's display . " One plasma conduit , " he muttered , before following the others into the corridor . " I got to move one lousy plasma conduit . " Continues ...
