OUTBACK IN-BOX CBS Is keeping the exact location of Survivor . The Australian Outback , which begins shooting this month in Australia , so confidential that they even tried to secure the airspace overhead . But we 've learned this much : The base camp for the show 's 250-odd crew members is outfitted with an Internet cafe . Whether or not they 're granted Web access to www.survivorsucks.com is unknown , but the satellite phone linkup certainly raises the potential of on-set details being leaked to Web fanatics . ( CBS declined to comment . ) So far the network is looking immunity-challenged . MYTHS AND LEGENDS A visual representation of the tangled conspiracies that make up the X-Files plotlines looks like the tentacles of an alien  --  at least on the flashily redesigned official website that debuts Nov. 1 ( www.thexfiles. com ) .

We 're not sure if the site required special knowledge of physics or math  --  but it looks like something the Lone Gunmen might have concocted .

Little Nicky ( www.littlenicky. com ) , the upcoming PG-13 movie that brings Satan 's son ( in the form of Adam Sandier ) to earth , Is coming to a Game Boy Color near you  --  which is curious , since 57 percent of Game Boy owners are too young to see the film alone . And this 15-level New York City adventure , which includes a boom box full of heavy metal tunes , is n't exactly Pok6mon either . It opens with a Peeping Tom scenario and spits out the S-word as often as the dark hero burps fireballs . The Teen-rated game Is , however , devilishly fun for adults , most of whom will probably be too embarrassed to borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys to try It out . LOST ART RAIDERS The " Anonymous Director " who created the phenomenally fake Star Wars : Episode II trailer ( www. theforce.net/ theater/trailers/ episodeii/Index.shtml ) that many believed was real has just released a Photograph KEEPING UP WITH JONES Ford // <p>
