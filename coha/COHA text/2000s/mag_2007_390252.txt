Everything you need to know to care for your child 's teeth . For the first time in decades , cavities in kids are on the rise . As many as 28 percent of children ages 2 to 5 have cavities in their baby teeth . What can you do to keep your child 's teeth healthy ? Answers to your most pressing dental questions , for babies on up : Q What 's the best way to keep my child from getting cavities ? A The health of your child 's teeth is largely dependent on four things : diet , oral hygiene , tooth makeup , and the amount and quality of her saliva ( which helps rinse away food and bacteria ) . Since saliva and the strength of her teeth are based mainly on genes  --  and out of your control  --  focus on what you can influence : eating and cleaning . The kind of food in your child 's diet  --  and how frequently she eats it  --  matters . When sugar and starch meet up with normal bacteria in the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure and cause cavities . The more a child eats sugar and starches ( processed snacks are the worst offenders ) , the more often her teeth are exposed to the acids . Eating regular healthy meals , rather than lots of small portions throughout the day , and drinking water ( the fluoridated kind , for kids older than 1 ) , will help prevent acids from settling on the teeth and stave off tooth decay . While a no-snack rule is unrealistic , offer more fruits and vegetables , as opposed to processed treats . Just as crucial : Kids should brush at least twice a day and , ideally , after snacking , too . Keep in mind that the most important time to brush is before a nap or bedtime because saliva production slows during sleep ( it 's linked to blood pressure and heart rate ) , giving acids far more opportunity to damage teeth . Q At what age should I start taking my child to the dentist  --  and how often should he go ? A Babies should see the dentist within six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of age ) , and no later than 1 . Stick to that time frame and your child may need fewer fillings than kids who wait until age 2 or 3 , says a recent study . At the visit , as long as there are no major problems , the dentist will typically count and inspect your child 's teeth ( or tooth ! ) , start to get him used to the office and staff , and talk with you about preventive care . The main goal is that a child have a happy and comfortable experience , says Beverly Mittelman , coauthor , along with dentist Jerome Mittelman , of Healthy Teeth for Kids . The rule of thumb is to bring your child back every six months or so for a routine cleaning and checkup . Q Are electric toothbrushes a good idea for kids ? A They can be helpful for children who are n't yet coordinated enough to brush thoroughly with a manual toothbrush ( kids under 4 sometimes are n't ) . They also often come with a two-minute timer that lets your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose an electric model , make sure your child does n't apply too much pressure when she 's using it . If she does , the head of the toothbrush may not rotate and wo n't be as effective . No matter which kind of brush you pick , be sure that she 's getting to those hard-to-reach places in the back of her mouth ; this might require a little extra help from you until she 's 5 or 6 years old . Q Should my child get dental sealants to prevent cavities ? A They 're no substitute for good oral hygiene . But sealants  --  thin plastic barriers that are painted onto the chewing surface of the back teeth  --  can help fend off decay if your child has deep grooves in his molars . Bacteria , plaque , and food particles can get into those grooves and are difficult to remove with a toothbrush . Though some research supports using sealants as a routine part of dental care for babies , baby teeth are less likely to be heavily grooved , and many insurance companies will only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or all ) of your child 's permanent teeth are in , talk to your dentist about whether he recommends sealants . There 's no drilling or anesthetic required , they wo n't show when your child talks or smiles , and they are n't painful  --  though he may be able to feel them with his tongue at first . Prices vary ; if you have dental insurance , check to see if sealants are covered . Q I see a lot of natural toothpastes in the store these days that do n't contain fluoride . Are they okay for kids to use ? A While fluoride protects enamel , non-fluoridated toothpastes are best for kids who ca n't yet spit . Why ? Swallowing fluoride and getting too much of it can lead to fluorosis , which causes stains on the enamel of permanent teeth . ( What 's most important , whichever toothpaste you choose , is the action of brushing teeth , which does most of the cleaning . ) When your child 's old enough to spit , talk to your dentist ; she may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and food . Also note : Infants under 1 do not need fluoride and are particularly vulnerable to fluorosis . The American Dental Association ( ADA ) recommends that you use water that has no fluoride , or only a low level of it , for formula that needs to be reconstituted . Best bets are purified , deionized , demineralized , distilled , or reverse osmosis filtered water . Q Is it true that chewing xylitol gum can help reduce the risk of tooth decay ? A Yes . The physical motion of chewing produces more saliva , which helps neutralize pH balance to prevent cavities . And studies have shown that xylitol , a natural sweetener that tastes like sugar , may suppress the growth of bacteria in the mouth . For kids under 4 , any type of gum is a choking hazard . But babies and toddlers can still reap the benefits of xylitol : If Mom chews it during her pregnancy and up to two years postpartum , her child 's less likely to develop tooth decay down the road ( the bacteria that cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sharing food ) . Q My toddler grinds his teeth . Should I be concerned ? A Tooth grinding ( bruxism ) happens occasionally in young kids . As your child 's mouth grows and changes , he may grind his teeth in order to comfortably align them with his jaw . While it can damage the enamel on baby teeth , they usually fall out before it becomes a problem . And experts say it 's uncommon for grinding to do serious harm to permanent teeth because the habit usually goes away on its own by age 6 . If you 're still worried , or your child has n't outgrown it by then , talk to your dentist . She may suggest a mouth guard to wear at night , or she may refer you to a myofunctional therapist , who can work with him to balance the muscles in the mouth and get at the cause of the grinding . Q Do I really need to wipe my baby 's gums with gauze before his teeth come in ? A It 's a good idea . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushing , and sometimes there 's a small opening in the gum before the tooth erupts  --  a perfect hiding place for bacteria , which the gauze will wipe away . Payman Pirnazar , a pediatric dentist in Los Angeles and the founder of BabyTeeth.com , recommends that you start wiping your baby 's gums after each feeding at around 6 months ( it takes just a few seconds ) . Dentists say it may even have the added benefit of making teething more comfortable for your baby , since as you 're cleaning you 're also massaging the gums . Q What are the best kinds of fillings for children  --  and are there any new , less painful ways to drill for them ? A Often it comes down to aesthetics . " If you have a child walking around with metal crowns , it 's not uncommon for other kids to start teasing him , " says Dr. Pirnazar . And then there are practical issues : Filling a cavity with composite ( a tooth-colored material made of quartz and resin ) may take up to 40 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( metal ) filling  --  which is a challenge when the patient is a wiggly kid . On the other hand , composite restorations do n't require the dentist to drill as much . And while the ADA maintains that the mercury content in metal fillings is safe , this has been debated , and some parents prefer to skip them . Laser surgery is the newest way to drill and is said to be less painful , though it 's not yet widely available . Because the equipment is expensive , if your dentist offers laser drilling , ask whether there 's an extra fee for it . Q How is a pediatric dentist different from a family-practice dentist ? A Pediatric dentists receive additional training in caring for children 's oral health . And they tend to make their offices child-friendly by offering videos , special chairs , or music . The caveat : Since pediatric dentistry is a specialty , there may be fewer practitioners to pick from in your area . Ultimately , though , sizing up any prospective dentist comes down to this : How does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does she listen to your concerns ?
