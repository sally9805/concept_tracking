Seven <p> " Lose the weight , or the wedding is off . " <p> What the hell did he just say to me ? The air in my lungs caught in my throat , struggling to escape . Where did his unwarranted demand come from ? His words echoed like ping-pong balls , slamming against my temples fast and furious . I took a deep breath , restraining from screaming in his face . Forget that . Why should I be the sensible one ? <p> " You did n't say that last night , when I was sucking your dick ! " <p> Casually , he said , " Timing would 've been off . Agree ? " <p> I was in shock , a quiescent mime unable to respond . <p> Ping-pong ! Round after round . Somebody please stop the ricochets ! <p> Sitting in silence , I prayed , Give me a sign that this is an April Fool 's joke in the middle of October . Someone please drop a coin in the invisible metal bucket perched at my feet , triggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love you just the way you are . " Motionless , breath trapped inside my throat , I waited and waited and waited . He did n't speak a word . <p> Mama used to tell me , " Do n't be an angry woman . Be a thinking woman . If you feel pressured , silence yourself , take a few deep breaths , and think about what is best for you . " <p> As silence filled the air , we emotionally drifted apart . <p> Swallowing the despair clawing at me , I mustered myself and said , " I ca n't breathe . " Claustrophobia overwhelmed me , causing me to lose my composure and slump into the sofa beside my callous fiancT . <p> All I 'd done since he 'd proposed was joyfully plan our perfect wedding . Two years living together , the last year engaged , and this was his way of calling off the wedding ? Sweat seeped between and underneath my thighs , soaking my black Chicago Bears panties . I 'd understand his behavior if we 'd argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I loved this man with all my heart , my being , my soul . But that 's my fault , not his . <p> " Who ? " I dreaded asking what I had to know . " Is she prettier ? Smaller ? Smarter ? Is she better than me in bed ? I can please you more . Do some other things if you 'd like . Anything . I 'll do anything to make this ... work . " The words strangled me with desperation . Fear of losing the man I loved to another woman consumed me . " Who is she ? Please tell me . " <p> No woman was a bigger freak than me . My big , delicious caramel titties with bubble-gum-sized nipples had easily sandwiched many dicks when I was in high school and in college . I 'd done things to make grown men cry like babies . A few women , too . I could prove it to him . Right here . Right now . I called myself being safe . Careful not to scare him away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind on our honeymoon in St. Barts . <p> He remained stoic , gazing out of the living-room window , beyond Highway 41 , to the blue waters of Lake Michigan . Flatly , Maverick said , " There is no she . All you need to know is you mean the world to me . " <p> I scratched the brow above my twitching left eye . Maverick had n't witnessed the best or worst of what I could offer him . Think , Seven . Think . " You ca n't be serious , " I said faintly , lightly strumming my numb jaw . " Something or someone changed you overnight . You do n't love me like you used to . Last night , the sex , my updating you on our wedding plans , then our watching the presidential debate , I had no idea . No clue you felt this way . What 's wrong with my body ? " <p> I sat up straight , rubbed my stomach , swallowed air while forcing back tears . I nervously tugged a fistful of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body . You 've never complained before . There has to be someone else . Is she younger ? Older ? Or are you tripping off of your father again ? He 's dead , honey . Stop letting him ruin your life from his grave . " <p> His parents and mine were deceased . I could n't imagine any parent being as cruel as Maverick said his dad was to him . We were both only children . I had one best friend , Zena , and he had two close friends from high school . At times Maverick acted more like a child than a grown man . Nothing was ever his fault . I had to think my way out of what was bothering him . <p> Last night , Obama made me believe change was good and that all things were possible . McCain made me fear four more years of a Republican administration , declining property values , vanishing stocks , bank failures , homes foreclosing , more major companies and small businesses filing for bankruptcy , and diminishing 401Ks forcing retirees back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'd slept in the same bed for two years with a complete stranger . While the economy was unpredictable , my relationship was supposed to be recession-proof . So I 'd thought . Foolish me . I was n't giving up on him . <p> " Ouch . " I touched my bottom lip , glanced at my finger , and rubbed the speck of blood on my white Devin Hester jersey . Disappointment layered my sadness with disgust . The slits of my lids narrowed , shrinking his six-foot frame to the three inches he made me feel . Scooting to the opposite end of the apricot-tinted Italian leather sofa , I stared at my fiancT . My palms ached to slap him upside his shiny bald head . <p> His rejection overwhelmed me . For the first time in my life , I felt fat . Miserable . Dirty . Sticky . <p> Do n't slap his selfish ass . Calm down . You are not a violent person . You 're just upset . Maybe this is some sort of last-minute pass or fail test from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to marry a woman who is violent or vindictive . <p> Finally , he answered , " I 'm dead serious . " He pulled from his pocket a pair of my yellow Lycra boy-cut underwear with SWEETER THAN HONEY embroidered in gold across the pubic area . <p> Sideswiped by premeditated premarital sabotage , I tried my best not to look at him . I might go off . <p> Why 'd he have to pick the yellow ones ? Any other color would 've appeared smaller . Black . Red . Snatching the drawers from him , I threw them in his beautiful brown-sugar face , then watched them fall to his lap . A well-trimmed shadow beard trailed a thin line from his ears to his chin , framing his succulent lips with a perfectly aligned goatee , a replica of G. Garvin 's . I should n't have prepared so many of Gerry 's mouthwatering recipes . Too late to regurgitate any of the carbs from my hips . Fat cells had already doubled , tripled , inviting cellulite to the sides and backs of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A bottle of tequila would help me through a liposuction procedure , a few hCG injections , laser cellulite treatments , and a series of body wraps . A quick fix might salvage our relationship or keep me from ... <p> Quietly I stood , went upstairs to his library , removed the shoe box from the top shelf . I held Maverick 's prized possession in my hand . Cold , heavy like my heart . I placed the gun in my laptop bag , closed and locked the safe , then returned to the living room . Here I was , not married yet , already fighting to hang on to my man . I sat beside him . He was not leaving me . Not alive . <p> I hate you ... Kiss me . Hold me . Please tell me you 're not serious . I love you so much . It hurts . <p> Magnificent crystal gray eyes , dilated black coal pupils sparkled like carbonado diamonds . Maverick was perfection personified . A self-made multimillionaire . The wealthiest , most eligible bachelor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me more than any of those housewives of Atlanta and Orange County had combined . <p> " That 's cool , " he said , twirling my drawers on one finger . " But getting upset is n't going to help your case . I spent a half mil on an engagement ring , which is in the jewelry box because it does n't fit ! " Calmly , he continued , " That means the wedding band wo n't fit , either . You need to get real about your fat ass or get up out of my house . It 's just that simple . " <p> Ooh wee , Seven , do n't go back upstairs for the gun . Tears streamed down my cheeks . Breathing heavily , I thought , Mama , what should I say to this man ? <p> " I 'm not a damn Barbie doll ! I 'm a woman . I have feelings . For God 's sake , ca n't you see how much I love you ? " I did n't know what to do or say next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maverick replied , " True . Barbie is white , " adding no comment about his love for me . <p> I sat there on the verge of a nervous breakdown . This man was my everything . My friend . My lover . My fiancT . I had to marry him . <p> Chapter Two Maverick <p> Had a lotta shit on my dick . <p> Seven did n't know me . No one knew the real Maverick Maxamillion . I was a motherless child , knew I wanted to be loved , and was not so sure I was capable of loving . I was money hungry , and money masked my insecurities and promiscuity . I was certain that Seven loved me , and I loved Seven the best I knew how . How could I keep a secret from her ? <p> Best to let her go now , spare her the shock of discovering what I 'd taken from her without her permission . The choice to decide if she wanted to marry a bisexual man . Shit was complicated . My reputation was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father another reason to disown me . My business partners would force me out . Clearly , I needed Seven more than she needed me . <p> Seven sat there , searching my eyes for answers I 'd never share . She was so damn gorgeous . Large , brown , dreamy eyes . Thick , full , pouting lips , which men craved to have on their dicks . Flawless skin , softer than a baby 's . Long , silky jet-black hair , which nicely framed her grapefruit-sized natural breasts . Sexy , shapely legs . She 'd put on more weight than I desired . Would n't hurt her to get it off before the wedding , but her weight gain was n't the reason I had to have space . <p> " Think about how we can work this out . I 've got to go to my office for a few hours , " I lied , then said , " We can finish this discussion when I get back . " I stood , kissed her on the cheek . I looked over my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped crying . <p> I retrieved my cell phone off the coffee table , got on the elevator , strolled past the doorman at the front desk , walked outside , then strode to my town car . <p> " You sure you want to go there ? " DantT asked , holding my door open . <p> " Yeah , I 'm sure , man . Drive , " I said , closing my eyes before he 'd shut my door . Leaning my neck against the leather headrest , I felt tears escape as I visualized Seven crying . <p> In many ways , I was perfect and fucked up . Parental rejection had ruined my childhood . Truth was , I wished my father were dead . Better to lie to Seven about my parents than to have her deal with the bullshit I 'd been confronted with all my life-death threats , rejection . <p> " I hate that motherfucker , " I said , struggling to suppress my sniffles . Hated him for emotionally breaking me down . <p> Stomp ! The sole of my leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adjusting my black slacks , I spread my thighs , held my dick . <p> " Do n't know why you put yourself through this every week , " DantT said from the driver 's seat . His deep voice excited me . " Just whup your old man 's ass , get your mother out of his house , and let her live with us . " <p> I was n't going to argue with him . I 'd told him the house I was building based on Seven 's architectural plans was for Seven , not for him . Initially I 'd asked Seven to leave so I could keep our new home , the home she 'd fantasized about , a surprise . I was tired of DantT 's insecure ass being in competition with my fiancTe . <p> My immediate concern was my mom . I had to find a way to free her . She was miserable , but refused to leave my trifling father . They 'd probably die together . The same way Jesse Jackson had offered no genuine apology to Obama for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Right or wrong , I would not apologize to my dad for disrespecting him . <p> The closer DantT got to my parents ' home on the South Side of Chicago , the slower he drove . We bypassed Soldier Field , where I 'd be Monday night watching the game from my owner 's suite . A few days after that , I 'd be at the United Center , in the suite I owned . <p> DantT parked in front of my father 's house . The lawns adjacent to his one-story , three-bedroom , two-bath , two-thousand-square-foot home had grass up to my knees , with FOR SALE signs on them . I should purchase both homes so no one would hear him scream when I beat his ass to death . <p> I walked up five wide cement steps to the front door , glanced over my shoulder , saw DantT sitting with his car door open , feet planted on the sidewalk , watching my back . <p> Knock . Knock . Knock . The side of my fist banged on the screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shirt wrinkled . Hair woolly . Halitosis slapped me in the nose . <p> Stepping back , I said , " I came to see my mother . " <p> " Where 's your damn respect , boy ? " he grumbled , coughing through the screen . " You ai n't stepping foot in my house until you learn to respect me . " <p> " You sorry-ass motherfucker ! " I shouted , then spat in his face . " That 's my mother . " <p> " Got it twisted . She was my woman before you came along , " he said , wiping my spit from his eyes . " Wait right there . I got your mother-fucker for you . " He disappeared into the house . <p> Peeping into the living room , I saw my mom rocking in her favorite chair . When my dad came into view , she jumped from the cherrywood rocker , grabbed his arms , and screamed , " Leave my baby alone ! No , Frank , do n't kill him ! " <p> " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother to the floor . <p> Pow ! <p> A bullet ripped through the screen , barely missing my shoulder . <p> Seconds later , DantT was on the porch , dragging me away , when pow , another bullet darted between our faces . <p> Jabbing my fists in the air toward him , I yelled , " You 're not the only one with a gun . Be a real man . Put the gun down . Confront me to my face . This ai n't over . I 'll be back for your sorry ass . " DantT dragged me down the steps , forced me into the back of the car , slammed my door , then sped off . <p> " You got a death wish ? You 're not going to be satisfied until he kills you . This is our last time coming over here , " DantT commanded . <p> DantT made me realize that by showing up at Frank 's doorstep every week , I was more afraid to live than to die . <p> Chapter Three Seven <p> You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is through his stomach . " What was that all about ? I thought Maverick was happy with my cooking . Was I not supposed to eat the food I 'd cooked for him ? During our twelve-month engagement , I 'd admittedly gained a few pounds . Hips fuller . Waist thicker . Face slightly rounder . I honestly loved my man so much , I 'd do anything to please him . I stood over the stove to prepare his breakfast and dinner seven days a week and served him lunch when we were home lounging on the weekends . <p> For the first time in our two years together , I slept alone last night , not knowing where Maverick was . Worrying if he was safe . He had n't answered or returned my phone calls . Came in this morning , five o'clock , no conversation , then crashed with his clothes on . I 'd given him three hours to rest . <p> " Maverick , why ? Why bring this up eight weeks before the wedding ? " I said , nudging him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the bed , staring at him . " You could 've said something two , four , six , eight , even ten months ago if you did n't want me gaining weight . " <p> Eyelids closed , eyebrows raised , he mumbled , " Are you serious ? I should n't have had to say anything at all . You do n't have to work . You 're home all day or out shopping with Zena . Zena has n't gained weight . You 're the one who chose not to exercise . You 're not a kid . You 're an adult . Common sense should 've made you realize your ass was spreading . I should n't have to tell you what to do . " <p> " Oh , you mean like when you told me , I do n't want my wife working . Stay home . Seven , stop hanging out late at night with Zena . She 's a single woman . Find some married friends . Stop going to happy hour with your college friends , because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icon in Chicago . I will not have my wife-to-be giving me a bad reputation by being seen with the wrong kind . ' You mean you should n't have told me what to do the day after you proposed ? " I waited for his answer to that . <p> Rolling over twice , then getting out on the opposite side of the bed , he said , " That was pathetic . I do n't care what you do with your life , but do n't change the subject . You ca n't even fit into the fifty-thousand-dollar wedding dress I bought you . I 'm not wasting money on another one . Nor am I altering the one you have . That 's final , sweetheart . I hope , for your sake , whatever you decide to do works for me . I can arrange for you to go to a weight-loss camp for the next six weeks , " he said , heading to the bathroom . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
