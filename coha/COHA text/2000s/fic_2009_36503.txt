Our father told it that Jim was caught dressing up in my grandmother 's black Mikimotos when he was scarcely two years old , but the first time I considered jewelry was the morning I stole my mother 's wedding ring . It was white gold . A hundred-year-old Art Nouveau band with eleven diamonds in two rows across the finger , garnets that were sold as rubies in the centers of tiny roses on both sides , and hand-engraved scrollwork on the underside where it held the skin . It was the only precious thing she had left . It was never from her hand . But there it was on the sill of the window , above the kitchen sink , next to a yellow and green plant she kept . <p> I needed the money . My girlfriend was leaving me for a grocery store produce clerk named Andrew , a high school basketball forward , and I knew I could buy her back . So I took the ring and put it in my pocket . I removed the red rubber stopper from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed into our plumbing . For good measure I ran the water to wash it down . She might be in the other room listening . <p> There was a pawnshop I trusted on Seventeenth Avenue , two blocks from my high school . Woody 's Cash Canada . It had a banner in the front window that read we BUY BROKEN GOLD . It was on the first floor of a three-story building with a barbershop on the second floor and a pool hall on top . We were told never to go into that pool hall . Of course , I should have gone to a pawnshop farther from home but I had not yet learned to reflect in that way . The barbershop was on the second floor and there were stacks of Cheri , Fox , Club Confidential , and other shiny porno magazines on the wooden side tables next to the chairs where you waited . Some men fingered them while they were having their hair cut . When my brother and I were kids I was afraid to look at those magazines , then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be uninterested . <p> Woody 's was the authentic variety of pawnshop , the sort I would come to love : three full jewelry cases with real bargains on minor-brand Swiss watches , early twentieth-century American fourteen- and sixteen-karat rose and copper gold watch heads , Art Deco Hamiltons and Gruens , and odd antique pieces-this was the kind of place where you might even find a natural pearl or an unrecognized tsavorite garnet or a piece of really good old orange citrine-mixed in among crap like gold nugget bracelets and blue topaz pendants and amethyst rings . <p> " I know it 's not much . It 's an old ring , I guess . " <p> " It 's not so bad . Let 's see what it weighs . Is that platinum ? Or just white gold ? " <p> " I do n't know . What 's platinum ? " <p> That was not a question for the seller to ask . <p> " I know those are diamonds , though . Those must be worth something . " <p> " Take a look under the loupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's called carbon . That 's what it is , too . Carbon molecules that never crystallized . Imperfections . Really hurts the value . Lots of inclusions , too . Internal flaws . But at least no cracks . That 's something . I could n't touch it if there were cracks . Too risky . " <p> He knew his business . Did n't steam it , did n't clean it at all . We were looking at sixty years ' worth of dirt , hair , and skin . <p> He gave me three hundred dollars for the ring , which was about correct . Given his position . <p> " I hate to sell it . I inherited it , you know . My grandmother . " <p> " I can loan against this , " he said . " This is a loan , no problem . Normally I will do better for a loan . But on this I advise you sell it outright . " <p> Then I wished I had said it was a friend 's . In case he called my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . " <p> " Love is a good reason . The best reason . Think about it . That 's why your grandmother left it to you . She did n't think you were going to wear it , did she ? No . It was for a girl . If you need to sell it for the girl , that 's what she would have wanted . Women understand these things . What matters and what does n't . You should hear all the love stories they tell me in this place . A pawnshop is the place to learn about love . " <p> He took the ring into the back . <p> " Your grandmother had good taste in jewelry , " he said , after he returned and paid me . " That wo n't be here long . " <p> Good , I thought . <p> Today that ring would retail for seventeen , eighteen thousand , but at that time I imagine it brought three grand . <p> John Strickland , who ran Woody 's , was an old guy and not a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including a heavy walnut box holding sterling flatware I had found in the bureau of an actual friend 's home . In fact it was not the friend 's home but a friend was babysitting there and a few of us got together to steal drinks from their liquor cabinet and watch a video . While the popcorn was popping I wandered into the dining room and found the silver . My friend Tina , the babysitter , came around the corner and caught me . But I had not moved it . I had only opened a drawer . So she could not say anything . She raised her eyebrows at me and said , " Bobby , what are you doing ? " I explained that I was looking for a bowl for the popcorn . Before we left , after several drinks , while she was kissing the other friend of mine in a corner , I returned there and hurried out with the heavy box full of silver in my arms . I lost two friends that way . But I was n't ready to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have spared all three of us the harm , if they had tried . <p> Often , at night , when I was twelve , thirteen , fourteen , and it was winter and the snow was falling , I would leave our neighborhood and climb the hill up into Mount Royal , to walk through their streets and look into the illuminated windows of the houses . You know what that 's like : when it is very cold and motionless , because the snow is coming straight down , it hangs in circles in the streetlights , and inside the houses there is calm or happy movement , as though people are eating and laughing , and their lamps by their windows are like gold and jewels . I would listen to the snow under my tennis shoes , and fold my arms deeper into my coat . These houses were enormous : three , four , five times the size of ours , with larger and faster cars , yards like fields , and they were made of stone and brick , but nevertheless they seemed welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily enough . My father had grown up in a house like one of these . My mother , though , was raised in an apartment . <p> When we were down in Florida at Christmas my father would tell me , " You can have a poverty-consciousness , son , like your mother , or you can have a wealth-consciousness . It 's up to you . Some people are bound to be poor . Your mother and that idiot she married . They ca n't help it . " That was a reason for those walks . To work on my wealth-consciousness . <p> Even with many seasons of practice I have never been adept at stealing and when they kicked me out of high school it was stealing that did it . A case of class rings for the graduating seniors . When I got them to the pawnshop-after my mother 's ring I was using a different one , a dark-cornered place by the Alberta Liquor Store on the south edge of downtown , where you always stumbled over a couple of drunk Indians on the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be base metal mock-ups . Brass and iron lightly electroplated in ten-karat gold and sterling silver . <p> The principal Mr. Robinson and the high school security guard had been after me for three semesters , so it was an excuse for them to play detective . <p> " But they are n't even worth anything , " I said . " You can not expel me because of some fake rings . " <p> " You do n't belong here , Robert , " Mr. Robinson said . " This place is for good people . You are not a good person . You are a thief , a liar , and a coward . " <p> That made us quiet for a moment . Across his desk we sniffed one another . I suspect we both knew I smelled better than he did . <p> I sat outside on a curb in the parking lot and read Siddhartha . I kept that book in my backpack for occasions like this . Sometimes I would switch it out with Jonathan Livingston Seagull , or On the Road , or Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journey to the End of the Night . These were all favorites of mine I had read many times . <p> When I called my big brother Jim to tell him about my expulsion he tried to sell me on the jewelry store . I should have known that as soon as the pitch started Jim believed the lies he was throwing me . It 's like being an actor or prime minister , you get all worked up with the audience and you think you can say nothing false or unbelievable . <p> " It is not your fault , " he said . " The same thing happened to me , more or less , it was just drugs instead of thievery . Head south . The U.S. is where all of us should be , Bobby . That 's what I 'm saying . Move down here with me . I 'll pay for the ticket and you pick it up at the counter at the airport . Dad knew what he was doing when he moved to the States . You and me lead the next charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand a week down here . That 's twenty thousand dollars a month . Plus the company car . A Porsche ! Next year I get the convertible . You would live rent-free . I am practically a gemologist now . You can take the classes , too . Live with us . That 's college ! You do it in the mail . You could be a gemologist in a year . You wo n't believe what those guys make . The real GIA gemologists . That 's the Gemological Institute of America . That 's a whole lot better than university , Bobby . Paychecks . Not to mention the prestige . " <p> " I do n't really want to go to university , anyway , " I said . " I hate school . " <p> " Me , too . I always hated school . That 's natural . " <p> " What about my girlfriend ? " <p> " Of course you 'll meet girls ! You 'll meet a thousand of them . That 's what Mr. Popper hires if he can . Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coeds ! You know what they 're like . And customers . Girls love jewelry , Bobby . That 's most of the market . And women , of course . But lots of girls . You should see the girls ! Everybody knows about the girls in Texas . They are the best girls in the whole country . These do not look like Canadian girls . You would n't think they were the same kind of animal . And they are all over Canadian guys . They love the foreign accent . " <p> " What I was saying was I met a girl up here . A girl in one of my classes . I guess she 's my girlfriend . " <p> " That 's great ! I say give it a try . You can have ten girlfriends . Plus you can always go back . Make some real money and fly her down for Christmas . Think of the presents you can buy her . That 's another thing . You can buy any jewelry you want . For employees it 's all twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is until you 're on the inside . You can buy jewelry for nothing ! I had no idea . It 's triple key , quadruple key , five times . That 's industry language . Triple key means you sell it for three times what it costs . You 'll learn all that when you get here . It 's called Fort Worth Deluxe Diamond Exchange . Like a stock exchange . Only better , because anyone can buy . Anyone can walk off the street and get something for their money . And jewelry goes up in value ! It 's an investment ! That 's what I am telling you . I am not trying to talk you into anything . You have to make your own mistakes . " <p> Jim hung up . I called Wendy . I wanted to speak to her while I was enthusiastic . <p> " Why do n't I come over ? " I said . " What are you doing ? " <p> " I have too much homework , " she said . " I have chemistry homework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do it before class starts . I 'll sneak into the library and help you with it . I 'll meet you in the parking lot . I can do it there if you want . I know that stuff . " <p> " I 'm not learning it that way . We ca n't do it like that anymore . Anyway , I have to get off the phone . I ca n't see you tonight . I am supposed to go to the grocery store with my mom . " <p> " The grocery store ? " <p> " I said I would . I said I would go with her . " <p> " I could come over afterward . " <p> I knew about the grocery store . He went to high school by Wendy 's house . It was the high school she was supposed to go to before we met . Then she decided to go to my high school , which also had the honors program she wanted to be in , which was the reason she went there , and not falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Western it was on account of me that she had come to this lousy school . Now I was kicked out and she was hanging around the high school by her house . She even went to their basketball games . She was going to the grocery store with her mom to see Andrew in the produce department . She imagined herself spinning on his cock in the iceberg lettuce bin . He might stick a cold cucumber up her ass . I remembered that when I was in third grade Jason DeBoer had said that to me , " You walk like you 've got a cucumber stuck up your ass . " I understood the remark . <p> Wendy was not a virgin but she preferred anal sex . She said it was because she could not take chances . As a matter of method she lied to herself first before lying to other people . Or she would lie with a truthful statement like , " I ca n't get pregnant if you come in my ass . " That was a fact but concealed her genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go see grocery boy . I 'll just see you tomorrow . " <p> " No , that 's not what I 'm saying . What I 'm saying is maybe you should n't come over anymore . " <p> " You said you were going to the grocery store with your mom . " <p> " I said I was but I wo n't . Fine . I 'm staying home . I do n't care . That is n't the issue . You are not listening to me . " <p> " Is your mom mad at me ? " <p> " My mom is not the problem , Bobby . Okay . I did n't want to say this . But you are giving me no choice . You made me say it . We should n't see each other anywhere . At all . And do n't say what I know you are going to say . It 's not about anyone else . It 's about us . " <p> I listened to the telephone . I reassured myself that she did not understand the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even hear them . <p> " Us and Andrew , you mean , " I said . I hated to remind her of his name . But I wanted to hear her deny it . <p> " You 're not even in high school anymore , Bobby . I mean , what are you doing with yourself ? What are you going to do ? Just be a dropout ? Sleep in the mall every day ? " <p> To keep my mother in the dark , in the morning when I was going to school I would just take the bus down to the zoo or to the mall . I did not really sleep there . Wendy said that because I had fallen asleep in the food court once and been kicked out by a security guard . I only started going to the mall in the first place because Wendy liked the Caesar salads from the Copper Creperie and I would bring them to her for lunch . I had to sneak in and out of my own high school , because Mr. Robinson had his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main hallway and out the front doors only a few days before . I later told people that the reason I was expelled was that he had caught me in the hallway by one shoulder and I turned around and clocked him one , right in the nose , and he keeled over like a cut tree . Flat on his back , right there by the cafeteria doors . My old man had been a boxer and he had taught me how to throw a right cross and a few combinations , I explained . That part was true . <p> " Maybe I should leave , " I said . Let 's see what she says about that , I thought . <p> " Where are you going to go ? When ? Are you going to live with your brother ? That 's a good idea . " <p> This was not the response I had expected . I did not even know how she might have guessed about that . <p> " I thought you loved me , " I said . That did not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you love me ? " <p> " I would only want you to go to Texas because I love you . Because you need a change . I would n't want you to go for any other reason . " <p> " You want me to go ? Because I will go if you really want me to go . But I do n't think that 's what you honestly want . I think if you ask yourself honestly you will know that 's not what you want . " <p> " What I 'm saying is I know it 's for your own good . Even though I do n't want you to go . You could go and then you could come back . That 's what I 'm saying . " <p> " If you say you do n't want me to go then I wo n't go . " <p> I did not understand how it had happened that now I was going . Before this conversation had begun I knew I could never move down to Texas . What was I going to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important that you go . That is what I am trying to say . I will miss you but sometimes it is good to miss a person . Then when you come back things will be different . Better . " <p> There was silence on my end . I wondered if she was in her bedroom , alone , or if she was in the kitchen with her mother listening . <p> " Is your mother there ? Is your mother making you say that ? " <p> Wendy 's mother had liked me for the first several months . It was not difficult to arrange . I flattered her , dressed cleanly , and smiled often . " You have such nice teeth , Bobby , " she told me . " I just ca n't believe you never had braces . " But then , a month or two before this conversation , she had found some pornographic letters I had written Wendy-it was n't my idea , she insisted on them , it was a job I had to do in order to have regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found the letters , which in itself might not have been disastrous , but one of the letters was about a **25;85;TOOLONG thing , and since then she could not tolerate me . <p> " No . I am in my bedroom . You need to go . It will be good for us , " she said . She made that yawning noise she always made when she was lying . <p> " You are yawning , " I said . <p> " I am yawning because I am tired , " she said . <p> " No , you are yawning because you really do n't want me to go , " I said . " Because you are lying when you say you want me to go . " <p> She yawned again . <p> " You are right . I do n't want you to go . But I think it is really important that you go . " <p> " I 'm going , " I said . " To go , I mean . " Now I had her where I wanted her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad it 's decided . I 'm proud of you . But now I have to go . I have to go to the grocery store with my mother . " <p> " What ? You are doing what ? " <p> " I slipped when I said that , " she said . " I did n't mean to say that last part . I am staying home . " <p> " Stay on the phone , then , " I said . <p> " I have to go , Bobby . I have to do my homework . I am turning off my phone so I can do my homework . Otherwise you 'll never hang up the phone . You 'll just keep calling back and you wo n't let me work . I love you but I have to get off the phone now . " <p> " I love you , too , " I said . " I 'm sorry , " I said . But I knew she had hung up as soon as she told me she loved me . She always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred it . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
