" Hello , I 'm Angie . " " Hey , Angie , " a group of women said robotically , and in unison . " I 've been sleeping with married men for almost five years now , and it 's getting old . I 'm tired of it . I do n't know if it 's because I 'm three days away from being thirty or if this last man I dealt with brought me to this turning point . His name was Jason . He had just got hired at my firm . He was very attractive , young , and ambitious . He definitely had his shit together . I noticed him and his wedding band all in one glance . But a wedding ring never stopped me in the past , and it was n't going to stop me now . So I approached him . Nothing too blunt . I just introduced myself , welcomed him to the office , and made casual conversation . He was polite too , pretending to be enthused at my befriending him . But I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and nothing else . He was faithful . I gave him a couple of days , but he would n't budge . It was as if I did n't exist to him . A hi and good-bye was all he 'd give me . At first I felt a little insulted that he did n't flirt back . But then it started to excite me . It became a game that I was determined to win . I had to break him , especially since he seemed unbreakable . I figured I would have to wait it out and get him at a vulnerable point . It was obvious to me that he and his wife were at a very happy state , probably even newlyweds . I mean , if he was over five years in , with a couple of school-age kids , he would have surely accepted my advances . But he was in love , and it was fresh . So I had to give him time . Four months went by , and one day Mr. Right came into work late  --  for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not focused at all . He told everybody he was n't feeling well . But I knew different . He was having woman problems and I was right there to solve them . I walked down the hall to his office . I knocked on his door . When he did n't answer , I let myself in . There was Mr. Right with his head down on his desk , sleeping like he had n't all night . " I whispered in his ear , ' Wake up , Jason , it 's time for work . ' " " He must have thought I was his wife because he jumped up pleading his case . " ' I 'm sorry , baby , ' he blurted out , with both pain and sincerity in his eyes . " I remember thinking , Damn this man loved the hell out of his woman . I chuckled at his embarrassment when he realized it was just me , Angela , some lady who works at the same firm as he . " ' Excuse me for intruding , ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . ' " I handed him a cup of coffee . He hesitated for a second , and then he took the cup , looked me in my eyes , and thanked me . " I sat down in the chair opposite his desk . " ' So , tell me , ' I began . ' What are you sorry for ? ' " He blushed and sipped the coffee . ' Oh , it 's nothing , ' he said nonchalantly . " I smiled and said , ' Oh , it 's something . It may just be nothing you want to tell me . ' " There was a brief silence . " ' Oh , what the hell , ' he said . ' I could use a woman 's perspective anyway . ' I finally broke the man , " I told the group of women whose eyes were glued on me . " He then began to explain to me what happened . " ' I ran into my ex-fiancee on my way home from work yesterday . She was waiting for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just a little plastic bag to keep her hair dry . Of course I felt bad for her , and so I offered to take her home . I made one quick stop at the cleaners , and when I got back in my car , my ex-fiancee told me that I was going to get in trouble . So I was like , What are you talking about ? What makes you think that ? She told me that while I was in the cleaners picking up my clothes , my wife 's sister pulled up beside my car . Apparently , she cursed my ex-fiancee out and told her that she was going to tell her sister . So I get home , and my wife is all down my throat talking about , why did you have your ex-fiancee in your car , and if you were just being nice and taking her home , why the hell were you around the corner from our house when she lives on the other side of the city ! ' " ' So why did you have her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were just taking her home ? I mean , why did n't you just take her home first ? ' I asked him . " ' I wanted to catch the cleaners before they closed , ' Jason whined to me . " ' Okay , that makes sense . Did you explain that to her ? ' I asked . " ' Yeah , but convincing her that it 's the truth was the hard part , ' he said . " This is when I decided to go in for the kill . " ' Why does n't your wife trust you ? ' I asked . " Just like a fool in love , he rushed to his wife 's defense . ' She does trust me . ' " ' Not just you , Jason , a good woman should trust your judgments as well . ' " He sat quietly for a second , going over in his head what I had said . He sipped his coffee and set the cup down on his desk . He leaned back in his chair and contemplated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know so much about being a good woman , why are n't you married ? ' " ' Because I also know so much about being a bad man , ' I replied with a seductive grin . " The conversation took off from there , and before long I was meeting Mr. Right in the parking lot after hours . Now , I was used to sleeping with married men , so I felt no type of way about it . But when he told me we could n't see each other anymore because his wife had miscarried stressing over me  --  the other woman  --  I felt guilty . And it was a type of guilt  --  " " YOU BITCH ! " one of the women cut me off as she leaped toward me in rage . I tried to get out of my chair and run , but it all happened so fast , I found myself paralyzed . The woman knocked my chair over with me still sitting in it . She hunched over me , her knees pressed against my chest . Her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , struggling to move , when the woman pulled a blade from her pocket and slit my throat . I could n't feel my own pain , but I definitely felt hers . She was Jason 's wife . Beep ! Beep ! Beep ! Angela jumped up out of her sleep , grabbed her butcher knife from beneath her pillow with one hand , and banged her alarm clock to death with the other . She was breathing heavily , and in a panic she began rubbing her neck checking for a cut . Looking around the room , she realized she had been dreaming . She put the knife back in its place and took a sip of the water that sat on the nightstand beside her bed . She looked at the clock . It was nine thirty . Today was the day . She drank the last of the water , got out of bed and into some sweatpants , then took her daily four-mile jog around her apartment complex . When she got back in , she showered , ate some breakfast , and waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call everything off . But she had taken the day off for this , so that was not an option . Angela was anxious . She had planned everything to a T : from what she would wear to every word she would say , even the restaurant where they would meet for lunch . She knew this was her final chance to convince Carlos of their love for each other . If she waited any longer , he would slip through her fingers , especially if he went on that trip with Monica next week . This was her last shot to get him to leave his family and be with her . She was ready . The only thing she was waiting on was the phone call from Carlos . But it never came . " What the hell ? " Angela mumbled to herself as she paced her one-bedroom luxury apartment . " It 's going on three o'clock . " Angela contemplated calling Carlos 's cell phone , despite the fact that he had asked her not to unless he gave her direct instructions to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ago . Her patience was wearing thin . All the possible reasons why he had n't called her yet ran through her head . Did he have an accident ? Is he sick ? Or worse , did his ass back out of our agreement , she thought . She finally broke and picked up the phone to call him . " The number you have dialed has been disconnected at the subscriber 's request . " " That bastard ! " Angela shouted . She was sick and tired of playing games with Carlos . For the whole three years of knowing him , it had been one game of cat and mouse after the other . But this was it , Angela thought . She wanted Carlos badly , and she wanted him to herself . She knew it was n't likely for a married man to leave his wife for another woman . But she thought she was the exception . She was sure she could make Carlos do just that . All she felt she needed was a little more time . " Mm , Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the bed . " It 's been a while since we went at it like that . " " I know , with the kids here all the time , it 's hard , " Carlos explained . " Well , I 'll be sending them to my mother 's more often for a treat like this , " Monica said with excitement . The two giggled and smothered each other 's body with their arms . They rolled around in their moist passion until they fell asleep in each other 's bliss . After a brief nap , Carlos woke up to the smell of cooking food . He turned over and realized his wife was not beside him . Getting out of the bed , he walked downstairs wearing nothing but a pair of boxer shorts . " Hey , honey , " Carlos said as he kissed his wife on the cheek . Monica was standing at the kitchen sink breaking fresh collard greens with her bare hands . " Umm , something smells good , " Carlos said , taking a deep breath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling . " My favorite dish ? I laid it on you then , huh ? " Carlos jokingly suggested as he hugged his wife from behind . " Go get in the shower . You smell like sex , " Monica teased , bypassing Carlos 's comment . Carlos did as he was told . By the time he finished washing up and throwing on some clothes , dinner was done . The pair sat out on their deck to enjoy the delicious meal . They talked and laughed about their relationship over the years , going back as far as college . Carlos and Monica had been married for almost ten years . They first met in college . Carlos was going into his junior year and was giving a tour of the campus one summer , and Monica just happened to be in his group . Monica was going to be a freshman that fall , and of the other female freshmen , she was among the top ten in the looks and style department . She had long jet-black hair that she tied up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly arched eyebrows and accented her almond-shaped eyes . Her golden complexion resembled a perfect tan . All the latest fashions covered her shapely physique , and she was smothered in gold . She was a daddy 's girl and an only child , so she was spoiled rotten . The upperclassmen were likely to be all over her . They liked what they called fresh meat . They figured new girls were naive and vulnerable because they did n't know the guys ' reputations yet , and Carlos was no different . He had taken the tour-guide position in the first place so he would have first dibs . He was a ladies ' man who enjoyed flirting with all the pretty faces , and he particularly liked being able to try his hand with them before all the other guys could . " Maybe later I can give you a tour of the dorms , " Carlos said to Monica , a boyish grin on his face . Monica looked at Carlos like he was crazy , and said , " I 'll pass . " Carlos was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . His six-foot-tall , athletic build ; light , soft skin ; and curly hair usually got him yeses from girls right off the bat . " What 's wrong ? Did I offend you ? " Carlos asked , correctly reading Monica 's attitude . " What would I need a tour of the dorms for ? " Monica responded . Figuring he was n't dealing with a ditsy cute girl , Carlos thought up a quick reply , " ' Cause if you see them , you can know which one to pick . See , they usually assign freshmen randomly , but if you know which dorm you want they 'll let you choose . I 'm tryna hook you up . " Monica blushed , and said , " Oh , " still carrying an attitude . She was so used to guys coming at her , she kept her guard up at all times . " See , you thought I was bein ' nasty . What 's on ya mind ? " Carlos joked . Monica smiled and playfully hit Carlos on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some type of chemistry between the two of them . She knew that the story about showing her the dorms was game , but she respected the fact that he had made something up . Guys like Carlos , who could probably get any girl he looked at , did n't make excuses . They saw somebody they wanted , made their advance , and if that girl was n't with it , they said to hell with her and moved on to the next one . But Carlos was different , at least on that day , and he won her heart . Four years went by , and they found themselves saying " I do , " followed by twin sons five years after that . Carlos and Monica were inseparable . They had the type of relationship that other couples only dreamed of . It was like a fairy tale with an everlasting happy ending . Their sons , Carlos Jr . and Christopher , looked like a perfect blend of the two of them . They both had Carlos 's big cocoa brown eyes and light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thick hair covered their heads and formed their eyebrows . They were an adorable pair of five-year-olds , and all together they were a beautiful family . The sun was now on its way down and the wind blew a comfortable breeze . Monica and Carlos needed that day . Between her teaching preschoolers at a summer program , his teaching workout courses at a university , and all of their spare time devoted to the twins , they had n't spent any quality time together in a while . It had grown dark by the time Monica and Carlos went to pick up their boys from Monica 's mother . As Monica turned the key in her mother 's door , a sense of excitement came over both her and Carlos . This was the first time they had spent the day without their children in a long time . " Daddy 's here , " Carlos sang immediately after entering his mother-in-law 's house . " Dad-dy ! " his sons squealed as they paused the video game they had been playing and ran into their father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her husband hug the boys . After soaking in all the love from his sons , Carlos stepped back and looked them over . " Let me look at you two . Which one of you grew taller since yesterday ? " he asked . " I did ! I did ! " they both shouted , each one trying to be louder than the other . Carlos laughed and rubbed both their heads . " Go give your mother a hug and a kiss , " he said . He then walked over to Monica 's mother , who had been sitting on the sofa observing her daughter 's family with delight . " And for the second most beautiful woman in the world , " Carlos said as he kissed his mother-in-law on her cheek . Carlos was an excellent husband and father . He was charming , respectful , committed , and good-looking . Monica took a minute to count her blessings . The big round clock that hung in Angela 's living room right above her fireplace said two o'clock . Angela was on her couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the previous morning . An infomercial was playing on the TV . She picked up the cordless phone from the floor and checked the caller ID . Nothing . Carlos had n't even bothered to call her . She had expected a call early in the afternoon . Now here it was two o'clock in the morning . She had taken off work for him , she thought . She was furious . She dialed the number for his home office . " Hello , " Carlos whispered , noticing Angela 's name in his caller ID box . " I thought I told you not to call me past a certain time . " Carlos sounded frustrated . Angela 's stomach tied up in knots . She could n't believe Carlos 's tone . " Carlos , we had a deal ! " " I know , I know , but my wife surprised me with a day off together , " Carlos explained . " But you promised ! For years , you 've been promising ! " Angela whined . " I do n't know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tears began to well up in Angela 's eyes . " I 'm talking about us . You and me , Carlos . What 's going to happen to us ? That 's what we were supposed to discuss today , remember ? " " Listen , I have to go , and there is no us . I 'm sorry , " Carlos said , right before he hung up on her . " CARLOS ! CARLOS ! " Angela screamed into the phone . When she realized he had hung up , she threw her phone across the room . She began to experience a piercing pain in her stomach . She paced her apartment until she got tired . Then she balled up in a corner and wrapped her arms tightly around her knees . Her head was burning with a migraine . She was having flashbacks of all the good times she had with Carlos , the many days Carlos was the only person who kept her sane . Then , fragments of scenes from her past relationships passed through her mind : the affair her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce , her pregnancy . She felt her migraine growing stronger . She needed Carlos more now than ever before . He had been the only person who could make all the pain of her past disappear . He had been her backbone , her single reason for living . And here he was telling her it was over . Just like that . No forewarning , no remorse , nothing . Everything she 'd been through with him , everything he 'd done for her were just distant memories . And now he would go on to be happy with his wife and children and leave Angela out on her own with nobody . She could n't handle it . She was devastated . Walking into her bathroom , she opened the medicine cabinet and retrieved a bottle of Vicodin painkillers . She was going to put a stop to this headache . She was going to put a stop to everything .
