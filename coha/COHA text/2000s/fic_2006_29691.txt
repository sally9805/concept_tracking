Chapter One " JUST AS I AM , without one plea . " Willie Nelson 's voice filled the car , and Claire Montoya gawked at the radio as if it had suddenly started speaking in tongues . The man in the farm truck ahead of her slammed on his brakes for one of the three traffic lights in Hamilton Falls , Washington , and Claire whipped her attention back to the road before she ran into him . " Just As I Am " ? What on earth was Willie Nelson , a worldly entertainer , doing singing one of the hymns of the Elect of God ? Had he run across one of their privately printed hymnbooks ? Or was it a sign of something bigger ? Lately KGHM 's programming had changed from farm reports that nobody listened to , to gospel music , call-in shows , bluegrass , and Christian pop . An even bigger change was that everybody in the Elect-well , the young people , anyway-listened to KGHM , even though listening to the radio was technically a sin . It filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small voice of God to be drowned out . Or so said the Shepherds , the itinerant preachers who gave up all natural expectations such as home and family to minister to the souls of men , and who were the final authority on all things natural and spiritual . But how could " Just As I Am " fill the mind with noise when they had sung it just last week in Gathering ? At least Willie Nelson was easier on the ears than Alma Woods , who on a good day sounded like a raven with its tail caught in a gate . During that very hymn last week , a woman had risen to her feet , indicating her willingness to serve God with the Elect , their community of true believers scattered throughout the state . Claire was n't sure how valid the woman 's profession of faith was , though . At the moment , they had no Shepherds to oversee the flock , and a person could n't enter the fold and find salvation without one . She turned into the parking lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling very visible and solitary as she crossed the lot alone , went into the hall alone , and chose a seat halfway up on the right side , where the young people tended to sit together . There were n't as many as there used to be . A year ago she and Julia McNeill , her best friend , would have come in together after having spent the day together or with the gang . But Julia had left and married Outside their fellowship . Unlike someone who had been Silenced , people could still speak to and about her , but they tended not to . What would be the point ? Her soul was lost for all eternity . And besides , she and her husband lived in Seattle . Lucky Julia . Claire could have sat with Dinah Traynell , if she still lived in Hamilton Falls . But Dinah 's mother , Elsie , had sold the home place where people had been going to Gathering for a hundred years or more and had bought a cozy house in Spokane . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had n't taken long for the reason the whole Traynell family had moved away to leak out . That reason-Phinehas , former senior Shepherd of the flock-was currently spewing fire and brimstone in the county lockup at Pitchford while he waited for his trial , which was scheduled to begin tomorrow . Much to everyone 's shock and dismay , their leader had been accused of raping two generations of Traynell women . It had taken all these months for Claire herself to come to the slow acceptance that their leadership had been seriously flawed . She sighed and stared sightlessly at the open Bible in her lap while she waited for the service to begin . Dinah would be back to testify , but it was n't likely she 'd get much of a welcome . She 'd gone Outside , too , and was engaged to be married to her former hired man . They were going to Cornwall for their honeymoon . Claire had never been farther from home than Seattle . Cornwall seemed like a magical place , full of Celtic ruins and brilliant light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's intended , who had spent fifteen minutes on the phone the other night long-distance from California rhapsodizing about all the childhood haunts he was going to show his bride . By the time Dinah got there , she was going to need a good dose of light and flowers . Claire did n't see how her friend was going to get through the next few weeks . Or how she herself was going to manage it . She had n't been deposed yet , but there was no guarantee she would n't be called upon as a character witness . Or so said Investigator Raymond Harper of the Organized Crime Task Force , who was camped out in Hamilton Falls and Pitchford for the duration of the trial . She 'd met him on her last visit to Ross and Julia 's when he 'd dropped in at dinnertime . He was Ross 's partner , and frankly , he made her uncomfortable . Maybe it was his size or maybe it was simply the knowledge of just how ugly human behavior could get that lurked in his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better . Owen Blanchard left his seat and made his way to the microphone at the front of the hall . He was Elder of the church that met in his home-or had met there . After the Traynells ' departure , Sunday Gathering had been moved here to the hall because not everyone could fit in his rec room . Gathering could only be held in the homes of one of the favored families , which was problematic now since there was only one , and Owen could n't be expected to shoulder the burden indefinitely . He had two children and the principalship of the local high school to think about . Face it , Claire thought , the Elect are in total disarray . Julia started it , Dinah finished it , and now we have to pick up the pieces . She hoped Owen had come up with some kind of solution . These stop-gap Gatherings could n't go on forever . She also hoped she could grab a private moment with him after the service . She needed an answer , and the waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they had sung it in tolerable four-part harmony , he led them in prayer . Claire expected testimony time would happen next , when all the men took turns speaking on a verse or confessing struggles or saying what their wives told them to say . But Owen stayed at the microphone until everyone stopped wiggling in their seats and whispering . " You all know what 's going to happen tomorrow , " he said . The overhead lighting glinted on his hair , which had been a vibrant reddish gold until recently , but was now a sandy gray . " Phinehas's-I mean , Mr. Leslie's-jury has been chosen , and his trial is going to begin . It 's up to you folks whether you go or not . Some of us have been deposed to testify . " He sighed , and then went on . " Folks , we have to come to some kind of decision , here . " Mark McNeill , Julia 's father , whom Claire had hardly ever seen speak outside of his duties as former Elder , stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still at the Grotons ' place . He had a nervous breakdown and is completely unfit to lead the flock . The family is on suicide watch . " Melchizedek , the younger Shepherd over the congregation in Hamilton Falls , had practically worshipped the ground Phinehas had walked on . At the news that Phinehas had been sexually abusing the females in the Traynell family for thirty years , he had cracked and gone to his sister 's place in Spokane . The other Shepherds , scattered throughout the state of Washington , were in as bad a condition as the people in Hamilton Falls when they 'd heard the news about their leader . Some believed the accusations ; some did not . Some tried to carry on in their faith ; some had gone Outside and had not been heard from since . " Why is God punishing us ? " Derrick Wilkinson , the man sitting on Claire 's right , wanted to know . " Have our sins been that bad ? " God is n't punishing us , Claire thought . He 's punishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't get to marry into a favored family and become an Elder , let 's not take this personally . It was a well-known fact among the local Elect females that Derrick had pursued first Julia McNeill Malcolm and then Dinah Traynell because they were daughters of the two favored families . Without one of them as his wife , he would never realize his career aspirations to be Deacon and , later , Elder of his own house church . The position was hereditary-and now there was no one left to inherit . Poor Derrick . Maybe he 'd have to move to a new town and find another favored-family girl to date-unless the Shepherds had told him what they 'd told her . " There is a solution , " Owen said . " I 'm putting it to you all tonight in hopes that we can take heart and move on in strength , particularly in view of the days ahead . " " What 's that ? " Derrick asked , speaking for all of them . " I 'd like to introduce a guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Claire glanced at Rebecca Quinn , her landlady , on her left . Other than the Shepherds , who were anointed of God to speak , and the Elder , whose job it was to administer the flock in the Shepherds ' periodic absences , guest speakers were unheard of . Who else could bring the Word of God to his people but the anointed ones ? " Maybe the Shepherd from Richmond has come to help us , " Rebecca whispered . " He 's gone , " Claire whispered back . " My folks got the word this morning . Left without a trace . They think he joined the army . " Claire would have said more , but a man got up from the front row and bounded up to the microphone as if he owned the very earth . Wow . Claire blinked and forgot the rest of what she had been about to say . The man was tall and had the kind of presence that natural leaders possessed . His shoulders were broad and strong , in contrast to a trim waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he turned to face them , she saw that his eyes were brown and long-lashed . He smiled , and a long dimple cut into his cheek . Claire heard a rustle as all the single women in the crowd sat up and took notice , including a few of the widows . " Now , that 's a fine-looking man , " Rebecca murmured . " If he 's a new Shepherd , it wo n't matter , " Claire said . The Shepherds were homeless and celibate , the better to go wherever the gospel led them . Free of natural ties , their lives were consecrated to God 's will . Most of the Elect 's rules about women 's dress , Claire often thought privately , were designed to make it easier for the Shepherds to make this sacrifice . If a man could n't see a woman 's skin , if her hair was pinned up modestly , the Shepherds were less likely to be reminded of what they had lost from a physical standpoint . Theoretically . This , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thirty-year persecution of the Traynell women . " I 'd like to present Mr. Luke Fisher , " Owen said , " evangelist from our very own KGHM radio , right here in Hamilton Falls . " What ? People turned in their seats to stare at one another and gaped at Owen as if they could n't believe their ears . A worldly evangelist ? To speak to them ? Someone who was n't even Elect ? " Is he completely mad ? " Rebecca asked aloud , forgetting to whisper . No one heard her . Everyone was busy talking , speculating , wondering the same thing . " Please , folks , listen to me . " Owen 's voice rose above the noise , and out of habit , the congregation quieted enough that he could be heard . " We 've all been praying without ceasing that God would save us in our hour of need . And I believe the reason He has n't is because we 've strayed away from Him . We 've put our trust in our leadership-in man , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've looked inwardly to ourselves instead of looking outwardly at what God is doing in the world . " People murmured , and Claire nibbled her lower lip , wondering where on earth this was going . " It 's been revealed to me that perhaps God speaks to people outside of the Elect , that maybe we might have something to learn from Mr. Fisher , who has led congregations two and three times this size and who , I 'm convinced , has his heart right with God . " Owen looked around at them all . " I 'm not saying he 's a Shepherd . I 've only invited him to be a guest speaker . Our fundamental beliefs remain the same-but I think it would do the people of God good to embrace the Holy Spirit in others , as well as in themselves . " Mark McNeill , Owen 's father-in-law and a retired Elder , stood and cleared his throat . " Owen , I do n't think that 's right . You know the Holy Spirit is only given to God 's people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gospel spoken by the Shepherds . Only they have the authority . " Owen nodded respectfully . " But at the moment we do n't have a Shepherd . Mr. Fisher is just a guest speaker , Dad . " " You or I could speak in the Shepherds ' place . " Owen began to look uncomfortable at having a disagreement with his father-in-law in public . " I 've had a revelation , " he repeated , " and I believe it was from God . " It was hard to argue with that . Since the downfall of Phinehas , Claire had wondered if the Elect put their leaders on a pedestal , to the point where perhaps they blocked the light that came from God . Some , such as the McNeills , catered to their every whim , bringing out the best china , the best food , making even a bowl of cereal or a cup of coffee an event . Others , including her parents , treated the Shepherds like visiting relatives whenever they came to stay . Hospitality to the Shepherds was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a show of their service in order to impress the leaders . " Folks , " Owen pleaded , " let 's listen to Mr. Fisher 's message and then do what Paul exhorted us to do-try the spirit and see if it 's of God . " He yielded the microphone to Luke Fisher and returned to his seat . Every eye in the hall was riveted to the front . Claire drew in a breath as Luke Fisher began to speak . That melodious voice-which had sounded in her car , announcing songs , exhorting people to come to God , talking with people who called in-filled their humble meeting place with his particular brand of music . " Those of you who listen to the radio , " he said , " may have heard a number of your hymns being played and wondered how it could be that worldly artists could sing the music and words that mean so much to you . " He paused , and all the young people in Claire 's row looked at each other , eyebrows raised . Obviously they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had even been listening to the radio on the way to Mission and had heard " Just As I Am . " " Well , here 's the thing . " He paused , then said , " I grew up in the Elect . " An audible gasp swept through the room . " I did , and when I went Out , I lived a life of sin and suffering , brought on by my own headstrong will . But God had a plan for me , and do you know what that was ? " Claire found herself shaking her head , as though he had spoken directly to her . She wished he would . She wished those eyes would seek her out in the midst of this crowd and see that there was a mature , reasonably attractive woman who was currently single and very much available , right there in the seventh row . " God 's plan was for me to preach the gospel , but not as a Shepherd . No , His plan for my life reaches farther than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a sin , my friends . It 's a way of reaching the hearts of the sick , the shut-in , those who are n't as fortunate as we are in this hall tonight . It 's a way of bringing cheer to your soul as you drive to the supermarket , of focusing your mind on Christ while you work in the office . It 's a way to reach the soul on the other side of the cube divider who does n't know which way to turn in a life that looks like a maze . " ( Continues ... )
