Chapter One PEE-WEE BOXER SURVEYED THE JOBSITE WITH DISGUST . THE FOREMAN was a scumbag . The crew were a bunch of losers . Worst of all , the guy handling the Cat did n't know jack about hydraulic excavators . Maybe it was a union thing ; maybe he was friends with somebody ; either way , he was jerking the machine around like it was his first day at Queens Vo-Tech . Boxer stood there , beefy arms folded , watching as the big bucket bit into the brick rubble of the old tenement block . The bucket flexed , stopped suddenly with a squeal of hydraulics , then started again , swinging this way and that . Christ , where did they get these jokers ? He heard a crunch of footsteps behind him and turned to see the foreman approaching , face caked in dust and sweat . " Boxer ! You buy tickets to this show , or what ? " Boxer flexed the muscles of his massive arms , pretending not to hear . He was the only one on the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Boxer did n't care ; he liked keeping to himself . He heard the excavator rattle as it carved into the solid wall of old fill . The lower strata of older buildings lay open to the sun , exposed like a fresh wound : above , asphalt and cement ; below , brick , rubble , then more brick . And below that , dirt . To sink the footings for the glass apartment tower well into bedrock , they had to go deep . He glanced out beyond the worksite . Beyond , a row of Lower East Side brownstones stood starkly in the brilliant afternoon light . Some had just been renovated . The rest would soon follow . Gentrification . " Yo ! Boxer ! You deaf ? " Boxer flexed again , fantasizing briefly about sinking his fist into the guy 's red face . " Come on , get your ass in gear . This is n't a peepshow . " The foreman jerked his head toward Boxer 's work detail . Not coming any closer , though . So much the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were busy piling bricks into a Dumpster , no doubt for sale to some pioneering yuppie around the corner who liked crappy-looking old bricks at five dollars each . He began walking , just slowly enough to let the foreman know he was n't in any hurry . There was a shout . The grinding of the excavator ceased suddenly . The Cat had bit into a brick foundation wall , exposing a dark , ragged hole behind it . The operator swung down from the idling rig . Frowning , the foreman walked over , and the two men started talking animatedly . " Boxer ! " came the foreman 's voice . " Since you ai n't doing squat , I got another job for you . " Boxer altered his course subtly , as if that was the way he 'd already been going , not looking up to acknowledge he had heard , letting his attitude convey the contempt he felt for the scrawny foreman . He stopped in front of the guy , staring at the man 's dusty little workboots . Small feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Welcome to the world , Pee-Wee . Take a look at this . " Boxer gave the hole the merest glance . " Let 's see your light . " Boxer slipped the ribbed yellow flashlight out of a loop in his pants and handed it to the foreman . The foreman switched it on . " Hey , it works , " he said , shaking his head at the miracle . He leaned into the hole . The guy looked like an idiot , standing daintily on tiptoe atop a fallen pile of brick , his head and torso invisible within the ragged hole . He said something but it was too muffled to make out . He withdrew . " Looks like a tunnel . " He wiped his face , smearing the dust into a long black line . " Whew , stinks in there . " " See King Tut ? " someone asked . Everyone but Boxer laughed . Who the hell was King Tut ? " I sure as shit hope this is n't some kind of archaeological deal . " He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strong fella . I want you to check it out . " Boxer took the flashlight and , without a glance at the weenies around him , hoisted himself up the collapsed pile of bricks and into the hole the excavator had cut into the wall . He knelt atop the broken bricks , shining his light into the cavity . Below was a long , low tunnel . Cracks doglegged up through the walls and across the ceiling . It looked just about ready to collapse . He hesitated . " You going in , or what ? " came the voice of the foreman . He heard another voice , a whiny imitation . " But it 's not in my union contract . " There were guffaws . He went in . Bricks had spilled down in a talus to the floor of the tunnel . Boxer half scrambled , half slid in , raising clouds of dust . He found his feet and stood up , shining the light ahead . It lanced through the dust , not getting far . From inside , the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust and the dust to settle . He heard conversation and laughter from above , but faintly , as if from a great distance . He took a few steps forward , shining the beam back and forth . Threadlike stalactites hung from the ceiling , and a draft of foul-smelling air licked his face . Dead rats , probably . The tunnel appeared to be empty , except for a few pieces of coal . Along both sides were a long series of arched niches , about three feet across and five high , each crudely bricked up . Water glistened on the walls , and he heard a chorus of faint dripping sounds . It seemed very quiet now , the tunnel blocking all noise from the outside world . He took another step , angling the flashlight beam along the walls and ceiling . The network of cracks seemed to grow even more extensive , and pieces of stone jutted from the arched ceiling . Cautiously , he backed up , his eye straying once again to the bricked-up niches along both walls . He approached the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others looked loose . He wondered what might be inside the niches . Another tunnel ? Something deliberately hidden ? He shined the light into the brick-hole , but it could not penetrate the blackness beyond . He put his hand in , grasped the lower brick , and wiggled it . Just as he thought : it , too , was loose . He jerked it out with a shower of lime dust . Then he pulled out another , and another . The foul odor , much stronger now , drifted out to him . He shined the light in again . Another brick wall , maybe three feet back . He angled the light toward the bottom of the arch , peering downward . There was something there , like a dish . Porcelain . He shuffled back a step , his eyes watering in the fetid air . Curiosity struggled with a vague sense of alarm . Something was definitely inside there . It might be old and valuable . Why else would it be bricked up like that ? He remembered a guy who once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rare , worth a couple thousand . Bought himself a slick new Kubota riding mower . If it was valuable , screw them , he was going to pocket it . He plucked at his collar buttons , pulled his T-shirt over his nose , reached into the hole with his flashlight arm , then resolutely ducked his head and shoulders in after it and got a good look . For a moment he remained still , frozen in place . Then his head jerked back involuntarily , slamming against the upper course of bricks . He dropped the light into the hole and staggered away , scraping his forehead this time , lurching back into the dark , his feet backing into bricks . He fell to the floor with an involuntary cry . For a moment , all was silent . The dust swirled upward , and far above there was a feeble glow of light from the outside world . The stench swept over him . With a gasp he staggered to his feet , heading for the light , scrambling up the slide of bricks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and scrabbling with both hands . Suddenly he was out in the clear light , tumbling headfirst down the other side of the brick pile , landing facedown with a stunning blow . He vaguely heard laughter , which ceased as soon as he rolled over . And then there was a rush to his side , hands picking him up , voices talking all at once . " Jesus Christ , what happened to you ? " " He 's hurt , " came a voice . " He 's all bloody . " " Step back , " said another . Boxer tried to catch his breath , tried to control the hammering of his heart . " Do n't move him . Call an ambulance . " " Was it a cave-in ? " The yammering went on and on . He finally coughed and sat up , to a sudden hush . " Bones , " he managed to say . " Bones ? Whaddya mean , bones ? " " He 's not making any sense . " Boxer felt his head begin to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his face . " Skulls , bones . Piled up . Dozens of them . " Then he felt faint and lay down again , in the bright sunlight .
