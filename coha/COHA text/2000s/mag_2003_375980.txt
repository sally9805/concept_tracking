Blackout : Can It Happen Again ? <P> Now that the Northeastern U.S. has suffered the largest power outage in history COVER STORY , Aug. 25 and the economy has lost billions of dollars through idled offices and factories , spoiled food and interrupted travel , maybe President Bush and the Republican congressional leadership would like to tell us how the glorious " free market " is going to prevent further catastrophic blackouts . Maybe Dick Cheney 's ultrasecret energy task force has that information in its notes , which the Vice President adamantly refuses to share with his employers , the American people . STEPHEN KRIZ Maple Grove , Minn . <P> Utilities such as electricity are said to be public services . What a farce ! Utilities that are owned by for-profit corporations have primary legal responsibility to their investors , not the public . When the supplier of electric power has a monopoly in a given area , there is no competition and no incentive to do better , and government regulation is too easily manipulated . Public services should be owned by the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I had to walk nine miles from Manhattan to my home in Brooklyn . So the milk turned sour , and the meat went bad . So I could n't use my computer or watch TV , and I had to sleep outside because there was no air conditioning . But how often do I get to see the stars over New York City ? CHAIM THEIL New York City <P> In the old days , utilities were graded on service and reliability . Americans , welcome to your deregulated , profit-first future . Invest in plant , staff and equipment ? Not anymore . That obsolete approach would reduce the bottom line and  --  oh , yeah  --  executive bonuses . We 'll all just have to learn to do more with less . More candles , water jugs and anxiety . Fewer comfortable homes , less safe food and hope . CHRIS SMITH Minnetonka , Minn . <P> Experts suggest that utility ratepayers could be on the hook for $50 billion or more to upgrade the electric-power grid . Meanwhile , the current annual Federal Government investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . Solar power kept working when the grid went down . What is wrong with this picture ? GLENN HAMER , EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION Washington <P> Taking Teachers from the Poor <P> Joe Klein masterfully laid out the explanation of why the worthwhile Teach for America organization was defunded by the Federal Government 's AmeriCorps program IN THE ARENA , Aug. 25 . Limited resources plague even the richest nation in the world . When we insist on funding items like the F-22 Raptor fighter jet and a missile-defense shield with billions upon billions of dollars , we crowd out money for valuable things like education and social programs . President Eisenhower , a five-star general , warned us to increase our scrutiny of defense spending . Nonetheless , we find ourselves with a $400 billion defense budget . Neither Klein nor the rest of us should look past the Pentagon when seeking the answer to who killed Teach for America . FRANCIS X. STONE Boston
