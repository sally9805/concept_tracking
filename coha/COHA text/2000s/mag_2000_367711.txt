In the recent Supreme Court ruling against a Texas high school 's prayers before football games , Justice John Paul Stevens wrote , " Pregame prayer has the improper effect of coercing those present to participate in an act of religious worship . " The public-school district had argued that attendance at football games was voluntary and " decidedly extracurricular . " Because I played high school football in Texas in the 1980s , one aspect of Justice Stevens ' majority response to this distinction struck home to me . By pointing out that " team members themselves " have to be there , he defended those of us who were simply feverish for football and less so for the Christian prayer we heard on game days . Yet as much as I agree with the high court 's ruling as a matter of principle , my own experience might make an argument for the other side . Rather than feeling an increased " sense of isolation and affront , " as the court warns us those in the religious minority might experience , I sometimes found an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my teammates after taking part in the pregame prayers , a solemn connection that I wanted to scoff at but , because it moved me , could not . <P> Unlike many of the students this ruling is designed to protect , I did n't have strong feelings that were smothered by the prayer in my Texas high school . Until my family moved there from Chicago , my religious experiences , with a Jewish father and an Irish-Catholic mother , were brief and infrequent . For two days every autumn , I accompanied my dad to synagogue while my mom stayed home making matzo-ball soup , brisket and kasha . At services I sometimes crept from the auditorium and found a game room , where I played pinball like an uptight burglar , braced against discovery . I had a Bar Mitzvah and recited the Hebrew words of my service from memory without comprehending them , but my Little League game later that day still sticks in my memory better than my supposed passage into manhood . <P> My Texas high school was a different world . Prayer season lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my peers . Any cause for anxiety  --  tests , games , dates  --  was a chance to was a clear sign of gossip . Here it was a prayer circle , and there were boys in it too , holding hands , heads down , powerfully silent . To an outsider who had yet to make many friends , the prayer circles had some compelling advantages . If you aimed your point of entry correctly , you could hold hands with a certain Ann or Julie and get feverish with her and want what she wanted , if just for a little while .
