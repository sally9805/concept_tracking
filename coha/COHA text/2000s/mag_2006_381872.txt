In Greek mythology , Eos was the goddess of dawn , a frisky immortal who liked to shack up with hunky gods and , on occasion , kidnap men for pleasure . Nowhere in Homer does it say anything about Eos and transportation . Yet in Volkswagen 's retelling , Eos has morphed into an elegant two-door convertible . The new VW Eos features a retractable hard top that 's a marvel of engineering , stowing in the rear at the flip of a switch and transforming a buttoned-up coupe into a sun-loving hellion . A car with features like that used to set you back at least $65,000 . But VW priced the Eos at just under $29,000 to attract midmarket shoppers  --  and , the company hopes , to help kick-start the brand . <P> VW could certainly use a sexy model to turn heads its way . Only a few years ago , VW was riding high with iconic cars like the Jetta and New Beetle , vehicles that delivered performance and brand charisma . But BMW 's Mini swiped the Beetle 's cool factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines better than Jetta . Sales in the U.S. plunged 37% from 2001 through 2005 , when VW sold just 224,195 cars . With a market share of just 1.4% , it 's outsold even by Kia . The North American business is a bleeder too , losing nearly $2 billion from 2004 through 2005 ( including sales of VW 's sister brand Audi ) . Worldwide , the Volkswagen Group posted revenues of $112.8 billion and profits of roughly $1.3 billion in 2005  --  a slim net gain .
