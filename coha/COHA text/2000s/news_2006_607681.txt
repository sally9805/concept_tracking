<p> As former Pro Bowl linebacker LaVar Arrington packed up his belongings at Redskins Park yesterday , he was optimistic that he would remain in Washington next season despite a tumultuous tenure with the team , while quarterback Patrick Ramsey , another former first-round pick , stuffed his bags into a U-Haul attached to a pickup truck , and left the facility for what may be the last time . <p> Arrington has spoken several times recently with owner Daniel Snyder , team sources said , and said he is willing to consider restructuring his contract to remain with the team . <p> As for Ramsey , earlier this season , team and league sources said he and Coach Joe Gibbs agreed that the Redskins would trade or release him in the offseason if he desired ; Gibbs declined to comment on any previous private conversations with the player , but said he and Ramsey met yesterday , made no final decisions on his future and agreed to speak again shortly . Gibbs also said he believes rookie quarterback Jason Campbell could have performed well if forced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nucleus of the Redskins already under contract for 2006 , decisions on Arrington , 27 , and Ramsey , 26 , will be among the biggest personnel issues facing the club , which rallied for six straight , late-season wins to reach the second round of the playoffs and post an 11-7 overall record . The Redskins will immediately seek contract extensions for many assistant coaches , who are entering the final season of their three-year deals , Gibbs said . " I want to get that done , " he said , adding that several assistants have pulled themselves from consideration for other jobs . The team will have to release several players and alter the contracts of others to get under a projected $95 million salary cap by March 1 . ( Washington 's 2006 figure now stands at $113 million , league sources said . ) <p> Arrington , once the very face of the organization , was benched and pulled from regular playing duty much of last season . He has the highest 2006 salary cap figure on the team , $12 million , has lashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach Dale Lindsey , and suffered through injuries the past two seasons . His once-close relationship with Snyder has suffered , particularly over a hearing regarding Arrington 's claim that $6.5 million was removed from his contract , but Arrington is hopeful that he will remain with the organization that drafted him second overall in 2000 . <p> While trading or releasing Arrington would provide cap relief beginning in 2007 , retaining him and converting his $6.5 million roster bonus ( due by July 15 ) to a signing bonus would actually benefit Washington 's 2006 cap situation ( he would count roughly $7 million rather than $12 million ) , and Arrington said he would be open to discussions about other ways to trim his cap number as well . Arrington asked for permission to seek a trade once before the season and again when benched for two games in September , league sources said , but since then has been adamant about remaining here . <p> " I 'm hoping to see what we can work out , " Arrington said of his contract . " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of late , I 'm optimistic . I 've started seeing things a lot clearer . " <p> When asked if the team would be willing to exercise Arrington 's option and keep him here , Gibbs said : " I think today was probably awful quick to be talking about some of that . We 'll proceed ahead these next few weeks and we 'll be thinking about all those things as we go . " <p> Ramsey , selected 32nd overall in 2002 , was here before Gibbs arrived ; the coach immediately acquired veteran Mark Brunell and traded three picks , including a first-rounder , to move up and take Campbell in the first round last year . Ramsey started the season opener , was yanked after 19 minutes , and never started again . He has made just 24 starts in four years here , and , with one year left on his rookie contract , badly wants a chance to start again , while Gibbs is enthusiastic that Campbell could play in 2006 . <p> " I feel confident had Jason been thrust into things this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , " Gibbs said . " We 've seen a lot out of him , and now he needs to play . I was laughing when I told him , ' Okay , take the hat off and throw it away ; you 're ready to go to work to earn your money . ' " <p> The New York Jets inquired about trading for Ramsey in September . Miami and Oakland are two other options for him , and several general managers said Ramsey likely would yield a mid-round pick in return . Ramsey would not commit to wanting to leave or return , and chose his words carefully , but is determined to play football next season . <p> " That was my concern when everything took place being benched , " Ramsey said . " I 'd like to play . If I 'm going to develop as a quarterback in this league and play well , I think it needs to start at some point soon . " <p> Gibbs said : " Patrick and I had a good talk and he felt a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with and he has n't had much chance to sit and think about anything and I have n't , either . So what we agreed to do is just continue to talk over these next few weeks . " <p> The Redskins are expected to seek another starting wide receiver after Santana Moss was a one-man army for much of 2005 . " I 've got the strong feeling next year that will happen , " defensive end Phillip Daniels said of adding a receiver . The team also could pursue depth at tight end and on the offensive line , and Gregg Williams , assistant head coach-defense , spoke on several occasions about adding a young defensive end . Washington also could seek upgrades at punter , place kicker and return specialist . <p> The team has few prominent free agents to re-sign , with starting safety Ryan Clark and tight end Robert Royal topping the list ; team officials have already been in negotiations with both , and want to retain both . Running back Rock Cartwright hopes to stay as well , but said he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Agents for several Redskins have been told that final negotiations likely will be on hold until the team gets closer to the $95 million salary cap . Gibbs met briefly with all the free agents yesterday to express interest in keeping most of them , particularly Clark , Royal and Cartwright . <p> The Redskins could restructure the contracts of several players with hefty base salaries  --  Brunell ( $4 million ) , tackle Jon Jansen ( $4 million ) and guard Randy Thomas ( $3.5 million )  --  and their 2006 cap numbers could be significantly decreased if the players agree to convert that salary to guaranteed bonuses . The team also has a host of players due hefty roster bonuses , such as Arrington , cornerback Shawn Springs ( $3.1 million ) and tailback Clinton Portis ( $3 million ) , but those bonuses can also be converted , allowing the team to spread a cap savings over four years as well . <p> Still , it could prove difficult for the Redskins to add any top-tier free agents , and they will face difficult decisions with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walt Harris , place kicker John Hall , wide receiver Taylor Jacobs and offensive lineman Cory Raymer , among others , given the need to create cap space . Overall , Gibbs 's priority will be to keep as much of this team together as possible . <p> " Everybody told me when I got back that with the salary cap you ca n't keep a team together , " Gibbs said . " I do n't believe that . So we 're going to work extremely hard to try and keep everybody together . "
