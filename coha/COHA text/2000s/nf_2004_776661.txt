Preface George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney have created the most secretive presidency of my lifetime . Their secrecy is far worse than during Watergate , and it bodes even more serious consequences . Their secrecy is extreme-not merely unjustified and excessive but obsessive . It has created a White House that hide sits president 's weaknesses as well as its vice president 's strengths . // It has given us a presidency that operates on hidden agendas . To protect their secrets , Bush and Cheney dissemble as a matter of policy . In fact , the Bush-Cheney presidency is strikingly Nixonian , only with regard to secrecy far worse ( and no one will ever successfully accuse me of being a Nixon apologist ) . Dick Cheney , who runs his own secret governmental operations , openly declares that he wants to turn the clock back to the pre-Watergate years-a time of an unaccountable and extra constitutional imperial presidency . To say that their secret presidency is undemocratic is an understatement . // I 'm anything but skittish about government , but I must say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live in , frighteningly dangerous . This conclusion is not that of a political partisan , for those days are long behind me ; rather , it is the finding of a concerned observer , with something of a distinct understanding and appreciation of the modern presidency . // I was initially astonished watching the Bush-Cheney presidency , not certain they realized the very familiar path ( at least to me ) that they were taking . Richard Nixon , who resigned his presidency thirty years ago , had many admirable strengths and qualities . His secrecy , which shielded his abuses of presidential power , was not among them . Thus , from time to time , I fired off flares , hoping to throw a bit of light-if not a warning-on where they were headed . I did so by raising these matters in my regular Find Law column . For one such column , in which I discussed the potential of impeachment if the Bush administration had intentionally manipulated government intelligence on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , an editor at Salon , which reprinted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - drawing his own conclusion from the material . // Three months later , Chris Matthews of MSNBC 's Hardball described the Bush administration 's revengeful act of leaking the name and CIA identity of the wife of an administration critic , former ambassador Joseph Wilson , as " worse than Watergate " ( ( for the leak was potentially life-threatening , given her undercover status , as well as against the law ) . Matthews made this comment in an exchange with the chairman of the Republican National Committee , Ed Gillespie , who to my surprise did not disagree . So while I ca n't claim original authorship for the title , when my editor suggested it for this book , I could not deny that it describes perfectly what I have to say in more ways than I had anticipated . // This book began as an admonition , an approach both " beware of Bush " and " Bush beware . " Only ignorance or bliss , I figured at the time , could lead another president and White House to make the same kind of mistakes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , and the post-9/11 activities and operations of Bush and Cheney unfolded , it was evident that these were carefully calculated policies and plans . No longer was I writing a warning , but rather an indictment , for I could not write and publish fast enough to get in front of the abuses of power and the emerging ends-justify-the-means mentality , and even if I could have , it would not have made any difference , for they understood exactly what they were doing and why . Stated a bit differently , I 've been watching all the elements fall into place for two possible political catastrophes , one that will take the air out of the Bush-Cheney balloon and the other , far more disquieting , will take the air out of democracy . Allow me to explain . // To compare the Bush-Cheney presidency with Nixon 's tenure and Watergate and assert that it is worse than Watergate is not a charge to be made lightly . Nor do I-Watergate symbolizes totally unacceptable presidential behavior . Dictionary definitions of the term Watergate typically describe this unacceptable conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for political purposes . Watergate , of course , was a very messy presidential scandal and a political disaster for Nixon . Certainly no comparable scandal has occurred during the Bush-Cheney tenure-at least not yet . Scandals have a way of smoldering before erupting , as has occurred with every major presidential scandal-Teapot Dome , Watergate , Iran-Contra , and L'affaire Lewinsky . There are simply too many problems rumbling just below the surface of the Bush-Cheney presidency to avoid making the comparison . // Former attorney general ( and later secretary of state ) William Rogers once advised that " the public should view excessive secrecy among government officials as parents view sudden quiet where youngsters are playing . It is a sign of trouble . " Woodrow Wilson , based on his long study of statecraft , concluded that " everybody knows that corruption thrives in secret places , and avoids public places , and we believe it a fair presumption that secrecy means impropriety . " Thus , undue secrecy not only is undemocratic , denying the public its right to know , but also schools scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of impropriety . And we have a presidency that seeks to control , if not suppress , everything . // Political pollster John Zogby tells us that Democrats are from Venus and Republicans are from Mars , and based on my examination of the Bush II White House vis- ? - vis his predecessor , I 'm inclined to agree . In short , nothing suggesting a sex scandal blipped on my screen . On the other hand , the potential for a serious financial and/or power scandal , as I discovered , is quite real . // In addition , there is another state of affairs with the Bush-Cheney presidency that is worse than any scandal and far worse than Watergate . In General Tommy Franks 's first interview as a civilian shortly after he departed as four-star head of Central Command , when discussing what he thought Americans should be thinking about concerning terrorism , he asked rhetorically , " What is the worst thing that can happen ? " His answer is chilling . Franks has no doubt whatsoever that upon obtaining a weapon of mass destruction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should happen , Franks believes the Western world may lose " what it cherishes most , and that is freedom and liberty we 've seen for a couple of hundred years in this grand experiment that we call democracy . " He has reached that conclusion because he feels that there exists " the potential of a ... massive casualty-producing event somewhere in the western world-it may be in the United States of America-that causes our population to question our own Constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass , casualty-producing event . Which in fact , then begins to unravel the fabric of our Constitution . " // I agree with General Franks , but I suspect for very different reasons . Watching the responses of Bush and Cheney to 9/11 , their obsessive secrecy , their endless political manipulation and exploitation of 9/11 , their blatant suppression of rights and liberties of foreigners , their taking our nation to its first " preventive war " as aggressors in Iraq , their distortion of intelligence gathering , their Nixon-like rationalizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack against America one day-we have the wrong leaders . Not because they are not able or well motivated or " real Americans , " as President Lyndon Johnson used to say-for they are all those things . But they are also zealots who are convinced of their own wisdom , oblivious to not only what Americans think but the opinions of the entire world . Former Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis once spoke of this problem : " The greatest danger to liberty lurks in the insidious encroachment by men of zeal , well-meaning but without understanding . " If the dreaded event that General Franks has raised occurs ( and as I explain , this presidency may actually attract such an event ) , there is good reason to fear for the fabric of our Constitution . // It goes without saying that it would be best to have neither a scandal nor something far worse . There is , however , only one antidote : an end to the obsessive , unjustified , and disproportionate secrecy that defines the Bush-Cheney White House . In addressing these matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that these potential problems are very real , not fanciful concerns , and should not be ignored . In thinking about how best to set forth the disquieting circumstances , I selected the only form of discourse that seems fitting , a polemic . Polemic comes from the Greek word polemikos- " of or relating to war . " // That , of course , is the current situation . By tradition , polemics are first-person , strongly felt , and relatively brief . Though polemics often indict , those that simply trash are worthless . Whether one accepts or rejects his argument , an example of a classic polemic is Christopher Hitchens 's The Case Against Henry Kissinger . Hitchens 's case is powerfully presented , compellingly and closely argued , and ardent without being strident or unduly nasty . On the other hand , Peggy Noonan 's polemic , The Case Against Hillary Clinton , provided me with a perfect model of what I did not want to do : invent facts , appeal to emotions rather than intelligence , engage in vicious name-calling , and fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously , whereas Noonan 's effort is easily dismissed . // By way of preface I must add that I do not believe in conspiracy theories . I use terms such as " shadow national security council , " " secret government , " and " hidden agenda " because they are descriptive of actual facts , not theory . In addition , I have provided detailed documentation ( as chapter notes , along with occasional footnotes ) not only to show where information was found but to provide access to it for others . As noted in the Acknowledgments , I have talked ( or exchanged e-mails ) with a lot of people while working on this project , and many wished to remain off-the-record , for reasons I understand and explain . I decided to make virtually all these sources off-the-record because they were not necessary to state my case , so only in rare instances have I quoted from any of these sources , and never for any point of particular significance . Rather , this information was used as leads , confirmation , insights about Bush or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find answers to the myriad questions that arise with such widespread secrecy . // In the chapters that follow , I begin where this inquiry started , with my discovery of the surprising Nixon-like traits of George W. Bush . When looking at him closely , though , I noted the early-warning signs of the undue Bush-Cheney secrecy . What at first appeared only a penchant for secrecy I soon realized was a policy of concealment that they exercised throughout the 2000 campaign . I 've used examples of their campaign stone walling because they have morphed into White House stonewalling. // Once ensconced in their offices at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , they quietly closed their doors , pulled the shades , and began making themselves increasingly inaccessible to the media and Congress while demanding complete control over government information . Government under a virtual gag order became their standard operating procedure . // In looking at the Bush-Cheney White House , I found it not unlike Nixon 's in that it spends far more time crafting the president 's public image and working on the politics of reelection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what clearly distinguishes this presidency is its vice president , a secretive man by nature whose unmatched power is largely veiled but whose secret governmental operations have changed the world-and not for the better . Dick Cheney , effectively a co-president incognito , works behind closed doors and does not answer to Congress or the public . His partner , the president , is not sufficiently knowledgeable about their policies to answer questions about them adequately , if and when he does occasionally make himself available . It is not that he is stupid , only ignorant-and apparently by design . Yet time and again , their principal public policies-both foreign and domestic-are laden with hidden agendas. // The Bush-Cheney hidden agenda I have focused on relates to their national security policies , given their critical importance . Equally worthy of attention is their hidden agenda to end federal entitlement programs by running up budget-busting deficits while hiking military spending , which is bleeding the federal treasury and will ultimately result in there simply being no money available to pay for social programs after this administration is gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Medicare-that they dare not eliminate . But economic and fiscal policy is not my forte , so rather than merely repeating the conclusions of others whose judgment I respect , I have stayed with matters that I fully understand . // I have made no effort to write a history of all their sorry activities . Instead , I have merely drafted a bill of particulars , setting forth a sampling of their secrecy indicative of their policies and practices that demand the public 's attention . This material , found in chapters two to five , provides overwhelming evidence that their secrecy is out of hand and that it has become so pervasive and troubling that it must be called sinister , for it has dreadful potential consequences for all Americans . // Perhaps , as one historian mentioned to me , the best model for a polemic is Thomas Paine 's Common Sense . After all , Paine 's tract blasted a monarchy headed by a fellow named George , and he called it as he saw it . Both Paine 's undertakings are certainly compatible with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixonian nature of the Bush presidency , then by proceeding through a number of particularly disquieting instances of the Bush-Cheney secrecy-not a complete catalog but more than sufficient to establish their mentality-which started with the 2000 campaign , progressed at the White House , and has resulted in the most abusive use of secrecy in the modern presidency . My hope along the way is not to scandalmonger , but rather to spray as much antiscandal disinfectant-called light-as I possibly can . //
