Talk to her is not just a title . to Pedro Almodovar , the film 's brilliant writer-director , it is a command , an imperative . To this delightfully voluble man , conversation is love 's music , its best rationale and possibly its most haunting residue . <P> But in this great , profoundly witty and unique movie , he has placed what seems to be an insuperable barrier to love 's songs , sighs and whispers : the two women at the heart of the film are in a coma , thereby rendered silent , impervious to anything their lovers , hovering in their hospital rooms , might say . <P> This is of no consequence to Benigno ( Javier Camara ) . Sexually innocent , he learned caregiving by tending his invalid mother . He has transferred his skills and affections to Alicia ( Leonor Watling ) , a ballet dancer struck down in an auto accident . He scarcely knows her . He fell in love with her from afar and exchanged only a few words with her as he quietly stalked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her  --  mostly about music , plays and movies , including an erotic silent film , brilliantly concocted by Almodovar , in which a tiny , shrunken man is seen traversing the nude body of the lover who shrank him . <P> Marco ( Dario Grandinetti ) , Talk to Her 's other bereft male , is Benigno 's opposite . He 's a journalist who has fallen in love with a subject , a female matador named Lydia ( Rosario Flores ) . Before her bullring goring , their relationship was the reverse of Benigno and Alicia 's  --  relentlessly , often tormentedly verbal , because each was still emotionally involved with a previous lover . But now Marco sits mute and helpless by Lydia 's bedside , articulating his pain only to his new friend Benigno . <P> Up to this point , the movie 's message is clear  --  a variation on E.M . Forster 's famous dictum " Only connect . " Now , though , Almodovar raises the stakes . The silent movie turns out to be the symbolic heart of the film . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real transgression : he makes love to helpless Alicia  --  and impregnates her . <P> Escandalo . Contempt . Prison . But also , for Alicia , a miracle  --  a birth and , yes , a rebirth . For us in the audience , there is nothing but bliss as we acknowledge the perfect dramatic balance Almodovar has achieved between his characters ' states of being  --  between hope and fatalism , action and passivity , speech and silence . <P> Stasis is always a danger when the emotional forces of a film are so neatly measured out . But formalism is a beginning , not an end , for Almodovar . For his sensibility is shaped by Spanish Surrealism and giddily influenced by his love for the sober-delirious improbabilities of old-fashioned American movie genres . He offers this rich blend , he says , " in the most natural presentation possible : dreams without any change in lighting . " In short , his is a cinema wildly alive to unsettling juxtapositions and strange coincidences , at once true to the banalities of life as we generally see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live inside our minds .
