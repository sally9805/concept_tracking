<p> THE drug sales representative was expecting a $12,000 performance bonus . Unfortunately , the rep 's chance to jump to a better job at another drug company required that the move be made a month before the bonus would be issued . Was it possible to start the new job without the old employer knowing and still collect the bonus ? <p> " Wow , here 's a topic we have never done before , " marveled an unidentified respondent to the equally anonymous rep , who disclosed the desire to " double dip " last month on a bulletin board at cafepharma.com . <p> Nothing , it seems , is off limits at Cafepharma , a water-cooler site where , for the last six years , drug and medical-device sales reps have hashed out their lives and work in tens of thousands of discussion threads . <p> Cafepharma includes plenty of news about the health care industry , but its main attraction is the profanity-laced bulletin boards , where many of the industry 's 100,000-plus sales representatives vent their frustrations and fears . All but buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information or advice based on intimate knowledge of the industry . Others who read it include investors , plaintiffs ' lawyers , health care bloggers , journalists and recruiters , though they rarely post anything . <p> " Everyone says they do n't read it , but they do , " said Lloyd Mandel , the founder and a senior consultant at Atlantic Management Resources , a recruiting company in Warren , N.J. , focused on health care sales jobs . " There 's a lot of disgruntled people posting , but I have found out about companies that are expanding from the site , and when we post jobs there , we get a very good response from qualified reps . " <p> The problem is that only industry insiders can figure out which postings are accurate , said Jane Chin , a former saleswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb who now runs a training blog called PharmRepClinic.com . " People who post anonymously can tell the truth , but the signal-to-noise ratio is ridiculous , " she said . <p> Cafepharma has had more than 1.5 million posts in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its bulletin boards are divided into health care specialties , regions and individual companies , with general topics like life outside work . <p> The discussions range over general subjects like selling tips and layoffs , and more specific ones like how to deal with an unbearable boss who occasionally comes along on sales calls . One poster had this advice for such a situation : Have a couple of friendly doctors in reserve who will meet with you and the boss on short notice and make you look good . <p> Then there is the " lost civilizations " board , home for talking about companies that have disappeared in mergers . Companies like Syntex are long gone but recalled fondly , while anger and anxiety permeate posts about recently acquired companies like Kos Pharmaceuticals . " As with a nuclear disaster , the living envy the dead , " wrote one Kos poster in a recap of a sales-training session that the company 's new owner , Abbott Laboratories , ran for the merged sales force in March . <p> Numerous threads name and comment on the management shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of love affairs with customers and colleagues , although , truth be told , any subject attracting more than a few responses can veer without warning into sexual putdowns and other vulgarity . <p> " There 's some pretty harsh commentary , and it 's not just generalizations , " said Jamie Reidy , a former salesman for both Eli Lilly and Pfizer and the author of " Hard Sell : The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman . " Mr. Reidy said he had been surprised to find some spot-on descriptions of managers he had known , and that when he looked at reports about a recent national meeting of Lilly 's oncology sales force , he said he felt as if he were right back in it , adding , " It was like catching up on a soap opera . " <p> Not surprisingly , Cafepharma lacks corporate fans . <p> Pfizer , the subject of the site 's most popular bulletin board , declined repeated requests to discuss Cafepharma . Shreya Prudlo , a spokeswoman , said that Pfizer monitored every " communication channel " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " viewed based on their accuracy and integrity . " <p> Medtronic , which has the busiest Cafepharma bulletin board among device makers , said , " We do not endorse sites like this one . " It said it monitored Cafepharma periodically to see if confidential or proprietary information had been posted . Cindy Resman , a spokeswoman , said that Medtronic had not asked Cafepharma to remove any information yet . <p> Sarah Palmer , Cafepharma 's Webmaster , said that scores of posts were removed each day for violating bans on advertising , spam , personal attacks and racist language , but she acknowledged that the screening did not cover every posting and was after the fact ; many postings that violated the policies have slipped through , she conceded . She said the site kept no information about who was posting or where they were . <p> Cafepharma has more than 18,000 individual visitors on an average weekday , said Ms. Palmer , who is also Cafepharma 's chief executive , chief financial officer and secretary . Ms. Palmer said she operated the site from her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . office in a Marietta , Ga. , shopping mall is listed with the State of Georgia as her work address . <p> Ms. Palmer , who said she had no background in the drug industry , said that her titles reflected the desire of Cafepharma 's owners to keep a low profile . Questions about the operations that she will not answer herself are referred by e-mail to Michael Bryan , who identifies himself as Cafepharma 's majority owner , director of business development and other full-time employee . <p> Mr. Bryan , who said he was 41 , said that he and his four partners were current or former pharmaceutical salesmen . He declined to identify which companies he and the others have worked for . He said that he had worked as a rep for several years after Cafepharma began , and is afraid that any publicity might result in legal action against him by his former employers . <p> Although Cafepharma , which supports itself from advertising , only recently became profitable enough to give him a job , Mr. Bryan 's fears about fallout from creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns raised in the recent discussion on double dipping by the rep expecting a bonus . <p> The latest advice  --  posted May 21  --  might serve as a verdict on the whole Web site as a source of reliable information : " Do n't count on it .
