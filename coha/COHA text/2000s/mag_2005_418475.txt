Eunice Gibson received a double-lung transplant in 2002 and works as a nurse consultant at Morningside Adult Day Care Center in Los Angeles . // YOU know that old saying ? The one about second chances ? If s not always true . Sometimes , in life , there are second chances . It 's often at those times when you expect the worst that your destiny goes in reverse and you get to add more years to your legacy . For organ recipients , second chances are a reality-an opportunity for a new or improved life . In the African-American community , organ donation has historically been a difficult subject . Of the more than 87,000 people on the nation 's growing transplant waiting list , more than 25 percent of them are Black , according to research . Experts say that African-Americans as a group have a greater-than-average need for organ and tissue transplantation because of the relatively high incidence in this population of certain medical conditions-high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease and kidney disorders-that can cause permanent organ damage . Social mores or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has meant that fewer Blacks consent to organ donation . Because it 's easier to match blood and tissue type to a person of the same ethnicity , that means that many Blacks have languished on transplant lists for years . " I think it 's a complex issue , " says Dr. Robert Higgins , professor and chairman of the department of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago . " It 's not the right thing for everybody , but everybody has to be informed about the potential in organ and tissue donation-you could affect or save five , 10 or even 15 lives . It 's still an extraordinary thing . " EUNICE GIBSON 'S STORY For Eunice Gibson , 53 , of Los Angeles , that " extraordinary thing " has meant a reinvention . Diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and secondary pulmonary hypertension in 1996 , her lungs were so damaged , one doctor told her she was going to die . " My reaction was , Tm going to die ? ! ' ' " recalls Gibson , a registered nurse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipient , credits her sister , Mary E. Carter , with helping her through eight years of kidney disease and dialysis. // She was without hope until one doctor told her that she had the option of a double-lung transplant . Gibson was placed on the transplant list in 1999 , and the disease progressed to the point where she could hardly do anything on her own . As someone who was always the " strong one " in the family , it was a hard pill to swallow . After two failed attempts , Gibson got the call she was waiting for on February 7 , 2002 . " This is n't going to happen , " Gibson recalls thinking , because of the earlier false alarms . " The next thing I knew they were taking my bed to the operating room . " There was no time to be frightened , no time to think about it , really-only time to say a quick goodbye to her family , including her partner Gina Drew . By all accounts , the surgery was a success , but Gibson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four months , but she has a set of healthy lungs , thanks to a female donor-also an RN-about her age who lived in South Carolina . " At the time during recovery , I did n't want to ask about the donor , " says Gibson , who volunteers as an advocate for organ donation through the One Legacy Foundation . " But that became something that was really missing for me . " In April , she received a letter from the donor 's sisters , and their continued correspondence has driven the point home even more that this second chance is truly a precious gift . " I asked God to keep me alive because my work was n't done , " says Gibson , who works part time as an RN consultant . " As I felt better , I came to realize that everything that had happened to me meant that I have a path to follow . " JOANN C. DuBOSE 'S STORY Sometimes God has a way of bringing life full circle , says Joann C. DuBose , a homemaker and seamstress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosed with high blood pressure when she was 20 years old . About 10 years ago , she went in for a routine checkup , and the doctors told her to come to the hospital immediately . She had renal disease , just like her mother . " They called me on a Sunday , " DuBose remembers . " I was 44 years old . My mother died at 44 from end-stage renal disease . My first thought was , Tm going to die . ' ' " But her mother did n't have the same opportunities that DuBose did . The kidney disease was robbing her body of the ability to get rid of waste and toxins . So she began dialysis , the process in which a machine filters waste and toxins . A year later , her name was placed on a transplant list and she began to wear a beeper that would be her lifeline . " I was experiencing fatigue and weight loss-you literally waste away , " she says . " There were days where I had to sit down and brush my teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , " I 'm tired-I want to be delivered from this , and not through death . ' ' " Shortly after that , she received a call late one night with the message that they had a kidney for her . It was May 8 , 2003 . " My donor was an 18-year-old girl who died in an accident . I have one of her kidneys , " says DuBose , who speaks out on the importance of organ donation in the African-American community through " Linkages to Life , " a program sponsored by The Links , Inc . " When you donate , you change the life of more than one person . Our people have a lot of stigmas about organ donation . But you have to think about how many people 's lives you can touch . " Photograph John Truitt Jr . received a heart transplant in May 2004 . Truitt , who lives in a Chicago suburb , says without his mother , Earldine Truitt , and the rest of his family , he would n't have made it . // Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her rock . She took care of her , offered her support , and prayed with and for her . To be able to experience such a turnaround has been a huge blessing for all of them . " I feel great , " DuBose says . " If you 've ever been born again , that 's the only way you 'll have a clue as to how I feel now . I feel new . " JOHN TRUITT JR . ' S STORY It was all so strange . To have a heart attack in your 20s . Yet , there John Truitt Jr . was , at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago , suffering from congestive heart failure brought on by cardiomyopathy , the same condition that led to his father 's death seven years ago . " It came on me suddenly , " says Truitt , who lives in Maywood , Ill. , and is a patient of Dr. Higgins . " My heart was the size of a softball . " Truitt was 25 years old at the time , and the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an electrician . Coincidentally , his father was sick at that time , too , and when he died , that just added to the stress and caused Truitt to lose hope . Reluctant to go on the transplant list because of a debilitating fear of needles , Truitt had another heart attack in December 2003 . The doctor told him that if he waited much longer , he might not live . Truitt went on the list . In May of last year , his beeper went off , signaling that a new heart was waiting for him at the hospital . " I did n't know whether to run or walk-to or from the hospital , " Truitt recalls . " I was scared . " Now , just over a year later , Truitt is feeling good , although he still has headaches. he does n't know much about his donor ; it 's still too intimate to have someone else 's heart beating inside of him . " It 's just like a second chance , " Truitt says . " If s all because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be possible without Him . " Dr. Kimberly Arriola , an assistant professor in the School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta , has been surveying area churches , researching African-American attitudes about organ donation . The key issue , she says , is a lack of knowledge and awareness of this issue , not a lack of compassion . The only way to combat this lack of awareness is to provide information , to make it real for people . It 's about putting a face on organ donation-giving a face a second chance , Dr. Arriola says . " We as Black folks are dying . " <p>
