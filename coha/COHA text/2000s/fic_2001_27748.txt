The storms do n't come into the city anymore . When I was a little boy , when we had evaporative cooling and Kennedy was president , the late-summer monsoons swept into Arizona from the Sea of Cortez and cooled Phoenix with wind and rain . Now the city has become a concrete slab eighty miles across and the weather has changed . Most times , we can only see the clouds hovering out beyond the mountains , dropping precious rain on the desert , tantalizing us with lightning , leaving us with dust . It was July High summer in Phoenix , when a temperature of 105 degrees is a relief and workaday guys in traffic jams can turn into killers if they get into a fender bender . It 's the time of year when the asphalt gets so hot , it can leave second-degree burns on your skin ; when $350-a-night resorts hold half-price sales , and everybody who can afford it heads to the ocean ; when the air-conditioning of 3 million people pushes the power grid to the edge of a shutdown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked tractor-trailer brings a resigned shrug . My hometown . I had been back in Phoenix for exactly six weeks , back in the house that had belonged to my grandparents , the house where I grew up . It was a small Spanish Mediterranean two blocks west of Central on Cypress Avenue , surrounded by oleander hedges , orange trees , and palms . Grandfather built the house in 1924 . During the years I was gone , the city had taken to calling the area the Willo Historic District . When I was a kid , it was just a neighborhood and everybody knew everybody else . Now my grandparents had been dead for years , and the families that lived nearby had moved away . The neighborhood was supposed to be popular with young professionals . I hoped so . I needed to sell the house and find a new job . It was a Sunday evening , the worst time of the week to be alone . Ellington was on the CD player , the 1956 Newport concert . I was about half a martini away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees outside the big picture window and the doorbell rang . Maybe I 'd been a little isolated for those six weeks , but it occurred to me that I had n't heard the doorbell for years , at least since Grandmother was still alive . The deep clang put a stake of dread in me that usually comes with late-night phone calls . Then I opened the door and saw a ghost . " David Mapstone ! " The ghost knew my name and rushed to give me a hug . At five feet five , she could fit completely inside my arms and have the top of her head nestle under my chin . Once upon a time , her name had been Julie Riding , my first lover . I blathered the nervous small talk of unexpected reunions and invited her inside . In the high-ceilinged living room , she sat in one of the leather chairs that face the picture window and accepted my offer of a drinkscotch , neat . I poured her a couple of fingers of McClelland 's and then sat opposite her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't believe you 're back in town , " she was saying in a bright alto chirp . She wore a short summer dress that was a little too young for her . But she still had damn nice legs and she knew it . Her hair was a couple of shades darker than the honey color that I remembered , and it was shorter now , businesslike , above the shoulders . Time was beginning to cut itself into the skin around her eyes , but they were still the darkest blue I had ever seen , the color of the dusk sky in the mountains . She was saying how little the house had changed , how she was sorry to hear about my grandmother 's death a few years before , how she 'd tried to keep up with my teaching career after I left town . Then she turned red and downed the scotch in one gulp . I refilled her glass , and she did n't stop me . " Shit , " she said , the chirp gone from her voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I know it sounds forced . I know how strange it seems for me just to show up suddenly , when I walked out the way I did . Now , here I am . Wanting something . " I filed that away " I just thought you 'd been held up a really long time in the ladies ' room . " " David , it 's been twenty years . " My head is always full of dates1066 , 1492 , 1789 , 1914 . It 's an occupational hazard when you teach history . The last time I saw Julie Riding was just before Christmas 1979 , when she sat across from me in a dark little bar near the university and said she did n't want to see me anymore . She was in love with someone else , she said . He was older andlet me remember this right " was a real world-beater , " which I took to mean he had money . I was just a college student with a smoky old convertible . For months after that , amid various stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living without meI have a very vivid imaginationand what I would say and do if she ever came back . But as my life began to change , she faded from my thoughts , until the years pushed her into that fond drawer of occasional memory reserved for first lovers . Now she was here in my living room and part of me was feeling odd , but another part was feeling as if she 'd been gone about twenty minutes . Mostly , I was just glad for the company . " Do you mind ? " She produced a Marlboro Light from her purse . I shook my head . She lit it and took a drag that sounded soothing even from where I was sitting . " I 'm seriously addicted , " she said . We sat in silence awhile , watching the clouds and wind flow in from the east ; then a curtain of dust began to fall out of the sky . I leaned forward and just let her find her words . She played with her hair , pushing it back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look great , " she said finally I was wearing jeans and a white polo shirt , nothing special . " No , I mean it . It 's like you 've really grown into your face . You 're going to be a hell of a good-looking middle-aged man . " " Thanks , I think , " I said . " Our birthdays are two weeks apart , remember ? " She sipped her scotch and gave me a sly smile . " David , it 's the strangest thing . I was at the Hard Rock Cafe with some girlfriends one night , and there was Mike Peralta at the bar . He was n't in uniform , of course , and he looked like he was with some pretty high-powered people , but I just went over and gave him a hug , I mean , my God , it had been about as long as since I 'd last seen you . " Anyway , I asked about you , and Mike said you were back in Phoenix and working for the Sheriff 's Office again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I am . My God , are you a deputy again ? I thought that was just your youthful adventure . " She stubbed out the butt and lit another , melting a little into the chair . " Deputy David Mapstone of the Old West . " She giggled . I smiled at her , glad to provide amusement for an old girlfriend . Some people decide at age fourteen that they 're going to be accountants , and that 's all they do for their whole lives . My resume is a little more complicated . Especially after this summer . " I 'm just doing a little consulting . Researching some old cases for Peralta . I 'm in between jobs . " " So you 're not teaching ? " she asked . " Your great dream was to be a history professor , I thought . " Since when do we get our great dreams ? I thought , getting up to refresh our drinks . I said over my shoulder , " The tenure committee at San Diego State did n't like me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s in history , anyway . Something will come up . " She followed me into the kitchen . " When did you start drinking martinis ? " " When I was married to a millionaire 's daughter . " " Dorothy Parker said martinis lead to all sorts of sexual misjudgments , " Julie said absently , then added , " What was her name ? " " Dorothy Parker ? " " Your ex-wife , you goof . " " Patty , " I said . " Good boomer name , " Julie said . " All those fathers in lust with Patti Page . Kids ? " " No . " " And you 've been divorced about a year ? " " Mmmhmm . " " I can tell it in your voice , " she said . She was n't wearing a wedding ring . I looked out the window at the garden courtyard , where a palm tree was dancing slowly in the wind . We were n't going to get any rain . Julie Riding in my kitchen , talking about my divorce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell ? " She smiled . " Life goes on . I 'm divorced . My daughter 's fourteen , and she just made cheerleader . I 'm in marketing at the Phoenician resort , and I work all the time . " She made it sound like a neat package . Finally , she asked , " Do you remember my little sister ? Phaedra . " Now we were down to the " wanting something " part of the evening . I said I remembered an eight-year-old kid . Truth was , I barely remembered her sister at all . A skinny kid with red hair who played the cello and had an odd name . She was in the background one night when Julie took me home to meet her parents , and they all had a big fight . Mostly , I remembered her name , Phaedra . Not a popular boomer name . " She 's twenty-eight now , David , " Julie said . " And she 's missing . " " Have you been to the cops ? " I asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? They told me she was an adult and that unless there was some indication of foul play , there was n't much they could do . " " So what can I do ? " " I know you have friends in the Sheriff 's Office . Even if you 're just a consultant . Maybe you could ask around ? " The blue eyes implored . " It 's been two weeks since she was supposed to come over for dinner . I have n't had a call , nothing . Her apartment has n't been slept in . " " New boyfriend ? " " That 's never made her drop off the face of the earth . " " What about her job ? " She shook her head . " Phaedra was kind of in between careers . She was working at a photo studio . She had a lot of gifts , but she never did well playing the game at work , you know what I mean ? " As a matter of fact , I did . I asked , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ? " Julie paused and the tip of her cigarette glowed contemplatively . " This is a very dangerous city , and she 's a pretty young woman . What more do you need ? " I promised to ask some questions around the Sheriff 's Office . Julie smashed out the cigarette , and it was time to leave . I walked her out to her car . The storm had blown through , and the night was dusty , hot , and expectant . " You 're back in time for the monsoon season , " she said , aiming her key chain at a silver Lexus , which beeped attentively . " You 're down in the barrio now , " she said . " I guess . I have n't lived in this house for a long time . " " It 's all coming back down here , " she said , starting up the car . " Close-in city living . " I watched her drive her car to the end of the block and disappear around the corner . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start .
