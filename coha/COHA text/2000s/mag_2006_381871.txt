Patricia McCormick is not the kind of writer who sits at her keyboard waiting for inspiration . She 's the kind of writer who finagles her way into a Kathmandu jail to interview a young Nepali man awaiting trial . He told McCormick without a hint of embarrassment that he had sold his fianc . Why ? " Because I wanted a motorcycle , " he replied . He then laughed with his jailers , knowing he would probably get off . <P> And she journeyed with a group rescuing prostitutes to a tiny Nepali village , where mothers were warned that the adolescent daughters they thought they were sending to jobs in the city were actually being sold into the sex trade . In many cases , it transpired , a family member  --  a brother , a father or an uncle  --  had made the sale . <P> So who does McCormick write for ? Kids . The research on the teen sex trade was for her new young-adult novel , Sold ( Hyperion Books for Children ; 263 pages ) . A journalist by training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not dry . Sold is told in poetic vignettes in the voice of Lakshmi , a 13-year-old girl who lives in rural Nepal . Life is grueling there for women young and old . " A girl is like a goat , " a local saying goes . " Good as long as she gives you milk and butter . But not worth crying over when it 's time to make a stew . " Her stepfather sells her for 800 rupees to a woman who spirits her off to a brothel in Calcutta . If the book sounds grim , it is . It 's also the stuff awards committees love ; Sold was just nominated for a Young People 's National Book Award . <P> Hyperion recommends the book for readers 12 years old and up , but its language makes it accessible to younger children . McCormick , who has two grown children , is adamant that young readers will benefit from knowing the truth about this pernicious practice . " If you 're 12 , I think you 'll understand what 's happening , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hit you the same way if you 're too young for the book . " While the book is blunt , it is never sensational : " Men come . They crush my bones with their weight . They split me open , " says Lakshmi . And it is less about sex than about coercion and commerce and the eventual triumph of will . At heart , McCormick admits , she is an activist . " I could n't write this book fast enough , " she says , " because I felt such urgency to have the situation understood . " <P> Sold is not McCormick 's first foray into controversial material . Her much lauded debut novel , Cut , which sold nearly 400,000 copies , is the first-person story of Callie , a girl who has been institutionalized for cutting herself . Not everyone likes McCormick 's gritty approach . Some librarians have declined to buy Cut , fearing copycat behavior . <P> McCormick 's talent lies in rendering stark facts vividly but not melodramatically . Just as Sold 's brothel , Happiness House , smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , " her novel has several scents , some lovely , some harsh . Having had success with self-mutilation and prostitution , she 's taking on a less physical anguish in her next novel . It 's about a 15-year-old girl whose brother is killed in Iraq . Awards committees , take note .
