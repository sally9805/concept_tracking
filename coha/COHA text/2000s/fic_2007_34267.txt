" Bite My Beak ! " " Uno ! " I cried . I slapped my cards down on the table . " Pay up , guys . Pay up . " Sherman Oaks , that spoiled , rich brat , pulled some money from his gold money clip . He shook his head . " You 've won every game , Bernie . I 'm down to my last five hundred dollars ! " " When you 're hot , you 're hot , " I said , taking his money . " Come on , total up your cards , Feenman . You owe me big-time ! " Across the table , my friend Crench groaned . " Bernie , you 're unbelievable . How can one person win twenty Uno games in a row ? " I flashed him my million-dollar grin . " Guess I 'm just lucky ! " I reached up to my shoulder and petted Lippy , my adorable parrot . " Awwwk . Beak me ! Bite my beak ! I 'll pluck your eyes ! " He squawked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those cute things ? He dug his claws into my shoulder as I tickled his feathers . That adorable parrot always warms my heart . Across the card table , Sherman 's pal Wes Updood was still counting his cards . " Do all worms come from Ohio ? " he muttered . " Even Gummi Worms ? That 's just totally Toledo-know what I mean ? " Wes is the coolest dude at Rotten School . He 's so totally cool , noone can understand a word he says ! " Goat 's milk , " Wes muttered . " What 's up with goats , anyway ? Do they have to be so short ? That 's totally Toledo . Yo ! " He went back to counting his Uno cards . Feenman yawned so hard , he fell off his chair . He sat on the floor and rubbed his red eyes . " Bernie , what time is it ? " Sherman raised his huge gold watch . The watch has so many jewels and so many gadgets , it weighs nearly forty pounds . Sherman usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whoa , " he said , squinting at the flashing dial . " You would n't believe the temperature on Mars ! " " I just want to know the time , " Feenman said , curling up on the floor . " It 's six in the morning , " I said . I pointed to the clock on the wall . " Time to pluck your nose ! " Lippy chirped . He dug his claws deeper into my shoulder . Wes and Sherman stood up , shaking their heads , watching me count my winnings . " See you , guys , " Sherman said , starting to the door . " Rather be you than see you , " Wes said . Did that make any sense ? You probably go home after school every day . But our school is a boarding school . That means we live here . We can do whatever we want . No parents ! And that means staying up all night ! We have our all-night Uno tournaments in a tiny back room in the Student Center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knows we are here . When we sneak back to our dorms , we have to be very careful . I do n't know why-but for some reason , Headmaster Upchuck does n't approve of all-night card games . Sherman and Wes closed the door behind them . Crench jumped to his feet . " Bernie , tell me your secret , " he said . " How did you win every game ? Tell me ! How ? " He grabbed the front of my shirt-and knocked Lippy off my shoulder . " Awwwwwwwk ! " The bird let out a cry as he hit the floor . Then he was silent . " Oh no ! " I gasped . I spun away from Crench and dropped to the floor in a panic.I scooped up the parrot in my hands . " Lippy , speak to me ! " I cried . " Speak to me ! " " Make my day ! Choke on a cuttlebone ! " Lippy squawked . I cradled Lippy against my chest . " Thank goodness you 're okay . " Feenman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring that squawking bird to all our card games ? " he asked . " Yeah , he 's just a stupid bird . What 's the big deal ? " Crench said . My two best buddies in the world , and they did n't understand . " Hel-lo ! " I said . " Just a stupid bird ? I do n't think so ! Want to know how I win every game ? You 're looking at him ! It 's Lippy . He 's a lucky bird ! "
