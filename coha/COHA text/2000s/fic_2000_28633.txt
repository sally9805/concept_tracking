My cell is full of shadows . Hanging naked from a wire in the hall outside , a bulb casts light cut by rusted bars into thin strips that snake along the concrete floor and up the back wall . People like stains dissolve into the grayness . I sit alone , the drying smell of a man 's insides burning in my nostrils . Out of my imagination the footsteps of a guard approach , become real when a darkness silhouettes itself behind the bars and a shadow falls like blindness over the shadows in the cell . I hear the man who had been heaving scuttle into a corner , and then there is quiet . The guard calls my name . I hesitate before I rise to my feet and walk toward the bars , my back straight and chin up but my elbows tucked in close about the soft lower part of my rib cage . A hand slides out of the guard 's silhouette , offering me something , and I reach for it slowly , expecting it to be pulled back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , feeling the envelope smooth and sharp against my fingers . The guard walks away , pausing only to raise his hand and pluck delicately at the wire of the bulb , sending the light into an uneasy shivering . Someone curses , and I shut my eyes against the dizziness . When I open them again , the shadows are almost still and I can make out the grime on my fingers against the white of the envelope . My name in the handwriting of a woman I know well . I do n't read it , not even when I notice the damp imprints my fingers begin to leave in the paper . Chapter Two judgment ( before intermission ) You sit behind a high desk , wearing a black robe and a white wig , tastefully powdered . The cast begins to enter , filing into this chamber of dim tube lights and slow-turning ceiling fans . Murad Badshah , the partner in crime : remorselessly large , staggeringly , stutteringly eloquent . Aurangzeb , the best friend : righteously treacherous , impeccably dressed , unfairly sexy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lover . Three players in this trial of intimates , witnesses and liars all . They are pursued by a pair of hawk-faced men dressed in black and white : both forbidding , both hungry , but one tall and slender , the other short and fat . Two reflections of the same soul in the cosmic house of mirrors , or uncanny coincidence ? It is impossible to say . Their eyes flick about them , their lips silently voice oratories of power and emotion . To be human is to know them , to know what such beings are and must be : these two are lawyers . A steady stream of commoners and nobles follows , their diversity the work of a skilled casting director . They take their places with a silent murmur , moving slowly , every hesitation well rehearsed . A brief but stylish crowd scene , and above it all you preside like the marble rider of some great equestrian statue . Then a pause , a silence . All eyes turn to the door . He enters . The accused : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manacled , cuffed , disheveled , proud , erect . A man capable of anything and afraid of nothing . Two guards accompany him , and yes , they are brutes , but they would offer scant reassurance if this man were not chained . He is the terrible almost-hero of a great story : powerful , tragic , and dangerous . He alone meets your eyes . And then he is seated and it begins . Your gavel falls like the hammer of God . Perhaps a query ( Where did I get this thing ? ) flashes through your mind before vanishing forever , like a firefly in the belly of a frog . But the die has been cast . There is no going back . The case is announced . The prosecutor rises to his feet , and his opening remarks reek of closure . " Milord , " he says ( and he means you ) , " the court has before it today a case no less clear than the task of the executioner . The accused has stretched out his neck beneath the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this blade must fall . For he has blood on his hands , Milord . Young blood . The blood of a child . He killed not out of anger , not out of scheme or plan or design . He killed as a serpent kills that which it does not intend to eat : he killed out of indifference . He killed because his nature is to kill , because the death of a child has no meaning for him . " There can be no doubt here , Milord ; no more facts exist to be found . The balancing of scales awaits , Milord ; redress for wrong is come . Tender humanity screams in fear , confronted by such a monster , and conscience weeps with rage . The law licks its lips at the prospect of punishing such a one , and justice can shut its eyes today , so easy is its task . " The prosecutor pauses , his words leaping about the courtroom like shadows cast by unsheathed knives in the flickering light of some dying candle . " For this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
