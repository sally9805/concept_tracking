As if it did n't have enough problems with a soft ad market and a sinking stock price , the Walt Disney Co. has revealed to shareholders that it may owe several hundred million dollars because of a silly old bear . In 1961 Disney licensed certain rights to the character of Winnie-the-Pooh from literary agent Stephen Slesinger , who had acquired U.S. merchandising rights from A.A. Milne , author of the books featuring Pooh and Christopher Robin . That contract made no mention of videotapes , computer games or DVDs  --  because such uses either did n't exist or were n't widespread when the deal was made . <P> Now , though , Disney 's sales of Pooh products , including videos , DVDs and interactive storybooks , bring in more than $4 billion a year , making Pooh the most popular Disney character , ahead of even Mickey , according to lawyers for the heirs of Slesinger , now deceased . Disney denies that math , but the heirs are suing for back royalties of $500 million to $1 billion and unspecified punitive damages .

Characters can now be franchised from a book to a film and could eventually exist continuously on television , video , DVD and the Internet . <P> " As technology has blossomed , it has expanded the ways to exploit intellectual property and added greater value , " says Joseph Beard , a professor at St. John 's University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more valuable , such old-media distributors of content as publishers and photo agencies are discovering a new willingness by courts to leave them out in the cold . <P> When Random House signed publishing contracts in the ' 60s with such well-known authors as Kurt Vonnegut and William Styron , it included expansive language claiming all rights to publish the works in " book form . " To the company 's surprise , a federal appeals court recently affirmed a ruling that this language probably did not apply to electronic versions , or e-books . The lower court reasoned that because e-books are made up of changing digital signals sent over the Internet rather than of fixed texts on printed pages , they were not " books " under a traditional definition .
