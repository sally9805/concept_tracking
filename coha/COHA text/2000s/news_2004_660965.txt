<p> Spring comes slowly to Minnesota 's Iron Range . It 's home to the world 's largest hockey stick , a place where the lakes are still frozen in late April and vowels roll slowly off people 's tongues . For the past couple of decades , the region 's economy has seemed frozen as well , its bedrock mining industry slowly dying . <p> In the past year , however , a new life has been blowing into these ochre hills from an unlikely place . You see it in the noise and dust that spews , 24 hours a day , from the recently dormant iron mine just above town , and in the guarded optimism of residents , used to bad news and silent cranes that claw at some of the world 's largest open-pit mines . <p> In a weird twist on the typical globalization story , China is reviving a local economy that 's been one of the most stubborn pockets of unemployment in the United States . <p> The Asian nation 's insatiable appetite for steel fuels global demand for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel-producing nations around the globe turn out more ingots and flat wire , mines here are once again producing some of the raw material - though most of it is not going directly to Beijing or Shanghai . In one case , a Chinese company helped buy and reopen the bankrupt mine here in Eveleth , sending its ore to Canada to replace raw material bound for China . <p> Whatever its circuitous route , the result is the same : At a time when many Americans lament the loss of manufacturing jobs to China , steel mills there are producing jobs for lunch-pail workers here whose families have worked the mines for generations . <p> " If you 'd have said a year ago this would be happening , I 'd never have believed it , " says Joe Strlekar , president of local steelworkers 6860 , whose workers were already training for new jobs after being laid off in May , only to get their jobs back when the mine reopened . " Instead of everything coming back into this country from China , it 's good to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built on mining , in a very literal sense . Eveleth 's location was moved in 1900 , after iron was discovered beneath the town . Erie Mining created Hoyt Lakes from scratch , constructing houses , schools , streets , and shops . In Chisholm , the 81-foot statue of the " iron man " - a miner with pick and shovel , perched atop steel beams - stands guard over the carved-up red hills of the Mesabi Range , testament to a century of labor by the Finns , Serbs , Italians , and Slavs who settled this area . <p> Families here talk of uncles or grandparents blackballed for union work ; oral histories in the Iron World Research Center tell of mine accidents and polka dancing , of 12-hour night shifts and using Sears Roebuck catalogues to teach new arrivals English . <p> Since then , the region has struggled to diversify . Forestry and mining still provide the most coveted jobs . But only 4,000 mining jobs remain , down from 16,000 in 1980 , and many have wondered if Minnesota 's iron ore days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layoffs of the 1980s , and in 2001 the LTV mine - Erie 's successor - shut its doors for good , putting 1,400 people out of work . <p> So the news that the Eveleth mine was reopening in December came as a welcome surprise . With the dollar down and steel prices soaring , all six state mines are at full production for the first time in years . " It was a very nice Christmas here for a lot of people , " says Paul Bachschneider , president of the area Chamber of Commerce . <p> Bill Matos , a blaster at United Taconite who 's worked at that mine for 30 years , says the news was " bittersweet . " He was pleased to get his job back , but rues the old company 's bankruptcy , which froze his pension two months shy of retirement . " Now I 'll have to work at least five more years , " says Mr. Matos , in heavy boots and brown Carhartt overalls . <p> Matos always knew this was the work for him . His grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never wanted to leave . " If you want any pay , benefits , 40 hours a week , " he says , " you 'll be in the mines . " Some fellow miners went back to school when they lost their jobs last summer , to learn masonry , carpentry , or nursing . But Matos figured he was too old . <p> " Maybe I would have worked as a bus driver , " he says . " If I was younger , I could relocate , but I 'm rooted in here pretty well . " <p> These days , Matos says , miners are hopeful , though " even in good times , there 's skepticism . " He 's happiest for the community . Schools , spinoff industries , even car dealerships benefit , he says . " I 'd like to see it last another 20 years , for the people who work here , for the sake of the community . The schools are in bad shape . There 's nothing for young people . " <p> How long the boom can last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources , the outlook is reasonably good . Demand may slow , he says , but " China 's consumption will be there for a long time . " <p> The steel market has always been largely determined by transportation costs . Iron ore is a relatively cheap commodity , and it does n't pay to ship it long distances . So Minnesota and Michigan mines - which account for about 7 percent of the global production - typically ship only to mills near the Great Lakes . In recent years , the US has gotten more iron ore from big producers like Australia and Brazil , who 've glutted the market and lowered demand for raw material . <p> Because of the ore transportation costs , " there 's a limit to how far out you can go to be competitive , " says Mr. Clevenstine . " But with the world 's supply of iron ore going to China , we 've moved out that radius . " <p> Take US Steel 's plant in Fairfield , Ala. , which now gets its iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wrote that off as being best supplied by foreign ore , " says Clevenstine . " The economics have changed because of what the world ore price has done . " <p> But experts are quick to recognize the industry 's cyclical nature . The dollar could go up , and Brazil and Australia are increasing production to meet demand . " The momentary stability is a good thing , " says Frank Ongaro , president of the Iron Mining Association of Minnesota . He estimates that the six mines will spend a couple hundred million dollars more on equipment and services this year than last year , which will benefit the area . " But whether it lasts one year or five years , eventually we are going to return to being entirely dependent on the lower Great Lakes marketplace . " <p> Long term , some state officials hope other developments - like a value-added process allowing mills to turn out nearly pure and more valuable " iron nuggets " to be used by popular minimills - will help the region compete . They 're also hopeful about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the newly reopened United Taconite mine , workers are moving the 75,000 tons of rock that get processed every 24 hours . Yellow trucks that can move 190 tons crisscross the massive open pit , a wasteland of gray rubble . <p> Due in part to high World War II demand , all Minnesota 's high-grade natural ore was exhausted by the 1950s . Since then , local mining has been taconite - a rock that 's about 22 percent iron , and is processed into hard little pellets of more concentrated iron . <p> Drillers bore 16-inch diameter holes into the rock , which are filled with 2,500 pounds of explosives to break out the ore . The average age of miners here is 48 , and they 've worked at this mine an average of 25 years . It 's not an easy life , notes Superintendent Craig Hartmann . Most miners work a rotating mix of shifts that 's hard on family life . <p> But the prospect of retraining in a tight job market was far tougher , and Mr. Hartmann is glad to see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our blasts , " he says . " We make dust and noise . But I ca n't tell you how many townspeople were happy to feel those blasts again . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
