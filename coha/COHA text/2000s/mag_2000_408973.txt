Dear Dr. Cory : What are some ways to get my grandma to not smoke ? Amber Carter Oxon Hill , Maryland Dear Dr. Cory : My parents always smoked a lot . Now they do n't smoke as much . I saw this tape at school on drugs and smoking . It made me very scared . They said people could die from it . I do not want my parents to die . Do you have any suggestions on how to stop smoking ? Please help me . I 'm very worried about them . Thank you . Leigh Raskin Kendall Park , New Jersey Dear Amber and Leigh : Several products and programs are available to help people stop smoking . Some people find nicotine gum , skin patches , nasal spray , or inhalers helpful . Others have better luck using a non-nicotine , prescription drug called Zyban . A recent study showed that it was twice as effective as the nicotine patch in helping people quit . However , using both products together was found to be even more effective . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink a great deal of water or take a shower when they feel a special urge to smoke . Others have been helped by getting into exercises that make it difficult to smoke at the same time , such as swimming , running , or rowing . When stress is a problem , perhaps you could offer a neck rub to your parents or grandma or suggest another means of relaxation without the crutch of cigarettes . We have also had success in very difficult cases by sending the patient to a hypnotist/ psychiatrist who hypnotizes the patient . Believe it or not , we helped a Navy Admiral to quit smoking with nothing more than hypnotism . So Amber and Leigh , do n't give up ! Your grandma and parents will find something that will work.You are on the right track . Keep working at it One day they will thank you for having helped them quit !

I have another question . What is an ingrown toenail ? How is it formed ? I have one and it hurts ! I am a big fan and I read your section first ! // Jenna Marshalek Millstadt , Illinois Dear Jenna : Shots and needles are unfortunately necessary to prevent a lot of serious diseases and to sometimes give important medicines . When you do need a shot , as the shot is being given , try blowing hard , like you are blowing bubbles . Researchers have found that this blowing action makes shots less painful . It also seems to be helpful for other short periods of pain.You might try it the next time you bang your thumb or have a splinter removed . The good news is that research doctors are coming up with other ways to give medicines and vaccines than shots . The other good thing about shots is that you do n't need as many as you get older . Sometimes the nail of the big toe curves under at the sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause pain and infection . Ingrown toenails can be caused by wearing shoes that are too tight or by cutting the toenails incorrectly . Shoes should fit properly and allow enough room for toes to spread . Toenails should be cut straight across , not rounded like a half-moon.And do n't trim them too close . Nails should not be torn , but cut with a nail scissors or clippers. // People with ingrown toenails should wear open-toed sandals . The area should be kept clean and dry . Any signs of infection , such as redness , oozing of pus , and/or pain , should be checked by a doctor or a podiatrist ( foot doctor ) . He may recommend foot soaks , prescribe an antibiotic , or , only when necessary , recommend minor surgery.The pain you are having could be caused by an infection , so it would be wise to have your toe checked .
