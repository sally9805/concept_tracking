Section : THE Pastel PAGE <p> Alan Larkin is an associate professor of fine arts at Indiana University at South Bend . He received his B.A. degree from Carleton College in Northfield , Minnesota , and his M.F.A. from Pennsylvania State University in State College . He has been in numerous exhibitions and most recently received the Richard Ford Award and the Psi Iota Xi Award at the 76th Annual Hoosier Salon Exhibit at The Indiana State Museum in Indianapolis . In 1999 , he won Best of Show in the Annual Juried Fall Art Show of the Elkhart Art League , as well as the June Silver Award and the Juror 's Award in the 56th Annual Salon Show of the Northern Indiana Arts Association . His work is in many public and private collections , including those of The Indiana State Museum , The Oklahoma Art Center in Oklahoma City , and the Pillsbury Corporation in Minneapolis , Minnesota . <p> " My art is about beauty , not about ideas , " says pastelist Alan Larkin . Although he acknowledges that in some circles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their graceful lines and rich but subtle colors , testify to his statement that , for him , " making art is the pursuit of beauty . " <p> Classical mythology is an important source for the stories Larkin tells in his paintings . " There 's always something spiritual in Greek mythology , " he explains . " It recognizes the individuality of human beings and the importance of their emotional makeup . " <p> Larkin is able to present this individuality in his pastel paintings because , he says , " pastels are amazingly flexible tools , and you can continually rework the surface . The colors are pure and vibrant , and both hard and soft pastels have distinct characteristics , which creates a wide range of textures . " <p> Originally trained as a lithographer , the artist feels that the relationship between tool and surface is extremely important , and he chooses to work on museum-quality mat board . " One of my colleagues at Indiana University at South Bend insists that I 'm working on a material that nobody can use , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the difference . " <p> Larkin may do a preliminary drawing using either various pastels or black charcoal . " Sometimes black is faster , and so I 've been working with a monochromatic underdrawing lately , " he notes . " However , I recently finished a series of drawings that I started in color , using black for outlining . I use Prang black charcoal pencils and hold them way back on the shaft , which allows me to draw as if I were using brushes , producing lines that are long and free and strong . " <p> The artist builds up the painting using Rembrandt pastels or Nupastels and then adds finishing touches with saturated soft pastels such Unison or Sennelier . " When the drawing reaches a certain level of finish , I will almost always rub the surfaces of selected areas together and do the drawing all over again using fresh marks , " the artist notes . When he 's teaching this technique , he calls it " building a bed of chalk , " as a reference to plasterers whose next-to-last coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Larkin then sprays the work heavily in areas where he wants the image to darken or in portions that he wants to enliven with saturated chalk at the end , but he tries not to spray any areas where there are great subtleties of half tone . The artist may then draw another light layer of chalk over the top of a fixed layer . <p> " Familiarity with the tool is important in order to understand the full range of its capabilities , " he says . " For example , I know I can strip all the pastel off with tape or an eraser or fix it so it hardens like sandpaper and accepts additional . layers . Even soft applications of pastel can be manipulated to add new color . Having worked with pastels for so long , I feel very comfortable pushing them and pushing color in different directions . " <p> Although Larkin finds inspiration from mythology , he does n't plan his drawings beforehand . " I would say 90 percent of everything I do is directly from life , and I usually have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I allow the figure to transmute as I 'm working on it , and then all kinds of different things will happen , " he comments , using The Yellow Ball as an illustration . " I drew the model curled up in a fetal position , but I did n't like the result , so I had her lie in a completely different pose . I drew the bottom half of her from imagination , making her appear as though she were bending back . Then I assembled about four or five different sketches into one figure until eventually the negative shapes , the feelings , and the textures came together . In the end , I drew a figure catching a ball , but I had absolutely no intention of doing that . It just began to suggest itself . " <p> For Larkin , some pieces , such as The Poetry Students , are done in a week or two . Other times he sets a piece off to the side and returns to it again and again over several years . One of his most evolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took nearly two years to create . <p> Another piece , Drinking the New Spring Wine ( not shown ) , is a section of a much larger work . " I started this as a group of Bacchantes or Maenads , worshippers of the god Bacchus or Dionysus , " the artist explains . " I watched three-quarters of the drawing fail and one-quarter of it succeed , so eventually I cut the smaller portion out of the larger work . " <p> Not all Larkin 's works come from mythology . The Poetry Students , for example , was inspired by the work of Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema ( 1836-1912 ) , a Victorian painter . " I really love the azaleas and marble he uses in his pieces , " Larkin explains . " He had a wonderful sense of light and color , and his work has many tactile elements that I find extremely beautiful . " <p> The artist keeps his works in progress in his studio , the dining room of a building he owns in the historic district in South Bend , and stacks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has his easel and work space . After completion , the artist leaves a one-inch border of blank board around his pastels and then places them within a frame of his own design . Examples of his frames can be seen on his Web site : www.larkinstudio.com . <p> In his quest for beauty , teaching has given Larkin free time to pursue drawing and painting . " Teaching has enabled me to grow as an artist without having to take a beating from the marketplace , " he says . " It 's allowing my art to be a purely intellectual exercise , rather than something that is dictated by what the market will bear . Now I 've finally reached a point where people are buying my work more than ever , and it 's very gratifying . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Poetry Students , 1995 , pastel , 32 x 40 .
