Belle Vista Plantation <br> New Orleans , late August 1821 <p> " You wish to marry well ? By that , Jewell , you mean marry a wealthy man ? " Dorritt sat in her stepfather 's lavish ivory and gilded parlor , the heavy afternoon heat weighing her down . <p> " There can be no other meaning , sister . " Fanning herself , her younger half-sister took another promenade around the parlor . <p> Dorritt ignored her mother 's shocked disapproval . She sensed that today was the climax of months of planning by her stepfather . <p> Dorritt 's tambour frame and stand sat in front of her at hand level . Placing tiny artful stitches helped her conceal how her heart skipped and jumped . How would it all play out today ? Dorritt looked up at her half-sister , her opposite in everything , from Jewell 's olive skin and wavy blue-black hair to Dorritt 's fair skin and straight golden hair . " I believe love is necessary to marry well . " <p> Jewell made a sound of dismissal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These odd humors , your peculiar comments all come from books . You read too much , Dorritt . Father always says so and mother agrees . " <p> " Then it must be so . " The heat of the afternoon was squeezing Dorritt like a sodden tourniquet . She put down her needle and pinched the bridge of her nose . Over the past months , she had stood back and read the signs of her stepfather 's devious manipulation of facts and circumstances . Of course , Jewell had no idea that the culmination of these might come today . But Dorritt knew well what red ink in a ledger meant . <p> With a handkerchief , her mother blotted her rosy , perspiring face , which still retained a faded beauty . " Please , Jewell , you must sit down and relax ; compose yourself . " <p> " Why has n't AndrT come yet ? " Jewell attacked the lush Boston fern sitting on the stand by the French doors . She pulled off a frond and began stripping it . " He told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> There is many a slip between the cup and lip . " Perhaps he has been delayed . " Dorritt set another tiny stitch with rigid concentration . <p> Would her stepfather manage to work his trickery once more , bend reality to his selfish and greedy will ? And more important , could Dorritt use it in her favor ? Her hands stuttered and she had to pull the needle back out . <p> The sound of an approaching horse drew Jewell to the French doors that led to the garden . " I ca n't see the rider . He has already dismounted under the porte cochere . That does n't look like AndrT 's horse , " she added fretfully , and tossed the mangled frond back into the pot . <p> They all turned their heads to listen to the swishing of the grand front doors being parted , the murmur of their butler , the hum of another man 's voice , footsteps down the hallway to her stepfather 's den . If it was n't AndrT , who could it be ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a little skip . " Maybe I will receive two offers of marriage today . " <p> One proposal would achieve your doting father 's goal , dear sister . Dorritt took a deep breath and began an intricate French knot . <p> " Do you think it might really be Philippe Marchand ? " Their mother sounded awestruck . " Why he is worth nearly half a million . " <p> Jewell did a pirouette and swirled her hands in the air . " And I would be mistress of Marchand Plantation and eat blancmange every day . " <p> Dorritt imagined herself decorating her sister 's face with the white jellied dessert . She bent farther over her embroidery so neither her sister nor mother would see her unaccountable amusement . More of her odd humors . <p> " Come away from the window , Jewell , " her mother said in a low voice . " You must not appear as though you 're aware of any of this . " <p> For once , her younger half-sister obeyed . Jewell went and sat in the Chippendale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and moving the tambour frame in front of herself . <p> Their mother uttered a soft scold for Jewell 's theft . But Jewell ignored it as usual . <p> Dorritt stopped to blot her face with her hankie . She could only hope that AndrT had come to propose . If not AndrT , then Philippe . If Jewell were married , this might ring the first bell of freedom for her . <p> " Do n't you dare take one stitch , " Dorritt ordered in an undertone , holding her own nervousness in strict check . <p> " I embroider just as well as you do , " Jewell lied with a mocking smile . Her bitter chocolate eyes flashing , she boldly stuck the needle into the design . <p> Dorritt stood up . You need your face slapped , Jewell . But not by me . " I have work to do . " She strolled the length of the room , fanning herself with a woven palm fan . Glancing out the windows , she glimpsed the horse hitched in the shade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hall . Surely it was n't he who had come and gone into her stepfather 's den . Surely not . <p> Just as she reached the door of the room , she heard footsteps coming toward the parlor . It was what she feared . The widower who was pursuing her , Job Wilkinson , strode beside her step-father . Job looked like a white crane , and her stepfather waddled like a balding , plump self-satisfied gander . Not a good sign . The urge to flee nearly overcame her . But she composed herself , arranging her face into a sweet false smile . " Good day , Mr. Wilkinson . Wo n't you come in and I will order tea to be served . " She turned in time to see her sister 's flushed , irritated face . <p> If only Dorritt could have enjoyed this experience of for once flouting her sister 's conceit . But I thought I made myself clear . . . How like a man to ignore her stated wishes . <p> " No tea , " her stepfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . We will leave these two young people alone . " <p> Pouting , Jewell threw down the needle and rose . Their mother quickly led Jewell out . Her stepfather closed the pocket door to the parlor , and they were alone . <p> <br> Continues ...
