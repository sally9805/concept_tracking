<p> Tina Brown , the once highly conspicuous editor of Vanity Fair , The New Yorker and the short-lived Talk , has just written " The Diana Chronicles , " about the British princess who , like her , reigned as a golden girl over the transatlantic media world during the 1980s and ' 90s . <p> " I felt the book had to hit a standard or I 'd regret it , " Ms. Brown said over lunch the other day at the Beacon restaurant in Midtown . " It had to have some endurance , to enable me to make a quantum leap , to take me into a different area . " <p> And into the new century , which frankly has n't been so great for Ms. Brown 's career . Talk tanked . " Topic A With Tina Brown , " her little-seen show on CNBC , was canceled . For a time she wrote a column for The Washington Post . She contemplated a book about hubris , of all things . Now " The Diana Chronicles " ( Doubleday ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car crash in Paris , is Ms. Brown 's latest attempt to reinvent herself and seize the limelight . <p> At lunch she seemed a little nervous about that . She bristled at the idea that the book might be perceived as " just a gambit for reinvention rather than the passionate literary exercise that it was . " Life , she said " is a process of reinvention , of moving on . " She is returning with pleasure to her " roots as a writer , " she added . <p> She is , as she knows , an easy target . The culture of celebrity , over which she presided for years , has neither scruples nor sentiment , and a new book by her is an invitation for detractors to gloat over the passing of her time . So far the reviews have been positive . <p> Trim , blond , doe-eyed , like her subject , she wore at lunch a smart black T-shirt and skirt , not quite the taffeta " drop-dead black decollete number , " as she describes it in the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rack from a London designer 's studio in 1981 and wore on her first public date with Prince Charles . ( " Was n't that a mighty feast to set before a king ? " Lady Diana Cooper said about the " sudden revelation of cleavage . " ) <p> Comparing author with subject is inevitable , and not only thanks to the Di-like photo of the attractive 53-year-old Ms. Brown on the book 's back cover . She writes about a mix of monarchy , aristocracy and media : " a revisiting and valedictory of that whole world , which included my own early immersion in the London media , " she said . Princess Diana brought star power to British royalty , as Ms. Brown would also do within the more circumscribed but likewise clubby sphere of American editing . <p> The daughter of a British film producer and of Laurence Olivier 's former assistant , Ms. Brown arrived in New York in 1984 from London to save Vanity Fair . She had just resuscitated Tatler , the dowager magazine for the upper classes , whose transformation into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the princess 's public ascension . <p> " I felt an immediate bond with the Diana story , " she said . " Diana emerged blinking into the ' 80s just when I took over the Tatler . Tatler had started as the 18th-century coffeehouse magazine of Swift , and it got more and more staid , rather as The New Yorker did after Harold Ross , " its fouding editor . <p> " I 'd already done a lot of stories about society before I got to Tatler . And I 'd grown up in a showbiz background , the bookish daughter in the household . So I got it . " <p> By " it , " she meant the dawning media and celebrity culture in Britain . She remembers attending " the definitive end-of-decade social events of the ' 70s , " a 40th-birthday costume party for Nicky Haslam , the decorator , who dressed for the occasion in white silk like an Indian rajah , greeting guests like Cecil Beaton , Mick Jagger , Joan Collins and Camilla Parker Bowles 's brother , Mark Shand . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ms. Brown recalled , " and it crystallized the fact that society was no longer homogeneous . It was , I thought , what Tatler magazine should be . " <p> Eyeing high society now meant navel gazing too for the media mob that also joined in on the new aristocracy of celebrity . " The third story I did on Diana was about how she was being covered in the media . We saw something was happening that was as interesting as Di herself . " <p> What was happening , thanks to Diana 's media-exploiting instincts and looks , was the creation of the mythology of the People 's Princess . Years later at The New Yorker , Ms. Brown helped replace that mythology with a new mythology of grief . She recalls being awakened at 5 a.m. that August morning by a phone call from CNN . Within hours she conceived a Diana memorial issue and oversaw its publication three days later . Clive James , Salman Rushdie and Simon Schama wrote for it . On the cover a drawing showed a palace guard shedding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorker from the media frenzy , about which she 's critical in the book . " The death became a festival of inclusion , " Ms. Brown said . " It was the first great griefathon . Since then it 's become common  --  the pope , Terri Schiavo . I think a magazine has to mirror its times . The fever of a moment has to be captured . That Diana memorial cover was very effective . I still think it 's a very good issue . " <p> She added : " I 'm not the sort of person who would have bought a Diana book , but I read all the articles . I 'm writing this book for people who read the books but also for people like me . " <p> Some people , of course , loved what she did with The New Yorker ; others hated it . But the magazine became impossible to ignore . She chafes now at the suggestion that she blew the institution up so that her successor could put it back together after she left . " We let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a total blood transfusion . To me the biggest problem for The New Yorker was how to get people to open something that looks like a safari in print . The idea was always to provide a story that they would read . <p> " The sweet and the low , the long and the short , it 's somewhat what Harold Ross did . His New Yorker was very topical . I related less to Shawn 's New Yorker than to Ross 's . " William Shawn , Ross 's successor , ran the magazine from 1952 to 1987 . <p> When , to the surprise of everyone including S. I. Newhouse Jr. , chairman of Conde Nast , owner of The New Yorker , she quit the magazine in 1998 to start Talk , she had become such a public figure and media magnet that her resignation was front-page news in The New York Times . With Talk , and its book and movie divisions , she began a doomed partnership with Miramax , whose co-founder , Harvey Weinstein , also now happens to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bash on Liberty Island was the late ' 90s version of Mr. Haslam 's end-of-the- ' 70s affair . <p> Then Talk fizzled . Was she wrong to have left The New Yorker ? <p> " Oh yes , it was a big mistake , " said Ms. Brown , who has for years lived on the East Side with her husband , Harold Evans . ( They have two children . ) Like Diana , she recognizes candor as a form of self-defense . " I believe we put out a good magazine , " Ms. Brown continued , " It was that dot-com moment . I drank the Kool-Aid . I loved my idea of combining Paris Match and The New Yorker . And I loved that glossy paper we used . But it had to be a weekly , not a monthly . And advertisers had to be brought around . The time was n't there because the money was n't there . " <p> Talk editors soon found new jobs at The Times and elsewhere . Ms. Brown began her stint at CNBC . " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz-based show that exploited her dense Rolodex but never found the magic she showed before . " I liked everything except being on the air . And CNBC is a business channel . It was put on a Sunday night after a day of infomercials . Then again , I was a television novice . " <p> The Washington Post column kept her before the public . Meanwhile her hubris book was going to feature boldface crash-and-burn cases like Gerald Levin and Martha Stewart . " We 're living in an era of hubris , " Ms. Brown explained . " In the Bush era it 's all about overreach . But in the end I did n't want to write a book on a notional subject . It was n't engaging me enough . " <p> So she turned to writing this book about a celebrity whose iconic glamour harks back to a period that was also Ms. Brown 's heyday , not so long ago , but somehow far away . Di , who never shaved her head , went to jail or took off her underpants in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The panache , gloss , savvy and grace that Ms. Brown tried to bring to highbrow celebrity journalism has been marginalized too , by a growing avalanche of more tabloidlike coverage . <p> " The temperature has shifted , " Ms. Brown declared . " Now everybody 's famous and nobody 's interesting . Any celebrity will do . " Tabloids have become " fabloids , " she said . And bloggers are watching . With the Web , " you worry about saying something to somebody in Germany and finding it reverberate around the world . Now you 're supposed to love any publicity just because it 's great buzz and not mind whether it 's fair or true , says the erstwhile queen of buzz , " said the erstwhile queen herself . <p> " Yes , " she added , answering a question not asked , " it 's nicer to be on the other side . " <p> Was it also true , by the way , that she recently expressed her interest in the job of managing editor at Time ? The post went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good job with that , " she replied . " It has great DNA . " <p> But it 's not a good time to start up new magazines , she said . Editors today " are a dying breed , " she added . " It 's all not about the content . In TV it 's only about logistics , ratings . It 's a very depressing moment in letters . <p> " Writing a book is one of the last chances to do what you want . " <p> #
