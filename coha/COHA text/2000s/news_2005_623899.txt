<p> Rarely in recent memory has a political debate turned on such diametrically opposed claims about the factual record . <p> As the Bush administration and war critics , most of them Democrats , are engaged in a slashing battle of words over the conflict in Iraq , what the president and his advisers knew and when they knew it have become a domestic second front . In the past week , this verbal battlefield consumed the House of Representatives and stretched across the Pacific to Asia , where President Bush on Saturday delivered his third major defense of his Iraq policies in nine days . <p> Here is a review of the factual basis for some of the White House and Democratic claims : <p> Weapons intelligence <p> Claim : Democrats and war critics have long claimed that the administration manipulated intelligence about Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction . In his Veterans Day speech this month , Bush in rebuttal said Democratic leaders " are fully aware that a bipartisan Senate investigation found no evidence of political pressure to change the intelligence community 's judgments related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the administration 's prewar claims have proved to be false or misleading . Reports by the Senate Intelligence Committee , released in July 2004 , and the Silberman-Robb Commission , released in March , came to no firm conclusions about who was at fault , generally blaming the fiasco on sloppy work by CIA analysts . However , neither report attempted to interpret how the administration had used the intelligence or whether it had ignored dissenting views . <p> This gap caused a major fight on the Senate floor earlier this month , when Democrats complained that the GOP leadership of the Intelligence Committee had quashed a section of the probe that was to cover the administration 's prewar use of intelligence on Iraq . Committee Chairman Pat Roberts , R-Kan. , finally relented and allowed this second phase to continue ; results are not expected to be completed until late next year . <p> So far , there has been no official attempt to assess why Vice President Dick Cheney , during the run-up to the war , continually made dramatic assertions that  --  it is now known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , he repeatedly claimed that the Sept. 11 ringleader Mohammed Atta had met with Iraqi government agents not long before the terrorist attacks , that Iraq had mobile biological weapons laboratories and that Iraq was harboring and training al Qaeda terrorists  --  claims that had been questioned in numerous CIA memos and later turned out to be false . <p> The administration 's inaccurate claim that Iraq was trying to import yellowcake uranium from Niger has blossomed into a legal nightmare for the administration , as Justice Department special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald has indicted Cheney 's chief of staff , Lewis " Scooter " Libby , for perjury , obstruction of justice and making false statements . More indictments are possible . <p> Who knew what ? Claim : The White House has accused Democratic leaders of hypocrisy , saying they had also believed Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction . On Wednesday , Cheney said , " There was broad-based bipartisan agreement that Saddam Hussein was a threat ... that he violated U.N . Security Council resolutions and that , in a post-9/11 world , we could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a history of ( weapons of mass destruction ) programs , who had excluded weapons inspectors ... who had committed mass murder . Those are the facts . " <p> Facts : The White House version is largely correct . Most Democratic leaders do n't like to admit it now , but they roundly supported the prewar conventional wisdom that Hussein had chemical and biological weapons and an active nuclear program . From former President Bill Clinton to former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to Sen. Hillary Clinton , D-N.Y. , to 2004 presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry , D-Mass. , the consensus was overwhelming  --  Iraq had weapons of mass destruction . <p> The chorus about Iraq 's weaponry was reinforced by the vast majority of think-tank analysts . <p> " The consensus of the intelligence community was probably the most important factor " in the unanimity about Iraq 's possession of weapons , said Kenneth Pollack of the Brookings Institution in Washington , who was an influential voice in the prewar debate . " I was listening to the intelligence analysts . More the fool me , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Claim : The White House says the October 2002 war-powers resolution passed by the House and Senate was essentially a vote on whether to invade Iraq . Democrats say it was merely a vote to give the president increased leverage over Hussein in jockeying over U.N . weapons inspections . <p> Facts : The White House version is correct . At the time of the vote , it was widely understood that the vote was about whether to invade Iraq . <p> But from the perspective of the tiny handful of experts who dissented from the conventional wisdom about Iraq 's weapons , both Republicans and Democrats are to blame . <p> " The White House was n't misleading Congress because Congress was playing the game , " said Scott Ritter , the chief U.N . weapons inspector in Iraq from 1991 through 1998 . Ritter was derided by many commentators for his claims in the prewar debate that Iraq did not have any banned weapons . <p> " It was politically expedient for all , " he said . " The problem is that no politician , Republican or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth about Iraq , because that would ... not only fly in the face of the American policy of ' regime change , ' but also damage them politically because people would say : ' You 're supportive of Saddam . ' Everybody fell right in line and said : ' Yes , Saddam is a threat , ' when they knew there was no information out there to sustain this information . " <p> The same intelligence ? <p> Claim : Democrats had access to the same intelligence about Iraqi weapons that the White House saw . <p> Facts : The White House version is only partly true . The Democrats had access to final CIA reports assessing Iraqi weapons , but they did not have access to dissenting reports from mid-level intelligence officials that cast cold water on erroneous or exaggerated claims . <p> Democratic leaders " did n't have the same intelligence by any means , and a lot of these guys look at the press because they have no ability to get classified information , " said David Albright , a former U.N . weapons inspector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Security in Washington . <p> " What the administration did was spin up the information , " Albright said . " The White House made it look like ( an Iraqi attack with weapons of mass destruction ) could happen anytime . ... There was the CIA making mistakes , hyping stuff up , suppressing dissent , belittling dissent ; you had the White House exaggerating what the CIA was saying ; and you had Kay exaggerating even what the White House was saying , " Albright said , referring to former U.N . inspector David Kay , who before the Iraq invasion was a strident pro-war commentator . After the war , Kay headed a CIA team in Iraq searching for the weapons and  --  when he found none  --  became an equally strident Bush critic . <p> Foreign intelligence <p> Claim : In his Nov. 11 speech , Bush said that the Democrats " also know that intelligence agencies from around the world agreed with our assessment of Saddam Hussein . They know the United Nations passed more than a dozen resolutions citing his development and possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only major Western intelligence agencies that agreed fully with the Bush administration 's stance on Iraqi weapons were the British and the Germans . In France , President Jacques Chirac and Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin publicly stated that although there was evidence suggesting the possibility of banned activity by Iraq , there was no solid proof that such weapons existed . U.N . weapons inspectors led by Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei reported that Iraq had failed to cooperate fully with their inspections teams and that major questions remained about Iraqi weapons , but they also said clearly that there was no irrefutable evidence of active weapons programs . <p> The Iraq resolutions passed by the U.N . Security Council did not say that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction . Instead , the council members condemned Hussein 's failure to abide by U.N . resolutions ordering Iraq to allow inspectors full access for their searches . President Bush told U.S. soldiers in South Korea that there would be no early troop withdrawal from Iraq because " sober judgment " must prevail over emotions . / Charles Dharaspak / Associated @
