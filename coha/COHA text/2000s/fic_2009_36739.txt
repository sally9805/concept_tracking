<p> GeorgeTown  --  Monday Early Morning <p> <p> " All nonessential White House employees remain home due to ice storm . Update in four hours . " <p> <p> Samantha Reid stared at the e-mail and pushed a strand of her long brown hair back off her forehead . She knew that most everyone would try to show up for work today because nobody wanted to be thought of as " nonessential . " At least she had a four- wheel- drive jeep she 'd been driving for years . Not the most chic car that regularly parked on West Exec , the driveway separating the West Wing from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building  --  or EEOB , as they all called the big Empire place that housed most of the staff  --  but it was a car she 'd bought near her parents ' home in Texas , where everybody drives jeeps . <p> <p> She glanced out the picture window of her tiny Georgetown apartment overlooking the Whitehurst Freeway . Just beyond was a narrow park lining the Potomac River , its trees weighted down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silhouetted in the dim predawn light where a lone taxi , trying to navigate the icy roadway , suddenly spun out and slammed into a guardrail . <p> <p> Good Lord , she thought . It may look like a scene out of Swan Lake , but it really is treacherous out there . She had known a front was moving in , but an ice storm in early December did n't happen all that often and nobody had predicted it would be this bad . <p> <p> She looked down at her computer again . She always checked her e-mail when she first woke up , as she often got urgent messages from her boss , the head of the White House Office of Homeland Security . They had been working practically round the clock on a whole list of issues and new safety measures , coordinating with the agencies , following up on tips and executing Presidential orders . She had stayed late last night summarizing the fallout from a threat to a big shopping center made the day after Thanksgiving . Thankfully , that one turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be focusing on other problems , including a new missile defense system they were trying to get deployed on a number of commercial airplanes . She checked her schedule and remembered that a group of airline executives were due for an 11:00 a.m. meeting in the Roosevelt Room . The mastermind of a new 360- degree laser defense , Dr. Cameron Talbot , was supposed to join the airline officers . But now , with the storm raging , she doubted if any of them would make it in . <p> <p> She also had a meeting to follow up on an attack on the Metro . Transit cops had nailed a guy trying to leave a backpack filled with explosives on board a D.C. train headed for the Pentagon . When the Metro was built , some genius had designed a stop directly underneath the building . What were they thinking ? <p> <p> She shoved her computer aside and padded into the tiny galley kitchen . It looked like it could have fit into a train , with shallow cabinets on two walls , sparse counter space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her whole condo was less than four hundred square feet , but she had gladly exchanged size for the convenience of a Georgetown address that put her within minutes of the White House , though this morning , inching along the icy Washington streets , she 'd be lucky if she 'd make it in an hour 's time . <p> <p> She flicked on the small TV set that took up way too much space on the kitchen counter and heard a commercial advertising a new drug . There were pictures of a kindly- looking grandmother pushing a laughing child on a swing while the announcer said in the tone of an afterthought , " Side effects could include dizziness , nausea , muscle weakness , weight gain , and , in rare cases , temporary loss of vision , coma , or stroke . " She shook her head at the absurdity of it all , but then heard the news anchor come back on with the weather report . His map showed a wide swath of storms , snow , and ice reaching from Oklahoma all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge . <p> <p> She measured the coffee , stuck an English muffin into the toaster , and checked her watch . She 'd have to skip her morning workout in the basement fitness center . With the added commute time , maybe they 'd delay their usual early- morning staff meeting , but she could n't take that chance . As she reached for a coffee mug , she made a mental note to remind her boss about his appearance on CNN at noon to discuss the Metro train arrest and the shopping center situation . She knew she 'd have to write his talking points , but wondered what other potential disaster would have to be added at the last minute . <p> <p> Excerpted from Final Finesse by Karna Small Bodman .
