<p> ASK CHRONICLE READERS to name one feature of the paper they would like to see more of , and the instant answer almost always is the same : local news . <p> Then the trouble begins . <p> For the plain fact is that trying to define precisely what our readers  --  highly educated and highly involved in their communities  --  mean when they say " local news " is a question of near-Talmudic proportion . <p> For some readers , local news simply means intensive coverage of their own particular school board , supervisors or snarled commute . For some , it means examining regional issues like education , health care or development in ways that resonate in every community throughout the Bay Area . Others think The Chronicle 's prime local news mission is to provide them in-depth coverage of San Francisco . Still others say it means interpreting events from Sacramento , Washington or around the world from a sharply local perspective . <p> For us , balancing these sometimes conflicting demands and definitions has been an overriding concern in recent years , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local news report . <p> At a time of intense competition in the media industry , our two-part challenge is to fulfill our mission as the Bay Area 's major regional paper  --  with the scope and reach of the best writing , photography , breaking news and enterprise reporting  --  at the same time as we improve our performance in covering local issues in your backyard . <p> Since 1997 , we have hired dozens of new staff members and added many columns of news space , all devoted to coverage that homes in more closely on your city , county and community . At the same time , we have beefed up our region-wide report , already the most far-flung of any Bay Area paper , while adding more staff and space for business , entertainment and sports , plus national and international reporting projects . <p> As a regional paper , we circulate over a huge area of Northern California , from the Oregon border to Fresno . Three-fourths of our readers live outside of San Francisco , concentrated in a metropolitan area the size of New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , San Mateo , Santa Clara , Solano and Sonoma counties , in addition to the city . <p> Within that region are millions of people , more than 100 cities and towns , plus hundreds of school districts , hospitals , Little League teams , little theaters and little human dramas , not to mention uncounted landmarks commissions , leaf-blower disputes , mosquito abatement districts , police agencies and waste management boards . <p> It 's all the stuff of local news to someone . But what is of burning interest to readers in San Anselmo may be decidely less so to those in San Bruno . At the same time , a " local " school story from Millbrae may echo with importance for all our readers . <p> Our job is to find , break and report both kinds of stories , and then to apply good news judgment in crafting a daily menu of local and regional coverage that suits the specific needs of readers in different geographic corners of our market . <p> It is a problem we have worked on intensively for the past several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make improvements . Within the last month , for example , we 've added 11 staff positions for local news , and started two new local sections . <p> We 've attacked the problem in two key ways : local zoned editions and " Friday " sections . <p> Our most important tool is The Chronicle 's daily local and regional news section , which runs directly behind main news . To be accurate , this section is actually produced as five separate sections , six days a week , each containing a different mix of stories , photographs , graphics , columns , briefs and even sometimes advertising . Each is targeted and delivered to a different " zone " within our overall circulation area . <p> The paper 's local news section has different names for different zones : <p>  --  " East Bay " for an edition that goes to the East Bay shoreline from Alameda through Contra Costa counties . <p>  --  " Contra Costa " for an edition that goes to Contra Costa and Solano counties and the Tri-Valley area . <p>  --  " Peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Clara counties . <p>  --  " San Francisco " for an edition that goes to the city and small parts of northern San Mateo county . <p>  --  " Bay Area " for an edition that goes primarily to Marin , Sonoma and other North Bay counties . <p> Each day , each of the local news sections contains a customized mix of stories that are of interest primarily in that geographic area , plus the best of our regional report . Many are simply local stories that " travel , " and that we believe will be of interest to readers , regardless of where they live . <p> Two examples of these kind of stories are our " Classroom Chronicles , " an ongoing series produced by our team of education writers , based throughout the region , and " Commuter Chronicles , " written by our team of transportation reporters , also writing from around the bay . <p> Since 1997 , we have greatly expanded our zoning of local news , adding more than 30 reporters , editors , photographers and graphic artists devoted exclusively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expansion . <p> Although you know many of these journalists from their bylines in the paper , the unsung heroes and heroines of our expanded local coverage are in two key groups . One is our team of outstanding bureau chiefs , who assign and lead our local coverage  --  Trapper Byrne in San Francisco , Michael Collier in Oakland , Jeanne Cooper on the Peninsula , Paul Feist in Walnut Creek and regional editor Tyra Mead , who directs reporting in the North Bay . <p> The second group is our team of local news and copy editors , including Heather Jones , Eric Lindemulder , Marcel Pacatte , Rich Pestorich and Wanda Ravernell . They literally assemble different local editions each night , working under extreme deadline pressure and using seasoned editorial craft and judgment to bring order to each day 's Byzantine collection of words and images from around the region . <p> In addition to this daily zoning , we also produce five once-a-week " Friday " sections , matching the daily local editions , including a new " San Francisco Friday " section we launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the dailies , are purely local and carry columns , news features , plus coverage of local sports , arts and dining , along with in-depth listings of activities . They are also zoned for advertising . <p> Producing this kind of content is labor intensive , and the key behind-the-scenes player is Deborah Brown , an indefatigable veteran editor whose staff each week churns out more than 40 pages of very local copy from all around the Bay Area . <p> Since we began our " Friday " section project several years ago , these sections have proven very popular with readers , who tell us they appreciate the level of " localness " we can offer in them that we can not in the daily paper . Even before launch of " San Francisco Friday , " our survey research showed the sections were the fourth best-read section each week , trailing only Main News , daily Local News and Datebook . <p> That , to us , is just more evidence that the importance of local content to The Chronicle can not be overemphasized  --  and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our local news initiatives continue to expand in the months and years to come . <p> HOW THE CHRONICLE COVERS LOCAL NEWS <p> This graphic shows The Chronicle 's five daily local news sections , which are " zoned " to present the strongest mix of very local and regional coverage in each part of our circulation area . <p> Key elements of each local news section include : <p> 1 ) Local zones . The Chronicle 's core circulation area is as big as several New England states . To deliver very local stories , along with the best of our regional report , we divide our local report into five separate editions . <p> 2 ) Centerpiece . Often a feature story , but sometimes a breaking news story , centerpieces seek to combine human interest and strong visual images . Centerpieces most often are " zoned " for each section , but can also be regional stories that run in all zones . <p> 3 ) Columnists . Our four local news columnists bring a familiar voice and intense knowledge of community people and issues to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's column runs in Contra Costa , Chip Johnson 's in the East Bay , Mark Simon 's on the Peninsula and Ken Garcia 's in the San Francisco and Bay Area sections . <p> 4 ) Inside . The Chronicle recently added more space on inside pages for more local news . <p> 5 ) Regional . While increasing the amount of local coverage tailored for each zone , we also continue to deliver the best of regional news from around the Bay Area .
