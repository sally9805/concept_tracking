Walt Booth was feeling lonely . He 'd been widowed over five years ago when his kids were twenty-six and fourteen . Now that he was sixty-two , the kids were on their own . Vanessa was married to Paul and they lived on the property on the other side of the stable , and Tom had nearly completed his first year at West Point . Walt 's niece , Shelby , had been staying with him , but during the February freeze she had left to vacation in Maui before pursuing her education in San Francisco . But that only scratched the surface . He 'd recently begun a relationship with his neighbor , a beautiful , vivacious , mischievous movie star just a few years younger than he was . Muriel St. Claire . Their liaison was just getting interesting , just heating up , when she was lured back to Hollywood to make another film . He was left with her two Labrador retrievers and her two horses . He 'd had one phone call since she 'd departed for L.A. via private jet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a party . There was music , chatter , laughter , the clinking of glasses , and Muriel sounded on top of the world . <p> The truth of the matter was , he 'd gone and fallen in love with her . She had trapped him by being nothing like his perception of a movie star . She 'd come to Virgin River almost a year ago , moved into an old farmhouse with her animals and restored it , almost entirely by herself . He 'd never seen her in anything but slacks , usually jeans and boots , often painter 's overalls . She was a crackerjack horsewoman , an expert shot and was training her own bird dogs for hunting waterfowl . Earthy . Basic . Yet her wit was sophisticated and her beauty natural and unforgettable . And right now , while he sat by the window in his great room , scratching her dog behind the ear , she was making a movie with Jack Nicholson . The truth ? He wondered if she 'd come back . <p> His doorbell rang and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd felt like a sixteen-year-old boy , looking forward to seeing Muriel every day . Today he felt old and short on time . <p> He opened the door to Luke Riordan and frowned . This was just about the last person he 'd like to see right now . Luke and Shelby had had a romance that did n't work out , which Walt suspected was her reason for leaving . <p> " Morning , General , " Luke said with a slight nod . " Got a minute ? " <p> " I guess , " he said , standing back from the door . " Coffee ? " <p> " No thanks , sir , " Luke said , stepping into the house . " It 's just that  --  Well , I owe you an apology . " <p> " That so ? " Walt asked . He turned and walked back into the great room . The dogs spied Luke and immediately put the rush on him . Luce , the chocolate Lab , sat in front of him politely , but her tail wagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Buff , less than a year old , lost all control and just barreled into him , jumping up and head butting for attention . " Buff ! Down ! " Walt admonished . It did n't do much good . The yellow Lab was pretty much out of control where visitors were concerned . <p> " Whoa , " Luke laughed , grabbing the Lab behind the ears and sitting him down . " Got yourself some company here ? " <p> " These are Muriel 's dogs . She 's out of town and I 'm taking care of them . " <p> " Out of town ? " Luke asked , straightening . <p> Walt sat in his chair and clicked the dogs back to his side by snapping his fingers . He did n't volunteer any more information about Muriel 's whereabouts . With a Lab on each side of him , he indicated the chair facing his . " Take a seat , Riordan . I 'm anxious to hear about this apology . " <p> Luke took his seat uneasily . " General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little over two weeks ago . I apologize , sir . She had every reason to think her future was n't secure with me and she left . " <p> Walt settled back . Shelby was twenty-five to Luke 's thirty-eight and Walt had been concerned that his niece 's involvement with this tough-edged Blackhawk pilot might end with her being hurt . " How does that not surprise me ? " Walt said churlishly . <p> " I let her go , sir . I thought she might be better off . <p> I hated to think she 'd bet everything on someone like me . " <p> Walt smirked . He could n't have put it better himself . " I should 've just shot you , " he said . " I gave it serious thought . " <p> Luke could n't suppress a huff of silent laughter . " I figured you did . Sir . " Luke had n't been out of the army quite long enough to relax about that rank thing . The general was a general till he died and was accorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bitch and threatened Luke 's life . <p> " You should be apologizing to her , not me , " Walt said . <p> " I 've taken care of that , sir . Unbelievably , I 'm forgiven . " <p> " You talked to her ? " <p> " Yes , sir . She came back . She was pissed as hell , but I threw myself on her mercy and she 's given me another chance . I plan to do better this time . " <p> Walt 's eyes had grown wide and his bushy black eyebrows shot up high . " She 's back ? " <p> " Yes , sir . She said to tell you she 'd be right over . She had something to take care of and I wanted a word with you first . " <p> " To apologize , " Walt groused . " I 'd like to see my niece , if you do n't mind . " <p> " She 'll be here pretty soon . But there 's another thing . I 'd like your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Walt ground his teeth . " You 're really pressing your luck . " <p> " Oh , you do n't know the half . " Luke chuckled before he could stop himself . " Almost thirty-nine years old and I 'm buying into the whole program . It 's not even one of her conditions  --  it 's one of mine . General Booth , she 's everything to me . I ca n't live without her . I thought I could and I tried , but it 's too late for me . I 'm in love with Shelby . I 'm going to be in love with her for the rest of my life . " <p> Walt was sitting straighter . He moved to the edge of his chair . " What about her education ? What about a family ? I think my niece wants a family and I heard you say that was n't  --  " <p> " You probably heard me say a lot of things I thought I meant and did n't , sir . Shelby can have anything she wants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to waste her time , sir . If she 'll marry me , I 'll give her everything I have , go anywhere she needs me to go . She wo n't ever again leave my house thinking I do n't care about her . That could have been the biggest mistake of my lifetime . " <p> Walt smiled in spite of himself . " Learned your lesson , did you , boy ? " <p> Luke did n't mind so much being called a boy by this military icon , but the truth hit him pretty hard . " Oh , man , " he said , shaking his head . " You have no idea . " <p> Walt leaned back . " I like seeing you humbled a little bit , Riordan . What if I withhold my permission ? " <p> " Oh , I 'll ask her anyway . I 'll tell her you disapprove and ask her to overlook that . But I 'd like to do this right , sir . I 've made enough mistakes  --  I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hmm , " Walt hummed . " I guess I can still be surprised . " <p> " Sir ? " <p> " I did n't figure you for intelligence . " <p> Luke just shook his head . Well , this was no less than he deserved . He 'd taken the general 's niece into his bed , telling her he just was n't the kind of man who could settle down . He used every rationalization he could think of to make that all right , but he knew all along that was going to be real tough for the general to swallow . He also knew if Shelby were his niece , he would n't have stood for it . Now Walt was obviously going to torture him for a while . Luke supposed it was his just due . <p> The front door opened and Shelby breezed in . Both men shot to their feet , but Luke got to her first , slipping an arm around her waist . " Take care of everything ? " he asked quietly . <p> " Uh-huh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got off easy . " Shelby had left Virgin River without saying goodbye to Luke 's helper , Art . That in itself was n't such a crime , but Art was a thirty-year-old man with Down syndrome and things like disappearing without an explanation or goodbye could seem like abandonment to him . " He was n't angry with me  --  just worried . " <p> Then she went to her uncle . " I 'm sorry I did n't call and let you know I was coming back , Uncle Walt . I had business to take care of with Luke first . " <p> Walt looked at her beautiful , shining face . Her hazel eyes glowed , her cheeks were flush with love . But looking at Shelby was n't the startling part . One look at Luke told the rest of the story . Luke had always had that bad-boy edge , an aura of danger and a short fuse . <p> No more . All the rough edges had been ground down and his expression was docile as a puppy . <p> Walt just laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fiercely . " Shelby , Shelby , " he said . He held her away from him and , grinning , he said , " Looks like you 've tamed him . He does n't have any fight left in him . " <p> " Thank God , " she said . " I do n't think I could take much more . He 's been a real handful . But Luke still needs a little work , so I 'm going to be staying with him now . I 'll be over to help you with the horses every day , just like always . " <p> " That would be nice , honey , " he said . " There are a lot of horses . Muriel 's out of town and I 've got the dogs and horses . " <p> Shelby reached down and gave each Lab a little scratch . " Where is she ? " <p> " She 's gone back to Hollywood for a while . Going to make a movie . " <p> " Really ? " Shelby asked , grinning hugely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome . " <p> She would find that exciting news , Walt thought . He had told Muriel she had his devoted support in achieving everything her heart desired , but in fact he was n't feeling real supportive . He was feeling jealous and lonely and out of sorts . And this news about Shelby and Luke just added to his misery . <p> He shook it off . " Luke ? " he asked , looking at the man . When he had Luke 's attention , Walt gave his chin a firm nod . And that was all it took to make Luke Riordan 's eyes light up as though beacons shone from within. *** <p> At 1:00 a.m. the phone rang next to Walt 's bed . He thought first of Shelby ; she 'd thrown her lot in with Luke and Walt hoped nothing had gone wrong . He thought next of Vanessa , Paul and little Matt , his grandson . Young Tom crossed his mind  --  but a middle-of-the-night phone call from West Point was highly unlikely . <p> " Walt ? " came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say hello . " Darling , I 'm sorry  --  I know what time it is . " <p> Darling ? Did she call him darling ? Oh , those Hollywood types probably called everyone darling . " It 's all right , " he said sleepily . " Are you okay ? " <p> " Oh , I 'm okay . This is honestly the first chance I 've had to call in days . But it 's not going to stay this crazy . I hope . " <p> " What 's going on ? " <p> " Well , everything . The production company has been staging small parties in key places all over town , trying to create some preproduction buzz about the movie by having cast members show up . I 've been researching the character , spending some time with the writer , rehearsing lines they 'll only rewrite the second I have them down , looking at wardrobe and set sketches with the production designer , and generally going out to lunch , drinks , dinner , drinks , and talking till midnight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman till 5:00 a.m. when I get up and jump on the treadmill . " <p> He just shook his head in confusion . " What 's the treadmill got to do with anything ? " <p> She laughed . " I have to be in good shape . And I do n't have the dogs or horses to help me do that . I hired my old trainer back to firm things up a bit . I know it does n't sound like it , but I 'm working my ass off . " <p> " Well , stop going out for all those drinks and you 'll feel better . " <p> " I stick to club soda when I 'm meeting with actors , producers , promoters , et cetera . They 're not catching me with my pants down . " <p> He smiled and felt instant shame for having baited her like that . And pride ; she was a consummate professional  --  he should have known that . " That 's my girl . " <p> " Tell me what 's going on there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Silence answered him . " She did ? " Muriel finally asked in a shocked breath . <p> " Yes , ma'am . And apparently Luke did enough groveling to satisfy her , because she 's moved in with him . And this morning he paid me a visit , asked my permission to propose . " <p> " Get out of town ! Did you grant it ? " <p> " No . I told him to go to hell . I should have just shot him . I told him that . " <p> " Oh , you 'd like me to believe you 're that kind of bully , would n't you ? " <p> " The silly girl seems to love him . And you should see him . Whipped into shape that fast . I bet if we pulled up his shirt , there would be lash marks all over his back . He 's limp as a noodle . " <p> " I bet he 's not , " she said with a laugh . " Well , good for Shelby . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the night , they just said , ' Okay , bah-bye . ' " <p> " What 's Jack Whatshisname like ? " <p> " Are you ever going to say his last name ? " she asked with a deep sigh . <p> " No . " <p> " He 's a nice man . Professional , punctual , talented , and very much enjoys the way people fall at his feet . And they should . He 's got the gift . I like him . I think working with him again will be a good experience . " <p> " Muriel , " he said softly , " when are you coming home ? " <p> Equally soft , she answered , " I do n't know , Walt . And yes , I miss you . " <p> Jack 's bar was the place in Virgin River where the locals gathered . Not that everyone was there every night , but you could always count on seeing a friend there . There was a military backbone to this community since Jack Sheridan , a Marine who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following him to the town was one of his best friends , John Middleton , known as Preacher , who was his partner and the cook at the bar . Next to arrive was Mike Valenzuela who 'd served with Jack in Iraq twice and was now the town constable . Walt 's son-in-law , Paul , was one of Jack 's boys from way back and had also served with him twice . Even Luke Riordan , being ex-army , was welcomed into this brotherhood . It was the kind of place Walt felt he belonged . <br> Continues ...
