Is the religious right compromising your health care ? * BY EMILY BASS // JUST SIX MONTHS AFTER THE SUPREME COURT DECIDed Roe v. Wade in 1973 , Congress enacted the Church Amendment . Largely unnoticed , the statute exempted individuals and institutions with religious or moral objections from performing abortions or sterilizations , even though they were receiving federal funds . By 1978 , nearly every state had passed its own version of the amendment , in many cases expanding the scope of the exemptions . To the extent that these laws protected individual rights , they seemed reasonable enough to most pro-choice advocates ; after all , the abortion debate had been waged on the battlegrounds of conscience and the rights of women to make their own decisions . It seemed fair to take into account the personal choice of the providers being asked to perform abortions . In an era when private doctors were the norm , this rationale made sense . But these laws also covered hospitals and clinics , and so pitted an abstract notion of institutional conscience against a woman 's individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shadowy realm of conscience , the basic medical principle of full disclosure did not apply to everyone-in most states with these laws , providers were not required to publicly post their " conscientious objections . " Fast-forward to the present ; the Church Amendment and its state progeny have spawned a new generation of exemptions , and they go even further than the originals . " Noncompliance clauses " ( called " conscience clauses " by the religious right ) began showing up in state legislatures in the early 1990s , not coincidentally at the same time that Bill Clinton 's proposed health care reform bill was being debated . While they vary in specifics , the clauses allow religiously affiliated hospitals , employers , insurers , HMOs , or individual doctors to opt out , not only from performing abortions and sterilizations , but , in some cases , even from discussing abortions . They can also allow providers to refuse to offer , pay for , or talk about contraception . As with their predecessors , most of these clauses offer a veil of secrecy : providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By protecting a health care provider 's right to refuse specific services , and giving this right precedence over a woman 's right to make informed decisions about her health , noncompliance clauses create a parallel medical universe where professional obligations can be altered by personal beliefs . Like other feminist struggles , this debate is , in part , a war of words . " Conscience clause " is a righteous , halo  --  wearing turn of phrase that puts a positive spin on legally sanctioned denial of standard health care ; and that 's the term you 'll see used in the mainstream media . " What we need to stress is whose conscience is going to be respected , " says Frances Kissling , president of Catholics for a Free Choice . " Are we willing to respect the conscience of an institution above that of an individual ? " Various organizations , including the ACLU , the ProChoice Resource Center , Planned Parenthood , NARAL , and Catholics for a Free Choice , are referring to them more accurately as noncompliance clauses , " religious loopholes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groundwork for a range of chilling scenarios : a woman seeking an abortion leaves her doctor 's office with a pamphlet on prenatal care , a handful of vitamins , and no referral to an abortion provider . A woman and her husband filling his-'n ' - hers prescriptions for Viagra and Ortho Tri-Cyclen find that his are completely covered by insurance , while she has to fork over the entire cost of the Pill . A woman who has traveled a hundred miles to give birth to her sixth child in a rural hospital is refused the safe , simple procedure of having her tubes tied at the same time . And in a Catholic emergency room , a rape survivor is refused emergency contraception ( EC ) - if she knows to ask for it . If she does n't , she will leave without learning that the option exists at all . Even if that survivor does get a referral , or a prescription for EC , she could then find that her local pharmacist refuses to fill it on the grounds of conscience . In each instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or pharmacist-is favored over the woman . AN INDEX OF PROGRESS ? Most noncompliance clauses are created by the conservative lobby and inserted into progressive state legislation . Just as Clinton 's health care reform bill inspired such preemptive clauses in the early nineties , another push happened after Viagra was approved in 1998 . For years , women 's health advocates had been trying to introduce at the state level Equity in Prescription Insurance Coverage ( EPICC ) bills , which would require private insurers to pay for oral contraceptives . So when the FDA approved the miracle impotence drug  --  and many insurers quickly moved to cover the cost-women pointed out the hypocrisy and inherent sexism in covering Viagra and not the Pill . Their outcry helped put EPICC bills on the legislative agenda of nearly every state . With the EPICC bills , however , came more noncompliance clauses . And with each new effort , the rightwing lobby extends its reach . Take the Women 's Health and Wellness Act , which was being debated in New York at press time . The bill would require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as services like screening for cervical and breast cancer , and drugs for osteoporosis . But conservatives lobbied to exempt religious employers from insuring a range of birth control options  --  and got a boost from New York 's Cardinal Edward Egan ( see page 43 ) . Pair the Church 's political muscle with a tremendous increase in Catholic hospitals taking over secular institutions-there were approximately one hundred forty mergers between 1995 and 2000-and the result is frightening . In half of all religious hospital mergers from 1990 to 1998 , reproductive health services were eliminated . The Catholic health care system is the largest nonprofit health care delivery system in the country , " serving " about 70 million patients each year . Many women are finding themselves in a situation where an entire network  --  hundreds of doctors-has opted out of offering comprehensive care , making it virtually impossible for them to switch to another doctor or clinic . The fact is , most women are likely to be affected by noncompliance clauses , whether or not they use Catholic health services . Nearly every state in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse over your right to health services . " This is about quality access to health care for pluralistic communities where public resources are getting scarcer and scarcer , " says Lourdes Rivera , an attorney with the National Health Law Program . And while state legislatures accept ever-broader noncompliance clauses , the federal government is bending over backward to protect Catholic interests by accommodating Catholic HMOs competing for Medicaid and Medicare contracts . The government has specified that they need not " cover , furnish , or pay for a particular counseling or referral service " that is objectionable to them on moral or religious grounds . Furthermore , if Bush 's " faith-based " initiative moves forward , which would make it easier for religious organizations to receive federal funds , it could set up what one ACLU attorney refers to as " the fiber-conscience clause . " For affluent women who can switch plans or physicians or pay out of pocket , detouring around a noncompliance clause is inconvenient , but not necessarily life-threatening . But for low  --  income women , who may have to travel miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hours to be seen , getting the red light on a desired service can mean that there are no more options . " We 're facing a world where privately insured women pay for the services they need , and low-income women are offered prayer , " says Catherine Weiss , head of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project , which has held a series of workshops on noncompliance clauses . NONCOMPLIANCE- NOW IN YOUR LOCAL DRUGSTORE Almost immediately after the 1998 approval of the emergency contraceptives Preven and Plan B , pharmacists started refusing to fill prescriptions for these drugs-and codifying their right to do so in the regulations of state pharmacists associations . These codes are not law , but they do encourage individual pharmacists ' acts of refusal . Groups like Pharmacists for Life International offer consulting and legal support if a pharmacist loses her or his job on the basis of a refusal . For a woman trying to get the pills within 72 hours ( a World Health Organization task force found that they 're actually most effective in the first 12 ) any delay can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pharmacist willing to dispense EC may be impossible . " It 's the atypical woman who says , Excuse me , I am entitled to this and who are you going to send me to ? " ' says Nancy M. Yanofsky , president of the ProChoice Resource Center , which has launched a nationwide awareness campaign . While pharmacists ' regulations are n't binding , they do foster a climate in which women are intimidated and thwarted in efforts to access urgently needed health care services . And they are influencing lawmakers : in South Dakota , a noncompliance clause actually makes it legal for pharmacists to refuse to fill a prescription for EC . In response , Robert Tendler , a Connecticut pharmacist , has formed the national organization Pharmacists for Choice . " I do not have the right to impose my political , ethical , or moral views on anybody else , " he has said . " When I put on the white coat and go behind the counter , my obligation is to the patient . " The current crisis is making women 's health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to fight for our health rights . Some argue that concessions have been offered too quickly . Maryland , for example , was the first state to pass an EPICC bill . Women 's advocates there , anticipating a fight , voluntarily inserted their own noncompliance clause , allowing religious organizations to opt out of covering contraceptives . " They did n't think much about it , " says Caitlin Borgmann , state strategies coordinator for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project . " It seemed pretty innocuous . " Advocates in other states followed suit , and it took several episodes in which anti-choice legislators made eleventh-hour changes before progressives understood that introducing a clause of any kind is a hefty risk . " Advocates now realize they should n't have put in a clause to start off with , " says Borgmann . " Once you 've got it in there , you have nowhere to go . " A NEW POSITION The solution , say Yanofsky and Weiss , is to reject all noncompliance clauses outright . Weiss points out that if you accept the premise that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a physician who is a Jehovah 's Witness could refuse to provide blood transfusions . Of course , " the moral stance of certain religious groups receives more credence than others , and Jehovah 's Witnesses clearly do n't have as much clout as the Catholic Church , " so they are n't allowed to impose their beliefs on their patients , she says . " We have n't done what the civil rights movement did , which is to say , This is our line in the sand , do n't you dare cross over it , ' " says Yanofsky . " People are afraid if they say no to one thing , they wo n't get anything . " Equally important , say advocates , is the recognition that a medical standard-of-care , whether it is for reproductive health , HIV , or diabetes , is not open to editing or debate . " This is the only area in which we 've created an exception to the general rule that physicians have to tell people about their options , " says Jon Merz , a reproductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a pregnant woman diagnosed with cancer in a hospital that does not perform abortions might be less likely to receive aggressive chemotherapy that could harm the fetus . When certain procedures are off limits , Mertz asks , " What are the determinants of women 's care ? " To get more women up in arms , the ProChoice Resource Center is sponsoring the Spotlight Campaign , a national series of conferences on noncompliance clauses that will bring lawyers , civic organizations , health care professionals , legislators , and reproductive rights advocates together . The ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project helps local groups oppose noncompliance clauses when they arise . Since many states do not require health care providers to post their noncompliance status , the ProChoice Resource Center suggests that women ask health care providers and local hospitals what services they refuse to offer , and publicize this in editorials or with local community groups .

Y // <p>                     @x CHAPTER I <br> <p> Courtney Glass whipped into the gravel lot and cursed the man toad who 'd invited her here . This was August . Texas . It was ninety-nine degrees outside , and any halfway sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not parked at a deserted hike-and-bike trail , hoping to score after lunch . <p> Did he think this was romantic ? Spontaneous , maybe ? Despite the Ivy League diploma , John David Alvin could be a real idiot . <p> Courtney huffed out a breath and flipped down the vanity mirror . Idiot or not , she wanted to look good . Looking good was the best revenge , especially when it came to ex-boyfriends . <p> But the Beauty Gods were n't smiling on her today . The humidity had turned her hair limp , and her makeup was practically melting off . She dug through her purse , seeking inspiration but finding little . She blotted her forehead with a tissue and fluffed her hair . She started to put on lipstick , then decided to hell with it . Who cared if she impressed David ? He was the last person she wanted to see right now . She should n't even be here , really , but his insistent messages were driving her crazy . They needed to hash this thing out , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rearview mirror caught her eye . He was here . She watched the black Porsche Cayenne glide up alongside her . He 'd traded in the red Carrera , apparently , which should n't have come as a surprise . Suddenly nervous , she cast a glance around her Buick Skylark , a hulking testament to the emptiness of her bank account . Courtney could work wonders with drugstore cosmetics , and she was a bloodhound for treasures in a thrift shop , but this car was beyond help . Until she climbed out of credit card debt , she was stuck in a ' 98 clunker with a temperamental AC . She turned up the power now and adjusted the vents . <p> David sat in his SUV , but did n't get out . Courtney could feel his gaze on her while she cleared clutter off the front seat . She refused to make eye contact . This was his meeting , and he was going to have to come to her . She did n't relish the thought of talking to him in her heap , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field advantage by getting into his Porsche . <p> From the corner of her eye , she saw him exit the car and fist his hands on his hips . She set her chin . She could match wills with him any day of the week . Sweat beaded between her breasts as she waited , silently , gazing through the windshield at the dragonflies playing in the sunshine . <p> Finally the Buick 's door squeaked open , and he slid into the passenger seat . He wore a crisp white shirt with monogrammed cuffs , a red power tie , and his usual dark pants . In an instant , the Skylark smelled like Drakkar Noir . <p> Courtney looked at him with disgust as she rolled down her window . <p> " Well ? " <p> " Well , what ? " she shot back . " You called me . " <p> " I most certainly did not . " <p> " Text message . Whatever . " God , he was such a prick . Just smelling him again made her want to retch . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have time for this shit . This is bordering on harassment . " <p> " Harassment ? " <p> Suddenly the back door jerked open . Courtney turned around and found herself face-to-face with a black ski mask . <p> The man pulled a gun out of his pants and pointed it at David 's nose . " Gim me your phone . " <p> All the breath whooshed out of Courtney 's lungs . She gaped at the gray eyes glaring out from holes in the mask . <p> He jabbed the gun at David 's neck . " Now , asshole ! " <p> She glanced at her ex-boyfriend . His arrogance had morphed into fear , and he was n't moving . Do it ! She tried to tell him mentally , but he was frozen . At last , he braced a hand on the dashboard and jammed the other into his front pocket . <p> She cast a panicked look outside . No one . This was unreal . It was the middle of the day . Granted , it was hotter than hell outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel swung toward her , and her stomach dropped out . <p> " Yours , too . " <p> She stared at the twisting pink mouth and tried to process the words . Hers , too . Her phone . He wanted her phone . Did he want her money , also ? Her phone was in her purse , along with her Mace . <p> " Come on ! " <p> David tossed his phone at the guy , and it landed with a clatter on the back floorboard . The man scooped it up and shoved it in the pocket of his tracksuit . <p> Then the masked head turned toward her . " Now , or I 'll blow his fucking brains out . " <p> David went pale . He sent her a desperate look . " Hurry , Courtney ! " <p> Her purse was near her feet . On the floor . And her Mace was in there . She dragged the bag into her lap and thrust her hand inside . She groped for the tube of pepper spray but could n't find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't die yet . There 's so much I have n't done . <p> " Now ! " The eyes watching her through the cutouts squinted . <p> Her clammy fingers closed around the phone , and she pulled it free . She held it out to him . <p> Time stretched out as the phone hovered there in her trembling hand . He reached for it . He wore tight black gloves , and she knew  --  with sudden certainty  --  this was going to end badly . <p> He squeezed her wrist , and the phone dropped to the floor . He did n't let go her hand . <p> " Take my wallet , " David said , yanking it loose from his back pocket . " Take whatever you want . " <p> Courtney watched , transfixed , as the black-gloved hand pried open her fingers . Did he want her ring ? The cheap silver trinket from Santa Fe ? <p> " I 've got cash . " David 's voice hitched . " I 've got a Rolex . " <p> The pistol slapped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the grip . Suddenly she realized what was happening . She tried to yank her arm away , but could n't . <p> " No ! " she shrieked , pulling her arm until her shoulder burned . <p> David 's gaze met hers . <p> Pop ! <p> Their bodies jerked in unison . Surprise flickered in his eyes as red bloomed on his white shirt . He sagged sideways , thunking his head against the windshield . <p> Courtney 's ears rang . A high-pitched noise rasped in and out of her throat as she stared at the gun in her hand . The gloved fingers closed around hers again , and she thrashed sideways , trying to wrench her arm away . <p> " No ! " She used her free hand to punch at the ski mask as hard as she could . Her whole arm reverberated from theblow . <p> Pop ! <p> The windshield exploded . Screaming , she hunched downin her seat . Her gaze landed on her purse , wedged betweenher leg and the door . The Mace was there , peeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crushed as theman forced her unwilling fingers around the grip . With herleft , she grabbed the Mace . Her wrist twisted painfully . Thegun barrel turned toward her . <p> Her thumb found the top of the vial . A stream shot out , straight at the ugly pink mouth in the hole of the mask . <p> " Fuck ! " <p> She crashed backward into the steering wheel as her armwas released . Curses and moans filled the car as she clawedfrantically at the door latch . The door popped open , and shepitched sideways onto the gravel . She tasted dust and jerkedher legs free from the car . She glanced back over her shoulderand saw David slumped against the dashboard . <p> The back door squeaked open . <p> She scrambled to her feet and ran . <br> <p> Nathan Devereaux fed a few quarters into the hospital vending machine and ordered up some lunch . His tour had started at 2:00 this morning , and he 'd been running for fourteen hours straight on nothing but coffee . <p> " Want anything ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side of the waiting room . The guy was peering through the miniblinds at the traffic on North Lamar . Either he did n't hear the question , or he was being an asshole . Nathan had known Will Hodges less than forty-eight hours , but his money was on the latter . <p> " Hodges ! " <p> The guy 's gaze shot up . " Yeah ? " <p> " You want anything ? " <p> " No . " <p> Asshole it was . Nathan fished his Mars Bar from the vending machine and wandered toward the hallway , hoping to see the forensic artist they were waiting on . No sign of her . It had been nearly an hour , and the door to Room 632 was still shut , meaning that she was still in there interviewing his witness for the suspect sketch . <p> Nathan ripped open his lunch . On days like this , he really felt his age . He had n't even hit forty yet , but ten years as a homicide detective and a steady diet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He still looked good enough to get his share of come-ons at bars , but his energy was n't what it used to be . <p> He watched his new partner from across the room . The kid looked like he could bench-press a VW . He probably ate protein shakes for breakfast and made it to the gym six times a week . <p> Give him a year . <p> Nathan chomped into his candy bar and glanced at hiswatch . <p> " We 're finished . " <p> He turned around at the familiar voice . Fiona Glass stood in the doorway holding her battered leather art case and a sheet of paper . She wore a conservative beige pantsuit and had her reddish-blond hair pulled neatly back in a headband . <p> Nathan crossed the room to take the sketch she held out to him . One look at it had his gut twisting . <p> " A profile ? That 's all she saw ? " <p> " She says he grabbed her from behind and the only real glimpse she got was when he fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice and glanced up . " What 's the deal ? " <p> She darted her gaze around the waiting room , as if to make sure no one else could overhear . She paused briefly on Hodges , and Nathan knew she did n't trust him yet . Fiona was slow to warm up to people , and Hodges had been with Austin PD less than a week . <p> " What 's the problem ? " Nathan prompted . <p> " Everything . " She nodded at the drawing . " What does that look like to you ? " <p> " I do n't know . Black male . Twenty-five . Average features . " <p> " And his expression ? " <p> He stared down at the picture . She had drawn it in charcoal on a sheet of thick gray art paper . He could smell the fixative on it , which meant the witness had declared it finished . <p> Nathan studied the face of the man who had attacked a prominent judge and her husband in their carport shortly after midnight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Precisely . " <p> He met Fiona 's gaze and remembered why he loved working with her . She had the eye of an artist , but she thought like a detective . <p> " He robbed two people at gunpoint and shot one of them in the face , " she said . " I 'd expect to see aggression , nerves , panic . Anything but boredom . " <p> " You think we got a false alligator ? " <p> " The angle bothers me , too , " she continued , avoiding the question . Nathan knew why . The witness was a municipal judge . If Nathan suggested she might be lying about who shot her husband , the result would be a virtual shit storm . <p> " The angle . You mean because it 's a profile ? " <p> " It 's very rare to get only a side view , particularly the right side . " <p> Nathan frowned at the drawing . " You 're saying it should have been a left-side profile ? " <p> She shrugged . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " <p> " Bank robberies . " <p> Nathan glanced over at Hodges . He still stood beside the window , but apparently he 'd been paying attention . " What 's that ? " <p> " If a witness only sees a profile , it 's usually the getaway driver , " Hodges said . <p> Wow , an entire sentence . Nathan glanced at Fiona . She was staring at his new partner again , looking impressed now , but still distrustful . <p> She turned back to Nathan . " So based on the interview , and the information provided , and the information not provided , I 'd say your witness has a credibility problem . " <p> Just what he needed . A well-respected judge with a credibility problem . He could n't wait to run this up the flagpole . <p> He decided to play devil 's advocate . " What about her injuries ? She claims she was knocked to the ground , and she 's got a concussion to back that up . " <p> " I do n't know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It could have been someone she knew . " <p> Nathan 's head started to pound . He had to unravel this murder case , deal with the politics , and train a rookie detective all at the same time . This case was going to suck . <p> Fiona took out a manila envelope , slid the drawing inside , and handed it to him . The sketch was eight inches by fourteen , just the right size to fit in his case file . She paid attention to details like that . <p> " Call me if you need anything else . " She turned to Hodges . " Welcome to Austin . It was nice meeting you . " <p> She disappeared into an elevator , and Nathan looked at Hodges , who was still standing on the other side of the room . <p> " You get all that ? " <p> He gave a slight nod . <p> " You agree with her ? " <p> Another nod . Not much of a talker , this guy . It was going to be a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded , and Nathan reached for the phone clipped to his hip , just beneath his side holster . " Devereaux . " <p> " We 've got a Code 37 at Zilker Park . " <p> " I 'm at Seton Hospital on the Goodwin interview . Give it to Webb . " <p> " He 's still in court . You and Hodges are it . " <p> Could this day get any worse ? Nathan pulled out his notepad and jotted down a few details before hanging up . Then he made a call and arranged for a uniform to hightail it over , just in case the Honorable Judge Goodwin decided to check herself out of the hospital . Finally , he turned to his partner . <p> " We got a shooting at Zilker . " He lobbed the rest of his stale candy bar into a trash can . " I 'm driving . " <p> Ten minutes later , they were in an unmarked unit en route to Austin 's largest park . Hodges had said nothing since leaving the hospital . Nathan slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been in the military not so long ago . He decided to make more of an effort . <p> " You ever work homicide before now ? " <p> " Narcotics . " <p> " Well , there 's three rules once we get to the scene : Do n't touch anything . Do n't touch anything . And do n't fucking touch anything . " <p> Hodges kept his eyes trained on the road . <p> " And you can pretty much bet that the least competent jackass we got wearing a badge is going to be the first responder . It never fails . And it 's been that kind of day . " <p> Nathan swung onto Barton Springs Road , the four-lane street that cut straight through the park . He could already see the congestion up ahead , where a uniform had diverted traffic away from the parking lot serving the hike-and-bike trail that paralleled Town Lake . Nathan off-roaded it for a few hundred feet and then flashed his ID at the guy manning the blockade . He started to move the wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble . The narrow road wound down closer to the water and ended at a gravel parking lot surrounded by dense foliage . <p> Nathan jogged here sometimes and knew the area well . Typically , this lot would be filling up right now , despite the oppressive heat . But the only cars parked here today were police units , a crime-scene van , and a silent yellow ambulance.No news crews yet , but it would n't take long . Nathan pulled up beside the ambulance and waved at a paramedic he knew vaguely . <p> They parked and made their way over to the crime scene , which had already been taped off . Inside the cordoned-off area , on a tree-shaded patch of gravel , sat a blue Buick Skylark and a black Porsche Cayenne . Both vehicles faced a thicket of mesquite and mulberry bushes . The Cayenne 's doors were closed . The two doors on the Buick 's left side stood open , and a photographer knelt between them now , taking a picture . <p> Nathan approached the dour policewoman standing beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd been right about the jackass thing . <p> He nodded .

I just  --  " <p> " Never move the victim . " <p> " I did n't . His wallet 's sitting open right there on the floor . I saw his ID through the window . " <p> Nathan took the clipboard she held out to him and scrawled his name and badge number on the crime-scene log  --  which consisted of a torn slip of paper . Hodges followed suit , and they both ducked under the tape . <p> John Alvin . The name rang a bell , but Nathan did n't know why . Alvin . Alvin .

Sometimes Nathan longed for a job in Minnesota . Or Vancouver . Anyplace where it took insects longer than twelve seconds to go to work on a corpse . <p> " Hey , Bart . " Nathan crouched down beside him . The photographer 's olfactory nerves had gone numb already , and he was snapping away with his camera , oblivious to the smell . Nathan needed a minute . <p> " Close range , " Bart said . " I 'd say about one meter . " <p> Nathan ducked his head lower to get a better angle . He could just barely make out the face .... <p> John David Alvin . Attorney-at-law . Nathan had met the man back in January . <p> " Shit , " he muttered , standing up .

" <p> The officer nodded toward a unit parked on the fareastern edge of the lot . The back door of the car was open , and a woman sat there , barefoot , her elbows propped on her knees , her head buried in her hands . <p> " Shit . " <p> " What ?
