Section : WOMEN who ROCK ROLLING STONE PRESENTS From Dolly Parton and Sleater-Kinney to the women who rule in hip-hop She 's the lady , the tramp and the queen <p> EVERYWHERE DOLLY PARton goes , she sings . She 's somewhere in her sizable Nashville production company . But where ? Then you hear it : an old hymn - " Peace in the Valley " - echoing down the hallway , that silk ribbon of a soprano along with the tap-tap-tap of her insanely high heels , a uniquely Dolly blend of sex and scripture . " Well , hello , " she chirps , a big grin on her face that says , " I know , I know , just take it all in . " The impossibly tiny waist , the high platinum wig , the long , glossy red nails , the famous bosoms ( God-given , by the way , although she did have them lifted and augmented after she lost weight in the Eighties ) . At fifty-seven , Parton brims with vitality , and she is glorious in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few shades of purple eye shadow , glossy pink lips and five-inch stilettos - this , God love her , for her trip to the chiropractor later in the afternoon . <p> " The way I dress , for the most part , is how most people would dress for a costume party , " she says in her silvery drawl , settling into a chair . " It would scare most people to death to look this cheap or whore-y , but to me , I 'm comfortable . " Another twinkly grin . " The way I look was really a country girl 's idea of what glamour was . I patterned my look after the town tramp . I thought she was the prettiest thing in the world , with all that bleached hair and bright-red lipstick . People would say , ' Oh , she 's just trash , ' and I 'd think , ' That 's what I want to be when I grow up . ' " <p> It 's easy to be dazzled by Parton 's winking-rhinestone persona and cheerful self-parody - this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breasts " shock and awe . " Indeed , there is so much to jostle for your attention - the film roles , the theme park - that her greatest talent is often overlooked . Parton is one of the most gifted and prolific songwriters in the business , a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame along-side the likes of Bob Dylan and Duke Ellington . Since she arrived in Nashville from the hills of eastern Tennessee in 1964 , she has published more than 3,000 songs , ranging from country to pop to bluegrass to gospel . Her specialty is telling stories - of a poor child who is teased at school for her patchwork " Coat of Many Colors , " a woman who has been used but is still hopeful in " The Bargain Store " or the tale of a misunderstood mountain hermit , " Joshua , " a hand-clapping stomp that was released in 1971 but could have been out in the Thirties , or last week . <p> Some of her dozens of singles have become hits for others , most famously Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love You " pales beside Parton 's gentle original . Her songs have been covered by Patti Smith and the White Stripes , who put their stamp on one of her most celebrated tunes , " Jolene , " a stark plea to a man-stealer . <p> " Oh , Dolly 's big in Iceland , " says Bjrk . " Her voice is immaculate , really powerful . Her character is so warm and human , and she has a. great sense of humor . " To Bjrk , Parton transcends her musical genre . " All my friends love Dolly , and most of them are people who would never listen to country music , " she says . " It does n't happen very often when you get a character that is sort of larger than life . I do n't like rock music , but I like Kurt Cobain . He could be playing any style of music and I would have been interested . You know ? And I think Dolly is like that . She is an incredible singer , an incredible songwriter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordplay ; on the more somber tracks , death hovers ominously nearby , reflecting her hardscrabble Appalachian upbringing . " Even when I 'm writing a modern song , I 'll find myself pulling stuff from those days before I ever left home , " she says . " The days of Mama and Daddy and my grandmas and grandpas , and church days . All I ever have to do is close my eyes and just kind of go inside . " She is constantly writing ( " It do n't ever stop " ) , so she keeps notebooks and tape recorders scattered all over the house - by the bed , the tub and in the kitchen when she cooks . <p> Parton is always in motion - as she sits and chats , her leg jiggles with pent-up energy . She applies this vigor to her career : Although it stretches back more than forty years , Parton refuses to be calcified into a " legend . " When the radio all but stopped playing her in the Nineties , she deftly avoided the fate of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit , returning to tradition with a trio of bluegrass albums released on a smaller label . Freed up creatively without the major-label pressure to crank out hits , Parton has made some of the best music of her career , picking up a couple of Grammys and a host of new fans along the way , their interest kindled by O Brother mania . <p> Parton 's next album - her seventy-third - moves into different territory . " I was just king of piddling around , doing some demos , " she says , " when all of a sudden I thought , ' This is the time to do a patriotic , gospel-type album . ' " Thus , For God and Country . In a new tribute album , Just Because I 'm a Woman : Songs of Dolly Parton , she is saluted by Sinad O'Connor , Shelby Lynne and Shania Twain . " Shania said , ' Do n't let anybody have " Coat of Many Colors , " and Dolly has to sing harmony , ' " Parton recalls . It was a sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parents were killed and who related to the song 's message of pride in the face of poverty . " After she recorded it , I sang harmony on it , " says Parton . " And when they sent Shania the track , she just cried like a baby . And I thought , ' Well , if you can live long enough and do something special enough to bring out that kind of emotion in somebody , that 's what it 's all about . ' " <p> DESPITE ALL THE MODERN TRAPpings of her fame and success , Dolly Parton is a living link to what seems like an impossibly remote past . She was born the fourth of twelve children in a log cabin in Sevier County , Tennessee , on the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park . The doctor who brought her into the world was paid with a sack of cornmeal . The Partons did n't have electricity or indoor plumbing , and her dad , a tobacco farmer , supplemented the family 's diet by taking his shotgun and heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about eating squirrel and groundhogs , but in the mountains like that , you really did n't have much of a choice , " says Parton matter-of-factly . " There were twelve of us kids . We never ate possum - I remember Daddy saying , " That 's like a damn rat . ' But we ate everything - turtle , frogs . I just remember the big old groundhogs - whistle pigs , they called them - and you 'd cook ' em with sweet potatoes , and you 'd have different ways of making some of that gamy taste go away . " <p> Having to do without , wearing feed-sack dresses that her mother , Avie , sewed , did n't make Dolly bitter . Instead , it fostered in her a sense of resilient optimism that characterizes so much of her writing . " People say , ' You were so poor , what did you play with ? ' Well , I played with David and Denver and Stella " - her siblings . One Christmas , young Dolly cried for a doll that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby brother , Randy . Look , you got a doll better than everybody 's , said her dad . This one walks and talks and pees and everything . <p> The whole extended Parton clan was musical . They sang at home ; they sang at church , where anyone who had a mind to could bring in an instrument and make a joyful noise unto the Lord . Dolly 's grandpa wrote songs and played the fiddle , and her uncle Bill , himself a musician , gave Dolly a Martin guitar when she was seven . By age ten , Dolly 's performances at local gatherings led to a gig on a Knoxville radio and television program called Cas Walter 's Farm and Home Hour . Old Man Cas was a grocer , and frequently during a show he would walk behind the singers or the banjo pickers toting signs that said things like " Fresh greens , 19 cents a mess . " <p> The more attention Parton got , the more she seemed to crave ( eleven siblings , remember ) . Even as a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and earned a whipping from her dad when she painted her lips with Mercurochrome from the medicine cabinet . " I lied about it , " she says , laughing helplessly . " I said , ' This is my natural color ! ' The more Daddy tried to rub it off , the redder it was . It 's like , ' This red ass of yours after a whipping , is that your natural color ? ' Oh , I got lots of whippin 's over makeup . " <p> She graduated from high school - the first in her family to do so - on a Friday , and headed for Nashville on Saturday . The day she arrived , she met her future husband at the Wishy-Washy Laundromat . ( Carl Dean is a shy , rarely photographed man who to this day stays well out of the spotlight . ) Parton released a few minor singles before landing a life-changing invitation to join The Porter Wagoner Show , a well-known TV program , in 1967 . The show often took to the road , and Parton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female company . " It was hell , " she says . " But in the early days when I was traveling in the bus , Porter saw to it that I had my own little bathroom and a tiny little sink , where I did n't have to pee in the same room with the guys . " <p> Back then , says Parton , there were n't many women in the music industry . " There was Patsy Cline and Loretta and Tammy and me , " she says . " There were just very few of us , and they were all under the direction of men . " <p> That included Parton , although her seven-year partnership with the often ornery Wagoner was popular and fruitful and made her a country star . It seems quaint now . but a few of her singles stirred up quite a bit of controversy . In 1968 , for instance , " Just Because I 'm a Woman " caused a fuss . " That song was based on a true story , " she says . " My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 's old enough now , so he do n't really give a big shit . " She cackles . " See , I had had sex before we met , but I had n't mentioned it , and he had n't asked . We were married for eight months , happy as we could be , and all of a sudden he decides to ask . I told him the truth , and it broke his heart . He could not get over that for the longest time . I thought , ' Well , my goodness , what 's the big damn deal ? ' " <p> Though some stations refused to play it in the U.S. , it did hit Number One in South Africa , much to her delight . " I had a lot of fans in South Africa ! " she hoots . " All those oppressed women ! I found that so amusing , because somebody said , ' Hey , my mistakes are no worse than yours , just because I 'm a woman . ' " She was still having these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play " The Eagle When She Flies . " " Lots of DJs would n't play ' The Eagle When She Flies , ' because they thought it was such a women's-lib song , " says Parton . <p> In 1974 , Parton , feeling confined by her stormy partnership with Wagoner , stopped touring with the show , emboldened by her Number One country hit " Jolene . " Wagoner was not pleased , and he took her to court a few years later . " I will always be grateful to Porter , because I learned a lot , " says Parton , who wrote " I Will Always Love You " as a thank-you to Wagoner . " But he got as much out of me as I got out of him , let 's put it that way . Porter was very much like my dad and my brothers and the men I grew up with . They were just manly men , and a woman 's place was where you told her to be . And so I would always stand up to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here just to be the girl singer on Porter Wagoner 's show . " She sighs . " And we fought like hell , and he showed his ass about it , rather than just letting life flow . He had to sue me . And , of course , that broke both our hearts . And , you know , looking back on it now , he hates that he did that and has said so . " <p> After she was free , Parton began to diversify madly . The Eighties saw the establishment of her 150-acre Dollywood theme park in 1986 . She starred in big Hollywood movies such as 9 to 5 and Steel Magnolias , and placed songs on the pop charts : " 9 to 5 " and " Islands in the Stream . " Her sexy , effervescent personality translated easily to the screen , and she sparkled even in clunkers like Rhinestone , with Sylvester Stallone . Though critics fricasseed it ( " acres of unfunny dialogue , " went a typical review ) , she will always have warm feelings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst period of her life . She was depressed and overweight and in the midst of firing some longtime business associates . After almost collapsing onstage in Indianapolis , she underwent surgery in 1982 for what she calls " female problems , hormonal disorders " and sank further into depression , filling notebooks with black thoughts such as " Why should I commit suicide ? I 'm waking up dead every day . " <p> Relief came , as it so often does , in the form of Sly Stallone . " Even though the movie did n't do that well , that was one of my greatest projects , " says Parton . " Because Stallone was so full of life , and so crazy and so funny and he made me laugh a lot , which was real healthy for me . That movie got me back on track . " <p> Soon afterward , she found out that she could n't have children , which , over time , she has learned to accept . " I just think , you know , it ai n't meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't regret it . My husband do n't regret it . He 's like my only child , I 'm like his only child . And the older we get , the gladder we are that we do n't have them now , because we take care of a lot of other people 's kids . We buy new cars for all the nieces and nephews that graduate , we send any to college that want to go . " <p> In the Nineties , as the country-music industry became a sleek machine that cranked out twenty-two-year-old blow-dried insta-stars . Parton found doors closing on her all over Nashville . " Back in the older days , it was just a more friendly , personable , one-on-one business , " she says . " Now it 's just whoever is selling . " Parton cast a hard eye on her situation and figured out what to do next . " When the new country came along , any artist over thirty-five was thought to be a has-been , " she says . " And , Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me like a legend . But I was n't near done . I felt like I was better than I ever was . I feel like I 'm just now seasoned enough to know how to be in this business . And I thought , ' Well , hell , I 'm not going down with the rest of them old farts . I 'm gon na find some new ways of doing it . ' And that 's exactly what I did . " <p> She started her own label , Blue Eye Records , and now she records and pays for her own albums , then leases them to small labels such as Sugar Hill . " I thought , ' Well , now I can record the stuff I really want to , ' and I do n't have fourteen managers and record executives saying , ' Oh , you got ta be more commercial , you got ta be more pop . ' I thought , ' I do n't care if I write a song like " Mountain Angel " that 's six or seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I 'm not gon na think , ' Oh , I have to cut this down to fit the radio . ' If they play it on the radio , fine . Doubt if they would , and do n't care anymore . " She catches herself . " Well , I mean , of course you care and wish you could be accepted everywhere , but I 'm not catering to that anymore . And I 'm happier than I 've ever been doing it like that . " <p> All three of the bluegrass albums Parton has released - 1999 's The Grass Is Blue , 2001 's Little Sparrow and last year 's Halos and Horns - sparkle with the unadulterated fun of simply making music . On Halos and Horns , she passed up the usual seasoned session players for lesser-known musicians , some of whom work at Dollywood . She has covered Gershwin , Collective Soul 's " Shine " ( " Everybody thought I was nuts when I said I was going to do it , and I ' won a Grammy off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven , " of all things . ( The Zep camp was complimentary : " They said they never thought of doing it like that , but it was a job well done . " ) <p> Parton jokes that she had to get rich to sing like she was poor again , and she has : Underneath the folksy demeanor beats the heart of a notoriously shrewd businesswoman , one who is worth an estimated $300 million . " I think that if I am smart in business , it 's just that I 'm smart about who I am , " she says . " I know what I can , ca n't , will and wo n't do , and if I have to be strict about that , I will . " Her role model is her father , who was n't able to read and write , " but Daddy was real smart when it came to knowing the value of a dollar and how to make a deal , whether it was a horse trade or whatever . " <p> Her ventures over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a children 's book ; a TV variety show ; a 1996 sitcom called Mindin ' My Own Business , about a Southerner who moves to Los Angeles to start a party-planning company ; an autobiography ; and a clothing line , 9 to 5ers , for working women . When something does n't work , she tries something else . <p> Her most successful endeavor has been Dollywood , located in Pigeon Forge , a few miles from her birth site . Many people who are raised in near-poverty try to distance themselves from their upbringing , but not Parton , whose ticket out turned into a round-trip . Dollywood has given hundreds of people jobs in Pigeon Forge , including many in the Parton clan . Along with the usual rides , there are Appalachian craftsmen , a Dolly museum and a replica of Parton 's childhood home with the furniture her family used . " I love Dollywood , because I love to go shopping up there in the stores , " she says gleefully . " I think , ' Oh , good , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of myself . " Parton also owns a chainlet of dinner theaters called the Dixie Stampede , which are doing quite well , thank you : She just opened her fourth , to the tune of $28 million , in Orlando . <p> " I 've been very fortunate and have made some good choices and good investments , " she says . " And I 'm not having to do any of it for the money now . That 's a good feeling , but the thing is , that just goes to show you how passionate I am about the music . I have to write and sing . See , that was my first love , and I have to do that forever , however I have to do it . " <p> Parton will be fifty-eight in January but feels like she is just starting out . She percolates with new plans : a tour , which starts early next year ; a dance album ; a Broadway musical based on her life . " I feel like a child , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different than I did when I walked down these streets the first time I came to Nashville , in 1964 . " Parton and the elusive Dean , who have been married thirty-seven years , have an easy , joking relationship . His nickname for her is Catfish , because , he tells her , she 's all mouth and no brains . Parton claims they 've never had a major fight . " Swear to God , " she says . " We get pissy , but it would scare me to death if Carl ever screamed at me . " The two often lead separate lives : Dean does n't accompany his famous wife when she goes on tour , nor does he join her at any glitzy events . In 1966 , a miserable Dean put on a tuxedo and escorted Parton to an awards ceremony . Afterward he told her , " I love you , and I will support you in your career any way I can , but I am not going to any more of these Wingdings . " He has pretty much kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public , she says , the pair 's day to day life is " simple and ordinary . " They live in a house outside Nashville that Parton had built thirty years ago to look like Tara from Gone With the Wind - because , she has said , when you grow up poor , that 's what you think rich Southern folks would do . When Parton is kicking back , the makeup stays on , but the wig comes off ( her real hair is shoulder-length ) , the feet come up , and she wears sweats and thermals . " I call ' em my baby clothes , " she says . She rarely plays the radio or puts on the TV preferring to read a book instead . <p> " I look so totally artificial , " she says , " but I 've always been the simplest person in the world . " Indeed , for Parton the past is tangibly , comfortably close . It 's right there in front of her - in her music , in the woods outside , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either you grow up wearing flour-sack dresses or you do n't ) . When she was a girl , she had a grandma who was an invalid . Most of her siblings would n't stay long to visit , but Dolly would , dutifully emptying her grandma 's bedpan and brushing her false teeth . Why ? Because she had a Sears , Roebuck catalog and loved to order things for herself and for her granddaughter . <p> " I got a lot of stuff staying with her , " Parton remembers . " I love catalogs to this day . You know those damn gift catalogs on airplanes ? I 'll pick out twenty things that I do n't need , and I know it goes back to my childhood , because I wanted everything I saw in that book . It 's embedded in my psyche , I guess . " The mountains are around her and within her , and what sustained her at age seven sustains her at fifty-seven - her family , her time with the Lord and the music . She may have adapted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has stayed defiantly herself . <p> She will always remain , she says cheerfully , " a white-trash person . I still eat Velveeta . " Yeah , right . " I do ! " she crows . " You want me to show you in my apartment next door ? I fried some Spam yesterday morning ! " She leaps up . " You come take a look ! " She races past a room that houses some pristine-looking exercise equipment . " Do I use it ? Hell , no , " she snorts . " But I buy everything that comes on the market . " Good Lord , she moves fast in those heels . How does she do that ? <p> She opens the door to a small apartment adjoining the larger building . Racks of spangly clothes line the hallway , and there is a dressing table crowded with lotions and potions . She heads for her kitchen , a homey place with magnets on the fridge and blue Mexican tiles lining the walls . " Look , " she says triumphantly , throwing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corned-beef hash , tins of Spam , loaves of white bread , a Costco-size brick of Velveeta . " I have to have my Spam , " she says . " And look at this ! " It 's a pig-shaped ceramic jar . Inside is a baggie of bacon grease , neatly labeled with a date . " The people who come to clean my house every Thursday have to fry up bacon , so I have bacon grease to cook with . I have to have it in all my houses . " She brightens . " You want some Velveeta ? " She saws off an orange hunk and offers it . " You did n't believe me , did you ? " she says . " I grew up with that stuff and I never got over it . Good , ai n't it ?
