It is the first Sunday evening of the summer , the sky an ash rose color and losing its light to night . I am sitting on the floor in my room with a mirror propped up against a stack of magazines , setting my hair according to the directions in Modern Style . If I do it right , I will get a perfect flip . I just need to sleep in such a way that the rollers do not become pushed out of place , as they usually do . Either they get pushed out of place or I take them all out in the middle of the night . I do n't know why . I do n't even remember doing it , I just wake up and there the rollers are , thrown down on the floor . I guess my sleep self and my awake self do n't agree about beauty . The radio is turned on low to " Moody River , " and my question is , Why did she kill herself if the guy was just a friend ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his heart is broken ? He sounds like Perry Como singing " Magic Moments " when he should be sounding like Brenda Lee sobbing , " I 'm sorry , sooo sorry . " I am thinking about how tomorrow I will lie out on a towel in the yard , slicked up with baby oil to get going on my tan . I like it when you lie there for a long time and feel the sun 's heat like a red thing behind your lids . You see a map of your own veins , and then when you open your eyes the view is bleached a bit of its colors . When I was nine years old someone told me you must never look at the sun straight on because it could make you blind . This made me go right outside and stare up at it , and when my eyes protested and shut automatically , I held my lids open until my eyes burned and watered so much I had to stop . I did not go blind . I do have to wear glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . I am this way , sometimes , that I just have to find things out for myself . I have a feeling percolating under my skin that says this will be a really important summer . Just a feeling that does n't go away . I think sometimes I am a little psychic , like my grandmother who could read tea leaves . She would sit at the kitchen table with her beautiful white hair up in a bun , and she would be wearing an apron that sagged over her bosom like another bosom . She would stare into the cup for a long time , and nobody talked ; even the air seemed to hold still . Then she would look up , and her blue eyes would seem clearer and not quite her own . She would settle her shoulders , and , in a low and intimate voice , tell people things about their lives . I thought for a long time she was a gypsy queen , but my mind just made that up ; she was really just a woman from England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewife who made good gravy and kept a parakeet in her kitchen . Once , when I was in third grade , my grandmother read tea leaves for me . My mother was there , and her sisters , my aunts Rose and Betty , were there , too . I remember I was so nervous I sat under the kitchen table , and my grandmother had to tell me things without looking at me . She said I had a boyfriend , which was true , Billy Harris was his name , and I got all embarrassed even though no one could see me . Then she told me he liked me too , which was not so true , since if you asked him , " Do you like Katie Nash ? " he would have said , " Who ? " I miss my aunts a lot . Since my mother died a couple of years ago , I never see them anymore . We used to go and visit for a week or so every summer . Rose was very prim and proper , but full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my cousins and I washed up for bed at night in a dishpan at the kitchen sink , and Aunt Rose made sure we got our ears good . Ivory soap , she used , those floating cakes bigger than a kid 's whole hand . She made plain dinners but they were the kind of food a person always enjoys . Like just meat loaf from the recipe on the back of the oatmeal box , served with mashed potatoes , butter filling the little well in the middle , and some green beans from the can , all served on an embroidered tablecloth . Her sheets smelled like outside , and everybody used to say you could eat from her kitchen floor . I used to think , Why would you want to do that ? and I would imagine my uncle Harry sitting there cross-legged with his napkin tucked into his shirt , leaning over awkwardly to lift his scrambled eggs from the linoleum . Aunt Betty was a wild woman , that 's what she called herself . She told me she was engaged to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a lot of makeup and smoked constantly and painted her fingernails and toenails blood red . She and my uncle were very social , and I never saw anyone look as glamorous as she did when they went out . She would wake up her children for a meteor shower or a good sunrise , and she was always asking them to tell her things they learned in school ; she thought her children were wonderful . Every Sunday morning , she would make Monkey Bread , and there was always enough for everyone . My dad does n't want to visit my aunts anymore . I guess he has a new life now with my stepmother , Ginger , and the aunts just do n't figure in . Sometimes I get mail from them : a joke card from Betty ; a card with Jesus on it from Rose . They both call me Honey , which makes for an inside curl of pleasure . I thought I would always go and see them , every summer . Well , you never know what life will turn out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think of bad things that can happen and how much we can never know , and it 's so scary . It 's like taking the lid off a box that 's in front of you all the time , but usually you leave it alone . But every now and then , you take the lid off and you look in and the box is so dark and deep and full of writhing possibilities it gives you the shivers . I lean back against my bed , let out a big breath , and look around my bedroom . I am used to it now , which probably means it 's about time to move . Every time I get used to something , it 's time to leave it . " We have orders , " my father will say , and that 's that , we 're on the way to wherever the army tells us to go . I like this room . It feels more private than any place I 've ever had , situated the way it is at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with us , she would have gotten this room ; she always got the best room . But she lives by herself in California now , because she ran away when she was eighteen . We talk about twice a month , and once in a while she comes to visit , but mostly it is just no good between her and my father ; it never was . My father was always fierce , but after my mother died it seemed like he got a lot worse . And Diane finally just left . He never talks about it , but I know he is sorry . One thing my stepmother has done is to make my father a little softer , not so mean . It 's odd ; I think he loved my mother more , but he treats Ginger better . And I think I know why . It is because she is not as nice to him as my mother was . She pushes back , sometimes . She draws a line and says do n't you cross this . Now you tell me why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My favorite place in my room is my desk drawer . In it is a little figure of a bird all covered with jewels . I do n't think they 're real jewels , but maybe they are . It was given to me by a boy I did not know , for no reason . It was a while ago , just after my mother had died , and I was sitting out by myself in the middle of a field on a summer day , and the boy appeared out of nowhere . He was younger than I , I thought smaller , at least , and so I was n't afraid . I said , " Hey , " and he said nothing back . " What are you doing ? " I asked , and again he said nothing . I asked him if he spoke English , and he just smiled and shrugged . I stared at him for a while , and then I patted the ground . He sat next to me , his knees drawn up under his chin , and together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeds , the lazy shifting of the gigantic cumulus clouds that filled the sky that day , and , once , the magical hovering of a dragonfly , colored metallic blue . We only pointed at things , but it was a good conversation . We sat for a good fifteen or twenty minutes , and then the boy got up to leave . But first he took the bird out of his pocket and gave it to me . I was amazed by his generosity , but I am ashamed to say that I made no move at all to refuse that gift . It is the main thing in my drawer , because it was a miracle and it came without asking . Sometimes when I think of that boy , I think , Wait , was he mute ? And sometimes I think the thought very small and private Was he an angel ? And sometimes I think , in a way that makes me feel like bawling , Was he my mother ? That thought is the smallest and most private of all , and it lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone . Also in my drawer is a photo of baby pigs . I remember them vaguely from a time we lived on a farm in Indiana . I think I was three . I remember being barefoot , standing on the wooden rail of a fence , looking down at those pigs . I wanted them to be my dollies ; I wanted to wheel them in a carriage , put bonnets on their heads , feed them from bottles , and cover them when they slept . But they were not babies , they were pigs . So I only watched them lie by their mother in their neat , pink row ; and I watched them take their grunty little steps around the sty . I have some rocks I cracked open and kept for their gorgeous insides . I have some acorns , because look what comes from them . I have a pressed flower , a rose I would still call pink , even though its edges have turned tea-colored . I have pictures of beautiful things cut out of magazines : a willow tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning sun , a monarch on a red poppy , a herd of sheep on a hill in Ireland , a wooden , straight-back chair positioned by a window with a blowing white curtain . I have a lot of pictures of dogs , too . I would like to have seven dogs . I have something that I drew , a woman 's face that is full of sorrow . And it looks like a real picture that an artist did . It looks that way to me . And the thing is , I do n't know how to draw . I was sitting at my desk one day , my head in my hands , and I had that middle ache that is just the pain that comes with being alive sometimes , that kind of personal despair . I do n't know why it comes , but I know it used to get my mother too . Every once in a while , she would sit so still , her hands in her lap , and she would have a little smile on her face that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once asked , and she looked up quickly and she saw that I saw . After that , she would usually close herself in her bedroom until it was over it never took that long , really . She did n't like for anyone to see her that way . She did n't want anyone to know . But I had that same kind of feeling one day , that veil of sadness between me and the world , and I had a piece of paper in front of me and I drew that woman 's face like I was in a dream , like someone else was borrowing my hand . And I have never shown it to anyone , and I have never drawn anything good since then , either . Lately , I have begun writing a lot more poems , and I have been saving them in my drawer . And it 's funny , the same thing happens , about someone else borrowing my hand . I get a feeling ; I step off into space ; and a thing makes up itself . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the mark of her mouth on it . I have a rhinestone button I found outside , feathers from birds , pennies that mean good luck . I have a box of crayons that I intend never to use , I just like to look at them all perfect and read the names of the colors out loud , and I like to smell them deep , like I smell the test papers at school that have just come off the mimeograph machine . I have some torn-out hairdos that I would like to get , if my hair will ever grow really long instead of acting paralyzed . Sometimes I think , What if I died and someone looked in my drawer ? I wonder what they would understand about me . Probably not so much for one thing , they would get the crayons wrong . I think , actually , that none of us understands anyone else very well , because we 're all too shy to show what matters the most . If you ask me , it 's a major design flaw . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I am . I think it would be quite a relief .
