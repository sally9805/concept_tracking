<p> Katia Calderon went out with her sisters Saturday morning to buy notebooks and pens for the first day of school , which was supposed to begin today . That simple act of preparation saved the girls ' lives . But their home on the outskirts of San Salvador was one of 300 houses buried in a landslide caused by a 7.6 magnitude quake centered in El Salvador and felt throughout Central America . " My parents were in there . We have done everything possible to find them - with machines , with everything . But we have n't been able to find them yet , " says Katia , her teenage voice faltering . While the massive temblor has brought the nation together in rescue efforts marked by acts of solidarity and dedication , some Salvadorans are saying it was n't the quake but a landslide that caused the most deaths . And they 're angry with the government 's failure to take preventive measures . Environmentalists here say deforestation on the slopes of the Balsamo Mountains may have contributed to the landslide that buried Katia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts say that Salvador 's earthquake demonstrates once again what people learned in Venezuela 's devastating landslides in 1999 and across Central America in 1998 with hurricane Mitch - that disregard for the environment exacerbates whatever destructive wallop natural <p> phenomena like earthquakes and floods carry . Intense construction on Venezuela 's Caribbean coast , and hundreds of cases of disregard for established land-use restrictions - often with official complicity - led to one of South America 's worst disasters . More than 30,000 people perished in those mudslides . And with Mitch , loss of life and property damage in Honduras , Nicaragua , and El Salvador were much worse than it would have been because of heavy deforestation and uncontrolled construction in known risk zones . In both cases , corruption was an important culprit of the human suffering , just as environmentalists and other watchdog groups may find was a factor in Saturday 's landslides in El Salvador . " For years and years , we have been saying we have to protect the Balsamo Mountains , " says Ricardo Navarro , director of The Center for Appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth International . " We said there 's going to be a tremor , and it 's going to collapse , and that 's what happened . " Mr. Navarro 's group has filed cases before many different governmental entities to try to stop the deforestation and construction of homes there . But the desperate need for new housing and construction industry interests took precedence , he says . Saturday 's quake has claimed at least 400 lives , and Red Cross officials estimate another 1,200 people are still missing . But it 's not as devastating as the 1986 quake here that killed 1,500 , injured 20,000 , and left some 300,000 homeless . Currently , Las Colinas is the neighborhood where the rescue efforts are concentrated . Yesterday , a thousand rescue workers labored on the site where hundreds of homes lay buried beneath the rubble . Rescue workers labored all weekend , but mostly in vain . Sergio Moreno was one of the few survivors rescued . He was trapped under a beam in his home for more than 30 hours until late Sunday . Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens dug him out . His parents stood visibly anxious on a mound of earth nearby . " We 've been here since Saturday waiting to see if they can get our son out . We came here from Sonsonate after the earthquake . We imagined many things . But we never imagined our son would be trapped , " Juan Moreno said . Even with the multitude of workers and concerned citizens , the scene at the Las Colinas neighborhood was solemn and quiet , agitated only by the occasional tremors that continue to rattle the capital city and the nerves of its residents . Despite the intense efforts at Las Colinas and other areas around the country , some of the survivors are critical of how the government handled the earthquake . " The government 's aid took too long to get here to be able to excavate and get people out alive . If it was done with more urgency , many deaths would have been avoided , " says Victor Villanueva , who lives near the site of the Las Colinas landslide . <p> Navarro 's environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the government to court for the damage at Las Colinas . The immediate order of business in El Salvador is , of course , emergency intervention - reaching buried victims who may still be alive , attending to those left homeless , and reuniting separated families . But officials , including President Francisco Flores , must also be pursuing relief efforts with thoughts of medium- and long-term political and economic implications in the back of their minds . They know firsthand that natural disasters in this region prone to earthquakes , hurricanes , and volcanic eruption have a history of wreaking political upheaval and spawning social change . The 1972 Managua earthquake is generally considered a factor in the fall of Nicaragua 's Somoza regime to the Sandinista revolution in 1979 , for example , since it highlighted the military regime 's corruption and inefficiency . In a similar way , a massive earthquake in Guatemala in 1976 put El Salvador 's neighbor on the road to religious diversity , many historians say . The dominant Roman Catholic Church was perceived as slow to respond to Guatemalans ' human needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped in with assistance from grass-roots relief drives in churches outside Guatemala , many in the United States . As a result , many practical-minded Guatemalans considered conversion for the first time . More recently , hurricane Mitch in October 1998 worked as a catalyst for Central America 's economic and political integration . President Flores and his fellow Central American presidents also learned from Mitch the importance of the international media in opening the founts of relief assistance . Some foreign observers even accused the Central American leaders of inflating Mitch 's toll in a drive for international intervention . Mitch also instigated an emphasis on disaster prevention , a new concept in a region hampered by a strong belief in fate . But experts say too little progress is being made in institutionalizing preventive planning . Central America covers the meeting points of six tectonic plates , it counts more than two dozen active volcanoes , and its shores are vulnerable to tropical storms half the year . Mexico was one of the first countries to respond to El Salvador 's needs , sending tons of food , blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs specially trained in disaster relief . Accompanying the soldiers is the director of Mexico 's National Disaster Prevention Center , Oscar Navarro , who recently helped direct disaster-prevention efforts in response to the eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano outside Mexico City . If some Salvadorans are disenchanted by the government 's response , they have also been moved by the outpouring of support from fellow citizens and from abroad . Many neighbors brought their shovels and are helping to look for survivors , while others deliver plates of food to rescue workers . Salvadoran military members and workers from the construction industry drove earth movers and dump trucks . Once the situation in Guatemala - where the quake was also felt and claimed six lives - was stabilized , firemen from that neighboring country came to help . The US sent in teams of Army doctors and engineers who had been stationed in neighboring Honduras . Rescue workers continue to work around the clock to locate people like Katia 's parents .

They are worried about people they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors who have taken her and her siblings in . <p> Staff writer Howard LaFranchi in Mexico contributed to this story . <p> To send help : American Red Cross 1-800-HELP-NOW Spanish : 1-800-257-7575 <p> AmeriCares <p> 1-800-486-HELP <p> CARE <p> 1-800-422-7385 <p> World Relief 1-800-535-6565 <p> World Vision 1-888-511-6565 <p> Catholic Relief Services 1-800-235-2772 <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 .
