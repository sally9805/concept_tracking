You 're only 8 weeks away from your best ride ever .

" A 40k is a good training goal for any cyclist , " says Carmichael Training Systems expert-level coach Jason Tullous .

LT : Lactate Threshold Your LT is the point at which your breathing changes from a deep , rhythmic pattern to a fast , panic-like pattern . LT intervals should be performed just below this effort . Your perceived exertion should be about a 7 on a scale of 1-10 ( 10 being the highest ) , or about 85-89% maximum heart rate . MHR = Maximum Heart Rate Your MHR is the highest number of beats your heart can reach in an all-out effort . Do this field test to find your max : Hop onto your trainer for 15 minutes of moderately paced pedaling while maintaining a cadence of 75 rpm . Increase your effort by 10% by shitting into the next highest gear . Maintain this effort for 2 to 3 minutes while keeping your cadence at 75 rpm . Continue increasing your effort every 2 minutes until you ca n't go any harder . Then sprint all out for 10 seconds . The resulting number on your heart rate monitor is your MHR . VOsub 2 Max = Maximum Oxygen Consumption Your VOsub 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greater your VOsub 2 max , the greater your potential for excelling in endurance sports . Do these intervals as hard as possible , with a perceived effort of 10 out of 10 . Pay no attention to heart rate ; just ride till your eyes pop out . <p>
