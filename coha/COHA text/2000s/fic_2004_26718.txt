Betrayed and abandoned J. Edgar Hoover Building Washington , D.C. Monday , 26 January 1998 1050 Hours , Local Captain Mitch Vecchio sat in the reception area of the FBI headquarters looking at his watch . He had worn his TWA pilot 's uniform to the meeting both to impress the people he was about to meet and to save time . Vecchio had to be at Dulles for a listed flight and was hoping he had n't scheduled his time too tightly . His appointment with FBI Special Agent Glenn Wallace was n't until eleven o'clock , but Vecchio had hoped that by coming in a few minutes early he might get it pushed up . " Did you tell Agent Wallace I was here ? " Vecchio asked for the second time . The receptionist nodded but offered no further information . He had called the FBI earlier that morning after thinking it over for several months . He knew that they 'd be asking why it took him so long to come forward , but he was n't entirely sure himself . It had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London . When he was changing out of his uniform in the pilots ' lounge , he noticed a poster on the bulletin board near the lockers . It was an international BOLO notice , distributed by the FBI , Interpol , and various other lawenforcement agencies alerting one another , all border checkpoints , transportation authorities , and local law enforcement to " be on the lookout " for fugitives wanted because of their involvement in serious crimes . In his years as an airline pilot , Mitch Vecchio had seen dozens of these bulletins hanging in briefing rooms and airport offices-and had never given them more than a cursory glance . But this time Vecchio was stunned to recognize the picture on the poster . The " criminal " being sought was someone he knew . The caption beneath the photograph stated that the fugitive 's name was Gilbert Duncan , an Irish terrorist wanted by Interpol for placing a bomb on a UN airplane in March of 1995 , causing it to explode over Iraq , killing all aboard . Mitch vaguely remembered something in the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UN plane . But that was n't what had caught his attention . Mitch Vecchio knew for certain that the " terrorist " in the photo was not Gilbert Duncan . He was Pete Newman , the husband of a former TWA flight attendant . And the reason he knew it was her husband was because he had seen the photo in her wallet-the wallet she left on the dresser on the occasions when they shared a hotel room . Vecchio recalled when Rachel Newman came to him to break off their yearlong affair . It was right after she " got religion . " He had thought she 'd get over the religion thing and come back to him-at least he 'd hoped she would . But Rachel disappeared shortly after that , and Vecchio had n't seen Rachel or her husband since-almost three years now . Mitch remembered driving by the Newmans ' Falls Church , Virginia , home one Sunday , a month or two after he 'd seen Rachel for the last time . He was surprised that there was a For Sale sign out front and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , went in and met the realtor , and asked discreetly about the reason the couple was selling their house . The real estate agent shrugged and said , " I 'm not sure what happened . I 'm told that there was a death in the family and a sister from out of town is selling the house . " As he drove away from the Newman 's home , Vecchio 's imagination played that information over and over . At first he wondered if Pete Newman had discovered his affair with Rachel , maybe even killed his wife in a jealous rage . But no , Mitch would have read about such a thing in the papers . Then he thought maybe Rachel had killed herself because she felt such guilt and remorse about dumping him . His ego liked that theory , but even he had to admit that it was n't anymore likely than the first idea . Mitch was troubled to think that , in either case , Rachel might be the one who was dead . He had wondered about the Newmans , off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he saw that poster that he began to put things together . An FBI agent interrupted the pilot 's reverie . " Captain Vecchio ? I 'm Special Agent Glenn Wallace . Would you like to come with me into a conference room where we can talk ? " " Hi ... Mitch Vecchio ... glad to meet you . " He stood and shook Agent Wallace 's hand . Mitch followed him into a nearby room where the two chose adjoining seats at the end of a long , oval table . " You said when you called that you had some information regarding an international fugitive who 's wanted for murder and terrorist acts ? " Vecchio nodded . " But you 've got the wrong name on the wanted poster . He 's not Irish , he 's American , " he said . " And I do n't believe he 's a terrorist . " Agent Wallace looked up from his legal pad . " Just who are we talking about ? " " The guy you 're calling Gilbert Duncan . He 's not Irish-I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His name is Peter Newman . He lived in Falls Church until a couple years ago . I-I was ... uh ... a close friend , I mean ... a coworker , with his wife . I think her husband was a Marine major or colonel-something like that - and he worked at the White House . I do remember that . She told me a little about him but not all that much . I got the idea that her husband 's work was secret or classified or whatever . " The FBI agent was giving the pilot his full attention now . " Go on . " " Well , no ... that 's it . That 's all I know . Gilbert Duncan is Peter Newman . I mean Pete Newman is Duncan . Duncan 's not his real name , and he 's not an Irish national . I just thought you ought to know . " Agent Wallace was not content with such sketchy information . And he was savvy enough to recognize in the pilot 's stammer that there was likely a good bit more to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his uniform sleeve and pulled him back into the chair . " Just a minute , Captain Vecchio . I have a few more questions about this matter , but I need to check on something first . Can you give me a few minutes ? " " Uh , well , I 've got a flight at three o'clock this afternoon out of Dulles . How long will this take ? " Vecchio was beginning to regret having come . " Not long at all . Wait here . I 'll be right back . " Agent Wallace spoke the words like an order and not a request ; then he rose and left the conference room by a back door . * * * Special Agent Glenn Wallace hated walk-in duty . Every junior and midgrade agent assigned to the Hoover Building had to stand a shift of this duty a couple of times a year . In addition to doing their regular jobs , the younger agents were required to spend a day responding to inquiries and taking down information brought to them by any citizen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakroom chatter : people talking about receiving covert messages through fillings in their molars , reports of alien abductions ... you name it , and you were likely to hear it on walk-in duty . Outside the back door of the conference room , Agent Wallace went to a computer terminal reserved for the duty officer 's use and typed the names Peter Newman and Gilbert Duncan into the Search field . There was a brief pause while the computer crunched information from a server located far off in the mountains of West Virginia . Suddenly , the borders of the display on the monitor turned red , and a box appeared in the center of the screen : RESTRICTED DATA ACCESS DENIED An instant later , a phone next to the computer terminal rang . " Special Agent Glenn Wallace . " He listened . " No sir , it was in response to information from a walk-in . " He listened some more . " Yes , sir . " Wallace hung up the phone , clicked Exit on the computer screen , and grimaced . Just my luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my watch . You 'd think he was coming in here claiming to know the identity of the shooter on the grassy knoll . Whatever he said , the FBI head shed went nuts . Sounds like I 'll be writing this one up for weeks . Agent Wallace walked back into the room where Mitch Vecchio sat with a sheen of sweat on his forehead . He looked as if he had n't moved . " Mr. Vecchio , I think you 'd better make a call to whoever it is you report to because it 's quite likely you are n't going to make your flight this afternoon . " " Wh-why is that ? " " We need some more information on this Peter Newman or , rather , Gilbert Duncan character . You can use the phone at the reception desk . I 'll be right here , waiting . " The airline captain had a sick look on his face . He got up out of the chair and walked slowly toward the reception area . A minute or so later , he came back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width of the conference table between himself and Agent Wallace . " Why do n't we start at the beginning and you tell me how it is you know this person ? " Wallace turned to a fresh sheet of paper and leaned forward , staring in anticipation of Vecchio 's answer . Almost two hours and nine pages of legal tablet later , Special Agent Glenn Wallace leaned back in his chair and looked Vecchio squarely in the eye . " Now ... what I want to know is for how long you and Newman 's wife were having this affair . " Vecchio slumped back in the chair , and his mouth dropped open . Wallace knew he had him ; Mitch Vecchio was ready to tell the FBI anything they wanted to know . Office of Foreign Missions FBI Liaison Office U.S. Department of State Washington , D.C. Thursday , 29 January 1998 1935 Hours , Local Three days after Agent Glenn Wallace in D.C. started the file on Peter Newman following his interview with Mitch Vecchio , FBI Agent Robert Hallstrom , a twenty-one-year veteran , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the other people in his section had left for the day . The Newman file had been forwarded to the FBI 's Counter-Terrorism Office in New York and on to the FBI Counter-Terrorism Liaison Office at the State Department . Wallace had poked around some more , trying to learn about Gilbert Duncan , aka Peter Newman . The young agent had done a little more digging in the Bureau 's main Criminal Index files and in LexisNexis , but after running into various firewalls he gave up and submitted what he considered to be a rather cursory report to his superiors . Within a day , Wallace was busy again with his regular cases ; the so-called terrorist with dual identities was forgotten . The file languished in an overflowing electronic in-box for only twenty-four hours before an FBI computer analyst entered it , without comment , into the FBI 's Counter-Terrorism database . And now , only eighty-one hours after Mitch Vecchio had walked into the Hoover Building , FBI Senior Special Agent Robert Hallstrom was reading the file . The reason Hallstrom was working late had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallstrom was a Russian mole . He 'd started spying for the Soviet Committee on State Security-the KGB-in 1979 , when Russia was still part of the Soviet Union . At the time , Hallstrom had some serious financial problems and decided selling secrets might prove both financially lucrative and intellectually challenging . The KGB recruited Bob Hallstrom only four years after he joined the Bureau in ' 75 . The fledgling spy had begun his espionage career audaciously . Because he was familiar with U.S. counter-espionage techniques , Hallstrom refused to identify himself to the Russians , other than the fact that he worked for an American intelligence organization . Using the alias Julio Morales , Hallstrom had written to the home address of a Russian GRU agent operating undercover as a UN diplomat in New York . He told the Russian to deliver a sealed envelope personally to the KGB . The GRU agent 's home address was covered by diplomatic immunity ; his mail would n't be intercepted and read by FBI " flaps and seals " technicians . Also , by keeping the Russians in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallstrom was confident he could effectively eliminate any risk of getting caught by his Bureau colleagues . The KGB officer who opened Hallstrom 's letter was Major Dimitri Komulakov . Hallstrom had found his name on a list of Russian diplomats that the FBI suspected of spying for the KGB . Komulakov was indeed a rising star in the Soviet intelligence apparat , having been awarded the Order of Lenin for his spycraft and overseas work , especially in the United States . In 1979 , when Hallstrom first wrote to him , Komulakov was assigned to the Russian Embassy in Washington as a cultural and trade attach . The first package of secrets that Hallstrom delivered to Komulakov immediately caught the eye of the KGB hierarchy at Moscow Center . And over time , Komulakov earned ever-higher accolades from his Moscow superiors for the quality of intelligence that Hallstrom was sending them . Komulakov 's career had spiraled ever upward after that . Hallstrom 's first package , to prove his capability and sincerity , contained volatile information . He gave the Russians the names of Soviet military officers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also betrayed other American spies overseas , and the Russians , thoroughly impressed , left huge sums of U.S. currency at his designated dead drops . In the ensuing years , Hallstrom sent the KGB hundreds of packages of national security secrets , including reams of classified documents and countless computer disks with volumes of data about U.S. weapons , military equipment , covert military plans , and details about intelligence operations including the names of the U.S. and foreign national personnel involved . From time to time , Hallstrom would hear about agents who were killed or captured-agents he had betrayed-but the KGB 's mole never accepted personal responsibility for their deaths . " It 's a mean business , " he would tell himself . " They knew the risk . People are bound to get hurt . " Hallstrom was promoted several times , not so much for his proficient FBI work but simply due to his seniority with the Bureau or because some superior in his then-current position grew tired or irritated at Hallstrom 's odd personality and habits and had him " promoted " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironically , each time the spy was moved , it was to another sensitive area . This gave Hallstrom access and opportunities to compromise more and more of his nation 's most sensitive secrets-secrets ranging ever wider in scope and intelligence value . by 1997 , Hallstrom was one of the FBI 's most senior counter-terrorism agents , with access to information and materials from other U.S. intelligence agencies as well .
