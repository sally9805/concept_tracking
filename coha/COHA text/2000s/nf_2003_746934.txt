Freshwater aquaculture is one of the fastest growing sectors of the U.S. agricultural economy , and channel catfish production accounts for 70 percent of all freshwater aquaculture earnings . The National Agricultural Statistics Service estimates that the 2001 farmgate revenue for channel catfish was about $470 million . <p> Unfortunately , as much as 60 percent of farm-raised catfish is considered off-flavor at certain times , according to a recent American Fisheries Society study . These off-flavors can lead to delays in harvesting and result in economic losses of up to 20 percent of total farmgate value . Scientists with the Agricultural Research Service are looking for ways to detect and prevent such problems . Detecting Off-Flavors <p> Channel catfish are raised in densely populated ponds , where algae and bacteria thrive on the large amounts of nutrients that are available . While most of these algal species are either beneficial or nonharmful , a few produce off-flavor compounds . <p> " Fish can be rejected for flavors that are described as woody , sewage , rotten , and diesel , " says Casey Grimm , an analytical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( FPSQU ) at the Southern Regional Research Center in New Orleans , Louisiana . " But the basis for about 80 percent of all rejections is the muddy/ musty aroma produced by geosmin and 2-methyl-isoborneol ( 2-MIB ) . " <p> Human taste buds are incredibly sensitive to these two compounds . The average consumer can detect 0.7 parts per billion ( ppb ) , and a skilled , professional catfish taster can detect 0.1 ppb in catfish . But these pros are susceptible to colds , allergies , and other problems that impair their smelling and tasting abilities and desensitize them to off-flavors . <p> To make detection of catfish flavors more efficient , Grimm began developing an instrument method in 1997 for analyzing off-flavor compounds . He and his collaborators , including support scientist Steve Lloyd , created a technique that uses steam distillation/solid-phase microextraction to collect flavor compounds and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to separate and analyze them . <p> The instrument is more objective than human flavor checkers and could help standardize the catfish industry . It can run an analysis every 15 minutes , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " At a cost of $100,000 per instrument , it 's probably too expensive for small producers , " says Grimm . " But the state of Mississippi is looking into buying one or more machines and setting up laboratories that could be used by producers from around the region . " Getting to the Source <p> Detecting off-flavors before they cross the human taste threshold solves only part of the problem . Ultimately , ARS researchers would like to control off-flavor algae or prevent them from forming these compounds . They have begun looking more closely at the biology of the cyanobacteria  --  commonly called blue-green algae  --  and other species that are the sources of geosmin , 2-MIB , and other off-flavor compounds . <p> Paul Zimba , a microbiologist at ARS ' Catfish Genetics Research Unit in Stoneville , Mississippi , estimates that between 100 and 200 species of cyanobacteria live in catfish production ponds . But , he says , only four or five of these species are known to produce off-flavor compounds . The rest are beneficial because they oxygenate the water . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catfish industry  --  the multiple-batch system  --  may contribute significantly to the growth of off-flavors . In this arrangement , hatched fish eggs , or sac fry , are reared in nursery ponds . Once they reach the adolescent , or fingerling , stage , they are moved to production ponds , where they grow to market size . <p> Farmers harvest the full-grown fish and restock the ponds with more fingerlings , meaning that several different ages of catfish are present in a pond at any one time . The restocking process can continue for several years without the ponds being drained . There is no industry standard designating how often ponds should be drained . <p> Recently , Zimba and colleagues studied how the age of a catfish production pond related to its water quality , phytoplankton and zooplankton populations , and incidence of off-flavor . They examined 71 catfish production ponds in Mississippi during the hottest part of the summer , when algal and cyanobacterial levels are at their highest . The ponds included in the study were 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not surprisingly , the researchers found that fish from younger ponds had lower incidences and intensities of off-flavors than those from older ponds . Zimba says that draining production ponds every 4 to 5 years could decrease occurrence of off-flavors . <p> Zimba and his collaborators also outlined a basic succession pattern of zooplankton and phytoplankton that grow in catfish production ponds . Among other things , they determined that by year 4 , blue-green algae are dominant and continue to increase through year 15 . Older ponds also contain higher densities of zooplankton . <p> Because higher levels of blue-green algae correlate with higher levels of off-flavors , Zimba and the other researchers say that older ponds may be used for holding sac fry and fingerlings . The zooplankton in these ponds could serve as food sources for the fry . Younger ponds are better suited to growing out the fish and purging them of off-flavors . <p> Normally , farmers must keep off-flavor fish in the production pond or in another holding facility for weeks or months until the flavors dissipate . This holding period can come at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a way to speed up the time it takes fish to eliminate off-flavor compounds . He used freshwater raceway systems to measure how much time was required for fish to eliminate off-flavor . <p> " Fresh water is pumped through the raceways to flush out the off-flavors acquired by the fish from the pond system , " Zimba explains . " Off-flavor concentrations in the fish gradually lessen as the water flows over them . In our studies , fish purged 50 percent of off-flavors within 24 hours . " Charting Microbes ' Succession <p> Though Zimba and his collaborators have made great strides in charting the year-to-year biological succession of various microorganisms in a channel catfish pond , the details are still a little unclear . As a result , the incidence of off-flavor compounds such as 2-MIB and geosmin remains unpredictable . <p> According to FPSQU chemist Barry Hurlburt , this unpredictability may not be a problem much longer . During the past 2 years , he and his collaborators have developed a molecular assay that can scan a catfish pond and , in less than a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains . Over the next year , they will use this assay to test 30 production ponds once a week and note which species each contains . They will use this data to map the biological succession of the algae and bacteria . <p> Hurlburt says , " If a certain species always blooms at a certain time before an off-flavor-causing species appears , the assay could be used as a predictive tool by farmers . If their ponds tested positive for a ' 3-week predictor species , ' for instance , they would know exactly how much time they have to salvage their fish before off-flavor compounds begin ruining their crop . " <p> In a similar preventive effort , Zimba and Steven J. Thomson , an agricultural engineer at ARS ' Application and Production Technology Research Unit in Stoneville , are studying a remote-sensing technique that may detect unwanted algal species in production ponds before the problem gets out of hand . <p> The researchers can now identify specific types of algae by their unique color profiles , which they obtain from digital video shot during low-altitude flights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chlorophyll and carotenoid compounds . With enough data , the scientists can predict when certain types of algae will grow in the cycle . <p> The Stoneville researchers and colleagues at Mississippi State University 's Remote Sensing Technologies Center and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are currently refining their equipment and technique . A Solution Could Be in the Genes <p> Besides looking at biological succession in production ponds , ARS scientists are also studying the genes that cause geosmin and 2-MIB to form . Hurlburt explains , " A researcher in England has isolated the gene responsible for the first step in the biosynthesis of geosmin from the soil-dwelling bacterium Streptomyces coelicor . I plan on using this cloned gene in an attempt to isolate the equivalent gene in cyanobacteria . " <p> Hurlburt and his collaborators may eventually be able to use this information to block the biosynthetic pathway that allows geosmin to form in ponds . <p> Hurlburt is also planning on using a genetic approach to " knock out " genes in cyanobacterial species involved in-off-flavor compound production . If any of them stop the synthesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species and introduce them into research production ponds . He will then determine whether the improved species can compete with and eventually displace the off-flavor-causing species . <p> All these efforts may ultimately lead to more productive and profitable commercial catfish ponds . <p> This research is part of Aquaculture , an ARS National Program ( #106 ) described on the World Wide Web at www.nps.ars.gov . <p> Paul V.
