A Series of Unfortunate Events : The Reptile Room Movie Tie-in Edition Chapter One The stretch of road that leads out of the city , past Hazy Harbor and into the town of Tedia , is perhaps the most unpleasant in the world . It is called Lousy Lane . Lousy Lane runs through fields that are a sickly gray color , in which a handful of scraggly trees produce apples so sour that one only has to look at them to feel ill . Lousy Lane traverses the Grim River , a body of water that is nine-tenths mud and that contains extremely unnerving fish , and it encircles a horseradish factory , so the entire area smells bitter and strong . I am sorry to tell you that this story begins with the Baudelaire orphans traveling along this most displeasing road , and that from this moment on , the story only gets worse . Of all the people in the world who have miserable lives-and , as I 'm sure you know , there are quite a few-the Baudelaire youngsters take the cake , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them than just about anybody . Their misfortune began with an enormous fire that destroyed their home and killed both their loving parents , which is enough sadness to last anyone a lifetime , but in the case of these three children it was only the bad beginning . After the fire , the siblings were sent to live with a distant relative named Count Olaf , a terrible and greedy man . The Baudelaire parents had left behind an enormous fortune , which would go to the children when Violet came of age , and Count Olaf was so obsessed with getting his filthy hands on the money that he hatched a devious plan that gives me nightmares to this day . He was caught just in time , but he escaped and vowed to get ahold of the Baudelaire fortune sometime in the future . Violet , Klaus , and Sunny still had nightmares about Count Olaf 's shiny , shiny eyes , and about his one scraggly eyebrow , and most of all about the tattoo of an eye he had on his ankle . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . So I must tell you that if you have opened this book in the hope of finding out that the children lived happily ever after , you might as well shut it and read something else . Because Violet , Klaus , and Sunny , sitting in a small , cramped car and staring out the windows at Lousy Lane , were heading toward even more misery and woe . The Grim River and the horseradish factory were only the first of a sequence of tragic and unpleasant episodes that bring a frown to my face and a tear to my eye whenever I think about them . The driver of the car was Mr. Poe , a family friend who worked at a bank and always had a cough . He was in charge of overseeing the orphans ' affairs , so it was he who decided that the children would be placed in the care of a distant relative in the country after all the unpleasantness with Count Olaf . " I 'm sorry if you 're uncomfortable , " Mr. Poe said , coughing into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't fit too many people . We could n't even fit any of your suitcases . In a week or so I 'll drive back here and bring them to you . " " Thank you , " said Violet , who at fourteen was the oldest of the Baudelaire children . Anyone who knew Violet well could see that her mind was not really on what Mr. Poe was saying , because her long hair was tied up in a ribbon to keep it out of her eyes . Violet was an inventor , and when she was thinking up inventions she liked to tie her hair up this way . It helped her think clearly about the various gears , wires , and ropes involved in most of her creations . " After living so long in the city , " Mr. Poe continued , " I think you will find the countryside to be a pleasant change . Oh , here is the turn . We 're almost there .

Klaus loved to read , and at approximately twelve years of age had read more books than many people read in their whole lives . Sometimes he read well into the night , and in the morning could be found fast asleep , with a book in his hand and his glasses still on . " I think you 'll like Dr. Montgomery , too , " Mr. Poe said . " He has traveled a great deal , so he has plenty of stories to tell . I 've heard his house is filled with things he 's brought from all the places he 's been . " " Bax ! " Sunny shrieked . Sunny , the youngest of the Baudelaire orphans , often talked like this , as infants tend to do . In fact , besides biting things with her four very sharp teeth , speaking in fragments was how Sunny spent most of her time . It was often difficult to tell what she meant to say . At this moment she probably meant something along the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All three children were . " How exactly is Dr. Montgomery related to us ? " Klaus asked . " Dr. Montgomery is-let me see-your late father 's cousin 's wife 's brother . I think that 's right . He 's a scientist of some sort , and receives a great deal of money from the government . " As a banker , Mr. Poe was always interested in money . " What should we call him ? " Klaus asked . " You should call him Dr. Montgomery , " Mr. Poe replied , " unless he tells you to call him Montgomery . Both his first and last names are Montgomery , so it does n't really make much difference . " " His name is Montgomery Montgomery ? " Klaus said , smiling . " Yes , and I 'm sure he 's very sensitive about that , so do n't ridicule him , " Mr. Poe said , coughing again into his handkerchief . " ' Ridicule ' means ' tease . ' " Klaus sighed .
