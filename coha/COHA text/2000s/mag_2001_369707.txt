A teenager 's sexual awakening creates tension between her and her secret-keeping , young single mother : it 's like Gilmore Girls done as domestic drama . This quiet story , based on Elizabeth Strout 's novel , might never have aired without Winfrey 's name . That may be why the film ramps up the melodrama ; between the moody imagery and eerie music , you 'd think you were watching a ' 70s horror flick . But the understated leads shine . Elisabeth Shue brings out mom Isabelle 's repression without turning her into a mere set of conventions ; Hanna Hall plays Amy with a subtle concupiscence that recalls her previous movie , The Virgin Suicides . Amy 's adapters should rent it sometime . <P>  --  J.P .
