<p> America is exporting more jobs , and its companies are selling fewer cars . But if there is a fight for market share in love and marriage , our brand is winning . <p> When Frank Sinatra sang about love and marriage going together like a horse and carriage , he might not have considered that much of the world puts the cart before the ox . Marriages are arranged by parents in China , India and Indonesia  --  three countries with 40% of the world 's population  --  plus others that practice Buddhism , Islam and Hinduism . Couples do n't date . They may get a 15-minute meeting followed in a few months by a wedding . <p> Love ? It evolves over time . <p> But sparks are flying , and love marriages are breaking out in India , the world 's largest democracy , with 1.1 billion people . Software developers Satya Ravada and Geeta Rani , both 30 , were working long hours on a project in Hyderabad , India , three years ago for Sierra Atlantic , a Fremont , Calif. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . <p> Friendship blossomed into love , and Ravada and Rani got married last year . Americans would hardly consider that unusual . But to Indians , it 's much more typical when people get engaged and married on the basis of a 15-minute meeting , or as little as a photo and a phone conversation . <p> The couple are part of a growing love-before-marriage trend that began slowly in the 1970s and 1980s , built a little steam with India 's economic reforms in 1991 under then-prime minister Narasimha Rao , then took off with the software boom of the late 1990s that brought the global economy into India 's insulated society . <p> The Indian government does not differentiate in its marriage statistics . But young Indians interviewed say their observations suggest that 10% to 20% of their friends are having love marriages , and expert Poonam Barua , director of the Conference Board 's India Operations , says that is probably true in most of India 's cities . <p> Several forces are at play , and as the giant exporter of jobs and culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian TV has been invaded by shows such as Friends and Oprah . Playboy magazine said last month that it will publish an Indian edition featuring Indian models . Indian soap operas are rife with secret love affairs . Bollywood movies such as Salaam Namaste borrow heavily from the age-old formula in which boy meets girl , they ca n't stand each other , then they fall in love . <p> Khushboo , a famous one-name Indian film star and TV game show host , sparked demonstrations last year when she said Indians should no longer expect brides to be virgins . More and more are n't . Twenty-five percent of women ages 18 to 30 in 11 major cities including tech centers Bangalore , Chennai , Mumbai and New Delhi have had premarital sex , according to an India Today magazine survey . <p> As influential , perhaps , is job outsourcing . The number of information-technology jobs U.S. companies outsource to other countries is approaching 500,000 , according to outsourcing consultancy neoIT . India aims to challenge China in manufacturing , and General Motors and Dell recently announced they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> U.S. companies bring with them American-style workplace diversity , which puts men and women in neighboring cubicles . Americans know what that leads to : Half of U.S. workers have dated a co-worker , according to an annual Valentine 's Day office romance survey by CareerBuilder.com ( which is part-owned by USA TODAY parent Gannett ) . <p> Entry-level IT workers in India often start at more than $6,000 a year , neoIT says . While low by U.S. standards , many Indians in their 20s are out-earning their parents . That chips away at parental influence , which is so important in India that Sierra Atlantic invites Indian parents to job interviews to OK the hiring of their children . <p> Many of India 's financially independent young adults are women . One-third of those Sierra Atlantic hired in 2005 were women , and the company expects women to be half of its new hires within a few years . Still , CEO Raju Reddy , himself in an arranged marriage to childhood friend Neeraja , was surprised to learn at the Sierra Atlantic holiday party in December that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the 13-year-old company . <p> A diverging path <p> Ravada was on the traditional path . His parents were looking for his bride . But Ravada found himself stuck in indecision as he met and rejected a string of girls after 15-minute meetings . That gave him what he says was a " bad complex , " because the girls seemed perfectly fine , and he knew he was hurting their feelings with his rejections . He asked his parents to delay their search while he buried himself in work that kept him in the office until nearly midnight . There , too , was Rani , and the two often waited late for phone calls from project managers waking up in California . <p> Love is gastronomically blind , and Ravada , whose caste members are strictly vegetarian , fell in love with Rani , whose caste members eat meat . That alone would have made an arranged marriage impossible . <p> Horoscopes also play a big role , but Rani says her parents are " liberal " and wanted her married to someone who would make her happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marrying complete strangers to be implausible . But even Indians in love marriages defend arranged marriages as proper and successful . They point to U.S. divorce courts full of head-over-heels lovers who found that courtships proved meaningless in the long run . Three-quarters of a million American children see their parents divorce each year . <p> Barua said she recently visited a call center in New Delhi where phone calls from U.S. consumers were being answered . Barua sat with a group of young women in the lunchroom . They all worked late and enjoyed being around young men , but had no desire to fall in love before a wedding . " They all wanted an arranged marriage , " Barua says . <p> Indians say parents might not be perfect at selecting mates , but they are better at it than hormone-crazed youths . If divorce is no longer as rare in India , love marriages are largely to blame , they say . <p> " All my family members had arranged marriages , no complaints , " Rani said . " They are very happy . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married and fall in love . " <p> It will be decades , if ever , before love marriages dominate worldwide . Even in India , the trend is specific to the middle class of 350 million , not to the 70% of the country that remains rural . But the trend is undeniable , says Barua , whose niece began a love marriage on Feb. 2 with an Indian working for Citibank . <p> Few Indian families would force a marriage on a child these days , but it is still common that the couple have no more than 15 or 20 minutes together to make the decision . In arranged marriages , the man is usually three to six years older than the woman , but can be decades older if the woman is considered unattractive or has a tarnished reputation . If the woman is good-looking , then the boy had better have promising prospects . Dowries paid by the brides ' families are officially illegal in India , but still common , and attractive daughters save their parents a lot of money . <p> There are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parental job more important to Indians than finding their children a life mate . It includes an elaborate vetting process to uncover anything unsavory before it is too late . <p> Checking things out <p> Kishor Uprety , a Nepalese senior lawyer at the World Bank who lives near Washington , D.C. , has been in an arranged marriage for two decades . He says the entire extended family becomes involved in doing background checks , leaving no stone unturned . He laughingly compares it to how journalists uncover dirt about U.S. presidential candidates . <p> Crucial are astrology clerics , who must certify compatibility and predict the marriage 's future . Deloitte Consulting India analysts Anil Chandra Chambravalli , a Gemini , and Leena Dinesh Mishra , a Capricorn , met on the job in August 2004 . They began a love marriage nine months later but say they probably would not have gotten married had their stars been out of alignment . <p> Even Indians who fall in love first will unlikely get married without parental approval . That can take months of cajoling , especially if the lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The parents of Kalyana Chekravarthy Kolouju objected when he told them he wanted to marry senior software engineer Priya Suhani Chinthakayala . The two met at Sierra Atlantic 's Global Development Center in Hyderabad and are now working on a project at a Trane site in La Crosse , Wis . Kolouju , 27 , and Chinthakayala , 25 , are from different castes , the complex societal order that separates families based loosely on the professions of their ancestors . While it 's supposed to be a pecking order , no caste admits to being inferior because they all feel superior to the others , Chinthakayala said . <p> Chinthakayala made a poor impression with Kolouju 's parents when they learned that she did not cook , but the marriage was finally approved when she assured them that she would be a proper daughter-in-law and take care of them in their old age . <p> Nepal , which borders on India , is also seeing more love marriages , Uprety says . He says almost all marriages in Nepal were arranged when he was wed in 1987 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a law student in Paris ; she lived in Katmandu . <p> As they approach their 20th anniversary , they do n't really know when they finally fell in love . The definition of love is different in every society , Anita says , but in all of them , " Love is a work in progress . " <p> Chinthakayala , who had to plead with Kolouju 's parents for months before they would agree to a love marriage , will go the traditional route when their 8-month-old son grows into his 20s . <p> " I would n't want him to make a wrong decision , " Chinthakayala says , and she would not hesitate to say no to any girl that seemed a mistake . Chinthakayala believes that her son will respect that , a sign , perhaps , that American ways have not taken over entirely . <p> The Upretys are raising two children in the Washington , D.C. , suburbs , 16-year-old son Kshitiz and 9-year-old daughter Aastha . They will likely find someone to marry on their own , but Kishor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they find it sad that many Americans wind up alone . In the USA , 14% of men and 10% of women between the ages of 40 and 54 have never been married , according to Census data . <p> Likewise , Chambravalli and Mishra say if they have children , they also will be allowed to search for true love . In the meantime , Mom and Dad will be on the lookout . <p> " Plan A and Plan B , " Mishra says .
