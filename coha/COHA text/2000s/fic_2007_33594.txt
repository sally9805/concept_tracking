" I 'm going to carve out his lying tongue , " Lady Portia Derring bit out as she surveyed the stretch of empty road nestled among thick , spiny gorse and rocky hills , desperate to catch a glimpse of her errant driver . An icy wind pulled at her bonnet . Her fingers , stiff and aching from the cold , clung to the frayed ribbons dangling beneath her chin . Even horribly out of fashion , the straw confection was her best bonnet and she was n't inclined to lose it . " Looking out that window again ? " Nettie asked . Falling back against the seat , Portia heaved a sigh and announced , " We 're stranded . John 's not coming back . " " He 'll be back , " her maid replied with a decided lack of worry as she stretched her generous curves along the threadbare squabs . " Take a nap . " Portia frowned at Nettie . " And let highwaymen take us unaware ? Splendid idea , that . " Nettie yawned widely , offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . She closed and opened her mouth several times with a vulgar smacking sound before adding , " What 's got your nose out of joint ? " Portia gestured about them at the motionless carriage , a feeling of frustration sweeping over her . " In case you failed to notice , we 've been abandoned by our sot of a driver . " She nodded to thewindow where the sky deepened to a smoky purple . " I do n't relish the idea of spending the night in this rickety carriage . " Nettie lifted a reddish brow and glanced out the window . Portia followed her gaze , eyeing the craggy limestone terrain , then the dark clouds scuttling across the sky , distracted at the sight of such raw beauty . Miles away from civilization . From family and words like duty , responsibility-marriage . Her heart lifted , her precarious situation suddenly not feeling so calamitous . The invisible band about her chest loosened , allowing her to take her first easy breath in years . Nettie clucked her tongue . " You really did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all the way out here . " Portia flicked a piece of lint off her blue merino skirt and stifled the retort that burned on her tongue . " I do n't know what you mean , " she lied . " I 've done nothing . Nothing at all . " " Nothin ' , " her cheeky maid snorted . " That 's about the gist of it . Five years of nothin ' . Well , your time 's run out . " She nodded as though pleased . " I heard what your grandmother said . " " Listening at keyholes again ? " Portia accused . " Either you choose or they will . And if you ask me , they should have put an end to your contrary ways long ago . " " No one 's asking you , " Portia snapped . Shrugging , the round-cheeked maid looked out the window again , granting Portia a meager moment of peace before demanding , " Ai n't there rich enough nabobs in Town ? Hardly seems possible any swell lives in this godforsaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glare at her in a way that left no doubt whom she held responsible for their ejection from Town . " Tell me we 're at least almost there . " " John did n't say , but we must be near . " Not that her driver had said much before staggering down the road , his vow to return within the hour echoing hollowly even then . Especially when issued through gin-laced breath . " I should have taken the mail coach , " she muttered . Not that Grandmother would have permitted such a thing . A Derring never resorted to public transport . No matter how desperate . There were appearances to be kept , after all . A Derring must not appear destitute . Even if they happened to be . " Bet you wish you 'd chosen one of those swells back in Town now , eh ? " Portia stifled a grimace and looked out the window again , careful not to reveal her decided lack of regret . What was one suitor to fend off when she was accustomed to the dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through parted frayed curtains . The sight of the bleak land , both majestic and deprived , wild with gorse and wind-ruffled heather , washed over her like a balm to the soul . It stirred something deep inside her-in a hidden , secret place that had n't felt anything in years . The moor was a far cry from the drawing rooms of the ton and she was heartily glad for it . " Not especially , " she replied , inhaling clean air kissed by the lips of a vanishing winter . A chance to get away was a rare treat , a much appreciated holiday . Especially when her greatest wish was to travel , to taste the freedom and adventure her mother experienced everyday . Being forced to entertain the attentions of a new suitor did n't matter much . Not when it meant escape from the tedium of another Season , from the auction block , from her family 's nagging . From a pervading sense of isolation-of holding her breath and waiting , watching , searching every room with senseless hope filling her chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to depart for lands unknown . The hot breath of ruin did n't reach so far as Italy , Greece , Spain , or whichever country her mother currently called home . Portia closed her eyes in one long blink and did her best to shake off the fetters of her world , to let the irons drop and pretend that this was a holiday of her own choosing and not just another foisted courtship . " Enough of this , " Portia announced , arranging her bonnet and repositioning her hatpin through the straw with a determined twist . " Where you off to ? " " To find help . " Portia grasped the latch and pushed the door open . Like an animal lying in wait , the wind attacked the door , whipping it inward again . She caught it with the palm of her hand and pushed , grunting . " Someone must . We ca n't rely on John . " Gathering her skirts in one hand , she added , " You 're welcome to come . A brisk walk might energize you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's warm and dry , thank you very much . " With a sniff , Nettie curled up on the squabs , heedless of arranging her skirts to cover her plump , milk-white legs .
