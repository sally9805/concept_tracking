Chapter One : The Three-Fifths Man Tuesday , October 9 His face wet with sweat and with tears , the man runs for freedom , he runs for his life . " There ! There he goes ! " The former slave does not know exactly where the voice comes from . Behind him ? To the right or left ? From atop one of the decrepit tenements lining the filthy cobblestoned streets here ? Amid July air hot and thick as liquid paraffin , the lean man leaps over a pile of horse dung . The street sweepers do n't come here , to this part of the city . Charles Singleton pauses beside a pallet stacked high with barrels , trying to catch his breath . A crack of a pistol . The bullet goes wide . The sharp report of the gun takes him back instantly to the war : the impossible , mad hours as he stood his ground in a dusty blue uniform , steadying a heavy musket , facing men wearing dusty gray , aiming their own weapons his way . Running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also miss . " Somebody stop him ! Five dollars ' gold if you catch him . " But the few people out on the streets this early  --  mostly Irish ragpickers and laborers trooping to work with hods or picks on their shoulders  --  have no inclination to stop the Negro , who has fierce eyes and large muscles and such frightening determination . As for the reward , the shouted offer came from a city constable , which means there 's no coin behind the promise . At the Twenty-third Street paintworks , Charles veers west . He slips on the slick cobblestones and falls hard . A mounted policeman rounds the corner and , raising his nightstick , bears down on the fallen man . And then  - -  And ? the girl thought . And ? Whathappened to him ? Sixteen-year-old Geneva Settle twisted the knob on the microfiche reader again but it would move no farther ; she 'd come to the last page on this carriage . She lifted out the metal rectangle containing the lead article in the July 23 , 1868 , edition of Coloreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dusty box , she worried that the remaining pages of the article were missing and she 'd never find out what happened to her ancestor Charles Singleton . She 'd learned that historical archives regarding black history were often incomplete , if not forever misplaced . Where was the rest of the story ? Ah ... Finally she found it and mounted the carriage carefully into the battered gray reader , moving the knob impatiently to locate the continuation of the story of Charles 's flight . Geneva 's lush imagination  --  and years of immersing herself in books  --  had given her the wherewithal to embellish the bare-bones magazine account of the former slave 's pursuit through the hot , foul streets of nineteenth-century New York . She almost felt she was back there , rather than where she really was at the moment : nearly 140 years later in the deserted fifth-floor library of the Museum of African-American Culture and History on Fifty-fifth Street in Midtown Manhattan . As she twisted the dial , the pages streamed past on the grainy screen . Geneva found the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF A FREEDMAN 'S CRIME CHARLES SINGLETON , A VETERAN OF THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES , BETRAYS THE CAUSE OF OUR PEOPLE IN A NOTORIOUS INCIDENT A picture accompanying the article showed twenty-eight-year-old Charles Singleton in his Civil War uniform . He was tall , his hands were large and the tight fit of the uniform on his chest and arms suggested powerful muscles . Lips broad , cheekbones high , head round , skin quite dark . Staring at the unsmiling face , the calm , piercing eyes , the girl believed there was a resemblance between them  --  she had the head and face of her ancestor , the roundness of his features , the rich shade of his skin . Not a bit of the Singleton physique , though . Geneva Settle was skinny as a grade-school boy , as the Delano Project girls loved to point out . She began to read once more , but a noise intruded . A click in the room . A door latch ? Then she heard footsteps . They paused . Another step . Finally silence . She glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but told herself not to be freaked . It was just bad memories that put her on edge : the Delano girls whaling on her in the school yard behind Langston Hughes High , and that time Tonya Brown and her crew from the St. Nicholas Houses dragged her into an alley then pounded her so bad that she lost a back tooth . Boys groped , boys dissed , boys put you down . But it was the girls who made you bleed . Get her down , cut her , cut the bitch ... More footsteps . Another pause . Silence . The nature of this place did n't help . Dim , musty , quiet . And there was no one else here , not at eight-fifteen on a Tuesday morning . The museum was n't open yet  --  tourists were still asleep or having their breakfasts  --  but the library opened at eight . Geneva had been waiting here when they unlocked the doors , she 'd been so eager to read the article . She now sat in a cubicle at the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the walls were filled with paintings of men in bizarre hats , women in bonnets and horses with wack , skinny legs . Another footstep . Then another pause . Should she leave ? Go hang with Dr. Barry , the librarian , until this creepy dude left ? And then the other visitor laughed . Not a weird laugh , a fun laugh . And he said , " Okay . I 'll call you later . " A snap of a cell phone folding up . That 's why he 'd been pausing , just listening to the person on the other end of the line . Told you not to worry , girl . People are n't dangerous when they laugh . They are n't dangerous when they say friendly things on cell phones . He 'd been walking slowly because that 's what people do when they 're talking  --  even though what kind of rude claimer 'd make a phone call in a library ? Geneva turned back to the microfiche screen , wondering , You get away , Charles ? Man , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than own up to his mischief , as a courageous man would do , continued his cowardly flight . So much for objective reporting , she thought angrily . For a time he evaded his pursuers . But escape was merely temporary . A Negro tradesman on a porch saw the freedman and implored him to stop , in the name of justice , asserting that he had heard of Mr. Singleton 's crime and reproaching him for bringing dishonor upon all colored people throughout the nation . The citizen , one Walker Loakes , thereupon flung a brick at Mr. Singleton with the intent of knocking him down . However , Charles dodges the heavy stone and turns to the man , shouting , " I am innocent . I did not do what the police say ! " Geneva 's imagination had taken over and , inspired by the text , was writing the story once again . But Loakes ignores the freedman 's protests and runs into the street , calling to the police that the fugitive is headed for the docks . His heart torn , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joshua , the former slave continues his desperate run for freedom . Sprinting , sprinting ... Behind him comes the gallop of mounted police . Ahead of him , other horsemen appear , led by a helmeted police officer brandishing a pistol . " Halt , halt where you are , Charles Singleton ! I am Detective Captain William Simms . I 've been searching for you for two days . " The freedman does as ordered . His broad shoulders slump , strong arms at his sides , chest heaving as he sucks in the humid , rancid air beside the Hudson River . Nearby is the tow boat office , and up and down the river he sees the spindles of sailing ship masts , hundreds of them , taunting him with their promise of freedom . He leans , gasping , against the large Swiftsure Express Company sign . Charles stares at the approaching officer as the clop , clop , clop of his horse 's hooves resonate loudly on the cobblestones . " Charles Singleton , you are under arrest for burglary . You will surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will end up in shackles . Pick the first and you will suffer no pain . Pick the second , you will end up bloody . The choice is yours . " " I have been accused of a crime I did not commit ! " " I repeat : Surrender or die . Those are your only choices . " " No , sir , I have one other , " Charles shouts . He resumes his flight  --  toward the dock . " Stop or we will shoot ! " Detective Simms calls . But the freedman bounds over the railing of the pier like a horse taking a picket in a charge . He seems to hang in the air for a moment then cartwheels thirty feet into the murky waters of the Hudson River , muttering some words , perhaps a plea to Jesus , perhaps a declaration of love for his wife and child , though whatever they might be none of his pursuers can hear . Fifty feet from the microfiche reader forty-one-year-old Thompson Boyd moved closer to the girl . He pulled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the cylinder of his pistol to make sure it was n't jammed . He 'd checked it earlier but , in this job , you could never be too certain . He put the gun into his pocket and pulled the billy club out of a slit cut into his dark raincoat . He was in the stacks of books in the costume exhibit hall , which separated him from the microfiche-reader tables . His latex-gloved fingers pressed his eyes , which had been stinging particularly sharply this morning . He blinked from the pain . He looked around again , making sure the room was in fact deserted . No guards were here , none downstairs either . No security cameras or sign-in sheets . All good . But there were some logistical problems . The big room was deathly quiet , and Thompson could n't hide his approach to the girl . She 'd know someone was in the room with her and might become edgy and alert . So after he 'd stepped inside this wing of the library and locked the door behind him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing years ago . But he was also a craftsman who understood the power of humor  --  and how to use it to your advantage in this line of work . A laugh  --  coupled with a farewell pleasantry and a closing cell phone  --  would put her at ease , he reckoned . This ploy seemed to work . He looked quickly around the long row of shelves and saw the girl , staring at the microfiche screen . Her hands , at her sides , seemed to clench and unclench nervously at what she was reading . He started forward . Then stopped . The girl was pushing away from the table . He heard her chair slide on the linoleum . She was walking somewhere . Leaving ? No . He heard the sound of the drinking fountain and her gulping some water . Then he heard her pulling books off the shelf and stacking them up on the microfiche table . Another pause and she returned to the stacks once again , gathering more books . The thud as she set them down . Finally he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then silence . Thompson looked again . She was back in her chair , reading one of the dozen books piled in front of her . With the bag containing the condoms , razor knife and duct tape in his left hand , the club in his right , he started toward her again . Coming up behind her now , twenty feet , fifteen , holding his breath . Ten feet . Even if she bolted now , he could lunge forward and get her  --  break a knee or stun her with a blow to the head . Eight feet , five ... He paused and silently set the rape pack on a shelf . He took the club in both hands . He stepped closer , lifting the varnished oak rod . Still absorbed in the words , she read intently , oblivious to the fact that her attacker was an arm 's length behind her . Thompson swung the club downward with all his strength toward the top of the girl 's stocking cap . Crack ... A painful vibration stung his hands as the baton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wrong . The sound , the feel were off . What was going on ? Thompson Boyd leapt back as the body fell to the floor . And tumbled into pieces . The torso of the mannequin fell one way . The head another . Thompson stared for a moment . He glanced to his side and saw a ball gown draped over the bottom half of the same mannequin  --  part of a display on women 's clothing in Reconstruction America . No ... Somehow , she 'd tipped to the fact that he was a threat . She 'd then collected some books from the shelves as a cover for standing up and taking apart a mannequin . She 'd dressed the upper part of it in her own sweatshirt and stocking cap then propped it on the chair . But where was she ? The slap of racing feet answered the question . Thompson Boyd heard her sprinting for the fire door . The man slipped the billy club into his coat , pulled out his gun and started after her .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
