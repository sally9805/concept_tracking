Summer of ' 38 // I always thought I had a fairly normal childhood , until I found out my parents were n't who I thought they were . I grew up in Coatesville , Pennsylvania , a small town in the hills along the Brandywine River on the threshold of the rich farmland of the Amish country . We were only forty miles from Philadelphia , and the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad ran through our town . And yet Philadelphia might as well have been the moon . That was the Big City . Coatesville was nowhere , but for a little girl it was everywhere  --  it was all I had and all I knew . Coatesville was what was considered a one-horse town , but that horse was a very powerful steed called steel . The Lukens Steel Company dominated everything about our town . Its dozens of soaring smokestacks dominated the skyline . They were our own skyscrapers . Even the smoke belching from those enormous stacks was a point of pride , not pollution . That pungent , thick , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little town was booming . It was the smell of money . // Like most men in Coatesville , my father , John Henry Washington , worked for the steel mills . Bethlehem Steel and Worth Brothers Steel had huge plants in Coatesville , but the colossus was Lukens Steel . Like an industrial octopus , Lukens had devoured its rivals and made them its own . The matriarch of the business was a legendary local character named Rebecca Lukens , known as " The Woman of Steel . " She was an independent woman , far ahead of her time , a Pennsylvania version of a steel magnolia . Rebecca was the driving force behind the expansion of her family ' s Brandywine Iron Works into an international powerhouse . She was one of the first women in America to run a major company , and her daughter married a man named Huston . When I was growing up , the Hustons were Coatesville 's first family . They lived in a grand manor house called Terracina and were to Coatesville what the Kennedys or the Rockefellers are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15,000 people ) , I never met a Huston , and , by the same token , I never aspired to become a woman of steel . American women today have those sort of huge " have it all " ambitions , but growing up black during the Great Depression , I was perfectly happy to dream about becoming a nurse . That was a pretty big deal at the time , and I was more ambitious than most . // My mother , or at least the woman who I thought was my mother , kept house , while daddy worked on the assembly line . Mother had worked as a picker in the cotton fields of South Carolina and said that was enough hard labor for two lifetimes . I had a half-brother , Calvin Burton , who was my mother 's son by a previous relationship , which I later learned was not an actual marriage . Calvin was seven years older than I , and by the time I was thirteen , in 1938 , he had left home to live in New York City . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse in a big city hospital , but these were only fantasies . At thirteen , I still had n't gotten to Philadelphia . // We lived in a small , two-story , three-bedroom row house in a neighborhood called The Spruces , named after the tree , which was populated by other black steelworkers . Most of them , like my family , hailed from the South . I had my own room , which seemed like a castle to me . The house was heated with coal stoves , and ther e was no r unning water or any bathr ooms . We had to use an outhouse in the back and take tub baths in the bedroom using water we 'd carry from an outside pump . It sounds primitive , but it seemed normal then , although the winters were awfully cold , and the day of the week the big sanitation trucks would come to clean the outhouses was the smelliest day you could imagine . We 'd all try to stay away from home on that day . I remember visiting the home of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , but it did have an indoor toilet . It seemed like the ultimate in high technology at the time . // I 'll never forget the wonderful dinners we 'd have : fried chicken , biscuits , lots of fresh vegetables , and the sweetest pies made with local peaches , strawberries , apples , and plums . Every night was like Thanksgiving . My mother , who was tall and slim and a great cook , always wore a kerchief around her head . That seemed old-fashioned at the time , as did her habit of chewing tobacco and expelling it into a spittoon . I gathered that it was an old southern custom she 'd brought with her . I did n't question her about it . In fact , I did n't tend to question things at all . My parents were of the " children should be seen and not heard " school . As a little girl I started out quite chatty , but one day my mother warned me " that mouth of yours can get you into trouble , " after which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked much at those fine dinners , partly because we were all listening to the radio all through the meal . That was our ear to the world . Despite all the bad news that seemed to be coming through the airwaves  --  the seemingly endless Depression , the rise of the Nazis in Europe , disasters like the Hindenburg airship explosion  --  the feeling around the table was very positive . My father , a handsome man who always came to the table after a hard , dusty day at the mills immaculate and smelling deliciously of soap and cologne , always said a blessing of thanks , for the food , for his job , for his wonderful family , and for funny or odd things , like Shirley Temple , or Charlie Chan , or Heinz ketchup ... //
