Section : 50/50 : THE 50 BIGGEST CHANGES IN THE LAST 50 YEARS <p> With American Heritage approaching its fiftieth birthday in December 2004 , we 've asked five prominent historians and cultural commentators to each pick 10 leading developments in American life during the last half-century . In this issue John Steele Gordon , American Heritage 's " The Business of America " columnist and the author of An Empire of Wealth : The Epic History of American Economic Power , 1607-2001 , which will be published in October by HarperCollins , selects the 10 biggest changes in business . In other issues this year our authorities offer their choices of the half-century 's biggest transformations in politics ; popular culture ; innovation and technology ; and the home and the family . <p> In 1954 the gross domestic product of the United States - the sum of all the goods and services produced in the country that year - was about $380 billion . In 2003 it was $10.9 trillion , more than 28 times as great in nominal terms . Even allowing for the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is roughly 6 times as large as it was when American Heritage made its first appearance . So the biggest change in American business in the last 50 years has been , simply , the growth of the American economy as a whole . <p> But how all that wealth is created - who creates it , and by what means - has changed almost beyond imagining . The reason is plain enough : the computer . It is the most profound technological development since the steam engine ignited the Industrial Revolution two centuries ago , perhaps since the agricultural revolution ignited civilization itself 10 millennia ago . None of the biggest changes in business in the last 50 years would have been possible - or would have evolved as they did - had it not been for the computer . So while it easily ranks as the most important change , the computer , in truth , is behind nearly all the changes . <p> 1 The Computer Look at a photograph of a typical office of the mid-fifties and one of 2004 , and the difference is instantly obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . Today half of American workers use computers on a daily basis in their jobs ; in 1954 perhaps one-tenth of one percent did . Moreover , not just office workers use computers . Farmers , garage mechanics , dentists , lumberjacks , and a thousand other job categories as well now utilize computers in the daily course of business for purposes unique to each occupation . <p> To be sure , in 1954 computers were already making inroads into American business , especially in areas where data processing was very intense , such as banking and insurance . But they were huge and hugely expensive , kept in special air-conditioned rooms and tended by men in white coats . Very few Americans had ever actually seen one . Today about the only way for an American not to see one every day would be to stay in bed with the lights off . <p> The difference is the development , beginning in 1969 , of the microprocessor , essentially a dirt-cheap computer on a silicon chip . A little more than a decade later , the calculator had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the typewriter a relic , and Apple Computer had introduced the personal computer . <p> 2 Globalization In 1954 mm American exports totaled less than $14 billion , or 3.7 percent of GDP . In 2001 exports amounted to $729 billion , or 7.2 percent of GDP . Fifty years ago the American economy was effectively an island . The only great power whose industrial base had been strengthened , not diminished , by World War II , the United States was still self-sufficient in all but a few commodities ( such as tin ) . Almost all the cars on the road in 1954 were , in their entirety , American-made by the Big Three auto companies , plus American Motors . What foreign automobiles there were , were mostly in niche markets , such as sports cars . <p> Today that is but a distant memory . American Motors is long gone , and the Big Three have only a little over half the American automobile market , about what GM had all by itself 50 years ago . The number one best-selling car in this country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toyota Camry . But many of the " foreign " cars on the roads today are in fact manufactured in the United States , and many of them are subsequently exported to other countries . <p> Automobile companies no longer have nationalities , except perhaps in terms of the locations of their corporate headquarters and greatest concentration of stockholders . Ford now owns Sweden 's Volvo and Britain 's Land Rover ; GM owns Saab ; Chrysler is part of the German Daimler . Every major automobile company manufactures parts or assembles vehicles in many countries . General Motors , with 15 percent of the global vehicle market , manufactures in 32 countries and sells in 192 . The other great auto companies are equally dispersed . <p> That is increasingly true of companies in other lines of business , such as electronics and computers . It is also becoming true of retail companies . Wal-Mart , the world 's largest company in terms of gross revenues ( if it were a sovereign nation , it would have the world 's thirtieth-largest economy ) , sells in 10 countries and buys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wares from Bangor to Bangalore , from Peoria to Paraguay , while American shopping malls are full of foreign products and foreign companies selling them . <p> 3 Communications In 1950 about a million overseas phone calls originated in the United States . In 2001 the number was a staggering 6.27 billion . In 1954 only radio-telephony , with a very limited capacity , was available . Today a cat 's cradle of undersea cables together with communications satellites provides nearly limitless capacity . In 1954 you needed a reservation to make an overseas phone call , and it would likely have cost a significant percentage of your weekly wage . Now it often costs less to call London than it did to make a local call 30 years ago . When you dial an 800 number , you may well find yourself talking - absolutely free - to someone in India . <p> Even domestically the increase in communications has been profound . You can not walk down a city street , or even a supermarket aisle , without seeing people talking away on cell phones . Airports are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their companies ' computer networks , while they wait for their flights . The increase in executive efficiency as a result has been enormous ( and the ability to " get away from the office " much diminished ) . <p> 4 The Financial Revolution Many Americans in 1954 still handled their financial affairs largely in cash . They received their pay in cash , and they paid their bills in cash . The reforms of the New Deal had ended the fear of banks ' collapsing , so many families maintained savings accounts to safeguard their rainy-day funds , but far fewer had checking accounts or ready access to bank credit . <p> In 1951 a Long Island banker named William Boyle invented the credit card . It was a classic capitalist win-win-win situation : Credit cards allowed merchants to avoid the expense and risk of maintaining charge accounts ; they gave banks handsome profits on unpaid balances ; and they spread credit , formerly reserved largely to the affluent , to a whole new class of consumers . By the 1960s credit cards were common . Today they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States in 2002 by 190 million cardholders . Thanks to credit cards - and their latter-day descendants debit cards - cash is rapidly disappearing from American retailing . <p> Other parts of our economy 's financial sector have also grown beyond all expectations in the last 50 years . In 1954 the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally topped its 1929 high of 381.17 . Today the Dow Jones stands more than 26 times higher than it did then . In 1954 there were 115 mutual funds in operation in this country , with investments worth $6.1 billion . In 2002 the number was more than 10,000 mutual funds controlling $7 trillion in capital . The percentage of people owning stocks and mutual funds has grown explosively as well , with over half the population directly holding financial securities . Many more have interests in pension funds . <p> Capitalism has become truly democratic in the last 50 years , and it is getting more so every day . <p> 5 Management and Labor In 1954 more than a third of all American workers belonged to unions , mostly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . But that does n't tell the whole story , for nearly half of today 's union members are government employees , such as teachers and hospital workers , virtually none of whom were unionized in 1954 . <p> Meanwhile , the number of strikes has greatly diminished . In 1960 there were 222 work stoppages involving more than 1,000 workers , with 13,260,000 workdays lost . In 2002 there were only 9 such strikes , with 660,000 lost workdays , although the size of the American work force has doubled in the last 50 years . <p> 6 Productivity Part of the reason for the decline of the labor movement is the shift from manufacturing to services as the major source of jobs in the American economy . The United States has not stopped making things ( total manufacturing output grew by more than a third between 1990 and 2001 ) but is becoming ever more efficient at it , thanks to the rapidly increasing use of computers in the process . <p> The recent history of manufacturing in this country is very similar to the longer history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage of the population living on farms has steadily declined , as has the percentage of GDP that is derived from agriculture . That trend did not stop in the last 50 years ; it accelerated . <p> In 1954 , 11.6 percent of the population lived on farms . Today less than 2 percent does . The amount of land devoted to agriculture has also declined , from 1.16 billion acres in 1954 to 941 million in 2001 . In 1954 , 82 million acres were planted in corn ; in 2002 the number was down to 79 million . Yet corn production went from close to 3 billion bushels to 9 billion . Wheat acreage has held steady at about 60 million , but production has gone from 984 million bushels in 1954 to 1.6 billion in 2002 . <p> 7 Women In 1954 the typical American woman was a housewife . That is certainly no longer the case , with more than 60 percent of American women in the work force . Moreover , women in business are no longer confined to the steno pool by any means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . ) In 1967 Muriel Siebert became the first woman to own a seat on that ultimate male bastion the New York Stock Exchange . All major corporations now have female executives , half the Forbes 500 companies have female corporate officers , and eight have female CEOs . There is no question that these numbers will rise as talented women who started working in the last few years reach their career peaks . <p> While the feminist movement has had a powerful influence on the attitude toward women in business in the last 50 years , there has been another major factor in increasing the number of women in business rather than the home : domestic productivity . Greatly improved and much more widely distributed household appliances - washing machines , dryers , stoves , dishwashers , microwave ovens , icemakers , vacuum cleaners - make housework far less time-consuming than it was 50 years ago , while the proliferation of prepared and semiprepared foods has made it much easier to get a meal on the table . In 1954 only the new TV dinner was available as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of options , and some of them actually taste good . <p> 8 The imperial , and Imperially Compensated , CEO A few months before American Heritage first appeared , the last comedy by George S. Kaufman ( in collaboration with Howard Teichman ) opened on Broadway , and two years later it was made into a highly successful film . It was titled The Solid Gold Cadillac , and it told of chicanery in high corporate places . But while recent scandals have shown that management wrongdoing is still alive and well in American business , if no worse than it was in the past , management compensation has gone through the roof . <p> Charles E. Wilson , the chief executive of General Motors before becoming Secretary of Defense in 1953 , was paid $652,000 a year , plus some stock options ( he took a $580,000 pay cut when he left GM to head the Pentagon ) . That was a tidy sum in the economic universe of the early 1950s , even though 91 percent of it was taxed away by the federal government . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12 million in total compensation . He gave over a maximum of 35 percent in taxes , but because much of that compensation came in the form of stock options , he actually paid far less tax than that . Many CEOs did a lot better . <p> 9 Antitrust Antitrust was one of the big political issues in the 50 years before American Heritage was born , but it has nearly disappeared in the half-century since . One reason , to be sure , is that mere bigness is no longer perceived as inherently bad , especially as more and more Americans have become stockholders and thus more inclined to see things from the capitalist point of view . <p> More important , however , has been the accelerating change in the economy caused by the microprocessor , and the glacial pace at which antitrust suits necessarily run . When the outgoing Johnson administration sued IBM under the antitrust statutes in 1969 , the company 's dominance over the American computer industry resembled Standard Oil 's over the petroleum industry 70 years earlier . <p> But by the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hegemony was a distant memory , and it was facing the most difficult decade of its corporate existence . Rapid technological change has proved a far more efficient policeman of the marketplace than any army of antitrust lawyers . <p> 10 The Internet The Internet is a communications medium and very much part of the communications revolution . But it is so new - barely a decade old as a popular medium - and so fundamentally important , that it deserves an entry all its own . As the railroad was to the steam engine , so the Internet is to the microprocessor , the most important spinoff of the basic technology . What is perhaps most impressive about it is that it erupted into existence almost spontaneously . Railroads had to be built with iron and wood and sweat . They were very expensive . The Internet costs so little to operate that almost anyone can have a Web site . That is why there are now about four billion Web sites in existence , and tens of thousands more are added every day . <p> The Internet allows people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers and sellers . Thus it performs much the same function as a broker . That , in turn , means that all traditional brokerage businesses - real estate agencies , stockbrokerages , auction houses , travel agencies - must change fundamentally or go out of business . <p> The news business as well is changing rapidly because of the Internet . Bloggers and Internet journalists like Matt Drudge ( who uncorked the Monica Lewinsky scandal ) can respond to breaking news much faster than can newspapers and TVnews organizations ( although now all major news organizations are on the Web as well ) . And because a Web site is so cheap to set up and operate , every news organization now finds its mistakes and biases mercilessly revealed by what the New York Times columnist William Safire has dubbed the " gotcha ! gang . " Retailing as well is moving to the Web , growing at about 30 percent a year . This is very bad news for the printers who produce catalogues and the post office that delivers them . <p> As we look back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only change - our restless country has always offered that - but something truly singular , change on a vaster scale than has happened during any 50-year period since the lookout on the Santa Maria first sighted land . <p> TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE HAS PROVED A FAR MORE EFFICIENT MARKETPLACE COP THAN ANY LAWYERS . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By John Steele Gordon <p>
