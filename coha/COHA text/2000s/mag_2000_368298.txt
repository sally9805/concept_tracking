This began when I pulled out a new pack of checks ( Nos. 5221 to 5260 ) and found a check-size notice informing me that I was going to be given the opportunity to test out some designs I might want the next time I reordered . The first five checks in this pack , it said , were of various styles but were also real checks , imprinted with my name and numbered in sequence with the rest of my checks . The first one had two kittens on it . <P> Like many of the other opportunities presented to me by my bank these days , this was not one I had longed for . To put it as politely as possible , I have no interest in kittens as a design element  --  or , for that matter , as kittens . From the 10 check styles pictured in miniature on yet another page  --  styles with names like Radiant Beginnings and Victorian Rose  --  it was easy to decide that I did n't want any of them . If a variety of check styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would prefer to be displayed as the sort of person who does n't use checks with designs on them . <P> " I ca n't send anybody these checks , " I said to my wife . " Kittens ! Angels ! " Yes , my check No. 5222 had an angel on it . I know I 'm on record as saying that the only exception I make to an absolutist belief in the free-speech guarantees of the First Amendment is that people who show slides of their trip to Europe should be put in jail for a very long time . But I 've been sorely tempted lately to make another exception for people who correspond on notepaper that has angels on it . <P> " So just do n't use those checks , " my wife said . " Tear them up . Go on to 5226 . " <P> As it happens , I 've always taken great pride in keeping my checkbook reconciled with my bank statement . I must have once heard my father refer to someone who was so financially inept that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've endeavored not to fall beneath even that modest standard . But this requires working on the outer edges of my financial and mathematical competence , and it would take less than the destruction of a few checks to throw everything out of kilter . <P> Should I change banks ? Should I start using money orders ? Then I was inspired by a phrase  --  " faceless bureaucracy . " I realized that I could get rid of 5221 through 5225 by using them to pay bills to institutions so large that even the presence of thoroughly revolting angels would go unnoticed . Check No. 5221 went to Con Edison for my electric bill . The angels wafted toward one of my many telephone companies . <P> No sooner had the checks been mailed than I began to have second thoughts . I could see a bartender whose wife worked at Con Edison glance at the name on my credit card and say , before the entire Friday-night crowd at the bar , " I wonder why you did n't bring your pussycats with you tonight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , I did send checks that were decorated with kittens and angels  --  maybe even a Victorian rose . But I had n't ordered those checks . Those checks are not the real me . I am the sort of person who does not use checks with designs on them . Really .
