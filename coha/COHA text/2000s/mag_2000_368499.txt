If the hugely popular Blackthorne Inn on Point Reyes Peninsula in Inverness , Calif. , were featured in , say , Architectural Digest , its style might be characterized as Tree-House Chic . Built four stories up a hillside teeming with 180-ft . Douglas firs , the Blackthorne is a combination of rustic and posh ( read : a hot tub set amid the clouds ) that has led fans to dub it a " treetop fantasy . " <P> It was n't planned to look this way . When Susan and Bill Wigert bought the acre of property in 1975 , they were looking for a modest vacation cabin . But as builders added rooms and bits of local history  --  beams from a San Francisco pier , hearthstones from Donner Pass  --  the place grew with an eccentric life of its own . Since 1982 , when the Wigerts converted it to a bed-and-breakfast , the inn has developed something of a cult following . <P> Cool details abound . There 's the spiral staircase , the skybridge , a stone hearth for fireside evenings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn 's literal topper is the Eagle 's Nest , a glass-enclosed octagon that offers a 360degree view of ocean , trees and sky . <P> Nearby Point Reyes National Seashore  --  a vast patch of ocean cliffs and beaches , bird sanctuaries , farms and forests  --  is great for exploring , and there 's kayaking in Tomales Bay . In early winter the famous Point Reyes Lighthouse , 308 steps down a cliff , provides a dramatic whale-watching vista . <P> The Wigerts are at the Blackthorne only sporadically , but the four part-time innkeepers receive kudos from guests . Says Coloradan Kent Widmar : " It 's like your own house "
