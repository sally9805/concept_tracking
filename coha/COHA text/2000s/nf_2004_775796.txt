The great dramatic battle of the twenty-first century is the dismantling of empire and the deepening of democracy . This is more a colossal fight over visions and ideas than a catastrophic struggle over profits and missiles . We live at a moment in which it has become fashionable to celebrate the benefits of imperial rule and to accentuate the deficiencies of democratic governance . The prevailing climate of opinion and culture of consumption makes it difficult to even conceive of new democratic possibilities and practices . // This slow yet frightening imperial devouring of American democracy flows from a lethal combination of free market fundamentalism , aggressive militarism , and escalating authoritarianism . Free market fundamentalism-just as significant as religious fundamentalisms-not only posits the unregulated market as idol and fetish ; it also devalues and demeans nonmarket activities like critical thought , compassionate temperament , and laughter at self and society . No democracy can survive without these precious commitments . No vital sense of public interest and common good can be sustained without these humanistic convictions . // Plutocratic economic arrangements-in which elite greed runs amok-create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . This top-heavy inequality puts a premium on instant success and short-term gain by any means and at any cost . It also erodes the fragile democratic trust between classes and groups . Needless to say , it sends an explosive message to the most vulnerable that they neither count nor matter . Democracies reap social chaos when such plutocratic seeds are sowed. // Aggressive militarism-whether abroad , as in armed invasion in Iraq , or at home , as in police violations-heralds force as the desirable means of resolving problems . It demotes diplomacy and degrades dialogue-two crucial pillars of any democratic regime . And , as with Sophocles ' Creon in Antigone , the preoccupation with might easily leads to myopic arrogance and hideous hubris of nations and persons . As the mechanisms of deliberation and modes of cooperation weaken , unchecked power reigns supreme . No democracy can thrive without legitimate forms of accountability containing such power . // Escalating authoritarianism feeds public paranoia and cuts off the democratic lifeblood of any society . The curtailment of liberties and the repression of rights make the hard-won rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowing of political discourse disempowers citizens and discourages novel approaches to pressing problems . The ideological monitoring of schools and universities dampens the imagination and ingenuity of talented and creative young people . Freedom of expression is the indispensable precondition for any democratic experiment . // The perennial battle between empire and democracy-that reaches from Athens to America-sits at the center of human efforts to preserve decency and dignity , excellence and elegance , freedom and equality . We not only ignore it at our own peril ; we also must acknowledge that the very moral grounds of our prosperity are at stake . // ( Continues ... ) //
