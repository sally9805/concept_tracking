Tiger Magic The Tiger 's Apprentice , Book Three By Laurence Yep HarperCollins Publishers , Inc . Laurence Yep The Pi-pi She looks most like a fox with wings and honks like a wild goose . When people see her , they know a terrible drought is coming .  - -  Shan Hai Ching The Phoenix The King of all birds has feathers as red as cinnabar and appears only in times of peace and justice . It is said to have the power to make evil creatures good .  - -  Tradition The Chinatown antique store seemed as deserted as the alley . The closed sign hung on the front door beneath yellow strips with strange pictures and words in red ink . But that was deceptive , for deep within the basement , the tiger wizard , Mr. Hu , was debating strategy with the Lady Torka , who was in charge of the defenders . She had taken her true form , of a fox with a beautiful pair of snowy white wings . The feathers were tipped with edged steel so that they looked like rows of daggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headless snake , the emblem of the rebels . " Everything is ready , " the tiger said , his voice echoing in the huge chamber that had been created just last month beneath his store . He sat upon one of the many cushioned benches . " The dragon mages have created the portal charms and we are placing them around Chinatown . The dragons will come when we sendword . " Lady Torka accepted a cup of tea from Tom , the boy who was Mr. Hu 's apprentice . She seemed too dainty to have led a group of rebels against their terrible master , Vatten , and to now face dreadful punishments if captured . She tapped her folded white fan against her chin . " The dragons take a risk in coming here when their own kingdom is under attack , " Lady Torka warned . " His Highness knows the risk , but the stakes are worth it , " Mr. Hu said as he took the other cup from his apprentice . " If only we can make this happen . " Lady Torka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup . " So far , Vatten has had the initiative . He strikes where and when he wants but never with his whole strength . It is like fighting a will-o ' - the- wisp . We need to lure all of Vatten 's forces into the open so we can crush them . " " We have to draw him into a trap somehow , " Mr. Hu agreed . For ages in China , Vatten had been seeking the fabled phoenix , who had the power to change people 's wills , either for good or evil . A past Guardian had fled to America with the phoenix egg , where it had passed into the hands of succeeding Guardians , including Tom 's grandmother and now Mr. Hu . Mr. Hu had managed to create an alliance of Lady Torka 's rebels , who had once served Vatten , the dragons , and a force of heroes and spirits from China . It was the crowning achievement , so far , of Mr. Hu 's brief Guardianship to bring together these former foes , united by their hatred of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad monster 's control . When Vatten 's spies had stolen the phoenix egg , Tom and Mr. Hu had both nearly died recovering it . They had retreated to the dragon kingdom , where the dragons , desperate to fight off Vatten 's followers , had stolen the egg for themselves and forced the phoenix to hatch prematurely . With the birth of the phoenix , old powers stirred from their slumbers to wreak havoc again ; and for the last month , the world had gone to war -- though few humans knew it . Around the world , in the wilds of the land and sea , fantastical armies drew themselves up into ranks and fought fiercely , with no mercy being asked or given , as Vatten 's followers sought to reach the phoenix and the allies tried to prevent them . However , the deadliest and greatest battle was currently being waged in San Francisco 's Chinatown . Friend and foe operated in small units , hunting and being hunted . Struggles broke out in alleys , on rooftops , and within the sewers , and were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived , with all the casualties removed . As yet , neither side wanted human interference in their shadow war . The television and newspapers blamed any destruction on gang warfare ; and even though the human gangs insisted they were not at fault , no one believed them . Tom nearly dropped the tray when he heard the screech . Shrill and angry , the sound ripped through a roof and two floors and into the subterranean chamber . Tom could n't help trembling , which made the tea pot rattle . Tom wondered what dreadful monster was trying to break into the store now . He 'd already fought some creatures straight out of his nightmares -- and a few so awful he could never have imagined them . Even the battle-hardened Lady Torka glanced upward anxiously . " Are you sure the phoenix is safe here ? " " The store was a former bank , so it 's strong structurally , and it 's on the nexus of several lines of ch'i . My wards have made it into a fortress against most magic , " Mr. Hu said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nervous apprentice and set it down on the bench . " And I trust your warriors . " As if on cue , the screeching ended abruptly as the defenders dealt with the threat . With each passing day , the store felt more and more like a prison and everyone 's nerves became frayed by the daily assaults . Tom found himself prowling about the store almost as much as the tiger did . Lady Torka rose . " Still , I should see what 's happened . Thank you for the tea . It was quite delicious , " she said , as calmly as if she were leaving to tend her garden . Mr. Hu sprang from the couch and bowed . " As you see fit , Lady Torka . Only a fool would argue with your wisdom . " " Take good care of our phoenix , Thomas . " Lady Torka saluted him with her fan . Her eyes lingered on the golden scale on Tom 's cheek .
