The dotcom bust . Staggering budget deficits . A hellzapoppin ' gubernatorial recall . What other misfortune could happen to California ? Well , Joan Didion , who was born and raised there , could write an elegantly acerbic book arguing that the sustaining myths by which the state defines itself are false , self-deluding and corrupt . Where I Was From ( Knopf ; 226 pages ) is that book , and Governor-elect Schwarzenegger , for one , can give thanks that it was written too soon to include him . <P> The fundamental California myth is that noble 19th century pioneers braved the Sierras in order to cultivate a golden promised land . Not quite , says Didion . The great crossing was often " a mean scrambling for survival , a blind flight . " And what of the early Californians ' inspirational unity with nature ? " They took what they could , " writes Didion , " and ... set about selling the rest . " As for their vaunted individualism , the state 's residents have always been largely subsidized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad times " of the present , when " virtually every county is ... dependent on defense contracts . " <P> Didion makes these verdicts personal by presenting her own family  --  Californians for five generations  --  as prime embodiments of the state 's ambiguous destiny . Nor does she spare herself : she offers a probing critique of what she now considers her wrongheaded nostalgia for the old California in her 1963 novel , Run River . Where I Was From , in fact , is " an exploration into my own confusions about the place and the way in which I grew up . " <P> The exploration takes her off on many tangents , from the novels of Frank Norris to the sociology of the aerospace community of Lakewood . Some of these passages feel worked up and only loosely relevant . But as in all of Didion 's reportage  --  including an earlier take on California , Slouching Towards Bethlehemher appraisal is cool , her eye is sharp , and her turn of phrase is wicked . <P> The family portraits , though , are what weave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Didion gives a charming account of her maternal grandmother , an extravagant spirit who , like many women in her family , tended toward " slight and major derangements . " Her father , a hard-drinking depressive , leveraged one real estate deal after another with little money . " His idea of a relaxing way to make a payment was to drive to Nevada and shoot craps all night . " The remembered details of family life yield vivid metaphors for her theme , none better than this : in a Sacramento house the Didions moved into in 1951 , the gold silk organza curtains on the stairs had n't been changed since 1907 . They " hung almost two stories , billowed iridescent with every breath of air , and , if touched , crumbled . "  --  By Christopher Porterfield
