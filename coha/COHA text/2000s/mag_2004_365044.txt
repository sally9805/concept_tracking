I just finished reading President Clinton 's side of the story June 28 . He 's still his same old charming self and one of our greatest Presidents , in spite of his weaknesses . And who has none ? Under Clinton , the U.S. economy was great . The deficit was eliminated . No devastating wars . No killings . I 'd vote for him again if he could run  --  and I 'm an old-time Republican . ELLEN RUARK Southbury , Conn . <P> Good men do not have to explain themselves , just as good Presidents do not have to write books to shape their legacy or justify their deeds . A person 's actions speak for themselves . JERRY GARBER San Antonio , Texas <P> How I miss Clinton 's intelligent , thoughtful and truly compassionate leadership . He has the kind of genuine concern that pays more than lip service to the needs of the common citizen . I was struck by the fluidity of his responses and his understanding of complex geopolitical issues . I am so used to the current Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't respond to anything  --  that I had forgotten what real leadership sounds like . LYNN CAPEHART San Diego <P> I voted for Bill Clinton  --  twice . I think he was a great President who did terrific things for our country . I absolutely deplore and abominate , however , the person that Clinton is . And I know the meaning of is . Anything for which Clinton should have been respected has been overshadowed by his lascivious behavior and abuse of power . DAVID PARK BROWN Kailua , Hawaii <P> Bill Clinton tells of how counseling helped him overcome his demons . Perhaps the Clinton haters who still seethe with rage at our former President  --  and who spent much of the ' 90s spreading vicious rumors about him  --  should follow Clinton 's lead and seek counseling as well . Surely they have demons of their own to overcome . QUENTIN DUNNE Sherman Oaks , Calif . <P> Joe Klein thinks Clinton 's book will usher in " a brief return to the noxious ' 90s , a brouhaha for which not many people are nostalgic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away by his powers of alliteration . Everybody I know is nostalgic for the ' 90s , but maybe people like us , who come from the L.A. ghetto , do n't count . When Bill Clinton dies , the streets of Washington will be thronged with weeping , praying mourners . But they wo n't be like the people who watched Reagan 's funeral procession . Many of Clinton 's mourners will be people who actually live in Washington : black people . VICTORIA BRAGO Los Angeles <P> Although Bill Clinton may have been relevant as President , he is largely irrelevant now . And so is his book . ROBERT BILLS Laguna Beach , Calif . <P> What Joe Klein glosses over is that Clinton was probably the only U.S. President who held up a mirror to the nation so it could inspect its own morality and yet survive the shattered image . Clinton 's legacy will be much more than an attack on the moneyed right . His work in the field of AIDS through his foundation is more useful than George W. Bush 's limp efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than an eternal flame : the collective respect of those who know that through transgression , suffering and humility we reach our full human potential .
