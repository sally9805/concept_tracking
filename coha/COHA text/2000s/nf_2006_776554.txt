ONE // ONE WEEK IN 1943 // 1 . Hell 's Bottom // A year after the Al Qaeda attack , at a rededication ceremony on September // 11 , 2002 , much was made of the post-9/11 repairs having been completed in // a mere twelve months . No one seemed to know that the entire Building had // been constructed from start to finish in less than sixteen months . It was // made of cement for which 700,000 tons of sand were dredged from the // Potomac riverbed next to the site . The river 's edge is key to the Building 's // impression , evoking a forbidden temple of the timeless past , as if looming // over the ancient Nile.1 The picturesque lagoon that sets off the River // Entrance , like a plaza waiting to receive the barge of Cleopatra , is a vestige // of that dredging.2 // Relatively little steel was used in the construction  --  those ramps // instead of elevators  --  because it was needed just then for bullets , shells , // and tanks . Planners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , the hulking edifice would be handed over for civilian use : a depot for // government records or  --  and this is what my mother told me , which is why I // always believed it , even after learning it was a myth  --  a facility for the care // of wounded and disabled veterans , the ramps built for wheelchairs and // gurneys . The largest hospital in the world . My mother 's devotion to this idea // was sacralized when my brother Joe was stricken with polio , making her a // haunter of hospitals , a connoisseur of ramps . Joe 's polio , in turn , transformed // into worship her devotion to the similarly stricken , but nobly unbowed , // President Roosevelt . He was photographed visiting the Building just before its // completion in January 1943 , but there is no record of his using a wheelchair // there . // In fact , Roosevelt was deeply conflicted about the Pentagon . As // assistant secretary of the Navy during WorldWar I , he had ordered the // construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // eyesores were still there twenty years later , despoiling especially the Mall // between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument . The // structures were a source of self-rebuke to Roosevelt . The War Department // alone occupied seventeen separate facilities around Washington . To // consolidate the offices in one handsome place , FDR had personally overseen // the construction of a new headquarters building at 21st Street in Foggy // Bottom , but no sooner was it completed than World War II broke out . By mid- // 1941 , the Army had mushroomed to a million and a half men ; the new // headquarters was instantly inadequate , and senior Army officials told the // president they would never use it.3 Though its entrance was decorated by a // huge , undiplomatic martial mural  --  helmeted soldiers in combat  --  the // building would become the headquarters of the State Department , which it // remains to this day . // The size of the space was not the only issue . The freshly // empowered Army wanted its new building to be set apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from entanglements with , and the limits // of , the seat of government . In a time of peril , the Army was not about to be // treated as just another bureaucratic function , alongside Interior and // Commerce and Indian Affairs . The Army would transcend . Senior military // officials immediately began scouting sites outside the city  --  this despite the // explicit terms of congressional appropriations for construction within // Washington.4 A site in Virginia appealed to the Army because , for one // thing , District of Columbia architectural supervision would not hinder the // mammoth scale envisioned by departmental planners . Yet even across the // river the initial site selection proved controversial . The D.C. Fine Arts // Commission , chaired by Roosevelt 's cousin Frederick A. Delano , reached // across the Potomac to denounce the " flagrant disregard " 5 of context in the // Army 's wish to build at the western end of Memorial Bridge . The site was // then occupied by Arlington Farms , an agricultural research facility  --  all that // was left of Robert E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long // before been seized by the federal government to serve as the national // cemetery . Recovering from the punitive impulse of that requisition , // Washington had , in the 1920s , established a symbol of reconciliation // between North and South by aligning an axis along Memorial Bridge between // Lee 's becolumned mansion atop the hill at Arlington and the Lincoln // Memorial , which was completed in 1922 . Joined to Lincoln in this way , Lee // was thus linked along the Mall to George Washington and the Capitol . The // proposed new War Department building , just below the Lee mansion and // directly on that axis , would destroy the geographic symbol of national // reconciliation . // When that was pointed out to President Roosevelt , he ordered the // War Department building moved about a mile downriver . At the same time , // considering the architects ' plans for the hulking structure , FDR ordered the // size of the building reduced by half . Among other considerations , the // president expressed concern for the psychological effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also affirmed that , // after " the present emergency , " the War Department headquarters would be // returned to Washington where it belonged ; no permanent headquarters // building would be necessary in Virginia . Roosevelt found himself declaring // that the Army could make do , as the Navy would , with yet more tempos. // ( The Navy Annex was constructed to be temporary , but to this day it sits on // the Arlington ridge , above the Pentagon . ) When the general in charge of the // project objected to these terms , the president said , " My dear General , I 'm // still Commander-in-Chief of the Army . " 7 // The general complied , but only partially . The new downriver site // was accepted  --  an unsightly shack-ridden wasteland called Hell 's Bottom . It // was a former airfield and railroad yard littered with abandoned tin hangars and // rusted-out boxcars . But without Roosevelt 's knowledge , the general declined // to reduce the size of the Building , and with the help of Virginia congressmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction permanent . // By then the Building 's architects , led by G. Edwin Bergstrom , who had also // designed the Hollywood Bowl , had completed drawings for the upriver site at // Arlington Farms . The original design for that now abandoned location called // for a simple rectangular footprint , but access roads required one corner of the // rectangle to be cut off , leaving an asymmetrical five-sided building . What // Bergstrom did was to even up the five sides , producing  --  voil ?  --  the // Pentagon . When the site was moved downriver , the polygonal shape was no // longer required by the limits of the roadways , but such was the hurried pace // of the project that the architects did not change the design . Eventually // Bergstrom and others would mythologize the pentagonal form of the War // Department headquarters as an echo of Napoleonic-era fortress // architecture.8 The true , entirely mundane origin of the design would be // forgotten . // Over the next year , more than a hundred architects and nearly as // many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangars , turning out drawings for the more than fifteen thousand laborers , // who often did n't wait for specs . Pearl Harbor was attacked almost three // months after groundbreaking , and from then on the already quickened pace of // construction was redoubled . " How big should I make that beam across the // third floor ? " one architect asked another , who replied , " I do n't know . They // installed it yesterday . " 9 // * * * // Supervising all of this work was a Corps of Engineers colonel named Leslie // R. Groves , who was forty-five years old when appointed to head up Pentagon // construction . He was a burly , corpulent man whose belly protruded like lips // over his brass-buckled belt.10 A man of the job , Groves was an important // military manager . In charge of the Army 's crash building program across the // country ( in 1940 the Corps 's construction budget skyrocketed from $20 // million to $10 billion ) , he had already purchased half the lumber in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Battle of Wounded // Knee , in 1890 , which marked the end of the Indian wars , Groves had spent // part of his childhood at Fort Apache , Arizona , living in the house of a man // famous for killing Indians.12 His lifelong hero was General William Tecumseh // Sherman , whose " march to the sea " across Georgia legitimized the spirit of // total war , which after the CivilWar was unleashed on Native Americans . // Groves began as a student at the Massachusetts Institute of // Technology , but when his older brother died in 1914  --  of a disease // contracted at the same Arlington Farms that would much later be the first // site proposed for the Pentagon  --  Groves transferred to West Point . From // then on he wore a mustache , which did nothing to soften his stern , unfriendly // demeanor . Work in the Corps of Engineers was essentially a matter of // management , and Groves proved himself again and again . By the time he // was put in charge of Pentagon construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicaragua , developing plans for a second ( never undertaken ) // canal across the Central American isthmus.13 // As the Pentagon neared completion , Groves was promoted to // brigadier general , although for a reason having to do with his next project , not // this one . Among his last decisions in Arlington was one that provided the // new Building with separate eating and lavatory accommodations for " colored // people " and whites . The dining areas for blacks would be in the basement , // and on the other floors , at each corridor junction , double toilet facilities would // be built , separated by race . When President Roosevelt visited the Building // shortly before its dedication , he asked why there were so many lavatories // ( more than two hundred ) , and he was told that the Army was abiding by // Virginia 's racial laws . Roosevelt had issued an order prohibiting such // discrimination throughout the U.S. military only six months earlier , and he // told Groves to get rid of the Whites Only signs at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president , the Pentagon would for a long // time be the only place in Virginia where segregation was not allowed.14 // Within days of Roosevelt 's visit to the new War Department // headquarters , at an understated ceremony presided over by Secretary of War // Henry L. Stimson , the Pentagon was dedicated . Wartime exigencies // eclipsed such a formality in the memoirs and memories of witnesses . Honor // guards would have mounted battle flags in mahogany stands , and portraits of // former secretaries of war would have been unveiled . One imagines the Army // band playing martial music .
