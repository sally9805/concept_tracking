HAVE YOU SEEN US ? <p> THE FACES OF THE TWO BOYS WERE EVERYWHERE : stapled to roadside telephone poles , tacked to bulletin boards in Laundromats and grocery stores , taped to the sides of cash registers in convenience stores . <p> HAVE YOU SEEN US ? <p> The pictures were grainy and blurred from repeated copying on creaky , overused public machines . The photo had been taken at a birthday party or some other festive occasion . The younger boy wore a cheap paper party hat with a tuft of plastic streamer jutting from the top . The older boy had his arm around the younger one 's shoulders . The gap-toothed grins on the boys ' faces contrasted grotesquely with the desperation of the hand-lettered caption . <p> HAVE YOU SEEN US ? <p> Sanders 's eyes flickered over the familiar poster as he waited in line . He knew who the boys were ; everyone knew by now . The missing Powell boys , Evan and Earl , had seized as much news airtime as a dozen small wars . They had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " an unknown assailant . " There were also pictures of the unknown assailant , a drawing made by a police artist from the description of witnesses who had seen him talking to one of the boys . The boys were widely presumed to be dead , although no one would actually say this , least of all on the local news . <p> Sanders turned his attention back to the counter . The clerk was a bulky teenaged girl with bored eyes , a sullen mouth , and a gold stud through her tongue that flashed in the glare of the fluorescent lights when she spoke , which was n't any more often than she could help . Her demeanor indicated a stubborn resistance to the idea of hurry . She rang up the gas purchase for the man in front of Sanders with short , erratic stabs of her fat fingers on the cash register keys . <p> " Mbackseeus , " she mumbled at the customer , dismissing him from her consciousness as she said it and turning to Sanders in the same motion . " Atbeall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack of Nekot crackers on the counter . " No , " he said , " I need to fill up on pump number four . Supreme . " <p> " Leave the gas card , " the girl said . <p> " Do n't have one , " Sanders said . <p> The girl looked at him in exasperation . " You got ta come back an ' pay , then . " <p> " I know , " Sanders said . " But you wo n't turn the pump on until I come in and ask . " <p> The girl heaved a heavy sigh and turned to the console that controlled the gas pumps . She punched the keys to turn on the pumps as if she were imagining poking Sanders in the eyes . She turned back . " Well ? " she said , as if she were offended that Sanders was still there . <p> " I want to pay for the drink and the crackers now . " <p> " You got ta pay all at once , " the girl said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There some kind of problem , Alison ? " a voice said . <p> Sanders turned . The man standing a few feet away was about the same height as Sanders , but he was slim and wiry where Sanders was stocky . It was hard to tell his age ; he looked about forty at first glance , but his skin was lined and creased by long exposure to the outdoors and pockmarked with ancient acne scars . He had thinning sandy hair and a neatly trimmed mustache . He was dressed in a light brown deputy sheriff ' s uniform . The gold star gleamed on his right breast pocket . There was a rectangular gold name badge over the other pocket . Sanders could make out the raised black lettering against the gold background : T. BUCK-THORN . <p> " He 's got to pay for the stuff all at once , " Alison complained to the deputy . <p> " I 'm thirsty , " Sanders said . " I want to drink my drink while I fill the tank . I do n't know why this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alison , " the deputy said , " I 'll walk out and keep an eye on him . I 'll make sure he does n't drive off without paying , okay ? " <p> " Well " the girl said doubtfully . People had begun lining up behind Sanders , and the way they were shuffling their feet and looking annoyed decided the question . " Okay , " she said , giving Sanders a look of smoldering disgust as she rang him up . <p> Buckthorn was right behind Sanders as he walked out to his truck . It was a Ford F250 , brand-new . Sanders got a new truck every year . He worried sometimes that maybe it was too conspicuous , but it was the one luxury he allowed himself . In another time and place , he had ridden a motorcycle , but pickups helped him blend into the landscape these days . Plus , the road he lived on tended to get tricky in bad weather , the kind of tricky that called for four-wheel drive . <p> Sanders popped the top on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas nozzle off the hook of the pump . As he started pumping the gas , the deputy leaned against the metal light pole between the two banks of pumps . He took a toothpick out of the pocket of his uniform shirt and stuck it in his mouth . Sanders did n't look directly at him , but in his peripheral vision , he could see the man watching him . <p> " Alison 's a sweet girl , " Buckthorn said to Sanders . " She just does n't want Jeff  --  that 's the owner  --  to get mad at her . He 's kind of particular about how he wants things done . " <p> " Uh-huh , " Sanders said . <p> " See , I know Alison . I know her family . I try to know everybody around here . " <p> " I 'm sure they appreciate that , " Sanders said . <p> The deputy scanned him for a few moments , looking for sarcasm . " Thing is , Mr. Sanders , I do n't know you . And what bothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about you . Beth Anne at the Pine Lake Realty says you pay your rent on the old Jacobs farm in cash every month . Y'do n't see that much . And you do n't seem to have a job , so I 'm figuring you 're pretty well off . " <p> " I have a trust fund , " Sanders said . " My uncle died and left it to me . " <p> " Lucky you , " Buckthorn said . " But then , like you said back there , you do n't have any credit cards . That 's kind of odd , do n't ya think ? " <p> There was a clunk as the gasoline reached the level of the nozzle and it shut off . Sanders pulled the nozzle from the intake and set it back in its niche on the pump . " You do keep pretty well informed . Some folks might call that invasion of privacy . " <p> Buckthorn shifted the toothpick to the other side of his mouth and smiled . " I call it good community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't mind me checking up . Makes ' em feel safer . ' Course , they 've got nothin ' to hide . You got something to hide , Mr. Sanders ? " <p> Sanders began walking back toward the store . He saw the girl 's pale face staring at him through the glass of the front window . It showed the most interest he had seen in her face yet . <p> He heard Buckthorn 's footsteps behind him as he reached the door . He stopped and turned . " What do you want , Deputy ? " <p> Buckthorn stopped and crossed his arms across his chest . " I want to know who you really are , Mr. Sanders . I want to know why you 're here . " <p> Sanders turned back to the door . " I 'm here because I like peace and quiet , " he said . He took hold of the door handle and looked steadily at the deputy . <p> Buckthorn uncrossed his arms . " Well , then , we should get along okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Have a good evenin ' , Mr. Sanders . " He flicked the toothpick into the nearby trash receptacle and walked off toward his cruiser , parked at the edge of the concrete lot . <p> Sanders took a deep breath and went inside . He tried to ignore the girl 's stare as he paid for the gas . He felt her eyes on his back as he walked to the truck . <p> The deputy 's car was pulling out as Sanders got behind the wheel . He started his own vehicle and pulled out behind , careful to keep below the posted speed limit . The little store was located on a country road a few miles outside of town . He pulled up to the stop sign at a crossroads . Straight would take him onto Main Street in the little town of Pine Lake . The left turn took him out the long two-lane country road to his house . The deputy 's car pulled away , going straight toward town . <p> Sanders noticed his hands were shaking . Nobody was coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he calmed down . Just a redneck deputy throwing his weight around , he told himself . It 's nothing . <p> As he sat there , a white van came down the road from his left . It was unmarked , nondescript . If it had n't been the only vehicle on the road , Sanders would n't even have noticed it . As he watched , the van went through the intersection and pulled over to the shoulder . Sanders saw that the rear windows of the van were covered with cardboard taped over the inside . His brow furrowed slightly . <p> Suddenly , the piece of cardboard was ripped away from the left rear window . Sanders found himself staring into a face he had seen before . He had just seen it on a poster in the store . He had seen it on every news brief and local news show on TV . It was the face of Earl Powell . <p> The boy 's face was contorted with terror . He mouthed what looked like the word " help " before an unseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was replaced . There was a brief pause ; then the van jerked back into motion . <p> Sanders sat for a moment , paralyzed with shock and uncertainty . He wondered if he had really seen the boy 's face . His hand seemed to move of its own accord as he put the truck in gear . He fell in behind the van , following at a good distance . He passed the driveway to his house . He thought for a moment about stopping and calling the cops . Then he remembered Buckthorn and changed his mind . He did n't want to have to deal with the deputy again . He was n't sure what he was going to do , but he reached behind the passenger seat and pulled out a black pistol , a Glock 9 mm . <p> TIM BUCKTHORN glanced in his rearview as he pulled away , watching Sanders sit at the crossroads for a moment . He saw the truck turn left after a white van passed . His fingers drummed restlessly on the wheel as he returned his eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sanders . There was something about the man that still bothered him . It was illogical , he knew ; he had never had cause to arrest Sanders or even suspect him of anything wrong . The man paid his taxes , took good care of his home , and kept pretty much to himself . Maybe that was it , Buckthorn thought . After all , did n't everyone say that after their neighbor turned out to have been a serial killer ? He was a quiet guy , kept to himself Buckthorn shook his head as his cruiser bumped over the railroad tracks at the edge of town . Now you 're thinking crazy , Tim , he thought . He glanced left at the pine-fringed lake that had given the town its name . The sunlight glittered silver on the water , bringing a smile to Buckthorn 's lips . The town had once been a prime vacation spot , the railroad bringing tourists from north and south to stay in the massive resort hotel that overlooked the big lake . An outdoor bandstand hosted big-name acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said by the town 's older residents to have played there on several occasions . The place had fallen on hard times after World War II and had closed its doors in 1952 . The once-grand structure had fallen slowly into rot and ruin , becoming a place children dared each other to sneak into , the biggest danger being that their parents whipped their behinds if they caught them taking the dare . A careless vagrant had burned it down with him in it in 1972 , and the old bandstand had been torn down not long after . Now only the foundation stood among the tall grass near the water . The town 's fortunes had also declined , the resort community bypassed by time and the interstate . Downtown had been struggling for years , with only the yearly Bass Festival and its related fishing tournament drawing tourists and money to the little community . Still , Buckthorn thought as the country road widened and turned into the tree lined avenue of Main Street , it was a good place to live . There were good people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . This is n't my business . It 's not my job <p> The phrase brought back a sudden memory , so vivid it was almost like a physical blow . <p> A pair of frightened eyes in a dark face , a high giggle , a voice behind him speaking in a high-pitched parody of a Mexican accent : " Ees not my yob , man " <p> He steered with his elbows for a moment , racking the slide to chamber the first round . He saw the van ahead of him slow , then turn right . It looked for a moment as if the driver meant to steer the van into the trees that lined both sides of the road . Sanders noticed a deeply rutted dirt driveway coming out of the trees . The van disappeared as if swallowed by the woods . He drove past , not slowing down . He had passed the place before . The drive had been so overgrown , he had always assumed it was abandoned . <p> A half mile up the road , he stopped and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hidden driveway and pulled in slowly . Branches scraped against the side of the truck . Gon na scratch my paint , Sanders thought . He stopped the truck and killed the engine . As he got out , he could hear the van on the road ahead , gears grinding as it tried to negotiate the corrugated road . " Dumb fucker , " Sanders said out loud . " Should 've got a four-wheel drive . " He heard the engine stop . A door slammed . Soft clay mixed with pebbles squelched softly under Sanders 's boots as he crept up the drive . <p> There was a small clearing at the end of the drive . Sanders faded back against a tree to scope things out . The van was parked about fifty feet away , in front of a single-wide trailer that looked at least thirty years old . The supports in the middle had given way , and it sagged in the center . Several of the windows were broken out and boarded up with plywood . The propane tank leaning at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as if it had n't been inhabited in years . <p> Sanders heard the panel door on the other side of the van open . He heard a male voice grunt with effort , then a muffled squeal of pain . <p> " Shut up , you little bitch , " a gravelly voice said . " I told you to stay still back there . Now you 're going to get what 's coming to you . " Another grunt and another muffled sound of agony . Sanders heard the trailer door open , then bang shut . He started to move , but the sound of the door opening again stopped him in his tracks . He 's getting the other kid , Sanders thought . <p> When Sanders heard the door slam shut again , he moved across the clearing . He crouched for a moment behind the van . From inside the trailer , he heard a man shouting , the same male voice he had heard earlier . He could n't make out the words . He heard a sharp crack , then a cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door hung crookedly in its warped frame . A set of rickety wooden steps rose unsteadily toward the doorway , leaving a gap of several inches . Sanders sprang onto the steps and yanked the door open . <p> The first thing that struck him was the smell . The roof of the ruined trailer had leaked rain onto the cheap carpeting , giving the place a musty wet-dog odor . Overlaying that was a sharp smell of fear-sweat and body fluids , a throat-closing stench of misery and pain sealed into the small space . Sanders nearly gagged as he stepped through the doorway . <p> The door opened into what had been the trailer 's living room . Someone had hammered sheets of plywood across the inside of all the windows , leaving the room as close and dark as a dungeon cell . The only illumination was provided by the harsh light of a battery-powered lamp that hung by a bungee cord from a dead ceiling fixture . The lamp swung as the violence of Sanders 's entrance caused the rickety trailer to rock slightly . The illumination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surreal , hellish quality . <p> The man was bent over a small struggling figure on the floor . The boy had his hands fastened behind him with duct tape . More strips of the silver tape secured his ankles . The man had one hand hooked in the waistband of the boy 's sweatpants , working them down over his buttocks . The other hand held a short knife that glittered and winked brightly in the unstable light . Sanders briefly registered another bound figure lying against the far wall . The man stood up , his eyes showing wide and white with shock in the jittering gloom . His mouth opened as if to say something . Sanders 's first shot struck him in the chest , the impact shoving him up straighter for the second shot to drive him backward . The third shot went straight into his open mouth and sprayed blood and fragments of bone onto the wall behind . Another rank smell combined with the sudden coppery tang of blood in the air as the man 's bowels and bladder let go . He collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanders crossed the room and stood over the man . He felt his heart pounding . His breath came in ragged gasps as he held the gun on the unmoving figure . After a long moment , he turned to the boy on the floor . <p> It was the older one ; he could n't remember if it was Evan or Earl . The kid looked up at Sanders . His eyes were wide above the duct tape wound around his head . Sanders bent down . " This may hurt a little , " he said as he started looking for the end of the tape to rip it off . The boy lay terrified , unmoving . Sanders located the end and started to pull . It looked like the kidnapper had used almost an entire roll of tape on the boy 's head alone . Sanders saw the knife lying a few feet away . He decided to try to cut through the tape . He bent over , put down the gun , and picked up the knife . The boy screamed behind the tape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Take it easy . I 'm not going to hurt you . " The boy was beyond reassurance . He arched and bucked so violently that Sanders was afraid he 'd hurt himself . " Okay , okay , " he said . " Look , I 'm putting it down , okay ? " He dropped the knife back to the floor . The boy quieted slightly . <p> " Jesus , ' " Sanders said under his breath . He looked over at the other bound figure . The kid 's eyes were open , but they stared straight ahead , unseeing . Sanders went over and knelt down . He could see the rapid rise and fall of the small chest . The boy was alive , but out of it . Sanders hesitated for a moment , wondering what to do next . He bent down and started unwinding the tape from around the younger kid 's head . It took some time , and the boy quivered slightly every time the tape took out a clump of hair . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry . Sorry . " Finally , he pulled the last strip off the kid 's mouth . He still had n't moved . Sanders pulled the tape from his hands , then his ankles . The boy immediately curled up in a ball against the wall , his arms wrapped around his knees , not looking at Sanders , not looking at anything . Sanders turned back to the first kid . " Okay , " he said . " That took a while , and I need to get out of here pretty soon . You can see I 'm not here to hurt you . I can use the knife to cut you loose , or you can wait for your brother to snap out of it and unwrap you . " He picked up the knife and raised his eyebrows questioningly . The older boy hesitated , then nodded . It took Sanders only a minute or so to cut him loose . The boy immediately crawled to his brother . " Earl , " the boy whispered . " Earl , come on , talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , " Sanders said . " Let 's get outside . " <p> The older kid  --  it had to be Evan  --  looked up . " Are you a policeman ? " <p> " No , " Sanders said . <p> He walked over to them . " Come on , let 's get him outside . It stinks in here . " He helped Evan get the unresisting Earl to his feet . They started walking him outside . Evan swallowed as he looked at the body on the floor . <p> " You shot the bad guy , " Evan said . " Does n't that make you the good guy ? " <p> " Not exactly , " Sanders said . " It 's kind of complicated . " They guided Earl down the stairs . Evan blinked in the sudden light . Earl still did n't respond . <p> Evan looked at Sanders . " That guy , " he said in a whisper . " That bad guy he hurt my brother . He hurt him real bad . " A single tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , but but I was too little " His lip started quivering . <p> Sanders knelt down to look him in the eye . " Kid , " he said . " Evan . Look at me , man . " The kid 's lip stopped quivering . <p> " Evan , " Sanders said . " It 's real important that no one knows I was here . You ca n't tell anybody about me . " <p> Evan 's look of despair turned to confusion . " Why ? " he said . " You saved us . You shot the bad guy . " <p> Sanders nodded . " Right . So you guys owe me , right ? I did you a favor , you do me one , okay ? Even Steven . " <p> The invocation of the magic words of childhood justice got through to Evan . He nodded . Then his brow furrowed . " How are we going to get home ? " he whispered . His lip started to quiver again . <p> " Shit , " Sanders muttered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked over to the van and pulled the passenger side door open . The floor was littered with fast food wrappers and empty plastic bottles . There was a hole in the dash where some-body had pulled out the radio . Sanders finally located what he 'd been looking for . He reached over and picked up a small black cell phone from the dash . It was one of the cheap models typically given out for free to people who signed a one year contract for cellular service . He handed the phone to Evan . " You know how to use one of these ? " Evan looked dubious . Sanders flipped the phone open . It was on , the indicator light showing a good signal . " Look , just dial 911 . You know how to do that , right ? Then hit this send button . When someone comes on the line , tell them that you 're on Sutter Church Road . Can you remember that ? " <p> " Summer " Evan began . <p> " Sutter , " Sanders corrected him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number , but tell them about the trailer here . Somebody 'll figure it out . " <p> Evan looked alarmed . " Where are you going to be ? You 're not going to leave us ! " <p> " It 'll only be for a short time , kid , " Sanders said . He started backing down the road toward the woods where his truck was hidden . " Go ahead , " he called out . " Make the call . Your brother needs a doctor . And remember , I was never here . " He saw the kid start to dial . Sanders turned and bolted down the road toward his truck . <p> Excerpted from Breaking Cover by J. D. Rhoades <p> Copyright 2008 by J. D.
