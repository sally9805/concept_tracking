I Am the Messenger By Markus Zusak Random House Markus Zusak the holdup The gunman is useless . I know it . He knows it . The whole bank knows it . Even my best mate , Marvin , knows it , and he 's more useless than the gunman . The worst part about the whole thing is that Marv 's car is standing outside in a fifteen-minute parking zone . We 're all facedown on the floor , and the car 's only got a few minutes left on it . " I wish this bloke 'd hurry up , " I mention . " I know , " Marv whispers back . " This is outrageous . " His voice rises from the depths of the floor . " I 'll be getting a fine because of this useless bastard . I ca n't afford another fine , Ed . " " The car 's not even worth it . " " What ? " Marv looks over at me now . I can sense he 's getting uptight . Offended . If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting shit on his car . He repeats the question . " What did you say , Ed ? " " I said , " I whisper , " it is n't even worth the fine , Marv . " " Look , " he says , " I 'll take a lot of things , Ed , but . . . " I tune out of what he 's saying because , quite frankly , once Marv gets going about his car , it 's downright pain-in-the-arse material . He goes on and on , like a kid , and he 's just turned twenty , for Jesus ' sake . He goes on for another minute or so , until I have to cut him off . " Marv , " I point out , " the car 's an embarrassment , okay ? It does n't even have a hand brake-it 's sitting out there with two bricks behind the back wheels . " I 'm trying to keep my voice as quiet as possible . " Half the time you do n't even bother locking it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can collect the insurance . " " It is n't insured . " " Exactly . " " NRMA said it was n't worth it . " " It 's understandable . " That 's when the gunman turns around and shouts , " Who 's talkin ' back there ? " Marv does n't care . He 's worked up about the car . " You do n't complain when I give you a lift to work , Ed , you miserable upstart . " " Upstart ? What the hell 's an upstart ? " " I said shut up back there ! " the gunman shouts again . " Hurry up then ! " Marv roars back at him . He 's in no mood now . No mood at all . He 's facedown on the floor of the bank . The bank 's being robbed . It 's abnormally hot for spring . The air-conditioning 's broken down . His car 's just been insulted . Old Marv 's at the end of his tether , or his wit 's end . Whatever you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain flattened on the worn-out , dusty blue carpet of the bank , and Marv and I are looking at each other with eyes that argue . Our mate Ritchie 's over at the Lego table , half under it , lying among all the pieces that scattered when the gunman came in yelling , screaming , and shaking . Audrey 's just behind me . Her foot 's on my leg , making it go numb . The gunman 's gun is pointed at the nose of some poor girl behind the counter . Her name tag says Misha . Poor Misha . She 's shivering nearly as bad as the gunman as she waits for some zitty twenty-nine-year-old fella with a tie and sweat patches under his arms to fill the bag with money . " I wish this bloke 'd hurry up , " Marv speaks . " I said that already , " I tell him . " So what ? I ca n't make a comment of my own ? " " Get your foot off me , " I tell Audrey . " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off me-my leg 's going numb . " She moves it . Reluctantly . " Thanks . " The gunman turns around and shouts his question for the last time . " Who 's the bastard talking ? " The thing to note with Marv is that he 's problematic at the best of times . Argumentative . Less than amiable . He 's the type of friend you find yourself constantly arguing with-especially when it comes to his shitbox Falcon . He 's also a completely immature arsehole when he 's in the mood . He calls out in a jocular manner , " It 's Ed Kennedy , sir . It 's Ed who 's talking ! " " Thanks a lot ! " I say . ( My full name 's Ed Kennedy . I 'm nineteen . I 'm an underage cabdriver . I 'm typical of many of the young men you see in this suburban outpost of the city-not a whole lot of prospects or possibility . That aside , I read more books than I should , and I 'm decidedly crap at sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Well , shut up , Ed ! " the gunman screams . Marv smirks . " Or I 'll come over there and shoot the arse off you ! " It 's like being in school again and your sadistic math teacher 's barking orders at you from the front of the room , even though he could n't care less and he 's waiting for the bell so he can go home and drink beer and get fat in front of the telly . I look at Marv . I want to kill him . " You 're twenty years old , for Christ 's sake . Are you trying to get us killed ? " " Shut up , Ed ! " The gunman 's voice is louder this time . I whisper even quieter . " If I get shot , I 'm blaming you . You know that , do n't you ? " " I said shut up , Ed ! " " Everything 's just a big joke , is n't it , Marv ? " " Right , that 's it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marches over to us , fed up as all buggery . When he arrives we all look up at him . Marv . Audrey . Me . And all the other hopeless articles like us sprawled out on the floor . The end of the gun touches the bridge of my nose . It makes it itchy . I do n't scratch it . The gunman looks back and forth between Marv and me . Through the stocking on his face I can see his ginger whiskers and acne scars . His eyes are small and he has big ears . He 's most likely robbing the bank as a payback on the world for winning the ugliness prize at his local fete three years running . " So which one of you 's Ed ? " " Him , " I answer , pointing to Marv . " Oh no you do n't , " Marv counters , and I can tell by the look on his face that he is n't as afraid as he should be . He knows we 'd both be dead by now if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the stocking-faced man and says , " Hang on a sec . . . . " He scratches his jawline . " You look familiar . " " Okay , " I admit , " I 'm Ed . " But the gunman 's too busy listening to what Marv has to say for himself . " Marv , " I whisper loudly , " shut up .
