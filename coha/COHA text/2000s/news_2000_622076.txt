<p> WHAT ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS ' SCANDALS ? Editor  --  As a Republican , I am very gratified that the state GOP has fully joined the investigation into the alleged unethical , if not criminal , behavior of Republican Chuck Quackenbush . Republican Assemblyman Tom McClintock has gone so far as to imply that Quackenbush may face impeachment . It is a positive sign to see a political party rise above petty politics and conduct itself correctly . <p> I also am gratified to see The Chronicle pursue this story with such vigor . Headline after headline details every nuance of the situation . Important questions are being raised . Pursuit of the truth and total disclosure are being sought after by reporters and editorial staff . Good work ! <p> Let me ask these questions , however . Considering the rash of scandals put upon us by Bill Clinton and Al Gore , the latest being missing e-mails and the apparent obstruction of justice by the Justice Department ( i.e. , LaBella memos , campaign finance interference ) why has n't The Chronicle shown the same attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chronicle . Where is the pursuit of truth ? Total disclosure ? Why are n't there any Democratic leaders speaking out ? Why are they trying to bury the story ? <p> I guess only Republican scandals are worth pursuing . <p> STEVE BOGEL <p> Benicia <p> . <p> FOOD WARNING <p> EDItor  --  The federal government has approved irradiating practically all edible foods in order to kill bacteria and increase shelf life . Irradiated food has caused tumors , kidney damage , immune and reproductive problems , chromosomal damage , cancer-causing formaldehyde , benzene and lipid peroxides and creates free radicals , which are implicated in many diseases . Also , it destroys essential nutrients , vitamins , beneficial enzymes and microorganisms , many of which block the growth of harmful bacteria and substances . <p> There have been no long-term health studies of people who eat irradiated food . The FDA based its approval of irradiated food on only five animal studies of 441 studies submitted . The federal government has done everything to prop up this once-dying industry , including diminishing labeling requirements , streamlining new irradiation approvals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains want to sell irradiated food at retail but are waiting for consumer reaction to Wal-Mart 's test-marketing of irradiated beef . Major meat packers have announced plans to irradiate meat . For information on irradiated food and what you can do about it , visit Web sites www.citizen.org and www.purefood.org . <p> BOB DeBOLT <p> Santa Cruz <p> . <p> THERE 'S NO ALTERNATIVE <p> Editor  --  In Edith Melendres ' June 8 letter , " Gore 's Eco-Schemes are Scary Stuff , " she asserts that Vice President Al Gore , in his book , " Earth in the Balance , " made the elimination of the internal combustion engine a goal . " So the question begs , " she writes , " and replace it with what , Al ? On the campaign trail , Gore is mum about this position . " <p> Frankly , Ms. Melendres , if you have not yet figured out that we have to eliminate the internal combustion engine , you are living in an ecological fantasy land . Two factors make the elimination essential to our survival : 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 2 ) the burning of those fossil fuels contributes to the greenhouse effect , which will eventually render our planet unsuitable for life . <p> What part of that is n't easily understandable by 10-year-olds ? <p> As to Gore not giving his answers , I would suggest that he is the wrong person to consult . You should be writing to Livermore Lab , MIT , Ford Motors and any other entity that should be involved in researching and developing alternative transportation . <p> PAUL W. BAKER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> RENTED FOR A SONG <p> Editor  --  If the Presidio is so concerned with becoming a self-supporting national park , why is it letting George Lucas take 23 acres for a song ? Instead of raising the rents of the hundreds of national parks employees that were lured to the park with the promise of low rents , perhaps the Presidio Trust should charge Lucasfilm more than $5 million a year for this incredibly desirable land . <p> A poll of real estate firms in the city ( especially Shorenstein ) would reveal that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I am sure that Lucasfilm could afford to pay more . If the Presidio Trust is going to allow Hollywood to take over part of a national park , with the attendant parking and security woes that will surely arise , they should at least ask for a lot more than $5 million a year . <p> KEVIN KEYSER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> NO MORE TRUCK ROUTES <p> Editor  --  The public meeting sponsored by Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett and Sen. Liz Figueroa on June 8 in San Leandro provided all the reasons why large trucks should be denied use of I-580 between Highway 238 and Oakland . For 37 years , this stretch of highway has achieved its function of safe and efficient traffic movement through one of the most scenic suburban foothill drives in the United States . It is the only such strip remaining in the nation 's interstate highway system restricted to autos and light trucks . This rare treasure in our own front yard is not deserving of the rumbling , haze and effluvium the trucking industry has brought to other urban expressways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If Admiral Chester Nimitz had known that Interstate 880 would be named in his honor , he would have unhesitatingly surrendered to the Japanese . " <p> Interstate 880 , which houses the East Bay 's warehousing and distribution centers , currently functions as the appropriate route for these powerful , heavily laden big rigs , and I would like to remind the committee that there is no logical " destination " whatsoever for large trucks on that section of I-580 referred to in Assembly Bill 500 . <p> The insightful energy that Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett and other legislators have brought to bear on protecting this unique stretch of highway should be loudly supported by every California citizen , including the California Senate Transportation Committee . <p> PAUL A. NELSON <p> Castro Valley <p> . <p> PRESIDIO VISION ' <p> Editor  --  William K. Reilly will undoubtedly classify us as critics of the Presidio Trust , but the Sierra Club is dismayed by his June 7 Open Forum piece in The Chronicle . Just a month after the trust stated that it " continues to use ( the Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its decision-making , " Mr. Reilly blithely informed readers that the Presidio Trust is not going to comply with the publicly supported vision for the Presidio developed by the National Park Service . A vision , he failed to note , that calls for creating " a global center dedicated to addressing the world 's most critical environmental , social and cultural challenges . " Surprising , also , is Mr. Reilly 's assertion that the trust " has a different idea " for the Presidio  --  that it become essentially a Silicon Valley annex . <p> The trust has told us in the past that it does not have an alternative vision . Indeed , it has just announced it is beginning a " community-oriented process " for updating the Park Service 's plan . If members of the trust board have already decided what they want to see at the Presidio , this new planning effort wo n't help them develop the public trust and support they must have to succeed . <p> Mr. Reilly wants trust critics to " lighten up . " We 'll do that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitments jut wo n't cut it in a national park . <p> REBECCA EVANS <p> Presidio Committee <p> Sierra Club <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> JOBS ARE OUT THERE <p> Editor  --  The residents of Hunters Point must realize that Mayor Brown and the city are working very diligently and as quickly as possible to prepare the site for development . This will be one of the largest sites toward the expansion of the city in the last 75 years . Hopefully , Mayor Brown will be able to start construction before he leaves office . <p> Those residents who are complaining about jobs should read the Sunday want-ad section . They will find that jobs are easy to find , especially since the United States is experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in the last 50 years . <p> ARTHUR J. ZANELLO <p> San Francisco
