// VENUS AND JUPITER are brilliant lights low in the west at dusk . They are converging all month toward a stunning , close pairing at month 's end . Mars is the increasingly brilliant campfire-colored object rising in the late evening . Saturn and Mercury make an appearance low in the east-northeast during morning twilight in the second half of August . Venus and Jupiter start the month a huge 31 apart in the dusk . But this separation decreases steadily during August , making them gradually more and more spectacular together . Venus is always much brighter than Jupiter , but in early August it sits far to the lower right of Jupiter in the western sky . Venus happens to appear at about the same altitude at each sunset this month , and it sets about 1 hours after the Sun . So it is Jupiter that comes into view a little lower each night , and consequently a little closer to its brilliant sister . By August 22nd they are only 10 apart . On August 3lst Jupiter glows just 1 about the width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venus . Their closest approach to each other in the sky is the next day . // A third , far less prominent light twinkles to the left of the Venus-Jupiter pairing at month 's end . It is lstmagnitude Spica , three magnitudes dimmer than Jupiter and five magnitudes dimmer than Venus ( that is , 1/100 as bright ) . Spica is 11 from Jupiter at the start of the month and 6 from it by the end of August . Pluto can be observed in the south-southwest after evening twilight ends . Neptune reaches opposition to the Sun on the night of August 7-8 , as does Uranus on August 31-September 1 . These last two planets are therefore visible virtually all night , being highest in the south around 1 a.m. daylightsaving time . Charts for locating all three can be found on page 72 of the June issue . Neptune shines at magnitude 7.8 in north-central Capricornus , and Uranus at magnitude 5.7 in eastern Aquarius . Even when closest to Earth , as they are this month , their bluegreen globes appear no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ' wide ( Uranus ) . Mars rises 2 to 3 minutes earlier each night , coming up around 10:30 p.m. for viewers at midnorthern latitudes by month 's end . As Earth begins to catch up to Mars , the red planet is becoming a truly impressive naked-eye and telescopic sight . It brightens to magnitude -1 by the end of August , when it shines in Aries 15 from the Pleiades . // This month , the best time to catch the steadiest telescopic view of Mars is still at morning twilight , when the planet is highest in the south . Its slightly gibbous globe swells to 14 ' ' ' by month 's end , large enough to reveal quite a few darkish surface markings on a good morning . The southern hemisphere of Mars is tilted toward Earth now , and on August 16th that hemisphere experiences its summer solstice - just one month after Mars was at perihelion ( closest to the Sun in space ) . Thus the south polar ice cap of Mars should already be small and fragmentary - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east-northeast in morning twilight during the second half of August . Saturn was at conjunction with the Sun on July 23rd , as Mercury is on August 6th . Trailing Mercury leaps up and manages to get as close as 5 directly below Saturn on August 18th . On that date Saturn shines at magnitude +0.3 and Mercury at +1.1 , so you will probably need binoculars to glimpse the latter planet in the brightening sky below Saturn . // The curved arrows indicate each planet 's movement during the month , as if you were looking down on the inner solar system from the constellation Ophiuchus . // Fortunately , Mercury brightens rapidly thereafter , reaching magnitude - 0.2 by August 24th . That is the day Mercury attains greatest elongation , 18 from the Sun while it is still only 8 from Saturn . Mercury is then rising about 1 hours , and Saturn more than 2 hours , before sunup ( at mid-northern latitudes ) . Mercury continues to gain luster through the final days of August , but Saturn begins to pull away , appearing higher each morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun , and optical aid shows the Beehive Star Cluster , M44 , only 2 to the lower left of the ringed planet . The Moon is a crescent at dusk on August 7th , when East Coast viewers see it only 2 from Venus , and those on the West Coast just 1 from that planet . The lunar crescent actually occults Venus as seen from parts of Alaska shortly before sunset , with the planet disappearing and reappearing at these Alaska Daylight Times : Nome , 8:53 p.m. , 9:06 p.m. ; Anchorage , 8:53 , 9:29 ; Fairbanks , 8:45 , 9:22 ; Juneau , 8:57 , 9:37 . Instead of an occultation , skywatchers in Hawaii get to see a spectacular near-miss ( 10 ' ' ) as evening twilight deepens into night . A thicker Moon brushes near Jupiter on August 9th and near Spica on the 10th . The next few nights , the Moon sets early enough to permit excellent viewing of the Perseid meteor shower in the predawn hours ( see page 65 ) . The Moon is waning gibbous when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crescent when it rises upper left of Saturn before dawn on August 31st. // The Sun and planets are located for mid-August ; arrows show motion throughout the month . The Moon is plotted for evening dates in the Americas when it is waxing ( right side illuminated ) or full , and morning dates when waning ( left side ) . It is shown on the nights nearest first quarter , full , and last quarter , as well as on dates of selected crescent and gibbous phases . " Local time of transit " tells when objects cross the meridian at midmonth ; transits occur an hour later on the 1st and an hour earlier at month 's end .

Sidebar Sky positions . In Sun , Moon , and Planets , most descriptions that relate to your horizon or zenith including directions like up , down , right , and left - are written for skywatchers in the world 's midnorthern latitudes .
