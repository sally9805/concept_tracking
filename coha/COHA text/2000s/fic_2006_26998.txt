Tuesday , February 11 , 6 p.m. , The limo on the way home from princess lessons Today when I walked into my princess lessons with Grandmre after school , there was this totally creepy-looking guy occupying the pink brocade settee where I normally sit ( because it 's nearest the bowl of sugared almonds that I sneak whenever Grandmre is n't looking , even though they are n't actually that good , like not candy- or chocolate- coated or anything , but beggars ca n't be choosers , and why do old people always have such sucky candy , anyway ? ) , and I was all , " Who are you ? " because this dude had on one of those monochromatic tie-and-shirt thingies , like a TV talk show host or mafioso might wear , and that is not the kind of person you 'd expect to see sitting in a dowager princess 's living room suite at the Plaza . I mean , not to be pejorative . But it 's true . Then Grandmre came out in a blue feather-trimmed wrap , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmum , and was all , " Oh , good , Amelia , I 'm so glad you 're here . Meet Dr. Steve , " and I was like , " Whaty who ? " and she was all , " How dare you speak that way to my astrologist ? ? ? " So yeah . Grandmre has an astrologist . I will admit , I 'm pretty worried because , of course , I thought of Rasputin -- you know , that guy who was , like , " spiritual advisor " ( aka mysticoracle ) to the Russian royal family , before they all ended up getting shot by their angry populace . Not necessarily because of Rasputin , but the czar 's subjects did kind of lose respect for him because he and his wife were listening to the advice of a dude who collected hair from virgins as a hobby . Obviously , this did n't happen with Nancy Reagan , who was getting advice from astrologist Jeane Dixon , but that 's just because Jeane Dixon 's hobby was playing golf . Anyway , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't have a beard -- in fact , he barely had any hair at all , being mostly bald . And he was wearing a suit , not monk 's robes . Still , I did n't like it much when he pointed at me and went , " Do n't tell me ! Let me guess ! This is Her Royal Highness , Princess Amelia ! " Which made Grandmre clap her hands and do a jig , practically . " Yes ! " she cried . " You 're right ! He 's amazing ! Is n't he amazing , Amelia ? " I do n't see what 's so amazing about it , since he 'd heard Grandmre say my name when I walked in . Plus , it 's not like a picture of my face is n't plastered all over the cover of Teen People every month . But whatever . " Tell us what you 've learned about Amelia , Doctor , " Grandmre said , plopping herself down on one of the matching pink brocade chairs and snapping her fingers at me in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I gave him your birth date and time yesterday , Amelia , and Dr. Steve promised to read the results this afternoon , when you could be here to hear them . " " Um , that 's okay , " I said , as I headed for the bar . " I 'm good . I do n't need my fortune told . " Particularly by someone named Dr. Steve . " Dr. Steve does n't tell fortunes , Amelia , " Grandmre said , all scornfully . " He examines the positions of celestial bodies in the heavens at the time of someone 's birth , and interprets the meaning of that placement to come up with an educated prediction about the future course of events in the subject 's life . For instance , Dr. Steve believes I myself am currently in grave danger of incurring grievous bodily harm --  " " Assassination attempt ? " I asked hopefully , as I mixed her brandy and Cointreau . Maybe there was more to this Rasputin thing than I thought . But Grandmre just ignored me . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that correct , Dr. Steve ? " " I definitely see danger for you , Your Highness , " Dr. Steve said , looking gravely at my grandmother . " As well as a marriage proposal . " " I 'm quite positive it 's that odious Lord Crenshaw , " Grandmre said , as I handed her her drink . " He 's been quite persistent in asking to escort me to the charity ball the contessa is hosting for the American Heart Association on Valentine 's Day . Now , Dr. Steve . About Amelia --  " " I do n't want to know ! " I yelled . Because , seriously , who wants to know their future ? Not that I believe in astrology , but , you know , some of it is accurate . I mean , like the part about how Capricorns and Tauruses get along so well . Because how else can you explain why Michael Moscovitz , who is the most intelligent and gorgeous senior in the whole school ( well , unless you 're blind , like everyone who thinks Josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole school ) , would be going out with a lowly , flat-chested freshman like me ? It would be like if Josh Hartnett suddenly started dating Little Debbie , of snack cake fame . Mmmm , Little Debbies . But Dr. Steve had already pulled out my chart , and was saying things like , " Her Royal Highness , the princess Mia , is gifted with uncanny insight and takes great pleasure in nature and all living things --  " " Ah ! " I cried , trying to get away , only to trip over Rommel , who was cowering in his fur-lined basket by Grandmre 's magazine rack . " No ! Do n't tell me ! " " She is tremendously persistent , particularly with her affections --  " " Do n't say another word ! " I was trying to untangle myself from Rommel , but it was hard because he kept darting from one side of his basket to the other . It 's a very big basket . " And that 's why her longest-lasting partnership will be with a generous , caring Leo --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I screamed from the floor . " That 's not possible ! Michael is a Capricorn ! " " Well , obviously , Amelia , " Grandmre said , all primly , taking a sip of her Sidecar , " Michael is n't who you 're meant to end up with . What else , Dr. Steve ? " But I stopped listening after that . Because I knew then that Dr. Steve was a charlatan . Oh , he may not dress in monk 's robes or have a beard or collect the hair of virgins , but he 's no more a mystic oracle than Rasputin ever was . Continues ...
