Although many studies have looked at adjustment problems of foreign students , there is very little literature on African students studying specifically at a historically black institution . The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences and investigate the factors that cause adjustment problems for African students enrolled in the Spring 2004 semester at Delaware State University . Participants in this study included 57 of the 69 African students enrolled at Delaware State University that semester . The three methods employed in this study were questionnaire , focus groups , and observation . Contrary to some of the findings on similar studies , analysis for this study revealed that the African students did not have any problem with the English language and understanding instructors . <p> The international student population in the United States has increased dramatically over the years . Currently , even though many developed nations attract international students , the United States has the highest number of these students in the world ( Institute of International Education , 2001 ) . In the 2001-2002 school year , there were 547,867 international students studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 ) . Statistics indicated that in the 2001-2002 school year , there were 37,724 African students enrolled at institutions of higher learning in the United States , and this is depicted in Table 1 ( http : //opendoorsiienetwork ) . Studying in the United States poses challenges for many foreign students , such as the unfamiliarity with the English language and the American culture ( Selvadurai , 1998 ) . The fact , however , remains that students from other countries are important to colleges and universities because of the added cultural richness they bring to the institutions . Examples of some of the reasons people give for coming to the United States despite the adjustment problems they may face include seeking better job opportunities , joining family members already in the United States , furthering their education , and seeking political freedom ( Furnham &; Bochner , 1986 , p. 46 ) . <p> Several studies have looked at adjustment problems faced by international students ( Cheng , 1999 ; Ekaiko , 1981 ; Han , 1996 ; Lin &; Yi , 1997 ; Okafor , 1986 ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major adjustment problems of international students are living adjustment , which includes adjusting to American food , adapting to the climate , and financial and health concerns . Other problems include academic adjustment , such as lack of proficiency in the English language and lack of understanding of the American educational system ; socio-cultural adjustment , such as culture shock , racial discrimination , and conflicts between American host standards ( values and lifestyles ) and those of home country ; and psychological adjustment , which includes loneliness , depression , isolation , and loss of status and identity . <p> To increase one 's understanding of the experiences of African students in the United States , this descriptive study adopted a theoretical framework that focused on the socio-cultural aspects of these experiences . Purpose <p> This study 's purposes were to specifically look at the adjustment problems that African students face at Delaware State University , an 1891 Land-Grant institution , and how they coped with such problems ; the extent to which their problems were related to their length of stay ; how they perceived the programs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment ; and to describe their experiences in general at the university . Method <p> Data were collected using a survey questionnaire , two focus groups , and through observations . Participants for this study were 57 African students enrolled during Spring 2004 at Delaware State University . The instrument used in this study was a questionnaire ; focus groups and observations were also used to gather data . The first part of the 30-questionnaire consisted of 11 questions that requested geographic and background information on the participants . The second section contained a checklist of the students ' experiences and adjustment problems , and perception of Delaware State University . <p> All the participants were first contacted either in person or by phone about the form , purposes , and reason for of this study . Sixty-two of the surveys were hand-delivered by me to the participants . Five of the surveys , however , were mailed because the participants lived out of town and could not be contacted in person . Focus groups <p> Two sets of focus groups ( seven students in each group : three graduate students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information for this study . The 14 students were asked 12 questions ranging from their experiences to their adjustment problems at Delaware State University , and how they dealt with such problems . These questions solicited answers that illuminated the students ' experiences , the problems they face , how they cope with such problems , and their perceptions of Delaware State University . The students for these focus groups were selected through a systematic random process . The focus group sessions , which met for about one hour each , were taped , and participating students signed consent forms . The data were transcribed , and the text information was used alongside the analysis of the questionnaire responses . <p> The third method used for this study was observation . I kept a journal of the observations I made through conversations I had with the African students at Delaware State University . The conversations I had with them , even though they included other things , involved their experiences in general and how they were adjusting . After such conversations , I noted relevant information that helped me understood why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation piece of my study provided examples to substantiate the findings from my survey and focus groups . Treatment of Data <p> The data collected from the questionnaire were transferred to Systat 10 ( a statistical software program ) and then analyzed using statistical tests . Determination of significant relationship was set at ( alpha ) = .05 . Since the instrument yielded non-parametric data , it was appropriate to use simple statistical techniques . Thus , Chi-square tests were used to examine the relationship between respondents ' background characteristics and the degree of difficulty they faced . Descriptive statistics of percentages were used to analyze the adjustment problems . The focus group interviews were transcribed and analyzed . The journal entries , which were kept to understand some of the responses on the survey form , were also analyzed and discussed . Results <p> While the majority of respondents indicated that they did not face adjustment problems , it was clear that many of them had to deal with adjustment problems in various degrees . Of the 46.5% who experienced adjustment problems , 7% of the respondents had serious problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with factors in the areas of immigration limitations , feeling homesick , financing education , familiarity with U. S. customs , funding healthcare services , and experiencing racial and ethnic discrimination . Issues that were not problems for the majority of African students were understanding the English language , understanding instructors , making friends with Americans and other international students , getting acquainted with the U.S. system of education , and getting academic advisement . <p> Focus group discussions and journal entries support the claim that the students did not have problems with the English language because they came from countries where English is the official language . Focus group discussions and journal entries also support the claim that they faced discrimination because they were stereotyped as coming from low-life backgrounds and because of their accents . The students indicated that paying their tuition was a big burden on them and their families because , as students ( those who are on student visas ) , they were not allowed to work in the United States , and it was difficult for their relatives to pay for their education from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Responses from the focus group discussions revealed that African students coped with the adjustment problems they faced in two ways . First , they stated that they found themselves studying and working harder to overcome academic and social problems because they sometimes experienced subtle discrimination practices from some of their colleagues and some instructors . As one student puts it , " When I speak in class , some of the other students laugh at my accent . As a result , I just keep to myself , even though I may have something to say . " These experiences , they stated , are mainly stereotypical in nature , that is , some American students thought they were better off than the African students because of the images they saw on television , and others did not even like to be their roommates or work with them in groups for class projects . Second , the African students indicated that they also coped with the adjustment problems they faced by forming social support groups among other African students and other international students , who may be experiencing the same adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we want to just stay with other Africans , we feel more comfortable when we are with one another . " <p> Regarding the respondents ' length of stay and if that had an effect on their adjustment problems , 56% stated that the problems they faced had nothing to do with their length of stay , while 44% indicated that their length of stay had an effect on the problems that they faced . The problems many of them faced , they stated , they will continue to face because of things like their immigration status , their accents , and issues relating to the differences in the culture they grew up in . <p> The majority of the students indicated that the services offered by the International Students Office were inadequate for several reasons . Journal entries and focus group interviews revealed that the students were disappointed most when they had to vacate the school premises for short holidays , such as Thanksgiving and Easter when many of them did not have relatives in the state of Delaware or even in the United States for that matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university as a whole , should provide housing for them . The students also stated that they wanted to get a sense of belonging to the university . Although there is an international student body , they stated , for the most part they were left on their own . They want to see the International Students Office play a bigger role in their adjustment process , hold regular meetings with the foreign students and sponsor extracurricular activities . <p> An overwhelming majority of African students at Delaware State University responded that their experiences at the university were good . They attributed this to the high level of instruction and the fact that the student body and faculty and staff are diverse . Some of those who stated that they have not had good experiences cited problems with the administration over payment of tuition . Others cited discrimination and stereotyping from instructors , while some specifically stated that they were frustrated with the management of the Financial Aid Office . Discussion and implications of the study <p> The analysis of the data for this study collected from the questionnaire , focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adjustment problems of African students at Delaware State University . Many of the problems are common among foreign students in the United States . The recommendations from studies such as this one will not eliminate such problems , but they will limit or curb the degree to which many of these students experience these problems . This study , in many ways , supports the research models that were mentioned in the literature review section . <p> Although some of the findings are similar to many studies conducted on African students enrolled at U.S. college campuses , such as African students having problems with immigration , feeling homesick , and experiencing racial and ethnic discrimination , it does not reveal the same findings in the areas of problems with the English language , understanding instructors , and getting acquainted with the U.S. system of education . For example , Okafor 's 1986 study is similar to this one because it reveals that finding jobs due to immigration limitations and financing education were severe problems of African students at Michigan State University , which was also the case at Delaware State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that the first barrier that international students face is that of the English language , which was not the case for the African students at Delaware State University . <p> Also , I do not think that the fact that Delaware State University is a historically black institution had any discernable effect on the experiences and perceptions of the participants .
