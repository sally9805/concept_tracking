<p> THE new United States headquarters of Ikea , the Swedish home furnishings manufacturer and retailer , embraces the corporate philosophy that " home is the most important place in the world . " <p> The employees see that motto spelled out on some interior walls , and in the atmosphere that has been created in a three-story box of a building at the edge of a shopping area here , outside Philadelphia . It is cozy and casual , awash in natural light and bright colors . <p> " To create a better everyday life is a mission for the customers as well as for the co-workers , " said Lena Simonsson-Berge , a senior home furnishings specialist at Ikea , which is based in Almhult , Sweden . " You spend a lot of time there , so we want the office and the workplace to be as comfortable , friendly and beautiful as your home is . " <p> Furnished throughout with Ikea products  --  functional furniture , textiles and decorative accessories  --  it also reinforces the strong design culture of the company , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries worldwide , 29 of which are in the United States . The company plans to add 20 more stores a year over the next three years worldwide , including three to five in North America . <p> It was a democratic and nonhierarchical management structure that helped determine the office configuration in the headquarters building , which has 75,000 square feet of space . Few people in the company have titles , and no one , not even Pernille Spiers-Lopez , president of Ikea North America , has an enclosed office . <p> It is all an open plan , designed to encourage interaction , according to Nick O'Donnell , Ikea 's project director for the new building . The previous headquarters space had 65,00 square feet and was located nearby , in Plymouth Meeting , where Ikea opened its first store in the United States in 1985 . <p> " We encourage people to move around and interact , " Mr. O'Donnell said . " Walls segregate people and keep them apart . " <p> Wireless Internet capability means that staff members can meet or work wherever they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of them on flexible time schedules , and is open 24 hours a day . There are casual seating areas placed strategically on all floors , as well as an outdoor area to bring people together socially or for impromptu meetings . <p> The most significant of these casual areas is the three-story sky-lit atrium and staircase at the center of the building . Lengths of bright patterned fabric flutter over a 40-foot-high installation of one of Ikea 's most popular shelving units , named Billy . <p> The red upholstered seats at the base of the stairs are often occupied as spontaneous meetings spring up throughout the workday . Opposite the main entrance , the atrium area is intended to send a message of dynamism and collegiality to staff members at the home office as well as to visiting co-workers , job applicants and outside visitors . <p> " The challenge was to make a good impression the first time as well as over time for the co-workers who come back every day , " Ms. Simonsson-Berge said . <p> Teamwork is important at Ikea , and numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those rooms are named for various countries where Ikea has stores . In addition , there are 14 " huddle rooms , " 10-foot by 10-foot cubes painted in primary colors and designed for small groups . The bright colors can be harsh , but that 's part of the plan , Mr. O'Donnell said . Meetings in them tend to be brief . <p> The biggest and brightest common area is the second-floor " great room , " named for and styled after the room in a conventional suburban-style house that combines the kitchen , dining area and living room . Serving as cafeteria , functioning kitchen and break area , it provides a homelike setting as a showcase for Ikea kitchen cabinets , furniture , textiles , table accessories and cooking utensils . The look and colors will change every year , as the product range changes , Ms. Simonsson-Berge said . Right now it has a country feel in red , white , blue and black . <p> Flexibility was likewise built into the work areas . Desks can be moved and reconfigured along with their electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being buried in the floor . This also makes is easier to add desks ; the staff is expected to grow by 100 people over the next 18 months , Mr. O'Donnell said . <p> The bright primary colors and decorative fabric panels stand out in the interior against a backdrop of gray linoleum flooring , concrete and steel stairs , ceiling grids that barely conceal the cables and ventilation equipment and office furnishings in a neutral birch veneer that is typical of Scandinavian furniture . ( Birch trees are common in the Swedish landscape and have been planted all around the Conshohocken building . ) <p> The bright colors , part of Ikea 's signature look , are among many elements in the office design that Ms. Simonsson-Berge said were conceived in Sweden to combat the dreariness of its long winter days that may have barely four hours of light . Large windows are also emphasized , to bring in as much light as possible , even when the views are of parking lots , industrial buildings and a junkyard , as they are at Ikea in Conshohocken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home decoration and color has a lot to do with brightening up the darkness , " Ms. Simonsson-Berg said . " We have to make the best of the situation . " <p> The approach to energy conservation was typically Swedish , too . Much of the structural steel was recycled , the flooring is a natural product made from linseed oil and the birch wood that went into the furniture is from a sustainable forest , according to Mr. O'Donnell . A majority of the lighting in the building operates on either motion sensors or light sensors that turn lights on and off according to the levels of natural light coming into the offices at any given time . The parking spaces closest to the entrance are reserved for fuel-efficient vehicles like hybrid cars . According to Ms. Simonsson-Berge , an anti-frills penchant kept embellishments to a minimum in everything from the boxlike design of the structure to the plain , white , company-issued coffee mugs on desks . <p> " Swedishness is about being resourceful and simple and we do n't have too much stuff , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't exaggerate when it comes to the size of a product and the materials used are just enough , never an overload .
