Enchantress By Jackson , Lisa Pocket Star Jackson , Lisa Castle Abergwynn , North Wales May 1286 As God is my witness , I 'll not stop until I find my boy ! " Garrick , son of Maginnis and baron of all of Abergwynn , slid from his mud-splattered mount , his boots sinking into the wet earth of the inner bailey . His clothes were grimy , his hair unruly , his beard in need of cutting - evidence of days of riding and searching and finding nothing . Nothing ! Not one bloody trace of the boy or the nurse . A scowl as dark as the thunderclouds gathering over the north tower creased his face , his harsh features ruthless and set . Tossing wet hair from his eyes , he swore a silent oath at the fates , or God , he did n't care which . His knights , brave souls who had ridden with him on his luckless quest , dismounted , avoiding him , leading their horses to the stable . Loyal men , they knew when to leave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blackest humor ever to have darkened his soul . Only George , an ungainly boy of barely fourteen summers , whose skin was pockmarked and reddened , dared speak , and this was only because , as Garrick 's vassal , he had no choice . " I will see to your steed , my lord , " he squeaked out , snatching the rain-swollen reins from Garrick 's gloved hand . Barely hearing the boy , Garrick strode forward , shoulders hunched against the wind , but head unbowed . He would not be broken . He would not fail . As long as there was some trace of breath in his body , he would search for his son . For the first time in his life he did n't care about his destrier , his castle , or his lands . All that mattered was Logan . With a rattle of heavy chains , the portcullis clanged down , sealing off the castle , as if anything worth protecting remained inside . Garrick snorted at his own vanity . How prideful he 'd been . How he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive towers , the curtain wall wide and long enough to stand his entire army . God 's teeth , what a fool he 'd been , thinking this castle , this miserable fortress , was so valuable ! Glaring up at the slate-dark heavens , he muttered a curse to a God who had not only taken his wife away from him three years ago but had now stolen his boy as well . As if in answer , lightning streaked the sky , a jagged sizzle that flashed white against the square northern tower . Thunder clapped mockingly over the land , as if God himself were laughing . Garrick threw back his head , and rain drizzled down his neck and face , leaving cold droplets to run beneath his shirt . " I 'll find him . By all that is holy and that which is not , I 'll find my boy or die trying ! " Again thunder cracked . Angrily Garrick stalked through the mud to the great hall at the far corner of the inner bailey . Castle Abergwynn was perched high on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer cliffs that fell a hundred feet to treacherous rocks and raging surf . Yet even the thick stone barricades had n't been protection enough to save his son from harm . Walking briskly through the forebuilding he did n't bother pausing at the chapel . Let Friar Francis stew in his own sanctimonious juices . Though Garrick heard the chaplain murmuring prayers , he was n't in the mood to face a man of God , and he 'd prayed enough as it was . What good had it done ? Had God seen fit to lead him to his son ? No ! His boots rang sharply against the stone steps as he climbed toward the great hall , his pride , his home , and now not much more than an empty , dark chamber with no laughter , no warmth , no quick little footsteps . He strode to the hearth and warmed his hands , though the coldness would never leave his heart . Servants , accustomed to his black moods , made themselves scarce , finding work elsewhere . Smoke from the hearth curled lazily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a layer of soot on the stone walls . The dogs that had been with Garrick , as if sensing their master 's mood , slunk into the shadows , growling over a bone or scrap of meat that had fallen into the rushes . Garrick shouted at the hounds until they lay quietly in the corner , their ever-vigilant eyes turned toward him . It had been ten days since he 'd last seen Logan , his son , and although Garrick was lord of the manor , baron of Abergwynn , he was frightened that he would never lay eyes upon his boy again . Curse and rot the souls of those who would steal his child ! Blood would surely be spilled if any harm came to Logan . Scurrying footsteps stirred the rushes covering the floor . Garrick did n't bother looking up . " You 're back , m'lord ! " the plump woman servant , Cailin , exclaimed . " Did you find ... " But her voice trailed off when she noticed his grim expression . Quickly she crossed her ample bosom before disappearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ware 's voice echoed off the heavy timbers supporting the high ceiling . Garrick 's head snapped up , and he narrowed his eyes against the smoke from the fire as his younger brother , his shoulders square , his blue eyes bright , his chin thrust forward defiantly , climbed down the curved staircase toward the great hall . A good-looking lad , Ware would soon be a man . His chest was thick , his pride great , though he had not yet seen his first battle . " There 's been no word ? " Garrick growled , knowing the answer before the question passed his lips . " No . " Ware stood before him , his arrogance visible in the angle of his head . " No ransom demands ? " " None . " Garrick 's jaw hardened , and his eyes turned flinty gray . " The knights who guarded Logan . Have they told you nothing else ? " " Nothing , Garrick . " Ware 's eyes slid away from the power of his older brother 's gaze , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrick 's mouth twisted downward . The boy had no stomach for lashings , and in truth , neither did Garrick . Yet sometimes he had no choice but to beat the truth from those whose loyalty was in doubt . " Did Strahan use every means of making them remember ? " Ware grimaced , as if he were holding on to the contents of his stomach at the memory . " Aye , " he whispered , his teeth clenched . " When it was over , they pledged their fealty yet again . They are loyal men , Garrick . You did them an injustice . ' T is not their fault that Logan wandered off , perhaps over the cliffs - " A massive hand clenched over the front of Ware 's tunic , and Garrick yanked hard , lifting his brother off his feet and forcing Ware to meet his gaze . " I blame no one but myself , " he muttered , " but I must know that my men were not a part of this treasonous plot to capture my son . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin and met Garrick 's gray eyes rebelliously . " Perhaps it was not treason . Mayhap the child ambled off , his nursemaid after him , and they both lost themselves in the forest . They could have drowned in the river or fallen from the cliffs into the sea - " " Nay ! " Garrick snarled , shaking his brother yet again . " No bodies have been found . I will not believe Logan to be dead . The boy did not wander off . " He dropped Ware to his feet and turned back to the fire , hoping the red-gold flames would stave off the cold that had seeped into his soul . " There is still much unrest here . Though Edward is king , there are those who would see him dead and spit on his grave . Since they can not reach him , they test the very spirit of all those who are loyal to Longshanks . ' T is not many winters since Llywelyn was killed , less time since the rebellion failed . " Garrick rubbed his chin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . It still simmers in the hearts of Welshmen . " His nostrils flared in anger . " Aye , " he muttered , " and those who were loyal to Llywelyn will stop at nothing to rid themselves of Edward . They would take the life of a child for their cause . " " So you think the culprits be Welshmen ? " Wearily Garrick shook his head and clenched his fists as if closing his hands around the throat of one of Logan 's abductors . " If only I knew . " Ware glanced at the fire . " What of the guards who were to watch Logan ? " " Banish them . " " But - " " Banish them , I say ! " Garrick ordered savagely . " Let them know they are lucky to leave with their lives ! " " You 're making a mistake . " The insolent pup . Garrick glowered at his younger brother . " I am baron of this castle . I shall do as I please . " " Yes , m'lord , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the castle creaked open and footsteps rang on the stairs to the great hall . Garrick was in no mood for idle conversation . Strahan of Hazelwood , Garrick 's cousin and most trusted knight , entered . Tall and broad-shouldered , with a nose that hooked and eyes as brown as the robes of an almsman , Strahan bore little resemblance to his cousins . One look at Garrick and he frowned . " You did not find Logan . " Beneath his wet tunic , Garrick 's shoulders bunched . " No . " " Perhaps now you will consider my suggestion . " Garrick scowled darkly and ground his back teeth together . " You are speaking of the witch . " " She is not a witch but a sorceress - one who talks to the wind , " Strahan explained . " Then she is daft . " " She has found others who were lost , " Strahan argued . " Logan 's trail is no longer fresh . Even the dogs know not where to look . " Garrick could n't argue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an angry glare at the dogs lying restlessly in the shadows . Strahan spoke the truth . Logan and his nursemaid , Jocelyn , had been missing too long already . Each day that passed increased the chances that Garrick would never see his son again . " Have you any other plan ? " Strahan pressed . Garrick shoved his wet hair from his face , leaving a streak of mud on his forehead . " I have sent spies to Castle Pennick and Castle Hawarth , whose barons once allied themselves with the rebellion . My men will mingle with the peasants and servants and learn what they can . " His nostrils flared . " If the barons have done my son harm , " he pledged , his deep voice ringing to the crossbeams overhead , " they will pay with their lives . " " What if your men find nothing ? " Strahan asked . Garrick felt cornered , but he had no choice . As Strahan had pointed out , he would be soon out of options . " If Calvert and Trent return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The thought of a sorceress - a woman with a talent for magic and the black arts - bothered him . Though he was not deeply religious , he did not like going against God . Noticing Cailin sweeping the rushes , he growled at her to bring him a cup of ale . When her eyebrows sprang upward in surprise , he barked still louder , and soon she returned with a silver cup for each of the men near the fire . Garrick drained his in a single swallow . He considered what the chaplain might say if he did indeed go forth in quest of a witch , then decided he did n't really give a bloody damn what the good man thought . Leave Friar Francis to his useless prayers . It was time for swords . Calvert returned at nightfall . His face was white , and his shoulders slumped as he approached Lord Garrick , who was seated at the trestle table in the great hall . Kneeling before his baron , Calvert said , " I have failed , my lord . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trace of Master Logan at Castle Pennick . " Calvert , a short man with a bulbous nose and red eyebrows , struggled to his feet . " You questioned all the servants ? " Garrick asked , his spirits sinking ever deeper . " Aye , and some of the soldiers whose tongues were loosened with ale . " " Know they nothing ? " Calvert shook his head . " If the boy is at Pennick , he is hidden deep and the secret is kept only by the baron and his most trusted knights . " Garrick turned this over in his mind . He had often met the lord of Pennick Keep , Nelson Rowley . " I think not . Rowley is known to brag . Had he my son , his entire castle would know it , " he surmised . " Aye , and Rowley would have made the fact known to me as well . " Garrick 's eyes focused again on his knight . " You have done well , Calvert . You may take your leave . " Ignoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced from Strahan to Ware . " We will wait for Trent and see what says he about Castle Hawarth . " Strahan nodded , his dark eyes glinting a bit . " A wise decision . " Ware did n't agree , and his gaze challenged that of his older brother , but he held his tongue and bit off a healthy chunk of meat . The next morning as Garrick was walking to the stables , the sentinel 's voice rang through the yard . " Sir Trent approaches ! " Garrick braced himself . With dread thundering through his brain , he ran to the outer bailey . Trent 's lathered stallion galloped into the yard , the man astride huddled far over the neck of his steed . Garrick reached the war-horse as the mighty beast slid to a stop and Trent , reins and bits of mane clutched in his fingers , toppled onto the ground . " See to the horse , " Garrick commanded the stableboy as he knelt down and gathered Sir Trent into his arms . Blood stained the knight 's shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He - he is not - " " Quiet ! " Garrick said . He glanced up at Roger , a young page who had run from the great hall . " Summon the priest ! " he ordered the boy , fearing that Trent 's end was near and he should receive last rites . Garrick lifted the young knight and carried him toward the castle as George , wide-eyed , led Trent 's horse toward the stables . Trent groaned in Garrick 's arms , his body convulsing in pain . " Hold steady , " Garrick said gently , though he felt the life draining out of his young charge . He 'd been foolish to send one man on so dangerous a mission . " Master Logan is not at Castle Hawarth - nor is the maid Jocelyn . " Trent swallowed with difficulty . His breath rasped and rattled in his lungs . " Get him some water and have a bed made ready , " Garrick ordered Cailin as he carried Trent through the hallway . " Shh , man , hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , my lord , " Cailin whispered gravely . " Until Lady Clare returns ... " Desperate , Trent grasped Garrick 's shirt and whispered in a breath-starved voice , " I was caught by Lord McBrayne . " " Hush , Trent . ' T is time to save your strength - " " Nay , my lord , listen , " Trent cried , his face twisted in agony , his bloodless lips sucking in air . " I was with a wench in the House of McBrayne . She knew naught of a captured boy . " " Osric McBrayne found you - lying with a wench ? " Garrick asked as a white-faced page scurried forward , offering a cup of water . " Aye , " Trent admitted , his eyes glazing . Garrick scowled as the page forced the cup to Trent 's lips . Water drizzled down the knight 's dirty , beard-darkened chin . " We will talk more when you are stronger . " " Nay ! Now ! " Trent insisted , slapping the cup anxiously away as his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , too - soldiers with loose tongues , craftsmen ... freemen , and peasants . " He struggled , words coming hard to his cracked lips . " None knew of the boy ... none . " " And still McBrayne did this to you ? " Garrick whispered , rage tearing through his soul . " Aye ... He said he would have no spies from the House of Maginnis in ... Continues ...
