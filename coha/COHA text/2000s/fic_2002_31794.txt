Chapter One " When you call me that , smile ! " Owen Wister He was on the east side of the Absaroka Range , in the timber , heading down toward the Popo Agie . He was in no hurry , and there was no real reason for him to go there . He just had him a hankering , call it . He felt he might run into some old friends around there who , like the lone rider , had felt the calling for companionship . He had n't been down there in some time , not since the last rendezvous back in ' 30 , he thought it was . He was pretty sure it was the year of our Lord 1837 . Had to be close to that , anyway . If the year was as he figured , he was about thirty-five years old , near as he could figure . And he 'd never felt better in his life . The rider was of average height for his time , lean-hipped and rawhide tough , with tremendous power in his upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last seventeen or eighteen or so years in the mountains considered him handsome . He tried to recall the last time he 'd seen a white woman . Two , three years at least . Just thinking about the rendezvous got him all lost in memories-but not so lost that he forgot where he was and to keep a sharp eye out for Injuns . He rode with his Hawken rifle across the saddle horn and had another one shovedinto a saddle boot . He carried two .50 caliber pistols behind his waist sash and two more hung in leather on the saddle horn , one on each side . He 'd always boasted that he was a peaceful man , but Injuns is notional folks . You never really know how to take them . A man can nearabout always ride into an Injun camp and they 'll feed you and bed you down for the night . They 'll usually treat a body right well . ' Course , depending on the tribe and the general mood of the day , the rub comes when you try to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun and skin you alive . He had seen what was left of a man after that . It was a disheartening sight , to say the least . He did n't expect the other feller cared much for it either . The lone rider rode easy , ruminating on this and that . He 'd seen a white man up the trail about five months back , when the snow was thick , and he 'd told him it was Christmas . That had got him to feeling all maudlin and the like , thinking about folks and family he had n't seen in years and would probably never see again on this side of the grave . Time gets confusing up in the High Lonesome . The months and years just blend together and do n't take on a whole hell of a lot of importance . He reined up at a creek and swung down from the saddle , getting the kinks out of his muscles and bones and giving his horses a chance to drink and blow . He rode a mountain horse he 'd caught and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammer was a gray , tough as a mountain goat and stood eighteen hands high . His good pack horse was also a gray , just as tough as Hammer and just as smart : he would n't tote no more than he felt he could comfortably carry . Overload him and he just would n't move . Stand there and look at you with them eyes telling you to get that crap off his back . Smart . The rider looked all around him careful , then stood still and sniffed the air . He could detect nothing in the cool mountain air except the scent of nature 's own growth in springtime . There was no Injun smell . After so many years in the mountains , he had learned that all men have a distinctive scent that can be picked up by others if you just teach your blower to do it . He stretched out on his belly by the creek and took him a long drink of cold clean water . He thought about taking off his moccasins and sticking his bare feet in the crick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some poor critter downstream that was n't hurtin ' nobody and who just come out of the woods for a cool drink would be sick for a week . He did take off his moccasins and rub his feet , though . Felt good . He rubbed his feet dry on the grass and slipped back into his moccasins . He chewed on a piece of jerky and wished long for some coffee , but he 'd been out of coffee for weeks . That was another reason for this trip . He had to resupply with salt and beans and coffee and the like . He also had to get him a new pair of longhandle underwear . His was plumb wore out . And his buckskins were thin . He was known from the Northwest to the deserts of the Southwest as Preacher . He was far from being a man of the cloth-about as far as a man could get , even though he 'd been raised in the church as a boy . When he was new and green to the High Lonesome , Injuns had grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well he stood pain . If he stood it well , they would praise him and sing songs about him . ' Course , those songs would be sort of hard to appreciate from the grave . So he started preaching . He preached all day and all night . The Injuns finally figured he was crazy as a lizard and turned him loose . The nickname stuck . Preacher had been in the mountains since he was just a boy ; he had run away from a good home and reached the mountains a year later . And while he had left the mountains many times to see what was over the next ridge or river , he always returned to the High Lonesome . He had lived with a number of tribes , and gotten along with many of them . He 'd had him a squaw from time to time , and a few offspring . But unlike many of his counterparts , Preacher could see the writing on the wall , so to speak , even though he might have some difficulty reading actual words . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living anymore , and it was only going to get worse . He knew that while most of the other mountain men did not , or would not accept it . Preacher could do a lot of things besides trapping . He could pan for gold , he could scout for the Army or for wagon trains , he even knew a little about farming-although he kept that to himself . He cut his eyes to Hammer as the horse raised his head and pricked his ears up . He was over to him in a heartbeat , stroking his neck and talking to him low , so he would n't whinny and give away their position . He spoke to the pack horse and rubbed his neck . They stood quiet , but they were n't liking what they smelled one damn bit . Then Preacher smelled what the horses had smelled , and he heard them coming . Injuns , and their scent was strong . With it came the scent of blood . Fresh blood . He picketed both horses on graze and pulled the pistols from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rise and peeked through the brush . What he saw below did n't set well at all . Five young bucks and they had prisoners . The Injuns looked to be Arapaho , and Preacher never had got on too well with that tribe . They just did n't much like the white man . Preacher lay still , moving only his eyes , carefully checking everything out . But it appeared five was all there was . But five bucks on the warpath was plenty . He could see fresh scalps on the manes of their horses and on their war lances . And they were n't Injun scalps . The bucks had two white women and two white men , and from the looks on their faces , they were all plenty scared . And they had a right to be . A lot of wagon trains were pushing west , to Oregon or California . Wagons had been rolling to Oregon for several years . Nat Wyeth , Preacher thought it was , took the first emigrants over the Oregon Trail back in ' 31 or ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot of them had n't made it . Preacher had him a thought that those poor , scared pilgrims was part , or had been part , of a small wagon train that just ran out of luck . " The Lord will see us through , brother and sisters , " a man said . " Put your faith in the Lord . " Missionaries , Preacher thought . Come to the wilderness to bring Jesus to the savages . Damn fools bringing womenfolk out here to preach with them . Injuns do n't think like white people . It 's not that the whites is right and the Injuns is wrong , it 's just that they 're two very different ways of life . Whites and Injuns do n't think alike . Injuns do n't steal ' cause they 're bad people . It 's more of a game to them , and right and wrong does n't enter into it . Courage and dying well and bravery mean a great deal to Injuns . They ca n't none of them abide a coward . Preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't need or want their religion ; they had a religion all their own and the practiced it and lived by it . But you 'd have better luck trying to tell a lawyer to shut up than you would with a Bible-thumper . Preacher watched as one young buck pulled at himself and grinned at the others . He knew then that one of the young women-and they were both lookers-was fixin ' to get hopped on right then and there in front of God and everybody else . Then the buck said as much . Preacher spoke some Arapaho , and heard him tell the woman what he was gon na do . She looked up at him from the log where they 'd plopped her , confusion and fear on her face . Then that buck just reached down and run his hand up under her dress . That woman squalled something fierce . " Here now ! " a man blustered up . " You stop that barbaric behavior , you hear me ? " The woman 's hands was tied behind her back , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his legs and he went down howling and puking , both hands holding onto his privates . Preacher winced and he was thirty feet away . Preacher knew if he was to do anything , it had to be now . He eased the hammers back on his old .50 caliber pistols and laid them on the ground . He took the second brace-hoping the powder was dry on them all-and eased the hammers back on them . Another buck jerked out a knife and whacked an ear off one of the men prisoners . The man screamed and the blood poured . The buck then proceeded to make it clear to the lady-using sign language that an idiot could understand-that if she did n't hike up her skirts and do it real quick , he was gon na cut something else off the man , and it was located a mite lower than his remaining ear . " Melody ! " the man with one ear hollered . Preacher figured he got the message , too . The buck she 'd kicked in the privates was still on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place . She had really put her little foot in him . There was n't any other option left Preacher . He lifted his pistols with the double-set triggers and let ' em bang . He had double-shotted these and the first ball hit the buck with the knife in the chest ; the second ball hit him in the belly . Both balls from the second pistol hit a brave smack in the face . He was a real mess when he hit the ground . Preacher grabbed the second brace of pistols and let the lead fly . He could n't hardly see a thing for the gun smoke but knew he had put four Injuns on the ground and the other one was just getting to his moccasins , still bent over in pain . Preacher jerked his long-bladed knife from its sheath and ran down the short slope toward the scared pilgrims . He ran right over that skinny Injun with the bruised privates and knocked him sprawling back to the ground . He jumped up , a war axe in his hand , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language what he thought of him , his family , and his horse . The buck screamed and charged . Preacher ducked and cut him from brisket to backbone . That blade was honed to a fine edge and went in easy . The skinny Injun was out of it . Preacher ran back to his guns and loaded up again as fast as he could . The women were in a shocked silence . The man with one ear looked at Preacher like he was some sort of devil . And , Preacher thought , maybe he did look like one . He had n't shaved in a month or so and his clothes were made from what he could kill and skin and cure . His hat was so old and floppy it had no shape . Preacher reckoned he did look like a wild man to these city folks . " Praise be ! " Melody found her voice . " The Lord has sent us a warrior ! " " He ai n't done no such of a thing , " Preacher told her , while cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close by . Now get them others untied and let 's get the hell gone from here ' fore more Injuns show up . " The second man put his mouth in motion and stuck his two pennies worth in . " We 're all Christians , brother . And we do n't hold with strong language in front of ladies . " Preacher spat on the ground . " That 's your damn problem . I do n't hold with fools comin ' into the mountains and stirrin ' up the Injuns . So I reckon that makes us even . " Preacher cut the others loose . He helped Melody to her feet and she swayed against him for a moment . She was all woman , that one . And when their eyes met , Preacher could see that she knew he was all man . A high flush came to her cheeks and her smile was tight and her eyes bright , like with a fever . They had a fever all right , but it was n't brought on by sickness . Preacher released her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking , and Jehovah did n't have a damn thing to do with it . " You do n't have to worry about the other savages , " the man with one ear and bloody face said . Preacher knew then he was dealing with a real pilgrim . In the mountains , a man always worries about Injuns . Preacher grunted in reply . " You see , " one-ear said , pulling a fancy handkerchief out of a jacket pocket and pressing it to the side of his head . " The other savages fled in a different direction after the attack . " " They did n't flee nowheres , " Preacher told him . " They own these mountains ; they got no reason to be afraid . All they did was split up to divvy up the booty . But how do you know they did n't plan on meetin ' up agin , right here ? " That shut one-ear right up . " We must get Richard to a doctor , " the haughty-acting fellow said . Preacher laughed at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from here . Wo n't take us more'n a month to get there . What we 'll do is get gone from here and then I 'll take a look at your partner 's head . Clean it out good . I 'd pour whiskey on it but I ai n't got none . " " You probably drank it all , lurching about in some drunken debauchery , " the second female spoke up . She had her color up and was climbing up on her soapbox . " Cavorting about with a loose woman , more than likely a pure , simple , ignorant savage you took advantage of . " " Amen , " the mouthy man said . " It 's not only the savages to whom we must introduce God . " Preacher chuckled and shook his head . " For shore I drank the whiskey . As to the second part , no . Let 's go . When we make camp I 'll fix up a poultice for one-ear there . You ai n't hurt bad , mister . But you 're gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your head for the rest of your life . Now , all of you , move , goddammit ! " Chapter Two They were in trouble and Preacher knew that for a hard fact . The Arapaho bucks back yonder had been wearing read streaks on their faces . To an Arapaho , the color red could mean three things : earth , man , or blood . In this case , Preacher pretty well knew it meant blood , and they were n't in the best of positions , either . They were caught with the Shoshoni just to the west of them , the Blackfoot to the north , the Crow to the east , and the Arapaho and the Cheyenne to the south and everywhere in the immediate surroundings . All in all , it was not a good place to be . Preacher , traveling alone , never gave it much worrying time . He knew how to stay alive in hostile country . But with four pilgrims-that was quite another matter . And two of them females , no less . That only added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Preacher told them . " We do n't have the proper saddles for the ladies , " the mouthy man said . " And by the way , my name is Edmond . You know Melody and Richard . This is Penelope . " " Well , I am just thrilled beyond words . Now , get up on them damn horses ! " Nobody moved . With a snort of disgust , Preacher climbed up the gently sloping bank , slid down the other side , and fetched his own animals , leading them around to the others . They still had n't made a move toward the ponies . He swung into the saddle and led an Indian pony over to the group . He looked at Melody . " Mount up , sister . I 'll get you outta here . Move , woman ! " Melody did n't hesitate . She stepped up on a log , hiked up her skirts , and swung onto the horse 's back . Preacher handed her the reins . " Let 's go . " " What about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , woman ! " Preacher said . " You 'd but a hog-caller to shame . If you wan na come with us , put your butt on that pony 's back and come on .
