The Hangover Bradley Cooper , Ed Helms , Zach Galifianakis , Justin Bartha R 3 stars SUMMER 'S SURPRISE HIT ? COMEDY Ever wonder what McLovin '  - -  Superbad 's teen nerd gone wild -- grew up to be ? Probably somebody like Stu ( Helms , of TV 's The Office ) : an uptight dentist turned drunken stud who 's one of two wonderfully wacky standout characters in The Hangover , a raunchy comic joyride of a movie . Stu 's equal in earning laughs here is man-child Alan ( Galifianakis ) , a bearded Baby Huey with a demonic gleam in his eye . A slam dunk to be this summer 's Wedding Crashers , Hangover follows this ill-matched duo -- along with teacher Phil ( Cooper ) and groom-to-be Doug ( Bartha )  - -  when they head to Las Vegas from Los Angeles for a one-night bachelor bash . It turns into a drunken bacchanal during which the groom goes missing . Will Doug 's hungover pals find him in time ? And what are both a baby and a tiger doing in the quartet 's hotel suite ? Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slaphappy fun . That 's in big part due to Helms and Galifianakis , who have dramatically opposing comedy styles . Helms sputters and spins like an overwound mechanical toy , while Galifianakis slides in a laugh line with impish stealth . Away We Go John Krasinski , Maya Rudolph R 3 stars CRITIC 'S CHOICE COMEDY Burt ( Krasinski ) and Verona ( Rudolph )  - -  in their 30s but still barely settled -- are expecting a baby . Hoping to find the perfect place to call home before starting diaper duty , the two embark on a city-hopping journey to visit family and friends ( the film brims with sensational cameos , including those by Allison Janney , Catherine O'Hara and Jeff Daniels ) in a terrific comic drama . As deftly directed by Sam Mendes ( Revolutionary Road ) , Away We Go is often as breezy as its title , bursting with manic energy . But as the couple discover they must map out their own path and not model themselves on others , it can be poignant and even heartbreaking . Krasinski and , especially , Rudolph give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough that you could easily bump into them at the supermarket . Land of the Lost Will Ferrell , Danny McBride , Anna Friel PG-13 1 stars COMEDY Ferrell ( left ) , departing from his usual habits , resists getting naked in this overblown special-effects comedy -- though he does scamper about in shorts and , later , his undies . But that 's not the scary part . That part would be the rampaging dinosaurs which chase after scientist Rick Marshall ( Ferrell ) and his time-traveling buddies after they end up in a land where , as Marshall puts it , " the past , present and future are all mashed up . " Mashed up perfectly describes Lost , which ca n't decide if it 's a wild and crazy comedy , a laid-back spoof or a full-on Jurassic Park Jr . There are funny lines and bits , but mostly this is a long slog . BOX VIVA THESE VEGAS MOVIES ! VIVA LAS VEGAS ( 1964 ) If you see only one Elvis Presley flick , make it this winner ( with Ann-Margret ) . OCEAN 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pals rob a casino , it 's Rat Pack redux deluxe . THE COOLER ( 2003 ) In a beguiling romantic drama worth rediscovering , a habitual loser ( William H. Macy , right ) turns lucky . BOX FROM SNL STAR TO LEADING LADY MAYA RUDOLPH * The funny actress , 36 , shines as a mom-to-be in Away We Go . HOW WAS THE TRANSITION FROM SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE ? It was painless ! I 'm a real human being and not just some crazy old lady who drinks booze all day and wears huge wigs . It 's nice to emote in a way that uses another part of yourself . YOU 'RE EXPECTING YOUR SECOND CHILD WITH DIRECTOR PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON . HOW WAS PLAYING A FIRST-TIME MOM ? It was neat for me to go backwards a bit and remember what my life was like before I had a baby . As a mom you forget that easygoing lackadaisical time . It 's a lovely window of selfishness . BOX NOW PLAYING MY LIFE IN RUINS My Big Fat Greek Wedding 's Nia Vardalos ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide in Greece who gets her groove back in a cloying romantic comedy . The on-location scenery is spectacular , though , making this a cheap virtual vacation -- minus the jet lag . ( PG-13 ) 2 stars DEPARTURES Winner of the Oscar for best foreign language film , this lovely Japanese drama tells with delicacy and humor how an unemployed cellist ( handsome Masahiro Motoki , right , the Brad Pitt of Japan ) finds his calling after taking a job handling the ceremonial preparation of corpses for cremation .
