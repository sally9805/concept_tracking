In 1933 Warner Bros. made perky musicals designed to snap Americans out of their depression . In Canada , as filmmaker Guy Maddin imagines it , a rich woman dreamed of exploiting , not exorcising , the world 's misery . Lady Port-Huntly ( Isabella Rossellini ) , a scheming beer baroness whose two glass legs are filled with her own brew , concocts a song contest with a $25,000 prize for the saddest music in the world . In return , milady will have the ideal promo for the end of Prohibition in the U.S. As she promises , " If you 're sad and like beer , I 'm your lady . " <P> Cinephiles know the Winnipeg-based Maddin ( Tales from the Gimli Hospital , Twilight of the Ice Nymphs ) as a unique , independent spirit who makes modern movies with exquisitely anachronistic techniques : fake degraded stock , blue and yellow tints , declamatory acting styles and lighting so soft-focus , Garbo could have bathed in it . The Saddest Music in the World , based on a script by Kazuo Ishiguro ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maddin 's first superproduction . It boasts a $2.5 million budget and a few actors you may have heard of : Rossellini , Euro-Kewpie Maria de Medeiros and Mark McKinney from The Kids in the Hall . <P> The approach , though , is as weird as ever . From the talking tapeworm at the beginning to the Eskimo production number at the end , Saddest Music is the most enthralling 1933 musical made in 2003 . In a movie age when there 's hardly a garde , let alone an avant-garde , Maddin proves there are many languages to cinema , including the dead one of antique film . And in that language , he sings , he soars .  --  By Richard Corliss
