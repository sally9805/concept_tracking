<p> HIDALGO - As the Christmas season jams Texas border bridges with holiday travelers , federal inspectors are seeing an upswing in child smuggling . <p> And though some of the children are destined for black-market adoptions , most smuggling along the Southwest border is orchestrated by undocumented adults living and working in the United States who are desperate to bring their children in , especially during the holidays . <p> You have a tremendous movement of people going south to visit family in Mexico " during the holiday season , explained Rick Pauza , a Customs and Border Protection spokesman in Laredo . So around the holidays , and afterward , there is an increased incidence of children brought through the ports of entry in an attempt to reunite with family members on the U.S. side . " <p> Federal officials are concerned because some parents hand their children over to unscrupulous smugglers who often hold them hostage while demanding additional smuggling fees . And in Arizona , border officials have seen a disturbing trend of children being drugged by smugglers so inspectors at border stations can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the number of attempted child smugglings along the Southwest border this year was not available , but officials at some crossings say they have seen an increase associated with the holidays . <p> During two consecutive weekends in late November , inspectors at the Hidalgo Bridge near McAllen intercepted nine children traveling with people falsely claiming to be their parents or grandparents , said David Moreno , chief of immigration for Customs and Border Protection at Hidalgo . <p> Some carry fake documents <p> A shocking case was the Nov. 14 arrest at the Hidalgo bridge of a Donna couple charged with trying to smuggle a baby girl born only 10 hours before to a Mexican woman in Reynosa , a bordertown across the Rio Grande . <p> Immigration agents became suspicious when the couple could not produce a birth certificate for the girl , whom they claimed was born 10 days before in a McAllen hospital . The couple was charged with smuggling , and inspectors allege they got the baby in exchange for paying $800 in hospital bills and other medical expenses . <p> But in most cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are in the country illegally , officials say . The undocumented migrants frequently ask relatives or close friends , or hire smugglers to pose as parents and bring their children across international bridges , often using false documents . <p> So far this year , in Reynosa alone , more than 800 children were temporarily housed in shelters while their relatives were sought . <p> " Over the last 30 days , we 've had a huge influx of those kind of cases , " said U.S. Magistrate Felix Recio in Brownsville . <p> Recio frequently decides the punishment for first-time child smugglers , and he said most defendants claim they are bringing in children for a relative . <p> This is all part and parcel of the immigration problem , " Recio said . People are going to come over here , and they 're going to try and bring their children . " <p> And though the majority of smuggled children are from Mexico , some have made the long trip from Central America . <p> On Nov. 22 , inspectors at the Hidalgo bridge arrested a 45-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two children , ages 8 and 13 . Inspectors learned the children were from Honduras and later found their Honduran birth certificates in the car . <p> It does happen a lot because people think it 's an easy thing to do and ( think ) we 're just going to slap them on the wrists , " said Moreno , who oversees the Hidalgo port . But it 's a very serious thing , and we 're going to file charges . " <p> Most of the smuggled children are turned over to Mexican authorities , who make arrangements to send them back home . <p> Ana Zamarripa , who heads repatriation at Reynosa 's Disarroyo Integral de la Familia youth center , said child smuggling occurs year-round but most frequently when school is out . <p> During all the periods of vacations from school , not just Christmas but Easter , the summer vacations , the numbers go up , " said Zamarripa . <p> The Reynosa center provides hot meals , beds and social services to children who were on their way to the U.S. to be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border to find work . <p> The shelter , housed in a complex of Spanish-colonial-style buildings with landscaped grounds and locked wrought-iron gates patrolled by security guards , provides separate dormitories for girls and boys and a common room with a television . <p> Once the parents are found , they are asked to come to the border to retrieve them . <p> I prefer to talk to parents because I want them to know the risks these kids are taking , " said Zamarripa . " We tell them about the children who drown , the girls who are raped and the dangers of the long hike across the brush , so they wo n't let them go again . " <p> But she acknowledged that many of the children will try to cross the border again . <p> Caught , but not deterred <p> One of the five children at the Reynosa shelter last week was Salomon , a 16-year-old Guatemalan boy from a village devastated by Hurricane Stan in early October . He said his father , mother and brother drowned during the widespread flooding caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , " Salomon recalled . There were five in my family , and the only ones left are me and my brother , who is disabled and in a wheelchair . " <p> The youth was detained outside Reynosa by Mexican immigration agents who searched the bus he traveled on , and he will be sent to a detention center in Mexico City to await deportation to Guatemala . <p> Salomon traveled to Reynosa to find an uncle who lives here and planned to join a cousin in Miami who promised to help him find work . <p> When I get to Guatemala , I 'm going to try and come back now that I know the way , " Salomon said with a sheepish grin , " and I will be more careful . " <p> Brian Levin , the Border Patrol public affairs officer in Tucson , said 80 children have been detained at the six Arizona border stations since Oct. 1 , the beginning of the current fiscal year . In fiscal 2005 , 316 children were detained during smuggling attempts , up from 240 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the border in remote desert areas often pay smugglers to bring children through the border stations , hoping it will be safer . <p> They have a difficult choice to make , " Levin said . They either take the children with them through the desert and risk their lives . Or , they give them to someone they might not even know in the hopes they can meet up again north of the border . " <p> We 've had cases where they ( smugglers ) have given the children aspirin , cough syrup to drug them so the child is unable to answer officers , " Levin said , adding some children required emergency medical attention . <p> Border officials advise travelers , especially those with infants , to bring birth documents for their children when they enter the country . <p> We treat this very seriously , " said Moreno , the official in Hidalgo . We are n't giving people a hard time when we ask a lot of questions . We are just making sure the children are their children , and the documents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOR THE CHRONICLE
