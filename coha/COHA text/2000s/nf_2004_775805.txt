His mother brought him forth in the place that symbolized the Lakota world , the place called the heart of all things , the Black Hills . Not new to the pain of giving birth , she silently endured it with the gentle help of She Who Takes the Babies , the midwife , an old woman whose hands were the first guidance , the first welcome felt by many newborns . Other women were in attendance in the tipi pitched slightly apart from the small encampment , a circle of knowledge and support watching the tiny head with coal black hair emerge into a Lakota world . Later they clucked and cooed and exchanged smiles of satisfaction as he opened his eyes , so deep brown they appeared black . // The circle of women worked quietly , laying the mother down and cleaning off the new life . One of them poked her head out the tipi door to announce to waiting girls that it was a boy , a future provider and protector of his people . So the word was carried to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectant fathers do . // As he heard the news he loaded the bowl of his pipe with tobacco and offered it to Mother Earth , Father Sky , to the Powers of the West , North , East , and South , and finally to the Grandfather , and then quietly smoked his thanksgiving for this new life , this new Lakota come into the world . The new life suckled his mother 's breasts eagerly , anxious to begin his journey . The women in attendance were pleased . One of them sang a soft lullaby , a soft rhythmic chant like a slow heartbeat . Soon his mother helped with the chant , her soft voice joining in , her eyes filled with love as she held her new son close , feeling his moist skin against her bare breasts even as one of the women wrapped a large warm robe around them both , binding mother and son together . By 1840 much of the northern Plains of North America was unmistakably a Lakota world . From the Muddy River ( Missouri ) on the east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Platte ) rivers on the south , the Shining Mountains ( Big Horns ) to the west , and the northern border stretching from the Elk River ( Yellowstone ) east to the Knife flowing into the Muddy , the size of this far-flung world was in keeping with the population of the nation and the determination to protect it . Within this world the people lived by hunting . The people moved camp several times each year to flow with the change of seasons and the movement of the animals they depended on for food and clothing . The tatanka , the bison , was the main source of livelihood . The horse had arrived several generations before and was by then a very important part of Lakota life . It was the other reason the territory was so large . In this Lakota world the life path for sons flowed in two directions that were closely tied to each other , like twin trunks of the same tree . Every boy grew up to be a hunter and a warrior , a provider and a protector . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . Families prayed that each boy would grow up strong of body and mind , that he would heed the lessons of his fathers and grandfathers and honor the path already laid out for him . This was the way . So this new life come into the Lakota world , into the small community encamped in the place known as the heart of all things , was welcomed as new hope , and the people prayed that he would grow straight and strong . The next morning the circle of women who had attended the birth escorted the mother and her new son from the woman 's tipi into the main encampment , to the door of her own lodge , singing songs as they went . People watched and some joined the procession and gifts of welcome were laid next to the door . Among the gifts was a tiny bow with its own tiny arrow , an unmistakable sign of the journey that lay ahead for the new life . Bison robes covered the floor of the lodge and painted rawhide containers-some square and some rectangular-were neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than three , waited anxiously , as did the man of the lodge . The woman entered and walked around the center fire pit and then lowered herself and her bundle carefully into a willow chair set next to the stone altar at the back of the room . Rattling Blanket Woman opened the bundle to show her daughter the thatch of wavy black hair atop her new brother 's head , and then lifted the baby into his father 's arms . He was a modest man , a healer . Crazy Horse was his name , the same as his father 's and which was passed down to him . They were a humble family , part of the Hunkpatila band1 of the Oglala Lakota . She was Mniconju Lakota . Their children thus carried the blood of the Oglala and Mniconju Lakota people . The little one , this new life , this new hope for the people , squirmed in his arms and Crazy Horse felt the promise of goodness and strength within the tiny bundle he held . So the father sang a welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . //
