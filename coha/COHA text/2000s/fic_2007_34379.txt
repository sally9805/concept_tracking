Chapter One Two Years Later Sometimes Cory Briggs took the long way home , pedaling as fast as he could so Megan would n't worry about him . Because Megan said eight-year-old boys should come straight home from soccer practice , especially on late afternoons . San Francisco was the sort of city where it was best if you were in by dark . But that early August day , Cory did it again . He slipped his backpack onto his shoulders , left the soccer field at McKinley Elementary , and rode his bike up the hill and a few blocks out of the way , to Duboce Park . He would make up time on the downhill , so he stopped just outside the fenced-in play area and stared . Shadows made it hard to see the bench , the one where he and his mom used to sit . But Cory shaded his eyes with his hand and squinted , and suddenly there it was . The same bench , same brown wooden slats , same way it looked back when he was a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't blink , did n't break the lock he had on the bench , and after a minute he could hear her again , her happy voice telling him everything would be okay . " God has good plans for us , Cory . " She would kiss his cheek and smile at him . But her eyes were n't always happy , even when she smiled . " We 'll find our way out together . " He remembered her still . He blinked now because he did n't want to cry . A bit of wind blew against his back , and Cory squinted against the tears . The day was hot , but already the bay breeze was cooling it off , which meant it was time to go . He climbed back up onto his seat and looked at the bench one more time . His mom was buried in Oakland somewhere . Megan took him once in a while , but Oakland was far away . When he needed to see her one more time , when he wanted to hear her voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of her , God , " he whispered . Then without another look back , he set off along the sidewalk pedaling hard as he could , turning down Delores to Seventeenth , and the third story apartment where he and Megan lived . Cory knew the streets between his school and his apartment . He even knew the way to Monster Park , where the 49ers played . But Megan would never let him ride his bike all the way to the stadium . That was okay . It was enough just knowing it was close . Because once a year he and the kids from his neighborhood entered a drawing for tickets to a game , and this year ... this year he was going to win . He focused on the ride . He knew which alleys to stay away from , and which areas had gang members standing around . He took the streets with the least traffic lights , because that was smarter . He had to stop for only three before he reached their building , jumped off his bike , and walked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they fit , and his did . At the third floor he stepped off and already he could hear it . The sound of happiness . Laughing and loud voices coming from the Florentinos ' apartment . He walked past two doors and stopped . The smell of spaghetti and garlic bread slipped beneath the door and filled the hallway . Sometimes , when Megan had to work late , he would knock on the Florentinos ' door and they 'd invite him in for dinner . They had seven kids , but Mrs. Florentino said she always had an extra plate . Cory raised his hand to knock , because Megan might not be home yet . Then he remembered . She 'd made a Crock-Pot dinner this morning because she got paid first of the month . He walked his bike to the end of the hall to No. 312 . The newspaper was there , opened , and a little scattered . The Florentinos got the paper every day , and after they read it , they set it outside his and Megan 's door . Megan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could take a copy free . That 's what she said . So instead , Mrs. Florentino brought over hers , and that way Cory could read about the 49ers . Especially now , in the preseason . He used his key and walked into their apartment . Then he set down his backpack and the paper , walked across the room , and opened the front window . Nothing but alleys and winos below , but Cory loved having it open . A little bit of summer came in with the breeze . Oreo , the cat , rubbed against his ankle . " Hi , boy . " Cory bent down and rubbed his fur . He was black and white with a lot of gray around the whiskers . Some days he was Cory 's best friend . Cory straightened and looked around . The apartment was small , but it was clean . Megan liked clean . And almost every day she left a snack for him . Cory went to the table , and there on a napkin , were two chocolate chip cookies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink your milk , " Megan always told him . At the other end of the table was the Scrabble box . Each day was a different game . Sometimes Yahtzee or a deck of cards or Memory . But Scrabble was their favorite . They 'd eat dinner first and then they 'd play a game before homework . Megan was nice that way . Plus , the TV only got four channels clear . So board games were good . Cory poured himself a glass of milk and sat at the table . The cookies were n't warm , of course , but they tasted like smooth vanilla and Hershey bars . Because that 's how Megan made them . Which was nice because Megan did n't have much time . Early mornings , before he was awake , she delivered the Chronicle , and after that , she worked all day at Bob 's Diner downtown . Two jobs because she said that 's what it took to keep food on the table . There was the sound of a key in the door and then it opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a grocery bag in her hands and her cheeks were red , the way they got when she walked fast . She held up the bag . " Fudge brownie ice cream . " " The best ! " Cory stood and ran to her and hugged her tight . When he 'd first come to live with Megan , he did n't like to hug her because she was n't his mom . But she was his mom 's friend . And after two years , hugging her was almost as good as it used to feel to hug his mom . Plus , Megan liked the 49ers . So that made her and the apartment feel like home . Especially during football season . Cory took the grocery bag . " Thanks . " He grinned at her . " The Crock-Pot smells good . " " Not as good as Mrs. Florentino 's dinner , but ... " She grinned . " It 's the best we can do . " " Yep . " He helped put the ice cream in the freezer , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay closed that good . " Salad ? " He opened the fridge and looked at her . " Of course . " She lifted the lid on the Crock-Pot . " Always salad . " He took out the head of lettuce and a worn-out knife from the drawer . If he had money of his own , he 'd buy Megan some new knives . Forks too . And maybe a warmer sweater for the days she had to walk fast after dark . They worked together , and Cory smiled to himself . It felt nice having Megan there . When they were sitting at the table eating the Crock-Pot dinner , Cory watched her a couple times when she was n't looking . She was pretty , and she loved him like he was her own . That 's what she said . And maybe she could keep him for good if the court hearings went okay . So far Megan said it was nothing but red tape and the runaround . Whatever that meant . Megan put her fork down . " I talked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " I told her I want to adopt you , Cory . " He finished chewing a bite of potato . " What 'd she say ? " " She said " - Megan raised one eyebrow and looked straight at him- " you told her the same thing . About having a dad . " Cory shrugged . " Yeah . " He studied the pieces of meat still on his plate . Then he looked into her eyes . " Everyone has a dad . " She gave him a look that said no-funny-business-mister . " You know what I mean . " A sad breath came from her . " If you tell her your dad 's in the picture , we 'll need his signature . I ca n't adopt you until he says so . " " Right . " Cory checked his dinner again . He poked his fork around and pushed the carrots to one side . " If we get his signature ... I can meet him . " Megan waited for a second . Then she breathed long and loud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . " They talked about soccer practice and the other guys on the team and about her work at the restaurant , because she had a rich guy come in today , a big baldy , who left her a twenty-dollar tip . " That 's why the ice cream ! " Cory raised his fork in the air . " Exactly . " After dinner , they played Scrabble , but Cory could n't think about big words . Some turns he could n't think about any words at all . He wanted to read the newspaper , the sports section . Because the 49ers were getting ready for the season and he did n't want to miss a single story . Megan won with the word zebras , and Cory hugged her . " Good job . " He took a few steps back . " I 'm gon na read the paper . " " How about the dishes first ? " Megan had dark hair , and she tossed it over her shoulder when she stood up . It was easy to think of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe twenty-nine or thirty . But she was twenty-five . Megan said that was n't exactly young and that she had an old soul . The two of them washed dishes , him scrubbing the plates and Megan rinsing . When they were finally done , he grabbed the paper and ran it to the couch . He was halfway through the sports section when he saw it . The headline read , " Derrick Anderson Hosts Pizza Party at Youth Center . " Cory raced through the short story . It talked about how Derrick Anderson loved foster kids , and that he was having a pizza party on Friday night at the youth center . All foster kids and their parents were invited . " No way ! " Cory shouted . " Megan , look at this ! " She was washing off the counter and made a little laugh . " Must be big . Read it to me . " " It is big ! " He read her the story , every line , and then he let the paper fall to the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could meet Derrick Anderson ! He 's the backup quarterback for the 49ers , the famous one who used to play for the Bears . Remember him ? " " The whole world knows Derrick Anderson . " She did a sad sort of smile . " Well , they used to know him . Back in his prime . " " What ? " Cory jumped around . " He 's still in his prime , Megan ! He 's thirty-nine , and he 's still one of the best quarterbacks in the league . " He jumped some more . " I ca n't believe we can meet him . " He stopped , his eyes wide . " We can , right ? Can we ? Please , Megan ? " Her eyes twinkled . " Are you kidding ? " She messed her fingers through his hair . " That 's the best Friday night offer I 've had for a year , at least . " " Did you know about this , the pizza night ? " Cory blinked at her . Megan volunteered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should 've heard about this long before the newspaper . Her eyes danced . " I had an idea . But I wanted to be sure before I told you . The 49ers ' front office set it up . I guess the team wants to do whatever it can for the city . With all the talk about building a new stadium thirty miles south in Santa Clara . " " Yeah . " Cory did n't like thinking about a new stadium . The 49ers had played at the same place since 1971 . They were the best pro sports franchise in the state . Anyone knew that . Plus , Megan said if the mayor convinced the 49ers to stay in the city , they were going to build a bunch of new houses and stuff . Cory and Megan would have to move for sure . He blinked and tried to forget about the whole stadium thing . " Besides , Derrick 's doing the pizza party for a different reason . " " Oh , really ? " Megan gave him a half smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . " Megan tilted her head , and her eyes said she was done teasing . " I think you 're right . " " So " - he felt his heart dance around inside him- " We 're going ? " A laugh came from Megan . " Definitely . " He grinned and held out his hand , official-like . " Okay , then . It 's a date . " " Date . " She shook his fingers , and then she laughed and went back to wiping the counter . Cory picked up the paper again and stacked it on the sofa . Friday was only four days away . Which meant it was n't too soon to do what he 'd done a hundred times before . He ran to his room , pulled a box out from beneath the bunk bed , and grabbed a piece of paper and a pencil . He took out a dictionary to use for his table , and he started to write . Every other time he 'd done this , he never actually gave the letter away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he could n't just send it off without knowing where it would go , or if it would even be opened . So usually , he wrote the letter and threw it away . Or tucked it into his box , or his backpack . In case he ever ran into the guy at the park or something . But this ... this was the most exciting thing to ever happen , because Derrick Anderson could deliver his letter , Cory was sure . And maybe these were the good plans from God his mother had always told him about . Cory thought for a long time . He would write the best letter yet , stick it in the nicest envelope , and write across the front . So Derrick would know who to give it to . And Derrick would do it , because he loved foster kids . The Chronicle said so . And the letter was for one of Derrick 's teammates , one of the most famous football players in the country . A man Cory prayed every night he might someday meet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to meet him because he was the city 's favorite football player . He wanted to meet him for a different reason . Because Aaron Hill was his dad .
