The thing you can count on in life is that Tennessee will always be scorching hot in August . In 1985 you could also pretty much count on the fact that the U-Haul truck you rented to drive from Tennessee to Iowa , cutting up through Missouri , would have no air-conditioning or that the air-conditioning would be broken . These are the things I knew for sure when I left home to start graduate school . The windows were down in the truck and my stepsister , Tina , was driving . We sat on towels to keep our bare legs from adhering to the black vinyl seats and licked melted M&amp;Ms off our fingers . My feet were on the dashboard and we were singing because the radio had gone the way of the air conditioner . " Going to the chapel and we 're  --  gon na get mar-ar-aried . " We knew all the words to that one . Tina had the better voice , one more reason I was grateful she had agreed to come along for the ride . I was twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole prospect seemed as simple as that : rent a truck , take a few leftover pots and pans and a single bed mattress from the basement of my mother 's house , pack up my typewriter . The hills of the Tennessee Valley flattened out before we got to Memphis and as we headed north the landscape covered over with corn . The blue sky blanched white in the heat . I leaned out the window and thought , Good , no distractions . // I had been to Iowa City once before in June to find a place to live . I was looking for two apartments then , one for myself and one for Lucy Grealy , who I had gone to college with . I got a note from Lucy not long after receiving my acceptance letter from the Iowa Writers ' Workshop . She said that initially when she heard I had gotten into the workshop she was sorry , because she had wanted to be the only student there from Sarah Lawrence . But then our mutual friend Jono Wilks had told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the case , would I find a place for her as well ? She could n't afford to make the trip to look herself and so it went without saying that she was on a very tight budget . I sat at the kitchen table and looked at her handwriting , which seemed oddly scrawny and uncertain , like a note on a birthday card from an elderly aunt . I had never seen her writing before , and certainly these were the only words she had ever addressed to me . While Lucy and I would later revise our personal history to say we had been friends since we met as freshmen , just for the pleasure of adding a few more years to the tally , the truth was we did not know each other at all in college . Or the truth was that I knew her and she did not know me . Even at Sarah Lawrence , a school full of models and actresses and millionaire daughters of industry , everyone knew Lucy and everyone knew her story : she had had a Ewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through five years of the most brutal radiation and chemotherapy , and then undergone a series of reconstructive surgeries that were largely unsuccessful . The drama of her life , combined with her reputation for being the smartest student in all of her classes , made her the campus mascot , the favorite pet in her dirty jeans and oversized Irish sweaters . She kept her head tipped down so that her long dark blond hair fell over her face to hide the fact that part of her lower jaw was missing . From a distance you would have thought she had lost something , money or keys , and that she was vigilantly searching the ground trying to find it . // It was Lucy 's work-study job to run the film series on Friday and Saturday nights , and before she would turn the projector on , it was up to her to walk in front of the screen and explain that in accordance with the New York State Fire Marshal , exits were located at either side of the theater . Only she could n't say it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming and applauding and chanting her name , " LOO-cee , LOO-cee , LOO-cee ! " She would wrap her arms around her head and twist from side to side , mortified , loving it . Her little body , the body of an underfed eleven-year-old , was visibly shaking inside her giant sweaters . Finally her embarrassment reached such proportions that the audience recognized it and settled down . She had to speak her lines . " In accordance with the New York State Fire Marshal , " she would begin . She was shouting , but her voice was smaller than the tiny frame it came from . It was no more than a whisper once it passed the third row . // I watched this show almost every weekend . It was as great a part of the evening 's entertainment as seeing Jules et Jim . Being shy myself , I did not come to shout her name until our junior year . By then she would wave to the audience as they screamed for her . She would bow from the waist . She had cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boyish , a large cowlick sweeping up from her pale forehead . We could see her face clearly . It was always changing , swollen after a surgery or sinking in on itself after a surgery had failed . One year she walked with a cane and someone told me it was because they had taken a chunk of her hip to grind up and graft into her jaw . // We knew things about Lucy the way one knows things about the private lives of movie stars , by a kind of osmosis of information ... //
