With Anthrax in the mail and a war under way whose end is nowhere in sight , it 's hardly surprising that a lot of people are feeling anxious these days . For most of us , the tightness in the stomach comes at moments of crisis , but it 's manageable , and it goes away again . For others , though  --  especially those who tend to be anxious anyway  --  the feeling can be overwhelming . And while such severe anxiety can be transient , it can sometimes persist for weeks  --  or even longer . <P> Fortunately , there are plenty of things you can do about it , including taking medication  --  but that 's a last resort . The first step in dealing with anxiety , says Richard Friedman , psychiatrist and director of the Psychopharmacology Clinic at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan , is realizing that " it 's normal to feel anxious in reaction to the catastrophe . Do n't avoid it ; talk to your friends and family . " <P> Next , says Friedman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not alcohol : that might take the edge off briefly , but the anxiety will return . Much better to try healthy anxiety reducers like deep breathing , exercise , yoga or meditation . A hot bath is also a good idea , and a cup of herbal tea like Tension Tamer can do just what it says . <P> But what if your anxiety is sustained and acute ? If you have the following symptoms and ca n't shake them , you may want to see a professional : an inability to relax , a free-floating , persistent sense of distress , difficulty concentrating , trouble sleeping and rapid heartbeat . And for these , a psychologist or psychiatrist might recommend medication . <P> Which kind depends on the nature of the anxiety . If it 's part of a chronic , underlying problem such as depression or something called " generalized anxiety disorder , " the doctor would probably prescribe a so-called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor such as Paxil . Such inhibitors take up to six weeks to begin working . But by putting your brain chemistry back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the anxiety . <P> If your distress is a specific ( though out-of-control ) reaction to an outward stimulus like the current crisis , then Paxil and the others are " wrong , wrong , wrong , " says Friedman . Episodic anxiety is best treated with an entirely different class of drugs known as benzodiazepines , including Valium , Xanax , Ativan and Klonopin . These work within minutes , not weeks  --  but they 're potentially addictive , so they should n't be used for more than two weeks or so . <P> Finally , if anxiety is making it tough to fall asleep , there are sleeping pills . These include Halcion , Ambien and Restoril  --  and , like other true antianxiety drugs , they carry the potential for abuse . It 's O.K. to use them if you really must . But it 's better to deal with insomnia in other ways first  --  if you 're tossing and turning , leave the bedroom and try reading . These pills are strong medications that should be used only with caution . <P> For more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
