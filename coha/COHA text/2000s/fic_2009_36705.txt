March 1856 <p> " It 'll be all right . " Sarah Dobbs wrapped her arms around the child , wishing with all her heart that she could believe the words she 'd uttered so often . The truth was , it did n't matter what she believed . All that mattered was keeping Thea safe . And so Sarah knelt on the hard-packed dirt of San Antonio 's main street to wipe the tears from her sister 's cheeks . The child was hot , tired , and excited by the unusual sights , a combination that turned normally sweet-tempered Thea querulous . <p> " Let me see , sweetie . " Sarah reached for her sister 's hands , giving each of the tiny palms a kiss . Thank goodness , this time Thea had not hurt herself . When she 'd run and tumbled , trying to chase a burro , all she 'd done was torn her hem again . The dress could be repaired far more easily than the skinned hands and knees that had been almost daily occurrences since they 'd left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sarah repeated , rising as gracefully as she could . It will be all right , she told herself , when Austin arrives . The journey that had been more difficult than she had dreamt possible was almost over . Once she and Thea reached Ladreville and the Bar C , the past would truly end . The old Sarah Dobbs would be gone forever . <p> " Walk ? " Thea gave Sarah a look only a curmudgeon could refuse . Sarah was not a curmudgeon . She was a woman whose right leg was protesting the exercise and whose common sense was shouting that she and Thea should not remain in the hot Texas sun . She was also a woman who knew how desperately Thea needed to expend some of her seemingly endless supply of energy . <p> " A short walk . " Sarah smiled as a grin crossed the child 's face . It took so little to please Thea . How could anyone have ... ? Deliberately , Sarah bit the inside of her cheek . That 's all past , she reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , she walked slowly and deliberately , trying to minimize her limp as she looked for the man who held the key to her future . <p> Where was he ? Where was Austin Canfield ? Sarah kept a tight grip on Thea 's hand as they made their way down the street . Her tumble forgotten , Thea giggled at the sight of oxen with almost unbelievably long horns pulling two-wheeled carts . <p> There was no denying the differences between this city and Philadelphia . They were as real as the warmth that felt more like midsummer than the last days of winter , as real as the smells of dust and dung and dried leaves . But the greatest difference was sensed rather than seen or heard . There was a contagious vitality about this frontier town . Sarah saw it in the way men swaggered rather than strolled ; she heard it in the shouted greetings . Whether they spoke Spanish or English , enthusiasm was evident in every word . Texas was young and brash and exciting . It was everything she sought , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't . There was no doubt about that , just as there had been no doubt the previous dozen times she had looked for him . Though the center of San Antonio bustled with life , there was no one who fit his description . I 'm four inches over six feet , he had written , with sandy hair and blue eyes , and when I see you , I 'll be wearing a grin as big as the state of Texas . Sarah had smiled when she had read his words . Texans , she had heard , were prone to exaggeration . She was n't smiling now . The last of their traveling companions had departed half an hour ago , leaving Sarah and Thea alone , more than a thousand miles and a lifetime away from home . She shook her head slowly , negating her last thought . Philadelphia was n't home . Not anymore . <p> " Papa ! " Thea tugged Sarah 's hand and started to run across the road . Though they had n't been there a moment ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the street and were lounging in the doorway . <p> " No , sweetie . " Sarah wrapped her arms around her sister , restraining her . Neither of those men was the new father who had promised to meet them , the man who was now an hour late . <p> As if they had heard Thea 's cry , the cowboys approached Sarah . " Might we be of assistance , ma'am ? " Sarah shook her head . When it had been apparent that Austin Canfield was n't waiting for the stagecoach , the other woman who had traveled with them had advised waiting inside the town hall , which Texans referred to by its Spanish name , cabildo , but Sarah , knowing that Thea would hate being cooped up in yet another small space , had remained outside . She had believed her mourning garb and the presence of a small child at her side would discourage unwanted attention . That had been the case on the train and the stagecoaches . But San Antonio was different . Texans were as friendly as Philadelphians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen . My fiancT will be here momentarily . " She hoped it was n't a lie . <p> Though the men exchanged amused glances , they retreated . With a sigh of relief , Sarah looked at the clock tower . She would wait for five minutes longer . If Austin had n't arrived by then , she and Thea would go inside . <p> Where was he ? Sarah looked around for what seemed like the hundredth time , hoping that a tall , sandy-haired rancher would appear . He did n't . She took another deep breath as she considered the reasons he might not have come . Perhaps his horse had gone lame . Perhaps a wheel had fallen off the wagon . Those were possibilities , and they were far more palatable than the alternative . Surely Austin had n't changed his mind . Surely he had n't been lying when he 'd written those wonderful letters . Surely he was n't going to abandon her and Thea the way everyone in Philadelphia had . Or was he ? <p> " No , sweetie . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the things Sarah could not do . Was that the reason Austin was not here ? She paused as doubts assailed her . Had Austin reconsidered and realized he had no desire to wed a woman whose right leg was twisted and scarred and an inch shorter than her left ? <p> Sarah reached into her reticule and touched the packet of letters , trying to reassure herself . " You speak of your imperfections as though the rest of us bore no blemishes . " There was no need to open the envelopes and withdraw the pages , for she had memorized the words Austin had written , just as she had engraved upon her mind the appearance of the brash handwriting that was somehow at odds with the eloquent phrases . " My dearest Sarah , if there is one thing I have learned , it is that no one is perfect . But you , my sweet wife-to-be , are closer to perfection than you know . " <p> She was n't perfect . Far from it . Still , her heart had soared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin who was perfect , for he had somehow known exactly the right words to woo her . Sarah had n't expected to be courted . This was , after all , a business arrangement . But there was no denying the fact that she had reveled in Austin Canfield 's letters . They had been the one ray of light in those horrible months after Mama and Papa 's deaths . <p> Reverend Lang claimed they were proof that God loved her and was watching over her . Sarah knew otherwise . God had deserted her and so , it appeared , had her bridegroom . <p> * * * <p> What else could go wrong ? Clay Canfield bit back an oath as he stared at the mare . It was n't her fault . When he had come into the stable to harness the horses , Clay had discovered Nora ailing . If the fact that instead of greeting him eagerly as she did each day was n't enough , the sorrel mare lay curled in a ball . Those big brown eyes lacked their normal sparkle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carrot from his pocket . Clay clenched his fist , snapping the carrot from the force of his grip . He did n't need this . Indeed , he did not . The last thing he needed was an ailing horse , particularly today . But he had one . <p> " Miguel , " he called when he heard the stable hand 's heavy tread , " Nora 's sick . You 'd better look at the others before you feed them . " Clay knelt next to the mare and checked her gums , nodding when he saw they were still pink . " C'm on , girl . " He reached for Nora 's halter . " It 's just a touch of colic . " Clay was n't certain of that . It was , he had discovered over the past year , easier to treat people than animals . Humans told you what hurt , while horses could only look at you with mournful eyes . Nora might have colic ; she might have something else . The one thing Clay knew for certain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , had been the site of far too many Canfield deaths . <p> Clay glanced at his black armband and shuddered as waves of pain and anger swept through him . The man responsible for that would pay . Unfortunately , not today . <p> " C'm on , Nora . " Clay spoke softly as he slid the halter over her head . " We 're gon na get you on your feet and walk a bit . " That had helped the last time the mare had had colic . With a little luck , it would work again . Clay 's lips twisted in a wry smile . He was the last person on earth who should expect luck to favor him . <p> " I 'm taking Nora out . " Miguel knew what to do in the stable . Clay walked , slowly at first , leading the mare around the paddock , trying not to look at the horizon , where the sun was even now tinting the sky . He should have been on the road by now . Instead ... <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her muzzle . " It 's all right , girl . We 'll get you feeling better soon . " <p> With her flaxen mane and tail and the white blaze , Nora was a beautiful horse . Despite her advanced age , Clay had received offers to buy her , offers that he 'd refused without a second 's consideration . He 'd never sell Ma 's horse . Nora deserved to live out her days on the Bar C. That was why Clay was taking endless circles around the paddock , trying not to think of how much time had passed since he 'd discovered Nora lying in her stall , trying desperately not to think of the last time Nora had left the Bar C and how she 'd returned , a lifeless body draped over her back . <p> Clay forced himself to take a deep breath . They 'd keep walking . And they did . It was only when Nora 's digestive tract was once again functioning normally that Clay returned her to the stable . <p> " Good news , boss , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The others are all fine . " <p> " That is good news . " The first of the day . The first in a long time . Clay rubbed Nora 's nose again before giving her a ration of bran . <p> " I thought you were going to San Antonio today . " Miguel 's voice came from the other end of the stable , where he 'd started to muck out stalls . <p> Clay shrugged his shoulders . " I was . I am . " He looked down at his sweat-stained shirt and wrinkled his nose . He could n't go looking or smelling like this . As he headed for the pump , Clay glanced up . The sun was now above the horizon , staining the sky a bright red that promised unseasonable warmth . It would be a good day for travel , if a man wanted to travel . Clay did not , at least not when that traveling involved a return trip to Ladreville and the Bar C. Unfortunately , what he wanted did n't change anything . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the house . As he pulled out his watch , Clay frowned again . He 'd be late . There was no way around that . Caring for Nora had taken more than two hours . Though he had planned to arrive in San Antonio before the stagecoach , now he would be late . Very late , and that meant Miss Sarah Dobbs and her little sister would have to wait . <p> Clay climbed into the wagon that Miguel had harnessed . It was n't fair . The woman had traveled all the way from Philadelphia , expecting to be met by her bridegroom . Instead , she would be forced to wait , and when that waiting ended , the only things she would have were Clay and a message he would have given almost anything not to be delivering . It was n't fair , but life , Clay had discovered on far too many occasions , was n't fair . <p> He tightened his grip on the reins . If he 'd been able to ride Shadow , he could have made up lost time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed to transport Miss Sarah Dobbs and all her earthly possessions to Ladreville . So here he was , driving the wagon , while the sun 's inexorable rise reminded him of just how late he was and how many miles he had yet to cover before he met his brother 's bride . <p> And the child . Must n't forget the child that Austin had claimed was part of God 's plan . Some plan . Clay clenched his fists , trying to fight back the pain . Why ? he demanded . Why did you let it happen ? Austin believed in you . He said you were a loving God . There was no answer . It appeared God was not listening . No surprise there . God had n't listened to Clay Canfield in a long time . And , it appeared , he had not been listening to Austin , either . That was why Clay was on his way to San Antonio to meet the Canfield bride . And the child . <p> What would she do when she learned the truth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . As the red ball lit the horizon , the horses continued to lower their heads . Clay wished he could follow suit , but-unlike them-he needed to watch more than the road . This country held hazards far more serious than potholes , including marauding Comanche . And at the end of the road was the greatest hazard , at least to Clay 's equilibrium : Miss Sarah Dobbs . <p> How would she react ? How would any woman handle the announcement he was forced to make ? Clay lowered his chin in another vain attempt to keep the sun from blinding him . If Patience had been faced with the news , what would she have done ? Would she have swooned or simply wept buckets of tears ? Clay had seen her do both when she had been upset . He squinted , and this time it was not in response to the sun 's rays . Odd . He could not conjure the image of his wife 's face . That had never happened before . Clay shook his head , trying to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman whose stagecoach was even now lumbering into San Antonio . <p> How was he going to tell her ? An hour later as he drove the wagon into the heart of the city , Clay was still searching for the words to make the announcement easier to bear . <p> He stared at the woman who stood in front of the cabildo , a small child at her side , looking at the town hall 's clock tower with what appeared to be barely controlled impatience . Though he could see only her back , there was something about the tilt of her head that spoke of anger . Clay could n't blame her for that . In a similar situation , he doubted he would have bothered to mask his impatience . The stagecoach had arrived over an hour earlier . Austin should have been here , ready to help her alight from the coach , showing her that he was as eager to marry her as his letters had claimed . Instead , Miss Sarah Dobbs and her sister had been left alone in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mesquite in a Boston parlor . <p> The woman turned slightly , revealing her profile . There was no doubt about it . This was Sarah . Clay would have known her , even without the miniature she had sent to Austin . " Medium height , medium brown hair , medium brown eyes , " she had written in one of her letters . This woman was all that , and more . Though her fancy clothing was the first clue , the slightly imperious tilt of her head and the proud angle of her shoulders announced to the world that this was a lady , an Eastern lady . She turned again , and this time she looked directly at Clay , her eyes flickering from the top of his hat down his dusty clothes before she dismissed him . The action surprised Clay almost as much as the fact that she had remained outdoors rather than seeking the sanctuary of the cabildo . Sarah Dobbs was no shy miss . Instead , she appeared to possess more self-assurance than he had expected , certainly more than Patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be the one to destroy that confidence . <p> Trying to control his anger , he jumped out of the wagon and approached his brother 's fiancTe . " Miss Dobbs , " he said softly as he doffed his hat , not wanting to startle her . Two cowboys on the opposite side of the street appeared to be keeping watch . Clay suspected that if Miss Dobbs let out a cry of alarm , their protective instincts might result in a brawl . He most definitely did not need that . " Miss Dobbs , " he repeated , a bit louder this time . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
