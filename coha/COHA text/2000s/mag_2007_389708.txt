FERTILITY STRUGGLES I am writing in regard to " 3 Friends , 3 Paths to Pregnancy " The Fertility Diaries , April . I relate so much to what these women are going through , especially Jody . But I want to tell her not to give up . My husband and I did in vitro fertilization , and much to our joy it worked on the first try ! Today , we have two beautiful daughters . Jody , your efforts have truly inspired me , and please know you are not alone in your journey . Thank you for sharing your lives with REDBOOK readers ! Barbara Peck Prospect , CT Editor 's note : Read more about Jody , Jenny , and Carrie 's journey to motherhood on page 174  --  plus , check out the launch of Julia Litton 's infertility blog at **26;2014;TOOLONG . FATHER KNOWS BEST ? I was very disappointed to read " What 's the Nicest Thing You 've Done for Someone Else ? " Star Stories , April . Two of the celebrities you featured said that they help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that it is nice that they help , in today 's society , it is expected that fathers care for their children . If this were still the 1950s , men like Ben Affleck and Jack Black might have been commended for their child- care efforts , but in 2007 they should certainly have something else to add to their " nice list . " There are plenty of other celebrities doing things to help people besides changing their own children 's diapers , which millions of regular mothers and fathers do every day !

UNDERSTANDING KIDS ' TICS I just picked up the April issue on a whim , and after reading " Does That Tic Mean Trouble ? " I 'm definitely going to subscribe to REDBOOK . I had never seen tic disorders mentioned in any magazine until now . Our 8-year-old son was diagnosed with transient tic disorder two years ago . Since then , he has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , throat clearing , and twirling . It 's just a part of him now and something we hope he will grow out of in time . We do n't really notice it much anymore , and when others do we tell them what it is and how we are treating it  --  which includes seeing a chiropractor and opting not to put him on medication . There are so many options for parents out there going through this . Well-done on a great article , and thank you for printing it ! Stacia Hile Milton , PA THE MEANING OF ADOPTION As progressive as REDBOOK can sometimes be , I was disappointed to read the article " Lauren Holly 's House of Men " April . Before the subject matter was even brought up , the introduction referred to her " adopted boys . " Why are n't they just her sons ? My sister is adopted , but I do n't go around referring to her as my " adopted sister . " She 's just my sister . I also thought about this when reading Red Letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that she and her husband had decided that adoption was not for them and instead chose to live a child-free life . She did not specify why , but I ca n't help but question the motives of a person who tries infertility treatments for years but chooses to remain childless rather than adopting . Adoption is a wonderful option for anyone , and it ensures that if you want to be a parent , you can be . Let 's not put a bad spin on a good thing . Rebecca Z. Denver DOGGIE DO 'S AND DON'TS I was so thrilled to see your article on Cesar Millan in " Be the Alpha Dog " March . Having just read his book Cesar 's Way , and having been a trainer for over 15 years , I ca n't say enough great things about Cesar 's insight with dogs . I have personally added his techniques when training , and dogs do respond well to his methods and do become better pets . Thanks for sharing Cesar 's expert advice  --  I think many owners will benefit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARD TIMES I just wanted to say thank you for the article " Kristin Armstrong : Life After Lance " March . I found her approach to life following her divorce very inspirational . In today 's society , such strong faith in God is rare . Kristin 's faith is not only beautiful and refreshing , but is something we should all emulate . Angel Pacheco Brick , NJ FROM THE MALE FILES : HILARIOUS ( AND HOT ? ) EX-HUSBAND ! I am divorced and my ex-wife 's new husband was one of your 18 finalists in the Hottest Husband Contest . Many friends think that I am pretty hot as well . Therefore , I 'm wondering if you are planning a hottest ex-husband contest of any kind . If not , I 'm planning on going over to the couch and putting some weight on . Please advise .
