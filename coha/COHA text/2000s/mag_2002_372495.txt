George Bush signed John McCain 's campaign-finance-reform bill with as little fanfare as he could last week  --  he even had an aide phone the Arizona Senator with the news instead of inviting him to a signing ceremony . Bush hopes enactment of the bill , which McCain has pushed for seven years , finally shifts the spotlight away from his nemesis in the 2000 Republican presidential primary . G.O.P. Senators would also like a breather from McCain 's legislative reforms . <P> Do n't bet on it . In an interview with TIME , McCain says he wants to capitalize on the campaign-reform bill 's success by following it with other initiatives , such as getting states to adopt campaign-reform laws and giving the Federal Elections Commission greater enforcement power . <P> McCain also wants to halt a practice Congress holds dear  --  " earmarking " federal funds in budgets for pork-barrel projects back home . The appropriations bills for 2002 have more than 7,800 earmarks . The waste " has become outrageous and obscene , " says McCain . Earmarks in the 2002 defense bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3.6 billion . <P> McCain plans to mobilize the grass-roots activists enlisted for the campaign-reform bill and his presidential bid to push these causes . But many members of Congress , re-elected on how much bacon they bring home , will fight to keep earmarking even more fiercely than they did soft money . Says a senior Senate G.O.P. aide : " McCain will be able to make his points on 20/20 , but it 's highly unlikely he 'll get legislation passed . " <P>  --  By Douglas Waller
