<p> After frequently traveling to Canada , I have learned a lot about the nation to our north . It 's ' or-gan-eye-zation . ' The gold-colored coin is the ' loonie ' - or a dollar . The Goods and Services Tax is a monumental pain in the um , wallet . <p> Toronto has a vibrant mini-Broadway district , and it is the fiefdom of one theater and restaurant czar . Barenaked Ladies not only is the best rock group to come from Canada since the Guess Who , bare-naked ladies are also ( well , pretty darned near ) what the tabloid papers put next to the sports column to sell more papers . <p> That about covers it , right ? <p> Of course it does n't . <p> Canada remains often European in tradition and feel as a member of the British Commonwealth , and with its French-Canadian roots . It also is increasingly diverse , complex and vibrant . <p> Hockey is part of the fabric of Canadian tradition , yet when the Winnipeg Jets went to Phoenix and the Quebec Nordiques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation will survive if the exodus of teams from its smaller markets to the United States continues and soon only the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens remain . <p> Yet if I were Canadian , I would have argued during the debate over the past few years that highly qualified federal aid provisions for the six NHL franchises in the nation would have been justifiable , both economically and otherwise - at least until the NHL 's collective-bargaining agreement ends in 2004 . ( No salary cap then ? No more federal aid . ) <p> Last week , such a reasonable , highly qualified plan was announced in Ottawa . Local and provincial governments had to step up first , and if they did n't , there would be no federal aid . <p> Yes , the possible $ 2 million in federal aid per team under that plan was about what an NHL second-line winger makes . Canadians essentially were being asked to send a Finnish left wing to camp - and subsidize him through the regular season in a nation struggling to fund education and health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But the social and economic impact of the NHL 's presence in six Canadian markets is worth that $ 2 million in federal aid per franchise . The franchises pay exorbitant taxes , especially when compared with USA-based teams , and no The criticism of the announced plan was both fervent and predictable . Both in the USA and Canada , it 's always been galling when the tunnel-vision , holier-than-thou intelligentsia assume that anyone who likes sports never has read a book or attended a play - at federally aided libraries and performing arts centers . Intelligent men and women can even love sports without trying to portray the pitchout as a metaphor for our military strategy in Vietnam . Intelligent men and women with eclectic interests and rich lives can enjoy sports as much , or even more so , than the blinkered morons who do nothing but listen to sports-talk radio and consider anything beyond the sports section to be irrelevant . <p> After all of that as a prologue , this is what I do n't understand : The Canadians argued for at least two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada spent tons of money studying , debating and pondering the alternatives , before the Ottawa federal government announced the very conditional federal aid package for NHL franchises in the middle of last week . <p> Then it took all of two days for Federal Industry Minister John Manley to pull the plug and say last Friday : Never mind . The critics were not to be dismissed as cranks . Their viewpoints , in most cases , were reasonable . But those views were considered , and heard , during the deliberative process . <p> Explain this to me , Canadians : Why , after all of this debating , did n't the politicians have enough guts to say , ' This is our job , and this is what we 're going to try ' ? Do they have so little faith in their own judgment , and so little nerve , to let the plan reached after tortuous discussion live for more than 48 hours ? <p> AROUND THE LEAGUE <p> We have a Chris Simon sighting . <p> The former Avalanche enforcer , whose career since his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals in 40 games for the Washington Capitals . He always showed a decent touch while playing with skilled players with the Avs , often on a line with Joe Sakic , and now he is productive again . <p> ' A lot of people have never seen him when he 's healthy , ' Capitals coach Ron Wilson said when Washington played at Toronto . ' When he 's healthy , I think he can score 25 or 30 goals . When you say that , people laugh because of his pugilistic prowess . But this is the first time he has been healthy in three years . ' <p> Simon has been playing with center Adam Oates . ' He 's a great passer , ' Simon said after scoring twice against the Maple Leafs . ' It just seems like he was finding me out there every time I was open . ' <p> Simon is providing part of the spark as the Capitals have run off an 8-0-1 streak . <p> Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts , a one-time Nuggets executive , is smiling about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feeling grateful the Rangers did n't fire coach John Muckler during the early season struggles . <p> ' Because of all the changes we had made , there were people telling me that we could n't really judge the team until the first of the year , and they were prophetic , ' Checketts said . ' But I 'm not sure I can judge this team yet . There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic , but there 's still a lot of work to do . ' <p> Stunning stat of the day : Martin Brodeur already has won 30 games for the Devils this season - thanks to Patrick Elias ' goal with 1.7 seconds left in regulation against the Panthers on Wednesday night . He is 12-0-2 in his last 14 games , and he is the fifth NHL goalie to reach 30 victories five years in a row . <p> ' It all sounds great , ' Brodeur said . ' I 'm just glad the 30 wins are all over with because people are making such a big deal of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 27 . If he gets 15 more victories this season , then plays eight more seasons and averages a ' modest ' 25 victories , that would get him to 446 . He could play longer than that , of course , and perhaps get a lot more victories . In other words , Patrick Roy not only will be trying to break Terry Sawchuck 's record of 447 , but nudge the record high enough to make it tougher for Brodeur to catch him . <p> The Panthers have been one of the surprises this season , and Pavel Bure is lighting it up . But Florida frequently is n't selling out , and the Panthers-Devils game drew only 15,689 on Wednesday night . <p> Canadian-born Bobby Clarke was taking some heat for signing and obtaining Keith Primeau in the trade for Rod Brind'Amour last week . The Flyers signed Primeau , the Carolina holdout , to a five-year , $ 22.5 million contract , and that was viewed as another step in the inflationary spiral that will make it harder to keep teams in the Canadian small markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league , ' Clarke said . ' Keith 's contract is not inflationary . It 's exactly the same as Rod Brind'Amour 's . When Rod is done , he 'll go into unrestricted free agency and he 'll be ( at $ 5 million ) like Keith . We did n't see that as inflationary . Not the way it 's going . ' <p> FACEOFF <p> This just in : League sponsors and officials get a lot of the tickets to NHL and NBA all-star games , significantly lessening the number of tickets available to ' local ' fans . Even season ticket holders in the host city sometime get shut out of the opportunity to buy tickets . <p> For those who consider that surprising or even worthy of a banner headline , here are some other news flashes : Amelia Earhart is missing . ' Citizen Kane ' was really about William Randolph Hearst . Pete Rose bet . <p> The 2001 All-Star Game at the Pepsi Center will be the NHL 's show , and one of the downsides of being the host team is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality : The Avs wo n't be able to make everyone happy , and it 's silly to expect them to . <p> That said , it 's mind-boggling that Ascent did n't have a more specific ticket plan to announce when the NHL confirmed the All-Star Game was headed here next year . Instead , Ascent 's pronouncement seemed to be : ' We 'll think about it so stay tuned . ' <p> It has been obvious for three years that an All-Star Game was headed to Denver - if not in 2001 , then soon after . Has n't Ascent at least been pondering a ticket allotment plan for its season ticket holders ? If not , why not ? <p> The Avs already are battling lawsuits and complaints from fans ( God bless ' em ) who are griping about such things as : a ) federally mandated railings for handicap access at the Pepsi Center ; and b ) parking rates that are typical , if not low , for the NHL and NBA . This could add to the list of the disgruntled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , it came off as if it was trying to pass the buck - and the heat - to the next ownership . <p> There is a slight chance that the high prices of all-star tickets , and the dubious nature of the game itself as a competition , might combine to scare off enough season-ticket holders and make that ' local ' pool enough to handle the requests . <p> Ascent ca n't count on that , though . Even though Ascent is n't likely to own the team next year , that does n't mean its business-side moguls - many of whom presumably would want to remain under the next ownership - should abdicate decision-making responsibilities in the interim . And that 's true , even when the decision-making involves a no-win situation . <p> Face it : There is no way to please all the season-ticket holders . Those who get tickets to the All-Star Game wo n't like their seats - or the cost . Those who are shut out will scream . <p> That 's because it 's the NHL 's game , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The NBA turns its all-star game into even more of a private party , but it does n't draw as much attention for that because , in most cases , the season-ticket bases in NBA-NHL markets are smaller for basketball than for hockey . <p> For the game next year , one ' fair ' way would be to say that every season-ticket account for two or more tickets gets two tickets , period . ( Single ticket accounts get one . ) That way , most - maybe all - season-ticket holders get a shot . But can you hear the screaming about that one from those with four or eight season tickets ? That 's just one illustration that ' fair ' wo n't quiet the criticism . <p> Much of this is the NHL 's fault . The league needs to set a uniform policy and apply it at every All-Star Game . <p> There is a host team and a host city . But it 's the NHL 's game . There 's no use pretending any different . <p> FINAL BUZZER <p> Despite the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ties . The position here long has been every NHL regular-season game should have a definitive outcome , especially with ticket prices skyrocketing , and shootouts should be seriously considered . <p> Here 's another possibility : The NHL should add a 3-pointer . No , it is n't in the tradition of the red , white and blue basketball and longer shots , but involves the standings . <p> Make a win worth three points , a tie only one . The new rules already have removed the sanctity of every game being ' worth ' two points , since games decided in overtime result in three points showing up in the standings . So take that to the next level and provide even more incentive to go for the win - either in regulation or overtime .
