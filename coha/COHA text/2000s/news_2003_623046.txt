<p> It 's not an office building , not live-work lofts . Not a converted warehouse . Not a below-the-radar artists ' colony . Really , the glimmering , new , silver-and-brick-colored , three-story , 43,000-square-foot West Berkeley building with an industrial air is an original development beast . <p> Activspace , as the owners have dubbed it , is a 200-unit beehive of studio space exclusively for artists and craftspeople . Open since January , the building  --  which has no living quarters other than an apartment for the manager  --  is filling up with an unusual mix of novelists , freelance writers , painters , photographers , potters , jewelers , toy makers , fashion designers , bookbinders , soap makers , woodworkers , filmmakers and others who work with their hands for fun or for a living . <p> The super-sized studio complex on Seventh Street is an experiment in a city not known for its fondness for development experiments , but the early word is so far , so good . <p> " We 've been promoting the arts and artisans in West Berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region , " said Michael Caplan , assistant to the city manager . " Berkeley is an obvious location for this thing . Not to mention the fact that Berkeley is filled with artists looking for space . " <p> Developer Denny Abrams , the brawn behind Berkeley 's Fourth Street shopping district , weighed in with this : " The concept is really interesting . It 's beneficial to the community because it provides the kind of spaces that are n't readily available in other buildings . And I think it 's going to be a success so the developers are going to make money . " The building , he said , is " very handsome even though it obviously is cheap and tries to save money . It 's a brilliant design . " <p> The Activspace model is the brainchild of Seattle couple Jude Siddall and Gary Romain who hit on the idea a decade ago . The couple rented outside storage space in Seattle 's funky Fremont neighborhood and realized that their customers wanted more than just storage  --  they wanted a place to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancer who allows only that she 's middle-aged , has a soft spot for artists and an eye for their needs . <p> The first all-workshop building was completed in 1995 , and since then the company ( officially Activspace LLC ) , has erected seven similar buildings in Seattle and Portland . An eighth building is being planned for Boulder , Colo . Rumor has it that the search is on for another Bay Area space , though Siddall would only say that prudent business people are always " looking for opportunities . " <p> " Artists have always found nasty , mucky , shlucky space that no one else wants , " said Siddall . All too often , their arrival heralds a neighborhood 's inexorable transformation and eventually , when the area gentrifies enough , the artists are priced out and have to move on to the next undiscovered spot . <p> " We believed that you do n't have to suffer for your art . You can be more productive when you have heat , light , 24-hour access , " Siddall said . " We think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stay in this building forever . It 's a destination point rather than a transitional environment . " Inevitably , when a large number of creative types move into one building , a dynamic community forms , she said . <p> The Berkeley studios  --  which are equipped with windows , sinks , heat , light , power and Internet access  --  range from walk-in closet to living room size . The spaces are not formally finished  --  renters are encouraged to personalize them as they wish as long as they bring the room back to a neutral shell when they leave . The smallest spaces cost $175 , the largest more than $1,000 . The leases are month-to-month , though renters must stay for six months to get their full deposit returned . <p> A great deal more artists studios have become available in the East Bay in the past two years , said Larry Mathews , coordinator of ArtHouse in Oakland , a nonprofit that finds space for artists . But despite the change in the real estate market , the Activspace studios are filling up at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units have been leased , but architect Kava Massih estimated that more than half have been rented , and a walk-through on a recent afternoon bore that out . Berkeley zoning regulations require that small businesses in the building be of the soap- and candle-making variety . Straight retail or office use is forbidden . <p> Tim Cleves , 35 , who creates copper , hand-bound journals and photo albums from one of the small but sweet second floor studios , is a typical renter . He wanted to get his copper book business off his kitchen table and off the ground but was hesitant to sign a long-term or expensive lease . Instead , he pays $290 for his 9-by-14-foot space . ( The smallest spaces , such as Cleves ' , have been snatched up the fastest , Massih said . ) <p> " If it all goes horribly wrong in four months time , I 'm not tied in , " said Cleves , who works with his door open and has been swapping tips with another bookbinder on the ground floor . <p> With his own space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have to worry about his 20-month-old baby wandering through or having to clean up in time for dinner . " When I work at home , there 's too many distractions , " he said . <p> Painter Yvonne Muinde spent two months looking for a space to complete a mural she was commissioned to make for an African American research library in Denver . Given the change in the rental market , " I thought this should be easy , " she said . " But I was n't finding too much out there . The whole Bay Area is looking for spaces . " <p> She pays $1,100 for her approximately 300-square-foot space  --  not exactly a bargain , she said . " I had seen some bigger spaces for less money , but they also had a long list of people waiting . . . . This was easy to get , a quick process . " She just completed the mural and plans to move into a smaller , cheaper space next door . <p> Though it 's early to detect the affect on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That impact will be enhanced when the nonprofit Affordable Housing Associates completes its West Berkeley project  --  51 units of affordable live-work space for artists at Ashby and Heinz avenues . <p> From a financial point of view , Activspace is a cunning idea . The interior spaces are left fairly raw  --  plywood floors and unpainted walls  --  which reduces the price of construction . " The interiors do n't have the fancy finishes . That 's not what people are after . They want to make a mess and not worry about hurting something , " Massih said . " If you do n't have to spend money on finishes , you 're that much ahead . " <p> Furthermore , because the occupants are coming and going at odd hours  --  while some work typical 9-to-5 hours , others squeeze in visits before or after work  --  the building does n't require as much parking . That adds up to more room to build , more space to rent . And though the smallest studios are affordable , the price per square foot is relatively high . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , because the rate is not uniform  --  but anyone can do the math . ) <p> No imitators have yet emerged . Whether Activspace-style buildings will be the next building craze or developers will consider transforming the area 's reams of empty office space into dens of creativity remains to be seen . But a lot of people are waiting and watching . <p> " It depends on how successful this one is . It took a while . If they develop momentum , maybe it 's something that can provide basis for doing it in other places , " said Mark Rhoades , Berkeley 's planning manager . <p> " I 'm encouraged by it , " said Larry Mathewsof ArtHouse . . " It 's also exciting when artist do it themselves , and we 're seeing more and more of that . <p> " Groups of artists are taking advantage of the real estate situation . Landlords are getting more desperate . They 're willing to talk to artists , whereas in the past they might have seen them as flaky and unreliable tenants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you 'll see more and more of these types of arrangements .
