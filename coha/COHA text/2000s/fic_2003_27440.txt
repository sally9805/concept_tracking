The clan of Sawney Rath could feel their fortunes changing , much for the better . Grissoul had predicted it would be thus , and the vixen was seldom wrong . Only that day the clan foragers had caught a huge load of mackerel that had strayed into the shallows of the incoming tide . Fires blazed in the scrubland beyond the dunes that evening , as the fish , skewered on green withes , blistered and popped over the flames . Sawney was not as big as other ferrets , but he was faster , smarter and far more savage than any stoat , rat , weasel , fox or ferret among his followers . Anybeast could lay claim to the clan leadership , providing they could defeat Sawney in combat , but for a long time none had dared to . Sawney Rath could fight with a ferocity that was unequaled , and he never spared the vanquished challengers . Sawney 's clan were nomads , sixty all told , thieves , vagrants , vagabonds and tricksters who would murder and plunder without hesitation . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , woodlands and byways , but they never formed a united force , each choosing to go its own way under a strong Chieftain . This leader always tacked his name on to the Juska title , so that Sawney 's clan came to be known as the Juskarath . Though they were little more than dry-land pirates , Juska vermin had quite a strict code of conduct , which was governed by seers , omens and superstition . Sawney sat beneath the awning of his tent , sipping a vile-tasting medication that his seer Grissoul had concocted to ease the stomach pains that constantly dogged him . He watched the clan , noting their free and easy mood . Sawney smiled as some of the rats struck up a song . Rats were easily pleased ; once they had a full stomach and a flagon of nettle beer they would either sing or sleep . Sawney was only half watching the rats , his real attention focused upon the stoat Antigra . She lay nursing her newborn , a son called Zann . Sawney could tell Antigra was feigning slumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was not looking . Sawney Rath 's eyes missed very little of what went on around him . He pulled a face of disgust as he sniffed the mixture of feverfew and treacle mustard in the cup he held , and , spitting into the fire , he muttered the newborn stoatbabe 's name . " Hah , Zann ! " Grissoul the Seer stole up out of the gathering darkness and placed a steaming plate of food by his side . He glanced up at the vixen . She was an odd-looking fox , even for a seer . She wore a barkcloth cloak that she had covered in red and black symbols , and her brow , neck and limbs were almost invisible under bracelets of coral , brass and silver . About her waist she wore a belt from which hung a broad pouch and bones of all kinds . One of her eyes was never still . Sawney tipped the plate with his footpaw . " Am I supposed to eat this mess ? " She smiled coaxingly . " Yar , ' t is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dock . Thy stomach 'll favor it ! " The ferret drew from his belt a lethally beautiful knife , straight-bladed , razor sharp , with a brilliant blue sapphire set into its amber handle . Delicately he picked up a morsel of fish on the knife point , and tasted it . " This is good . I like it ! " Grissoul sat down beside him . " None can cook for thee like I. " She watched him eating awhile before speaking again . " Th'art going to ask me about the Taggerung , I feel it . " Sawney picked a sliver of fish from between his teeth . " Aye . Have there been any more signs of the Taggerung ? " Antigra interrupted by leaping up and thrusting her baby forward at them . " Fools ! " she shouted defiantly . " Ca n't you see , my Zann is the Taggerung ! " The entire camp fell silent . Creatures turned away from their cooking fires to see what would happen . Sawney stood up , one paw holding his stomach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were not a mother nursing a babe you would be dead where you stand . Nobeast calls Sawney Rath a fool ! " Antigra was shaking with rage . The baby stoat had set up a thin wail , but her voice drowned it out . " I demand you recognize my son as Taggerung ! " Sawney gritted his teeth . Thrusting the dagger back into his belt he turned aside , snarling at Grissoul . " Tell that stoat why her brat can not be called Taggerung ! " Grissoul stood between them , facing Antigra , and took a starling 's skull , threaded on thin twine , from her belt . She swung it in a figure of eight until the air rushing through the eye and beak sockets made a shrieking whistle . " Hearken , Antigra , even a long-dead bird can mock thee . Shout all thou like , ' twill not make thine offspring grow to be the Taggerung . You it is who are a fool ! Can thou not see the omens are all wrong ? Even though you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be the chosenbeast . I see all . Grissoul knows , take thou my word now . Go back to your fire and nurse the babe , and be silent , both of ye ! " Antigra held the newborn stoat up high , shaking the babe until it wailed even more loudly . " Never ! " she cried . Sawney winced as his stomach gave a sharp twinge . He turned upon the stoat mother , roaring dangerously , " Enough ! You have heard my Seer : the omens are wrong . Zann can never be called Taggerung . Unless you want to challenge me for the leadership of the clan and change the Juskarath law to suit yourself , I command you to silence your scolding tongue and speak no more of the matter ! " He turned and went into his tent , but Antigra was not prepared to let the matter lie . Everybeast heard her shout after him : " Then you are challenged , Sawney Rath ! " His stomach pains immediately forgotten , the ferret Chieftain emerged from the tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen that look before turned away . Only Antigra faced him as he asked quietly , " So , who challenges me ? " He saw the creature , even before Antigra replied , " Gruven , the father of Zann ! " Gruven stepped forth from the shadows . In one hefty paw he carried a small round shield , in the other a tall slim spear , its point shining in the firelight . He struck a fighting stance , his voice loud and clear . " I challenge you , Sawney Rath . Arm yourself and face me ! " Sawney had always liked Gruven . He was a valuable asset to the clan . Big , strong , but not too intelligent . Sawney shook his head and smiled patronizingly . " Do n't do it , Gruven . Do n't listen to your mate . Put the spear and shield down ; live to see your son grow up . " Antigra whispered something to Gruven that seemed to embolden him . He circled away from her , jabbing the spear in Sawney 's direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taggerung . Now fight like a Juska , or die like a coward ! " Sawney shrugged off the insult . " As you wish . " He turned , as if to fetch his weapons from the tent , then half swung back , as though he had forgotten to say something to the challenger . " Oh , er , Gruven . . . " There was a deadly whirr as the knife left Sawney 's paw . Gruven coughed slightly , a puzzled look on his face , then fell backward , the blade buried in his throat up to its decorative handle . Sawney finished what he had been saying . " Do n't ever hold your shield low like that , it 's a fatal mistake . Grissoul , I 'll see you in my tent . " Ignoring Antigra 's wails , Sawney beckoned the vixen to sit beside him . " What have you seen ? " Grissoul emptied her bag of stones , shells and bones on the ground , nodding sagely . " See thou , my omens have fallen the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is born at last . There are other Juska clans abroad in the land , and any of these would deem it a great honor to count him as one of them . Such a beast is a talisman of great power . The Taggerung can change the fortunes of a clan . Nobeast is mightier ; none can stand before a Taggerung . Long seasons have passed since such a warrior lived . Who would know this better than thee , Sawney , for was not thine own father the chosen one ? Ah , those were glorious days . Our clan was the largest and most feared then . Everybeast had to bow their heads to your father . Zann Juskarath Taggerung ! Can you not remember the respect he commanded wherever we went- " Sawney cut the Seer off impatiently . " Cease your prattle about my father . I know how great he was , but he 's long dead and gone . Tell me more of this new Taggerung . How do you know he 's born , and where do we find him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had picked earlier that day . It was pale pink , with three fat petals and one thinner than the others . She smiled slyly . " My visions tell me a mark shaped like this little blossom will be upon him , or maybe her , for who can tell if Taggerung be male or female ? " Just then a weasel called Eefera entered and gave Sawney his knife back , cleaned of blood traces . Sawney dismissed Eefera and placed the blade lightly against the Seer 's nose . " You said any clan would deem it an honor to count him as one of them . The Taggerung will be a male creature . Stop playing your little games and get on with it ! " Grissoul turned the knifeblade aside with one paw . " He will have the speedwell mark on him , where I know not . See thou these two bones , fallen next to each other , with this shell across the ends of both ? That means a river , or a stream , and the shell is for a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream . Do thou see it also ? " Sawney nodded . " That means a ford . The long path from north to south has such a ford , where the stream crosses it in Mossflower country , a good five-day march from here . " Grissoul closed her eyes , swaying back and forth . " Today I saw a hawk strike a dove in the air . Their cries mingled , and they gave out together a bell-like sound . " Sawney gave a start . " You mean the old Abbey of Redwall ! That 's the only place that gives out bell sounds in all that region ! " The Seer kept her eyes shut . " Methinks that would be it . " Sawney grabbed Grissoul 's shoulder so tightly that her eyes popped open . He pulled her close , his voice like a rasp . " Speak not to me of Redwall . I would not go within a mile of it . I have listened to the talk around the campfires since I was nought but a whelp . The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestured dramatically . " I am not stupid . The history of Redwall Abbey has taught me a lesson . I know how many warlords and conquerors , with vast hordes and mighty armies to back them , have been defeated by the woodlanders who dwell behind those walls . Even in the seasons long before our great-grandsires ' ancestors were born . You 've heard their names , everybeast has . Cluny the Scourge , Slagar the Cruel , Ferahgo the Assassin , and many others . All of them defeated and slain . But I 'll tell you one name that wo n't be added to the list . Sawney Rath , Chieftain of the Juskarath ! " Grissoul spoke soothingly to calm Sawney 's rising ire . " Nay , fret thou not . The bell sound omen is a warning , telling thee not to go near yon red Abbey . Beware the sound of the bell ! " Sawney spat neatly into the fire . " Hah ! I already knew that . I 'm as wise as any omen . Just tell me what part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her paraphernalia and cast them a second time . She stared at them , then pointed . " See thou those bones that fell foursquare with that red piece of stone at their center ? Watch ! " She lifted the red stone slightly , and an ant crawled from beneath it and ran over the bones . The Seer smiled triumphantly . " It means that the Taggerung will be a creature from the Abbey ! " Sawney placed a paw on the ground , and the ant ran onto it . The ferret held the paw close to his eyes , watching the insect circling a claw . " What manner of creature will it be ? " Grissoul pursed her lips . " Who can tell ? " She inspected the pawprint Sawney had left in the sandy ground . " Five days from here , at the ford where waters cross the path . Then will thou see what sort of beast the Taggerung will be . " Sawney stood up and patted his stomach . " I feel better . Tell them to break camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my clan will be the greatest of honors . My Juskarath will make the journey in four days . I want to be there early , in case other clan Seers have had visions . I 'll slay anybeast who comes near that ford . Tell the clan to hasten or I 'll leave them behind . . . aye , the same way I 'm leaving Gruven here . " Grissoul stared at him , almost fondly . " Th'art a wise Chieftain , and ruthless too ! " Sawney checked her as she went . " One other thing . Once we have the Taggerung we travel back this way fast , to the sea and shores . Nobeast at Redwall must know ' t was my clan that took him . If the tales about them are true , they must be fearsome warriors , with a long paw for vengeance . I need to avoid a conflict with such beasts . " He waved a paw , dismissing his Seer . As he did so , the ant was hurled from its perch and fell into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the ant swam !
