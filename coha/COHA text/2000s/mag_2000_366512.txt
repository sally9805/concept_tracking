Javier Francisco Ovando is famous today , but back in 1996 no one much cared when cops stormed his apartment near downtown Los Angeles and shot him in the chest and head . Ovando belonged to the 18th Street Gang , a group of powerful Mexican drug lords . At trial , the judge lectured the skinny 19-year-old  --  who lay paralyzed on a gurney  --  for threatening the lives of two brave cops , and sent him away for 23 years . <P> It was a classic cops-and-robbers tale , but with a film-noir twist . Ovando was railroaded by the police , who had planted a gun to get the conviction . But no one believed Ovando until a dishonest cop , Rafael Perez , talked . Faced with 14 years in prison for stealing cocaine from a police lockup , Perez opted to bargain for a lighter sentence by delivering up his fellow officers . That was five months ago , and Perez has hardly stopped talking since . He has filled 2,000 transcript pages with accounts of cops faking evidence , testifying against innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always been a strong suspicion in popular culture  --  think Chinatown or L.A. Confidential  --  that Los Angeles cops were quietly up to no good , and there have been some dark real-life incidents , like the police beating of Rodney King . But L.A. is embroiled in its biggest police scandal ever , one that makes Joseph Wambaugh read like tepid tea . Authorities have identified 40 people who were wrongly convicted , and public defenders are reviewing 4,000 more cases . The cops " are just a gang with the law on their side , " says Gerardo ( " Clever " ) Lopez , a former gang member . " People are finally seeing the truth . " <P> At the heart of the scandal is the Rampart division 's Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums , or CRASH . Perez is reportedly claiming that 70 to 80 members of this antigang unit were " in the loop , " that is , acting a lot like gang members . Among their rituals : decorating their bodies with tattoos of grinning skulls and awarding themselves gruesome plaques for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Los Angeles Times and Daily News for days , are a stunning indictment : cops who shot suspects and then delayed calling an ambulance , so they could fix the scene to make the shooting look justified ; cops who stole drugs and sold them on the street ; cops partying with  --  and sometimes raping  --  informants ; and cops who shot at suspects for sport . One of the Rampart 's least distinguished alumni : former officer David Mack , convicted of robbing a bank . <P> But perhaps nothing Perez has owned up to is as disturbing as the degree to which fabricating incriminating evidence seems to have been part of Rampart 's routine . The L.A.P.D. has sent 50 investigators to every prison in the state  --  and as far as South America  --  to track down those framed . But so far L.A.P.D. Chief Bernard Parks has asked for charges to be filed against only three officers , insisting Perez 's claim of 70 officers involved is too high . ( Eleven officers are on leave . ) A police board of inquiry is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for police applicants , and sting operations to make sure they stay clean .
