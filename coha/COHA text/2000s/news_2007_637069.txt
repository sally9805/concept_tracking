<p> You 've surfed the Internet , studied back copies of Consumer Reports and kicked dozens of tires . Finally , a shiny new car is in the driveway . Now you just have to keep it there . <p> More than 1.2 million cars and trucks were stolen in 2005 , according to the National Crime Information Center . That 's about two a minute . The estimated value of the losses is $7.6 billion , says the National Insurance Crime Bureau . <p> Any car can be stolen if the thief is determined enough , says Gwinnett County Police Sgt. Jim Price . But a car owner can do a lot to make it more difficult  --  and more time consuming  --  to boot . <p> " The longer it takes for a thief to get your car , the less interested he is in it , " says Price , who for six years worked in the auto theft investigations unit and now trains other officers in auto theft investigation methods . <p> While car owners this year will spend an estimated $250 million on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Price say carmakers are building in more security . <p> " Ignition systems are more advanced , " says Price . " They 're not as easy to defeat . " <p> Security systems that include immobilizer systems that kill the engine , or prevent it from starting in the first place , are standard equipment in some luxury cars , notes Steve Koenig , a senior analyst with the Consumer Electronics Association . <p> Any system , of course , can be beaten , so the National Insurance Crime Bureau recommends layers of security , ranging from common sense precautions such as locking your doors to installation of GPS tracking devices to aid in recovery of a stolen car . <p> The old-fashioned blaring car alarm is of dubious benefit , experts say . <p> False alarms are such a common annoyance that every alarm , no matter how loud , is ignored , says Ivan Blackman of National Insurance Crime Bureau . <p> The usefulness of an audible alarm depends on where you live , says Price . <p> If you live in an apartment complex , Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's a nuisance . " But if you live in a quiet subdivision , it may get the neighbors to turn on their floodlights and take a peek outside . <p> Quieter deterrents than an alarm include mechanical locks that fit on the steering wheel , tire or steering column . <p> A steering wheel lock  --  one well-known brand is called the Club  --  " stops the very naive , young thief , " says Blackman , who instead suggests an armored collar that fits around the steering column . <p> " Armored collars are easy to install and hard to get off , " Blackman says . <p> Some car thieves , says Price of the Gwinnett police , simply tow the targeted car away to their den of iniquity . <p> When you walk out and the car is gone  --  despite your best efforts  --  is when a variety of tracking devices come into play . <p> Blackman says GPS systems that alert you when the car is moved beyond a set distance are dropping in price , making " geofencing " a good option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system market , makes a system that sends a signal to your key fob when your car is on the move . It can also send a message to an e-mail address or telephone number . <p> The system , which sells for $419 to $659 , " allows you to find your car on an Internet map , " says company spokesman Ken Gammage . <p> Not only can you help police locate your stolen car , you can use the system to see if your teen really went to the library when he borrowed your car . <p> The OnStar system , a GPS-based navigation and communication system in many General Motors vehicles , is frequently used to track down a stolen car or pickup truck . GM gets about 400 requests a month from law enforcement , a company spokeswoman said . <p> But the process to start tracking the car down can be cumbersome , says Price . The owner must file a police report before OnStar will release information to the police . <p> The tracking system is also fairly easily disabled by an experienced thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by GM , Price says . <p> " We do catch people with stolen cars with OnStar because if criminals were smart , we would n't have a job , " Price says . <p> Price says LoJack is the most effective car recovery tracking system . With LoJack , the signal from the transmitter hidden in the car is picked up by specially equipped police cars . <p> When you file a stolen vehicle report , police computers send a silent wireless signal to your car , automatically activating the hidden LoJack transmitter . <p> One problem with LoJack , Price says , is that coverage is limited . <p> The land-based antenna system provides coverage in 26 states , says Bill Burruss of LoJack . <p> The system , which works on an FM radio signal , covers about 80 counties in Georgia , more than 6,500 square miles , Burruss says . <p> LoJack sells for $695 , but there is no monthly service charge . When you sell the car , the LoJack goes with it , Burruss said . <p> Lexus GS 430 ( MSRP $52,375 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under six seconds thanks to a 290-horsepower , 4.3-liter V-8 engine coupled with a six-speed automatic transmission . Leather and wood grace the cabin , and the optional Mark Levinson sound system will make your spirit soar . Keep it to yourself with vehicle theft deterrent system and engine immobilizer . <p> Subaru B9 Tribeca ( MSRP $29,995- $37,295 )  --  The list of standard equipment for this midsize crossover utility vehicle includes a security system with engine immobilizer . The engine it wo n't let a thief start is a 245-horspower , 3-liter six cylinder . The B9 Tribeca has all-wheel drive , front-seat side air bags and full-length side curtain air bags . <p> Lincoln MKZ ( MSRP $29,235-$31,105 )  --  Standard features include leather seating , power seats with memory , dual-zone automatic climate control and an active anti-theft perimeter alarm to keep it all safe .
