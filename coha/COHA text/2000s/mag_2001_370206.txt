BARBIE GROWS UP Often a search for the coolest design ends with the simplest . Witness the iBook , Apple 's consumer-priced laptop , which underwent a profound and much lauded transformation last week . Intended as a kind of portable iMac , the two-year-old iBook started life as a bulky , gaudy rubberized clamshell that barely fit into backpacks , with a carry-case plastic handle and choice of colors that critics  --  yours truly included  --  derided as " Barbie-like . " <P> No plastic dolls were in attendance last week when Steve Jobs showed off the iBook 's smaller , wiser exterior on Apple 's Cupertino , Calif. , campus . After the runaway success of his superslim titanium G4 Powerbook , it seems Jobs has finally figured out what the public wants in a laptop computer . The new iBook looks and feels very much like a titanium Powerbook that went through a compactor and got drenched in milky-white plastic . This is not a bad thing . The newcomer is 1.3 in. thick  --  a mere 0.3 in. deeper than the titanium model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can almost hide it under an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper ) . Its keyboard is still full-size , however , and the plastic-rubbery covering should scratch and stain even less than titanium . <P> Best of all , iBook will save you around 2,000 big ones . Running from $1,299 for bare bones to $1,799 for a version that plays DVDs and burns CDs , it wo n't break the bank like a $2,599 to $3,997 titanium model . Did Apple make sacrifices for that price ? Sure . The screen is only 12 in. , though it has excellent resolution . And you have to put CDs on a tray rather than slot them in like bread in a toaster . <P> Otherwise , the new iBook is golden . Its standard 500 MHz chip is speedy enough for all consumer needs , and the FireWire port means you can even download and edit your digital home movies away from home . Jobs is pushing this as the best portable choice for education , but it looks suspiciously like the laptop for the rest of us too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
