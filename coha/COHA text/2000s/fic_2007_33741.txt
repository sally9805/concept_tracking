Chapter One NEW YORK CITY September 8 Laurel Kingsford flinched when the door of her office banged open and Jerry Garcone cruised in . The wisp of concept she 'd flirted with all morning , the breakthrough solution to one of the most difficult problems her design team faced , disappeared from her mind . She 'd been Jerry 's mentor in the firm since he came aboard three years earlier . He should know better than to barge in like this by now . " Sorry to disturb you , IQ , but Nick wants to see you in his office ASAP . Want me to tell him you 'll be up after you powder your nose ? " IQ again . The nickname had settled on her because she was so bright , the guys in the management clique said , but one of the other women on staff had whispered the truth . It stood for " Ice Queen . " " No , I 'll be along as soon as I can save my work and shut down the system . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was in New York to build a career , not catch a husband , and she turned down social invitations from male employees , Jerry among them . The nickname had been her reward , and it stuck-even after she and Rob became engaged . Jerry maintained a friendly manner in her presence , but he was too ambitious for his own good . No way would she trust him alone with Nick if she could help it , not when everyone expectedthe new head of the fuel cell project to be named in the next few days . Tom Everett , retired project head , had recommended her as his replacement and rightly so . She had the qualifications : six years in fuel cell engineering , two as team leader , several summers of deep-sea research with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at Woods Hole , and a love of everything nautical . She planned her summer vacations around one NOAA field project or another , and they always invited her back . The job was hers . She was comfortable with that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her breathing accelerated . Could this be it , the formal announcement ? Jerry peered over her shoulder at her screen . She glared and he stepped back . " Okay , see you up there . " He did n't bother to close the door when he left . * * * Five minutes later , Laurel left the elevator on the twenty-fifth floor and entered the reception area outside Nick 's office . For the past weeks , she 'd taken care to dress more formally , to be ready , if and when the announcement came . Today 's suit set off her eyes , and did n't disguise the fact that she was young and trim , even if in her own mind she was too tall , and her figure less than eye-popping . Nick 's receptionist smiled . " Go on in , Laurel , they 're all there . " All ? With a sudden sense of foreboding , Laurel entered the division head 's office . Opposite the entrance , a bank of windows extended from knee height to the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick Zaia 's desk dominated the center of the room and he stood when she entered . Marianne , Laurel 's friend and head of the Propulsion Project , was present too , and so was Jerry Garcone . Jerry wore a suit she had n't seen before , of very good cloth . She had n't noticed downstairs . He wore it well , along with a huge grin . Beside him , Marianne did not look happy . Her eyes flashed a warning . " Ms. Kingsford . Good . Come in , please . " Laurel 's sensors went to full alert . Nick always called her by her nickname . He came around the desk and offered his hand . He was tall and fair-skinned , with curly black hair and wide blue eyes . His outward demeanor was open as they shook hands . Nick went to the windows , where he looked out for several seconds . Then he moved back behind his desk . He did n't sit , or invite anyone else to . " I did n't expect you to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're here , you might as well hear it from me . " He shuffled papers on his desk while he shifted from foot to foot then looked up at her . " I 've just accepted Marianne 's resignation as Propulsion Project manager ... " His eyes were unreadable as they bored into Laurel 's . When she did not react , he went on . " We 've named Jerry Garcone to replace Tom Everett as head of the fuel cell project . Management decided a fresh approach , a new attitude , would be good for the department . " Laurel was struck mute . They could n't leapfrog Jerry over her . She was senior on the design team , practically carrying the whole project on her shoulders . Jerry did n't have a prayer of handling the job . Had Marianne quit over the news ? Until now , she 'd been the only woman in a leadership position in the company , and Laurel 's strongest ally . " But ... I thought ... " she tried , but the words would n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Tom recommended you to replace him , hon , but we felt the program would be more stable with a ... with Jerry 's hand on the tiller . " He stepped around to her , seemed genuinely sorry to have to deliver the news , and placed his hand on her shoulder . " You 're a great asset for us . I just hope you can see your way to working under Jerry . We need you to keep producing the same high-quality work you have all along . " The truth came with his choice of words , the way he 'd been about to say " a man 's hand on the tiller . " A heat began in Laurel 's neck and rose upward over her face . Marianne out . The ally she 'd counted on . It was all lost . How could she face the other team members , the other female employees ? She trembled , shook his hand from her shoulder and stalked out the door , her body stiff and shuddering . " Laurel , wait ! " Marianne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to her floor , Laurel fought back tears only until she reached her office . When the door closed behind her , the dam burst and tears flowed so thick she stopped trying to wipe them away . Tears of indignation , not sorrow ; resentment , not remorse . She booted her computer . She might cry when things like this happened , but she could still function . They would n't get the innovations she 'd conceived for the fuel cell , the ones she 'd anticipated being asked to develop . Technically , they might be the property of Forrester NA , but they could hardly prosecute her for stealing something they had no idea existed . When the system was up , she tapped in her code words and stuck a CD in the drive . Two minutes later she 'd burned the contents of her personal files into the disk . She pulled up the operating system and typed in the instruction , " FORMAT C : " . After assuring the mainframe that she really , really wanted to reformat her hard drive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , she typed the final " Y " and waited as the routine got under way . Ten minutes later , her hard drive was fresh as a newborn baby . Deleted files ? What deleted files ? Just in time too . Moments after she removed the CD , her system went off and the screen went black . The bastards were making sure she did n't do anything irrational while she was angry , like quit and take work papers with her , exactly as she 'd just done . Let that bushwhacker Jerry Garcone stew in his own salsa . All she could think of was getting out of there and getting home to Rob . Rob would know how to help . He would comfort her . She pulled the liner from her wastebasket and emptied its contents on the floor , then cleaned out her desk . When she finished , she pulled her keys , employee ID , parking passes , and even her unused lunch tickets from her purse and threw them on their desk . She 'd given this company the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because it was a way to make a living . It was much more , a demonstration to them , as well as to herself , of her value as a person . It was exactly eleven forty-five when she left her office , carrying a half-filled trash bag and the disk containing solutions to problems her design team did n't know it had yet . Not much to show for six years of hard work , hopes , and dreams . She ignored the stares that escorted her to the exit . There would be other jobs . She 'd quit without notice , so there 'd be no money other than the refund of the retirement contributions she 'd made , but they would manage . * * * Laurel turned the key and pushed the apartment door open . " Hello ! Robbie . I 'm home early , " she called as she entered the hall . Rob had been busy today . He 'd finally picked up the half dozen pairs of footgear he usually kicked off and then abandoned in the entryway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plastic bag of belongings on the table . " Are you home , honey ? I 've got news . " Well , maybe he had n't been so busy after all . The breakfast dishes were still piled in the sink . Maybe he 'd gone out job hunting . That would be good news . She entered the living room , on the way to the bedroom and the first wrong note sounded . The home entertainment center , which included TV , VCR , stereo , CD player and tape deck , was missing . Her hand went to her throat and a chill spread . " Rob ! Rob ! Are you all right ? " She whirled a complete circle . Looking for what ? An intruder ? She ran into the bedroom . " My God ! " The drawers of Rob 's dresser were on the floor , empty . On the vanity , her jewelry box was open . She went to it and quickly pawed through . She did n't have much of value . She sighed with relief . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd jotted her access codes and passwords in-the computers at work , the cable company . She 'd probably neglected to put it back last time she retrieved a forgotten password . A needle of dread lanced her , stealing her breath . She had put it back , she remembered clearly , after recording the codes to access her accounts on line , the ones the bank had just set up two weeks ago . She reached over and booted her computer . In less than a minute she had her accounts on the screen . The funds from her savings account had been moved to her checking account ten days ago . The day after that , a check for virtually her entire balance had been paid to the account of someone named Andrew Pierce . She sat on the unmade bed . The sheets were cold , unwelcoming . Her mind reached for understanding . Rob 's closet was empty . Everything of his , his guitars , his hobby kits , everything was gone . He 'd betrayed her . She sobbed and fell backward onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transaction . The money would be gone . He 'd left her nothing , not even a note to say , " I 'm sorry . " THE TWICE TOLD HOTEL MEXICO POINT Southeastern End of Lake Ontario Those whom God wants to punish for the sin of selfishness , he first makes lonely then curses with long life . Jake Eastland , six generations removed from his Revolutionary War ancestor Joshua , knew from bitter experience how empty such an existence could be . At ninety-three , alive but seeing no reason whatever to be happy about it , he frowned as the arrival of the hotel elevator disturbed his reverie . A moment later the doors opened and Sheik Carroway , longtime manager of the hotel marina and sometime friend , stepped out into the vestibule of Jake 's penthouse apartment . Sheik waved a registration card . " The desk asked me to bring this up . Only one new guest today , Jake . A young woman . They put her on the second floor . " With a dismissive movement of his fingers , Jake indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Labor Day and he did n't much care . A year earlier , at his villa in the Swiss Alps , death had handed him its calling card in the form of a cerebral event . After seventy years out in the world , he had n't come back to revamp the hotel 's business plan . He 'd come home to die . But Death refused to cooperate . Time dragged on . He imagined himself suspended in a kind of living purgatory from which he could not escape until life had exacted retribution for his many failures and misdeeds . One year would not be nearly enough . Sheik , a robust man in his sixties , with a shock of white hair and watery blue eyes , dropped the card on the end table beside Jake 's chair and crossed the room to the expensive exercise bike near the windows . " The log still says 614 . You do your exercise today ? " " Promise me it 'll kill me . I 'll ride till I drop . Otherwise , tell me again why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair opposite Jake . " Come on , Jake . Do n't talk like that . You 're lucky . You get around good , you still got all your marbles , and you 're rich as Croeseus . What more do you expect ? Hard-ons ? " Jake 's mood lightened . He had to suppress a smile . " I own Croeseus . Got him in a trade with the Rogala boys in 1945 . Money is n't everything , bub . " " Maybe , but when you do n't have any , like me , it 's a hell of a long way aheada ' whatever comes second . " Sheik threw a worried glance Jake 's way . " You 're down again . You been takin ' the happy pills doc gave you ? He 's gon na be here again tomorrow , you know . He 'll be pissed if you ai n't . That means he 'll yell at me , not you . " Jake made a face . He 'd thrown out the pills . Nothing to live for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another . He motioned in the direction of the lake . " Any nibbles on the Whaler ? " He 'd amused himself by selling off his personal toys . Only the twenty-two-foot Boston Whaler remained . Sheik nodded . " Oh yeah . Almost forgot . Guy offered twenty-nine for it . I told him I 'd talk to you . It 's ten thousand under the market , Jake . Three years ago you put twenty-five into new engines alone . " " Tell him I 'll think it over . " Sheik braced his hands on his knees and pushed himself to his feet . " Okay , Jake . I got ta get back downstairs . Do n't forget to ride the bike . Five miles a day . Keep your ticker runnin ' good . " Jake let his gaze rest on the instrument of torture Sheik referred to . Its handlebars obstructed the view from where he sat . He made as if to rise . " Okay . Maybe I 'll take myself for a spin right now . " Sheik 's expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he went to the elevator without comment . The moment the doors closed , Jake fell back into the armchair , eyeing the remote control of the TV . The numbness of having nothing to do but waste himself watching television came over him , just as it did every day . Eventually , from desperation he 'd turn the thing on . But not yet . The blue of the registration card caught his eye . Reaching , he scooted it closer and flipped it over . Adjusting his glasses so he could see through the reading lens , he held the card to the light . On the first line , the guest had printed her name : Laurel A. Kingsford . Jake 's heart took off on a run of extra beats and his hand trembled so violently the card slipped from his fingers . Laurel . It could n't be that Laurel . It just could n't be . * * * Ten hours later , at nearly three in the morning , Jake had yet to sleep . Outside , wind swayed the trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them onto the ceiling of his bedroom , adding to his wakefulness . Beneath his fingers on the rumpled bed lay the blue registration card of Laurel A. Kingsford . His only living heir . His granddaughter . She thought he was dead . Not surprising , considering that after her mother died and her grandmother took custody , the poor kid spent her formative years tucked away at one boarding school or the other . Hard to learn much about your family when you 're only allowed to visit on holidays and vacations . By then , he and her grandmother Jean Gamble had been divorced thirty years , and Jean had been through a string of other husbands . Jake 's chest ached as remembrance , amplified by the shadows fretting on the ceiling , overrode his effort to suppress it . From the very day his daughter Saundra came into the world , he 'd been pushed to the outside of her life . After the divorce from Jean Gamble , she 'd vowed that so far as Saundra was concerned , Jake no longer existed . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She countered his court orders with her own , fought him to a legal standstill , turned away every attempt he made to visit as the girl came up , all the while filling the child 's mind with poison . He 'd vowed it would be different with Laurel , but business intervened like it always did . He let things slip , and Jean pulled the same tricks she 'd done with Saundra all over again with Laurel . Before long , he 'd lost his chance with his granddaughter too . (
