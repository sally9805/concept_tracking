When lack Cover created his stun gun in the 1970s , he dubbed it " TASER " as an acronym for " Thomas A. Swift and his Electric Rifle . " The fictional characters from our youth tend to loom larger than any others , which is only natural considering the nature of young imaginations .

" Tom looked down to see the smoldering ash that had fallen from the bowl of his bong . Just as his best friend warned him , it had come to rest in the lap of his baggy shorts . " Aw , man !

" Bummer , dude , " his chum said . " Did you lose any water ? " " Naw . Water 's cool . just got ta reload , that 's all . " Tom Swift III reached down to the glass coffee table , where a small heap of seedless sinsemilla lay on top of the current issue of Scientific American . Tom hated having ruined another pair of shorts , but he hated even more wasting good herb . But he had taken too big of a toke from that last bowl , and it had caused him to cough into the bong . Next time , he would have to be more careful . " Wan na see what else is on the tube ? " " Uh ... sure . Hold on . " junior Bud glanced around the spacious living room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end tables , until he found the remote lying on the armrest of his chair next to his elbow . He picked it up and pointed it at the 72-inch flat-screen TV hanging from the wall . It was showing a PBS documentary . about Mars . " Boring , " he said , and started channel-surfing . " So where 's your o1 " man , dude ? " " Somewhere in Egypt , " Tom said distantly as he stuffed a pinch of dope into the bong 's small wooden bowl . " Doing archeology stuff , I du n no . " This was an untruth , for Tom knew that his father , the famed inventor Tom Swift , Jr. , had flown the Flying Lab out to Redmond , Washington , to play golf with Bill Gates . But that was major uncool . " Where 's your oll man ? " " With your ol " man , I guess .

" Think he 'll ask you if you got a job yet when he gets home ? " " I 'm working on it . " Tom located the lighter , flicked it to life . " Went to the mall , filled out some aps . I might get a call from Radio Shack . The manager recognized my name . " " If he calls back , are you going to take the job ? " Junior Bud was still playing with the remote , clicking from one channel to another in two  --  second intervals . Oprah . Boring . Sally Jesse . Boring . African apes . Boring . Some congressman on C-Span . Boring . Star Trek : The Next Generation . Boring . War in Eastern Europe . Boring .... Tom took another hit , a little more carefully this time , and considered the question as he held the smoke in his lungs . Then he exhaled , and after the initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched on the answering machine . The thought of working bummed him out . " Want some ? " he asked , offering the bong to junior Bud . " Sure . " junior Bud barely diverted his attention from the TV as he extended his left hand across his right arm . just as Tom placed the bong in his palm , his friend sat bolt upright in his chair . " Whoa , check it out ! My favorite show ! " Tom gazed at the screen . Bud had found some Japanese anime . Enormous robots vaguely resembling shogun warriors were locked in combat , hacking at one another with giant plasma swords . Every now and then , the action was intercut with guys and chicks wearing skin-tight outfits , their eyes wide as saucers , their mouths tiny ovals moving out of synch with their overdubbed English dialogue . " Aw , dude , this sucks . " Tom shook his head . " Find something else . " " Naw , this is great ! " Junior Bud hunched forward , propping the bong between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's called .. it 's called .. well , I do n't remember what it 's called , but it 's great . " He reached for the lighter , then pointed to a blond-haired girl wearing what looked like a school uniform . One of the robots had just picked her up in his fist , and she was screaming in a shrill , high-pitched voice . junior Bud said , " Watch , man . I bet she gets her clothes ripped off . " Tom watched , and sure enough , a few seconds later the robot tore away the girl 's blouse and kerchief . She had a nice pair , he had to admit , but watching anime was n't exactly his idea of getting off . If anything , it only made him more frustrated . The last time he had a regular girlfriend was while he was still in college , but she dumped him after he dropped out in his freshman year , and ever since then the only time he got laid was when he picked up some high school skank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be doing much better if he was getting aroused by cartoons . " That robot 's a wimp , " Tom said , trying to change the subject . " My dad 's got a bigger one than that . " " No way . " junior Bud finally lit the bong . He sucked in a long hit , then raised his mouth from the smoking tube and regarded his lifelong friend with unfocused eyes . " That mofo 's fifty feet tall , " he croaked . " It ca n't be bigger than that . It 's scientifically impossible . " " Way , dude . It 's .... " Tom stopped to think about it for a moment , but found he could n't remember just how tall his father 's robot was . " Well , it 's bigger than that . " " Sure . As if . " " Truth , dude , " Tom swore as he reached for the bong . " It 's down at my dad 's plant , in the warehouse . He even let me work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud exhaled as he put his Nikes up on the coffee table . " Your ol " man never lets you near his stuff . " Junior Bud was correct . The elder Swift was reluctant to allow his son to use any of the miraculous inventions he and Bud 's father had devised during their youth . At least not since the time Tom had borrowed his ultrasonic cycloplane and attempted to fly it to New Jersey for the Monsters of Rock show at the Meadowlands . Fortunately , Tom ejected from the craft before it crashed in the Long Island Sound , but that escapade had caused him to be grounded for a month . " Yeah , well , he 's out of town . " On sudden impulse , Tom stood up . " I know where he keeps the keys . C'm on , I 'll show it to you . " " Aw , man .... " Junior Bud stared at the TV . " The Simpsons are coming on in a minute . " " You 've seen it before . " Tom picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go . " 2 . AN AMAZING ERRAND Tom and junior Bud climbed into Tom 's roadster , a bright red Jeep Wrangler with pneumatic jacks and monster speakers , and tore down the driveway of the Swift family estate where Tom lived in the guest house . They headed for Swift Enterprises , but first they stopped at the mall in the nearby town of Shopton because Junior Bud remembered that the new Fugazi CD was due out today . They spent a few minutes in the record store , looking for boarder music while trying to ignore the assistant manager following them through the aisles . Tom had been caught shoplifting in the store twice already , but each time the manager had been persuaded not to press charges after Mr. Swift made a few phone calls . Tom picked up four CDs and put them on his American Express card , then they left the mall and continued to his father 's plant . Swift Enterprises was a sprawling complex of laboratories , machine shops , and aircraft hangars spread across four square miles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Swift had expanded the plant by developing some useless wetlands adjacent to the runways . As they roared up to the gatehouse in front of the main entrance , an elderly security guard stepped out of the shack to greet them . " Turn that down ! " he shouted , cupping his ears against the music blasting from Tom 's car stereo . " What 'd you say ? " Tom asked indeterminably . " I said .. turn .. that ... down ! " the guard bellowed , angrily pointing to the CD deck beneath the dashboard . Tom turned to give Junior Bud a querulous look . " I think he wants you to turn it down , dude , " Bud said . He had his hands clasped together in his lap to conceal the pipe they had been smoking since leaving the mall . " Oh , yeah . Right . " Tom pushed the Pause button . " Hi , Mr. Ames . How are you today ? " " What are you doing here ? " Harlan Ames demanded . The former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tom Swift , Jr . ' s oldest friends , and Mr. Swift had found meaningful employment for him at the plant after the company had been forced to downsize . " I thought your father was out of town . " " Yes , sir , he is , " Tom said . " He 's .. uh , in Egypt right now . " " He told me he was going to Washington State . " Mr. Ames 's eyes narrowed suspiciously . " What are you doing here ? " he asked again . " Umm .. I left my sunglasses in his office , " Tom said . " I just came by to pick them up . " Mr. Ames said nothing for a moment . " If you left your sunglasses in your father 's office , " he said at last , " then what 's that you 're wearing ? " Too late , Tom suddenly realized his error . " Oh , these are my other sunglasses , " he lied opaquely , pointing to his retro-style Ray-Bans . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get them , " cause I 'm going surf .. I mean , to a job interview tomorrow , and the sun really hurts my eyes , y'know , and so I 'd like to go hit my dad 's office , y'know , see if they 're there , which I 'm sure they are , and ..... " " Yeah , yeah , sure . " Mr. Ames turned toward the shack , then he stopped to look back at the younger Swift . " You say you 've got a- job interview tomorrow ? " " Yes , sir , " Tom said . " At a major high-tech company . " " Uh-huh . I bet . " Mr. Ames shook his head in disgust as he marched into the gatehouse . A few seconds later he emerged with a temporary vehicle pass , which he stuck behind the windshield of Tom 's Jeep . " It expires at closing time , " he said . " Go get your sunglasses . " " Thanks , Mr. Ames . " Tom rubbed the bridge of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nice to see you again . " Mr. Ames glared at him , then shuffled back in the gatehouse , grumbling as he pressed the button that opened the electric gates . " If I did n't know better , " he muttered , " I 'd swear you were adopted . " " Senile ol " coot , " Tom crowed as he floored the gas pedal . A few seconds later , he pulled up in front of the main office building . Parking the Jeep in the slot marked Reserved-Swift , Tom climbed out and , followed by junior Bud , sauntered through the glass doors of the entrance . The receptionist gave him a sullen glare but remained quiet as he marched past the front desk , and Bud paused to help himself to some of the chocolate mints she kept in a bowl on the counter before he trailed his chum down the ground-floor hallway to the executive suite . His father 's secretary , who had been there since , like , forever , spotted Tom as he strode into the suite . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quickly , swiveling around behind her desk as she feigned a broad smile . " Your dad said that if you needed more , I could fax him and ..... " " Naw , naw . That 's cool . " Tom waved her off as he headed straight for the closed door of his father 's office . " I just stopped by to pick up my sun .. uhh , I think I left my jacket in his office , last time I was here . " " Oh .... " She seemed confused . " Well , I have n't found any jackets that look like yours , " she added helpfully , " but if your father did , he might have hung it in his closet .... " " He probably did . " Tom opened the door , reached inside to turn on the ceiling light . " Thanks , I 'll find it myself . " " Man , she 's really nice , " Junior Bud said as Tom shut the door behind them . " What 's her name ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . " Tom shrugged . " Miss Something . " The office had once belonged to his grandfather , but Mr. Swift had moved in shortly after the founder of Swift Enterprises passed away . The walls were lined with framed photos of the elder Swift , many taken in exotic places like the Amazon rainforest or Antarctica , and the shelves were filled with scale models of exotic-looking aircraft , submersibles , and spaceships , a few of which were chipped or missing pieces after Tom had played with them on the floor as a kid . Half-hidden behind a battered model of the jetmarine was a photo of the three Swifts , taken during Tom 's high school graduation . Tom was still wearing his hair long then , and he was flashing a two-fingered love sign at the camera . His father was smiling , his left arm around his son 's shoulder , but somehow his expression seemed embarrassed . His grandfather scowled from his magnetic levitational wheelchair . " Hey , dude , " Junior Bud murmured as Tom walked around behind the desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Forget it . He does n't drink . " Tom opened the top drawer , peered inside . Everything was neat and tidy : sharpened pencils , rubber bands , thumb tacks , blank notepads , an ancient sliderule . Only his father would still use a sliderule . " Bummer . " Bud prowled along the shelves , checking out the models and pictures , until his eye fell upon an ungainly contraption : four oversized dragonfly-like wings mounted upon a slender fuselage , with a propeller behind its rear stabilizer and a broad plastic fan attached to its nose . " Yo , what 's this thing ? " he asked , picking it up . " Some kinda airplane ? " Tom looked up from the desk " Whoa , dude ! Becareful with that ! It 's mine ! " " Huh ? What'dya mean , it 's .. ? " Junior Bud 's thumb accidentally found the switch on the object 's underside . The wings fluttered , then blurred into a flurry of motion as the aft propeller buzzed to life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rose toward the ceiling . " Aw , man ... ! " Tom dove beneath his father 's desk . " Do n't move , whatever you do ! " " Huh ? " Bud watched in amazement as the miniature aircraft began to circle the room . He lifted his hand to point at it . " Is this something your ol " man ... ? " All of a sudden , the drone turned around and hurled itself straight toward Junior Bud . " Hey ! " he shouted . " Jeez , it 's ... ! " Then the plastic fan smacked him in the face . " Oww ! " Bud yelped , then he backhanded the contraption across the room . It hit the wall behind the desk . One of its wings snapped and the device fell to the floor , its propeller still buzzing . " What the ... ? " " The ornithoptic insect annihilator . " Tom crept out from beneath the desk and carefully picked up the broken automaton . He located the power switch and turned it off ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . " The flying flyswatter , " Tom murmured , regarding it with forlorn nostalgia . " My greatest invention . " Tom had designed the ornithoptic insect annihilator a few years ago in an attempt to impress his father . It was meant to be a robotic drone that would automatically patrol a room , seeking out house flies and mosquitoes with its onboard motion detectors and getting rid of them without human intervention . His father had authorized a small production run based upon Tom 's prototype , but the flying flyswatter had n't worked as intended ; although it did an admirable job of killing flies , it also had an unfortunate tendency to home in upon anything else that moved . Although Mr. Swift canceled plans to distribute Tom 's invention on the American market , Swift Enterprises made a small profit by selling its overstock to the Ukrainian National Army . " Aw , man , " Junior Bud said . " Sorry I busted it . " " Never mind , man . It sucked anyway . " Tom carefully placed the flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . He found the key ring for which he had been searching in the top left drawer . " Got it , " he said , shoving the keys into a pocket of his shorts . " C'm on , let 's go see the robot . " Outside the office , they found Miss Trent still sitting at her desk . " Did you find your jacket , Tom ? " she asked . " Uhh ... oh , no , ma'am . " Tom kept his hands in his pockets to keep the key ring from jingling . " Guess I must have left it at home . Sorry to bother you . " " Well .. all right , then . " She gave Tom an uncertain look . " I have to call . your father in Washington in a few minutes . Do you want me to tell him anything for you ? " " No , no , that 's okay , " Tom said reaffirmingly as he walked toward the door . " I 'll see him when he gets home . Catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad 's in Egypt , " junior Bud said as they passed the reception desk again . He grabbed some more mints from the bowl and gave the receptionist another smile , which she pointedly ignored . " Egypt , Washington .... " Tom gave a world-weary shrug . " What 's the difference ? " 3 . FABULOUS INVENTIONS Tom drove his Jeep across the plant grounds to an enormous warehouse on the other side of the runway and parked in another reserved slot with his last name painted on it . The buzz he had collected before leaving home was beginning to wear off , so after looking around to make sure no one was in sight , he and Junior Bud stoked up the pipe and took a few hits . Then he stashed the pipe beneath the glove compartment and they climbed out of the Jeep . Mr. Swift 's master ring contained nearly thirty different keys , along with a miniature remote that Tom remembered to use to deactivate the security system . It took several minutes for Tom to locate the proper key , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse was pitchblack inside , and the two chums spent several more minutes wandering about in the darkness before they located the light switch next to the door . " Whoa , wicked ! " Junior Bud exclaimed as the ceiling fluorescents flickered to life . " What 's all this shit ? " Across the vast interior of the warehouse , all the way to the far wall , were parked machines and vehicles of all shapes and size , some larger than others . Each was covered with spotted plastic sheets or dusty canvas tarpaulins ; crates of spare parts were stacked nearby , and electrical cables snaked across the concrete floor . " Stuff my dad invented . " Tom led his friend down the center aisle . " That 's his electronic retroscope , and over there 's the triphibian atomicar .... " " What 's that thing ? " Junior Bud pointed to the largest object in the warehouse , a massive machine that vaguely resembled an enormous gyroscope . " A thermonuclear subatomic can-opener ? " " Naw , man , it 's .. uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I forgot . He flew it to the Moon once , though . " " Cool . " They made their way to the back of the warehouse , and poked around crates containing the disassembled remains of the space solartron , the atomic earth blaster , and the spectromarine selector , until behind a wooden cradle containing the hull of the jetmarine they found a manshaped object hidden beneath a tarp . A paper sign taped to its front read Ator . " Here it is , " Tom said , as he reached up to pull off the sheet . " My oll man 's robot . " Junior Bud gaped at it. - " Aw , dude , " he exclaimed , " you 're such a liar ! It 's only seven feet tall ! " " Uhh ... I thought it was bigger , " Tom admitted in a small voice . He also remembered it being a bit more impressive . The robot was plated with silver-gray Tomasite plastic save for the chain-mail covering the rotary joints of its arms and legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its chest . It had three-fingered claws for hands , and a pair of tube-shaped eyes protruded from its bucket-shaped head , from the top of which rose a slender wire aerial . For some weird reason , his father had chosen to give the robot a hinged jaw . " Man , this thing 's a piece of crap . " junior Bud stepped closer , rapped his knuckles against the robot 's chest . " Does n't it have any .. I du n no , laser beams or anything ? " " Chill , " Tom said frostily . " This was one of my dad 's first inventions , okay ? " He searched his memory . " I think he built it for use in nuclear power plants , but something screwed up . " Or maybe it did n't screw up . His father was pretty sharp , but sometimes his inventions were only used once . Like the levitating roadway he had designed to help logging companies drive trucks into the Amazon rain forest . Greenpeace loved that one .... " So it ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , right . More like C-3PO 's grandfather . " junior Bud walked around behind the robot . " Hey , check it out . It 's still plugged in . " Tom stepped around behind Ator . Sure enough , a fat yellow power cable led from a socket on the robot 's back to an electrical outlet on the warehouse wall . " Cool , " he murmured . " They must have kept it plugged in to keep the batteries from dying . " " Maybe it still works . " Bud grinned at him . " Think you can make it ? " Tom shrugged . " Sure . Why not ? " 4 . THE RETURN OF ATOR Tom and Bud rummaged around the warehouse until they located the crate containing the robot 's control unit , a wooden box with toggle switches , analog meters , and black plastic knobs on its Bakelite shell . " The world 's first remote , " Tom muttered as he opened it up to look inside . " Look .. it 's got vacuum tubes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got an old Fender amp I could use them in . " " No way , dude , " Tom said decisively . " My dad 'll get pissed if he finds this thing missing . " The control unit needed new batteries , but Tom found some D-cells in an equipment locker and inserted them within the unit . When he flipped the power switch , the box hummed to life and the dials glowed orange-red . Tom remembered that the knobs controlled the robot 's movements , but when he turned one of them , Ator remained still . The two churns puzzled over this for a few minutes until Tom snapped his fingers . " Aw , man ! " he exclaimed . " I forgot to turn the robot on ! " " I 'll get it . " Junior Bud sauntered over to the robot and inspected its chest panel until he found a button marked Power . He pressed it , but still nothing happened . " Maybe we got ta unplug it first , " he said . Then he went around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . There was a low electrical throb from deep within Ator 's chest , and then its eye-tubes emitted a bright yellow glow . " Yeah , that did it , " Tom said . " Get out of the way and lemme see if I can make this thing go . " Tom turned the right knob to the right , and Ator 's right arm swung upward in a swift , flat-handed arc . " Hey , look at that ! " Bud yelled . " It 's doing the Hitler thing ! " Tom pushed it to the left , and the other arm raised to same position . " Cool , " Bud said . " Now it 's doing Frankenstein . " " Shut up , " Tom snapped . " I 'm trying to get it to walk . " He studied the control unit , struggling to make sense of its various dials and toggles . It had been many years since the time the senior Swift had showed him how to operate Ator , and even then it had been only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arms , then what moved its legs ? He turned the left knob to the right . Ator took a step forward , its right leg making a metallic grinding noise as its foot settled on the cement floor with a solid clunk . Tom turned the knob to the left and the robot 's left leg followed suit . " Real impressive , " Bud said . " But you said it was sixty feet tall . " " Do n't start with me , " Tom began . The two friends played with the robot for a while , getting it to walk forward , then backward , then to swing its arms back and forth . At first Ator moved slowly , the chain mail covering its joints rasping with each movement it made , its eyes flickering a bit until Tom discovered how to increase the voltage . After that the robot was easy to control ; Tom marched it down the warehouse aisle , then stopped it in the middle of the warehouse floor . Tom had just succeeded in getting Ator to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse . He ran to a nearby window , peered out just in time to see Harlan Ames getting out of a white Land Rover with rack lights mounted on its roof . " We got ta blow , " Tom hissed . " It 's that old guy again . " When he looked back around , though , Junior Bud was nowhere to be seen . And the control unit was missing ! No time to worry about that now . The elderly security guard had already checked out Tom 's jeep , and now was walking toward the warehouse door . Tom dashed past Ator , still standing on one leg , and headed for the front door . He got there in time to meet Mr. Ames just as he opened the door . The old watchman stepped back in alarm , his right hand falling upon the taped handle of his night stick , before he recognized the young heir to the Swift fortune . " What the heck are you are doing in here ? " he demanded . " Just looking around , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I left my jacket in here . " Mr. Ames gave him a skeptical eye . " You told me you were looking for your sunglasses . " " Uhh ... whatever . " Tom reached over to switch off the lights , then stepped through the door and slammed it shut behind him . " Thanks for letting me look . I think I left them at home or something . " He started to walk past Ames , but the guard raised a hand to stop him . " Hold it right there , son . Where 's your buddy ? " At that instant , Tom spotted Junior Bud creeping around the side of the warehouse . He held the control unit beneath his right arm , and while Mr. Ames had his back turned to him he moved quickly and quietly to Tom 's Jeep . " Who ? " Tom said innocently , trying to stall the guard . " Do n't play dumb with me . I know he 's still in there . " Pulling his key ring from his belt , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , Tom ! " Junior Bud yelled . " C'm on , let 's go ! We 're late for choir practice ! " Startled , Mr. Ames turned to see the other youth sitting in the passenger seat of the Jeep . The control unit was nowhere in sight . " Oh , that guy ! " Tom said foolishly . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Ames . I thought you meant someone else . " Ames glared first at Tom , then at Bud . " Hey , Mr. Ames , " Bud called , " why is n't there a bathroom in there ? I had to go around back and find a tree . " The guard took a step toward the Jeep , and for a moment Tom was certain that he would find the control unit under the back seat . " I 'll tell my dad we saw you today , " he said observantly . " I 'm sure he 'll want to know you 've been doing your job . " Mr. Ames stopped , and Tom detected the uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was the owner of Swift Enterprises ; there was no reason why his son should n't be allowed to visit one of the company warehouses , was there ? And Mr. Ames was well past retirement age ; he could n't afford to lose his job just because he had harassed the boss 's kid . " Go on , get out of here . " Mr. Ames cocked his head toward the Jeep . " Beat it before I go looking for dope . " " Thanks , Mr. Ames . Have a nice day . " Tom strolled past him to the jeep and climbed in behind the wheel . junior Bud grinned at Mr. Ames and gave him a little wave as they backed away from the warehouse . Ames glowered at them , then turned to make sure that the door was locked . " Oh , man , you scared the piss out of me , " Tom expelled . He glanced in the back of the Jeep as he drove toward the front gate . The control unit was on the floor below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " I du n no . " Junior Bud turned around to pick up the box . " I just thought it looked cool . " " Dude .... " Tom shook his head . " My dad 's gon na be wicked pissed when he finds out it 's missing . " " Are you kidding ? He probably has n't seen it in years . " Junior Bud put the unit in his lap and absently fiddled with the knobs . " C'm on , lighten up . Let 's go back to the mall . " 5 . A STRANGE ENCOUNTER Twilight had fallen upon Shopton by the time Tom and junior Bud returned to the mall . They smoked another bowl out in the parking lot while Bud played with the control unit , then they left the box in the jeep while they went into the mall . The two pals were hungry now , so they visited the food court and got some pizza , which they heartily consumed at a nearby table while eyeing the girl working behind the counter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she wanted to go party after she got off work , but she ignored him until her manager came out front and told Bud to leave . Bud did so , but not before he pocketed a handful of ketchup packets ; he got his revenge by mashing them on the floor beneath their table . " Anarchy rules ! " he shouted as they left the food court , and the Arby 's manager stared back at them in confusion . They wandered in and out of stores until they found their way to the ten-screen cineplex at the other end of the mall . They had already seen most of the movies playing there , and the ones they had n't seen were lame , but since there was nothing else to do they decided to see again a Robert De Niro gangster movie which they agreed had n't sucked too much the first time they had seen it . Tom was out of cash and the nearest ATM machine was all the way back in the food court , so he whipped out his trusty AmEx card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid him back by buying popcorn and a box of Skittles . They managed to sit through the first half of the film before they remembered how it ended . Bud expressed his critical displeasure by throwing the rest of the popcorn on the floor , then they got up and left . " Life sucks , " Tom said vacuously as they walked out of the theater . " Yeah , dude . " junior Bud shoved his hands in his pockets and glared at the children waiting in line with their parents for the latest Disney movie . " Let 's go back to your place and smoke some dope . " " Yeah , cool . Maybe we can catch The Real World on .... " It was at that moment that they came upon the Radio Shack where Tom had applied for a job yesterday . The middle-aged store manager who had given him an employment application was standing just inside the door , demonstrating an answering machine to an elderly woman . Tom ducked his head and tried to quickly shuffle past , but the manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom ! Hold on ! " He excused himself from his customer , then stepped out into the mall . " Come back to see about that job ? " " Umm ... yeah , sure . " Tom glanced at the name tag pinned to his red vest : Rick Brant . " I just happened to be passing through , and I was wondering .... " " Of course you were . " Mr. Brant regarded him curiously . " Say , have you visited an eye doctor lately ? Your pupils are blood-shot . " " Uhh .... " Damn ! Wrong time to leave his Ray-Bans in the car . Junior Bud had drifted away to study the lingerie on display at the Victoria 's Secret next door . " Just came from the movie . I think I was sitting too close to the screen . " " Sure . " Mr. Brant seemed unconvinced . " Anyway , about that job . I looked at your application , Tom , and .... " " I wo n't be able to start next week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else going on , and .... " " Perhaps that 's just as well , " Mr. Brant said , " because I was n't going to offer you the job anyway . " As Tom gazed at him in astonishment , the store manager went on . " I think I need someone a little more .. well , mature ... to work here . " " Mature ? " Tom exclaimed childishly . " I 'm twenty years old , man ! How mature do you got ta be to run a friggin " cash register at Radio Shack ? " He had n't meant to shout , but the old lady standing nearby glanced over her shoulder to glare at him . Mr. Brant gazed at him stoically as he folded his arms across his chest . " When your father was only seventeen .... " " Hell with my father ! " Tom said infernally . " I 'm sick of hearing about him ! " " I do n't doubt you are . I would be , too , if I were you . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all I wanted to do was the same things he was doing .. I was an inventor once myself . I ... Mr. Brant sighed and shook his head . " Never mind . It 's a long story . But I did n't have the opportunities you have now . If I did , do you think I 'd be here ? " Tom started to retort , yet the wisecrack he wanted to make somehow could n't find its way past his lips . There was a certain sadness in Mr. Brant 's face , and Tom suddenly realized that he was gazing upon his own future . Spending his waning years in a New Jersey shopping mall , price  --  marking toy RC cars and trying to show some old biddy how to operate an answering machine .... " Rick ! " The gray-haired woman turned to bark at Mr. Brant . " How do you get your voice to come out of this thing ? " " I 'll be right with you . " Mr. Brant rubbed his eyes . " I swear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a clue . " Then he looked at Tom again . " Son , it 's been a long time since I was twenty , but I think I know what guys your age would say . Dude .. get a life . " Before Tom could reply , Mr. Brant turned and walked back into the store . " All right , Mrs. Drew . Let me show you how this works .... " junior Bud noticed the wounded expression on Tom 's face as his friend slowly walked away from the Radio Shack . " Hey , man , what was that all about ? " " I du n no , " Tom said cryptically . " Let 's just get out of here . " 6 . ROBOT AmoK ! Life sucks . On the other hand , why did his world feel so empty ? Tom contemplated this notion as he and junior Bud moseyed their way toward the entrance . Maybe getting stoned and hanging out in the mall was n't all that life was about . It might not be holding down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things his father had invented a long time ago had made him wonder if there was more to living than just getting by . All his other friends were either in college or had steady jobs ; they had ambitions that went beyond finding a good party next weekend . What was he doing tonight ? Going back to his parents " house to do bong hits with Junior Bud . I 'm mature , he thought . I 'm twenty years old . How responsible do you have to be to get some respect ? When they reached the front entrance , they were startled to see people rushing through the glass doors . A fat lady in a Hawaiian-print muumuu nearly collided with Tom as she ran screaming past them . A yup was yelling into his cell phone ; a couple of teenagers stared through the windows at something outside . From the far distance they could hear the whoop-whoop of an approaching police cruiser . " Whoa , " Bud murmured as they sauntered past everyone . " What'dya think this is all about ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's check it out . " A crowd had gathered on the sidewalk outside the mall , their attention focused upon the parking lot . The blue lights of the police car strobed against the yellow sodium lights at the far edge of the lot , but it was gridlocked behind traffic attempting to leave and was n't getting any closer . More people came toward them , and they joined the throng outside the mall even as Tom and Bud pushed through the mob . Tom stopped at the edge of the sidewalk . Now he could see the cause of the commotion . Ator was striding through the parking lot , its claws raised menacingly , its eyes flickering in the dark Long Island night with each step it took . An empty shopping cart stood in its path , instead of stepping around it , however , Ator picked it up and hurled it through the windshield of a nearby Toyota . Bystanders dashed for cover as the giant robot marched past them , a mindless juggernaut that paid no attention to any obstacles in its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great feeling . Ator picked up the front end of a double-parked Volkswagen and shoved it against the Datsun minivan next to it . It could n't be mere coincidence that Ator happened to be here . After all , the robot had still been activated when they left Swift Enterprises . Somehow or another , Bud must have done something with the control unit that caused the robot to follow its radio signal from the warehouse to the mall . " Umm .... " Junior Bud stepped back . " Maybe we oughtta check out the arcade . " Tom 's first impulse was to follow his friend 's advice . If they made themselves scarce , maybe they would n't catch the heat for any of this . But the robot would still be here , and people could get hurt . " Naw , man , " he said negatively . " This is our fault . We got ta do something about it . " He did n't hear an answer . When he looked around , Junior Bud was no longer standing next to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend as he dashed across the parking lot , heading for where they had parked the Jeep . " Hey ! " Tom yelled . " Hold up , dude ! You got ta help me here ! " Yet Junior Bud was way ahead of him . He got to the Jeep first , and snatched the control unit from behind the back seat . " I 'm getting rid of the evidence ! " Bud yelled back as Tom ran after him . " I 'll call you tomorrow or whatever ! " Then he turned and ran down the row of parked cars , clutching the box against his chest . " Wuss ! " Tom shouted boldly . " That 's the last time I ... I .... " He could n't think of a decent threat , and besides , junior Bud was already halfway across the parking lot . " See if I invite you to my next party ! " He heard a crash from behind him , and turned just in time to see the robot pick up an abandoned baby stroller and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking the signal from the control unit ; Tom had little doubt that the robot would follow Junior Bud clear across Long Island , in the meantime leaving behind a trail of destruction . Now the robot was headed his way . Behind him , Tom could hear more police cruisers approaching the mall . Yet he knew that the Shopton cops were ill-equipped to take down a seven-foot robot . Like it or not , he was the only person around who knew how to stop Ator before it harmed someone . " Oh , hell , " Tom muttered . " Maybe I can still get into the Army when this is all over . " The robot was marching down the row when Tom stepped directly in front of it . " Hey ! " he shouted , waving his hands over his head . " Yo , Ator ! Mechanical dude ! Stop ! Pull over ! Chill ! " Yet the robot did n't pause for an instant . Too late , Tom remembered that voice-recognition software had n't been invented when his father had cobbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad had n't been a little more cutting-edge when Ator swung its right arm at him . Its claw nearly took off the top of his head before Tom hurled himself to the ground . He yelled in pain as the asphalt skinned his knees and the palms of his hands , and he rolled out of the way just in time to avoid being trampled by the robot . Tom picked himself off the ground , watched as Ator stomped past him . All right , so calling a time-out obviously was n't going to work . But maybe he could reach the power switch on its chest panel . Tom hesitated , then he lunged after the automaton . Ator did n't detect his presence until Tom leaped straight onto its back . He wrapped his arms around its head and blindly scrabbled for the chest panel farther down the robot 's thorax . For a few moments Tom was sure that he could reach the power button ; from somewhere in the distance he could hear people shouting , urging him to hang on . But now Ator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung around , its left claw reached back to grab Tom 's shirt . Tom yelped as the claw ripped against his skin , then the robot tore him off its back and tossed him aside . His shirt ripped as he skidded across the pavement , and fireflies danced across his vision when the back of his head connected with the ground . For a few seconds , Tom lay prone on the ground , the breath knocked out of him , blood running from his scraped back . He had n't hurt this bad since he had played goalie for the Shopton High soccer team . Of course , he had been bounced from the team after the coach had discovered a joint in his locker , but that was n't the point . Not only was he in considerable pain , but he was also good and pissed . " Dude , " Tom murmured hotly as he staggered to his feet , " you are serious toast . " He dug his hands into the pockets of his shorts as he lurched toward his jeep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the row . A cop jumped out and yelled at him to stop , but Tom ignored him as he crawled behind the wheel and jammed the key into the ignition . The engine rumbled to life , and Tom slammed the stick into first gear and left rubber behind as he punched out of the parking space . Ator was dead in front of him as Tom 's jeep tore down the parking lot . He shifted to second and put the pedal to the floor , and braced his hands against the wheel as the headlights caught the sleek surface of the robot 's back . " Eat me ! " Tom spat , and an instant later the Jeep 's front end slammed against the robot . Ator 's chest snapped forward and its arms flung outward as the robot wrapped itself around the hood . The left headlight shattered ; friction sparks whisked past the windshield and metal shrieked against metal as Ator was dragged beneath the vehicle . Tom felt a hard multiple bump against the tires as he ran over the robot , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder , the robot was still intact . Although there was a large dent in its back and one of its eyes was broken , nonetheless Ator was clambering to its knees . Damn , but the old man built " em to last , did n't he ? Tom grabbed the stick and jammed it into reverse , then planted his foot on the gas pedal . The Jeep 's tires screeched as it hurtled backward toward the robot . Ator was almost on its feet again when the Jeep 's rear bumper caught it square in the middle of the chest . Its right arm connected with the roll-bar just behind Tom 's head . Tom ducked , but kept his foot against the gas pedal . He heard voices shouting at him , and at the last second he glanced at the side mirror and saw police officers running away from their cruiser , then his Jeep slammed straight into the cop car . Jagged pieces of Tomasite were strewn across the parking lot as the robot was crushed between the two vehicles . Something made a loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's remaining eye went dark . Its jaw sagged open as its limbs suddenly went limp , and then the robot sagged forward and sprawled across the back of the Jeep . Tom climbed out of the Jeep . " It 's okay , officers ! " he shouted with authority , raising his hands . " Everything 's under control ! Just call my dad , he 'll take care of everything ! " " I 'm sure he will . " One of the cops was already pulling out his handcuffs . " You have the right to remain silent .... " 7 . A HERO 's REWARD Tom opened his eyes when he heard the door to the cell block open . He yawned and sat up as a police officer approached the door of the holding cell . " Okay , you 're free to go , " the officer said as he unlocked the door and pushed it open . " Your bail 's been paid . There 's someone waiting for you out front . " A dapper young gentleman carrying a briefcase stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced himself as Mr. Hardy , a senior partner with the law firm of Hardy , Hardy &; Sons , and he waited patiently while Tom relaced the sneakers of his basketball shoes before he escorted the young man out to where his car was parked . " The charges include damage to private property , reckless driving , possession of a controlled substance , and operation of dangerous equipment within city limits , " Mr. Hardy said as he drove Tom toward his home . " We may be able to plea-bargain them down to lesser charges , once the judge has been informed that you were acting to prevent the robot from causing any further damage .... " " Solid . " Tom hungrily eyed the Pizza Hut they had just driven past . " Hey , can we stop somewhere ? I 'm starving . " Mr. Hardy ignored him . " We can be sure that there will be civil suits as well , " he continued . " Swift Enterprises has already received a call from the mall , and we 'll probably be hearing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the robot damaged . " " Has my dad phoned yet ? " Tom asked . He imagined that the elder Swift would be righteously pissed about all this . Indeed , Tom was prepared to be grounded for at least a month . " I spoke with your father about an hour ago . He 's flying home as soon as he 's concluded his business with Mr. Gates . " The attorney allowed himself a judicious smile . " Among other things , we discussed the possibility of you completing your education . " " Go back to college ? " Tom shrugged . " Yeah , well , I guess that 'd be cool . Maybe someplace up in New Hampshire . " He 'd heard about some wicked party schools in New England . Besides , he had always wanted to try snowboarding . " Actually , we were thinking of sending you a little farther away . " Mr. Hardy 's smile became a broad grin . " New Zealand , maybe .. or perhaps Guam . " Tom stared out at the passing street lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little did he know that the Hydroponic Marijuana Cultivator lay in his future , and the exciting adventures that this invention would bring . " You do n't think we could stop for a taco , do you ? " he asked saucily .
