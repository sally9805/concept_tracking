When the transcript of a June 22 closed hearing in the sexual-assault case of Kobe Bryant was inadvertently released , the press had the expected field day . In the document , defense expert Dr. Elizabeth Johnson presented evidence that suggested Bryant 's accuser may have had sex with another man not long after her encounter with Bryant  --  raising doubts about whether it was Bryant who caused the former college student 's vaginal trauma and lending credence to his assertion that the sex was consensual . Speculation flew that the prosecution 's case was collapsing and that the charges would be dropped . <P> But the transcript suggests that Johnson 's testimony was not so clear-cut . In his questioning of the doctor , district attorney Mark Hurlbert raised doubts about the number of sperm cells and whether they could have dated from an earlier sexual encounter . And if the prosecution is losing its resolve in the case , it certainly did n't show in Hurlbert 's immediate and aggressive appeal to Judge Terry Ruckriegle to set an early trial date . Prosecutors are refusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the accuser 's attorneys went on television to suggest that she might have better luck with a civil case . As for the accuser herself , a friend tells TIME that the relentless publicity  --  including the mistaken release of her name on three occasions  --  has taken its toll : " She cut all ties to her friends . She 's like a ghost . " <P>  --  By Rita Healey
