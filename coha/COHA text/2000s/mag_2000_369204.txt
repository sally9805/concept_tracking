Even as the latest Harry novel climbed best-seller lists , Eminem 's new CD , The Marshall Mathers LP ( that being the artist 's real name ) , was lording over the pop charts . The disc , loaded with violent and misogynistic imagery , proved irresistible to millions of teenage boys . While some puritanical teachers and parents tried to demonize Harry  --  he is a wizard , after all  --  there was a far more blatant dark side to Eminem .
