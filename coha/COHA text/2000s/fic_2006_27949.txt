Midnight Moon By Handeland , Lori St. Martin 's Paperbacks Handeland , Lori I got off the plane in Port-au-Prince for the second time in my life about midafternoon on a sunny Thursday in October . Not much had changed . Heat wavered above the asphalt , shimmering , dancing , making me dizzy . Inside the airport , a man whose starched white short-sleeved shirt and khaki trousers emphasized the ebony shade of his skin hurried over . " Priestess Cassandra ? " I winced . What had been good business in New Orleans sounded pretentious in the shadow of the mountains where voodoo had first come into its own . " Just Cassandra , please , " I murmured . I wondered momentarily how he 'd known me . Perhaps my being the only white woman who 'd gotten off the plane was a pretty good clue . I 'm sure my blue eyes and short dark hair were n't all that common around here , either . But what usually made me stand out in a crowd was the slash of pure white at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair shortly after my daughter died , had gradually lost pigment from its original gray . I probably should have covered it with dye -- I was , after all , in witness protection -- but the white strip served to remind me of my daughter and my mission . As if I needed reminding . The streak also served as my penance . I had n't done the one thing a mother was supposed todo -- protect her child against everyone . Even her father . The man in front of me dipped his head . " I am Marcel , Miss Cassandra . " His accent hinted at France . A lovely lilt in English ; in Creole , the language of the island , he 'd sound fabulous . I opened my mouth to tell him my last name , then realized I no longer had one . Once I 'd testified against my scum-sucking , drug-dealing pig of a husband I 'd become Priestess Cassandra , one name only --  la Cher , the Rock , Madonna . WITSEC , short for witness protection folks , had been unamused when I 'd refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little amused them . They 'd slapped Smith on my records , but the name was n't any more mine than Cassandra . " Monsieur Mandenauer has arranged for a room at the Hotel Oloffson , " Marcel said , taking possession of the single bag I 'd carried onto the plane . I 'd recently joined a group of government operatives known as the Jger-Suchers . That 's Hunter-Searchers if your German is as nonexistent as mine . The Jger-Suchers hunt monsters , and I 'm not using the euphemism applied to so many human beings who belong in a cage . I mean monsters -- the type whose skin sprouts fur , whose teeth become fangs -- beasts that drink the blood of humans and only want more . Edward Mandenauer was my new boss . He 'd sent me to Haiti to discover the secret of raising a zombie . I loved it when my personal and work interests collided . Almost made me give credence to that " there are no accidents " theory . " This way , please . " Marcel awaited me at the door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shady , cool interior of the building and stepping into the bright , sunny bustle of Port-au-Prince . Though Haiti is horrendously overpopulated -- the newest estimates say 8.5 million souls -- there is also a vast amount of uncharted , unexplored , and nearly unexplorable land in the mountains . I was certain any secrets worth uncovering lay in that direction . I glanced at the teeming crowd of humanity that made up the capital city . Secrets certainly could n't be kept here . Marcel had parked at the curb in direct defiance of the signs ordering him not to do so . He held the passenger door , and I climbed inside , nearly choking on the scalding air within . After tossing my bag into the back , Marcel jumped behind the wheel , cranking the air conditioner to high , before setting off at a speed meant to crush any slow-moving bystanders . In a very short time , we squealed to a stop in front of a large Victorian mansion . The Hotel Oloffson was originally built as a presidential summer palace . Used by the marines as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the first hotel in Haiti . Marcel led me up the steps and into the foyer . The hotel was expecting me , and in short order I followed Marcel into one of the veranda rooms with a view of the city . He dropped my bag to the floor with a thud . " Monsieur Mandenauer has arranged for you to meet a friend . " " Edward has friends here ? " Marcel slid me a glance . " He has friends everywhere . " Of course he did . " This friend will help you find what you seek . " I frowned . " You know what I seek ? " " There was a little trouble with a curse , oui ? " I would n't have referred to the beast ravaging New Orleans as a " little " trouble , but it sounded as if Marcel knew the basics . In the Crescent City I 'd seen amazing things , but none as fantastic as a man changing into a wolf and back again . Werewolves are real . You might think this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member , but it was n't . Because if the werewolves of legend exist , does n't it follow that zombies do , too ? " Edward told you why he sent me ? " " To remove a curse , you need the voodoo queen who performed it , and she is dead . " " For about a hundred and fifty years . " Marcel lowered his voice to just above a whisper . " You must raise her from the grave . Zombie . " Not exactly . To raise a shuffling , decaying , frightening nightmare was not what I aspired to do . Though a George Romero Night of the Living Dead type zombie might be enough to satisfy Edward , it was not enough to satisfy me . I could n't sentence my child to become such a creature . I 'd been searching for a way to bring life from death since I 'd left here the last time . All I 'd found was more death . Then I began to hear whispers of incredible power in these mountains , an ability beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't had the means to return to Haiti , neither the funds to search the island the way it needed to be searched nor the cash to pay for what a secret like that must cost . Until now . I strolled onto the veranda and stared at the distant hills . Somewhere out there was a voodoo priest who , according to the latest rumors , could raise the dead to live again . As if they 'd never been dead at all . Continues ... by Handeland , Lori
