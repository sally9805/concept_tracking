It is almost an article of faith in politics that when it comes to health care , the safest route for a candidate is to talk small  --  or not at all . And if there 's anyone who should know enough to stay away from the subject , it 's former House minority leader Dick Gephardt , who had a front-row seat when Bill Clinton 's health-care plan collapsed in 1994 . But that , Gephardt says , is precisely why he 's betting his presidential campaign on a costly plan to provide health care to the 41 million Americans who now lack it . Why does Gephardt think his proposal can succeed where Clinton 's failed ? " I wanted something that was much simpler , that threatened fewer groups and would be seen as fair , " he told TIME . Gephardt 's plan retains the most controversial part of Clinton 's : a requirement that every employer provide coverage for every worker . In return the government would give employers a tax credit worth 60% of what they have spent . But Gephardt has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bureaucracy and sidesteps issues like whether to pay for abortion . Gephardt says his proposal would be good for businesses that already insure their workers because it would double their current tax benefit ; for companies without a health plan , he says , it would make one affordable . He argues that the tax credits would stimulate the economy and help strapped state and local governments to cover their workers . The plan 's big drawback is its price tag  --  $213 billion the first year and upward from there  --  which does not exactly bolster the Democrats ' case that they 're the party of fiscal discipline . And the plan does little to contain the soaring cost of health care . But Gephardt has accomplished at least one thing : he has put health care back on the political map .  --  By Karen Tumulty
