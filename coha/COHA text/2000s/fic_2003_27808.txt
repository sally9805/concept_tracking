All change is a miracle to contemplate ; but it is a miracle which is taking place every instant . I gunned the engine , pulled the truck out of my parking space , and flew over the speed bumps on my way out of the apartment complex . A young mother grabbed her toddler and gave me a dirty look . I thumped the face of my watch , and the second hand seemed to groan before deciding to move . Too late now , I 'll never make it , I thought , glancing at the clock in my dashboard . I could n't believe it ; I was never late . I 'd noticed that my watch was having problems a couple days earlier and had been relying on an extra clock in my bathroom to make sure I was showered and out the door on time . As I was shaving I must have accidentally pulled out the cord just enough to stop the clock from running . The tires squealed as I pulled out onto the main road , and the gardener working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty look of the morning , even shaking his head for effect . If I made all the stoplights through town , I could get to the hospital in fifteen minutes . Turning into the hospital lot , I glanced at the clock-fourteen minutes-a new personal record . There was no time to circle for a spot , so I parked at the far end of the lot and ran for the main entrance . Maybe he has n't started yet . Who was I kidding ? Dr. Goetz never failed to start on time . I ran faster between the rows of cars . As part of my third-year medical rotations , the university had placed me under the tutelage of Dr. Crawford Goetz-the best cardiologist in the hospital . Cardiology was n't part of a normal rotation block , but the university felt that a rotation in cardiology would only enhance a student 's studies . So , I was stuck for the next four weeks with Dr. Goetz . He was a Harvard and Vanderbilt man , the chief of cardiology , father of four , grandfather of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized in pediatric cardiology , but since the hospital had only a small number of child patients a year , as department head , Dr. Goetz would also oversee the treatment of adult patients . In each of our rotations , a medical student was part of a team that consisted of an attending physician , three to four students , and an upper-level resident . Peter Vashti was the upper-level resident on Dr. Goetz 's team . My clipboard with the day 's rounds was hanging at the nurses ' station , the last to be picked up . The other students and Peter were already following Dr. Goetz from room to room . I checked the room number for the first patient to be seen and ran to catch up , sneaking in behind William Radcliff , an old friend and fellow student who , to my good fortune , stood six-five . Dr. Goetz was sitting on the patient 's bed , a forty-seven-year-old man recovering from open-heart surgery . " She 's working like a thirty-year-old 's heart , " Dr. Goetz said . " Does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's wife asked , cracking a wad of gum . Dr. Goetz laughed . He had a carefree , easy way with his patients and their families ; too bad that did n't translate to his students . " So everything feels normal ? " Dr. Goetz asked , resting his hand on the patient 's shoulder . " He 's cranky again , " the wife said , her gum exploding like a firecracker . " Is that good or bad ? " " I do n't know if it 's good or bad , but for him it 's normal , " his wife continued . The patient looked sheepish . Poor guy , no wonder he had heart surgery . She was relentless . " All right , Jason , " Dr. Goetz said , smiling . " You 're ready to go home . " The man shook Dr. Goetz 's hand and I could see his eyes fill with tears ; he started to speak , then stopped . He did n't want to get emotional in front of a handful of medical students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked down at the sheet resting on his lap . Dr. Goetz squeezed his shoulder and turned to leave , nodding for us to follow . Filing back into the hallway , we could hear Jason 's wife get an early start on what could be heart attack number two . " What do you mean you 're not going to wear the piece ? Just because your heart 's working again does n't mean your hair 's going to grow back . Put this on . Put this on , or I 'm not walking out these doors with you , I mean it . I will not walk out these doors . " For the sake of his heart , I hoped his head would shine like the new dawn as he left the hospital . " Who 's our next patient , " Dr. Goetz asked , scribbling something onto Jason 's chart . " Andrews ? " I looked down at the chart in my hands . " The patient in room 2201 . " " Mr. Andrews , " he said , as if giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as you were not given a number at birth , but a name , you will find that your patients came into the world in the exact same manner . Learn who they are , not where they 're located . " I could feel sweat break out on my upper lip . I never intended to seem demeaning toward the patient . " I did n't mean it that ... " I began , but it was too late . Dr. Goetz had already learned the name of the patient and was leading the students through the halls . " And Mr. Andrews , as a reminder , your rotation begins at six A.M. Not six eighteen . " I felt my chest tighten . I should have known that Dr. Goetz would pick up on my tardiness . During a break in rounds , I retreated to the lounge and sank into the sofa . I leaned my head against the wall and rubbed my temples . If I 'd known there was going to be someone like Dr. Goetz in my future , I never would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I glanced at my watch and noticed it had stopped running again . I tapped the face , but the second hand would n't budge . I took the watch off and flipped it over to thump the battery casing . I ran my finger over the inscription : With all the love in the world , Mom . My mother died about a year after she stood with me on the hill overlooking the valley . Maybe she knew she 'd never see me grow up ; perhaps she was preparing me for the long valley I would go through without her , or maybe preparing her family and herself for death was the final step of faith she would take . I remember my father coming into my room during the early morning hours of that Christmas . He said that my mother had stepped into Heaven . He let my sister Rachel sleep ; she was much too young to understand what was happening anyway . I ran to the living room , where my mother lay still on the hospital bed ; my grandmother was holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest time , praying she 'd move again , that she 'd reach for me and say , You need to get back into bed , Little Man , but she could n't reach for me , and I knew it . She was thirty-four years old . Wilson 's Department Store was about to close on that Christmas Eve as I ran from one department to the next looking for the perfect gift until the shoes caught my eye on a sales rack . I ran them to the front register and pulled a crumpled wad of bills and loose change out of my jeans pocket . When the clerk told me I did n't have enough money , I was heartbroken . I just had to buy those shoes for my mother . I turned to a man behind me , and , before I knew what was happening , he paid for the shoes , and I ran out the door for home . When I helped my mother unwrap the shoes , she held them to her chest and made me feel as if I 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I started leaving shoes on her tombstone again when I was sixteen . The owner of Wilson 's somehow found a similar pair every year and ordered them for me . During the last weeks of her life , my mother wrote a series of letters to my sister Rachel and me . In one addressed to me she wrote , Dear Nathan , I have had many joys in my life but none that have compared to you and Rachel . I always want you to know that I fell more in love with you every day . Please do n't ever dread Christmas , Nathan , but remember to look for the miracles instead . It may be hard to see them at times but they will always be there because Christmas is the season for miracles . She finished the letter and signed it , With all the love in the world , Mom . I was helping my mother string lights on the shrubs outside our home the winter before she got sick when she first told me about the miracles of Christmas . " Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long strand around a juniper yew . " He left Heaven to live here . " She bent over the back of the yew and tugged at the lights , stuck on a low branch . I pulled along with her , and together we continued wrapping the bush . " That 's kind of like us becoming a worm and living in the dirt , " she said , wiping her nose . " Love came down on Christmas , Nathan . That 's the greatest miracle of all . That 's the true blessing of Christmas and why it will always be the season for miracles . " She stood back and admired her work , frowning at the tangled mess . " It 'll look better when the lights are on . " She dug into the box and pulled out another jumbled string , talking as she worked . " If you get too busy , you wo n't see the miracles that are taking place right in front of you , " she said , replacing a blown light . Before she died , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted my father to give them to us on our sixteenth birthdays . Rachel got a gold locket and I got this watch-a flat , gold-faced Timex with a simple black band . The inscription was a reminder of something I 'd always asked her . " Is your love for me as big as Texas ? " " Bigger , " she 'd say . " As big as the United States ? " " Bigger . " " As big as the world ? " " It 's even bigger than the world ! But if you combined all the love in the world , it might come close to how much I love you , " my mother told me . I 'd worn the watch every day since my father gave it to me , as promised , on my sixteenth birthday , Soon after my mother 's death I told my father and grandmother that I wanted to be a doctor . When people asked what I wanted to be when I grew up I responded the same . I wanted to be a doctor so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew it , I was through college and into medical school . What a tribute to your mother 's memory , an aunt would say or , What a tremendous way to honor your mother , an old family friend would comment . I felt the pressure mounting-people were counting on me to become a physician-my mother 's memory depended on it . But after three months of rotations and watching people suffer and die , and now a week with Dr. Goetz , I questioned whether I 'd made the right decision . In all honesty , when someone died it left me emotionally drained , and I was taken back to the morning my mother passed away . I felt as if I did n't measure up , that I was n't cut out for it . I opened my eyes and realized I needed to get back to rounds . Our team gathered outside the patient 's room , and Micah , another third-year med student on our team , stepped forward and began to give the patient 's blood pressure , pulse , heart rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . Micah was the " gunner " of our group-a med student 's term to describe a fellow student who was always the first to answer , the first to volunteer for a procedure , the first to give stats on someone else 's patient , and the first to get on other students ' nerves . The term had been around long before we ever applied to medical school . William and I shot each other glances as Micah handed out Xeroxed copies of an article on angioplasty from one of our textbooks , one of at least twelve articles so far , all of them filed after our rounds in the nearest garbage can . William and I suffered in silence ; it was all we could do , there was a gunner on every rotation . Helen Weyman was the next patient on our rounds . She was a fifty-two-year-old woman complaining of chest pain who had a history of cervical disc disease . I had done Helen 's workup when she was admitted to the hospital the previous afternoon . I went over her progress notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customary that the attending physician took over once the group entered the patient 's room ; it was our time to stand back and learn , but I felt it was important to greet my patients first . " Good morning , Helen , " I said , standing at her side . " I see your daughter was able to bring your knitting to you . Now you 're not so bored , I hope . " Dr. Goetz glanced at me . " What are you making ? " I asked . " A baby blanket for my next grandchild ... number three . I 've made a blanket for all of them . She 's due in the next week or two . " I picked up the blanket and turned it over in my hands . " You 've even got her name in here ! " I sensed Dr. Goetz waiting for me to finish . " Let 's go ahead and take a listen to your heart again this morning . " I listened to her heart and felt for her pulse . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to listen to your heart today as well . " I moved away from the bed . Dr. Goetz took my place and examined her . As he did , he asked her about all her grandchildren , where they lived , how long she 'd been married , and if she 'd make him a pair of slippers . She laughed , and I watched as Dr. Goetz won over yet another patient . Before leaving the room I squeezed Helen 's shoulder and told her I 'd be by later to check on her . I walked with William toward the cafeteria for lunch when my pager went off . I walked to Helen 's room . The baby blanket was still sitting on her lap . Her daughter Mary , looking very pregnant and uncomfortable , was sitting in the chair next to the bed . " Is everything all right , Helen ? " I asked . She leaned forward and rubbed her hand over her lower back . " My back has been hurting . " I helped Helen into a more comfortable position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be putting pressure on those discs in your back . Does that feel better ? " She paused for a moment . " Yes , thank you , I think it helped . " " So you do n't think it 's anything serious ? " Mary asked . " No , it may be just some inflammation around those discs . But we should rule out any other possibilities , " I said , handing the knitting back to Helen . " How much longer before this is done ? " " Just a couple more days , I think , " she said , taking the needles in her hand . I left her room and went to the nurses ' station to discuss follow-up with the nurse on duty and to page one of the residents when Mary came rushing from her mother 's room . " My mother needs help ! " A nurse ran past me and headed to Helen 's room . I followed close behind . I had just stepped inside when the nurse called in a loud , firm voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hallway , right outside Helen 's door , feeling helpless as Peter wheeled Helen to the OR .
