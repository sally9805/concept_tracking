Death in Paradise , Chapter One One out . A left-handed hitter with an inside-out swing . The ball would slice away from him toward third . Jesse took a step to his right . The next pitch was inside and chest high and the batter yanked it down the first baseline , over the bag and into the right-field corner , had there been a corner , and lumbered into second base without a throw . " I saw you move into the hole , " the batter said to Jesse . " Foiled again , Paulie . " They played three nights a week under the lights on the west side of town beside a lake , wearing team tee shirts and hats . One umpire . No stealing . No spikes allowed . Officially it was the Paradise Men 's Softball League , but Jesse often thought of it as the Boys of Evening . The next batter was right-handed and Jesse knew he pulled everything .

Hanging around in the late twilight after a ball game drinking club soda just did n't work . But booze was too easy for Jesse . It went down too gently , made him feel too integrated . Jesse felt that it was n't seemly for the police chief to get publicly hammered . So he had learned in the last few years to approach it very carefully . The talk was of double plays , and games played long ago , and plays at the plate , and sex . Talk of sex and baseball was the best of all possible talk . Jesse sipped a little of the beer . Beer from an ice-filled cooler was the best way for beer to be . From the edge of the lake a voice said , " Jesse , get over here . " The voice was scared . Carrying a can of Lite beer , Jesse walked to the lakeside . Two men were squatting on their heels at the edge of the water .
