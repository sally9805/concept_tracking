First Inning Mom and Pete gave it a rest as they got their packs and Quilla 's wicker plant-collection basket out of the van 's back end ; Pete even helped Trisha get her pack settled evenly on her back , tightening one of the straps , and she had a moment 's foolish hope that now things were going to be all right . " Kids got your ponchos ? " Mom asked , looking up at the sky . There was still blue up there , but the clouds were thickening in the west . It very likely would rain , but probably not soon enough for Pete to have a satisfying whine about being soaked . " I 've got mine , Mom ! " Trisha chirruped in her **25;777;TOOLONG voice . Pete grunted something that might have been yes . " Lunches ? " Affirmative from Trisha ; another low grunt from Pete . " Good , because I 'm not sharing mine . " She locked the Caravan , then led them across the dirt lot toward a sign marked TRAIL WEST , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cars in the lot , all but theirs with out-of-state plates . " Bug-spray ? " Mom asked as they stepped onto the path leading to the trail . " Trish ? " " Got it ! " she chirruped , not entirely positive she did but not wanting to stop with her back turned so that Mom could have a rummage . That would get Pete going again for sure . If they kept walking , though , he might see something which would interest him , or at least distract him . A raccoon . Maybe a deer . A dinosaur would be good . Trisha giggled . " What 's funny ? " Mom asked . " Just me thinks , " Trisha replied , and Quilla frowned  --  " me thinks " was a Larry McFarland-ism . Well let her frown , Trisha thought . Let her frown all she wants , I 'm with her , and I do n't complain about it liNKING . PLEASE FILL PRIMER JUG FOR NEXT PERSON . She had a bottle of water in her pack  --  a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world was to prime the pump in the little hut and get a drink , cold and fresh , from its rusty lip . She would drink and pretend she was Bilbo Baggins , on his way to the Misty Mountains . " Mom ? " she asked from behind them . " Could we stop long enough to  --  " " Making friends is a job , Peter , " her mother was saying . She did n't look back at Trisha . " You ca n't just stand around and wait for kids to come to you . " " Mom ? Pete ? Could we Please stop for just a  --  " " You do n't understand , " he said heatedly . " You do n't have a clue . I do n't know how things were when you were in junior high , but they 're a lot different now . " " Pete ? Mom ? Mommy ? There 's a pump  --  " Actually there was a pump ; that was now the grammatically correct way to put it , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . " I do n't accept that , " Mom said briskly , all business , and Trisha thought : No wonder she drives him crazy . Then , resentfully : They do n't even know I 'm here , The Invisible Girl , that 's me . I might as well have stayed home . A mosquito whined in her ear and she slapped at it irritably . They came to a fork in the trail . The main branch  --  not quite as wide as an avenue now , but still not bad  --  went off to the left , marked by a sign reading NO . CONWAY 5.2 . The other branch , smaller and mostly overgrown , read KEZAR NOTCH 10 . " Guys , I have to pee , " said The Invisible Girl , and of course neither of them took any notice ; they just headed up the branch which led to North Conway , walking side by side like l overs and looking into each other 's faces like lovers and arguing like the bitterest enemies . We should have stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , and I could have read a book . The Hobbit again , maybe  --  a story about guys who like to walk in the woods . " Who cares , I 'm peeing , " she said sulkily , and walked a little way down the path marked KEZAR NOTCH . Here the pines which had stayed modestly back from the main trail crowded in , reaching with their blueblack branches , and there was underbrush , as well  --  clogs and clogs of it . She looked for the shiny leaves that meant poison ivy , poison oak , or poison sumac , and did n't see any ... thank God for small favors . Her mother had shown her pictures of those and taught her to identify them two years ago , when life had been happier and simpler . In those days Trisha had gone tramping in the woods with her mother quite a bit . ( Pete 's bitterest complaint about the trip to Plant-A-Torium was that their mother had wanted to go there . The obvious truth of this seemed to blind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day long . ) On one of their walks , Mom had also taught her how girls peed in the woods . She began by saying , " The most important thing  --  maybe the only important thing  --  is not to do it in a patch of poison ivy . Now look . Watch me and do it just the way I do it . " Trisha now looked both ways , saw no one , and decided she 'd get off the trail anyway . The way to Kezar Notch looked hardly used  --  little more than an alley compared to the broad thoroughfare of the main trail  --  but she still did n't want to squat right in the middle of it . It seemed indecorous . She stepped off the path in the direction of the North Conway fork , and she could still hear them arguing . Later on , after she was good and lost and trying not to believe she might die in the woods , Trisha would remember the last phrase she got in the clear ; her brother 's hurt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for what you guys did wrong ! She walked half a dozen steps toward the sound of his voice , stepping carefully around a clump of brambles even though she was wearing jeans instead of shorts . She paused , looked back , and realized she could still see the Kezar Notch path ... which meant that anyone coming along it would be able to see her , squatting and peeing with a half-loaded knapsack on her back and a Red Sox cap on her head . Em-bare-ASS-ing , as Pepsi might say ( Quilla Andersen had once remarked that Penelope Robichaud 's picture should be next to the word vulgar in the dictionary ) . Trisha went down a mild slope , her sneakers slipping a little in a carpet of last year 's dead leaves , and when she got to the bottom she could n't see the Kezar Notch path anymore . Good . From the other direction , straight ahead through the woods , she heard a man 's voice and a girl 's answering laughter  --  hikers on the main trail , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her jeans it occurred to her that if her mother and brother paused in their oh-so-interesting argument , looking behind them to see how sis was doing , and saw a strange man and woman instead , they might be worried about her . Good ! Give them something else to think about for a few minutes . Something besides themselves . The trick , her mother had told her on that better day in the woods two years ag o , was n't going outdoors  --  girls could do that every bit as well as boys  --  but to do it without soaking your clothes . Trisha held onto the conveniently jutting branch of a nearby pine , bent her knees , then reached between her legs with her free hand , yanking her pants and her underwear forward and out of the firing line . For a moment nothing happened  --  was n't that just typical  --  and Trish sighed . A mosquito whined bloodthirstily around her left ear , and she had no hand free with which to slap at it . " Oh waterless cookware ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite deliciously stupid and funny , and she began to laugh . As soon as she started laughing she started peeing . When she was done she looked around dubiously for something to blot with and decided  --  once more it was her father 's phrase  --  not to push her luck . She gave her tail a little shake ( as if that would really do any good ) and then yanked up her pants . When the mosquito buzzed the side of her face again , she slapped it briskly and looked with satisfaction at the small bloody smear in the cup of her palm . " Thought I was unloaded , partner , did n't you ? " she said . Trisha turned back toward the slope , and then turned around again as the worst idea of her life came to her . This idea was to go forward instead of backtracking to the Kezar Notch trail . The paths had forked in a Y ; she would simply walk across the gap and rejoin the main trail . Piece of cake . There was no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other hikers so clearly . There was really no chance of getting lost at all .
