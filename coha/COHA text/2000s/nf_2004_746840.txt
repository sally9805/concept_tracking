Section : SKy eveNtS <p> As Earth 's Northern Hemisphere continues its long descent toward winter , observers rejoice in the extra hours available for sky-gazing  --  while simultaneously cursing the extra layers of clothing needed to spend time outdoors . Fortunately , this autumn provides a galaxy of celestial delights guaranteed to ward off the chill . <p> The action starts slowly after the Sun goes down , then builds rapidly as dawn approaches . The first planet to appear after sunset is Mercury . This apparition does n't rank among Mercury 's best : at greatest eastern elongation on 20 November , the planet appears only 5 high in the southwest 30 minutes after sunset . Still , Mercury shines brightly , at magnitude - 0.3 , so those with sharp eyes and a clear horizon should be able to spot it . Binoculars will help the search . If you point a telescope toward Mercury at greatest elongation , expect to see a 7 ? - diameter disk a bit more than half-lit . <p> Once Mercury disappears , the sky remains devoid of bright planets until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after midnight in early October , but pokes above the horizon around 10 p.m. in early November and at 8 p.m. by month 's end . You can find it among the stars of eastern Gemini , roughly 10 south of the 1st-magnitude stars Castor and Pollux . At magnitude 0.0 , however , Saturn appears significantly brighter than the two stars . <p> The view of Saturn through a telescope stands beyond compare . Even the smallest telescope reveals the glorious rings , which span 41 ? in early October and 45 ? by late November . You should be able to spy the dark gap that separates the outer A ring from the brighter B ring . With a good 6-inch or larger scope , you might glimpse the dusky , innermost C ring . This autumn proves to be a particularly good time to view Saturn because the planet casts its shadow on the rings , giving the system a stunning three-dimensional appearance . <p> Unless you plan a long night under the stars , you 'll be best off waking early to view the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight begins . <p> In early October , it appears nearly a third of the way up in the east an hour before sunrise . There 's no mistaking Venus  --  at magnitude - 4.1 , it easily outshines every other object in the night sky except the Moon . <p> The view of Venus through a telescope does n't change as rapidly as it did this past spring and summer . At the start of October , the planet displays a 16 ? - diameter disk that 's slightly more than two-thirds lit . By the end of November , its disk has shrunk to 12 ? across while its phase has waxed to nearly 90% lit . <p> As autumn progresses , Venus falls toward the horizon . But its diminishing altitude has a beneficial effect , bringing Venus closer to Jupiter . On 1 November , Venus lies just 4 above Jupiter . That gap closes to less than a degree  --  a little more than the diameter of the Moon  --  on the 4th and 5th . ( On the 4th , Venus appears just above Jupiter ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pales in comparison to Venus , it still dazzles at magnitude - 1.7 . Whether you 're a novice observer or a seasoned veteran , seeing the two brightest planets next to each other never fails to impress . <p> On the 4th and 5th , you can view Venus and Jupiter in the same low-power field of view . Jupiter appears 32 ? across , about 2 1/2 times the diameter of Venus . Jupiter also shows more detail in the eyepiece . You should see two dark , parallel belts , one on either side of the planet 's equator . <p> After the conjunction , Jupiter continues to climb higher while Venus dips lower . As Venus descends , it approaches ruddy Mars , slowly returning to view after months behind the Sun . On 30 November , Venus stands 3 above Mars . At magnitude 1.7 , Mars ca n't hold a candle to Venus  --  or Jupiter for that matter . The Red Planet looks like a modestly bright star . A Last Look at Totality <p> The color orange seems most at home during October . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery displays , but festive pumpkins decorate front porches across America . This year promises an additional exhibition in orange , when the Moon slides into Earth 's shadow on the night of October 27/28 . <p> For observers in most of the Americas , this will be their third chance to view totality in the last 17 months . But do n't let that fool you into thinking the event is common . This is the last view of totality anywhere in the world until March 2007 . The eclipse begins when the Full Moon enters the lighter , outer part of Earth 's shadow , called the penumbra , at 8:06 p.m . EDT on the 27th . You wo n't notice much at first , but within 30 to 45 minutes , the western edge of the Moon should appear darker . The Moon enters the darker , inner portion of Earth 's shadow at 9:14 p.m . EDT . At first , the shadow will look black in contrast to the rest of the Moon , which remains in sunlight . But as more of the Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take on an orange hue . <p> The color arises because sunlight reaching the Moon has passed through Earth 's atmosphere . The air scatters blue light and leaves only redder hues  --  the same reason sunrises and sunsets appear reddish . The atmosphere also acts like a lens , bending the colored sunlight into Earth 's shadow . <p> Totality commences at 10:23 p.m . EDT and lasts for 81.3 minutes . The southern limb of the Moon passes deeper into the shadow , so expect it to look darker than the northern limb . After totality ends at 11:45 p.m . EDT , the stages of the eclipse play out in reverse . The Moon exits the umbral shadow at 12:54 a.m . EDT and the penumbral phase concludes at 2:03 a.m . EDT .
