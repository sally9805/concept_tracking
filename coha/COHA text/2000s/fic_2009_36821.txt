In the sweep of the headlights , the house on the hill looked like a gaudy mansion dating from California 's gold rush era . I felt a surge of exhilaration . I could imagine the view of the mighty Pacific I 'd have in the morning from windows overlooking the cliffs . And the thought of crumbling plaster around the panes got my blood pumping . Digging my teeth into this place would make the perfect distraction . <p> Chunks of heaving cement led to an old-fashioned carport at one side of the home . The vehicle pulled behind an older model Honda and stopped . <p> The driver cut the engine and touched my arm . " Despite her appearance , Ms. Rigg helps where she can . Please do n't undermine her desire . " He held my gaze for an extra beat , an Einstein look-alike with his shaggy white hair and Coke-bottle glasses . The lab-coat look with mix-n-match clothes beneath screamed " permanently out to lunch . " He got out of the vehicle and disappeared inside . <p> Relief swept over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car together on and off for the past seventy-two hours . And while Professor Denton Braddock obviously meant well with his endless stream of words to the wise , I felt like a four-year-old trapped in Mr. Rogers ' neighborhood . <p> A blast of pain shot up my arm . The moist ocean air with its tinge of salt seemed to add to the agony . I rubbed at the bandage that extended from elbow to shoulder , ready for another painkiller . I grabbed at the handle with my good arm and opened the car door . <p> A single bulb dangled above me in the weathered porch area . Shadows shrank and grew as the stiff breeze sent the light scuttling . I shivered , though the early summer evening was balmy . <p> I stared at the entry to my newest renovation project and sighed . Fixing up houses and selling them for a profit had been my living for much of the past decade . But I 'd intended to make the log cabin back in the deep woods of Michigan my final project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the redneck mafia , I had to live with Plan B-at least until I could return home and make my dream a reality . <p> Ahead , warped steps led up to a screen door and into the house . I put a foot on the bottom tread . This was the first time I 'd arrived at a renovation empty-handed . No cot . No sleeping bag . No coffeemaker . No tools . No Goodwill bargains . No identification . <p> Just the clothes on my back . I even had to live under another name while I hid out in Del Gloria . No more Patricia Louise Amble , the name on my birth certificate . I was now Alisha Marie Braddock , the professor 's supposed niece visiting from Galveston . <p> " Why Galveston ? " I 'd asked him somewhere between Minnesota and Wyoming . <p> " I like how it sounds . " <p> " I 've never been to Galveston , " I said . <p> " Then you ca n't give any details about your previous life , can you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from great romantic possibilities with Brad back in Rawlings in order to dig into my past . I had n't felt right starting a relationship when I could n't give an intelligent account of my ancestry . According to Denton , I was now supposed to brush off any questions that would give clues to my identity . <p> I scuffed across the porch and through the screen door . It slammed behind me . <p> Beyond an entryway , I found the kitchen , tall and narrow with cupboards stretching beyond human reach along two walls . A library ladder would have been at home in the galley layout . <p> Far overhead , two bulbs cast a dim light on the room . The cream-colored walls seemed in perfect condition . The finish on the dark cabinetry shone to a high gloss , without a fingerprint in sight . I ran my hand along a cool stone countertop . Though clearly a replacement , the flawless surface looked original to the home . All in all , a remarkable restoration job . <p> I crossed my arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this hideout , he 'd assured me that Denton was offering food and shelter in exchange for my restoration skills . I could only assume the rest of the house , minus the kitchen , needed my expert touch . <p> The thought of Brad delivered a new dose of pain , starting at my heart and radiating to every limb . <p> A door swung open at one end of the room . <p> " Welcome , Miss Braddock , " said a woman 's voice . <p> Remembering my name change , I stood to attention at the brisk Irish accent . <p> " I 'm Ms. Rigg . " She spoke the title as if Mizz was her given name as she shuffled into the light . " Do you need help with your bags or can you get them yourself ? " <p> Ms. Rigg was a tiny woman wearing a black cotton dress over black socks and black sneakers . White legs poked out beneath her hem with each step . As she drew closer , I realized her small stature could be attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as high as the top of her head . <p> I tried not to stare . " No . I 'm fine . I have no bags . " <p> " Then what about food ? You must be hungry . " <p> I focused my mind on my stomach . It growled on cue . " Food would be great . Thanks . " <p> The words seemed to trip a switch . The woman moved with purpose to the stove and lifted the lid on an oversized pot . " Beef stew . The professor 's favorite . " <p> Steam billowed as she stirred . The succulent scent of juicy tomatoes and spice filled the air . <p> " Mmmm . Smells delicious . " I liked the thought of a built-in cook during my stay in Del Gloria . <p> She plopped the lid back and retrieved a stepping stool from a corner of the kitchen . She set it down near the sink , climbed up , and pulled open a cabinet . Even with the added height , she struggled to reach the bowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here . Let me help with those . " Just a smidge under six feet , my height came in handy in the restoration business . Those hard-to-reach corners were easy for me . Long arms , long neck , long legs ... I either resembled a supermodel or an ostrich . <p> The fingers of my good arm barely touched the smooth ceramic bowls before Ms. Rigg swatted me away . <p> " Do n't you be interfering in my kitchen . " Her voice rose to shrill peaks . " It 's bad enough the professor agreed to take you in . Barely through the door and you think you own the place . " Gray hair in a bun shook loose with her anger . " Well , you do n't own it yet . Relation or not , you 'll not be taking my place in this house . " <p> I recoiled at her words . " I 'm sorry . I just meant to help . And please , do n't worry about me . I 'm not really- " <p> The far door swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strode in . For a moment he seemed strong and decisive , not the awkward nerd-type I 'd ridden here with . <p> He took me by the arm . I winced at the pressure on my bandage . <p> " I 'm showing Alisha to her room . She can help herself to stew later . " Denton led me out of the kitchen . We stopped just outside the door . <p> He turned me toward him , showing no mercy to my wound . " Heed my words . You will not survive if anyone suspects you are not who I say you are . " <p> I shook off his grip . " Sorry . " I cradled my arm . " She got so defensive . I did n't want her thinking I was here permanently . " <p> " Perhaps you are here permanently . We wo n't know for some time . " His lips pursed under a bushy moustache as he started to walk . " I warned you about Ms. Rigg . I specifically asked you not to help her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parting words in the car . " I had no idea she 'd be so offended . " <p> He halted at the foot of a grand staircase . " Now you know . Do n't help unless she asks . " <p> I stared at a mole on his cheek . Denton certainly offered asylum-as in loony bin , not sanctuary . What had Brad been thinking ? When I found the body in my basement two projects ago , the killer had been behind bars within six months . Could I last around here for six months ? <p> I sighed and followed Denton up the stairs . It was n't as if I had a choice . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
