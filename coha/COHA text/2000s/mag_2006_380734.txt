Martina Navratilova must have a secret . The rivals of her youth have moved on  --  into retirement , onto highlight reels , up to the TV booth . Yet Navratilova , the tennis great who will turn 50 in October , is still whipping forehands past players who had n't been born yet when she started on the pro tour in 1972 . With her unusual endurance have come questions  --  lots of them . " The longer I play and the older I get , " she says , " the more I get ' Why are you still doing this ? How can you do it so well ? ' " <P> So ? " There is no secret , no silver bullet , " says Navratilova . " Everybody can do it . " That means you  --  flabby you , middle-aged you , gym-loathing you  --  can get into shape and , like Navratilova , stay in shape . After years of giving advice ad hoc , Navratilova has written a book explaining how . In Shape Your Self , Navratilova argues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require physical pain and joining a health club is n't necessary to get results . The bottom line , she says , is " you have no excuse to not get fit . " <P> Navratilova did not get to the top by making excuses . She has won 167 pro singles titles  --  more than any other player , man or woman  --  and 175 doubles titles , including one last year , when she paired with Germany 's Anna-Lena Groenefeld , 20 , to win the Canadian Open . The oldest player on the women 's tour , Navratilova plans to play a full doubles schedule this year  --  and improve on her showing at last year 's Grand Slams , in which she reached the doubles semifinals of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open . She says she may even play singles " on the grass "  --  at Wimbledon , which she has won a record nine times  --  " if the body 's feeling good and the game 's up to it . " <P> As you may expect from someone in the fourth decade of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The quick-fix mentality , she says , is what 's wrong with how a lot of folks approach fitness . " You ca n't feel like you have to drastically change your life overnight , " she says . " People make resolutions , especially at New Year 's . They last two weeks . " The enthusiasm may be well intentioned , but the plan is usually not well executed . " They get excited . ' I 'm going to the gym ! ' " she says . " Then they totally overdo it . They are exhausted and sore , and that 's the end of it . " <P> Her plan is based on baby steps . " If you do things incrementally , you have a much better chance of succeeding , " she says . Navratilova 's approach is commonsensical and holistic , focusing on a strong mind and spirit as well as on the body . Of the six steps in her plan ( see box ) , only one focuses on physical exercise . Her healthy menus feature dishes like guacamole wraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a 1-oz. serving of cheese is described as the size of a lipstick tube ) and not too restrictive ( they include ingredients that other diets would deem indulgent , like maple syrup and grated Asiago cheese ) . She also emphasizes mental exercise . For example , to sharpen your focus , she advises keeping a journal . " You have to feel on the inside that you want to make this change , " she says . <P> As for physical exercise , she 's a myth buster when it comes to the notion of no pain , no gain . " You do n't have to suffer in order to feel great and look great , " she insists . " You do n't have to run sprints or do suicides on a basketball court in under 30 seconds . "
