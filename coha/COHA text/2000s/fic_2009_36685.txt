The Blue Notebook <br> <br> I have a break now . Mamaki Briila is pleased with me and she should be ! I have worked hard all morning and now that I tell her I am tired , she smiles at me . " Rest , little Batuk , " she says . " Today will be brimming with riches . " Actually , I am not tired at all . <br> My name is Batuk . I am a fifteen-year-old girl nested in the Common Street in Mumbai . I have been here six years and I have been blessed with beauty and a pencil . My beauty comes from within . The pencil came from the ear of Mamaki Briila , who is my boss . <br> I saw the pencil fall from Mamaki 's ear two nights ago . I had just made sweet-cake and she bustled into my nest with an immense smile , leaned over , pinched my cheek , and kissed the top of my head . As she bent over , the giant sacs of her breasts were thrown in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat between them . She smelled like us , but worse . <br> She had to hold her back and lurch to get upright again , and as she did her breasts swayed as if they were pets hanging from her neck , dancing . She pulled the pencil from behind her ear and withdrew a palm-sized yellow notebook from an inner fold of her sari ( or maybe her skin ) . As she opened the book , she peered down at me and another smile spread over her red face like water soaking into dry stone . She made a pencil mark in her book with a flourish of her bloated hand . She said sweetly , " Little Batuk , you are my favorite girl . I thought you were going to disappoint me tonight but in just an hour , you have made me love you . " I am sure she was about to remind me of her thousand kindnesses to me but she was interrupted by a shriek from Puneet . <br> Puneet is my best friend and occupies the nest two down from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries every time she makes sweet-cake . Puneet only cries when he has to and the shriek he emitted that moment could have split rock . It was a single piercing yell , not of bodily pain , because Puneet feels no pain , but of terror . Mamaki knew this too . Puneet is the most valuable of us all because he is a boy . <br> Puneet 's scream killed the night silence of the street and the smile dropped from Mamaki 's face like a coin falling to the ground . She turned her street-wide rear in my face and fled from my nest . I was impressed that an object set on earth as she is can move with such speed , when it has to . As she flew from my nest , the tails of her sari caught the breeze and reminded me of the sheets used to protect the crops from the summer sun . That is when the pencil slipped from behind Mamaki 's ear , lubricated by her unique brand of body oil . <br> In Mamaki 's wake , the pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of times , and then stopped moving . I sprang from my bed and threw myself upon it . The pencil was mine by divine decree . <br> I lay upon the small object , silent and motionless . My mind went back to when I was a little girl in Dreepah-Jil , my home village . I would perch on a rock in the sun , sometimes for hours , even in the heat of midday , and imagine myself melting into the rock . Eventually from between the rocks or through the grass would scamper a little lizard . With its quick tight movements , it would look around and see nothing moving and feel safe . The lizard would relax and sun itself below my rock or sometimes even on it . I would not move , even if it sat right next to me . I would control my breathing and melt deeper into the rock until I became stone . I used my mind to control the mind of the lizard . I would speak soothingly to the lizard through the upper air . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> You can look upward and see a raindrop that is destined to hit you . You see it , you know it is falling ever faster , and you know it will hit you , but you can not escape it . So it was for the lizard . As I sprang upon the lizard , we might lock eyes for a hair of a moment . Then I would land on it , sometimes with so much force that I would kill it ; if so , such was its fate . As I lay on the stone floor of my nest , I had a pencil because that too was fate . <br> I got off the floor , climbed onto my throne , lay down with the pencil under my belly , and fell asleep . When I awoke in the morning , the pencil was where I had left it but it had become warmed by my dreams . I lay in the first light with my eyes fluttering awake and asleep as I gazed through the entrance to my nest . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write away my life , but there was enough to start . <br> My break and my faked tiredness are nearly over . In a moment I will replace this writing book inside the rip I made in my mattress . Today as I lie making sweet-cake , I will feel it against my back and know that it is there . <br> You should have heard Mamaki that night when she ran into Puneet 's nest at the speed of gunfire . Her scream was almost as loud as Puneet 's had been . His had been an expression of terror whereas hers was meant to generate it . There had been two servants paying homage together to Prince Puneet when the commotion erupted , a practice that is entirely acceptable to Mamaki if the gifts to the prince are correctly apportioned . In this case , the gifts were of less importance as the devotees were two high-ranking police officers . Although they had initially undertaken the acts of baking ( I heard Mamaki bless the visitors when they arrived ) , things got out of hand . Puneet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw the officers into the Common Street with one massive shove . Pah ! to the officers . As I watched them from my nest , they got up , brushed the dust off their tan uniforms , laughed like brothers , and ambled away into the night . One of them had his police stick dangling from his wrist . Puneet fell to the ground from it -- drip , drip , drip -- as if the earth needed to feed on Puneet just as they had done . <br> Forgive me , please , for I am being dramatic . This is not only because Puneet is my beloved but also because I have a sense of drama . Mother always scolded me for this , perhaps because my playacting delighted Father so . When the family was together I would put on shows . I would mimic Navrang , the village lunatic , or Uncle Vishal ( " Uncle V " ) , who was so fat he fell asleep in his soup . Mother would shake her head in grumbling disapproval whereas Father would laugh until he cried . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reward for my drama , Father would take me into his arms and , if I begged him , he would tell me the story of the silver-eyed leopard . Every rendition had different embellishments and the story could last for hours , depending on how tired Father was or whether I fell asleep . <br> I loved my story . On some nights , I would pretend to be asleep when Mother walked through the bedroom filled with my brothers , sisters , and cousins . If I was still awake when Father returned from the fields and from the woman with the lavender scent , I would rush to him , fold myself in his lap , and beg him to tell me my story . " Not tonight , Batuk , " he would often say as I cuddled into him and felt the vibration in his chest as he spoke . Twenty minutes or so later , as he brushed the last rice off his mouth , he would invariably give in and start telling me the story to my whoops of delight . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puneet has been ill but Mamaki says he is recovering . Between baking classes , I call to him two nests down and he calls back . Initially , Hippopotamus ( this is how we secretly refer to Mamaki ) forbade our volleys of chatter during work hours , but soon she realized that it lifts Puneet 's spirits and now allows it . <br> Puneet is not yet ready to bake with us . If Puneet is so injured that he can not work with us , or if he dies , then who will be there for me ? I suppose that is a selfish way of thinking , but such is the whim of the dramatic soul . <br> * <br> There is a short break . Mr. Floppy Ears baked only the smallest sweet-cake with me . I can hardly claim to be tired . <br> I write in pencil . So how do I sharpen it , you ask ? I smile at you . Not my " come and adore me " smile but a sly smile . I sharpen my pencil with the quickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest is the Street of Thieves . Here you can buy everything from an airplane to a cloak that makes you invisible -- or that 's what they say . One of the barrow boys who carts goods to and from the Street of Thieves I call Bandu . Bandu the barrow boy passes in front of my nest at least twice a day . I know when he is coming because the barrow 's wheel is steel and it makes a terrible racket , which I can hear from streets away . In the early morning , when he passes by , his barrow brims over with bits and pieces , and in the evening when he returns , the wooden box is almost empty . There are occasions too when he makes extra trips , presumably for special deliveries . <br> Bandu is about my age and fine to look at . Even over the last year he has become more masculine and taller . He has large oval eyes that stare at me every day and , without fail , stare away whenever I catch his gaze . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <br> As my pencil became blunt I , the sly girl that I am , started smiling more avidly at him . I would tilt my head and show my lips . As I ensnared him to my will -- like the lizard -- his stare would linger and sometimes he would hold my gaze for a full second . On occasion , his eyes flicked , like the lizard 's tongue , to my thighs or my small breasts . I sat in my nest as I had sat on my rock many years earlier , waiting for the barrow boy to sun himself under my shadow . He began to slow down as he approached my nest , and a few days later he grunted at me in that primal way shy men do . <br> After three days of grunting and my feigned embarrassment , I beckoned him to me . My gate 's lock does not drop until after Hippo 's first morning tea and cake , but I lowered my head below his , looked at him through my locked gate , and said , " My name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I paused and smiled . " You could get me a sharpener for my pencil . " <br> I was a little annoyed that he took a full two days to bring the sharpener to me . But when he did return , late , after Hippo 's third tea , with it clasped in his street-worn hand , I smiled as if he had brought me a ruby . I then kissed him . There was no gate between us . I had intended to peck him on the cheek because I felt that was all he deserved , but instead I kissed him straight on the mouth . I searched my tongue for his and felt his tongue flee to the back of his mouth like a cowering dog about to be beaten . He started to push his tongue forward to meet mine , but I thrust him away with both my arms . This whole exchange of thanks took less than a few seconds but I knew that my taste would linger in his mouth all day . His want of me would soak his mind for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I behaved in such a disgraceful manner , but I have my pencil sharpener and I never spoke to or acknowledged Bandu the barrow boy again . <br> * <br> The doctor came again yesterday to see Puneet and left after only ten minutes . This is probably because of the stench of Mamaki at close quarters and because Mamaki only pays a quarter of the doctor 's fee . This doctor comes here frequently , though , Princess Meera being his first choice when it comes to topping off his bill . <br> The news from the doctor was good . It is only four days after Puneet 's visit from the policemen and he is free from danger . I knew that I was being overdramatic ! On a break , I leaned out of the entrance of my nest and called to Puneet , as I have been doing constantly , knowing that he is not working . He called back to say that he feels his strength returning . He did not want to say that he feels good because I know he fears the ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as possible . <br> Puneet will soon mature to manhood and I can see this in his body . His shoulders are becoming defined and his muscles more obvious . His thighs are bulging more and there are a few hairs on his shiny chest . His voice occasionally crackles . Although we have laughed about this we both know what it means . Soon a decision will need to be made about Puneet and he will not be the one to make it . <br> If Puneet is to lose his bhunnas they will need to do it soon ( I thought that while the doctor was here , they would go right ahead and do it ) . If he is allowed to enter manhood , they will need to train his bhunnas and give him a new style . It is possible that as a man he may become more beautiful but there is also a chance he would become ugly and in that case he would need to be discarded . My vote would be to remove his bhunnas now . He will then always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there for me . There is no one who can make me laugh as hard as Puneet . <br> Regardless of what transpires , Puneet 's eyes will be constant . I have looked into his eyes and there I see his laughter and his mockery of the nest , Hippopotamus , and the Common Street . As I stare deeper into him , I watch his disdain for those who adore him and a red splash of evil . Deeper still , I see a bottomless well of cool water that is love . <br> Continues ...
