It 's unusual to talk about someone who makes TV movies as having themes , a voice , an oeuvre . Scratch that : it 's unusual to talk about someone who makes TV movies , period . Yet within this undersung field , writer-director Jane Anderson has wrought a body of wry and poignant work about women and power . Her 1993 The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader Murdering Mom for HBO won her a writing Emmy and helped define a kind of off-kilter , fact-based drama that has become a pay-cable staple . Showtime 's 1998 The Baby Dance , about the class tension between a wealthy couple and the couple whose unborn baby they 're going to adopt , and her segment of last year 's HBO If These Walls Could Talk 2 , with Vanessa Redgrave as an elderly lesbian legally dispossessed when her lover dies , were tough-minded triumphs . <P> So Anderson , 45 , was a natural choice to tell the story of the 1973 battle-of-the-sexes tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs . Except , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about tennis . " ( She did , however , have access to King , whom she 'd known through mutual friends for years . And for insurance , she took tennis lessons . " I consider myself a Method writer-director , " she jokes . ) But When Billie Beat Bobby ( ABC , April 16 , 9 p.m . E.T. ) is n't really a tennis movie , just as the King-Riggs face-off was n't memorable as tennis ( she creamed him , in straight sets ) . When more than 40 million watched the lobbin ' libber play the fast-talking former pro turned hustler , the big-top spectacle brought feminism into the living room . <P> A typical TV movie might have shown the match reverently as an Important Social Moment . But Anderson  --  whose Cheerleader was a pitch-perfect rendering of a modern tabloid circus  --  also captures the made-for-TV ridiculousness of its buildup , from Riggs ' shilling for Sugar Daddy caramel pops to the opponents ' theatrical , Muhammad Ali-esque bouts of insult and braggadocio . For these outsize personalities , the sideshow was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment as well as a sport , " says Holly Hunter , who plays King and starred in Cheerleader . " That aspect of the story was really well served by Jane 's satirical style . " <P> With its A-list star and semisatirical tone , Billie feels more like a pay-cable project than a network movie-of-the-week . That is no accident . Cable networks have been stealing audience and awards from the networks through high-profile projects with big names and budgets , and the broadcast networks have turned to newsmagazine and reality shows , which deliver comparable audiences for less money than old-fashioned movies-of-the-week and offer similar dramas-in-real-life . But while ABC has cut back on movies , it has begun producing more high-profile " events , " including its Wonderful World of Disney and Oprah Winfrey Presents franchises , which have been among the few new network movies to score big ratings . " The old form of movie-of-the-week is n't appealing to audiences anymore , " says ABC executive vice president Susan Lyne . " The quality of cable movies has been a wake-up call . " Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rein  --  within language and time limits  --  to create Billie in her own style .
