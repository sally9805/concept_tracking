Ellen Steiber has written more than two dozen books for children , including a recent collaboration with Terri Windling , The Raven Queen . Her short fiction has appeared in several anthologies , Sirens , Ruby Slippers , Golden Tears , and The Armless Maiden , but this story marks her first magazine publication . " The Shape of Things " is a powerful fantasy . The Guatemalan folk tale retold here is an abbreviated version of " The Woman Charcotel , " which can be found in Mayan Folktales : Folklore from Lake Atitlan , Guatemala , where it is credited to Maria Ujpan Ramos . <p> NONIE TELLS ME SHE 'S GOING to die . " I 'm going to go out soon , " she says . She sounds perfectly casual , like she 's telling me she 's going to the store . " You 're crazy , " I say . She gives me this sad smile . " I wish . Look , I do n't know how it 's going to happen . Or when . I just know I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given to making dramatic pronouncements . Last year she told me that Mrs. Socorro , our tenth-grade English teacher , would pay for her sins . Mrs. Socorro got in a car accident that very weekend . Nonie had nothing to do with it . She was at some religious revival meeting her folks made her go to , but she said she had a feeling . That there was a dark aura - like a black halo - around Socorro 's head , and she saw trouble coming . Nonie can tell certain things like that . She sees things other people do n't . Ever since we met , when we were five , we 've played this game that Nonie made up . It 's called The Shape of Things , and what you do is try to see the shapes hidden inside . Like the first day we had Socorro , she was all smiles , telling us how exciting the English language was , how we were all going to explore it together . After that first class , Nonie asked me what sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and to me she was like a bouquet of fake flowers . All bright colors but nothing real . Nonie said , " She 's worse than that . Inside her there 's something dark , something that got born out of anger . She keeps it hidden , but you watch - it 'll be there in everything she says . " And it was . No one in our class got too excited about the English language , and Mrs. Socorro got mean . Even if she was complimenting you , there 'd be this put-down inside whatever she said . it took a while before I realized that whenever I came out of her class , I felt like there was something wrong with me . Like I was dirty . For a long time what I did n't see was that the shape inside her was hatred . Later , when I heard about Socorro 's car accident , I remembered what Nonie said about the black aura around her . And because I 'd had too much to drink when I heard the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to my older brother Patrick . But Patrick rolled his eyes and said , " Nonie 's just a drama queen with a taste for the Gothic . She could n't tell you what was inside a cupcake without making it sound dire . " " Well , it is , " I pointed out . " All those preservatives and chemicals and stuff . Eat enough cupcakes and you 'll get cancer . " " You know what I mean , " Patrick said . So even though Patrick is partly right , and I do n't want to encourage Nonie in all this death talk , I 'm afraid I might be missing something , so I say to her , " You 're not planning to off yourself , are you ? " Last year , three kids from Greenleigh , one of the schools we play in football , made some weird devil pact and then they all drank a lot of beer and shot themselves with their fathers " rifles . A lot of people have guns around here . " No , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Do I look suicidal to you ? " I look at her . Nonie 's pale and skinny , with long , straight brown hair , hazel eyes , and skin that 's broken out on her forehead . " You look the same as always , " I tell her . She gazes around us . We 're on the hill behind the high school , where we come to have a cigarette before going home . The hill is actually a mound of brown dirt . It used to have trees on it , but a developer razed it five years ago to put up a shopping center . The developer went bust and left us with this mound of dirt that looks down on the high school and the road into town . " I 'm going to miss this place , " Nonie says . " And that 's so weird . It never felt like the kind of place anyone would miss . " " Now I know you 're losing your mind . " I stamp out my cigarette and start down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . That stops me , because Nonie 's the type who never calls after anyone . She prefers you call after her . Her mother 's made a lifetime career of it , not that Nonie bothers to answer . Nonie considers her mother an inferior life form . " Okay . I give . " I turn around to face her . " What 's happening ? Are you sick ? " " Not that I know of . " She sits downs and wraps her arms around her knees . " I feel like always . School bores the hell out of me and I ca n't wait to get out , and then I do and everything else bores me , too . " " So ... you 're dying of boredom . " " Well , yeah , but no more than anyone else in this town . " She lies down flat on her back and stares up the sky . It 's been windy all day , and the clouds are traveling fast . " What 's the shape inside that big silvery one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say . " Dragon 's teeth , maybe , " she agrees . " Something that shreds you . " She sits up , and I notice that though she 's always been thin , she looks gaunt today , her skin almost transparent . " Cam , I 'm going to die . It 's not something I want or something I 'm planning . All I know is it 's going to happen soon . I want to give you my journals , " she says . " I do n't want my mother to go through them when I 'm dead . " That evening Nonie shows up at my house , carrying a cardboard box she can barely lift . I see her struggling with it as she comes up the walk . She has to set it down to ring the doorbell . By this time I 'm downstairs , opening the door . " What is that ? " " I told you , " she says . " My journals . " She opens the lid and sure enough , the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously . " Are you the only one home ? " " Yeah , my folks are at that town meeting , and Patrick 's over at Billy Hunter 's , taking apart his car . " I stare at the box . " You actually filled all these notebooks ? " She grins at me . One of her front teeth is a little longer than the others . it gives her this slightly crooked grin . " Socorro always told me I was wordy . Guess she was right . " I look through the box . On the cover of each notebook Nonie 's written her name , the word journal , and the dates she started and ended her entries . The earliest one goes back to second grade . " Nonie , if you do n't want your mom to read these things , why do n't you just bum " em ? That way they 'll be safe forever . " She smiles when I say that . " That 's a good way to think of it , " she tells me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . " All this talk of her imminent demise is starting to creep me out . Partly " cause she 's so sure , partly " cause she 's so calm , and partly " cause I seem to have a role to play in it . " You 're right , " she says . " We should bum " em . " She gives me that loopy grin . " Think your dad will mind if we make a bonfire in your front yard ? " " You know he 'd have a cardiac if he came home and saw a fire blazing away on our lawn . " My father is a fire fighter . " Besides ...... Somehow I ca n't bear the idea of Nonie being gone and me having burned all her journals . So we push the box up the stairs , and I 'm just grateful I 'm the only one home and do n't have to explain this to anyone . Nonie seems satisfied when we get the box under my desk . " Remember , " she tells me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetic she seems , do n't let her see these . " " I wo n't , " I say . " You 've got to swear . " " Nonie , you 're scaring me , " I tell her . " Swear it ! " So I swear to keep the journals away from her mom in the event of her death . And I make her promise to take the damn things back if she lives to be seventeen . FOR A FEW WEEKS nothing calamitous or dramatic happens . Nonie and I go to school , cut as many classes as we can get away with , smoke cigarettes on the hill . She does n't say anything more about dying , and I 'm figuring it 's lung cancer that will probably get us both . I also figure we still got some time on that one . I notice , though , that whenever we hang out Nonie starts humming this little tune . It 's not something that you hear on the radio or in music videos . " What is that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's familiar to me because I 've heard her hum it so many times or because it 's something I should recognize . She sings it quiet , but it 's got this relentless beat , likes it 's pushing something along . " Do n't know , " she tells me . " But I started hearing it in my mind right around the time I realized I was going to die . So I figure it 's the death song calling me . " " That 's it ! " I tell her . " You are giving me the willies ! I do n't want to hear any more about your premonitions or death chants " Death song , " I she corrects me . " Whatever . I do n't want to hear about it . " She takes a last drag on her cigarette and crushes it beneath her boot . " Fair enough , " she says . " I wo n't talk about it anymore . Talking ca n't change anything anyway . But I figured you knew . I figured you saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair on the back of my neck is standing straight up . " What change ? " " In my aura , " she says . " There always used to be this fine blue light around me . And bit by bit , it 's getting darker . Wo n't be long now before it goes black . " I look at her . She 's got her back to the setting sun , so there 's kind of a red glow in the sky behind her . Her voice sounds surprised when she says , " You do n't see it , do you ? " I shake my head . " I never could . I do n't even know if all these auras you 're always seeing are real . " " They 're real , all right , " she says so soft I can barely hear . " So this death of yours , " I try to keep my voice steady , " do you see a shape for it ? " I 'm imagining auto accidents , drive-by shootings , fires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weird thing , " she says . " I do . I mean , I have for a while , and it 's shaped like a big cat . " That actually calms me down . There are n't any big cats in this part of the state . We do n't even have a zoo . I figure for Nonie to get eaten by a big cat , she 'd have to hop a plane to Central America . She kicks at a piece of broken beer bottle on the ground . " I got a secret , " she says . " For a few weeks now . Want to hear it ? " I am wondering how I ever wound up with someone who 's so completely exasperating for a friend . " I am not going to pry it out of you , " I say . " Tell me if you want , or do n't . " Nonie starts to laugh . " I got a boyfriend , " she says , " areal , honest-togoodness boyfriend . " Turns out Nonie 's boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . No one really knows him well . Miguel not only keeps to himself , but every few weeks he up and disappears for a day . His homeroom teacher is always giving him lectures on truancy . Miguel is not the type you 'd think would go for someone as quiet as Nonie . Miguel 's beautiful . He 's got this thick , glossy , straight black hair that he wears down his back . He says he 's part Guatemalan , part Apache , part Swedish . The Swedish is a little hard to figure , but Nonie says it accounts for why he 's not fucked up about sex . Nonie and I both did it with boys as soon as we turned sixteen . Mostly to have it done and over with . Sex is not what I 'd call a big deal . Nonie 's theory is that most guys our age do n't really like sex , and they do n't even like girls . They just like the rush and they need to be able to brag about it later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's real gentle with her . Never rushes things . Loves being close after . Always makes sure she has as good a time as he does . Which is all a little surprising , considering Miguel 's rep . Even the gang members in our school , the ones who carry , keep a careful , respectful distance around Miguel . I always figured he must pack some major heat of his own , but Nonie says it 's not about that . It 's something inside him , something they know better than to go near . Nonie calls me up on Saturday morning and asks if I want to go to the quarry with her and Miguel . The quarry is one of the few decent things in this area . Years ago , they cut granite from the earth there . Since then it 's filled up with water . Of course , there are signs posted all over , telling you it 's private property , no trespassing and definitely no swimming , but it 's become the generally acknowledged swimming hole anyway . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to the quarry . He 's got an old pickup truck and we sit three across the front seat , Nonie wedged in between me and Miguel , and the two of us so close that our bare thighs stick together . It 's the first time I 've really hung out with Miguel . And I 'm curious about him but also self-conscious . I know it 's crazy , but I want Nonie 's boyfriend to think I 'm okay . We climb over the padlocked fence and walk down the dirt road a ways until we reach the trail through the woods . I 'm carrying a towel and wearing a bathing suit underneath my cut-offs even though it 's all of seventy-four degrees out . The trees suddenly open out onto the quarry . it always takes me by surprise . You 're in thick pine trees one minute and the next , you 're looking out on a pool of deep glassy water , edged by granite cliff . " Paraiso , " Miguel says softly . I 've had enough Spanish to know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenic as things get around here , personally , I would never use that word to describe anything in this town . Besides , last year Bobby Sexton , a senior from our school , drowned in the quarry . The thing is , you 're supposed to dive into the water from the highest point on the rock . It 's one of those stupid dares that we all go along with , even though everyone knows that if you dive from that point and you do n't hit the water just right , you hit granite . That 's what happened to Bobby . Me and Nonie and Miguel find a smooth spot on the rock that 's got an oak tree arching over it . Miguel pulls a nubby , plaid blanket from his pack . Nonie stretches out on it , gazing into the branches . She 's wearing cut-offs and a white camisole that rides up on her rib cage . I sit beside her , have a cigarette , and watch as Miguel cracks open a beer and carefully lets one drop fall on Nonie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even when he licks it from her skin . I 'm wondering if this is something I should be watching . But I can see she 's completely at ease with him . Like she 's known him forever . Nonie closes her eyes and I open a can of soda . Miguel drinks his beer , one hand resting on her upper arm , his thumb stroking her skin . For a long time no one says anything . I listen to a fly buzzing , study the shadows in the trees , and I think I see something moving in the pines . Miguel sees it , too . His dark eyes follow the flicker of movement . " It 's hunting , " he tells me softly . " What is ? " He answers with a word in Spanish that sounds like charcoal , then says , " Do n't worry . It wo n't come near us . Not now . " He lies down beside Nonie , soaking in the cool sun , one hand cupping her hipbone . He is so still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonie , making sure that her chest continues to rise and fall , hoping that this is just a nap and not a sign of some fatal disease . And then suddenly I start thinking about Bobby Sexton and I get really scared . " Nonie , " I say loudly . " You ca n't go in the water . " " Why not ? " she asks . She sits up and rubs tanning oil onto her arms . Her hair is hanging loose , hiding the side of her face . " Because that 's how it 's going to happen , " I say . " We 're all going to dive in there . Only you wo n't surface . Do n't you see ? " Nonie works her hair into a French braid . I do n't think so , " she says calmly . " It 's too cold for me to swim . That 's not how it 's going to happen . " " I thought you did n't know how , " I say . " I do n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the shape of it. , " " Cam . " Miguel 's voice is drowsy . " You play this shape game , too ? " I do n't answer him . Because Nonie and I have this unspoken pact to never tell anyone else about the game . Except , I realize , obviously she 's told Miguel . It makes me feel funny inside . Like something got betrayed . " Cam , " she says . " I did n't tell him . Miguel just knows things . " " The way you just know things ? " She nods . It makes me feel left out , excluded from the Gifted Psychics Club . " Well , I guess that 's why you two get on , " I say . Miguel opens one sleepy eye . " Loca girl , " he whispers . I sort of lose it at that point . " Did you tell him ? " I demand . " And does he know that you think you 're about to die ? " I Miguel gets to his feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " he says . He walks into the trees , vanishes in their shadows , and reemerges at the high point of the cliff . Quickly , carelessly , he arcs out over the water and enters it in a smooth , perfect dive . I hold my breath for a long moment , praying he 'll surface . He does , his black hair clinging to his skin like a pelt . Nonie , her eyes closed again , does n't watch any of this . " We made love last night , " she tells me as he begins swimming the length of the quarry . " In St. David Cemetery . " " That is so completely macabre - " " No , it was beautiful - the gravestones were all glowing in the moonlight . And it was comforting . When I first really understood that I was going to die soon , I was so scared . And gradually that 's gone away . In the cemetery with Miguel , the last of the fear left me . I felt ... at home there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk this way , " I tell her . " I hate it ! I see you and you start telling me how you wo n't be here much longer and - " I ca n't finish because my nose is running and I 'm blinking back tears . Nonie takes my hands in hers . " Listen to me , Cam , " she says . " I 'm not trying to scare you . I 've only been telling you because I want you to know that it 's not frightening for me . I want you to be okay about it , too . " " Well , I 'm not . " My throat is burning and the words come out ragged . She puts her arms around me and holds me close . " You have to be , " she says . " You have to be . " About a week later at three A.M. on Sunday morning , Patrick wakes me up . " The police are downstairs , " he says . " They need to ask you about Nonie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is it , I think . She 's gone . And she is . The police are responding to a call from her mother . Nonie went out with Miguel on Friday night . She never came back . In fact , no one can find Miguel either . The police ask me if I think they might have run away together . Or could it be another one of those crazy suicide pacts ? I tell them I do n't know . They ask me where I 'd look for her . And I see all the places where we used to go together - the park when we were little and mad for the swings , the vintage clothing boutique where we both bought antique silk slips , the hill behind the school . And I know they wo n't find her in any of those places . Forty-eight hours later Nonie and Miguel are both officially declared missing . It comes out later that week that everything Miguel gave them was a lie . The address he gave the school was false , along with his phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the state did n't have a record of his truck . His locker at school was empty . It was like Miguel Alvarez was someone we all imagined . But Nonie ... Nonie was real and was really gone . Two weeks later they dragged the quarry . Nothing in the water except an old , rusted Corvette that a drunk college boy drove in there years ago . So Nonie 's mother declared that her " no-good daughter and that Spanish boy " had run away . That one day Nonie would be back , probably pregnant , and then she 'd better pray for Jesus and Mary 's mercy because her parents were n't going to have anything to do with her . I was the only one who was certain Nonie was no longer alive . Until they found her body in the woods that led to the quarry . Her neck was tom open . The rest of her body was untouched . I miss her so much . I 've been screwing up in school , fighting with my folks . I keep wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is months before I 'm finally able to open the box with Nonie 's journals in it . I start with the most recent one . It begins like this : Today I saw Miguel for the first time . We recognized each other at once . He scared me at first - until I saw the warmth in his eyes . He took my hand , led me outside , said , " You know who I am , do n't you ? " I just nodded . My voice was gone . I 'd been expecting something . I just never dreamed it would be in the shape of someone as beautiful as Miguel . " Do n't worry , I will make it easy for you , querida , 11 he told me . " There is nothing to fear . " We walked up to the hill behind the school and sat down in the place where Cam and I always sit . Then he said , " In my mother 's village , in Guatemala , they know that certain people are born with powers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that when we are born into this world , there is also an animal , a nagual , born into the underworld , and we share the same spirit with that animal . Some people , the ones with powers one minute they are human , the next they become their animal spirit . You understand ? " I knew what he was telling me . I said , " You have an animal inside you . " I could n't see the shape of it yet . But I sensed it there , its heart beat matching his , its strength and wariness coursing through his body . He ran a hand down the side of my face and let me look into his eyes for what seemed a long time . I still could n't quite see it . So he went on . He said that sometimes the nagual is more than nagual . It is characotel , the one who shifts shape to carry the spirits of the dying to the Dueno de Muerte , the God of Death . It is the suerte , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she must journey to the Dueno and tell him how many people are going to die . Then he told me this story There was a woman characotel , and she married a man who did n't know her true nature . But he soon noticed that she was sick all the time . This was because she was n't bringing enough spirits to the Dueno of Death . The characoteles feed on the bones of the dead , and she was n't getting enough of these bones . She was wasting away . The husband tried to get her to eat , to give her medicines , but she would n't take a thing . This made her husband very sad . Finally , a neighbor asked what was wrong ; was he fighting with his wife ? No , the man answered . His wife was getting weak and thin and she refused to eat with him . That is because she is a characotel , the neighbor said . She goes every Wednesday and Friday night to eat bones at the cemetery . You must follow her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did as the neighbor advised . He followed the woman at night to the cemetery . And he heard her speaking to the Dueno of Death . The next morning the husband told his wife they were going to eat breakfast together . She refused , and he accused her of being a characotel . So the characotel turned her husband into a dog . That Friday night the dog followed her to the cemetery . And the wife explained to the Dueno of Death that she punished her husband so that he would not tell anyone about her . The Dueno said that he would change the dog back into a man , but he warned the man that he would die if he told anyone what he had seen . The man agreed , but he returned home deranged , unable to work or even dress himself . The woman characotel soon sickened and died . The Dueno took her life because she was not a good worker for him . It was only after the husband told the people of his pueblo the whole story that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that story ? " Miguel asked . I thought , I know why every three weeks you disappear from school .. every twenty days the characoteles report to the Dueno of Death . But what I said was something dumb , like , " You 're warning me that you 'll turn me into a dog if I tell on you ? " And he said , " No . I want you to know that with my kind - it is possible to stop us . " " And then you 'll die instead of me , " I said . He shrugged . " I will take my chances with the Dueno . " So I took his hands in mine and I looked into his eyes again . They were so dark . From another place , another time . Below us on the road , I could hear the sounds of the traffic . But in his eyes I saw forests . I could smell the damp earth after a rain . I could hear birds calling , feel lizards scuttling along the leaves . AndI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human but as a nagual with the soft , rippling tread of a jaguar . " No , " I told him . " I 'm not like that man in the story . I 'm not frightened of you . " " Bueno , " I he said . " Then we will have some time together before I take you . " So I am going to have time with Miguel .... I read more of the journal . And I see how she snuck out of her house nearly every night to be with him . It amazes me that I never knew . I mean , I knew they were lovers . I never guessed at what he truly was . But Nonie saw the shape inside him . And he saw all that was inside her . Nonie 's very last journal entry is a short one : Miguel says it wo n't be long now . And that 's all right . I 'm ready . Eager , even . I worry about Cam , though . I do n't know how to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband in Miguel 's story if she is able to know the whole truth and then tell it , she will be all right . So , Cam , if you are reading this , remember : what 's inside us can take so many forms , and there is beauty even in the ones that seem most frightening . Know that when I 'm gone I 'll still be there for you . In certain songs . in the shadows . Whenever you see the shape of things . - for Tania Yatskievych who gave me the seed of the story , and Erica Swadley who set it in motion .
