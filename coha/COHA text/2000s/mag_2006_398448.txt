Section : Special Report The insular world of intelligence reaches out for a few new ideas <p> At a modest office building just outside Boston last July , senior U.S. intelligence officials quietly set in motion an unusual experiment . For four weeks , a handpicked group of 20 outside experts brainstormed , argued , and chewed the fat with 20 top analysts from the CIA and eight other intelligence agencies . Their mission : to understand why people join terrorist organizations and other groups engaged in antisocial activity . The issues went to some of the most basic questions confronting Washington 's intelligence mandarins : What 's driving the spread of extremism around the globe , and how can it be stopped ? <p> Dubbed the Summer Hard Problems workshop , or SHARP , the program is modeled after a highly successful project by the code-breaking National Security Agency , which for years has brought in top mathematicians to tackle cutting-edge issues in encryption . SHARP similarly threw together leading specialists , but from the social sciences : experts in anthropology , social psychology , insurgency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the esoteric talk about jihadism , group dynamics , and social networks , the SHARP participants had a second mission : to change the way U.S. intelligence agencies do their job , by opening the notoriously insular espionage community to the rest of the world . <p> SHARP is the brainchild of the 18-month-old Office of the Director of National Intelligence , which is charged with overseeing and reforming the nation 's sprawling $44 billion intelligence community . Key to that effort is an organized attack on the kind of " groupthink " that resulted in U.S. intelligence agencies getting dead wrong , among other things , nearly every facet of Saddam Hussein 's banned weapons programs . Reformers at the DNI and other agencies hope to answer critics who call the nation 's spy agencies obsolete-a bunch of big bureaucracies so addicted to secrecy that they ca n't cope in the Internet age . " This culture of secrecy in an information-rich world is totally anachronistic , " says Phil Williams , an international security expert at the University of Pittsburgh who often consults with intelligence agencies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espionage agencies do business , senior DNI officials are pushing an effort unlike any seen since the height of the Vietnam War , nearly 40 years ago . The SHARP workshop is but one of a wide array of outreach projects now underway , involving millions of dollars in contracts , fellowships , conferences-even wikis and blogs-directed at scholars and other outside experts . DNI officials are mindful of the past , when Vietnam War-era funding drew loud protests on campus , amid charges that the CIA had skewed academic research on Asian studies and secretly backed groups like the National Student Association . The new effort has also begun to stir controversy , but for those who respond , the rewards can be considerable , including contracts , lucrative stipends , and a chance to influence analysis at the CIA and 15 other intelligence agencies . The scope is broad : A classified DNI survey this year yielded 240 pages of outreach efforts involving virtually every U.S. agency that generates intelligence information . Those interested ( and invited ) enter a world of exclusive conferences , workshops , studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but experts at think tanks , international groups , foundations , and businesses , as well as medical doctors and scientists . " The intelligence community will never be big enough , will never have enough analysts , " says Thomas Fingar , the DNI 's chief of analysis . " There 's an absolute need to go outside . " <p> Fingar 's office is spearheading the charge . The DNI 's new plan , " A Strategy for Analytic Outreach , " reviewed by U.S. News , calls for a major effort at building " communities of interest " with outside experts and revamping security regulations to allow far greater contact with the outside world . Fingar hopes to replicate what he accomplished as head of the State Department 's small but respected intelligence arm , the Bureau of Intelligence and Research . INR is widely credited with having gotten issues right that other agencies missed and having provided some of the government 's only skeptical reporting on Saddam 's banned weapons . A key reason for INR 's success , Fingar says , is its marked openness compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau held 280 conferences and seminars with outside experts-nearly one a day . " Part of INR 's success was their Rolodexes , " says Fingar . " The intelligence community ca n't stay closed and do its job . " <p> Going Hollywood . CIA officials are taking the cue and expanding their outreach efforts . " It 's part of the job , " says one official . " You 're expected to reach out . " CIA analysts last year met with academics and outside experts at some 100 conferences or meetings each month , according to the agency 's chief of intelligence , John Kringen . Among the more active groups : the CIA 's secretive Red Cell unit , formed after 9/11 to think up " out of the box " scenarios , and the little-known Global Futures Partnership , which runs a handful of invitation-only conferences around the world to look at long-term trends and strategic issues . With Rand , the GFP ran a series of one-day workshops on how to encourage critical analysis , bringing in over 30 outside experts from fields as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology . Also active is the CIA 's Office of Transnational Issues , whose conferences have focused on infectious diseases , " unconventional " security threats , and U.S. global competitiveness in information technology . The CIA has also sponsored a Cyber-Influence Conference Series , which has met , among other places , in Hollywood to discuss the " strategic use " of the Internet , computer games , movies , and entertainment against U.S. adversaries . <p> Despite all the efforts at outreach , the push to gain outside expertise remains controversial . Distrust of outsiders is rife among many intelligence professionals , who are fearful of violating secrecy pledges and tend to discount information not marked classified or secret . Some also worry about openly expressing their views at a time when intelligence work has become something of a political football . Take , for example , a recent conference on Vietnam sponsored by the CIA 's Center for the Study of Intelligence and Texas Tech University . Analysts at the center slated to attend were warned not to make comparisons to Iraq , sources tell U.S. News . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with intelligence agencies , worried that such ties will discredit them , imperil their work , or skew scholarship . Among the hot buttons : CIA sponsorship of social scientists ' work abroad . Critics say this kind of contracting , now being pushed by some in the intelligence world , risks endangering scholars ' sources and informants , while tainting fieldwork by American researchers around the world . <p> The concern over intelligence work is particularly acute among the nation 's 15,000 anthropologists , whose overseas fieldwork and language skills are of special value to U.S. intelligence . The American Anthropological Association has pulled a CIA recruiting ad from its website and recently launched a commission to investigate the field 's ties to U.S. intelligence . " I have one issue with all this : secrecy , " says David Price of St. Martin 's College , a critic of the growing ties and author of the forthcoming Anthropology at War , a study of the field 's work during World War II . " My worry is what happens to our entire discipline when the notion of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Bad old days . Another point of contention is scholarships funded by the intelligence community . At least three scholarship programs are doling out millions of dollars to prospective analysts and spies-up to $25,000 annually per student-for study of key languages and regions such as China , central Asia , and the Middle East . One particularly controversial scholarship is the Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program , which funds about 100 students . It has been denounced by some scholars because its recipients perform internships at intelligence agencies and remain unidentified to professors and classmates-a reminder for some of the bad old days of the 1960s , when the FBI and CIA kept tabs on the political views of U.S. professors . Critics like Price also argue that rather than opening intelligence-agency minds , the scholarships may have the opposite effect , pigeonholing young scholars prematurely and fostering the very kind of groupthink that reformers hope to avoid . <p> Along with money for intelligence training and study , other funds are pouring into campuses for homeland security and terrorism studies . The National Academic Consortium for Homeland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member colleges and universities . The Department of Homeland Security is putting $82 million into a half-dozen universities , funding so-called Centers of Excellence that look at security issues and counterterrorism strategy . The DNI is considering whether to expand the idea across the intelligence community , with other agencies funding similar centers . <p> The ties between academia and the intelligence community have long blown hot and cold . As many as half of America 's anthropologists joined the war effort during the 1940s , working for military intelligence and the CIA 's predecessor , the Office of Special Services . Both the OSS and the early CIA drew heavily from Ivy League faculty among various departments . But during the Vietnam War , anthropologists were implicated in work on classified projects linked to counterinsurgency operations in Thailand . The resulting firestorm prompted ethics rules within the profession , prohibiting secret research or reports . <p> " Streetcraft . " The DNI 's Fingar is sympathetic to such concerns . The new outreach effort , he says , " has to be 100 percent transparent . There 'll be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work do n't typically go hand in hand . The problems were readily apparent at the SHARP workshop , where suggestions of intelligence agency funding of fieldwork raised alarm among some scholars . The DNI allowed U.S. News to observe several days of the workshop , with the understanding that no participants be identified by name . " Most scholars are unwilling to admit to any dealings whatsoever with the intel community , " confided one anthropologist in attendance . " The reason is that the connection , at least in anthro , is so reviled that it can negatively impact one 's career . " <p> The SHARP workshop offered a glimpse into other challenges posed by the new outreach . Outside experts were given basic clearances-at the secret level-for three of the gathering 's four weeks . During the one unclassified week , intelligence analysts avoided making presentations and generally steered clear of anyone from overseas . One National Security Agency analyst , asked by U.S. News where she worked , froze in place and tensely replied , " The U.S. government . " Others declined even to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff of open , honest discourse , " said one discouraged professor . But other scholars were more enthusiastic , particularly once this reporter and the foreign guests departed . The monthlong effort ended up producing 47 unclassified papers and 10 classified ones , with most attendees saying they would eagerly participate again . New SHARP workshops are being planned that may focus on " medical intelligence " - how to best detect disease outbreaks and bioterrorism attacks , for example-and on crossover " streetcraft " techniques useful for police detectives , FBI agents , and intelligence operatives . <p> While questions persist within academia , intelligence officials have found a warmer reception within the business community . Many of the programs are classified , involving sensitive operations like companies offering nonofficial cover to CIA officers abroad and NSA eavesdroppers gaining access to company communications . But a glimpse at the extent of cooperation can be seen at In-Q-Tel , the unique venture-capital firm set up by the CIA in 1999 to invest in cutting-edge technologies . Since 9/11 , business at In-Q-Tel has boomed . Its budget has soared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence agencies . " We 've had such a surge of people trying to do whatever they could , " says Scott Yancey , In-Q-Tel 's senior executive officer . " There 's been a huge push to find new technologies . " <p> In the year before 9/11 , In-Q-Tel received some 600 submissions from private companies for funding . In the year after the attacks , it received 1,600 , and that number has kept pace today . In-Q-Tel has reviewed nearly 6,000 business plans and invested in over 90 firms , most of them since 9/11 . Most had never worked with the U.S. government before . In the process , the company has brought together hundreds of high-tech entrepreneurs , venture capitalists , university researchers , and U.S. intelligence officials . Yancey sees little of the caution that exists in academia . " The business community , " he says , " is pumped up when they see the opportunity to serve the country . " <p> Even for skeptical scholars , the temptation to lend their expertise to an intelligence community asking for help may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has done seminars under every administration since the Carter presidency and feels his efforts are now more important than ever . Given Washington 's recent record of glaring intelligence failures , he adds , " I am very disposed to doing anything I can to bring some enlightenment to these people .
