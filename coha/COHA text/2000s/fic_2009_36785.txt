Kindling <p> Pageantry <p> Let me tell you something about elementary school : it 's full of sly madness . I know most people picture little kids running around and wreaking havoc , splashing primary-colored paints all over the walls , liberating slimy class pets like frogs and lizards and more or less making the river Styx look like Lake Placid . But it 's actually a madhouse in a very different way . It 's not just a madhouse but an asylum . In asylums , the harshest , most deranged madnesses are those that are less verbal and more emotional , those that happen internally instead of screamed at the top of lungs or unleashed by overturning desks . Pushing and shoving are nothing compared to sly note passing and stares through slitted eyes . And I 'm in the midst of both right now . <p> A week ago , two Big Events happened . One of the Events was the announcement of the 1992 Martin Van Buren Elementary School Fall Talent Show . <p> " So , class , " said Mrs. Nevins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perm-topped , eraser-pink face at the tip . " It 's not too early to start thinking about the fall talent show . " <p> Cue the Hallelujah Chorus . <p> " I know many of you participated last year , and I encourage all of you to participate again this year . You have a couple of months to decide on your acts and rehearse them . Then you will have to fill out this form " - she was handing slips of light blue paper to each of us- " and describe what your act will be . It can be anything you want-you can dance or sing or play the piano or do a funny skit . Or you could even lip-synch to a song . " <p> She must have been joking because almost everyone lip-synchs to a song . It takes no talent to do this . I 'll never forget the disgusting sight that was Kevin Bartlett dressed in a leather jacket and a Beethoven-like wig while he " strummed " a cardboard guitar and " sang " Bon Jovi 's " Livin ' on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't even really know any of the words besides the chorus , so , minus the music , he was just standing and staring . Everyone was basically listening to the radio for five minutes . But their cheers after he " finished " meant that they loved it . Then there was the " brilliance " that was Cindy Michaels hand-jiving to Madonna 's " Papa Do n't Preach . " Obviously , Cindy 's mother , Ms. Lansing , did n't ever stop to listen to the " I got knocked up but I 'm going to keep the baby " lyrics , nor the fact that chances were Cindy , who smooched every boy in class , might someday live up to the words . There are countless examples of other lip-synching fiascos that I could mention , but suffice it to say that 99.9 percent of the school is virtually talentless , and there is only that one rare diamond in the rough that shines through the mold . <p> And I 'm a 400-carat stone , baby . <p> Unfortunately , the announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Event : Kiran Being Wronged by Two Cold-Hearted Snakes . <p> Sarah Turner and Melissa Jenkins-elementary school wenches of the worst degree . In the Polaroid of my mind , the three of us sit arranged on the playground swings : Sarah on the left swing , her golden-retriever hair crossed by a purple headband and buoyed at the temples by two elfin ears . Me on the center swing , large brown eyes and mop-top black hair , red sweatsuit sheathing my body , legs crossed as if I 'm a hostess . Melissa on the right , a near-clone of Punky Brewster-her hair in brown , almost black , tresses styled on her head ( and which used to be in pigtails and fastened with a smiling yellow-sun barrette before she hit sixth grade and thought it too juvenile ) ; freckles sprinkled over her nose ; ragtag outfit made of a purple jean jacket and a rainbow of odd accessories-red and green tie-dyed T-shirt , blue Capri pants , orange socks . Amidst the scenery of gray gravel beneath our feet , the swings beneath our bottoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slides and merry-go-round behind us , we are a brilliant splash of color , and I seem to be the nexus , my dark face and hair forming the stem of my cherry tomato clothing . <p> But the reality is different . <p> A week ago , the first day of sixth grade , Sarah and Melissa come up to me just before recess . <p> " Key-ran , " Sarah says , shaking her mane to get it out of her face . " Wan na go swinging today ? " <p> I ca n't believe my luck ; last school year , I used to wander out to the swings all by my lonesome , bucking the Mariah Carey craze and humming Whitney Houston 's classic " How Will I Know ? " in my puberty-endangered soprano . <p> " Me ? " I say , raising a hand to my chest and widening my eyes as if the girls have just pronounced me Miss America . <p> " Of course , silly , " Melissa says . She tugs at the lapels of her jean jacket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown ' do . <p> The two of them lead me out to the swings . As we pass by , our classmates ' mouths round into shocked O 's . We walk through the gravel , kicking up stones and lifting dust into the air . It is the end of August , still summer , and you can tell that all of the kids feel oddly out of place , stunned to know that the weather can persist even if the vacation can not . All of us have spent a morning with our summery thirst for diversion pent up , and even though we are in sixth grade now-the highest grade in this school-we cling to recess as much as we ever have , so when Sarah , Melissa , and I reach the swings , we slide into the floppy black seats with a goal to swing until our legs are blue at the knee . <p> " Let 's see who can swing highest , " Melissa says , pushing off and demonstrating exemplary technique-a smooth extension of her two gams , pressed together , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls back , bending her knees so that each leg forms a V parallel to the ground . Her lips are pursed in heavy concentration at first , but as she falls into her rhythm , her face becomes supremely serene . I begin to copy , a bouquet of butterflies rising in me-a feeling I mistake at first for fear but later identify , all too sadly , as pride . <p> I give it everything I have . A breeze forms around me as I swing , the summer day now feeling brisk and cool . I can feel the air blowing through the fabric of my sweatpants , can hear the squeak of the swings ' hinges and the breaths of exertion as Sarah and Melissa move higher , can smell faint wisps of their Petit NatT perfume . I push harder , almost coming out of my seat , and I notice that as I swing forward , the girls swing back . This gives me an overwhelming sense of victory , a bragging right of sorts . But I do n't dare brag . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Whitney . <p> I swing higher , so out of breath it is like I am in the stratosphere . And then a sound stops my reverie . I look down to see the swings on either side of me dangling , their chains clinking . Just below and in front of me are Sarah and Melissa , their arms folded , mother-like . As I slide past the ground , I jam my feet into the gravel and look up at my new friends . <p> " We 're finished swinging , " says Sarah . One shake of her doggy hair . " Let 's go on the monkey bars . " <p> I gulp . Monkey barring has never been my best sport . And yes , since I am a bumbling fool when it comes to tennis ( which Indians play ) and football or basketball ( which Americans play ) , monkey barring is the closest thing to a sport for me . <p> Sarah and Melissa walk arm in arm to the bars and hoist themselves up . They look down at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , Key-ran , " Melissa says . " Are ya scared ? " <p> I am scared , but I grab a bar in each hand and pull . <p> My body does n't go any higher . In fact , it goes lower , as my legs swing under me and my sweatpant-covered knees dig into the gravel . I swing forward toughly , yank back , and fall onto my ass , each little jagged pebble like a mini-dagger against my cheeks . <p> I am lucky Sarah and Melissa do n't abandon me on the spot . Others would have : A cluster of buzz-cut third grade boys wearing Transformers T-shirts and playing with the half-car , half-robot toys looks up and grunts . Four girls with big bangs and slap bracelets on their wrists stop their game of four-square , their inflated red rubber ball bouncing away in flimsy flops , then rolling to a stop on the blacktop . At least three games of tag , two between girls , one between a boy and a girl , halt . This is nothing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're the cherry tomato foreign boy ass-down in the gravel , the toy-playing boys transform into the robot men in their hands , smashing and snarling metallically . The stares from the four-square players are so piercing that the girls might as well have chucked the rubber ball at your head , a soft but meaningful thud resounding . And the halted cat-and-mouse games of tag represent this truth : all quarrels , all grievances have stopped , because the attention has turned to you and your worthlessness . <p> But somehow , through some great stroke of luck , Sarah and Melissa do n't look at you that way . They look at each other , trying not to show their laughter so as to avoid hurting your feelings , strengthening you with their compassion . Instead , they dismount , take a hand of yours , and hoist you up . They link their arms in yours and skip you off to The Clearing . <p> The Clearing is quite a sizeable chunk of land for a school playground . It 's several acres big , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeshift soccer field in the middle . Along the perimeter of The Clearing runs a series of fitness exercises that the school installed a few years ago as proof that the administrators were capable of making the students healthier . However , once this promise earned more tax money , the fitness course did not receive a proper upkeep , so the wooden structures are pathetic now . There is a warped balance beam that looks like one of those soggy brown runt French fries in a McDonald 's Happy Meal . There is a pair of pull-up bars , one short , one tall , that long ago fell over into the uncut grass around them . And there is a set of increasingly tall logs that one is supposed to ascend , the final rough-hewn cylinder the tallest but , of course , the last , so that the only options are to descend the way one came or to jump to one 's fate-which many kids have done and , in so doing , have broken their stupid limbs . <p> It is to the French fry balancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that direction , they are more talkative than ever . <p> " So , Key-ran , " Melissa says . " Who 's better-Malibu Barbie or Evening Gown Barbie ? " <p> " Evening Gown Barbie , " I say . It just comes right out of me , but once I say it , I ca n't stop . " She is posh and elegant . But my preferred doll is actually Strawberry Shortcake . " <p> Sarah giggles , but Melissa is silent , confused . <p> " You talk funny , " Melissa says . <p> " It 's because he studies extra language arts with Mrs. Goldberg after school , " Sarah says . " He 's a smarty-pants . You did n't know that , Melissa ? " <p> " Oh , I just forgot . You do n't usually talk that much , Key-ran . Otherwise I would know how smart you are . " She smiles sweetly and winks at Sarah . <p> I " blush . " That 's in quotes because the only blush I can get is from the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else do you like about Evening Gown Barbie ? " Sarah asks as we near the balance beam . <p> As unabashedly as before , I tick off my list of Evening Gown Barbie pros : <p> " Her dress shimmers ; her eyeshadow has silver glitter in it , so it gleams extra-specially ; her hair is straight , so you can style her golden locks in many different ways ; and she comes with a hot pink comb , which you can use to do your own hair when you dress up in the mirror . " <p> This last tidbit is the only thing that seems to impress Sarah and Melissa , who have let go of my arms and flank me-presenting me as a bride to the balance beam . <p> " Well , do n't you like Ken ? " Sarah asks , putting one hand on my shoulder , and now something feels a little stranger than usual , especially when I see a small bump form in my sweatpants , like a creature rousing itself to wake . <p> " Uh , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Ken , too , " Melissa says . There is a devilish glow in her eyes that would never have crossed Punky 's . <p> " But , " Sarah says , her face now so close to mine that I can smell her breath-a mixture of candy and warm , almost stinky saliva- " you know Ken is missing something . " <p> Gulp . " Yeah ... " <p> " You 're gon na show it to us , Key-ran , " Melissa says , and I know for certain that Punky never acted like this because Henry Warnemont , her foster parent , would have disowned and reorphaned her for this kind of slutty behavior . " John Griffin showed us his and we did n't even have to ask . But he bet us five dollars yours is different . He said yours looks like an elephant . " <p> " It does not ! " I say , knowing what they mean . I had my traumatic " naked father " moment years ago , at which point I realized there was a certain flesh-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only thing I got as a first-generation Indian was fore thought . <p> I do n't think Sarah and Melissa will accept the truth right now , though . Like tourists on a safari , when they want to see an elephant , they want to see an elephant . <p> As the girls press in , the bulge in my pants gets bigger , and it seems , in that moment , that what makes me plop myself down on the balance beam is that hipward rush of blood instead of trying to dodge Sarah and Melissa 's sexual advances . Down I go on the beam , the girls clanking heads as if in a really bad Laurel and Hardy spoof . But soon a more dire collision has occurred . <p> In the few years since Mr. Hughes , the amply-stomached groundskeeper , stopped looking after the fitness course , it seems the balance beam has formed a porcupine-like covering of thick , sharp splinters . One such splinter punctures through my sweatpants and an inch into my right cheek . <p> I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Please imagine the saccharine smiles on their faces . Imagine the countless sleepovers they must have , the boys they discuss with open-jawed squeals , the dress-ups and the dolls and the compacts of makeup , the slam books and kisses against their arms . Imagine the conspiratorial wickedness , the cunning plotting , the yearbook searches , seeking out that perfect victim . Imagine them settling on the foreign kid , the one who wears bright , primary-colored sweatsuits , the one who sings to himself , moves his hips and dances when he thinks no one is looking , who draws intricate pictures of pretty girls , sometimes , even , of these conniving girls . Imagine the " Look at Me , I 'm Sandra Dee " scene from Grease , that bevy of tough chicks , smoking and boozing and stuffing their bras with quilted Kleenex , then think of what those girls were like in elementary school , what Rizzo did with her biting sarcasm and animalistic instincts before sexing them away in the back of secondhand convertibles . <p> Got that picture ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartless hussies would do if they saw the foreign kid get a splinter up his ass . <p> Hear that banshee wail of laughter ? Now imagine being the squashed cherry tomato on the beam , realizing you need to modify your moniker for your " best friends " : they are not really best friends , but , rather , the best friends you can get . The best friends you can get are two girls who laugh at the grimace of pain you make ; laugh at the way you wobble your way off the beam- the splinter coming with you ; laugh as you hop , wincing , across The Clearing , which seems all the more enormous now ; laugh at how you have to go up to Mrs. Moehlman , the teacher on duty , and tell her you have to go to the nurse 's office for ... <p> " For what , honey ? " <p> " For ... I got a ... I got a tummyache . " <p> " A tummy ache ? Honey , then why are you grabbing your behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moehlman is wearing sunglasses from which two mini-Kirans look back at you , grimacing and looking mortally constipated . <p> Over the next few days , the beautiful girls I once deemed my saviors lead the anti-Kiran rally . They 're like political muckrakers to the Kiran Sharma campaign , whispering to people about the extraordinary flamboyances of my schoolgoing career . They bring up the time I went to Principal Taylor and asked her if I could go home to see if the cabbage I had planted in the backyard had grown into a Cabbage Patch Kid yet . They unearth the fact that for three days in third grade , I showed up to class wearing a heavy fog of my mom 's Elizabeth Arden Red Door perfume until Mrs. Walters had to pull me aside and tell me it was causing my next-desk neighbor Chris Johnson to break out in hives . Then they uncover the time I had a copy of Judy Blume 's Are You There God ? It 's Me , Margaret , that hearty tribute to burgeoning female pubescence , in my desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Mrs. Fisher told me it was too advanced a reading level for second grade , though I suspected this was not the real reason , a ) because I was already attempting Sherlock Holmes stories by then , and b ) because she asked to borrow the book and never gave it back . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
