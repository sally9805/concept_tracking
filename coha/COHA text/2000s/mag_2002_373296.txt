But it might not have finished the job . A third Buddha  --  the so-called sleeping Buddha  --  may yet exist in Bamiyan , buried just feet from where the other Buddhas once stood . A 7th century Chinese traveler left notes describing the sculpture as measuring up to 650 ft. in length and reclining in a state of Nirvana . ( The taller of the two upright Buddhas was just 180 ft . ) The statue is believed to be entombed , either buried intentionally before the first Islamic invaders arrived in the 9th century or covered by debris from an earthquake or the natural erosion of nearby cliffs .
