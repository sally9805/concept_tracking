After three months of searching , the top U.S. weapons inspector in Iraq has come back with news that all sides are using as an occasion for " I told you so . " In an interim report to Congress , David Kay said his 1,200-member inspection team had " not yet found stocks " of illicit weapons  --  no large caches of poison gas or germ agents , no proof that Saddam was remotely close to reconstituting a nuclear program and no evidence of an attempt to buy uranium from Africa . In fact , the report said an African country had offered uranium to Iraq , but Saddam apparently did not follow up . Kay even backed away from Bush 's claim that two trucks found in April and may were mobile bioweapons labs , saying they could have been used for other purposes . Even some Bush allies on Capitol Hill were disturbed . " I 'm not pleased by what I heard today , " said Pat Roberts , G.O.P. chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee . <P> Yet Kay 's team did make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient proof that Saddam was " a danger to the world " and that the war was justified . Kay 's team discovered a vial hidden in a scientist 's home containing a biological agent , as well as evidence that in 2001 Saddam paid $10 million in an effort to buy prohibited missile technology from North Korea . ( The equipment was never delivered . ) Kay also said an Iraqi scientist had been shot and another Iraqi killed after cooperating with inspectors , although that claim was news to a former official in Iraq 's Military Industrialization Commission who was interviewed by TIME late last week . Kay said his work was still in its early stages , and the Administration is reportedly asking Congress for $600 million to fund the search for weapons for six to nine months more . Yet the former official said Kay and his team would be wasting time and money if they kept their search going . " We 've told them everything , " he said . " There is nothing left to say .
