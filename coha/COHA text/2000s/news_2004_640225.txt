<p> God does not hate <p> Re : ' Views of God sway view of gay marriage , ' Feb. 23 Cindy Rodrguez column . <p> Finally , someone articulates the way that much of the gay community feels toward recent events surrounding gay marriage . Thank you , Cindy Rodrguez . <p> My faith is rooted in Judeo-Christian beliefs and yet , as a gay man , I have had to come to terms with much of what I was brought up to believe and that which I have learned in the real world . It makes me sick to see those who would parade around in the name of God and convey hate and disgust to the very people whom God loves as much as they . Shame on them , for they bring disgrace to those who try hard to adhere to Biblical truth - Jew or Christian . The amazing thing is that the God who loves me also loves those who proudly and openly pronounce their twisted view of Biblical truth coupled with hate . My God does not hate . <p> MARK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Cindy Rodrguez and Jim Spencer ( ' Springs ' way with gays is out of Focus ' ) show the customary intolerance for Christian people and organizations like Focus on the Family , accusing them of hate speech . ( Somehow , diatribes against Christians are never hate speech , just righteous indignation . ) <p> Teddy Roosevelt was only partly correct when he said the presidency is a ' bully pulpit . ' Journalists have the bully pulpit - they are the ones who bully . Since they seem to be six feet above the ' congregation ' - their readers - and six feet above reproach , I guess theirs is a pulpit also . <p> Those of us who are limited to letters of 200 words or less once every two months - if we 're lucky - ca n't begin to adequately cover the issues addressed . But perhaps a couple of responses to Rodrguez would illustrate . First , the fact that heterosexual marriages are in such disarray does n't justify homosexual marriage . ( Incidentally , improving heterosexual marriages is much of what Focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that ' Man plus baboon does not equal marriage ' does n't necessarily mean gays are being called baboons . It might simply imply that bestiality could be next in the natural progression of ' marriage ' in the U.S. <p> G.H. THOMPSON <p> Thornton <p>  --  Bird refuge needs help finding , funding new home <p> Re : ' Fallen birds ' rescuers seeking new nest ; Avian rehabilitation volunteers are forced to seek a new location to treat fallen birds , ' Feb. 18 news story . <p> So sad is the coming eviction of non-profit , volunteer-manned Wild Bird Information and Rehabilitation of Denver , started in 2000 as a tribute to Catherine Hurlbutt . I have known Catherine for many years and admire her as no other for all the good she has done on behalf of wild birds . <p> Financed by her retirement money , she revamped her home to care for as many needy birds as could be accommodated in every suitable nook and cranny . She was the one to call when anyone found a feathered creature in distress . <p> Infrequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her pick-up service . <p> Not content to merely minister to their needs , Catherine studied and wrote books about her wards , published and distributed at her own expense . <p> How ironic that such a valuable organization as Wild B.I.R.D. , created to carry on her work , should find itself in such a predicament . I am sending a check to them at P.O. Box 37 , Arvada 80001-0037 , and hope that everyone who has ever enjoyed and known the huge value of these wonderful creatures will do the same . <p> ANITA G. BROWN <p> Colorado Springs <p>  --  Will Ralph Nader seal election for Bush again ? <p> Re : ' Nader steps in despite outcry ; Independent joins presidential race , ' Feb. 23 news story . <p> When I heard Ralph Nader announce on Sunday morning his decision to run for the presidency , it instantly conjured up an interesting , yet discomforting , picture in my mind : a trio of smiles and waving hands standing before the American flag and celebrating victory one upcoming November night : George W. Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where else ? ) , and on the left ? Who else but Ralph Nader , the man who most bolstered the president 's re-election campaign . <p> Nader has responsible and reasonable ideas . It 's a shame they are packaged in an egomaniacal and belligerent mind . <p> In 2000 , he claimed that the Republican and Democratic parties were the same ; but thanks to his sway in New Hampshire and Florida , we have seen how untrue was that claim . And it appears he 's stumping the same ground this time around . I hope that more realistic independent voters who have stood aghast at our country 's steady decline in world respect and apparent deceit on nearly every front from a Karl Rove White House will think carefully about wasting their vote on Nader this time . <p> If this were a race for stubbornness , Nader might even beat Bush . <p> GINNY BAYES <p> Denver <p> Preserve ecology <p> Re : ' Man over nature in Yellowstone , ' Feb. 20 Nicholas D. Kristof column . <p> I have to disagree with Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for man 's immediate entertainment , like snowmobiling , than for the preservation of their ecological and environmental values , because it disregards the fact that there are few such places in our country that are reserved to save them from man 's overuse . <p> The National Park System was set up to preserve places of beauty , so they could be used and appreciated for generations to come . Some activities are unlikely to contribute to the longevity of such areas , and snowmobiling is one of them . <p> There exist millions upon millions of acres of public and private lands where snowmobile nuts are welcome to ply their noise and ability , and to show their ' love of nature . ' Perhaps snowmobiles and ATVs should have their own specialized areas where they would do little additional environmental harm and would satisfy their operators ' desire for adventure without scaring animals and tearing up the landscape . <p> I have to concede , though , that Kristof is right on track in criticizing the park 's use of those highly polluting and hard-to-see-out-of snow coaches that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than snowmobiles , though , fortunately , there are n't many of them . If practically nonpolluting buses can ply Denver 's downtown streets , there could certainly be similar , specialized vehicles ( with tracks ) to provide clean transportation in our national parks . <p> R. KIEFER <p> Golden <p> Leave nature alone <p> Nicholas Kristof argues that more and more people should be allowed to appreciate wilderness . But the problem is , we seem to be incapable of enjoying our environment without destroying it . The purpose of nature is not that it should be seen . The purpose of nature is to be left alone . For decades , we have mercilessly and shamelessly exploited our beautiful Earth and its gifts to us because of the selfish and greedy actions of a few . The prevailing attitude is me first , and the devil with the environment and everything else that has to live here . <p> We must leave some places untouched before we ultimately destroy the only home we will ever have . Does ' Soylent Green ' ring a bell ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caretaker , not destroyer . After all , we have no place else to go . <p> CAROLYN P. SOMMERVILLE <p> Denver <p> Machines not that bad <p> Thank you for finally printing a common-sense column about the snowmobile issue . However , I am saddened to see Mike Keefe 's environmental extremist-type cartoon accompanying Nicholas Kristof 's fine article . It is obvious Kristof has snowmobiled into Yellowstone , while Keefe has not . Keefe chooses to ignore the fact that the cleaner and quieter machines are now mandated . To help put the issue in perspective , if we do the math , we find snowmobiles are utilized on only 0.00084 percent of the land surface of Yellowstone and Teton National Parks - and for just 23 percent of the year . Even this is too much for the environmental elite , who were never taught to share by their mothers . <p> ROBERT E.
