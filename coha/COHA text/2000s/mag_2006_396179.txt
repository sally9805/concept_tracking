Section : food &; nutrition What really got my attention and made me drop my bad habits <p> A few years ago , and for a period of 7 years , I was ill with constant diarrhea and a series of viruses , from pneumonia to pleurisy to shingles . I felt like a string of antique pearls , always in danger of falling apart . None of the 20 doctors and other healers I consulted could tell me what was wrong . During the worst of it , my skin broke out in bleeding rashes , and my hair and fingernails fell out . <p> Then I met a doctor who , after a series of blood tests , put me on a diet . Other doctors had prescribed the candida yeast-free diet , the high-protein diet , and the macrobiotic diet ; I had tried them all , but they did n't work . I felt like I always did while dieting : crazed , deprived , and out of control . And after every one of them , I went on a knock-your-socks-off binge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my verve for bingeing after a diet . ) But this diet was different because it made sense ; it was aligned with my soul . By that I mean that if I had been able to push past my shtick about food , I would have already known , already been doing what she told me to do . <p> During the initial visit , my new doctor said : " Think of your body as the earth . If you want to plant a life-giving garden , you need to make sure the soil is rich with nutrients . For most of your life , you 've been stripping the ground and still expecting to grow healthy plants . Now you need to put some minerals back . <p> " Eat less sugar , more protein , more fat . Eat snacks , even at bedtime . Move your body every day . Use nature as a restorative . Rest twice as much as you already do . " Finally , Something Sensible <p> After she spoke , I felt as if the cells in my body stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to this girl , " although what came out of my mouth was , " I ca n't do this . I will get fat . " My doctor said , " I do n't think you will  --  your body is starved for this kind of nourishment . But what would you rather have : a ragged , joyless , hairless thin body or a healthy , radiant bigger body ? " <p> It was , as they say , " a moment . " <p> My husband , Matt , was sitting beside me , waiting to hear my answer . I knew he was astonished that I was actually considering the question , and he was wondering if he 'd married a lunatic . I knew there was no choice , but I also knew that if I started this " diet " I had to be willing to gain weight , possibly 10 or 20 pounds . I had to become a beginner again , throw out the diet-expert image , and start over . <p> Which is exactly what I did . For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wacky . I kept calling the doctor with questions : Why do I need so much protein ? What about all these studies that say that needing a lot of protein is a myth , not to mention harmful for the kidneys ? What about fat being bad for the heart ? " Some people , " she said , " do n't need as much protein , they need less . Some people do n't need as much fat ; they need less . But you need more of both . " <p> Seventeen years of fasting followed by overeating followed by dieting had taken their toll . At 11 , when I should have been making sure that I was getting enough calcium to build strong bones , I was going on my first diet . At 15 , when I should have been eating enough protein and fat to sustain the feverish pace of adolescence , I started a 4-year stint on diet pills . At 25 , I was anorexic . At 27 , I 'd gained 80 pounds in 2 months . And although my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negligence  --  my legs had climbed mountains , my hands had written books , my heart had never stopped beating , opening , loving  --  it was just plumb worn out . <p> It appeared as if I were feeding my body , but what I 'd really been feeding was my mind , my reaction to my mother , my past wounds , and my present stress . The Moral of This Story <p> I 've been on this " diet " for 11 years . Sometimes I eat more sugar than is best , and sometimes I do n't follow the instructions at all , but I know what my body needs and how to provide for it . I will never have the robust health of someone who did n't gain and lose 1,000 pounds , but if I am mindful of what I put into my body , I thrive . <p> The story has an important moral : What you do to your body has consequences . I thought I got away with the month-long water fasts followed by weeks of eating nothing but Krispy Kremes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My health is fragile ; I had a premature , illness-induced menopause ; and I 've been diagnosed with osteoporosis . <p> If , when I was 11 , someone had told me that the way I was eating might cripple me at age 60 , I probably would have kept right on eating cookies for breakfast . And at age 20 , nutritional guidance probably would n't have stopped me from raw-food diets and the ensuing anorexia , but I still wish someone had told me . I wish I could have made an informed choice about the food I ate and the course I was charting for the rest of my life . <p> So , I 'll be the one to say it now . What you eat matters , not only to your size , but also to your health . Depending on your constitution , genetic background , environment , and temperament , the food you eat will skew your biochemistry in a particular direction , which will then affect the course of your life . This is not a prediction or a fear-based assumption ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can control and certain things you ca n't . However , if you need food for emotional reasons right now , and can not tolerate the thought of monitoring what you eat , it does n't mean that you are crazy or wrong , and will get cancer in 5 years . <p> Your job is to do your best at all times , to pay attention to what you eat and why , to treat yourself with kindness , and to act on your own behalf . Your job is to keep an open and tender heart , and to be aware of your limits . You need to know when to act and when to reflect . When to shore up on protein , vegetables , calcium , and fats  --  all those good , necessary things . And when to eat ice cream for breakfast and say , The hell with everything else . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : What you put into your body matters <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Geneen Roth <p> <p> Geneen Roth is the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Craggy Hole in My Heart and the Cat Who Fixed It . www.geneenroth.com <p>
