During one of his boozy , boisterous poetry reading tours of the U.S. in the 1950s , Dylan Thomas was asked how he felt about something or other " as a poet . " He replied , " I 'm only a poet when I 'm writing poetry . The rest of the time , I 'm ... well , Christ , look at me . " <P> He was n't a pretty sight . Tousled and bloated , he was drunk much of the time , playing the buffoon and getting into fights at bars and parties , making crude passes at women and cadging money and favors that he rarely repaid . As Andrew Lycett recounts in Dylan Thomas ( Overlook Press ; 421 pages ) , he spawned bad debts , pilfered from and vandalized homes he stayed in , and insulted and embarrassed the people who tried the most to help him . It would n't be long before he died of alcohol poisoning in New York City in 1953 , at the age of 39 . <P> Most of the works that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by the time he was 26 , including such poems as " The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower , " " And Death Shall Have No Dominion " and " When All My Five and Country Senses See . " After that he survived largely by playing the role of the errant romantic genius , though he did manage to produce Under Milk Wood , his enduringly popular play for voices , in his last years . After a teenage stint on a newspaper in his native Wales , the only paid work he found was giving talks on BBC radio , writing film scripts during World War II and going on his ruinous tours . But what a performer he was . In person he could be hilariously entertaining , at least until he vomited or passed out . Onstage , no matter how much he had had to drink , he unfailingly gave powerful readings in his sonorous , slightly hammy voice . <P> Countless women were eager to bed him and , in the case of the older and wealthier ones , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Friends , colleagues and hangers-on were willing to forgive him almost anything because of his gifts and because of an underlying innocent sweetness they saw in him . ( Not everyone , though : the young Kenneth Tynan described him as " a surly little pug , but a master of pastiche and invective . Thinks himself the biggest and best phoney of all time , and may be right . " ) <P> These people today would be called enablers , and none was worse than his tempestuous Irish wife Caitlin , who was as much a drunk and a brawler as he was . In seaside towns in Wales and the bohemian precincts of London , they made do in squalid lodgings , haphazardly raising three children , bickering violently and competing in infidelity . Lycett suggests that the main cause of Thomas ' self-destructiveness was his passionate , lethal co-dependency with Caitlin . <P> It 's a colorful and poignant tale , but in Lycett 's hands it goes on too long . The book would benefit from fewer pub crawls and more pointed analysis , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas once said , " I hold a beast , an angel and a madman in me . " Lycett gives us plenty of the beast and the madman . The angel is scarcely glimpsed.  --  By Christopher Porterfield
