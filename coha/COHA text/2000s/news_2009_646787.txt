HOLLYWOOD <p> Trading a woozy tingle for a restorative jolt , Bono and Edge abruptly switch from margaritas to coffee as they prepare to leave their hotel for a rehearsal stage in downtown Los Angeles . They grew accustomed to such giddy and pronounced mood swings while recording U2 's 12th album , No Line on the Horizon , a kaleidoscopic quest that rivals 1991 's Achtung Baby for audacity and innovation . <p> " We had to learn a lot before we could do this , " Bono , 48 , says . " Normally , you zone in on a particular area and make it your own . On this , we seemed to be able to meander from joy to despair , from introspection to exhibitionism . And there 's a lot of humor . I 'm surprised , because people do n't generally buy a U2 album for the laughs . <p> " There 's fun and frolics here . Real joy , and that 's the essence , the life force , of rock ' n roll . " <p> One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raves for brazen and byzantine sonic architecture that rises from U2 's familiar foundation of heartfelt rock . The 11-track disc , out Tuesday , found the Irish foursome recording in Morocco , then in Dublin and later in New York and London . The album closes the band 's longest gap between studio albums , following 2004 's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb , which sold 9 million copies worldwide and generated eight Grammys . <p> Edge , 47 , is relieved to emerge from what he calls the " oil rig " after a long spell of concentrated but isolating creativity with Bono , drummer Larry Mullen Jr . and bassist Adam Clayton . Horizon 's lengthy gestation was n't the result of setbacks or writer 's block , but rather a geyser of impulses and detours . <p> " We would have loved to finish the album last summer , but the songs were n't finished with us , " says Edge , sharing a couch with Bono in a Chateau Marmont bungalow cluttered with video gear . " Realizing there was more to this album than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three songs , finished up others . It would have been a darker record before . " <p> At Mullen 's urging , the band had no timetable and missed the lucrative fall release schedule . <p> By briefly considering a late 2008 release date , " we lost our way a bit , but when we blew out the deadline , we came back , " Bono says . " When anyone said , ' Look , we have to put this out , Larry said , ' Oh , it 's going to ruin everything . We were making music for its own sake and for each other , and Larry wanted to keep that as long as we could . It was a lovely thing to be lost in . " <p> More cloistered than on past efforts , the band " was n't thinking about who would be listening to the music in the future or how it would go over live , " Edge says . <p> Second disc on the horizon <p> After a leisurely recording pace , the band spent a frenzied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocal versions and lyric rewrites . <p> Tunes left behind , including the soulful Every Breaking Wave , are slated for a more meditative album due possibly by year 's end . U2 also is sitting on material from early sessions with Rick Rubin , benched after the band reconnected with longtime collaborators Brian Eno and Danny Lanois , who produced Horizon with Steve Lillywhite . <p> " Rick is a minimalist , which is about getting back to pure essence , " Bono says . " That 's the theme of this album lyrically , but musically , this is maximalist . He wants to make a U2 album that is hard as nails and tender as can be but musically bare-boned . There is a place for that . This was the time for experimentation , wanderlust and finding other colors . " <p> Edge says they are n't wed to any single formula . <p> " Rick is methodical , and I 'm excited about working in that style as well , " he says , noting that the songs he and Bono have been writing for next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require a more disciplined approach . <p> " There 's no strict route to a U2 song , " Edge says . " The only thing that 's consistent is the search for inspiration . It can start from a drumbeat , a guitar part , a title , a lyric . An entire piece of music can suddenly arrive . We subscribe to the idea that there 's no such thing as failure . There 's just giving up . We do not give up . We are relentless . " <p> U2 's tenacity and artistic daring pay off in Horizon 's towering splendor , says Blender editor Joe Levy . <p> " It combines two moments : the epic grandeur of The Joshua Tree and the experimental audio research of Achtung Baby and Zooropa , " he says . " They 're at a point where they can be the biggest band in the world and still be edgy , with a capital ' E in this case . They have n't come out swinging this hard and reaching this high since Joshua . On the surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you hear an album every bit as sonically ambitious as Achtung Baby . " <p> Horizon 's immediacy , nimble complexities and clear messages cement U2 's standing as the only veteran rock band with consistent artistic relevance and commercial clout , he says . <p> " They do n't do it by utilizing the same set of tricks or by having Justin Timberlake and Timbaland on speed-dial , " Levy says . " None of their ' 80s contemporaries  --  Madonna , Bruce Springsteen , Prince or Michael Jackson  --  managed to continuously keep the focus on new music . " <p> On the road , the band is eclipsed only by the Rolling Stones , whose Bigger Bang is history 's top-grossing tour with $558 million , according to Billboard Boxscore . U2 's Vertigo tour ranks second with $389 million , and the band will get another shot at the record book when it hits stadiums this summer , its first outdoor U.S. trek in 12 years . <p> " When U2 tours , it 's a major global live entertainment event , " says Ray Waddell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bands have achieved that sort of international touring superstar status . Though you hate to say anyone is recession-proof , U2 is about as close to that as you can get . It 's can't-miss entertainment . <p> " That said , any band would be foolish not to take into account economic conditions when mounting a major tour , and the U2 team is anything but foolish . " <p> Mediocrity ' would kill us <p> Sinking CD sales and the crumbling economy did n't dissuade U2 from gambling on stadiums ( the band nearly went broke staging the extravagant 1997-98 PopMart tour ) and plowing fresh turf on Horizon . <p> " The point was to get out of the comfort zone into uncharted territory , " Edge says . " We love it when we do n't know what we 're doing . We 're more alive . It has to be about discovery or we lose interest . <p> " Even so , no matter how far out we go , it always ends up sounding like U2 . " <p> Fan loyalty , critical acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve , but the band says its self-confidence is the first casualty during months of studio skydiving and spelunking . <p> " You do n't get this much attitude if you 're not insecure , " Bono says with a laugh . " Insecurity is our best security , and the moment we lose that insecurity , we 're in deep trouble . It 's important to be out of our depth . " <p> He recites a line from Cedars of Lebanon , a somber tune from the view of a war correspondent : " Choose your enemies carefully because they will define you . " <p> It 's a sly cautionary tag on a character study that reflects a collective regret and despair in today 's uneasy world . And it 's a U2 mantra . <p> " U2 never took on obvious enemies  --  pretending to sneer at fashion or the establishment , " Bono says . " They 're useless enemies . The more interesting enemies are your own hypocrisy , the obstacles to realizing your own potential . " <p> More than 30 years after forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone is willing to totally commit , " Edge says . " As long as our agendas are aligned and the singular band ego is bigger than our individual egos , we can go on . If that ever is no longer possible , we 'd pack it in . None of us could hack turning out mediocre records . It would kill us . " <p> Bono , the globe-trotting activist with demanding commitments worldwide , rediscovered U2 's value during a spate of separation anxiety . <p> " Because I 'm on my own in my other lives , I had an epiphany about how much I need to be in this band , " he says . " Over the years , you perhaps take for granted the opportunity to make music . I 'm very happy as an activist , but it 's a very demanding life , a slog , and it can be dirty work . This record put me back in the place I was as a teenager , working in a gas station , dreaming of getting to rehearsal with the band . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar or the silver sound of a cymbal . Maybe I needed to be reminded of that . " <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
