your family Headnote Hazing has become a violent part of high school life-even girls are getting into the act . What parents need to know . Photograph // When school let out for the summer on a crystalclear day in June 1999 , Adam Miller , * 14 , was feeling uneasy . It was his last day at Nicollet Junior High , in affluent Burnsville , Minnesota . And later that afternoon , Adam knew , he would have to endure a painful rite of passage for popular students about to enter Burnsville Senior High School . Adam was scared . At a party a month earlier , he 'd learned that his name was on " the list . " " Be available on June 10 , " he was told by an upperclassman , which meant he had been picked by the cool crowd at the high school to go through an initiation . The payoff if he survived ? He would automatically be accepted into the top social group . Though Adam had been anxious about the hazing for weeks , he was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't on the list , I 'd be a nobody , " he says today . " And if I tried to hide , they 'd just hunt me down . " So while other kids headed out to the lake for a barbecue or hit the basketball court , Adam and his friends wandered the streets near the junior high until they were spotted by some older boys in a pickup truck . Riding in the back of the truck , Adam and the other " chosen " ones were driven to a cul-de-sac , where more than a hundred teens had gathered to watch . Let 's just get this over with , Adam thought . So he volunteered : " Take me first . " Two 17-year-old football players pulled Adam out of the truck and made him drop his pants . Then they took turns whacking him with bats , hockey sticks , oars , and two-by-fours as the crowd egged them on : " Harder ! Harder ! " Just when Adam thought he could n't take it any longer , the older boys moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canoe paddle split in half as it smashed his backside . Later , some horrified eyewitnesses in the neighborhood called 911 . But by the time police arrived , the kids had scattered . Adam was in such pain , he could n't sit down for days . And he still has lower-back problems that flare up when he plays basketball-a constant reminder of the incident . AT HIGH SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY , HAZING HAS taken a violent turn . Once , hazing was just goofy escapades-kids getting drenched in ketchup or running around in costumes for a scavenger hunt . Today , the rituals can be downright cruel . And while hazing is often associated with college fraternities , the problem has drifted down to the high school level and increasingly affects kids as young as 12 or 13 . " The level of violence and humiliation is astonishing , " says Nadine Hoover , Ph.D. , coauthor of a recent Alfred University study that found that 1.5 million teens are hazed each year . " More than half of all hazing incidents involve dangerous or even criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still abound . But some students are now being forced to drink excessive amounts of alcohol and submit to paddling or beating . Other times , they 're ordered to shoplift or simulate sexual acts ; a few become victims of sexual assault . Influenced by TV and movies like Dazed and Confused ( a 1993 comedy featuring scrawny eighth graders being paddled by big football players at the end of the school year ) , many teens think initiation rites should be rough . " The peer pressure is so great that it clouds the thinking of kids who ordinarily have good judgment , and it distorts their sense of what it takes to be accepted , " explains Elizabeth Allan , Ph.D. , cofounder of StopHazing.org and a professor of education at the University of Maine in Orono . " The kids feel they must go along with the group . " Violence on the rise Sometimes , the victims literally have no choice . A 14-year-old junior varsity football player at Baldwin Senior High School in New York was getting dressed in the boys ' locker room last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the floor . One of the boys sexually assaulted the young player-a football-team " initiation " rite that students say has been going on for years . The victim told only one friend what happened , but soon teachers got wind of the story . Jonathan Martin and Nigel Dixon , both 17-year-old football players , were arrested and charged with firstdegree sexual abuse . Similar incidents used to be common at Trumbull High School in Connecticut : In March 2000 , a 15-year-old wrestler was hog-tied and forced into a locker while teammates attacked him . And months later , at Winslow High School in Holbrook , Arizona , seven high school athletes were sent to prison after being convicted of aggravated assault . " Parents need to become more educated about what hazing is to understand how serious it is , " Allan says . At least one student dies every year as a result of hazing . In October 2001 , James Brier , 16 , lost his life after being taunted for two months about a hazing incident . At a party in August , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed naked jumping jacks-all in hopes of being accepted into a high school Rotary club . He even had to endure students urinating on him . Following this humiliation , he was relentlessly teased . Finally , he got into a fight with one of the boys who was tormenting him , and this classmate , 17-year-old John Acosta , allegedly beat him to death . John was charged with manslaughter . These ugly incidents leave parents and school officials wondering : Why are these teens acting out in such brutal ways ? " The worst abusers are definitely on a power trip , " Allan says . " They feel they gain a sense of control by doing this to others . " Kids try to outdo one another every year , says Linda Murtie of Essex junction , Vermont , whose daughter was a victim of hazing . " They figure , we got away with it last year , ' and then it snowballs out of control , " she says . Often , students who survive tough hazing vow to make it even more severe once theyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often linked to football and wrestling teams . But in fact , 48 percent of students who join any organization-the band , theater club , even church groups-report being hazed . " Kids want to belong somewhere , " says Hank Nuwer , author of High School Hazing : When Rites Become Wrongs . " And they 're willing to put themselves in temporary danger in hopes of joining the group . " Even girls and younger teens are getting into the act . At first , the sophomores on the girls ' field hockey team at Northern Highlands Regional High School , in Allendale , New Jersey , took their lumps and kept quiet . At hockey camp in Estella , Pennsylvania , in August 2001 , senior girls forced the sophomores to bark like dogs , simulate oral sex on bananas , and play hockey with syrup in their pants . The older girls videotaped the sophomores in action . The hazing did n't end there . Back at school , the seniors played the video for the boys ' football and soccer teams . While the sophomores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Katie Ohnegian , noticed some of the girls crying on the sidelines at practice . The girls were reluctant to talk . But eventually they opened up . After an investigation , 14 senior girls were expelled from the team for the fall season . But parents of several seniors hired lawyers to challenge the decision to remove their daughters from the team ( which could have put the girls ' college admissions in jeopardy ) . Threats of litigation may stall efforts by the school to combat these incidents ; school officials declined to comment on the case . Like Northern Highlands , many schools do n't have the support they need from parents to make changes , Nuwer says . And some coaches may dismiss the problem as just kids being kids to avoid disrupting a team 's winning season . Ending the cycle Despite the suffering hazing victims endure , they 're often reluctant to tell parents or teachers what 's happening for fear of being branded a tattletale . The consequences for those who do come forward can be harsh . Picked for the " sophomore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosentino found herself surrounded by a drunken mob of about a hundred seniors who were breaking bottles over students ' heads . The next day , Nikki told her mother , Mary , who reported the incident . As soon as her classmates got wind of it , she became a pariah . " One day in the lunchroom , five seniors surrounded me , " Nikki recalls . " They told me they were going to slice up my face for revealing the secret . " A year later-after dealing with constant harassment from other kidsNikki and her mother moved to southern California . But before they left , the Cosentinos successfully lobbied the state to pass anti-hazing legislation . The 1998 law recognizes hazing as a crime and requires schools to establish an anti-hazing policy . At some schools , though , the policy was simply printed in handbooks , but never discussed or enforced . The law apparently was n't enough to help Adam Miller of Burnsville , Minnesota . After Adam 's mother , Karen , * discovered that her son had been beaten , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might have a child who was a victim . " Eventually 63 seniors were punished . Miller also came up with specific solutions . She convinced the school to install a hot line that students could call to report any hazing anonymously . And she recruited members of the Minnesota Vikings football team to pose for anti-hazing posters , which are now displayed throughout the school . " Sports stars are the kind of role models kids listen to , " she says . " Now these kids know that hazing is not normal and they do n't have to go through it . " - with additional reporting by Mary Kate Hogan Photograph how to protect your child from hazing * If your teen is joining a team or club , ask coaches , teachers , and your children 's friends whether there have been hazing incidents before . * Rally school officials and recruit other parents to ensure that an anti-hazing policy gets enacted-and enforced . * Push for more adult supervision . Some of the worst hazing incidents take place at overnight sports camps and during group outings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better . * Work with your child 's school to create more positive initiation rituals : for example , outdoor challenges like rope courses , hikes , and rafting trips , and social events such as welcome picnics and parties . * Talk to your kids . The tug to belong is strong , especially at this age . Make sure your children know that hazing is n't acceptable . * Lobby your lawmakers . While 43 states have anti-hazing statutes , some are weak and do n't cover high schools . Go to www.stophazing.org to find out what your state laws are . Then ask your legislators to pass anti-hazing bills or strengthen existing measures . // <p>
