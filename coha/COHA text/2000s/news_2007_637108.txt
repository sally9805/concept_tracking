<p> Everyone knows society has changed . But what about motherhood ? What are the qualities , character and skills needed to be a good mother in Gwinnett County in 2007 ? Are they timeless , the same as in generations past ? Or have they evolved as our world has changed ? AJC Gwinnett Opinions invited our Voice of Gwinnett panelists to tell us their opinions . <p> I am the mother of a 20-year-old male who graduated from college last week with a degree in mathematics . He did it in three years because I was there , making sure he succeeded and stayed focused because I knew his potential . <p> I do not believe motherhood has changed . Motherhood still requires four basic ingredients : <p> * First , your child or children 's needs come before yours . As a mother , you must be completely selfless . <p> * Secondly , a mother needs to let children be children . You can not burden your child with your personal drama . If you do , they will grow up to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third , guidance . As a mother , you must identify your child 's personality and guide the child to greatness . You must identify any potential defects and correct them . <p> * Finally , you must provide your child with unconditional love . This means making sure you know what is going on in your child 's life . You must stay involved until they become full adults . However , while showing you love them , you must be firm when it comes to bad behavior . You must immediately pinpoint potentially self-destructive behavior and correct it through discipline . <p> Motherhood is a very serious job ; it should not be entered into lightly . I do not believe motherhood has changed ; what has changed are our cultural norms . <p> When I was growing up , certain behavior was unacceptable . Now , some parents think bad behavior is cute . Well it is not cute . If you do not set a good example for your child , they will grow up to be destructive adults . <p> The key to motherhood is involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The qualities it takes to be a good parent are timeless . My mother raised me with all the basic ingredients I mentioned earlier . I passed them on to my son . I grew up to be a good person , as I am sure my son will be as well . <p> Our culture may change , but the qualities to be a good mother will never change . <p> CHERYL S. ROSS , Norcross <p> The essence of motherhood is to nurture your child to be the best person he or she can be . That has never changed ; what has changed is what it takes to accomplish this amazingly important joy . The effort needed and the way we do this has evolved over the years . <p> When women did not work outside the home and the environment children were growing up in was more " innocent , " character , ethics , honesty , diligence and self-value were important traits to teach children , and Moms had time to spend with their kids . Not just telling them to be good people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mothers are now often faced with raising children on their own and in a society that no longer places a high value on previously important traits , with little time for their children after coming home from their jobs then cooking , cleaning and helping with homework after a long commute . <p> Life is also so much busier than it used to be , leaving little time to spend with your kids when you have to compete with friends , Playstation , soccer , television and the telephone . Moms need to get the most out of the time they have to be with their children . <p> My daughter is fond of saying " Mom , you would n't make it a day in my school ! " when I talk to her about character traits to use for a good and happy life . She 's probably right . I believe in honesty and doing the right thing , even when it is unpopular , or when you do n't necessarily want to . Those are hard lessons to teach now , in our " if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I write this , I think of my own mother who worked as a single parent ( without the benefit of child support or state assistance ) and went without so that we did n't ; who worked at jobs she hated so that the bills would be paid ; and who pushed me constantly to be the better person she knew I could be . <p> I now know that mothers are the next best thing to angels even when they seem like the next worst thing to the devil . <p> CORI HOMER , Grayson <p> Boy , has motherhood changed  --  and for the worse . <p> I see more mothers these days that I just want to slap . I ca n't blame their spoiled children since they are doing what is expected of them by ignorant parents . The parents are supposed to be raising their children . Not letting their children raise them . <p> I 've been in plenty of restaurants or shopping and seen children acting like animals , running all around and eating like pigs . Children need discipline , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn cause and effect  --  responsibility for their actions , which can be taught at a very early age . <p> The parents keep looking at their child as if to say , " Where did he hear , see , learn that ? " like they had never seen the child before . <p> I was very lucky . My parents did n't interfere with any of my child-rearing decisions . My dad gave me some advice , which was my guideline for raising three happy , healthy , well-adjusted sons who are now raising my five grandchildren . His advice : Be consistent . If it 's wrong once , it 's wrong all the time . <p> BARBARA LIGHT , Dacula <p> I know I 'm not unique , but it hardly seems possible to me that only yesterday I was a very young mother and today I am a great-grandmother . <p> I have much to reflect upon . <p> Motherhood ? Though the care required and the skills needed to raise a child from infancy upward remain basically the same , we know there are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Safety and health , nourishment , love , play , instruction and discipline are as much in the mix as they ever were . But the world has changed , become so much more complicated and now offers the very young choices not even imagined in the past . <p> A mother must remain far more discerning regarding the physical , cultural and intellectual development of her children . Whether threats come from the street or from information filtering into the home from television and the Internet , a mother 's task is to choose wisely what is simply a matter of cultural change or is insidious and harmful . <p> Nothing , however , can take the place of love , bedtime stories and being the anchor of the home . <p> GERI TARAN , Lawrenceville <p> Motherhood has changed dramatically over the last 20 years . There are more single moms who are juggling careers and housework . <p> As far as society changing , there is still the old rival between stay-at-home and working moms . <p> Although my children are grown  --  19 and 24  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a 24-hour , seven-day-a-week , lifetime job ! <p> CYNDI DAVIS , Snellville <p> Mothers . God bless them all . <p> From the wonderful mothers who cherish and nourish their children to the mothers who have to live with the monsters they are rearing , motherhood remains a cornerstone of our culture . <p> Of course motherhood is changing in Gwinnett County . How could it not be responsive to the adult peer pressures of affluence , opportunity and self-fullfilment ? <p> In counterbalance to those challenges , which undermine the potential that a close-knit family can achieve , it does my heart good to see our newest residents pushing the strollers and holding hands with the toddlers as they take the long walk to the grocery store or wherever . <p> To me , motherhood is all about taking the time to nurture , to talk to , to instruct . <p> WILLIAM MAY , Lawrenceville <p> I think motherhood has become more complex because today 's children are more likely to believe friends instead of relying on parents who have learned enough to know the right answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for guidance and girls to their mother . <p> Today 's more libertine atmosphere creates a stronger need to have a caring mom watch over children . In addition , the potential to have a little one grabbed by a stranger is higher , and moms are the first line of defense in preventing that . <p> Yes , the basis for being a mom is still the same . The level of training from a mom 's parents is not always as good . <p> I feel I am lucky to have a wife who has instilled great values in our two daughters . They call frequently to check their logic and to share happenings involving their children . I am proud of that on behalf of both my wife and both of my daughters ! <p> GARY VON BEHREN , Lawrenceville <p> I believe the challenge of motherhood in 2007 is beyond multitasking  --  it is about having a multi-nature . <p> What I mean is , that since the dawn of civilization mothers have had to be multitaskers . Whether moms were watching the kids while picking berries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been essential . <p> Now , we are finding that roles are so mixed that a mother has to be disciplined and cautious and also be fun and spontaneous . Since most mothers have to bring in money to their family to live at a reasonable standard , they must possess marketable job skills . They also must find time to nurture their children while managing to keep the house in some sense of order . <p> I believe more and more women are feeling anxiety about the sacrifices they feel they make that take away from their direct impact on their children . They lack the programming to feel that their indirect efforts have a significant effect on their children 's lives . Men are more likely to have this programming . Unfortunately , in men , this can fool them into weighing indirect benefit higher than is warranted . <p> For mothers , bringing home the money and making sure the house is in order and the children are safe is just not enough . <p> I am proud of my wife , who occasionally pushes herself too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet she continues to try to do more , even though she knows intellectually that sacrifices in her time and energy are necessary . <p> I feel for the moms who do not have adult support in their efforts . I know the trade-offs must be painful , but I am glad they continue to push forward . <p> For the men in the lives of these mothers , I suggest supporting their efforts and helping them understand that they ca n't and do n't have to do it all . Men need to pick up the slack because being a mom in 2007 is an extreme challenge . <p> I think we need to give thanks and praise to the mothers who are meeting this challenge and winning . <p> JEFF FRY , Suwanee <p> My opinion is that motherhood in 2007 has drastically changed compared to previous years . <p> The rate of single mothers has skyrocketed for various reasons . Mothers have worn multiple hats throughout all generations , but increasingly , mothers are now the sole support of a large portion of the American family population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it forces women to push themselves beyond the limits of what a single human being should have to bear  --  all this to keep her family together . <p> Mothers of any era are phenomenal women , and I count myself as blessed to be a mother of two boys . <p> NAKISHA COCKFIELD , Lawrenceville <p> It should be evident to all that the values associated with being a mother are imprinted into the female personality and therefore instinctive . That is why we are so shocked when we read stories that deal with abuse and sometimes murder of children by their mothers . <p> The values and related duties of a mother are simple to list : Unconditional love , education of their children ( in all aspects of life ) and correction of unacceptable behavior . <p> The problems we are having with motherhood in our modern society are also self-evident : <p> 1 . A working mother can not fully fulfill her responsibilities if she is not with her child for most of the day , especially in the early formative years . She has to depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for the child . <p> 2 . Single working mothers also are hindered from exercising their educational and corrective duties well , if they must devote significant time and effort to tasks not directly related to motherhood , i.e. , home finances , home repair , civic , religious and social responsibilities <p> 3 . Our society places a premium on " organized activities " for children , which again removes them from direct interaction with their mothers and places greater responsibility on coaches or " volunteers " ( who most of the time are strangers to the child ) to communicate and impart their value systems to the child <p> I am afraid we are drifting into a society where the education and upbringing of a child will largely be in the hands of institutions , and where parents will have less and less contact and influence on their children 's formation . The constant assault on the traditional family unit , with well-defined roles for the mother , father and children , is resulting in greater chaos in our society . <p> I do not see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governmental or judicial institutions . May God help the United States of America . <p> ALBERT J. BOLET , Lilburn <p> As a biological mother of two adult children , I have witnessed the change in parenting . <p> The qualities I believe to be pertinent to instill true character in our children would be passion , persistence and patience . <p> There must be a passion for motherhood , which grows within our experiences and challenges . <p> Persistence coupled with endurance I believe is timeless , for throughout the many decades of cultural change , maintaining a stable relationship with your children is of most importance . <p> Last but certainly not least , patience . Patience is the ingredient in motherhood that causes us to listen for the heartbeat of the fluttering we feel . Patience is the waiting for the phone to ring from the agency through which we are adopting . Patience is waiting in the corrider while a stitch is removed from a skinned knee . Patience is holding your child when his or her heart is broken , and you wish and pray you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your son or daughter to return home from a tour in the armed forces . <p> Do I believe these qualities and characteristcs have changed over the years ? No . I believe they have increased and magnified with the heart of each mother . <p> DR . B.J. RELEFOURD , Lawrenceville <p> Today , a mother has to be many things to her family . Mom is no longer the preparer of meals and checker of homework ; she has to also be the role model and example for what she desires her children to become . <p> I personally think that the changes I have made are sort of retroactive . The world around us is so progressive in both good and bad ways . To keep a sense of balance , I have adopted methods that were more common in the ' 50s . For example , we have game night where we play games or put on skits . Sunday is Family Day , when we share worship and a meal with family and friends . I prepare goodie bags for the kids in the neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchful eye that allows them to be carefree and play as children . <p> My children are required to volunteer at least once a month to give back to the community , give away toys they no longer play with , donate their too-small clothing to a worthy cause and collect food for the local pantry . <p> I was raised to believe that " If you contribute nothing , you get nothing . " I know that children who feel their life matters spend less time on things that do n't . <p> CRYSTAL OLIVER , Lawrenceville <p> Personally I am very proud of the " stay-at-home " moms today . <p> This is how it used to be with motherhood , the mom was always there to get the children off to school and be there for their safe return . In addition , she was there to hear about their day and know their friends and activities first hand . <p> I think this is one of the major things that has changed motherhood today , with many women returning to the work force and their career as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for them . <p> I know many moms have to work today to make ends meet , and it is a necessity of life . I respect this , and wish they did not have it so hard . <p> GERRY DEE , Buford <p> When I was raising my two sons in the ' 70s and ' 80s , I was very concerned that they were going out into a world where I could n't go . I could n't know all their friends , their teachers , where they might go when they got their driver 's license . <p> I grew up in a small town of 20,000 where everybody knew everybody , and if I did anything wrong , it would get back to my parents eventually ( usually ) . <p> Here in the metro area , I felt like my sons were walking into a mine field every day when they went off to school or to social functions . Who would teach them to do and say all the things I had tried to teach them not to do or say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city when I thought they were just going to the movies in Gwinnett County ? <p> My husband and I made a point of knowing our kids ' friends and their parents . We took them to church every week . We let them drive down to Atlanta First Baptist Church ( in Midtown ) for the mid-week youth meeting when the oldest had just gotten his driver 's license . I was afraid , but my thought was , " Lord , this is where they need to be to learn how to function in this world . Please take care of them . " And He did . They were in the youth band , and I knew they would go anywhere to play in a band . <p> I prayed constantly . <p> One day , I miraculously found out that one of them was trying marijuana , and my husband and I were able to take action . The year this son was a freshman at the University of Georgia , he came home on the weekend and said , " Mom , these kids are wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and do n't go to classes . " I remembered back to the time that he had done the same thing , only one year before . <p> I believe that God , through my prayers , kept our sons safe , and today they are upstanding , God-fearing citizens , as are their wives . They are raising their children the same way that we raised them . <p> I am thankful that I do n't have children to raise now , as things are so much worse  --  drugs , gangs , sex  --  all much more prevalent than when our sons were growing up . I think that the next time if I had to raise children , I would move to a very small town or a farm and home school my children ! <p> SUSAN COKER , Lilburn <p> Motherhood has changed totally in the way that men are helping out with everything  --  from changing diapers to cooking , baby sitting , carpooling lines , grocery shopping , cleaning house , doing laundry . That was a no-no in the baby boomers ' generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical to see . <p> This can be a grand thing for the kids and for the spouse or partner . A huge welcome ! <p> To be a good mother today , one must really network with other parents at school and in the neighborhood and watch out for unlawful people . ... Things are going on today that were never happening in the old days . <p> Internet , television , wheels , affluent families and immigration have really changed things , and children feel greater stress , pressure and are knowledgeable about many more things . Parents ' jobs are harder at home than at work . <p> Also , parents in most households work now , so it 's a big job to get in doing homework , after-school activities , healthy snacks , meals , errands and chores at home . <p> ... We all can do it together if we become more involved and aware . <p> PHYLLIS CHAMBERS , Lilburn <p> LET 'S HEAR FROM YOU <p> The Voice of Gwinnett is a panel of Gwinnett residents who answer online questionnaires on various topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voice of Gwinnett is not a scientific poll in which all respondents are randomly selected .
