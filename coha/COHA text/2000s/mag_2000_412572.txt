I WANT TO GET A SPEEDING TICKET ON MY BIKE FOR BRAGGING RIGHTS . ANY ADVICE ? Go to Bem , Switzerland . Visit the PumpZemUp druggist on the corner of Rostistrasse and Kublerstrasse . Walk to the counter in the back . Ask for Hein . Hand him a JFK silver dollar and 1,000 Swiss francs . Stuff what he gives you in your dop kit and head back to the States . You 're on the fast track to fame , fortune and an early death in your sleep . If you ca n't afford a plane ticket to Switzerland : Get a good coach . WHAT THE LAW SAYS ABOUT SPEEDING ON A BIKE ? " Technically , the speed limit for bikes in Central Park is 15 mph , but it 's not posted anywhere . The Parks Department posted signs years ago , but they 've been destroyed or taken . We 've enforced it on occasion , but certainly not all the time . It 's basically left up to the officers on patrol . " - Detective Jim Seifert , NYPD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and far between . If the cyclist is riding safely and following the laws , we allow him to go about his business . But when someone 's flagrant about it and is causing problems , he 's subject to citations . We 're not going to chase someone who 's going 30 in a 25 , but let 's say he 's going downhill-we 've got Baseline Road which is fairly steep and a real straight shot-the speed limit there is 35 , and we 've clocked cyclists as high as 70 mph . That 's twice the posted limit , so we do pull them over and give a summons . " - Sergeant Mason , Boulder , Colorado , Police Department Is heaven different for roadies and mountain bikers ? Yes . Gino Bartoli and Fausto Coppi are in road-bike heaven and that makes all the difference , my friend . Everyone in road-bike heaven rides 32-C Clement Campione del Mundo tubulars and GEL 280 rims . They do n't get road rash and , unlike those of us here on earth , they can get Campy spare parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place altogether . Cook Brothers cruisers , snake-belly tires , Tioga T-bone stems , perforated Turbo saddles and Mavic 231 rims . Oh , yeah , let 's not forget the wafting clouds of smoke . Would you say fluorescent colors are only to be worn during hunting season ? Look , hunters do n't shoot bikers by mistake , they shoot ' em because they 're bored and drunk . Do you understand the kind of mind-fogging a man experiences in the woods ? On a cold day when it 's just him and his gun , his 12 of Oly and maybe a stinky dog ? That type of sadness , my friend , is motivation-to shoot anything that moves . Now you see the absurdity of wearing neon Lycra : It actually decreases your chance of survival . My recommendation would be to wear the best camouflage gear you can get your hands on , maybe even lather up with a combination of fox urine and stale beer .
