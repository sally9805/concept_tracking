Salisbury , Wiltshire December 1942 They had been driving in silence for twenty minutes . Winterbotham 's eyes were beginning to drift shut , despite his best efforts to keep them open , when Colonel Fredricks suddenly said , " You know , Professor , you 're not at all what I expected . " For a few moments , Winterbotham considered letting it pass . He knew what the colonel meant , and he was n't in the mood for a fight . He was too goddamned tired . But then his pride-his old bedraggled pride , never knowing when to stay down-forced him to respond . " How do you mean , Colonel ? " he asked . The colonel let out a small chuckle . " I had been led to expect a sort of wildcat , I suppose . " Winterbotham looked out his window for another moment before answering . The countryside drifted past in absolute darkness ; he could n't make out even the top of the tree line . For the previous two years , all of England had been shutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they served their purpose , these voluntary blackouts ; they made it difficult for the Luftwaffe to find their targets . But they also took a toll , one that was purely psychological but very real . Hitler had n't won the war , not yet-but he had forced them to live in darkness , like animals in caves . Then Winterbotham turned his head slowly to look at the man sitting beside him in the gloom . Colonel Fredricks was a tall , pallid man who resembled a cadaver . In the darkness , Winterbotham could see only a pale smudge , which would have been his face . " A wildcat , " he mused . " So I had been warned . " " I 'm sorry to disappoint you . " " Oh , don'tapologize , Professor . It is my great pleasure to find you ... " He trailed off . " Manageable ? " Winterbotham said . " Yes , " Fredricks said , relieved . " That 's exactly right . " " You thought I would demand to know where we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip as unpleasant for you as possible . " " It had occurred to me . Yes . " " So it must have been Taylor who sent you . " Fredricks did n't answer . " Taylor has always overestimated me , " Winterbotham said , and allowed himself a thin smile at the man 's silence . " I 'm afraid I can't- " " I have n't demanded to know our destination , " Winterbotham said , " because I already know our destination , Colonel Fredricks . We 're going to a small nondescript house somewhere in the countryside , correct ? I ca n't see that it much matters if I know the precise location or not . Once we 've arrived , we 'll meet with my old friend Professor Andrew Taylor , correct ? And he will explain the reason for this rather bizarre invitation you have extended me , correct ? " Again , no answer . " I have n't asked you what the matter is , " Winterbotham said , " for the simple reason that you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel ? You 're his retriever , but you do n't know what you 're retrieving , let alone why , correct ? " Fredricks cleared his throat . " We 're nearly there , " he said stiffly . Winterbotham turned and looked out his window again , feeling vaguely satisfied . He knew they were near Salisbury because he spotted the extraordinary , unmistakable spire of the gothic cathedral-a stab of darkness just slightly darker than the sky behind it-shortly before they stopped . The car pulled up outside a small Tudor house that stood among a row of similar houses , modest dwellings all , with crossed slats of honey-colored wood on the peaked roofs . Winterbotham waited for Colonel Fredricks to open his door for him , then stepped out into the night , trying to keep his teeth from chattering . A bitter wind immediately took his chestnut hair and increased its disarray . He pulled his tweed jacket more tightly around himself , crinkling his eyes against motes of flying dust . The room they entered had a claustrophobically low ceiling ; it smelled of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackling fire in a stone hearth . Blackout shades had been drawn over the windows nonetheless . A wireless radio somewhere , turned low , was playing softly " She 's Funny That Way . " Winterbotham had guessed right : Andrew Taylor was sitting in one of two easy chairs by the fireplace . He rose as they came into the room , and offered his hand . He was a man of a certain age , like Winterbotham himself , and , like Winterbotham , he was a man of a certain weight , even in the midst of wartime rationing . Winterbotham had not seen Taylor for several years , not since they 'd been teaching together at the university . His first impression was that the man looked older , more haggard , more harried . His second was that he also looked healthier , in a strange way : His eyes were sparkling , and his handshake was firm . The war was doing him good , Winterbotham realized . Sometimes you found people like that ; these dark days brought out the best in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones who thrived on conflict . " Evening , old chap , " Taylor said . " They found you . " " That they did . In my bath . " " Sorry about that , Harry . Come in , have a seat . Thank you , Colonel . That will be all . " Colonel Fredricks executed a courtly half bow , then stepped back out through the front door and closed it behind himself . " You 've got him well trained , " Winterbotham remarked . " Not I. It 's the Royal Artillery who trained him so well . Tea ? " " Something stronger , if you 've got it . " Winterbotham settled down in one of the easy chairs beside the fire . A marble chessboard had been set up on a table between the chairs . He inspected it with a small smile . Perhaps Taylor had dragged him all the way out here simply because he was hungry for a good game of chess ... although he rather doubted it . Taylor handed him a chipped mug and sat opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised the mug and sniffed suspiciously . Whiskey . He took a sip into his mouth and rolled it around . Not just whiskey , but good whiskey . How long had it been since he 'd had good whiskey ? " You 're looking well , " Taylor said . Winterbotham glanced at him with a raised eyebrow-he knew how he was looking , and well had nothing to do with it-and drank some more of the good whiskey without comment . Taylor seemed content to let the quiet linger . The fire crackled and the wireless hummed and a whistle of wind rustled through the eaves of the house . Presently , Winterbotham turned his attention to the chessboard . The ranks were arranged in starting position . He reached out , took the king 's pawn between thumb and forefinger , and moved it forward two spaces . The king 's pawn opening , so simple , so workable , had always driven Taylor mad with frustration . Taylor felt that every move in a chess game , as in life , should be a feat of brilliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job well done if there was not some element of spectacle . Taylor leaned forward , rubbing his chin , and then countered with the knight 's pawn-nothing ever could be simple with him . He said , " I did n't bring you here to play chess . " " I did n't think so , " Winterbotham said , bringing a bishop out . " I heard about Ruth , " Taylor said . " I 'm sorry , Harry . " Winterbotham nodded without looking up . " Any word on her ? " Taylor pressed . " Any hope ? " Winterbotham shrugged . " There 's always hope , " he allowed . In Ruth 's case , however , there was n't much . She had gone to Warsaw , despite Winterbotham 's warnings , in the summer of 1939 . She had family there-two brothers , assorted cousins-and she had been determined to convince them to come out before it was too late . But by the time she arrived , it already was too late . Hitler and his SS squads marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or imprisoned ; Winterbotham had no way of knowing . But her chances , as he long ago had admitted to himself , were not good . He remembered that Taylor had a wife of his own . He could n't quite recall her name . Alice , he thought , or possibly Alicia-or possibly Helen , probably Helen . He took a chance . " How 's Helen ? " Taylor was staring at the chessboard . " She 's passed on , " he said . " Nearly two years now . " " The bombs ? " " Tuberculosis . " " I 'm sorry , Andrew . " " Mm , " Taylor said . For ten minutes , then , they played without speaking . Taylor tripped himself up , as was his habit , with his own ambition . He played dramatically , unwilling to take the time to build simple defenses , always looking for an unexpected cross- board coup . Winterbotham whittled him down pawn by pawn , then split his king and his rook , nabbed the rook , and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whiskey and waited to be offered another . Finally , Taylor tipped his king over and laid it down in resignation . " The more things change ... " he said with a sour smile . " Care for another drink ? " " I wo n't refuse . " " I did n't think you would . So , old chap , still teaching ? " " You must know that I 'm not . " " I do know that , as a matter of fact . But I 've been unable to discover exactly what it is that you are doing . " " Very little , " Winterbotham said . " Locking myself in the library with my books , for the most part . Except when I 'm being mysteriously interrupted during my bath and dragged out into the countryside . " " That 's a shame , " Taylor said . " A bloody shame . " He had fetched the bottle ; now he refilled the mugs and then sat again , looking at Winterbotham contemplatively . " It 's a waste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " England could use you . Now more than ever . " " The way she uses you ? " " Mm , " Taylor said . " It does seem to agree with you-whatever it is that you 're doing . " " Mm . " " Bringing your extensive knowledge of the classics to bear on the Nazis , " Winterbotham said . " What scares them the most , Andrew ? Chaucer ? Or is it Shakespeare ? " " You 're digging , " Taylor said , smiling . " I 'm curious . I do n't understand exactly how elderly professors like ourselves are of service to His Majesty in wartime , I 'll admit . " " How curious are you ? " " Mildly . " " Curious enough to want to know more ? " " I would n't have asked otherwise . " " Honestly , old chap , I wish I could tell you everything I 'm doing . But I 'm afraid that 's not possible . " " Yet you did n't bring me out here just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then why ? " Taylor chewed on his lip for a moment . " There was a time , " he said slowly , " when you were not eager about this war . " Winterbotham said nothing . " You were rather vocal with your opinions , " Taylor said . " Extremely vocal , as I recall . What was it you called Churchill ? " " You know very well , " Winterbotham said crisply . " Of course I do . You called him a warmonger . You do n't have many friends in my sphere , old chap , I 'll tell you that . Do you know what they call you ? " " I could hazard a guess . " " Go ahead . " " Something along the lines of an appeaser . " " Right again , " Taylor said . " You 'd have been happy to sit back and watch Hitler take all of Europe , they say , just as long as we were left out of it . Let Germany and Russia take care of each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's king resting on its side . He took a long drink from the mug in his hand . A dark shadow crossed his face . " We all make mistakes , " he murmured . " That we do . " " Perhaps that was one of mine . " " Perhaps it was . " " Are you telling me , Andrew , that you ca n't tell me what you do because of my politics ? " " I 'm telling you that I need to be very careful with what I tell you , old chap , because of your politics . In fact , I 'm taking quite a risk just by meeting with you . " " So I should be flattered . " " You should be . " " Then I am . I 'm sincerely flattered . Now , tell me : What can I do for you ? " " Same old Winterbotham , " Taylor said . " Too impatient for his own good . " " Same old Taylor , " Winterbotham answered . " Too fond of games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in a new age now , Harry . We 're fighting a new kind of war . Games are what we do . " Winterbotham waited for elaboration . " We 're always looking for qualified men , " Taylor said , " to help us win the games we play . " " What sort of games , exactly ? " " Ah ! " Taylor smacked his hands together . " That 's the rub , is n't it ? The nature of the game is the game . I ca n't tell you anything without telling you everything . And I ca n't tell you everything , old chap , until I 'm satisfied that you 're on our side-completely . " Winterbotham drained the mug in his hand . " My time may be worthless these days , " he said , " but it 's all the time I have . You know whose side I 'm on , Andrew . Get to the point . " " You do n't understand , Harry . If I tell you what we 're up to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're with us or you 're not . And if you 're not ... " He hesitated , looking at the fire . " If I 'm not ? " " If I choose to bring you into this and it does n't work out , you could not be allowed to ... remain at liberty . " " I see . " " And I 've no wish to deny you your liberty , old chap . " " Of course not . " " So I would need to be absolutely certain , before I could tell you any more , that you are the right man for the job-that you will do whatever is required of you . " " I suppose , " Winterbotham said , " that I could n't promise that until I knew what would be required of me , could I ? " Taylor shook his head . " That wo n't do . " " It 's the best I can offer . " " Then I 've wasted your time . I 'm sorry to have brought you out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up suddenly and began to move toward the front door , leaving his drink by the chessboard . " I 'll have Fredricks take you back . And I 'd appreciate it if you did n't mention- " " This is hardly fair , Andrew . " " What ? " " You ca n't expect me to offer my services if I do n't know what I 'm volunteering for . " " Perhaps not . Well , then , I 'm sorry to have- " " Surely you can give me a clue . " " I 'm afraid not . " He opened the front door , paused , and then turned to look at Winterbotham . " Have a think on it , Harry , " he suggested . " Colonel Fredricks will give you my card . Ring me if you change your mind . " Winterbotham looked back at him for a moment , without moving . Then he stood , formally , and buttoned his tweed jacket . He stepped out past Taylor without saying a word , and made for the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door behind him . The man who had been listening from the next room stepped in . " I told you , " the man said , " he does n't want to have anything to do with it . He just wants to sit it out . " Taylor shook his head . " Bloody hell , " he said .
