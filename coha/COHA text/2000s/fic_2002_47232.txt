British writer Graham Joyce is the author of seven novels , including The Tooth Fairy , Requiem , and Indigo . His latest book , Smoking Poppy , is due out by the time this issue comes off the presses . The novel is set on the borders of Thailand and Myanamar among the opium-growing , spirit-worshipping hill tribes with whom Mr. Joyce lived for some time . His rare short fiction has appeared mostly in British magazines such as Interzone and New World . Fortunately , a collection entitled Partial Eclipse and Other Stories is due out later this year from Subterranean Press , who also published this story in chapbook form . We 're delighted to bring it to you now . <p> HALF HIDDEN BEHIND A thicket of hawthorn and holly bushes was a second cave . It astonished him to see it there . As a kid Andy had scrambled over every boulder , probed every fissure and crevice , and swung from the exposed roots of every tree clinging to the face of Corley Rocks . Yet here was a new cave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for the afternoon . After feeling the mild tremor , Andy needed to get home . But something in this new cave called to him . Unlike the first cave , a mere split in the rock face that had always been there , this one was dome-shaped , with an arched chamber as an entrance . He drew closer . As he squeezed between the hawthorn and prickly holly to get into the cave , it became obvious to him that this second cave went back much deeper . He could see well enough for the first few yards , but after that the cave shadows set hard in a resinous black diamond . Still it called . He wanted to move deeper in , but his throat dried and his breathing came short . He rolled his foot in the blackness . A pebble crunched under his shoe . There was a tiny light , no bigger than a glow-worm , swinging at the rear of the cave . It flickered and went out . Then it appeared again . The light shimmered , still swinging slightly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then there appeared in the gloom a second light , smaller than the first , and nearer the cave floor . The lights were approaching . Then there was a sound like the low growl of an animal , and it made him think of that dog . That dog , slavering and throwing itself at the fence , chewing the thick wire mesh . A brute of an Alsatian , but the drooling jaws and yellow teeth had Andy convinced it was part wolf . Andy always kept one eye peeled for the dog while the other , of course , was alert for Bryn 's father . Bryn appeared in his socks . " It 's all right , " he said . " He 's not here . " Andy crossed the swarthy yard and removed his shoes at the threshold of the kitchen . Shoes off at the door because of the coal dust . Everyone . The house and yard once belonged to a coal merchant who 'd gone bust , and the cinder path leading to Bryn 's house was black . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal dust had even pointed up the cement between the black-red bricks . They had to take off their shoes so as not to trail black dust into the house . Bryn had developed a lazy habit of not bothering to put on his shoes merely to cross the yard , even though his father , with a bunched fist , had once made his ear bleed for this offense . " Twenty minutes before he gets back . " The boys went through the kitchen . Bryn 's mother Jean looked up from her ironing . " Still down there then , your dad . " " Yes , " said Andy . " Twenty-four hours now . " " Yes . " " They got oxygen . They got food to them . They 'll get him out . " She pressed her iron into a collar and a jet of steam wheezed into the air . The two boys went upstairs to Bryn 's room , where they got the rope , the water bottle , and the tiny brass compass . They did n't want to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back off shift . Sometimes when they played table football or lounged in Bryn 's bedroom , the door would open quietly and Bryn 's mother would whisper , " He 's back . Make yourself scarce . " And with that they always would . Once when Andy awaited Bryn in the kitchen , Ike had come in from work and imposed himself in the doorway , glowering . Andy had felt compelled to look away . Without saying a word to Bryn 's mum , the big man slumped in an armchair before the fire , and how the chair-springs had groaned . Ike 's skin glowed pink with the scrubbing from a recent shower at the pit , but his body still leaked the odor of coal . A smell like a sulfurous gas , streaming off the man as he stared moodily into the fire . He snorted at the coal-dust irritating his sinuses , hawked and spat into the fire , and this movement released a fresh wave of hostile gas . Andy had on that occasion feared that even breathing might cause offense . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had both vented huge sighs . OF COURSE THEY did n't need the compass to find their way to Corley Rocks . A matter of a mile and half from the mining estate , Corley Rocks was the highest natural point in the old county of Warwickshire . The ploughed earthworks of an Iron Age encampment moldered on the flat field above an outcrop of red sandstone rock , and from there you could take in the green belt of land all around . To the south stood the two giant wheels of the pit-head winding gear , and beyond that the spires and smoking chimneys of Coventry . The dog started up again . " Shut it , " Bryn growled as they left the house . " Shut it . " It was exactly the way Andy had heard Bryn 's old man speak to the dog , half song , half warning , and it was always effective in subduing the animal . Except when Andy or anyone else tried , in which case the dog simply became more inflamed , hurling itself with stupid energy against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a killer ? " Andy said as they walked up the black cinder path away from the house . " Probably . " Bryn hooped the rope across one shoulder . " You carry the water bottle . " The rope was usually for display only . They 'd never done any real climbing at Corley Rocks . Everywhere was accessible by scrambling over the smooth , rounded edges of the sandstone . There was only one place where a rope might be helpful , at the sheer face of the rock above the cave , and Bryn was keen to try it . And it had to be admitted : looped across the torso from left collarbone to right hip , the rope looked a treat . Andy was envious , because carrying the water bottle was shit . But the rope was Bryn 's after all . They had to pass the entrance to the mine , with its weighbridges and security gates . " Do n't think about it , " Bryn said . " They 've got air . And food . They 'll get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the time they reached the rocks they were sweating and had drunk all of the water . The cave was merely a fissure , a crack opened in the rock face , but it could be reached by the means of small cavities scooped out of the soft stone , ancient handholds and toegrips . They climbed up and retreated to the back of the cave , welcoming the shade . Their schoolteacher had said that traces of prehistoric habitation had been found at the cave : flints , stone tools , bones . Someone had even unearthed a huge sabre-tooth , currently being examined by experts at Coventry museum . People had always lived there , it was said , and before that the rocks themselves had been pushed up by fault lines in the vast coal reservoirs under the ground : the very coal that Andy and Bryn 's fathers now mined on a daily basis . Bryn lifted the rope from his shoulders , causing his T-shirt to ride up . Andy saw below Bryn 's ribcage the flowering of a huge blue and yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own dad grew in the garden . He said nothing . He knew . Bryn knew he knew . And it was none of his business ; that 's what Andy 's mother had said to his father . " Not your business , Stan , to go getting tangled up in , " Nina warned her husband . " Not your business at all . " Andy 's father had wanted to go down to Bryn 's house to have words . Bryn had turned up one afternoon while Andy 's dad dribbled water from the garden hose on his prize-winning leeks . For the old giggle Andy 's dad put his finger over the hose and jet-sprayed the two boys . The giggling stopped when the lads stripped off their wet T-shirts . " Hell , you 've been in the wars , have n't you ? " Stan said , turning back to his leeks . Then he did a double-take , looked harder , and laid down the hose . Taking in the multiple bruises on the lad 's body , he stepped closer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bryn danced away . " Nothing . Fell off a ladder . " " Come here , I said . Stand still . Christ , son ! Hell 's bells ! " He brushed the wounds gently with his callused fingertips . Then he said , very quietly , " Must have been a good few times you fell off that ladder . " " Yeah , " Bryn sniffed . Andy 's mother , who 'd seen all of this , came out with a clean T-shirt apiece for the lads . Stan was already halfway down the path . She chased after him . " You 're not going down there . Not your business ! " Stan had himself once clouted Andy with a closed fist , but only once , and some years ago . Not a single day had passed when he had n't regretted it . " I 'll be back sharpish . " " You 're not going down there ! " Stan pulled up short . " I said I 'll be back sharp , " he whispered in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back garden , where the boys had their heads down and hose was still dribbling water onto the leek-bed . WITH THE DOG going berserk behind the mesh fence Stan had knocked on the door and had taken a step back . It was some moments before Ike Thompson appeared blinking in the doorway , puff-eyed , looking like he 'd just been disturbed from a nap . His eyes were lined with coal-dust like a woman 's mascara . He sniffed . " Stan , " he said . " A word in the yard , Ike ? " Stan turned his back and walked into the open expanse of the disused coal merchant 's yard . Ike shuffled in the doorway , slipped on his boots without lacing them , and followed Stan across the yard . The men knew each other well enough . They 'd mined the same districts , notably the 42s and the 56s ; they nodded to each other whenever their paths crossed ; they 'd even once been part of the same Mine Rescue Team ; and they knew that their boys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two miners stood in the cinder-black yard at a distance of about five paces . The dog was barking mad , flinging itself at the fence . " Your Bryn 's up at our house just now . " Ike was a big man . His grizzled face bore the blue signature scars of coal mining , like someone had scribbled on his face with a ballpoint pen . He stood a head taller than Stan . But Stan was trunk-necked with a barrel of a chest and muscle packed like coiled wire . He had his own mining scar , a blue and white star right in the middle of his forehead , like a bullet-wound . Ike lifted a hand to his mouth , squeezing his bottom lip between a coal-ingrained thumb and a coal-ingrained forefinger . " Yup . It " Says he fell off of a ladder . " Ike let his hand drop now he knew what this was about . He glanced to the side , and then back at Stan . " Yup . " The Alsatian barked , and slavered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesh fence . " He wo n't he falling off that ladder again , now will he , Ike ? " Ike turned to the dog , and in a low , throaty voice , almost a hiss , said , " Shut iiiiiiiiitttttttttt . " The dog lowered its head and crept back into its kennel . " That it ? " said Ike . " That 's about it . " " Right . You can go now . " " Happen I will go . But if that lad should fall off another ladder , then I 'll come down here again . And we 'll have another talk . More serious . " " Oh aye ? " " Too right , we will . Too right . " The two men stood off each other for another minute . Then Stan said , " I 'll be seeing you , Ike . " Stan retraced his steps along the cinder path . He felt Ike 's gaze drilling into him at every step . " Stop thinking about it , " Bryn said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out . " Andy knew they would get his dad out all right . He just wished everyone would stop telling him . He had n't been allowed to go up to the pit-head , where the wives and grown-up sons and daughters and the rescue teams and the camera crews all congregated , waiting . It had been twenty  --  fours hours since a roof had collapsed half a mile underground , trapping seven miners , one of whom was Stan . The rescue teams had made an early breakthrough , piping air and passing food through to the trapped men , but the rescue efforts had hit a snag when a second roof-fall had threatened . Ike was on one of the rescue teams . " They 're right under here , " Bryn-said . " Right under this spot . " " How do you know that ? " " My old man told me . He said the seam runs north and under these rocks . " Andy thought about his own dad half a mile directly below him , waiting . " You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying . " " Dust in my eye . Dust . " Andy 's fingers found a flake of red stone . He flung it from the back of the cave into the crack of light , and it dropped , skittering down the slope . " Anyway you would n't care if anything happened to your old man . " Andy wished he had n't said that . Bryn started whipping the end of his rope . " He might be a shit but at least he .... " " At least he what ? " " Nah . Come on . Let 's climb the Edge . " The boys scrambled out of the cave and walked up to an outcrop of red stone known as the Witch 's Face . Bryn hoisted himself over the chin and nose of the Face and wanted to use the rope to get Andy up . Andy objected on grounds of pointlessness . From there they proceeded to the Edge , a cliff overhang directly above the cave . At least he what ? Andy thought as they clambered up the steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day Stan had brought home a second-hand guitar . Andy had pestered Stan for this guitar , but when it arrived he soon found out that the strings cut his fingers to shreds . He 'd taken the guitar down to Bryn 's house , and he was exhibiting it to Bryn when Ike appeared unexpectedly , standing in the kitchen doorway , sniffing back coal-dust . His eyes fell on the guitar . Ike walked across the kitchen without removing his boots , gently lifting the guitar from the lad . " What you got here then , lovely boy ? Let 's have a look , then . " Ike sat , effeminately crossed his legs , positioned the guitar across his thigh , and gently thumbed the strings . He played a chord or two and the dog in the yard howled . Ike laughed . " Hear that ? " He strummed a few more chords and then picked out a tune . " Christ , these strings stand too high off the frets . You 'll never play this , lovely boy . Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " My dad got it for me , " Andy said , meaning to sound defensive . Ike laid the guitar down . " Come on lads , get in the car . " " Where you going ? " Jean had protested . " Get in the car , boys ! " Where they went , in Ike 's beat-up old Ford Zephyr , was Chaplin 's music store . Ike spent most of the journey explaining to Andy how he used to have a guitar - two guitars , even - but when Bryn and his sister had come along , why , there was no time , no bloody time to play them , and he 'd always regretted selling the instruments , and now he was going to put that right . He talked like that all the way round the music shop , non-stop ; he insulted the shop manager ; tried out every second-hand guitar in the store ; crooned passionately to other customers ; purchased . right off two decent instruments for the boys ; and had a twenty-minute bash on a Premiere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money coming for those , then ? " Jean shouted when they got back . Ike was all sweetness . He squeezed his wife and kissed her angry got back . mouth . " Music before butter , " he said . " Remember that , lovely boys . Music before butter , " Stan and Nina had something to sic before about it , too . They made Andy take his guitar back . Stan went with him . Stan and Andy stood in the kitchen , with their shoes on this time . " Why ca n't I buy the lads an instrument apiece ? " Ike said . " Why ca n't I ? " " It 's too generous , " Stan said . " Rubbish . How 's that anybody 's concern but mine ? " " It 's my swiping-well concern , too , " said lean . " Where 's the money coming from ? " The lads watched all this intently . " Boys , sod off into the other room , will you ? " Stan said . Bryn and Andy filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necks , and closed the door behind them . " Look , Ike , you ca n't make up for things by throwing money at them . " " What 's that ? You 've lost me . " " The guitars . You ca n't make other things right . " Ike suddenly understood Stan 's point . His face clouded . " I see . I see what this is about , and I do n't like it . Tell me , how does one thing touch the other ? " " I 'm just saying . " " How the bloody hell does one thing touch the other ? If I want to buy the boys instruments apiece , I buy the bloody instruments apiece ! Christ , man ! " Stan was man enough to sense he might have made a mistake . " I do n't know , Ike , it 's too much . " But Ike had soured now . He called the boys back , and while he waited for them , he said , " Your lad can carry his guitar home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and split it into matchwood , now ! " " He will , as well , " Jean put in . Stan sighed . " Come on , " he said to the bewildered Andy . " Bring your guitar . " Ike followed them out . The dog growled from its kennel but Ike silenced it with a thunderous look . " One thing does not touch another , " he said , almost in a whisper . " You should know that , Stan . One thing does not touch another . " " Happen . " They 'd not gone twelve yards before Ike softly called to Andy . " Practice every day , mind , " he said softly , and with a terrifying squint to his eye . " Practice every day . " " I will , " said Andy . ON THE TOP of the Edge Bryn fumbled with the rope , securing a Pig 's Ear knot as he looped it round a spindly clump of rooted hawthorn . Andy was supposed then to loop the rope around his own waist while Bryn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cave that way - a mere matter of nine or ten feet below the lip of the Edge . Bryn duly disappeared over the lip , negotiating toeholds and finger  --  grips , grunting occasionally and chattering happily . Andy meanwhile stood with his hands in his pockets , anxiously gazing across at the twin wheels of the pit-head winding gear , wondering how the rescue was proceeding . It was possible to superimpose on the landscape the giant ghost of an old lady crouched at those black wheels , spinning away with some dark and concealed purpose . And it was while Andy gazed across the fields to the distant mineworks that he heard a yelp and felt the rope tighten round his waist . Andy grabbed the branch of a nearby tree . The rope jagged against the feeble hawthorn , lifting it out by its roots . Bryn yelped again as the rope dropped him another six feet . Then the hawthorn root popped out of the sandy soil , like a pulled tooth . The rope whiplashed at Andy , turning him in a complete circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashed at Andy 's face as it went past him . It snagged on two fingers of exposed tree  --  root , and Bryn was dumped another six feet . Then the bush tore free and whistled as it went over the Edge . Andy did n't stop to look over . Instead he hurried down past the Witch 's Face and round to the slope in front of the cave , where Bryn lay in a crumpled heap . Blood bubbled at the corner of his mouth . " Yawlright ? " Andy said . " Of course I 'm not all right . " " You 're all right . " Bryn groaned . He 'd been badly winded by the fall , and he 'd scraped his hands and his knees . He 'd also bitten his tongue , which accounted for the blood . In the end he 'd fallen no more than about twelve feet , and had bounced down the sandstone slope beneath the cave mouth . He sat up , holding his head . " Hey , " said Andy . " Not crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you hold on to me ? " " You must be joking . You were gone before I knew it . " " Useless . You 're useless . " Bryn was on his feet . " It was your stupid idea . Tying the rope to that bush . Stupid . Where are you going ? " I 'm going home . " " Wait . I 'll come with you.11 " Sod off . " Bryn shrugged off his friend 's advances and limped away . Within a minute he was out of sight . " Was n't my fault , " Andy shouted . He slumped onto the slope beneath the cave , knowing he should have gone home with Bryn . While Andy 's mother was spending every anxious moment waiting at the pit-head for news of the rescue , Bryn 's mother had told him to come for tea . Just as he 'd done the previous night , munching on sardine sandwiches when Ike had turned up . Ike had broken shifts to be part of the rescue team . He 'd stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He drew a chair to the table where the boys sat , and without a word to anyone laid his head down by the plates and the butter , leaking the odor of coal and exhaustion . The boys munched on their sandwiches , looking at him . After a while Jean placed a steaming mug of tea on the table and Ike lifted his head . He blinked sleepily at the boys . " Well , " Jean had said . " Not much , " Ike said . He slurped his tea noisily . Then he turned to Andy . " Thing is , lovely boy , he 's in a corner with the other blokes and the ceiling is pressed down on " em , see . And we ca n't get . " A flat , opened sardine can lay on the table , next to the butter . He picked up the can . " See how you get this bit of fish stuck in the corner and you ca n't get your knife into it ? Well , that bit of sardine 's your dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tin is the roof come down on him . Now if we pull out what 's holding up the roof , see ? " He pressed down a huge , coal-ingrained thumb , crumpling the flimsy metal sheet of the sardine can . Tomato sauce and fish oil bubbled around the scythed edges of the can . " Well . There you are . " Ike carefully replaced the sardine can next to the butter . " Do n't you worry , lovely boy . Ike will get him out . " Then he put his head back on the table and closed his eyes . Jean had made a silent gesture that they should leave the table . Recalling all of this , Andy felt a sob break free deep in his chest and force its way into his throat . He wiped his eyes and tossed another pebble down the sandstone slope . There was nothing he could do . They would n't let him wait up at the pit-head and there was no one at home . Then the ground shook . Very slightly . The mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he heard a muffled thump . Just for a second he 'd felt the shock of earth dislodging , and he knew he had n't imagined it because a couple of tiny pebbles broke loose from the cave and went bouncing down the slope . He wondered if it had anything to do with the pit rescue . He decided to hurry home . He got up and picked his way down the slope , barely keeping his footing . He knew that if he went back up to the Edge he could cut across fields and get home faster . His hands trembled . He was clambering between boulders , over the exposed roots of trees , when he stumbled . That 's when he saw the second cave . NSIDE THE CAVE , the dog-like growl subsided . Then it came again , only this time it sounded like a man trying to clear his throat of coal-dust . The two tiny lights continued to swing from side to side . Another distressed throaty growl made Andy want to get out . But as the lights floated toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miner 's helmet . The upper light was a helmet lamp . A miner , face blackened with coal-dust , approached him from the dark end of the cave . Hanging from the miner 's belt was a Davey lamp , with its tiny flame alive . The miner stopped , and leaned against the wall . Breathing heavily , he tried to clear his throat again . He was struggling . " Hello Andy . Where 's my lovely boy , then ? " Ike blinked at him in the darkness , his face caked with sweat and black dust . All Andy could see of his features were his teeth and the whites of his eyes . Ike had a rope looped over his shoulder ; identical to the one he and Bryn had played with earlier . " Bryn went home . " Ike seemed confused . He closed his eyes and leaned his head against the cave wall . Ike was breathing asthmatically . He seemed to have trouble getting his words out . " Oh . Came to have a word with him , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear industrious activity taking place deeper in the cave behind Ike . He tried to look beyond the miner . " Where 's my Dad ? " " Your old man 's all right . I got him out . " Ike unhooked the rope from his shoulder and flung it to the cave entrance . " Told you I would . " Andy tried to push past Ike , to get to his Dad . " Let me through . " Ike stopped him . Struggling to draw himself up to his full height , he placed a big blackened paw on Andy 's shoulder . " No , no , no . That 's not for you back there . Nothing to concern you back there . I just came to see my lovely boy . But you say he 's not here , then ? " " No . He went home . " Ike slowly lifted a sooty hand to wipe back the sweat from his brow . Even in the darkness Andy could see it bubbling black and coursing dust into Ike 's eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now you run along home , son . Go and see your old man . " Andy nodded as the miner turned and retreated , with slow heavy steps , the lamp swinging at his side , deeper into the blackness of the cave . " And tell your old man , " Ike called softly . " Tell him what ? " " Just tell him . " Andy escaped from the cave into the bright summer light . There , lying on the floor was the rope Ike had flung at the cave entrance . Andy picked it up . It was black from the coal , and the gritty dust immediately transferred itself to the boy 's hands . He was already blackened from the paw print Ike had left on his shirt , so he hooked the rope over his shoulder and hastened home . When Andy persuaded the gatekeeper to let him through to the pithead , he found his mother there , and his father . Stan had already been brought up with the other rescued men . They were all in good shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the rescue team had been killed in the effort of getting the men out . Andy did n't see Bryn for some weeks afterward . His mother had taken him , along with his sister , to stay with her family in Wales . When Bryn did return Andy tried to pass on the message Ike had given him . " What ? " " He came looking for you . Up at the rocks . Your old man . " " What ? chi " He left the rope . Do you want it ? The rope ? " Bryn wrinkled his nose in contempt . " No . " " But you must . " " Shut it , will you ? Shut it . " Eventually , Bryn and his mother and sister moved permanently to Wales . Andy never said anything about it to his own father . One afternoon he said to Stan , " So Bryn 's dad saved your life then , did n't help " That 's what they say , so$ . That 's what they say , sue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest they ever got to discussing the matter . More than once Andy went back up to Corley Rocks to try to find the second cave . He looked hard for it . He never did find it . Though he did have the rope . He hung it on a nail in the garden shed , where it remained untouched for many years , black with coal-dust . <p>
