Chapter One The paneled door closed quietly behind Jedediah Blackstone , shutting out the noise of the lobby just down the hall . Jed had asked for a room on the third floor , but the hotel had already been full when he 'd checked in three days earlier . Something to do with politics , this being the state capitol , the clerk had said . Crossing to the window that looked out on one of Raleigh 's busier streets , he cast his mind back over the past few hours . Had he left any loose ends untied ? The property had been identified on a large plat on the wall of the land office . The deed had been signed both by him and by the agent representing the railway company , the signatures duly witnessed . The money had been disbursed as he 'd requested , the largest portion going directly into his new account at the bank in Asheville , with only enough held out to cover his traveling expenses , which would be minimal , considering the way he intended to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For another few days - a week , at best - he could consider himself a rich man . Hardly in the same category as a man like Sam Stanfield , the man who 'd had him beaten , branded and run out of Foggy Valley eight years ago for daring to court his daughter - but wealthy enough to keep the bastard from foreclosing on George 's farm . Looking back through the years , Jed had to admit he 'd done a damn sight more than court the girl . Not that that had kept Vera from marrying the same sunovabitch who had branded his ass all those years ago . " Ancient history , " he told the pigeon pacing his windowsill . He had too many more important matters to deal with now to waste time crying over spilt milk that had long since soured . Up until George had wired him about the loan Stanfield was about to call , Jed had been in no hurry to sell the property he 'd won in a poker game . Had n't even known exactly where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmland , therefore good only for what the past owner had used it for - to try and parlay it into something of value . But before he could find another big stakes game , he 'd heard about the railroad 's plans to move farther west , and the same week he 'd had a wire from his half brother , George Dulah , describing the mess he was in . Jed had been in Winston at the time on a meandering trip that would have eventually fetched him up right on the edge of the continent . He 'd had a hankering to see the ocean , now that he 'd read about it in the encyclopedias . The Atlantic , at least . He had a ways to go before he got to the Ps . Instead , he 'd headed for Raleigh , where the railroad land office was located . He had taken a room , had himself a bath , dressed the part of a gentleman and set forth to convert the deed he 'd won into enough cash money to haul George 's ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later that he might have done even better if he 'd held out longer , but time was too short . So he 'd named a price that was enough to cover the amount of his half brother 's loan with any interest Stanfield might tack on , then added enough to cover his own traveling expenses . When George had first written to him about the drought that had nearly wiped him out , Jed had offered to go back to Foggy Valley and help out on the farm . He 'd been flat broke at the time , but he figured another strong back and a pair of willing hands would n't come amiss . George had assured him he did n't need help , and that he 'd be able to pay off the loan once he got to market with his beef and tobacco . So Jed had moved on , heading gradually eastward , and continued doing the things he 'd enjoyed most : gambling , womanizing and reading encyclopedias . He 'd always liked women , ever since he 'd discovered them . For reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too - a big , rough , uneducated guy who was better known for his skill at cards than any skill on a dance floor . Before he 'd heard from George , he 'd been enjoying life , taking it as it came , getting ready to move on to fresh hunting grounds . His half brother had sold his cattle to a drover and come out slightly ahead , but three weeks before the tobacco market opened , his tobacco barn had burned to the ground with the year 's crop of burley inside , forcing him to borrow money from the only man in Foggy Valley in a position to help him . Sam Stanfield . Moneylender , rancher , politician - the man who now owned all the land between Dark Ridge and Notch Ridge . In other words , the entire valley except for the farm that had been in the Dulah family for three generations . According to George , Stanfield was ready to take possession of the Dulah farm , too , unless George could come up with the money to repay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pirate charged . " Not this time , " Jed muttered , dragging his saddlebags out from under the bed . He took off the coat he 'd bought especially for the closing in an attempt to look more like a gentleman than a rambling , gambling half-breed bastard with a brand on his behind . Dressed in Levi 's , his old buckskin jacket and his favorite boots , Jed crammed everything else into his saddlebags . As he 'd already settled up with the slick-haired kid at the front desk , all that was left was to retrieve his horse from the livery and he 'd be on his way . He would have headed directly for the train station but for one thing . Sam Stanfield 's name was not entirely unknown even as far east as Raleigh . Even in the state capitol , Stanfield had friends that kept him informed and Jed wanted his visit to be a surprise . Stanfield had to have known in advance that the railroad was getting ready to make another move , which was why he 'd set out several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foggy Valley as he could by driving honest farmers off their land . George had held out for as long as possible , but when he 'd gone hat-in-hand to the bank in Asheville and been turned away , he 'd had no recourse but to turn to the man he knew damned well would pull the rug out from under his feet at the first opportunity . The Dulahs might have settled the valley a hundred years before the Stanfields had come carpet-bagging down to the Carolinas , but tradition meant nothing to a man like Sam Stanfield . Looking back , Jed could see the pattern all too clearly . Like looking at a hand of cards and foreseeing the way it would play out , he 'd taken the news about the railroad 's westward push through the mountains and added to that the way Stanfield had started finding ways to lay claim to the entire valley . So far the rails did n't go anywhere near Foggy Valley , but Jed was n't going to take a chance that he 'd be spotted and word would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By now he probably knew about the account Jed had opened in the Asheville bank , knew to the penny how much was in it . The fact that Jed 's last name was Blackstone , not Dulah like his half brother 's , might buy him some time , but not much . Jed had a mind to travel the back roads . After eight years of wandering , seeking out card games to support himself , professional ladies for entertainment and public libraries where he could further his education , he was well acquainted with the back roads . In the central part of the state the old wagon trails were slowly being replaced by more modern road , but not back in the hills . There were places there where a man could drop out of sight and not be found for a hundred years . ( Continues ... )
