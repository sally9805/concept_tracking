LONDON-born Frank Baker(19081982) wrote The Birds , an unjustly neglected " Ohmigod , we 're living between two World Wars ! " fable , published a few years after Brave New World and The Shape of Things to Come . It shares little more than a basic premise with Daphne du Maurier 's same-titled 1952 short story , or the 1963 Hitchcock film adaptation . <p> Anna , the heroine , is told about the Days Before the Birds Came Fifty Years Ago by her dying father , who had watched the first mass bird attack on human beings in Trafalgar Square , London , where the avian menace usually comes from panhandling pigeons . He recalls feeling " a dread sense of the mock-world we had set up in place of the real world which was our heritage . " <p> Baker shows how the birds , red in beak and claw , rectify what W. S. Gilbert called Nature 's sole mistake - Man . But do n't expect too much blood and guts . The Birds is an angst-ridden , episodic , idea-as-hero novel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He had some thirty-years-after thoughts , which might have been written this very afternoon : " The world of 1935 differs little from ours of today , except that now there are many more people and the rat-race is swifter . But the birds are too swift . If they came today they would , I hope , be even more alert to the horrors which devil our present society . " <p> But The Birds is n't all neurasthenic plume and doom . Spot the dictator : " ... a small bird flew over his head , casting his load with a gentle plop onto the carefully brushed black hair . " <p> Graham Andrews <p>
