The DC-4 had been flying in total blackness for hours . American Colonel Michael Stone was in the copilot 's seat . Square jaw tense , head aching , the forty-five-year-old Stone did his best not to sound nervous . He asked , " So how do you know where we are ? " With a grin that could be seen by the orange glow of the instrument panel , pilot David Meyer replied , " Does n't really matter . We 've been over water almost the whole time since picking you up on Corsica . One hunk of the Mediterranean is as wet as another . " Michael Stone was returning to Israel as military advisor to David Ben-Gurion . He had been a U.S. Army officer in the Second World War , in the ground war . He knew flyboys were easygoing in the discipline department , but this was over the top . " Then how do you know when we 're there ? " he demanded . " Easy , " Meyer said , gesturing toward the side window with a nod of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should take . When I see the lighthouse in Haifa , we 're there . " " And if you miss it ? " " Then we 're delivering this plane and its cargo to King Abdullah in Jordan . Relax , Colonel . We 've hit every checkpoint over Italy , Crete , and Cyprus ... the last two while you were sleeping . " David checked his bulky metal wristwatch . " Eleven hours now . Another half hour or less to go . " The cargo was a disassembled Messerschmitt fighter plane . Nucleus of the Israeli air force , the German aircraft was hitching a ride to its new home ... Israel ! Wings , fuselage , and prop nearly filledthe back of the transport . Ammunition and spare parts were crammed into the remaining space , except for the crevices occupied by two Czech mechanics and David 's copilot , Bobby Milkin . The three men in the cargo bay were fast asleep . Milkin , an unlit cigar clamped between his teeth , was curled around a Thompson machine gun . The flight continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I heard you and Milkin were bringing in Messerschmitts directly . In one piece , I mean . Flying . So how come you 're driving the bus ? " " You 're right , " David agreed . " We tried . The Messer is only good for an hour or two in the air before refueling . We got as far as Athens . Had a little run-in . To make a long story short , sabotage took out the first two 109s when me and Bobby tried to short-hop ' em into the country . We were lucky . You know ? Anyway , we hitched a ride back to Czechoslovakia to pick this baby up . " " In pieces . How many days to reassemble ? " " Too many . " " And what happens after we arrive ? I mean , what do you do then ? " " Me ? I 've got a wife and a bath waiting for me in Tel Aviv . " Sniffing the air David corrected , " Probably in the other order . Got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the hop back to Zebra ... that 's Czechoslovakia ... for another plane . " David 's voice took on a hopeful note when he said , " If they get the first 109 put together while I 'm gone I 'm gon na trade in this bucket for a fighter . " In a harder tone he added , " The Egyptians have got British Spitfires . Ellie ... that 's my wife ... wrote the story for The Times . About the Egyptian Spits that beat up our people on the docks in Tel Aviv . Anyway , I 'd like to meet those guys one on one . " * * * At twenty-nine minutes into David Meyer 's half hour he blithely announced , " There it is . " Swinging the transport plane in a wide turn , he dropped the port wing so Stone could see the beacon of Haifa Harbor . The rest of the port city and the countryside around was blacked out . " Glad to see the Boss does n't believe in giving the Egyptians an easy target , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Eighty miles to go . Better roust Bobby ... if he is n't too drunk . " Bobby Milkin had not had anything to drink , but he was grumpy at being awakened . " Ca n't you do this without my help , Tin Man ? " he groused . " Just ' cause we 're comin ' into an unknown field , over hostile territory , in the middle of the night . Sheesh , what a amatoor . " Stone did not stay in the cargo bay but instead took the unoccupied navigator 's jumpseat . David hooked his thumb over his shoulder at the colonel . " Just making it look regulation for the brass . " A few minutes later the outline of Tel Aviv and neighboring Jaffa Harbor appeared in the moonlight . " That 's it , " Milkin crooned . " Come to Papa , baby . " " What say we let ' em know we made it ? " David suggested . He dialed up the frequency monitored by the Jewish Agency and keyed the microphone . " Morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing home the goodies . " After the Agency acknowledged , Milkin said , " Man , that sounds good . I hated havin ' to be Panama Airways to fool the limeys . " They were over the middle of Tel Aviv and making the turn toward the southeast approach to the airstrip when the gunfire started . First one line of tracers floated up toward them , then a second , and a third . " Hey ! " Milkin yelled at the ground . " We told you it was us ! " " Somebody forgot to tell our gunners that we have planes too , " David said . " They think we 're Egyptians . " He jinked the craft left . Sideslipping to lose altitude before the lines of fire intersected the path of the plane , he added , " Either that , or the Boss is mad we 're late , eh , Milkin ? " An even colder reception awaited them . With the Arab capture of Lydda Airfield , Israeli operations were shifted to a strip carved out of the Judean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma , the destination had a control tower and barrels of flaming kerosene for runway lights . " Fog , " David said tersely . " Clear weather for a couple thousand miles and now this . Tell the passengers to buckle up , Colonel , then you do the same . " Raising the airfield tower , Bobby Milkin reported their arrival . " Ceiling zero , visibility zero , " the tower responded , then suggested they circle out to sea until a break in the mist presented itself . Studying the fuel gauges , David nodded grimly and headed the plane back toward the west . There were no longer quips in the cockpit , no horseplay . Colonel Stone needed no explanation as to the change in mood . They completed two circles without any improvement in the visibility . On the third pass Milkin said , " Got it ! " He pointed right of the center line where a break in the fog showed a double row of flaming markers . " Call out the altitude for me , Bobby , " David said tersely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Set the flaps . " " One thousand , " Milkin said . His cigar hung like an appendage from his lip . " Nine hundred . Eight . Seven-fifty . " At seven hundred feet the fog swirled in around them . " Six-fifty . Six . " It was so thick David could no longer see the blinking wingtip lights . At Milkin 's call of " Four hundred , " David shook his head and said , " We 're pulling up . " Tugging on the yoke , he urged the transport skyward and once again circled toward the sea . " How much fuel we got ? " Quietly Milkin said , " Enough for one more pass . Want to ditch ? " " How about you , Colonel ? " David asked . " Think the Boss 'd be sore if I messed up his transport and another of his fighters ? " " I never learned to swim , " Stone replied . " Good enough , " David said . " Let 's try again . " Moments later they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David could tell . Once again Milkin reeled off the declining altitude figures . " Six hundred . Five . Four-fifty . I see the runway . Right . Little more right . Three . Two- fifty . " Suddenly out of the eddying vapor loomed a hill , dead in front of them and scarcely fifty feet below . Despite Milkin 's cry of " Pull up ! " David resisted the impulse . If they did so now , they would have to ditch in the sea ... if they could even make it back that far . Instead he jerked the plane hard to the right . He was trusting that the slope fell off more sharply on the side nearest the runway . The ground raced past , looking close enough to touch . The nearness of the hill threw the roar of their engines back at them . Without lift and at reduced airspeed , the transport was sluggish in David 's hands . It resisted him when he tried to correct its position . They were slipping sideways toward the ground . " Gun it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slant above the first two barrels on the left side of the airstrip . A guard flung himself to the ground . David fought to realign the plane with the runway . " Cut ' em ! " David bellowed . The DC-4 bounced , vaulted back toward the sky , then bounced again . David and Bobby Milkin wrestled with the control yokes . At last the transport settled . It rolled out sweetly and was braked to a stop , dead even with the last pair of marker barrels . Turning to Stone , David wiped his brow and said , " Do n't get the wrong idea , Colonel . We always do it like this . " * * * At twenty minutes after two o'clock on the morning of May 19 , 1948 , salvation came to the besieged Jewish Quarter of Old City Jerusalem . The last blazing green line of a flare split the sky in an arch over the city , then died away . The image of it lingered in Haganah Commander Moshe Sachar 's vision . He and his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palmach troops . Carrying medical supplies and ammunition , the Jewish soldiers had broken into the Old City through Zion Gate from Mount Zion . Behind Moshe , Jewish civilians , trapped for months in the Jewish Quarter , swarmed out of their shelters in the cellars of Nissan Bek , the Hurva , and Porat Yoseph Synagogues . Fifteen hundred men , women , children , rabbis , Yeshiva students , and exhausted Haganah defenders packed the narrow lanes to cheer the arrival of fresh reinforcements . The shouts of jubilation were heard by the retreating Irregular troops of the Mufti as they withdrew from their positions . Laughing for the first time in weeks , Moshe kissed Rachel . " It sounds like we are cheering a football match ! " He could not hear Rachel 's reply over the tumult . She squeezed his hand and mouthed the words " I love you " and " hospital . " No further explanation was needed . She took a supply-laden soldier by the arm and led the way to Misgav Ladakh , the dilapidated hospital the Rothschilds built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moshe had taken to calling the place simply " Downtrodden . " These days of war had crowded the musty , vaulted rooms with wounded , all of whom urgently needed the medicine in the packs of the Palmach soldiers . One could find the place in the dark , Moshe thought , by following the stench . A stack of shrouded dead lay awaiting burial in a shed behind the building . The facility had one doctor and two trained nurses . It was staffed and run almost entirely by volunteers . Moshe spotted Rachel 's brother , ten-year-old Yacov , perched on the shoulders of one very large Palmachnik . Yacov was singing " Hatikva , " The Hope , and waving a homemade Israeli flag as his bony dog barked at the soldier 's heels . " We are saved ! " " Blessed be the Eternal ! " It was plain that the Jewish inhabitants of the Old City believed their war was over . Their joy made Moshe uneasy . " It is a miracle ! A miracle ! " " Praise be to Him who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " ... to see this day of our salvation ! " Kisses mingled with tears of rejoicing . The Palmach reinforcements were swallowed up by the crowd of well-wishers . Moshe knew the battle was far from won . Jacob Kalner , the stocky , sunburned corporal who had first breached the wall and opened Zion Gate , stood at the edge of the crowd beside his wife , Lori . She was crying , her head against his chest . He patted her awkwardly , kissed her forehead , caressed her face in his hands , and then they parted . With one longing look back at him , she ran after Rachel and the Palmachnik . The trio vanished into the blackness of the street . Jacob glanced up and caught Moshe 's eye . He worked his way through a gaggle of schoolchildren to Moshe 's side . He shouted to be heard over the din . " There are a handful of my men holding Zion Gate and the corridor through the Armenian Quarter . " Moshe guided him away from the noise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Zion Gate . We hold the tower of St. Jacques , which overlooks the route through the Armenian Quarter to your position . If you hear gunfire from there , you will know the Irregulars are advancing again . " * * * The voices of celebration surrounded Rachel Sachar and Lori Kalner as they pushed through the human tide that clogged the twisted lanes of the Old City . Nathan Cohen , teenage grandson of the woman who ran the soup kitchen at the Hurva Synagogue , called to Rachel , " Your grandfather , Reb Lebowitz , is looking for you , Rachel ! He said if I saw you .... " His voice was drowned by cheering as a newly arrived Palmachnik was hoisted to the shoulders of the young men . " Where is he ? " Rachel shouted . " Home , " Nathan replied , sweeping by in a current of fifteen young Hasidim . " He said ... " The rest of the communication was lost . Lori took Rachel 's hand . " Go to him , " she instructed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't be long . " The two women parted . Lori headed up the sloping road toward Misgav Ladakh Hospital . Rachel turned toward the bulk of the Hurva . Grandfather lived across the lane from the synagogue in a cramped basement room with Yacov and his shaggy mongrel dog named Shaul . The old man had hardly slept since Rachel arrived in the Jewish Quarter . He spent his days helping Hannah Cohen supervise the feeding of five hundred women and children in the soup kitchen . His nights were passed in study and prayer . Rachel clambered down the steps to his quarters . The door was ajar . Soft light from a single candle illuminated the sparsely furnished room . The rabbi sat at a table where two rows of photographs were fanned out before him like playing cards . He did not look up as she entered but said her name . " Rachel . Praise be to the Eternal . " She closed the door behind her . " The Palmach has opened the corridor . We are free . " At this he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs . " You found Moshe ? " " He is at Zion Gate . The people have packed the streets of the quarter . They hinder the movement of supplies . " Grandfather nodded . " Yacov and the dog have gone . I kept the boy with me all night . But who can hold him back with such good news , nu ? " The aged man 's voice was burdened with weariness . Or was it sadness ? There was something here Rachel could not understand . Why , when the whole Jewish Quarter had turned out to celebrate , did he appear so subdued ? " Are you well , Grandfather ? " She sat down in the chair opposite him . He was gazing at photographs of Rachel 's mother and father . Of her brothers . He raised his eyes to search her face . " You look so very much like her . " " I am glad for it . " Rachel touched his arm . " She would have loved to see this . Would n't she ? " He inhaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have which must be saved . " " Everything ... everyone ... is safe now . " He inclined his head in a posture of doubt , then gathered the photographs and placed them in an envelope . He slid it across the rough tabletop to Rachel . " They are just memories . But one day you will want to show them to your children , nu ? Show them that your mama and papa were real people . More than names . More than numbers among six million . " " You keep them , " she urged . " You can show our children , yes ? " " It is better you take them . I have nothing else of value to leave you . " " Leave me ? Do n't talk like this .... " Raising his hand to halt her objection , the old man rose with difficulty . He opened the door , letting the night into the room . The flame of the candle flickered . The cheering of Jewish voices echoed from Zion Gate . He whispered hoarsely , " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rambling about ? Trying to hide her concern , Rachel turned back his bed . " You should sleep . You have not slept in days . Hannah Cohen says you are wearing yourself out . " He faced her , his eyes burning beneath heavy gray brows . " The Lamedvov . The thirty-six righteous ones . Do you understand what I am saying , Rachel ? " " Papa used to speak of it . A famous legend , " she said cheerfully . " Now sleep . " " No legend . Lamedvov . Thirty-six righteous souls who live upon the earth in each generation . It is the Lamedvov who hold back God 's judgment on the world . " He cast a long look out into the night . " Tonight one of them has come among us . I felt his presence . " " Then the Jews of Jerusalem are safe . True ? " The elderly man did not reply . He sighed . Clearly she did not understand . She had missed his point altogether . Wearily he replied , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moshe will send the people back to the shelters ? " " Yes . " " Good . Morning will come too soon for all of us . The children ... morning . " " You must sleep , Grandfather . " He assented , hobbling to the bed . He lay down with his shoes still on . " I will rest an hour . Morning will come , " he said , closing his eyes and falling into a deep slumber . * * * The seventy-four-year-old Mother Superior of Soeurs Rparatrices Convent sat alone in the lightless bedchamber at the Latin Patriarchate . With Dr. Baruch , Lori Kalner , Rachel Sachar , and the sisters of her order , Mre Suprieure had entered the Old City and taken refuge here in the Christian Quarter . Replete with dignity , imperious and stern in her demeanor , it was rare for her to show emotion . Tonight she wept with joy as the sound of singing drifted from the Jewish Quarter . The Arab boy Daoud had returned with news that Rachel and Lori were alive and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital . The prayers of the sisters on their behalf had been answered . Mother Superior 's doors were open to a pinched balcony overlooking the ancient street . From her chair she had prayed and listened , unmoving , as the battle raged . She had heard the roar of explosions and the rattle of machine-gun fire . The flares had illuminated her room so much that she could read the text of her Bible . Her finger held the page of the prophecy she found in Jeremiah 30 . This is what the Lord , says : " I will restore the fortunes of Jacob 's tents and have compassion on his dwellings ; the city will be rebuilt on her ruins , and the palace will stand in its proper place . From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing . " * * * Something holy and magnificent had happened , and she was witness to it . Wiping her tears she whispered , " You have let me live to see this promise fulfilled , O Lord . Two thousand years have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel reborn and Jerusalem her capital ! Christ has died . Christ is risen . Now Christ will come again . " She held the sacred text to her as she began to bargain with the Lord . " And now , a simple request . I want to be back home in the convent when You return . I have lived and served a lifetime at Soeurs Rparatrices . This You know , Lord . In the place where we prayed daily for the peace of Jerusalem , men have made war . Where we prayed for healing , men have killed one another in our garden . We were driven from our sanctuary so this promise might come true . But enough is enough . Sweet Jesus , Savior , I wish only to go home . Back to Soeurs Rparatrices . " Mother Superior knew the facts . The convent was a tactical prize in the game of Jerusalem tug-of-war . It had traded hands a half-dozen times in the last few days . The most recent communiqu indicated it was occupied by Jewish forces . It flanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulwark of Jewish resistance . The granite mountain of Notre Dame and the smaller hill of Soeurs Rparatrices were the prizes each side wanted . To go home ? To return to the convent ? It was a bleak and unpromising scenario . And yet ... Mother Superior reasoned that she had a direct line to the same God who parted the Red Sea for Moses and who tonight opened Zion Gate to resupply the Jewish Quarter . With those examples fresh in her thoughts , she spoke aloud , " There are more who are with us than those who are against us. "
