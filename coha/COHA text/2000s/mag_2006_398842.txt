Section : WHO 'S NEXT 2007 MOVIES : The king of TV comedy gets animated . Not that there 's anything wrong with that . <p> It 's hard to believe it 's been eight years since " Seinfeld " left prime time , and with it Seinfeld himself  --  star , co-writer and producer of the most successful comedy series ever . Yes , the show will be in reruns for eternity . And yes , Seinfeld pops up on TV now and then  --  notably on David Letterman last month , where he arranged for his friend Michael Richards , a.k.a . Kramer , to apologize for the racist rant he 'd unleashed in an L.A. comedy club . " Obviously , it was hideous and horrible , " says Seinfeld , " but I 'm so proud of how he has stepped up  --  he has been a real man . All you can do in life is try to turn something horrible into something progressive . " <p> But what 's Seinfeld really been up to ? Even the comedian whose show was famously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got a growing family  --  three kids ages 6 and under . He occasionally does live stand-up . But it turns out he 's been quietly busy for the last three years writing , producing and starring in a movie for DreamWorks , a film that 's sure to produce enormous buzz , not least because it 's called " Bee Movie . " You may have seen the recent trailer , a goofy tease with Jerry dressed in an unwieldy yellow bee suit  --  a gag more Lucille Ball than Seinfeldian . So laugh , but do n't be fooled . The movie , actually , is animated and stars Seinfeld 's distinctly New York voice as Barry B. Benson , a bee who leaves the hive and discovers , to his horror , that humans have been stealing their honey . While out in the wide world , Barry falls for Vanessa , a New York City florist ( voiced by Rene Zellweger ) . " Somehow you buy that these two hit it off , " Seinfeld explains . " It 's sweet , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It happened , and I did n't resist . But I just go for funny . " <p> Seinfeld 's having coffee off Broadway in New York  --  not in a greasy spoon like the coffee shop where Jerry , George and Elaine kvetched about the minutiae of their lives , but in a slightly Frenchified place called Le Pain Quotidien . It means " daily bread , " but somehow " quotidian " seems right for Seinfeld , 52 , a guy whose entire career is built on his bemused study of everyday life . He says the idea for " Bee Movie " began with just the title : " I thought B-movie was a good idea for a movie about bees , " he deadpans . When he saw the animation technology at DreamWorks , he was hooked . " I love technology , so  --  comedy , technology , cartoons . " In his New York office , Seinfeld is connected to the studio in California via computer screens where animators display the images they 're working on with him . Everyone 's still tweaking  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seinfeld , an inveterate tweaker , is still rewriting . " I think I 'm bringing a different humorous sensibility to an animated movie , " he says . " There 's a lot of attitude in the jokes , the same way it was on the show . " <p> The real Seinfeld , of course , is not the " Seinfeld " we know  --  especially now that he 's famous and seriously rich . But he knows he 's got to stick to certain basics or he wo n't be Seinfeld at all . After nine years of living in Los Angeles while doing the series , he moved back to New York . " I thought if I just live on the Upper West Side , that 's the best thing I can do to stay sane and stay funny , " he says . " I really feared for my sense of humor if I stayed in L.A. " So he roams his neighborhood and buys bagels at the same place he did when he was a struggling stand-up comic and used to smear one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the discipline he wo n't let go . " I tried laying off the stand-up , and I felt like I lost a primary connection , " says Seinfeld . " I think there 's actually a brain muscle in doing stand-up , and it felt kind of flabby . And when your idea pickup machine lies fallow , it needs to be sharpened up . " Seinfeld still slips into small clubs to try material , and he 's constantly nursing new bits . Reaching into his backpack , he pulls out a little black leather notebook , where he jots down ideas . He opens a page : " Why do n't the walls go to the ground in toilet stalls ? " he asks . " My job is to pick up on that thing that 's just below your conscious level . " <p> And what about that even deeper artesian well of pure inspiration in his personal life ? " There 's no way to even describe the gold mine in the comedic arts that family life is , " says Seinfeld , who married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for so long . If my life was total misery  --  which it 's not , it 's heaven , I love my wife , I 'm having a great time  --  but if it was total misery , it would still be worth it for the jokes . " <p> So he 's a little choosy about how he occupies his time . After every Hollywood offer imaginable , he finally took up " Bee Movie , " though he says with a laugh , " I honestly did n't think it would be this much work . " He starts talking about other funny movies . " ' Borat ' , " he says , " is one of the greatest movie comedies ever made . " Recently he gave some advice to its creator and star , Sacha Baron Cohen , about taking his time to choose his next project . " There 's tremendous pressure when you have a hit like that . I said to him , ' With a guy in the position you 're in , there 's no when , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movie " is almost done and he gears up for what he calls " the Bataan death march " of publicity , what 's he going to do next with his life ? " Oh , God , I have no idea . My life ? Just drink this cup of coffee , that 's as far as I 'm going . " Spoken just like " Seinfeld .
