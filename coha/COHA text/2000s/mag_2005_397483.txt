Taking a Stand on Illegal Immigrants ; Fraternity Fallout <p> In a post-9/11 world , comprehensive immigration reform takes on a greater urgency " Border Wars , " November 28 . Fixing a flawed system requires a concerted effort by federal , state , and local governments ; businesses ; and American citizens . While legal immigration ought to be encouraged , illegal immigration needs to be curtailed at the borders . The Canadian , Mexican , and U.S. governments should cooperate to enforce laws already on the books . Before the government implements an amnesty or guest worker program , borders must be secured and illegal immigration halted . After territorial borders are strengthened , the government can create policies to deal with illegal immigrants already here and to develop a streamlined legal immigration process . CHRISTIAN P. MILORD Fullerton , Calif . <p> <p> Your article described " minutemen " as " The angry denizens of the border who have decided to take matters into their own hands by forming armed teams to watch over the green line , as the border is called . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen and a Minuteman from Utah who will continue to perform the duty the government is failing to do : " . . . protect each state against invasion . . . . " DONALD K. WATSON Kaysville , Utah <p> <p> I am a resident of Pima County , Ariz. , and live on property that falls within the migratory routes used by illegal entrants into this country . I carry a gun while I am out riding my horse . Unfortunately , no one mentions the problems that I 've witnessed personally : the break-ins , thefts , property destruction , or ruined equipment that Arizona ranchers must constantly replace as they attempt to make a legal living . Illegal immigrants make a sport of coming across a porous border again and again . I also take exception to your characterization of the Minutemen as " angry denizens . " They are neither . I have met with them on a number of occasions and have invited them to my home . All I have met are reasonable and loyal Americans . DEBORAH HAAS Tucson , Ariz . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the overall solution to curtail illegal immigration . More diligent enforcement of existing labor law is another . Lax enforcement allows businesses that violate the law to be unfairly subsidized by taxpayers , who ultimately pay for services for illegal workers . Without managing demand , supply will never be dampened . Everyone benefits from immigration to this country when it is done legally . As it stands , however , new illegal immigrants undermine both the rule of law and the wages paid to immigrants here legally . PAUL BURICH Los Gatos , Calif . <p> <p> It may be time to call the Mexican government to account for its failure to provide the kinds of services that could eventually persuade its citizens to remain at home . Improved health services and better public education would lead to the kind of healthy and skilled workforce that would attract foreign and domestic investment and , hence , jobs . An adequate public assistance program is necessary to support families while development is underway . This immigration dilemma must be resolved because we are being invaded . SHIRLEY BESSETTE Catonsville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about the immigrants who live here . My students are primarily Hispanic adults , without a high school diploma . What most people do not understand is that many of our Hispanic citizens who are legal immigrants are trying to improve their lives but must compete for jobs against the illegal immigrants and the employers who hire them . VINCENT LACEY Yuma , Ariz . <p> <p> As a San Diego native , I can attest to the fact that the county was overrun with illegal immigrants until Operation Gatekeeper , " a massive border security effort , " gave us a measure of protection . It also wiped out an increasing criminal enterprise in San Diego County : border bandits . The local news used to commonly cover illegals and border bandits shot by law enforcement officers . Now the stories are almost nonexistent . MICHAEL KINCHELOE Porterville , Calif . <p> <p> The way to get rid of the millions of illegal aliens in our country is to have a secure national identification card . If that card were required to work , receive government services , conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , illegal aliens would not be able to function in our country . A secure national ID card would also vastly reduce crime and identity theft . THOMAS P. MCKENNA Montpelier , Vt . <p> <p> The fact that Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff was surprised that most Americans would rather talk about illegal immigration than terrorism illustrates clearly that the U.S. political leadership is out of touch with the citizens of this country on this issue . I believe that most Americans realize that this problem is one of the critical issues of the United States in the 21st century that must be dealt with in a serious and comprehensive manner . Controlling the borders is more complicated than simply adding resources . THOMAS M. BARANICK Chandler , Ariz . <p> Fraternity Fallout <p> I disagree with how Colgate University is forcing fraternities and sororities to sell their houses " Say It Ai n't So : Frats Gone Mild , " November 28 . Colleges can regulate student activities without draconian confiscation of Greek real estate . Most national Greek organizations have an effective education program to teach chapter leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all sororities voluntarily ban alcohol from their houses , and an increasing number of fraternities do not allow it . In my opinion , banning alcohol has resulted in improved academic standings , increased recruitment numbers , involved alumni , stabilized insurance costs , and better servicing of the needs of college students . Fraternities develop leadership ability , and their alumni tend to be larger contributors to their alma maters . ROBERT E. MANLEY Chairman , Manley Burke Publisher of Fraternal Law Cincinnati <p> <p> As the alum adviser to a fraternity , I agree that frats have gone mild . My fraternity recolonized after a 10-year forced expulsion from campus only after the university administration reluctantly gave permission to return when the recolonizing students proposed that the new fraternity be alcohol free . Now we have , for the most part , proved to the campus community that a general social fraternity can thrive and not have alcohol at parties . Even though overall fraternity growth has declined on our campus for the past several years , we have found a niche with students who are looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just over a mug of beer . DAN ANTHONY Winston-Salem , N.C. <p> <p> Colgate 's administration and board of trustees are sliding down the slippery slope of nannyism . As a member and officer of my fraternity , I gained great experience in dealing with the real-life problems of running an organization . Destroying the Greek system denies those who are interested an opportunity to grow up . CARTER H. GUSSLER , M.D. Ashland , Ky . <p> <p> Many members of Colgate ' s undergraduate and alumni population who participated and continue to participate in fraternities and sororities agree that the college Greek experience was and continues to be more significant in life outside Colgate than the time spent in the classroom .
