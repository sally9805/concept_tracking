Chapter One One Week Later " Eeeww ! What is she thinking with that hair ? " Maggie looks up from her computer monitor and leans toward her friend Belinda 's computer . " I do n't know ... I think she 's kinda cute , " Maggie protests , gazing at the woman in the photo on the screen . Belinda-dubbed Bindy by her finishing school roommates , a nickname to which she clings as ferociously as her waning youth-announces , with a wrinkle of her cosmetically altered nose , " Her hair is pink . " " She ca n't help what she looks like , Bindy . " " Trust me , there is no pink hair in nature . This is deliberate . " Bindy clicks the mouse , and the picture vanishes . " There . I 'm done . " " You 've been through all the Metro Women Seeking Metro Men listings ? " Maggie asks in disbelief . " Yup . " " Including the boroughs ? " " Brooklyn and Queens . The Bronx is too dangerous- " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - yes , all of it , and Staten Island is too inconvenient . But I went through everything else . " " And you did n't find one potential date for Dom ? " " Nope . " " What about that pediatric musical therapist who directs the church choir in her spare time ? She said her hobbies are tennis and the Yankees and that her favorite food is pizza . She 'd be perfect for Dom . " " She had a huge space between her teeth . " " So does Lauren Hutton . " " She 's Lauren Hutton . She can get away with it . Did n't this chick ever hear of braces ? If you 're going to put yourself out there in a matchmaking service , you do a little basic maintenance first . " Maggie again regrets bringing Bindy along to Matchmocha , Matchmocha-a cozy little exposed brick-and-rafters Bleecker Street cybercafe catering to spouse-shopping , **30;962;TOOLONG singles . She might be one of Maggie 's closest friends , but she 's notoriously picky and judgmental when it comes to- well , okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picky , too-at least , in choosing a potential date for Dom . She 's got to find the kind of woman who would n't mind taking care of a man who ca n't take care of himself . An old-fashioned woman who is n't already married to her career-and who would n't be opposed to rolling up her sleeves and pitching in with Dom 's family restaurant on occasion . That 's an absolute must in the Chickalini family . Even Maggie has boxed her share of fresh-out-of-the-oven pizza pies . So far , she 's only found two women who might fit the bill , and neither struck her as particularly appealing aside from the fact that they stated that they know their way around a kitchen . " Look , Bindy , I 'm going to keep browsing . Why do n't you check out the guy listings ? " Maggie suggests . Bindy 's salon-arched eyebrows disappear beneath a swoop of sprayed dyed-blond hair . " Are you kidding ? Why would I do that ? " Maggie shrugs . " You 're available . Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't date somebody who has to advertise himself , " Bindy says , as though Maggie has suggested that she strip naked and do a pole dance for the two Wall Street types at the next computer terminal . " I mean , this is barely one notch above taking out a personal ad in the Post . " " Get over it , Bindy . Everybody does it these days . " " I do n't . You do n't . " " That 's because I have Jason and you ... " " Have class ? " Bindy gives an airy wave of her shiny plum-colored manicure . " And anyway , you do n't have Jason right now . You might as well be advertising yourself as available , too . " " A long-distance relationship does n't make me ' available , ' " Maggie protests . " It does if he does n't come back . " " He 's coming back . " " Mmm hmm . " Bindy shrugs . " Anyway , you said you were both allowed to see other people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure he 'd have told me if he had , " Maggie says with a confidence she does n't quite feel . Three months into their relationship , Jason Hendrix flew off to South America to provide medical care for poor , underprivileged , native children . Bindy is n't nearly as impressed with Jason 's noble lifesaving mission as she was with his East Thirty-eighth Street town house , his family 's Bedford estate , and his unmarried colleagues . In fact , with her thirtieth birthday looming and nary a potential fianc on the horizon , Bindy accused Maggie of sabotaging both their love lives by telling Jason not to stay in New York on her account . But what else could she do ? He had made arrangements for the mission long before he and Maggie locked eyes across a crowded elevator in Saks that rainy October Saturday . And he did offer to stay . So why did n't she ask him to ? Everything about him is right . He 's exactly what she- and every other woman in Manhattan-has been looking for . Wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adores kids . He 's even Catholic , a quality that 's a prerequisite in all marriage candidates , as far as Maggie 's parents are concerned . Not that they have any say over whom she marries ... but it will make it a heck of a lot easier to get them to pay for the wedding , that 's for sure . How could she let him slip away ? Maybe Bindy is right about her having been a fool to let him go . She was probably a fool to agree to seeing other people , too . He 's probably taken full advantage of that , while she has n't so much as glanced in another man 's direction . Well , Jason will be back next month , and , presumably , they can pick up where they left off . In the meantime , she 's got plenty to keep her busy , what with her job as media planner on a cosmetics account , working out at the health club , hanging out with her friends-oh , and finding Dom a domestic damsel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking her Philippe Charriol watch . " We 've been here forever . " " Just give me another fifteen minutes . I want to answer a few more women for Dom . " " Do n't you think he should be answering them himself ? " " Are you kidding , Bindy ? He 's a great guy , but he 's not exactly the most eloquent person I 've ever met . Besides , I promised him I 'd take care of all the details . " " Is it really fair to these women that you 're pretending to be Dom ? I mean , first you fill out his questionnaire for him , now you 're writing e-mails pretending to be him . " " Of course it 's fair . It 's not like Dom does n't exist . " " Yes , but Eloquent Dom does n't exist . I think you 're cheating . " This , from a woman with an illegal sublet and socks in her bra . Maggie rolls her blue eyes . " You want another coffee ? " Bindy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spade bag . " Sure ... but make it decaf this time , or I 'll be up all night . And make sure it 's skim , okay ? " Maggie watches her friend sashay toward the barrista , then turns back to the computer screen , twirling a length of shoulder-length black hair around her forefinger as she concentrates . Hmm ... Alison Kramer looks interesting , but according to her questionnaire , she 's the single mom of a five-year-old . Baggage . Dominic definitely does n't need baggage . Maggie clicks the mouse on the NEXT button , and finds herself gazing down into a pretty , all-American face . A face , she sees , scanning the accompanying questionnaire , that belongs to a woman named Julie P.-no last names at Matchmocha , Matchmocha . Julie P. is a pastry chef who lives in the Village and , according to her questionnaire , is an old-fashioned girl at heart . She says she 's ready to settle down and start cooking for two . Eating for two , too . Perfect for Dom . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it yet . Maggie 's always been one step ahead of him when it comes to his life . She was the one who suggested that he major in business so that he could take over his father 's pizzeria . When his sister Nina decided to take over the business instead , it was Maggie who suggested that Dom follow her into the advertising industry . She got him the interview at Blair Barnett , the agency where she 's a media planner , and the next thing she knew , he 'd been hired as an assistant account executive . " Sometimes I think you know me better than I know myself , Mags , " Dom likes to say . " You know what I need before I do . " True . She does pride herself on being a take-charge kind of person . Plus , she 's known him for six years now , having met him on her first day of freshman year in college , and if there 's one thing she 's figured out about Dominic Chickalini , it 's that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls in the dorm competing for the chance to help him with his laundry , his English Lit papers , even his Christmas shopping . It 's the same at the office . The other day , Maggie actually caught one of the female account coordinators bringing Dom a cup of coffee . Not even coffee-cart coffee that you get down the hall , but the kind you have to leave the building to get from Au Bon Pain . He 's the eternal motherless little boy , soaking up the nurturing affection of women like a paper towel in a Bounty commercial . He needs to be showered with love , especially now that his sisters are married and caught up in families of their own . He needs a wife . Not so that she can fetch his coffee , but so that she can take care of him . That 's why she needs to be a certain kind of woman . An old-fashioned kind of woman . Like this Julie P. , who comes right out and says she enjoys cooking , cleaning , and sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her . " Thanks , " Maggie murmurs , lost in Julie P. 's questionnaire . Reading over her shoulder , Bindy snorts . " Is this chick for real ? ' I also know how to darn socks and churn butter , and in warmer months I grow fresh vegetables on my fire escape ... ' ? Maggie , this is just- " " I know ! She sounds almost too good to be true , does n't she ? " " What is she , Amish ? " " She 's just old-fashioned . I think she 's perfect for Dom . I 'm going to reply to her . " " Whatever . I still do n't think it 's right . " Her fingers poised over the keyboard , Maggie wonders if maybe it is deceitful , pretending to be Dom , even with his permission . Maybe he should be selecting his own women , writing his own e-mails ... Maggie 's gaze shifts thoughtfully back to the questionnaire . Her intuition is saying that this is the right woman for Dom , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for your own good , she tells the smiling Julie P. Yours , and Dom 's . You 'll both thank me someday ... you can name your first daughter Maggie . Her mind made up , she clicks the mouse on the SEND E-MAIL button and begins typing . " Ooh , look , Charlie , I 've got mail ! " Julie says cheerfully , leaning over his shoulder as her sign-on screen pops up at last . Matchmocha , Matchmocha is busy tonight ; they drank two mochaccinos each waiting for a free computer terminal . " Yup . You 've got a lot of mail , " he replies , after clicking to open the mail icon . His eyes widen at the long list of responses that pop up . " I told you I did a great job on your questionnaire , Jul ' . " " I still do n't think you should 've put in that thing about darning socks . I do n't even know what darning socks means . " " Which means there 's no chance you 'll ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie . " " I guess , but ... what about the part where you wrote that I ca n't wait to start a family and I want at least four children . Do n't you think that 's going to scare off most guys ? " " Not the kind of guys you 're looking for . You want family man types , Julie . And there must be a bunch out there , because look at all these replies . " " Great . Let 's start reading them . " She plops into a chair beside him and leans in , her chin balanced on his shoulder as he clicks on the first e-mail . The faint scent of vanilla sugar wafts beneath his nostrils . " Okay , here we go . ' Dear Julie : My name is Neil and I think you 're totally hot ... ' " " Yuck . Next . " " Do n't you want to hear what else he has to say ? " Charlie asks , scanning the rest of Neil 's e-mail . " Actually , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neil and his lewd plans for Julie into cyberpurgatory . The next response is n't much more promising . Somebody named Theo has never dated a pastry chef before and wants to know how creative she can be with whipped cream and melted chocolate . " I feel like I need to take a shower , " Julie says with a shudder . " Delete him , please . " " Already done . Do n't get discouraged , Julie , you 've got over thirty responses here . " " If they 're all from oversexed losers- " " They wo n't be . " Yes , they will . At least , that 's the way things are shaping up after the first dozen or so responses . Apparently , there 's something about a woman who creates desserts for a living that brings out the kinky underbelly in a small segment of the male population . " I ca n't believe I let you talk me into this , " Julie says , pushing back her chair as Charlie deletes yet another response . " Where are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if Mr. Right is in here somewhere ? " He gestures at the remaining responses on the screen . " I doubt that . " She glances restlessly around the crowded cafe . " I 'm going to wait in line and get another mochaccino and one of those sugar cookies . I bet you anything it tastes like sawdust , but I love the way they piped the icing around the edges of the heart . I want to get a closer look . You want one ? " " Nah , I 'm good . I 'm going to go through the rest of these guys . If anybody looks promising , I 'll holler . " " Yeah , I wo n't hold my breath . " After Julie walks away , he clicks through another couple of losers . One has a foot fetish and wants a close up photo of her toes ; another is in his midfifties and lives with his mother , who , in the space of one short e-mail , is mentioned way too often for comfort . A third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on the side . Charlie is starting to feel like he needs a shower , too . Then he opens the one from Dominic C. Dear Julie : This is crazy , is n't it ? I mean , it would be much easier for an old-fashioned guy like me to meet an old-fashioned girl like you in the old-fashioned way . Welcome to the twenty-first century , huh ? Here we are at Matchmocha , Matchmocha-so here 's the link to my questionnaire so that you can see for yourself that I 'm not some leering two-headed lunatic . Charlie clicks on the link . A photo appears . Nope , not a leering two-headed lunatic at all . In fact , Dominic C. is a good-looking guy . Unaccustomed to giving a fellow male more than a quick glance , Charlie forces himself to analyze the candidate , trying to see him as a woman might ... whatever that means . Dark hair combed straight back from his forehead , good build , and dressed almost the same as Charlie is right now , in jeans and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks natural-a Regular Joe . According to Julie , Frenchy the Ex enjoyed wearing custom-made suits , and wore polished loafers with his jeans . In Charlie 's opinion , there 's just something wrong about that . Dominic 's shirt is dark green , as opposed to the navy one Charlie has on ; and his hair is a few shades darker and not as shaggy as Charlie 's . There 's only one drawback . He looks like the kind of guy who wears cologne , Charlie concludes . He , himself , is not that kind of guy . Continues ...
