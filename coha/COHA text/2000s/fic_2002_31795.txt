I heard the ring through fuzzy sleep . Groaning , I opened one eye and groped for the receiver . " Hello ? " " Hel-lo , Eve Diamond , " said a cheerful voice on other line . " Miller here . " My editor was oblivious to , or else ignoring , my sleep-logged voice at ten in the morning , a time when most reporters were already at their desks , rustling through the daily paper and midway through a second cup of coffee . I swallowed , and tasted chardonnay , now a sour reminder of last night 's excess . " ... slumped in her new Lexus , blood all over the place , right there in the parking lot of Fabric World in San Gabriel , " Miller was saying . " Guess the bridesmaids wo n't be wearing those dresses any time soon . " I cleared my throat . " Can I have that address again , my pen stopped working . " " Why , suuure , " he said . " Hold on , let me see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Matt Miller . He was my hero , known and loved throughout the paper as a decent human being , a trait the Los Angeles Times rarely bred anymore in its editors . Most of the real characters had long ago been pushed out of the profession or early-retired to pickle themselves slowly and decorously in hillside moderne homes . They had been replaced by gray-faced accountants with more hidden vices . Funny thing was , Matt did n't seem to drink too much , and he was happily married . After a quick shower , I was out the door of my apartment . I lived in a funky hillside community ten minutes northwest of downtown . Silverlake 's California bungalows and Spanish-style homes harkened back to an earlier era when the neighborhood had bustled with some of Hollywood 's original movie studios . And though the studios had long ago given way to the same public storage facilities and mini-malls that infested the rest of the city , a whiff of 1920s glamour still clung to our hills and attracted one of the city 's most eclectic populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They settled down , living cheek by pierced jowl alongside multigenerational Latino families , third-generation Asian-Americans , Eastern European refugees from communism , 1930s-era Hollywood communists , and a smattering of liberal white yuppies , all of whom somehow managed to get along . Plus it was freeway close . Within moments I was chugging along the ten-lane expanse of asphalt , looping around downtown Los Angeles and heading east on Interstate 10 . Steering with one hand , I flipped the pages of my Thomas Guide with the other , looking for Valley Boulevard and Del Mar . Out my window , the bony spines of the San Gabriel Mountains were already obscured by a thick haze . The San Gabes were a scrubby desolate range northeast of the city , from which bears and mountain lions emerged with regularity to attack the inhabitants of tract houses gouged from the hills . Each year , flash floods and icy ridges claimed a dozen or so hikers . You would n't think that could happen so close to the city , but it did . The way I saw it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only we who called it accidents . The cars ahead of me shimmered in the heat . The forecast was for 102 degrees in the Inland Valleys , with a Stage 1 Smog Alert . Already , perspiration pooled in the hollows of my body , and I cursed the fact that the A/C was out again in my nine-year-old Acura Integra . Oh , it happened at that place , I thought , as the mammoth shopping center loomed into view . It was an anomaly that only the Pacific Rim fantasy aesthetic of Los Angeles could have produced . Built in a Spanish Mission style , with dusky earth tones , the three-story shopping center catered exclusively to the exploding Chinese immigrant community , although on occasion , a looky-loo gringo would wander through , bug-eyed at the panorama of this Asian Disneyland . At San Gabriel Village Square , a name developers clearly hoped would evoke a more bucolic time , you could gorge on Islamic Chinese food , buy designer suits from Hong Kong , pick out live lobsters for dinner and $700 bottles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million insurance policy on your cheating spouse . Or , as seventeen-year-old Marina Lu had done , you could order custom dresses for the ten bridesmaids who would precede you down the aisle the following June , the wedding day Marina had planned for years with the boy she had known since junior high . Except on this stultifying morning , fate had backed up and pulled a U-turn , and now Marina Lu lay dead , brains splattered all over the buttery leather seats of her status car , the two-carat rock on her manicured engagement finger refracting only shattered hope . I picked my way past the yellow police tape that cordoned off the murder scene , waving my notepad and press pass and standing close enough to a burly cop so that my perfume-spiked perspiration got his attention . " Looks like an attempted carjacking that went bad , " the cop said , squinting into the sun as he recited the facts . " Witness in the parking lot heard the shot , then saw an Asian kid , about fifteen , take off in a late-model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the first time they flubbed it . She must have resisted . " The policeman punctuated his commentary with a huge yawn that bared his fleshy pink palate . " And there 's why , " his partner said , watching the homicide detective retrieve a Chanel bag and pull out a matching wallet stuffed with hundred-dollar bills . " She was gon na pay cash for those dresses . Those immigrants do n't believe in credit . " Nudging the Acura back onto the freeway , I headed for my office in Monrovia , a formerly white WASPy town at the foot of the San Gabriels , where the Times had established a bureau in the halcyon years when it was busy stretching great inky tentacles into every Southland cul-de-sac . The Valley was gritty and industrial , filled with the vitality of colliding immigrant sensibilities that were slowly squeezing out the blue- and white-collar old-timers . All the big Rim cities were morphing into Third World millennial capitals . But in the San Gabriel Valley , the future was already here . I made a mental note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for lunch on the Times Mirror tab . I had seen him again today at the mall carjacking , interviewing madly . Skinny , with bad teeth , he looked like he could use a good meal . And I could use some fresh story ideas . " Metro wants twelve inches , " Miller called out when I stepped inside the fluorescent light of the office , letting the cool air blast my hot skin . I wrote it up , then dawdled at my desk . Until there were some arrests , it would be just another murder in the City of Angels , which on prickly summer days averaged more than one each hour . Sure , there was the sob factor about the bride mowed down as she planned her wedding , and I milked it for all it was worth . But it was more from habit than any vestigial hope that I would shock readers into doing something about it . The story of the dead woman in the car was no more gripping than that of the two-year-old toddler killed by a stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . The elderly widow clubbed to death in Long Beach by the transient she hired to weed her lawn . Or the seventeen-year-old honor student in El Sereno whose single mother had changed neighborhoods to escape the gangs , only to have her son shot when his car broke down on the freeway . For reporters and cops alike , a sort of battle fatigue had set in . We had lost our ability to be shocked . My brain flickered to the next story as I ate cold sesame noodles from the plastic bento box I packed each morning . Then it was back in the sweltering car to interview a man named Mark Furukawa for an education story . In a small bureau , everyone wore several hats . I also covered the schools . Frankly , the education beat did n't thrill me . Single , without kids , I could n't relate to the obsession with SAT scores and dress codes . Now a teacher had referred me to Furukawa , hinting that the youth counselor for troubled kids at the Rainbow Coalition Center could dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decaying mini-mall in El Monte , a small municipality twenty minutes away . A scattering of Asians sat in the waiting room , resignation and boredom etched across their faces . Some filled out forms , while others stared out through the grimy venetian blinds into the parking lot , ignoring the dust that clung to the metal slats and balled in the corners of the room . Soon , I was ushered into a functional cube of an office . A framed photo of an Asian woman stood on the desk . She was clad in a vintage forties cocktail dress , with a string of pearls and a low-cut dcolletage . Her hair was done up in long curly waves and her eyes were big and limpid . Behind the desk were bookshelves crammed with medical journals and psychology texts and a guidebook to Los Angeles County gangs . Wedged in between was a blue-and-white can of something called " Pocari Sweat " whose cursive lettering evoked the Coca-Cola logo . I checked it out for a while , then glanced at my watch , wondering when Furukawa would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was in his early thirties , exuding an attitude that started with his Doc Martens , traveled north up the jeans to a jutting hip , and ended with ponytailed hair tied back in a colorful Guatemalan scrunchy . A little too street for his own good , I thought , and probably a recovered drug addict or gangbanger to boot . " Be with you in a sec , " the man said , and disappeared . I had been expecting a middle-aged guy with a paunch , not some hipster near my own age . Well . I made my way back to the other side of the desk and settled into a plastic chair , feeling the fabric stick to the back of my skirt . Now I took a closer look at the girl on his desk . She smiled into the camera , her eyes shiny with love . It figured he would have a stunning girlfriend . Nobody displayed a picture like that without intending to telegraph something . He came back into the room and we shook hands and traded business cards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing any trends with kids in the San Gabriel Valley . " There are a million good stories out there , but the real interesting ones , I ca n't talk about . " Furukawa lit up a cigarette . In the San Gabriel Valley , everybody still smoked , and no one asked you to put it out . That would have been going against the culture . He bit down on a pen and thought for a moment . " I do see a lot more straight-A kids living a double life in gangs . " " In the Asian community , hhmmm . I would n't have thought . " " Yeah , that 's the problem with us , the model minority myth . " " I did n't mean ... " " You 're not the first . But dig , most of the kids I see are immigrants . Mom and Dad may live here now but their brains are hard-wired to the old country . " Furukawa leaned back in his chair and described kids caught between traditional Asian values and permissive American culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent him all their problem cases and he jive-talked them into listening , which was always the first step , he said . He spoke their language . It did n't matter that he was a Sansei and they were Overseas Chinese and Southeast Asian . " No offense , but I thought the Chinese did n't like the Japanese on account of World War Two . " He appraised me anew . " This is the New World . We all get along . They 'd like Hirohito himself if he paid attention to them . " I scribbled as he spoke , filling page after page in my notebook . He saw I was lagging and stopped , puffing on his cigarette and staring out the window until I caught up . In another , more quiet corner of my mind , I wondered how often he gave this spiel to ignorant whites and how he felt about it . Soon he seemed to grow impatient and ambled over to the bookshelf to pull something down . Now he turned and lobbed it at me . " Catch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found myself holding the blue-and-white can of Pocari Sweat I had been staring at earlier . " Nice reflexes . You 'd be good in a pinch . " He walked back to his chair and sat down , and I wondered what kind of game we were playing . " What the hell is Pocari Sweat ? " I asked . " Do you squirt it under your arms ? " " Japanese sports drink . Think Gatorade . The name is supposed to evoke a thirst-quenching drink for top athletes . " " Who 's going to want to drink something called ' sweat ' ? " " Exactly . " He looked pleased with himself . " No one in America . But it 's only marketed in Asia . Lots of stuff has English names . Asians do n't get the negative cultural connotation of the English words , so you end up with something that does n't quite translate . " " I see . " I was n't sure where this digression was going . " A lot of the immigrant kids I counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't know how to decode . The parents are even worse off . They expect their children to show filial piety , excel in school , and come straight home when classes let out . Meanwhile the kids want to date , hang out at the mall , and yak on the phone . They want all the nice consumer things they see on American TV . So they find ways to get them . The parents only wise up when a police officer lands on their door . " " And they 're not collecting for the police benevolent fund . " " You got it . " Furukawa stubbed out the emphysema stick . " The kids get beaten or grounded for six months . So they run away . To a friend 's house to cool off , if they 're lucky . If not , to a motel room rented by some older pals from school , maybe a dai lo . Where they can drink and party with their girlfriends . And when the money runs out , it 's easy to get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dai what ? " " That 's Chinese for older brother . It 's a gang term . The dai lo recruits younger kids into gangs . Shows them a good time . Takes them out to a karaoke bar when they 're underage and buys ' em drinks . Drives them around in a fast car . The good life . It 's very seductive when you 're fifteen . And these kids feel that once they 've left home and disgraced their parents , they can never go back . " He might have been talking about the weather , or how his car needed gas . To him , this was mundane , everyday stuff . To me it was a glimpse into a suburban badland I had n't considered before . " What do you mean , there 's always work to do ? " " Muscle at the local brothels . Drug runners . Carjackings . You name it , " Furukawa shrugged . " One homie told me he gets a thousand for each Mercedes he delivers . " " Carjackings ? I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messy , " I spoke slowly . " Young bride who 'll never see her honeymoon night . It 'll be on the news tonight . " Furukawa winced . " Can you introduce me to some of these kids ? " I tried to keep the hope out of my voice . " Afraid not , darling . " " Why not ? Now that you 've told me . " I was miffed . " They 're minors . There are all sorts of privacy issues . And these are fucked-up kids . They do n't need any more distraction in their lives . " " Yeah , well . " It was a tantalizing lead , but I needed his help to pursue it . " Wait a minute , " I said , " I thought the Vietnamese were the ones who joined gangs . A society brutalized by war , years in internment camps , families torn apart and killed ... " " Yeah , they sure do . But they ai n't flying solo . You got Cambodians , Filipinos , Samoans , Overseas Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local offshoots of the Hong Kong triads : White Crane , Dragon Claw , Black Hand . They 're equal-opportunity employers , " he grinned . " And unlike your black and Latino gangs , they do n't advertise it with baggy clothing or shaved heads . Your typical Asian gang member dresses preppy . Neat and clean-cut . Sometimes they 're even A-students . Total double life , like I was saying . But sooner or later something cracks . " Yeah , like today in the shopping center , I thought . I looked out the window , where the sky was streaked with red and purple . " This could be a really good story , " I told him . " But I would need to meet some kids , then use their stories to illustrate the larger trend . " His eyes swiveled from me to the manila files piled atop his desk , then back to me . He put his hand on the top file , then shook his head . " I just finished telling you that these are screwed-up kids . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give a rat 's ass about the slash marks on their wrists or the gang rape they suffered at age thirteen . You just want the lurid details . Then after you 've gotten them all heated up reliving it , you 'll toss the mess back into my lap and expect me to fix it . " " That 's why you 're a totally simpatico counselor and I 'm a heartless reporter . " I tossed back the can of Pocari Sweat . With an almost imperceptible flick of the wrist , he extended one hand and caught it . " Of course we 'd change their names . We 're not intrusive like TV . Think how a Times story would get people talking . The Board of Supes might even cough up extra funding . " I leaned forward and locked eyes with him . " I can see you 're protective about your kids , Mark . They 're lucky to have you on their side . But for the record , we 're not all automatons . " I stood up . He stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Drink ? " he said finally . " I know a great Italian place . " " Italian ? " I said in mock-horror . " The least you could do after insulting me is offer to take me to a sushi bar you know tucked away in one of these awful strip malls . " " Not too many of those left on this side of town , " he sighed . " They 've all moved west and gone uptown . Besides , what you got against Italian ? " " Nothing . I just have this thing for sake . " He considered this . Suddenly nervous , I rushed in to break the silence . " Maybe some other time . You probably have to meet your girlfriend . " " My girlfriend ? " " I pointed to the photo on his desk . " I could n't help noticing . She looks just like Gong Li . " He laughed . " My mother , who is Japanese , by the way , not Chinese , will be flattered . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show relief . " Yes . Right after she got married . My father took the photo . " " Sorry , " I stuttered . " I just assumed that since it was on your desk ... " He was staring at me again . I knew I was turning crimson . I had n't meant to get all personal . Now he would think I was nosy as well as a heartless exploiter of damaged kids . " Do n't be , " he said . " It 's there for a reason . There 's a lot of transference in my line of work . Some of these teenage girls , they 're really searching for their lost daddies but they 'll settle for me . So I put Mom here to keep an eye on things . I 've found she wards off the weirder stuff . " Now I was doubly intrigued . And oddly ecstatic that he did n't have a girlfriend . At least not one whose picture he put on his desk . He was all business as he showed me the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
