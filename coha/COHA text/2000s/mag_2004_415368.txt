" Well , here they are , seven stories about average Joes , guys who work a full week ( sometimes at two jobs ) but live for chasing whitetails . They 're spread out around the country , some in legendary deer counties and others near up-and-coming hot spots . None would describe themselves as trophy hunters ; they 're just hard-core , honest outdoorsmen . What they all have in common is that each has a great story to tell and each shot a deer that would make a grown man squeal with glee . To the yin of ethical , honest hunting , however , there 's a yang . In this year 's deer hunting yearbook we made sure to include the darker side of the sport . Tales of strange poaching busts are , sadly , almost as widespread as stories about superbucks . On the lighter side , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like trivia and stats . Read the adventures , get excited and hunt hard this season . Accounts of monster bucks , which were once told only by a handful of elite hunters , are becoming more and more common . Maybe next year we 'll feature yours . Chad Hane Chad Hane of Stillwater , Okla. , and his brother were eating lunch when the doorbell rang . They were n't expecting company . When Hane opened the door he was surprised to see two state policemen . " Is there a problem , officer ? " he asked . " No , " said one . " But we heard you shot a nice buck . We hoped to take a look . " Just a few hours before , on the opening morning of Oklahoma 's archery season , October 1 , Hane had arrowed a monster non-typical . The buck measured 214 4/8 . Hane was confused , though , as to how the police already knew about his kill . He had told only two people , and one was his brother , who was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had shot a trophy . I guess she told a coworker , " Hane says . From there the rumor mill exploded . Hane maintained food plots on the 10 acres of land where he was born and raised ; he had a good idea about the size of the local bucks . Still , on August 10 he was surprised to look out his bay window and see four deer eating from a new feeder in his backyard . One of them was the huge non-typical . " My wife grabbed the video camera and we taped the deer until dark , " he says . The buck 's peers were worthy trophies as welltwo 8-pointers and a non-typical 12-pointer . A firefighter by trade , Hane is maniacal about safety . That means still-hunting only , no tree stands . Normally that would n't be a problem , but prior to the hunt he underwent shoulder surgery . His arm was weak , and he could only pull a 48-pound draw weight . Hane awoke much earlier than needed on opening day . Unlike most hunters who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards across the rear of his property to an elevated cedar grove . His only worry was the weather . It was cool and overcast and the wind was n't right , but if the deer came in slowly he could get a shot before they caught his scent . The deer marched in single file . He set his sights on the first one , that massive non-typical he 'd watched many times . Trying to suppress his nerves , he fired a " decent shot " from 45 yards that hit the deer broadside but did n't pass through . When he found the deer , Hane decided to try his hand at scoring . His first score put the buck near 180 . He missed a few non-typical points , however , which added an additional 30 points to his score . " What I could n't get over was the age of the deer . The biologist is certain that this buck was n't a day over three and a half . " By that afternoon his life was like a carnival attraction . Hane took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flatbed of his pickup . A couple of tines stuck out from behind the tailgate . He told the wildlife officer that he had a trophy . Skeptical as most hunters are , a couple of men standing nearby heckled him . " That does n't look very big , " one said . Hane told them to take a closer look . When they caught a full glimpse of this non-typical , there was no more doubting . The tremendous deer stands as the new Oklahoma archery record . Ricky Roy The first deer Ricky Roy shot , he carried 300 yards to his truck without stopping to rest . The deer was a spike , but it hooked him to the sport . " My daddy did n't hunt deer , only rabbits and birds , " says Roy , of Russell Springs , Ky . " I started hunting by going with some older friends to lottery hunts at Fort Knox . In those days there were n't many deer around . " That was 20 years ago , when Roy was a teen . Times changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soybeans , corn and alfalfa . Good deer habitat suddenly became greatwitness the 40 Boone and Crockett Club entries during the 2003 season . This change became evident to Roy as he stood over a massive buck he shot on November 8 . He knew he would n't be carrying this one out of the woods alone . Four days prior to the hunt , Roy and his son were coon hunting late at night when they spooked a huge deer , a legendary animal among Roy 's friends . " We 'd watched him in the summer for three years , " Roy says . Roy even had the sheds from the year before , so he knew what class buck he was chasing . Russell County is not a hotbed of monster deerthey had never even had a B &C; buck taken there . That made this buck even more enticing . Five hunting buddies turned a one-and-a-half mile section of land upside down looking for the deer . They had him patterned in September , but during the rut he moved . " When the soybeans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Roy remembers . Luckily a few coon hounds chased the wrong scent and jumped the buck , giving Roy a chance to take this elusive deer . The terrain in Russell County is roughcrags and creek bottoms give way to dense woods dotted with small agricultural fields . Roy set his son up on the property , a friend 's farm , in an area rife with sign . He moved a half mile away and placed his stand deeper in the woods along a hillside . Shortly after 7 a.m. , a doe moved toward him but stopped to check the wind . To his left he watched a huge set of antlers emerge from the ivy . The rack attached to this buck matched his sheds almost perfectly . Suddenly the bruiser saw the doe and started bounding toward her . Then the buck paused , sealing his fate . " The second I pulled the trigger I knew he would make the book , " says Roy , who is selective after 20 years of hunting . " I try to only shoot bucks that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brother-in-law 's store , Lake Country Outdoors , the 10-pointer received a net score of 183 as a typical . It stands as the largest deer taken in Russell County and is a sign of a successful shift in deer management . Roy , for the most part , has been able to avoid the media spotlight . " A couple of guys called , trying to buy the rack , but I did n't sell . " Tony Lovstuen By the time the 2003 season rolled around , everyone who cared to know where the buck was living already knew : He was living on a farm just outside the small town of Albia , Iowa . Steve Angran found a set of sheds from the incredible buck ( already gross scoring over 280 inches ) while turkey hunting during the spring of 2001 . During the summer , a pair of local hunters filmed and photographed the buck , and quickly the small circle of those in the know began to grow . Steve really wanted to see the buck make it through the ensuing gun season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin , Doug Lovstuen , shot and wounded the buck during Iowa 's shotgun slug season . His gut-wrenching search for the carcass lasted more than two months . Toward the end of that time , Steve began getting pictures of the buck on his trail camera ; it was alive and well . But he let Doug keep searching . The best thing that could happen to Steve was for everyone to think the buck was dead . In January , the photos taken by the two local hunters during the summer and a story of the " walking world record " showed up in several national hunting magazines , including OUTDOOR LIFE . Though it took a little detective work to figure out where the deer lived , soon the whole deer-hunting world had turned its collective gaze toward little Albia and the farm where Steve was hunting . Bit by bit , the family members learned the buck was still alive , and those most serious about hunting it ( Angran , Lovstuen and later Mark Murphy ) came together to work as a team rather than as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation , the cousins decided to work together and hunt the deer during every legal season without regard for who might shoot it . The first chance was Iowa 's early youth season , which starts in mid-September . Out of the hunting group , only Doug 's son Tony , 15 years old , was young enough to participate . Tony Lovstuen enjoyed hunting , but he had never shot a deer . Doug and Tony practiced during August for the blackpowder youth season together , using Doug 's muzzleloader . Tony was ready when opening day rolled around , but the buck was a no-show . Mark had patterned the buck 's summer behavior and range very well with trail cameras during the months leading up to the hunt , but after the buck shed his velvet he was unpredictable . On September 29 the buck stepped out . It was Tony 's fifth evening of hunting . Tony , Doug and Mark had piled into the blind that afternoon , and there was quite a commotion when the buck appeared 75 yards away across a small grass field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoring at the Boone and Crockett National Convention last spring , the buck 's final score was 307 inches . It made the 15-year-old 's first deer the largest non-typical ever shot by a hunter.Bill Winke Marlon Vander Heiden " I get so frustrated with not being able to hunt much , " Marlon Vander Heiden of New Liberty , Iowa , bemoans . His complaint is easily the number one aggravation hunters have during deer season . It is especially difficult for Vander Heiden because he , along with his brother and father , run a pig farm . With nearly 1,000 pigs born each month , it 's rare that Vander Heiden can get in the field . During the first week of shotgun season Vander Heiden hunts with his brothers , but for the rest of the year he goes solo . He might not get out often , but his lucky streak is mind-boggling . The smallest of his seven mounts is in the 140s . By early January , Vander Heiden still had a landowner 's tag to fill and only a couple of days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pig slop he had 30 minutes to hunt . Grabbing a muzzleloader he made for the fields . He wore no camo and put on no scent . " Pig waste is about the best cover scent you can get and I was covered in it , " says Vander Heiden . On the edge of a timber line he glassed a herd of deer moving toward him . He tried to move around them but kicked up a doe . Luckily the skittish doe did n't spook the herd . Vander Heiden set up on the crest of a hill . Below , 30-odd deer grazed , including a respectable eight-pointer . Planting his scope on the buck , Vander Heiden was about to fire when a monster buck appeared behind the other one . The buck looked at him and the wind was wrong , but that hog mess kept Vander Heiden hidden . " I did n't have time to react , or even to get nervous , " he says . He shot , and the hunt turned into a vaudeville act . The buck took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teens after cops bust a prom party . Vander Heiden 's scope whipped his sunglasses off , and the smoke blinded him . Cursing with poetic license , he struggled and struggled to get another cap in the muzzleloader . His eyesight returned and he saw that the buck had fallen . " It was embarrassing . It happened just like some silly story , " he says . The whitetail scored 183 7/8 typical . Vander Heiden learned first-hand the trickiness of scoring . " If it had 2/8 more of an inch it would be the state muzzleloader record , " he says . Consider how small that is ; it 's about the size of a shirt button . A shirt button kept him from the state record , but with his luck he 'll break it next year . Paul Hofer Paul Hofer has a huge advantage over almost every deer hunter on the continent each time he climbs into the stand . That 's because he lives in Buffalo County , Wisc. , one of the great whitetail areas of the world . His trophy kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Club and two Boone and Crockett Club bucksand most of them are from his parents ' small farm . Hofer almost always hunts alone . " People think it 's a little strange , " he says . Still , he prefers his bow , tree stand and the solitude of the farm . When he was 13 years old he acquired a 40-pound K-Mart bow and taught himself to shoot . " Everyone back then hunted during the gun season . It was a carnival atmosphere when it started , " he says . Since no one in his family bowhunted , Hofer developed his own technique with no instruction . For years he did n't shoot anything . Hofer spends his evenings working the farm after finishing a day job . That gives him plenty of time to single out deer worth pursing . " I do n't scout . I just watch what happens in the field while I farm , " he says . In the fall of 2000 , his trail camera took a photograph of a huge non-typical buck . For the next two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , a neighboring landowner discovered a massive shed , giving Hofer hope that the big buck was alive . From the first of October through the close of the season , he was on the stand every evening . On October 13 , he noticed movement 80 yards away from his stand , but the late-day light can play tricks on the eyes . " I thought it was a groundhog , " he says . But then one tine appeared , followed by another , and soon a buck emerged from the tree line . The buck put his head down to feed , giving Hofer a sitting target . He drew his bow and let the arrow fly . But he missed . The arrow went just over the deer 's front shoulders . Amazingly , the deer did n't notice . By the time the rut began Hofer had saved up enough vacation time to take several days off for hunting . " Just seeing deer makes the day worth it , " Hofer says . But not one deer showed up on his first full day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fidget on the stand . Like a meditating monk , he is focused entirely on hunting deer , up to 12 hours straight in a day . By November 7 , though , he was feeling disheartened . Another full morning on the stand , and no deer . That afternoon , as the shadows grew long again , Hofer noticed movement on the edge of the field . A buck appeared about 40 yards away and he recognized it . It was the same one from October . As he began to draw , the buck looked up and locked eyes with him . The deer did n't notice anything strange , though . Hofer shot , and the arrow flew straight , piercing both lungs . " I asked my dad to give me a hand with the deer , " Hofer says . " He took one look at it and said , ' There 's no way I 'm helping you drag that out . ' " The 7 1/2-year-old buck field-dressed 205 pounds and the rack weighed 8 3/4 pounds . Hofer scored the buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a non-typical net score of 224 7/8 . While at home after the season Hofer developed a forgotten roll of film from his trail camera . To his surprise there was a shot of his stellar buck ; a keepsake to go along with the trophy mount . Justin Simmons The night before the opening of Kansas 's rifle season , Justin Simmons of Pratt was on the phone going through last-minute strategies with his dad back in New York . Simmons was skeptical of his hunting location . His friend , Eric England , convinced him to give Unit 16 a chance , but Simmons thought for sure the bruiser bucks would be on his traditional hunting ground to the south , Unit 15 . England really wanted to hunt Unit 16 because the summer before he had seen what he believed was a respectable 10-pointer four times . At 5 a.m . Simmons sent his father an e-mail . It read , " Off to hunt . I 'll send you pictures of the big one by noon . " The morning was typical of late fall on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind that pierced every layer of clothing . By 8 a.m . Simmons was freezing . Moving his stand was the best way to get his blood flowing . He radioed his buddy , who wanted to fight the cold by doing a drive . " Eric joked that it was so cold , if he shot he would blow his arm off , " Simmons says . The deer were in the area but bedded down because of the stiff breeze . In essence , the two were giving up on the day 's prospects . The typical Kansas terrain is harsh but ideal . The private farm Simmons hunted is half timber and half open fields . Grass in the open fields reaches 5 to 6 feet . It 's possible to walk within an arm 's length of bedded deer without either party knowing the other is there . England broke a twig in the field . Three does jumped , running up a slight hill in front of them . England took a shot , and a doe fell at the top of the incline . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves . Simmons looked up to see a buck sprinting away . In Kansas the limit is one buck per season . Simmons was reluctant to pull the trigger on just any deer two hours into opening day but this one looked impressive . In the thrill of the hunt , pondering a deer 's size as he runs away is an exercise in futility . Simmons whistled once , causing the deer to turn and slow . He shouldered his .30/06 and fired one shot at 160 yards . For a moment , he was n't sure if he 'd hit the buck , but it fell after a couple of bounds . When they reached the buck , all Simmons could say was , " That ai n't a ten-pointer . " No , it was a 31-pointer on a 5 by 5 mainframe . After 60 days it unofficially scored 241 1/8 as a non-typical . Before a hunt , hunters often boast of the trophies they will shoot . If Simmons did any boasting , he backed it up that day . By noon , digital images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyberspace . Kent Marr " I was in the right place at the right time ; my brother was n't , " says Kent Marr of Coyville , Kan . An outdoorsman 's clich for sure , but it 's especially true for Marr . If his 222 3/8 non-typical buck had wandered in the other direction , his brother would be giving the interviews . Kent and his brother Jan live in a small farming town with a population of 79 people and have watched city slickers buy up hunting rights to many surrounding properties . " Deer hunting has been turned into a money sport around here , " Marr says . Luckily , his commitment to the community provides him with a few places to hunt . One friend in particular , Carolyn , allows Marr to hunt her mother 's 200-acre farm . Marr was glassing from the back deck of her farmhouse on the Friday before the muzzleloader opener . Carolyn told Marr that one deer was sporting a very hefty rack . Sure enough , in the waning light of a Midwestern evening , Marr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jaw-dropping 200-class buck . The set-up was perfect ; the deer were showing up within a 10-minute timeframe every evening . They were uneducated and felt safe . Once the deer left the field , Marr selected a tree-stand site , and Carolyn helped him construct a ground blind for his brother using hay bales . Marr 's brother Jan can not hunt from a tree stand because of a handicap . The hunt was falling into place perfectly . Then the rains came . Opening morning rains left the ground moist . " I figured we were n't going to hunt . I did n't want to tear up her fields driving to the ground blind . " Instead Marr and his brother watched the Kansas football game . By the second half , Kansas had the lead , the rain was gone and Marr 's phone was ringing off the hook . It was Carolyn and she sounded excited . " She told me to get to her land by 5 p.m. , no excuses , " says Marr . At the farm Marr parked the pickup truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked across the alfalfa field to a grove of trees to place his stand . Shortly after 7 p.m. , the buck appeared and stood like a wishbone between the two brothers . If he broke in one direction Jan would get him , in the other and the rack would belong to Kent . ( And if he turned back into the woods he would live . ) The deer chose Kent 's side . Shouldering his muzzleloader , Kent fired . The deer bolted past his brother , who saw a lot of blood pouring out . The brothers used a tractor to haul the buck to an elevator scale . Its live weight was 275 pounds . " I do n't ever go to the city unless it 's to see a doctor , " Marr says . " But I had to take the buck to Wichita to get it scored . Man , is that a process ! " The trip was worthwhile , though , because the deer is one of the largest on record in Kansas . SIDEBAR The Dryden Buck In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers eyed a 199-inch typical ( possibly a new Ontario record ) that they suspected was poached . The officers had gotten a tip that gunshots were heard after dark . But the hunters were nowhere to be seen . Instead of posing with their trophy , two men from Louisiana were in a hurry to get out of Canada . ( The man at right helped officers recover the buck . ) The two were charged with 12 counts of illegally hunting this 18-pointer and one other deer . SIDEBAR Do You Remember Mitch Rompola ? He stood the whitetail world on its head in 1998 when a photo of him posing with a massive 12-pointer appeared . The buck reportedly scored between 216 and 218 and was heralded as a new world-record typical . But doubters emerged , claiming the deer was a fraud . The already reclusive Rompola became a hermit , refusing to display the animal in public . The deer was unofficially panel scored , but no one inspected the skull plate . Then Rompola made a strange move . He signed an agreement with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not promote the deer as a world record . According to those who know him , he 's moved on . In fact , he still kills world-class bucks , including one that scored in the 180s . But we have to ask : If Mitch Rompola did shoot a new world record , why was n't he willing to have the deer scored officially and entered into the record book ? SIDEBAR Two Record Deer Poached Ohio DNR officer Charlie Stone has been on the job for almost 22 years . But this is the first time where both the number one typical and non-typical in the state could be disqualified for poaching . Greg Jones 's case goes like this : He shot a mighty impressive buck on the afternoon of October 22 . The next morning he checked in the deer . Sixty days passed and the buck scored a very respectable 182 4/8 typical . After the season , Stone 's partner , officer George Foreman , was looking for anything suspicious in the tag recordsstandard procedure , according to Stone . A red flag came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are databased online with a code to determine the date and time of purchase . " This was a textbook case , " Stone says . Jones killed the deer , was ecstatic about the size and wanted it to be legal . Problem was , he did n't have a license . He bought the license and tagged the deer the next morning . Of course , Jones had his excuse . " He claimed he resided on land owned by his girlfriend 's parents and was therefore the tenant , " says Stone . But that did n't fly with the DNR . The financial penalties were n't crippling . Jones incurred a $90 fine and $65 court costs . But the kicker was mandatory forfeiture of the mount . As of press time a 229 P &Y; non-typical whitetail is also under investigation by the DNR . " Deer are the most significant poaching issue in Ohio , " Stone says . SIDEBAR Shooting for the Book What are the chances of shooting a buck worthy of entry into the Boone and Crockett Club 's record book ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consider these numbers : Roughly 5.5 million deer are killed each year by hunters , while the average number of B &C; book entries per year since 2000 is about 300 . Without taking into consideration location , weather and time of year , your chance of bagging a record trophy by just showing up to any old tree stand is 0.0005 percent . And the odds only get slightly better if you 're hunting a proven hot spot , like Buffalo County , Wis. , or Allamakee County , Iowa . Between 2000 and 2003 , Buffalo County hunters took 33,580 deer , yet just 14 were eligible for B &C; entry . That works out to a 0.04 percent chance . Allamakee County is about as good as it gets . With a total harvest of 13,780 deer , 8 made the book , putting the odds for entry at 0.06 percent . But you never know : As with the lottery , people win every day . That 's for sure . SIDEBAR World 's Luckiest Hunter ? The scene : It was a few hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Neb . Most hunters were taking care of last-minute preparations , but not Chuck Allen . He was browsing the rifle selection at Dan Weddle 's gun shop , The Lower Forty . Allen still did n't have a firearm for the next day . Because of the time constraints ( he still did n't have a tree stand location ) he agreed with Weddle that a package gun was his bestand onlyoption . Weddle suggested a Savage 111 chambered in 7mm mag . Allen dry-fired it a few times and Weddle checked the factory-mounted scope with a boresighter . After their " rigorous " inspection Allen decided to buy the rifle . Once the tree stand was placed the next morning , Allen sat , waiting for some action . Soon , the recognizable sounds of a walking deer snapped him from a daydream . When Allen saw the buck , he almost dropped his gun ( which had still not been fired ) . It was a big one , the biggest he 'd ever seen . Without hesitation he squeezed off a round , and the buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typical . Allen ( with the buck , at left ) has rewritten the rules of hunting : Do n't worry about scouting or test-firing . After all , as Woody Allen put it , " Eighty percent of success is just showing up . " But we have to offer this advice : It definitely helps to sight-in that rifle first . This article contains a table . Please see hardcopy of magazine or PDF . Hottest Day November 8 , 2003 , was the best day of last season for harvesting a B &C; buck . On that stellar day , 15 were killed . ( It probably helps that it was a Saturday . ) Big Buck Outlook Where will the next world-record whitetail come from ? " For quite a while I would have said Illinois , but the next top-end buck will come from Iowa .
