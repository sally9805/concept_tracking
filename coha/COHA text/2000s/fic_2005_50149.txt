It 's open to debate whether Scott Bradfield is really a reincarnation of Aesop , but there 's no doubt that he is a master of the animal fable . His tales of dazzling dogs , emailing cats , and hard-drinking penguins tend to show up modern life in ways no one else 's stories do . Here we have a case in point , the true tale of a duck with an axe to grind . This story comes from Mr. Bradfield 's collection Hot Animal Love , which is due out in a month or so from Carroll &; Graf . <p> Mercy ! What a speech - from what a bird ! - Merrill , The Changing Light at Sandover Arnold Hingley - colleague A. OF COURSE I RESPECTED SAMMY . BUT ca n't say I liked him much . I do n't want this to sound prejudiced or anything , but he did n't fit in around here , if you know what I mean . And yet , funny thing was , I was probably his closest friend in the department ; we even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disorganized he was . Especially that damn plastic wading pool of his , and the whiskey bottles and Jiffy Pop bags everywhere , maybe I should n't get into it . I 'll just say Sammy did things his own way . Like he did n't know any other . Q. What about his work ? A. Are you asking if I 've read it ? Q. ( unintelligible ) A. Yeah , I read it , maybe not that carefully or anything , it 's not my kind of stuff . I 'm more a Keats and Arnold sort of man - but do n't print that , okay ? It does n't sound right , and I do n't mean to disparage him . Because , okay , he was n't easy to get along with , and maybe I 'm not that big into modern poetry . But you had to respect his integrity . Sammy never compromised his vision . He always told the world exactly what he wanted to say . Beverly Dunn - college teacher A. He just waddled into class one day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waddled up from the local pond and straight into my Intro Poetry Workshop . He did n't understand the add/drop procedures , had n't submitted any work for review , just came in and sat down like he belonged . He had this , oh , this swagger about him , right from the start . Of course it was defensive . He was terrified of being found out , pointed at , ridiculed . So he acted above it all , tough on the outside , like any true artist would . I ca n't tell you how many poets just never make it because , well . They do n't have that toughness . They do n't have that mean streak to carry them through . At the same time , nobody can write like Sammy without accessing some pretty deep emotional stuff . Despite that exterior toughness , he was an easy duck to hurt , my Sammy-boy . So when I heard about the world tour and how he was n't coming back , I just . I mean . Q. Are you all right ? A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should we take a break ? A. No , I 'm fine . Really . I was just saying that he was full of beauty , our Sammy . And brave in so many ways . The sort of student who walks into class and you know right off . This is the real thing . This kid 's a poet . It 's important for a teacher , helping a student like that . It makes all the other , excuse me , all the other bullshit - the whining no-talents , the administrative hassles , the tenure battles - worth going through . Because you know a student like Sammy is waiting at the end of it . Waiting just for you . Q. ( unintelligible ) A. Of course I miss him . He 's the best student I ever had . And he was n't fully formed , either . He needed help and he appreciated it . He made me feel important for the first time in my life and I 'll always miss that feeling . I 'll always miss the best student I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a funny way . I 'll always miss Sammy the Duck . Aaron Cormier - fellow poet A. A girl . It does n't matter what species you are , right ? It 's always a girl . Q. What was her name ? A. I do n't know how much I can tell you . She started showing up for readings about the same time Sammy was developing his reputation in local coffee shops , always sat in the back , dressed to the max , totally in white except for that olive skin of hers , Catalan skin , but all the rest of her blonde and dazzling - with whiteness , you could n't turn her off , man , you could n't blot her out with a blackout curtain . White stilettos , short white skirts , white fishnet stockings , always too much and always just a little too far away . She did n't pay any attention to the rest of us . She did n't even like poetry . She just came to the readings to be near him . And when he read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world but her . Q. What was their relationship like ? A. Their relationship was their relationship , what do I know . At first , she would come and listen and , soon as it was over , she 'd split . Afterwards , Sammy 'd go looking for her , but she 'd be vanished , man , like into her own whiteness . And then , somewhere along the way , they just linked up , nobody knows how , and she was suddenly always around . Kind of like his Yoko . Whenever you saw Sammy , there she 'd be . Sitting beside him and stroking his back . Bunny Fairchild - agent A. I heard about him from Beverly , she invited me out for the Eliot Awards . Sammy won first place that year , already getting national coverage , and the best part ? That kid knew how to handle a crowd . He 'd waddle up to the mike with total self-control , huge with confidence , especially for a duck . This is me , his body language told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't remember what he read - I just remember the confidence , it was like something separate from Sammy , not part of who he really was at all . Always one eye on the crowd , never letting them off the hook , saying this is me and this is what I 've come to say . The crowd loved him for it . Q. How soon did you take him on ? A. I went home that night , made some calls , and had five figures by morning . I know five figures does n't sound like much , but in the world of poetry ? We 're talking space-rocket , darling . And Sammy and I were riding it straight to the moon . Arnold Hingley - colleague A. I always felt he brought the drinking with him . It was certainly a full-blown problem by the time he got here , all the usual clichs . Bottles in the filing cabinets , not showing for classes , shuffling down the hallways half-sloshed in his bathrobe and slippers . We 're pretty sure he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess I 'd find some mornings . But people who knew him say it started with his first book , The Angry Elegies . Did n't know what he 'd done or how to do it again . Sophomore blues . And of course , you do n't need to know much about Sammy 's work to see it 's all about anger . He had to let it out . For Sammy , that 's what self expression was about . Q. How was he with the students ? A. Ask the students . Q. Would you have any of their names ? A. I was Acting Associate Head that year , and I heard the complaints , usual stuff about how their grades were n't high enough , teacher was n't fair and so on . But the complaints against Sammy , how should I put this . Q. How should you put it ? A. Q. Professor Hingley ? A. I think I 'll just leave it at that . Theresa O'Day - student A. He hit on me . Q. What do you mean " he hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? He hit on me . He made improper advances like every chance he got . Kept trying to climb up on my lap , especially if I was wearing a skirt , swear to God . Kept asking me to scratch his tail feathers . That kind of hitting on me . You want me to draw a picture ? I was like barely twenty years old and feeling really impressionable and he really , you know , like they say in the Student Handbook . He misused his disciplinary authority as mentor . So I filed a complaint with Prof. Hingley , and know what he did ? Blew me off . Getting hit on and getting blown off . That 's what this stupid English department is all about . Q. What about his teaching methods ? How was he at communicating with the students ? A. You 're putting me on . Q. A. Mainly he 'd come to class totally sloshed , drinking something out of this chipped blue ceramic mug that said Bawdy Bard on it , smelled like rotgot gin , swear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling off his desk , flapping like crazy , feathers everywhere . Then he 'd read this crappy poetry he was writing , something about the universe , and we were all bound up in the metaphor , he called it a philosophical prose-poem or something , it did n't make any sense at all . He kept referring to it as his " second book , " but I heard he never wrote a second book . I heard he wrote the first book , got all famous and so forth , and that was it . Bye-bye , birdy . Q. When was the last time you saw him ? A. When he gave me that fucking C and I came looking for him and I knew he was in his office , I could hear him snoring behind the door and I started pounding on the door , I did n't care who heard me , and shouting , " You gave me a fucking C ! You make me scratch your fucking tailfeathers all semester and you gave me a fucking C ? " And he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . I 'm sorry , you know .. .1 mean , what happened to him on that world tour , it was terrible and all . But I 'm afraid I do n't feel any compassion in my heart . That was one mean , selfish duck . And I do n't care if his first book of poetry really was such a big deal and all . Aaron Cormier - friend and fellow poet A. I 'd like to read you something . Q. Please . A. It 's one thing to sit around talking about Sammy , and dredging up his past , things he said and did and probably shouldn't 've and so forth . But I want to read you something that 's really about Sammy , probably the first thing I ever heard of his ... here . The beginning of the " Pond Cycle " in the Elegies . I 'm sure you know it . Q. Of course I know it . A. These days , everybody with a BA knows it . It goes like this : Fucking ducks - You fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking stupid , stupid fucking smelly pondwater scum You stupid . Fucking . Ducks . Quack qauck quack quack quack quack quack quack ( ad infinitum ) - quack . Would you please just shut the fuck up . SHUT UP ! SHUT UP ! SHUT UP ! ! ! You fucking , fucking ducks . Q. A. There 's nothing to say about something like that , is there ? Because it 's poetry , man . It speaks for itself , and that 's what Sammy was all about . Not the drinking and the gossipy bullshit you 're looking for , or the failure that haunted him , or that tragic world tour . It 's the poetry , what he had in his heart . Anger and beauty , more than anybody can bear . And he made a gift of it to all of us . Q. ( unintelligible ) A. Well , I 'll just leave that to you and the talking heads at PBS to decide , wo n't I ? Alfred A. Bolger - editor A. No , I do n't think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we put any pressure on him at all . Only Sammy put any pressure on Sammy . Sure , we had good receipts on the first book , but there were also a lot of returns , so while we definitely intended to stick with Sammy over the long haul , how should I put this ? We 're committed to publishing good contemporary poetry here at Knopf . But at the same time , we 're not actually champing at the bit to publish it in today 's marketplace . It takes the wind out of your sails , commercially speaking . Q. Did he show you what he was working on ? A. Yes , he did . You know , it 's no secret , the second book 's always a bitch , especially if you feel as passionate about your work as Sammy . And there was some good stuff in it - do n't get me wrong . It was definitely ambitious . I 'm not entirely certain , but I think basically what Sammy wanted to do was tackle the cosmic Blakean nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you have any early drafts ? A. Well , maybe , but that would n't really be fair to Sammy . He was n't happy with it . The work was inconsistent and he knew it . And then the social stuff started getting in his way , the readings , the job at New England U , and he got increasingly involved with that , I probably should n't say this , but that succubus , the Lady in White . I ca n't remember her name . Q. Lola Montez . A. Yeah . You meet girls like her all the time on the poetry circuit . Olive skin . Depthless black eyes . Dressed entirely in white . Girl had legs up to her neck . Q. You did n't like her much . A. Q. You were saying . A. How I felt about Lola never mattered . She was this natural force that picked Sammy up and put him down again when she was finished and then suddenly it was too late . There was nothing anybody could do but sweep up the feathers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sammy . Quack quack quack quack quack . Sammy sammy quack quack quack , Mister Bigshot , Mister Bigshot . Quack quack quack quack . Crackers crackers crackers , gim me more crackers and I 'll quack quack quack quack . Who reads poetry anyway quack quack quack . What 's the big deal anyway quack quack quack quack . Where 's Mister Bigshot now , that 's what I ask you ? Quack quack quack quack quack . Where 's Mister Bigshot now ? Herr Doktor Hans Fischer - critic and academic A. Ja , we had the distinct pleasure of meeting Herr Sammy during his first European tour , and it was a great honor for him to visit our modest Book Fair in Erlangen . He spoke , I guess it was for several hours , on the importance of his work and his reasons for literary triumph in the mass market . However , I fear he may have been drinking too much Weissbier both previous to and concurrently with the discussion of his work , but it is not unusual to witness this form of behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very honored by his appearance , however , and impressed that he had flown so far to be with us . His lady friend was very charming also , though I can never remember her name quite correctly . Q. Lola Montez . A. I believe that is accurate . She was a very lovely girl all dressed in white , who did not speak too much to anybody other than Sammy , but you always knew she was present . I believe that Sammy was the first avian poet to have performed his readings in Erlangen , making him the subject of many interesting reviews and profiles in the German Culture Pages . Though , as I recall , Sammy did not like to be referred to as an avian poet , which he considered very derogatory . We sympathized with this viewpoint very much . Q. It may have been his last public appearance . A. I believe I have heard this also . He discoursed at length on the topic of being a poet in an age of commercial hypocrisy , and expressed many interesting , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eradication of the ozone layer , human hunting laws , the arrogance of NASA , and the fact that his poetry was not about being a duck , which to me was especially interesting . Instead , he said his poetry was about expressing the ineffable , I believe he was to characterize it as the cosmic animal dilemma of all creatures who aspire to Godhood . Though there were times , I must confess , when he was very confusing , perhaps it was my poor English language skills . And when he fell off the podium and lost consciousness , we were unable to pursue these interesting topics any further . Q. You say he read something . A. This is accurate . And I have taken the liberty to preserve a page from what he read during his presentation . He described it as a book he was working on concerning his Blakean revision of totality . I am not a professional reader , nor is my English very proficient , but I shall enunciate as clearly as possible : quack quack quack quack quack steady-state theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quack not your anxiety of afflatulence Mister Man quack quack quack quack aspirational Godhood quack quack quack duck not I not duck quack quack quack quack quack apex of whiteness quack quack quack quack- And so forth . It is not so easy to read , however , for it has been written with red felt pen on the back of this stained bar napkin which is falling to pieces , as you see . But it does provide an indication of where he was going in his further creative endeavors . I , for one , look forward to a critical edition of his final papers very much . Aaron Cormier - friend and fellow poet A. We 'll never know , will we ? The only person who will know is Lola , and she is n't exactly speaking volumes . Q. When was the last time you saw her ? A. We held a memorial for Sammy at the Poetry Caf , took turns reading from the Elegies , reminisced , got drunk . I 'm pretty sure I saw her drive up outside - I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central Connecticut drive a palomino-white convertible BMW ? She came up to the door and hesitated , but I did n't see her come in . Maybe she felt responsible for what happened in Thailand . Maybe some of us felt she was responsible , too . Q. Do you think Sammy was self-destructive ? A. He was very self-destructive . That goes without saying . As a poet , he took the biggest step imaginable to produce his first book . He climbed up out of the pond , and turned his back on everything he 'd ever been , and everybody he ever knew . There was only one place to go after that . Into the next book . Turning his back on any world that made him feel like he belonged . Success , New York , us , the world . For Sammy , poetry was always an act of expiation . It did n't surprise me when he let Lola book that tour of Asia and the Mideast . In a funny way , it did n't even surprise me what happened to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy ? Who told him to get drunk and go wandering alone through the streets of Singapore , even if he was carrying a copy of Rilke under his arm ? Those people like their water fowl . They 're not going to invite you into their little street-side caf and pump you full of Malaysian hooch to get you reading from your next book . And I do n't care how many stars you received in Kirkus . Beverly Dunn - teacher A. This is the grade book I used for his first class , there he is . Sammy the Duck . He was never actually enrolled at the University , - so I signed him in through Adult Ed . And here 's one of his early poems , it was eventually revised as a concluding " outrage " in the Elegies . Oh , and look , a box of crackers I kept around for his tutorials . That was one thing about the pond Sammy never left behind . His passion for crackers and popcorn . Lola Montez - friend A I do n't have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to ask a few questions about Sammy . A. I know what you want to ask me . Why ca n't you just let him rest in peace ? Q. People are interested in Sammy , Lola . Some are even interested in you . A. You do n't understand , do you ? I do n't want to talk about him . I just want you people to get out of here and leave me alone . Beverly Dunn - teacher A. Of course I remember the first thing he ever said to me . He waddled into class that day and took a seat , never once acted like he did n't totally belong , just muscled through the roughest sea , that was our Sammy . And nobody said anything . I was taking roll , looking for his name on the list , the students all pretending not to notice , I did n't know what to say . And then I looked at him and we made eye contact , he was staring right at me , waiting for me to acknowledge his presence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . He was going to say something to me . " Quack , " he said . " Quack quack . " It was so Sammy . But then you 'd have to have known him like I did to know exactly how Sammy it was . <p>
