Shirley Spookie House , which is where I live with my aunt Tabitha and my uncle Drac , has recently gotten pretty crowded . First of all I found two ghosts living here , and then the Wizzards turned up and decided to live here too . So now that makes eight of us , as there are three Wizzards  --  Wanda and her mom and dad , Brenda and Barry . Our two ghosts are Sir Horace and Edmund . Most people think that Sir Horace is just a boring old suit of armor  --  which is what I thought for ages  --  but he is our biggest ghost . Then there is his faithful page , Edmund , who is shy and acts like he 's a bit of a wimp . Wanda really likes him , but she would , as she can be a bit of a wimp too , as you will see . Sometimes I think Sir Horace likes Wanda better than me . Not that I am jealous or anything , even though Sir Horace was my ghost first . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Horace so that he looked almost like new , and Wanda got rid of all Sir Horace 's rust with her bike oil , which he was really pleased about . After that , Sir Horace walked around a lot more than he used to . He did n't creak anymore either , which was a bit weird , as sometimes you might be just hanging around planning an ambush for Aunt Tabby orsomething , and suddenly there would be Sir Horace , standing right behind you . But last month Sir Horace stopped walking around and started getting sulky . He took to lurking behind some revolting old curtains on the landing , and one night he really frightened Uncle Drac when he let out a horrible groan just as Uncle Drac was coming out of his turret . Another time Sir Horace deliberately took his head off and left it on the stairs . Aunt Tabby tripped over it and blamed me . When I gave him his head back , he was not polite at all . He told me that he was trying to forget something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you very much . But I made him put it back on . After that he disappeared . We looked everywhere , but we could n't find him , so Wanda and I went down to his secret room to see if he was there . To get to Sir Horace 's room , you have to go through a secret passage and then down in a funny old elevator , called a dumbwaiter , which you have to work yourself by pulling on a rope . Wanda and I are not allowed to go there , as Aunt Tabby says the elevator is dangerous , and she does not like us hanging around in secret passages . But the real reason is that Aunt Tabby does not like people being anywhere where she can not see what they are doing , as she is extremely nosy . But even though Aunt Tabby is so nosy , she does not know everything . For example , she does not know that I have the key to the door to the secret passage . So yesterday , when Wanda and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , we opened the secret door , which is in the paneling under the attic stairs . We walked along the secret passage . I had to go first because of the spiders  --  which Wanda does not like  --  then we went down in the creaky elevator  --  which Wanda does not like  --  and went into Sir Horace 's room . The room was very small and dark  --  Wanda did not like that , either . But I do n't know what else she expected , as there are no windows in it because it is a secret room in the middle of the house . I shone my flashlight into all the corners to see if Sir Horace was sulking there while Wanda looked scared . " He 's not here , " said Wanda . " I hope he has n't run away . " " Why would he do that ? " I asked . " He likes it at our house . Can I have the cheese and onion chips ? " Wanda was carrying our Secret Passage Kit , and she gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lit the two candles above the fireplace . They cast strange shadows on the walls , and I made a big monster shadow loom over her . Wanda , who is even more nosy than my aunt Tabby , started looking through all the old books that were piled up . They were very boring , and I did n't know why she was bothering , but Wanda likes boring old stuff  --  which is why she likes Sir Horace , I suppose . Anyway , suddenly Wanda snorted like a pig inhaling its food and started rolling around the floor . I did n't take any notice , as I know that this is Wanda 's way of laughing . So I let her do her pig impression for a bit , and then I asked her what was so funny . " Oink oink oink , " snorted Wanda , " oh , oink ! " " Oh , come on , Wanda . Tell me . " Wanda shoved a funny old book into my hands . " Shirley , " she snorted . " Oink oink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of paper with a picture someone had drawn of a cute baby lying on a rug . Underneath the picture was some spidery writing . It was not very easy to read . " Go on . . . oink , " snorted Wanda . " Read it . " " Er . . . ' Horace Cuthbert Shirley George , age foure monthe , ' " I read out . " Their spelling was terrible in the old days , was n't it ? " " Not as bad as yours , " oinked Wanda . " See ? He 's called Shirley . " " Well , maybe his mom wanted a girl or something . Anyway , I think he looks sweet . But that ca n't be Sir Horace . He was never a baby . " Wanda managed to sit up . " Everyone was a baby once , " she said . " Even my dad was a baby once , although that was ages ago . Probably about the same time as when Sir Horace was a baby . " " Your dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nearly five hundred years old , " I said , staring at the date in the book . Continues ...
