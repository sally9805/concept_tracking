When I was a little girl I used to dress Barbie up without underpants . On the outside , she 'd look like the perfect lady . Tasteful plastic heels , tailored suit . But underneath , she was naked . I 'm a bail enforcement agent now  - -  also known as a fugitive apprehension agent , also known as a bounty hunter . I bring ' em back dead or alive . At least I try . And being a bail enforcement agent is sort of like being bare-bottom Barbie . It 's about having a secret . And it 's about wearing a lot of bravado on the outside when you 're really operating without underpants . Okay , maybe it 's not like that for all enforcement agents , but I frequently feel like my privates are alfresco . Figuratively speaking , of course . At the moment I was n't feeling nearly so vulnerable . What I was feeling at the moment was desperate . My rent was due , and Trenton had run out of scofflaws . I had my hands palms down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard as I tried , I could n't keep my voice from sounding like it was coming out of Minnie Mouse . " What do you mean there are no FTAs ? There are always FTAs . " " Sorry , " Connie said . " We 've got lots of bonds posted , but nobody 's jumping . Must have something to do with the moon . " FTA is short for failure to appear for a court date . Going FTA is a definite no-no in the criminal justice system , but that does n't usually stop people from doing it . Connie slid a manila folder over to me . " This is the only FTA I 've got , and it 's not worth much . " Connie is the office manager for Vincent Plum Bail Bonds . She 's a couple years older than me , which puts her in her early thirties . She wears her hair teased high . She takes grief from no on e . And if breasts were money Connie 'd be Bill Gates . " Vinnie 's overjoyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fistful . No bounty hunters to pay . No forfeited bonds . Last time I saw Vinnie in a mood like this was when Madame Zaretsky was arrested for pandering and sodomy and put her trained dog up as collateral for her bond . " I cringed at the mental image this produced because not only is Vincent Plum my employer , he 's also my cousin . I blackmailed him into taking me on as an apprehension agent at a low moment in my life and have come to sort of like the job ... most of the time . That does n't mean I have any illusions about Vinnie . For the most part , Vinnie is an okay bondsman . But privately , Vinnie is a boil on the backside of my family tree . As a bail bondsman Vinnie gives the court a cash bond as a securement that the accused will return for trial . If the accused takes a hike , Vinnie forfeits his money . Since this is n't an appealing prospect to Vinnie , he sends me out to find the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ten percent of the bond , and I only collect it if I 'm successful . I flipped the folder open and read the bond agreement . " Randy Briggs . Arrested for carrying concealed . Failed to appear at his court hearing . " The bond amount was seven hundred dollars . That meant I 'd get seventy . Not a lot of money for risking my life by going after someone who was known to carry . " I do n't know , " I said to Connie , " this guy carries a knife . " Connie looked at her copy of Briggs ' arrest sheet . " It says here it was a small knife , and it was n't sharp . " " How small ? " " Eight inches . " " That is n't small ! " " Nobody else wil l take this , " Connie said . " Ranger does n't take anything under ten grand . " Ranger is my mentor and a world-class tracker . Ranger also never seems to be in dire need of rent money . Ranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo attached to Briggs ' file . Briggs did n't look so bad . In his forties , narrow-faced and balding , Caucasian . Job description was listed as self-employed computer programmer . I gave a sigh of resignation and stuffed the folder into my shoulder bag . " I 'll go talk to him . " " Probably he just forgot , " Connie said . " Probably this is a piece of cake . " I gave her my yeah , right look and left . It was Monday morning and traffic was humming past Vinnie 's store front office . The October sky was as blue as sky gets in New Jersey , and the air felt crisp and lacking hydrocarbons . It was nice for a change , but it kind of took all the sport out of breathing . A new red Firebird slid to curbside behind my ' 53 Buick . Lula got out of the car and stood hands on hips , shaking her head . " Girl , you still driving that pimp mobile ? " Lula did filing for Vinnie and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life she 'd been a ' ho . She 's what is gently referred to as a big woman , weighing in at a little over 200 pounds , standing five-foot-five , looking like most of her weight 's muscle . This week her hair was dyed orange and came off very autumn with her dark brown skin . " This is a classic car , " I told Lula . Like we both knew I really gave a fig about classic cars . I was driving The Beast because my Honda had caught fire and burned to a cinder , and I did n't have any money to replace it . So here I was , borrowing my Uncle Sandor 's gas guzzl ing behemoth ... again . " Problem is , you are n't living up to your earning potential , " Lula said . " We only got chicken shit cases these days . What you need is to have a serial killer or a homicidal rapist jump bail . Those boys are worth something . " " Yeah , I 'd sure like to get a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me a homicidal rapist to chase down I 'd quit and get a job selling shoes . Lula marched into the office , and I slid behind the wheel and reread the Briggs file . Randy Briggs had given the same address for home and work . Cloverleaf Apartments on Grand Avenue . It was n't far from the office . Maybe a mile . I pulled into traffic , made an illegal U-turn at the intersection , and followed Hamilton to Grand . The Cloverleaf Apartments building was two blocks down Grand . It was red brick faced and strictly utilitarian . Three stories . A front and a back entrance . Small lot to the rear . No ornamentation . Aluminum-framed windows that were popular in the fifties and looked cheesy now . I parked in the lot and walked into the small lobby . There was an elevator to one side and stairs to the other . The elevator looked claustrophobic and unreliable , so I took the stairs to the second floor . Briggs was 2B . I stood outside his door for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . I pressed the doorbell and stood to the side , so I was n't visible through the security peep hole . Randy Briggs opened his door and stuck his head out . " Yeah ? " He looked exactly like his photo , with sandy blond hair that was neatly combed , cut short . He was unbearded , unblemished . Dressed in clean khakis and a button-down shirt . Just like I 'd expected from hi s file ... except he was only three feet tall . Randy Briggs was vertically challenged . " Oh shit , " I said , looking down at him . " What 's the matter ? " he said . " You never see a short person before ? " " Only on television . " " Guess this is your lucky day . " I handed him my business card . " I represent Vincent Plum Bail Bonds . You 've missed your court date , and we 'd appreciate it if you 'd reschedule . " " No , " Briggs said . " Excuse me ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to court . It was a bogus arrest . " " The way our system works is that you 're supposed to tell that to the judge . " " Fine . Go get the judge . " " The judge does n't do house calls . " " Listen , I got a lot of work to do , " Briggs said , closing his door . " I got ta go . " " Hold it ! " I said . " You ca n't just ignore an order to appear in court . " " Watch me . " " You do n't understand . I 'm appointed by the court and Vincent Plum to bring you in . " " Oh yeah ? How do you expect to do that ? You going to shoot me ? You ca n't shoot an unarmed man . " He stuck his hands out . " You gon na cuff me ? You think you can drag me out of my apartment and down the hall without looking like an idiot ? Big bad bounty hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're called , Toots . Not midget , not dwarf , not a freaking Munchkin . Little person . Get it ? " My pager went off at my waist . I looked down to check the read-out and slam . Briggs closed and locked his door . " Loser , " he called from inside . Well , that did n't go as smoothly as I 'd hoped . I had a choice now . I could break down his door and beat the bejeezus out of him , or I could answer my moth er 's page . Neither was especially appealing , but I decided on my mother . My parents live in a residential pocket of Trenton nicknamed the Burg . No one ever really leaves the Burg . You can relocate in Antarctica , but if you were born and raised in the Burg you 're a Burger for life . Houses are small and obsessively neat . Televisions are large and loud . Lots are narrow . Families are extended . There are no pooper-scooper laws in the Burg . If your dog does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning the doodoo will be on your front porch . Life is simple in the Burg . I put the Buick into gear , rolled out of the apartment building lot , headed for Hamilton , and followed Hamilton to St. Francis Hospital . My parents live a couple blocks behind St. Francis on Roosevelt Street . Their house is a duplex built at a time when families needed only one bathroom and dishes were washed by hand . My mother was at the door when I pulled to the curb . My grandmother Mazur stood elbow to elbow with my mother . They were short , slim women with facial features that suggested Mongol ancestors ... probably in the form of crazed marauders . " Thank goodness you 're here , " my mother said , eyeing me as I got out of the car and walked toward her . " What are those shoes ? They look like work boots . " " Betty Szajak and Emma Getz and me went to that male dancer place last week , " Grandma said , " and they had some men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like those . Then next thing you knew they ripped their clothes off and all they had left was those boots and these little silky black baggie things that their ding-dongs jiggled around in . " My mother pressed her lips together and made the sign of the cross . " You did n't tell me about this , " she said to my grandmother . " Guess it slipped my mind . Betty and Emma and me were going to Bingo at the church , but it turned out there was n't any Bingo on account of the Knights of Columbus was holding some to-do there . So we decided to check out the men at that new club downtown . " Grandma gave me an elbow . " I put a fiver right in one of those baggies ! " " Jesus H. Christ , " my father said , rattling his paper in the living room . Grandma Mazur came to live with my parents several years ago when my Grandpa Mazur went to the big poker game in the sky . My mother accepts this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading Guns &; Ammo . " So what 's up ? " I asked . " Why did you page me ? " " We need a detective , " Grandma said . My mother rolled her eyes and ushered me in to the kitchen . " Have a cookie , " she said , setting the cookie jar on the small Formica-topped kitchen table . " Can I get you a glass of milk ? Some lunch ? " I lifted the lid on the cookie jar and looked inside . Chocolate chip . My favorite . " Tell her , " Grandma said to my mother , giving her a poke in the side . " Wait until you hear this , " she said to me . " This is a good one . " I raised my eyebrows at my mother . " We have a family problem , " my mother said . " Your Uncle Fred is missing . He went out to the store and has n't come home yet . " " When did he go out ? " " Friday . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's Monday ! " " Is n't this a pip ? " Grandma said . " I bet he was beamed up by aliens . " Uncle Fred is married to my Grandma Mazur 's first cousin Mabel . If I had to guess his age I 'd have to say somewhere between seventy and infinity . Once people start to stoop and wrinkle they all look alike to me . Uncle Fred was someone I saw at weddings and funerals and once in awhile at Giovichinni 's Meat Market , ordering a quarter pound of olive loaf . Eddie Such , the butcher , would have the olive loaf on the scale and Uncle Fred would say , " You 've got the olive loaf on a piece of waxed paper . How much does that piece of waxed paper weigh ? You 're not gon na charge me for that waxed paper , are you ? I want some money off for the waxed paper . I shoved the cookie into my mouth . " Have you filed a missing persons report with the police ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And ? " " And they have n't found him . " I went to the refrigerator and poured out a glass of milk for myself . " What about the car ? Did they find the car ? " " The car was in the Grand Union parking lot . It was all locked up nice and neat . " " He was never right after that stroke he had in ninety-five , " Grandma said . " I do n't think his elevator went all the way to the top anymore , if you know what I mean . He could have just wandered off like one of those Alzheimer 's people . Anybody think to check the cereal aisle in the supermarket ? Maybe he 's just standing there ' cause he ca n't make up his mind . " My father mumbled something from the living room about my grandmother 's elevator , and my mother slid my father a dirty look through the kitchen wall . I thought it was too weird . Uncle Fred was missing . This sort of thing just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out to look for him ? " " Ronald and Walter . They covered all the neighbo rhoods around the Grand Union , but nobody 's seen him . " Ronald and Walter were Fred 's sons . And probably they 'd enlisted their kids to help , too . " We figure you 're just the person to take a crack at this , " grandma said , " on account of that 's what you do ... you find people . " " I find criminals . " " Your Aunt Mabel would be grateful if you 'd look for Fred , " my mother said . " Maybe you could just go over and talk to her and see what you think . " " She needs a detective , " I said . " I 'm not a detective . " " Mabel asked for you . She said she did n't want this going out of the family . " My internal radar dish started to hum . " Is there something you 're not telling me ? " " What 's to tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his car . " I drank my milk and rinsed the glass . " Okay , I 'll go talk to Aunt Mabel . But I 'm not promising anything . " Uncle Fred and Aunt Mabel live on Baker Street , on the fringe of the Burg , three blocks over from my parents . Their ten-year-old Pontiac station wagon was parked at the curb and just about spanned the length of their row house . They 've lived in the row house for as long as I can remember , raising two children , entertaining five grandchildren and annoying the hell out of each other for over fifty years . Aunt Mabel answered my knock on her door . She was a rounder , softer version of Grandma Mazur . Her white hair was perfectly permed . She was dressed in yellow polyester slacks and a matching floral blouse . Her earrings were large clip-ons , her lipstick was a bright red , and her eyebrows were brown crayon . " Well , is n't this nice , " Aunt Mabel said . " Come into the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the good kind , with the almonds . " Certain proprieties were observed in the Burg . No matter that your husband was kidnapped by aliens , visitors were offered coffee cake . I followed after Aunt Mabel and waited while she cut the cake . She poured out coffee and sat opposite me at the kitchen table . " I suppose your mother told you about your Uncle Fred , " she said . " Fifty-two years of marriage , and poof , he 's gone . " " Did Uncle Fred have any medical problems ? " " The man was healthy as a horse . " " How about his stroke ? " " Well , yes , but everybody has a stroke once in awhile . And that stroke did n't slow him down any . Most of the time he remembered things no one else would remember . Like that business with the garbage . Who would remember a thing like that ? Who would even care about it ? Such a fuss over nothing . " I knew I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the garbage ? " Mabel helped herself to a piece of coffee cake . " Last month there was a new driver on the garbage truck , and he skipped over our house . It only happened once , but would my husband forget a thing like that ? No . Fred never forgot anything . Especially if it had to do with money . So at the end of the month Fred wanted two dollars back on account of we pay quarterly , you see , and Fred had already paid for the missed day . " I nodded in understanding . This did n't surprise me at all . Some men played golf . Some men did crossword puzzles . Uncle Fred 's hobby was being cheap . " That was one of the things Fred was supposed to do on Friday , " Mabel said . " The garbage company was making him crazy . He went there in the morning , but the y would n't give him his money without proof that he 'd paid . Something about the computer messing up some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For two dollars . I did a mental head slap . If I 'd been the clerk Fred had talked to at the garbage company I 'd have given Fred two dollars out of my own pocket just to get rid of him . " What garbage company is this ? " " RGC . The police said Fred never got there . Fred had a whole list of errands he was going to do . He was going to the cleaners , the bank , the supermarket , and RGC . " " And you have n't heard from him . " " Not a word . Nobody 's heard anything . " I had a feeling there was n't going to be a happy ending to this story . " Do you have any idea where Fred might be ? " " Everyone thinks he just wandered away , like a big dummy . " " What do you think ? " Mabel did an up-and-down thing with her shoulders . Like she did n't know what to think . Whenever I did that , it meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If I show you something , you have to promise not to tell anyone , " Mabel said . Oh boy . She went to a kitchen drawer and took out a packet of pictures . " I found these in Fred 's desk . I was looking for the checkbook this morning , and this is what I found . " I stared at the first picture for at least thirty seconds before I realized what I was seeing . The print was taken in shadow and looked underexposed . The perimeter was a black plastic trash bag , and in the center of the photo was a bloody hand severed at the wrist . I thumbed through the rest of the pack . More of the same . In some the bag was spread wider , revealing more body parts . What looked l ike a shinbone , part of a torso maybe , something that might have been the back of the head . Hard to tell if it was man or woman . The shock of the pictures had me holding my breath , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want to ruin my bounty hunter image and keel over onto the floor , so I concentrated on quietly resuming breathing . " You have to give these to the police , " I said . Mabel gave her head a shake . " I do n't know what Fred was doing with these pictures . Why would a person have pictures like this ? " No date on the front or the back . " Do you know when they were taken ? " " No . This is the first I saw them . " " Do you mind if I look through Fred 's desk ? " " It 's in the cellar , " Mabel said . " Fred spent a lot of time down there . " It was a battered government-issue desk . Probably bought at a Fort Dix yard sale . It was positioned against the wall , opposite the washer and dryer . And it was set on a stained piece of wall to wall carpet that I assumed had been saved when new carpet was laid upstairs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pencils and pens . A drawer filled with instruction booklets and warranty cars for household appliances . Another drawer devoted to old issues of National Geographic . The magazines were dog-eared , and I could see Fred down here , escaping from Mabel , reading about the vanishing forests of Borneo . A cancelled RGC check had been carefully placed under a paperweight . Fred had probably made a copy to take with him and had left the original here . There are parts of the country where people trust banks to keep their checks and to simply forward computer-generated stateme nts each month . The Burg is n't one of those places . Residents of the Burg are n't that trusting of computers or banks . Residents of the Burg like paper . My relatives hoard cancelled checks like Scrooge McDuck hoards quarters . I did n't see any more photos of dead bodies . And I could n't find any notes or sales receipts that might be connected to the pictures . " You do n't suppose Fred killed this person , do you ? " Mabel asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew was that I was very creeped out . " Fred did n't seem like the sort of person to do something like this , " I told Mabel . " Would you like me to pass these on to the police for you ? " " If you think that 's the right thing to do . " Without a shadow of a doubt . I had phone calls to make , and my parents house was closer than my apartment and less expensive than using my cell phone , so I rumbled back to Roosevelt Street . " How 'd it go ? " grandma asked , rushing into the foyer to meet me . " It went okay . " " You gon na take the case ? " " It 's not a case . It 's a missing person . Sort of . " " You 're gon na have a devil of a time finding him if it was aliens , " Grandma said . I dialed the central dispatch number for the Trenton Police Department and asked for Eddie Gazarra . Gazarra and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cousin Shirley the Whiner . He was a good friend , a good cop and a good source for police information . " You need something , " Gazarra said . " Hello to you , too . " " Am I wrong ? " " No . I need some details on a recent investigation . " " I ca n't give you that kind of stuff . " " Of course you can , " I said . " Anyway , this is about Uncle Fred . " " The missing Uncle Fred ? " " That 's the one . " " What do you want to know ? " " Anything . " " Hold on . " He was back on the line a couple minutes later , and I could hear him leafing through papers . " It says here Fred was reported missing on Friday , which is technically too early for a missing person , but we always keep our eyes open anyway . Especially with old folks . Sometimes they 're out there wandering around , looking for the road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's doing ? Looking for Oz ? " " Hard to say . Fred 's car was found in the Grand Union parking lot . The car was locked up . No sign of forced entry . No sign of struggle . No sign of theft . There was dry cleaning laid out on the backseat . " " Anything else in the car ? Groceries ? " " Nope . No groceries . " " So he got to the dry cleaner but not the supermarket . " " I have a chronology of events here , " Gazarra said . " Fred left his house at one oclock , right after he ate lunch . Next stop that we know of was the bank , First Trenton Trust . Their records show he withdrew two hundred dollars from the automatic teller in the lobby at two thirty-five . The cleaner , next to Grand Union in the same strip mall , said Fred picked his cleaning up around two forty-five . And that 's all we have . " " There 's an hour missing . It takes ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Trenton . " " Do n't know , " Gazarra said . " He was supposed to go to RGC Waste Haulers , but RGC says he never showed up . " " Thanks , Eddie . " " If you want to return the favor , I could use a baby-sitter Saturday night . " Gazarra coul d always use a baby-sitter . His kids were cute but death on baby-sitters . " Gee Eddie , I 'd love to help you out , but Saturday 's a bad day . I promised somebody I 'd do something on Saturday . " " Yeah , right . " " Listen Gazarra , last time I baby-sat for your kids they cut two inches off my hair . " " You should n't have fallen asleep . What were you doing sleeping on the job , anyway ? " " It was one in the morning ! " My next call was to Joe Morelli . Joe Morelli is a plainclothes cop who has skills not covered in the policeman 's handbook . A couple months ago , I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago , I kicked him out . We 'd seen each other several times since then on chance encounters and arranged dinner dates . The chance encounters were always warm . The dinner dates took the temperature up a notch and more often than not involved loud talking , which I called a discussion and Morelli called a fight . None of these meetings had ended in the bedroom . When you grow up in the Burg there are several mantras little girls learn at an early age . One of them is that men do n't buy goods they can get for free . Those words of wisdom had n't stopped me from giving my goods away to Morelli , but they did stop me from continuing to give them away . That plus a false pregnancy scare . Although I have to admit , I had mixed feelings about not being pregnant . There was a smidgen of regret mixed with the relief . And probably it was the regret more than the relief that made me take a more serious look at my life and my relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see eye to eye on a lot of things . Not that we 'd entirely given up on the relation ship . It was more that we were in a holding pattern with each of us staking out territory ... not unlike the Arab-Israeli conflict . I tried Morelli 's home phone , office number , and car phone . No luck . I left messages everywhere and left my cell phone number on his pager . " Well what did you find out ? " Grandma wanted to know when I hung up . " Not much . Fred left the house at one , and a little over an hour later , he was at the bank and the cleaner . He must have done something in that time , but I do n't know what . " My mother and my grandmother looked at each other . " What ? " I asked . " What ? " " He was probably taking care of some personal business , " my mother said . " You do n't want to bother yourself with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of looks between my mother and grandmother . " There 's two kinds of secrets , " Grandma said . " One kind is where nobody knows the secret . And the other kind is where everybody knows the secret , but pretends not to know the secret . This is the second kind of secret . " " So ? " " It 's about his honeys , " Grandma said . " His honeys ? " " Fred always has a honey on the side , " Grandma said . " Should have been a politician . " " You mean Fred has affairs ? He 's in his seventies ! " " Midlife crises , " Grandma said . " Seventy is n't midlife , " I said . " Forty is midlife . " Grandma slid her uppers around some . " Guess it depends how long you intend to live . " I turned to my mother . " You knew about this ? " My mother took a couple deli bags of cold cuts out of the refrigerator and emptied them on a plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . I do n't know ho w Mabel 's put up with it . " " Booze , " Grandma said . I made myself a liverwurst sandwich and took it to the table . " Do you think Uncle Fred might have run off with one of his girlfriends ? " " More likely one of their husbands picked Fred up and drove him to the landfill , " Grandma said . " I ca n't see cheapskate Fred paying for the cleaning if he was going to run off with one of his floozies . " " You have any idea who he was seeing ? " " Hard to keep track , " Grandma said . She looked over at my mother . " What do you think , Ellen ? You think he 's still seeing Loretta Walenowski ? " " I heard that was over , " my mother said . My cell phone rang in my shoulder bag . " Hey Cupcake , " Morelli said . " What 's the disaster ? " " How do you know it 's a disaster ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pager . It 's either a disaster or you want me bad , and my luck has n't been that good today . " " I need to talk to you . " " Now ? " " It 'll only take a minute . " The skillet is a sandwich shop next to the hospital and could be better named the Grease Pit . Morelli got there ahead of me . He was standing , soda in hand , looking like the day was already too long . He smiled when he saw me . . . and it was the nice smile that included his eyes . He draped an arm around my neck , pulled me to him , and kissed me . " Just so my day is n't a complete waste , " he said . " We have a family problem . " " Uncle Fred ? " " Boy , you know everything . You should be a cop . " " Wiseass , " Morelli said . " What do you need ? " I handed him the packet of pictures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He shuff led through them . " Christ . What is this shit ? " " Looks like body parts . " He tapped me on the head with the stack of pictures . " Comedian . " " You have any ideas here ? " " They need to go to Arnie Mott , " Morelli said . " He 's in charge of the investigation . " " Arnie Mott has the initiative of a squash . " " Yeah . But he 's still in charge . I can pass them on for you . " " What does this mean ? " Joe shook his head , still studying the top photo . " I do n't know , but this looks real . " I made an illegal U-turn on Hamilton and parked just short of Vinnie 's office , docking the Buick behind a black Mercedes S600V , which I suspected belonged to Ranger . Ranger changed cars like other men changed socks . The only common denominatorwith Ranger 's cars was that they were always expensive and they were always black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door . " Was Briggs really only three feet tall ? " " Three feet tall and uncooperative . I should have read the physical description on his application for appearance bond before I knocked on his door . Do n't suppose anything else came in ? " " Sorry , " Connie said . " Nothing . " " This is turning into a real bummer of a day . My uncle Fred is missing . He went out to run errands on Friday , and that was the last anyone 's seen him . They found his car in the GrandUnion parking lot . " No need to mention the butchered body . " I had an uncle do that once , " Lula said . " He walked all the way to Perth Amboy before someone found him . It was one of them senior moments . " The door to the inner office was closed , and Ranger was nowhere to be seen , so I guessed he was talking to Vi nnie . I cut my eyes in that direction . " Ranger in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did some work for Vinnie . " " Work ? " " Do n't ask , " Connie said . " Not bounty hunter stuff . " " Not nearly . " I left the office and waited outside . Ranger appeared five minutes later . Ranger 's Cuban-American . His features are Anglo , his eyes are Latino , his skin is the color of a mocha latte , and his body is as good as a body can get . He had his black air pulled back into a ponytail . He was wearing a black T-shirt that fit him like a tattoo and black SWAT pants tucked into black high-top boots . " Yo , " I said . Ranger looked at me over the top of his shades . " Yo yourself . " I gazed longingly at his car . " Nice Mercedes . " " Transportation , " Ranger said . " Nothing fancy . " Compared to what ?

" " And I 've been thinking maybe I should diversify . " " And ? " " And I thought you might help me . " " You talking about building a portfolio ? Investing money ? " " No . I 'm talking about making money . " Ranger tipped his head back and laughed softly . " Babe , you do n't want to do that kind of diversifying . " I narrowed my eyes . " Okay , " he said .
