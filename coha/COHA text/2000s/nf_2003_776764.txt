Excerpt // Introduction : The Three-Fifths Clause // The election of Mr. Jefferson to the presidency was , upon sectional feelings , // the triumph of the South over the North  --  of the slave representation over the // purely free . //  --  John Quincy Adams // What did Thomas Jefferson " s Federalist critics mean , after 1800 , when they // called him the " Negro President " ? A person first encountering the term might , // in the not too distant past , have thought it referred to Jefferson " s private life at // Monticello . In those hagiographical days , calling him a " Negro president " // might have been interpreted to mean that he was a pro-Negro president , an // ami des noirs who sympathized with the plight of slaves , though he could not // do much about it . That was the line I heard when I first visited Monticello // more than forty years ago . More recently still , the term might be taken to // mean that he loved his own slave Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But those first calling him the " Negro President " were not prying into his // private life . They were challenging his public boast that the election of 1800 // was a " Second Revolution " based on the expressed will of a popular majority . // It was no such thing , they argued . In terms of the number of actual votes // cast , John Adams was re-elected . The Second Revolution never occurred . // Jefferson " s Election // If real votes alone had been counted , Adams would have been returned to // office . But , of course , the " vote " did not depend solely on voters . Though // Jefferson , admittedly , received eight more votes than Adams in the Electoral // College , at least twelve of his votes were not based on the citizenry that // could express its will but on the blacks owned by southern masters . A // bargain had been struck at the Constitutional Convention  --  one of the // famous compromises on which the document was formed , this one intended // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreed that // each slave held in the United States would count as three-fifths of a person  --  // the so-called federal ratio  --  for establishing the representation of a state in // the House of Representatives ( and consequently in the Electoral College , // which was based on the House and Senate numbers for each state in // Congress ) . // It galled the Federalists that Jefferson hailed his 1800 victory as a // triumph of democracy and majority rule when , as the Mercury and New- // England Palladium of Boston said ( January 20 , 1801 ) , he had made his " ride // into the temple of Liberty on the shoulders of slaves . " He was president only // because of " somber " or " sable " non-votes , and the Columbian Centinel noted // ( December 24 , 1800 ) that the half-million slaves affecting the outcome had no // more will in the matter than " New England horses , cows , and oxen . " Timothy // Pickering , the former secretary of state under Washington and Adams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it current among his Federalist // allies  --  along with references to Negro electors , Negro voters , and Negro // congressmen . Senator William Plumer of New Hampshire wrote that " the // Negro votes made Mr. Jefferson president . " He felt that " Negro electors // exceed those of four states , and their representatives are equal to those of // six states " ( PM 67 ) . // Even four years before the 1800 election , New Englanders had // feared that Jefferson might win on his first try for the presidency , but only // because of the " Negro electors . " Connecticut governor Oliver Wolcott said // then that the country would not submit to election " by a Negro representation // only , " and papers in his state predicted that such an event might prompt the // North to secede from the Union . When their fears were confirmed by the // outcome in 1800 , Pickering faced the 1804 contest with a dread premonition : // Without a separation , can those New England states ever rid themselves of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight in the // political balance ? At this moment , the slaves of the middle and southern // states have fifteen representatives in Congress , and they will appoint that // number of electors of the next president and vice president ; and the number // of slaves is continuously increasing . ( P 14.101 ) // The Federalists predicted that this Negro " representation " would // increase year by year so long as the federal ratio were retained . This // prospect is what they meant by " the slave power . " They did not mean the // power that plantation owners exerted over their black slaves , or the power // slaves might someday use in retaliation . They meant the power that slave // states wielded over non-slave states . The Federalists said that the plantation // men were their masters . As William Plumer wrote in a public appeal to his // New Hampshire constituents : // Every five of the Negro slaves are accounted equal to three of you . . . Those // slaves have no voice in the elections ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred of them may be considered as having sixty votes , // while one of you who has equal or greater property is confined to a single // vote . // Though the election of 1800 is one of the most thoroughly studied // events in our history , few treatments of it even mention the fact that Jefferson // won it by the slave count . It is called the first modern election , because // political parties contested it . People debate whether it earns Jefferson " s own // title for it , the " Second Revolution . " But Jefferson " s ascendancy is most // frequently hailed as a triumph for the stability of the young constitutional // system , since the incumbent was ousted without violence : " Above all , the // election demonstrated that control of the vast political power of the national // government could pass peacefully from one political party to another . " // The election is studied , as well , because it was deflected to the // House of Representatives for decision , since the two Republican candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Electoral College . That tie led to // one of the earliest constitutional readjustments after the adoption of the Bill of // Rights  --  the Twelfth Amendment , which established a separate vote for the // vice presidency . The election can also be treated as a clash between the // personalities of Jefferson and Burr , or between Jefferson and Adams . These // are all interesting aspects of the event . But they are not enough , in // themselves , to explain the odd neglect of the fact that this was an election // where the federal ratio made the margin of difference . // Two authors have written books on the election of 1800 without a // single reference to the votes given Jefferson by the slave bonus . A fine // symposium on the election , rated in its own pages as " the best new // scholarship on the politics of 1800 , " has in its sixteen major essays only // three glancing mentions of the federal ratio . Respected biographers of the // principals in the affair  --  Adams , Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost given Jefferson by the three- fifths clause , or they refer to it only // peripherally , as if it were unimportant . To judge by the mass of things written // on the election , Jefferson " s debt to the federal ratio must be one of the great // nonevents of our past . // Yet for Federalists the slave count was not a subsidiary concern ; // it was at the very core of sectional division in the country . Josiah Quincy , // who became the president of Harvard , always maintained that " the slave // representation is the cause of all the difficulties we labor under . " Fisher Ames // called it a flaw in the Constitution that , " instead of apportioning , // disproportions representatives to numbers of citizens . " For such men , the // ratio was even more pernicious in its consequences than the clauses in the // Constitution that recognized the legitimacy of the slave trade for the next // twenty years ( Article I , Section 9 ) or that imposed a fugitive slave law on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The federal ratio undermined the very possibility // of debating or changing the status of slaves  --  as the gag rules of the 1830s // and 1840s would demonstrate . It gave a key electoral tool for maintaining // slavery against a majority of white voters . The federal ratio was such an // irritant to the Federalists that one man " s gibe at Jefferson " s children by Sally // Hemings was seen as swelling the ratio . Five children by her would give him // three extra votes . // Great men can never lack supporters // Who manufacture their own voters . // Reach of the Three-Fifths Clause // Why is the impact of the federal ratio so little known ? The first reaction of // many people when told about its role in Jefferson " s election is to ask why // they never heard of it before . There are several explanations for this , all // contained within the fact that through much of our history Americans have // shied away from slavery as too divisive or hot an issue , leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More particularly , the force of // the three-fifths clause is neglected because it " only " affected one presidential // election , Jefferson " s  --  though Paul Finkelman suggests that it may have // deprived John Quincy Adams of a majority in the contested election of 1824. // The federal ratio is neglected , as well , because dire predictions of southern // majorities in the Congress never came true , even with the benefit of the slave // count , since immigration was heavier in the North during the early nineteenth // century . // But the power of the South was not measured solely in terms of // an overall majority . On crucial matters , when several factions were // contending , the federal ratio gave the South a voting majority . Without the // federal ratio as the deciding factor in House votes , slavery would have been // excluded from Missouri ( see Chapter 14 below ) , Jackson " s Indian removal // policy would have failed ( see Chapter 16 ) , the 1840 gag rule would not have // been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have banned slavery in // territories won from Mexico ( Chapter 16 ) , the Kansas-Nebraska Bill would // have failed ( Chapter 16 ) . Other votes were close enough to afford opposition to // the South a better chance , if the federal ratio had not been counted into the // calculations from the outset . Elections to key congressional posts were // affected continually by the federal ratio , with the result that southerners // held " the Speaker " s office for 79 percent of the time before 1824 , Ways and // Means for 92 percent . " // Leonard Richards shows another pervasive influence of the three- // fifths clause . Even when it did not affect the outcome of congressional votes , // it dominated Democratic caucus and convention votes , since the South had a // larger majority there than in the total body . The federal ratio guaranteed that // Democratic presidential nominations would be friendly to the slave interest . // When control of the caucus seemed to be slipping from southern hands , a // two-thirds requirement for nominating candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacceptable men . The federal ratio was , therefore , just the // starting point for seizing and solidifying positions of influence in the // government . It was a force supplemented by other maneuvers . It gave the // South a permanent head start for all its political activities . // The slave states always had one-third more seats in Congress than their free // population warranted  --  forty-seven seats instead of thirty-three in 1793 , // seventy-six instead of fifty-nine in 1812 , and ninety-eight instead of seventy- // three in 1833 . . . The Deep South also imported more slaves from Africa in // the twenty years from 1788 to 1808 ( the year the international slave trade // was legally banned ) than in any other twenty-year period . . . the three-fifths // rule would also play a decisive role in every political caucus and every // political convention . // The federal ratio , and its ripple of side effects , had a great deal to do with the // fact that for over half a century , right up to the Civil War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South . // In the sixty-two years between Washington " s election and the Compromise of // 1850 , for example , slaveholders controlled the presidency for fifty years , the // Speaker " s chair for forty-one years , and the chairmanship of House Ways // and Means the most important committee for forty-two years . The only men // to be reelected president  --  Washington , Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , and // Jackson  --  were all slaveholders . The men who sat in the Speaker " s chair // the longest  --  Henry Clay , Andrew Stevenson , and Nathaniel Macon  --  were // slaveholders . Eighteen out of thirty-one Supreme Court justices were // slaveholders. // Seven justices delivered the majority opinion in the Dred Scott decision , and // a majority of them were slaveholders . The lower courts , too , were stocked // with pro-slavery men . Jefferson came into office complaining about a federal // judiciary unbalanced in favor of Federalists ; but that balance shifted to the // other extreme over the next decades . // Richard H. Brown states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil War , the South was in the saddle of national // politics . This is the central fact in American political history to 1860 . " Ten of // the pre-Civil War presidents were slave owners themselves , and two of the // postwar presidents had owned slaves earlier  --  Johnson and Grant . That // means that over a quarter of the presidents in our history were slaveholders. // Even those who were not southerners had to temporize with the South . // Northerners or westerners like Van Buren , Tyler , Polk , Clay , and Buchanan // helped craft the gag laws protecting slavery in the District of Columbia ( see // Chapter 16 below ) . Tyler added a slave Texas , and Polk waged the war for // slave territory taken from Mexico . It was a northerner who constructed the // North-South alliance that protected slavery for decades : " Many scholars have // long suspected that Van Buren and his colleagues purposely fashioned the // Jackson coalition so that it protected slavery and southern interests . " // Buchanan worked behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Quincy Adams had to settle for a southern cabinet , led by the slaveholding // Clay , to deal with a Jacksonian Congress . //
