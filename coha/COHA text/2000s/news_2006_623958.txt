<p> California 's Proposition 71 program was intended to create a $3 billion West Coast counterpart to the National Institutes of Health empowered to go where the NIH could not : full steam into the new field of biomedical research centered on human embryonic stem cells . <p> Instead , the program has gotten stuck in a seemingly endless legal morass . Although state officials say they are optimistic about their chances in court , it 's expected that the program will take at least 15 more months to slog through appeals and start issuing the first major grants . Meanwhile , revelations of faked cloning research in South Korea have set back the scientific agenda and scandalized the entire stem cell field . <p> Rather than ramping up a bold , $350 million annual grant-making operation , the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine appears to be entering a new era of declining expectations one year into its intended 10-year lifespan . <p> Universities have had to put construction plans on extended hold because of Prop . 71 's slow start , while researchers seek other sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nation 's main font of medical research grants , the NIH , is implementing cutbacks after its first budget reduction since 1970 . <p> And because of the Bush administration ban on grants for research on early-stage human embryos , the NIH is n't even an option for scientists working with most human embryonic stem cells . <p> " It 's certainly a really stressful time for researchers right now , and in the next few years it 's going to be worse . So it 's a very bad climate to start building programs and trying to get people excited about new things , " said Dr. Arnold Kriegstein , a neurologist who heads a stem cell research program being established at UCSF . <p> When Robert Klein , mastermind of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine , put his considerable force behind Prop . 71 , he called it a once-in-a-lifetime chance to " impact human suffering in a really fundamental way . " <p> That 's why he sought enough financial resources and independent decision-making to get the stem cell field going  --  stepping foursquare into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . <p> Now , the state effort is a magnet for attacks . Research advocates in other states view Prop . 71 not as a model to emulate , but as one to avoid . <p> In the lawsuits , stem cell research opponents and taxpayer advocates question whether the program was set up with too much independence from elected decisionmakers . A trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 27 before Alameda County Superior Court Judge Bonnie Sabraw in Hayward , but appeals will extend the delay even if the institute prevails . <p> Instead of financing an accelerating research agenda this year , officials are reduced to begging for handouts to avert closing down by June , when existing funds run out . They also implemented a freeze on most staff hiring . <p> The fundraising effort aims to generate $50 million  --  about $30 million has been promised already  --  far short of the $350 million peak annual spending envisioned by Prop . 71 . <p> Zach Hall , chief executive of the stem cell institute , said that $50 million will be enough to finance little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12.1 million training initiative for budding researchers . A separate plan calls for small " seed grants " for innovative projects at nonprofit centers . <p> Beyond that , officials are planning a conference in May on the safety of human-egg extraction , and they want to sponsor 16 California researchers who 've been invited to Britain to discuss collaborative efforts . The California institute also wants to convene a meeting of stem cell scientists from around the state in September . <p> But there 's no money yet for any of that . It will take about $2.5 million in additional donations , Hall said , for the institute to " remain active , remain visible and build the infrastructure on which we will launch this big program in the spring of ' 07 . " <p> Stem cell advocates in other states are moving with extraordinary caution to set up their own programs . <p> In Missouri , for instance , a ballot proposal aimed at the fall election does n't even call for public money for research grants . It simply seeks to allow stem cell research in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Legislative leaders in New Jersey have delayed stem-cell-friendly bills citing fears that Prop . 71 may be the wrong approach . <p> In California , leaders of the Prop . 71 program concede that the agonizingly slow startup will have a lingering impact . <p> " The prevailing opinion is we will prevail , it 's just a matter of when , " said Susan Bryant , dean of the UC Irvine School of Biological Sciences , who serves as a member of the stem cell institute 's governing board . <p> UC Irvine has drawn up detailed plans for a $60 million stem cell research facility big enough to house about 20 laboratories . Those plans have been shelved until Prop . 71 grants can be sought . Instead , UC Irvine is making do with rented space for a half-dozen labs in a university research park . <p> UCSF is renovating one floor of a research building at its Parnassus campus , using space opened up by the relocation of other laboratories to UCSF 's Mission Bay campus . <p> Kriegstein said " that is n't a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The university is in the early stages of planning its own , much grander , edifice devoted to stem cell science , but that , too , awaits Prop . 71 support . <p> Claims made during the 2004 campaign to get Prop . 71 approved made it seem that cures from the technology were imminent . No more . <p> " Expectations for this research are fine as long as people understand it could be a long time , " Bryant said . " It will never happen if we never get started . ... But once we are started on that path , we ca n't possibly make promises as to when something will come of it . " <p> Stem cell advocates like to remind skeptics that the first human embryonic cell lines were established only in 1998 . Despite the Prop . 71 snags , some talented young researchers have begun moving into California from out of state to join new or expanding stem cell programs . <p> UCSF 's Kriegstein , for instance , has recruited Dr. Holger Willenbring , a specialist on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who came to UCSF from Oregon ; Dr. Robert Blelloch , who focuses on the biochemical signals in cancer and stem cell biology , and who just relocated from the lab of MIT cloning pioneer Dr. Rudy Jaenisch ; and Dr. David Henry Rowitch , a pediatric oncologist arriving from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School . <p> UCSF also convinced Emmanuelle Passegu , who researched blood-forming stem cells in the lab of Dr. Irving Weissman , Stanford 's top stem cell scientist , to move from Palo Alto into her own lab in San Francisco , skipping East Coast opportunities . <p> Still , pessimism about Prop . 71 is clearly spreading . <p> In a recent analysis of the state institute 's startup troubles , Roger Noll , a leading Stanford economist , concluded that the state stem cell program " is unlikely to be a major force in biomedical research " and almost certainly wo n't generate any significant financial windfalls for California . <p> Any " dramatic therapeutic advances " would require " substantial additional research financed by others , " Noll observed , diluting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The state 's main advantage was filling the void created by the anti-stem-cell-research policies of the Bush administration . Most expect those restrictions will be eased , however , soon after Bush leaves office , if not sooner . <p> " It 's much harder to argue that there 's a useful role for ( the California institute ) if there are no restrictions on the NIH , " Noll said , suggesting it would then make more sense for California taxpayers to finance a much broader array of science and engineering projects , rather than try to single out one controversial branch of biomedicine . <p> That would be fine with people like Dana Cody , executive director of Life Legal Defense Foundation in Sacramento , which is backing the anti-Prop. 71 litigation . <p> " They have been trying to move just too fast , and they are doing it with taxpayer money , " she said . " There should be all sorts of protective measures to protect the taxpayer , and that 's the key problem with Prop . 71 : There is n't anything to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most stem cell researchers expect that Prop . 71 money will be forthcoming eventually , citing the legal hurdles faced by the opponents . <p> " I have every reason to be optimistic , " said Dr. Robert Mahley , president of the J. David Gladstone Institutes , a UCSF affiliate that also is moving ahead on stem cell research . <p> Still , Cody makes it clear the debate wo n't end anytime soon . <p> " They can continue to make predictions , " she said . " But if we lose at trial , we will appeal , and if we lose on appeal , we will go to the California Supreme Court . " <p> Some suggest the long pause may not be such a bad thing . <p> " The expectations have started to be lowered , but I think expectations were raised beyond justification , " said Jesse Reynolds of the Center for Genetics and Society in Oakland , which supports stem cell research but opposed Prop . 71 . <p> " It 's important , " he said , " to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell research <p>  --  A Missouri stem cell voter initiative is almost certain to qualify for the November ballot in that state . Basically , it would avoid California 's controversies by promising zero taxpayer funding , and it seeks to stop Missouri from passing laws that are more restrictive than federal regulations .
