<p> They have homes in Beverly Hills with Porsches in the driveway and Porthault linens on the bed . <p> So what 's left for a Hollywood celebrity to buy these days ? Rare books . Yes , rare books . <p> Often given as gifts , from director to actor or from agent to client , rare books are among the hottest items to give , get and collect in Hollywood . <p> On Friday , more than 180 rare-book sellers from around the world will bring their finest volumes to Los Angeles for the California International Antiquarian Book Fair , hoping to cash in on the trend . The film industry 's appetite for first editions has made Hollywood a global capital for selling and collecting treasured tomes . <p> The show runs through Sunday at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott Hotel , and the hip movie crowd is expected to be cruising the booths , searching for everything from Shakespeare to Salinger . <p> Not that rare-book collecting has n't happened in Hollywood before . Legendary director George Cukor , for instance , had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in the last few years , " says William Dailey of Dailey Rare Books on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles . " Years ago , we dealt with old collectors , older men who had collected for 30 years . Now it 's a new market . A lot of the people are involved in Hollywood and the film industry . " <p> Not that all of them actually read the books , mind you . Dailey says a great many of his sales are gifts . <p> " One good reason that old books make great gifts is because they 're about something that most people are familiar with and they have the cachet of intellectual knowledge . " <p> Lee Biondi , manager of the Heritage Book Shop , also on Melrose , is a bit more politic , mainly because the Hollywood crowd is his clientele . <p> " The creative community here is always going to want to be surrounded by literature and art , " Biondi says . " It 's a natural sidebar to their life . " <p> Maybe , but some think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . <p> " The L.A. crowd is unique . They tend to go with fads , " says Sanford Smith , manager of the New York International Antiquarian Book Fair , running April 13-16 at the Park Avenue Armory . <p> David Masello , who often writes about books for Art &; Antiques , has another theory . <p> " Maybe they 're going back to literature , which is wonderful , I guess . The scripts are so bad these days , suddenly it makes sense to be pillaging from the past . Good books are the antithesis of what Hollywood movies are . They have strong plot lines , developed characters , so maybe it 's just a reaction to that . You know , ' Here 's how it 's supposed to be , but here 's how our movie came out ! ' Things just got lost in the translation . " <p> The collecting , as well as giving , of rare books has grown by leaps and bounds for three reasons : a booming economy ; the fact rare books are a lot cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Internet , where many sites ( icollector.com , Alibris.com , Bibliofind . com ) allow millions to peruse and buy rare books . <p> But only in Tinseltown , a city filled with interior decorators who buy books by the yard and often for the color of their bindings  --  it 's called " smart art "  --  can a mint-condition first-edition Hemingway end up in the hands of a starlet who has never read a word he wrote . <p> But that 's not being completely fair . Whoopi Goldberg , for instance , is both a voracious reader and a longtime collector of rare books . <p> She , Jay Leno , Brad Pitt and superagent Michael Ovitz are but four of the high-profile Hollywood clients who frequent Biondi 's shop . Sarah Michelle Gellar , Michael Richards and John Larroquette also make the rounds of rare-book stores . <p> Goldberg " collects science fiction and horror and ghosts and some African-Americana , " Biondi says . " She has general , wide-ranging interests . <p> " Brad , on the other hand , is more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Very nice . " <p> Actress Winona Ryder collects first-edition J.D. Salingers . She tells In Style magazine this month that she has every edition and translation of The Catcher in the Rye . <p> Why ? Living in the computer age , she says , she 's terrified " we 're never going to have human contact ever again . I love the idea of touching the paper , feeling the texture of it . It 's so much more romantic . " <p> Actor Michael Lerner understands . He thinks books are " sexy . " <p> Not one of the new breed , Lerner has collected books for 30 years and is just completing his British series of A &C; Black books of color geographic illustrations , books too costly to produce today . <p> " There 's a wonderful sense of history about them . The illustrations almost look like watercolors , " he says . " Plus , it 's a great adventure .

" <p> But these days the rare book is just handed to the Hollywood celeb , often a gift tied to a project or production . When Shakespeare in Love was being filmed , for instance , works by the Bard were in demand . <p> Dan Adams of Waverly Books in Santa Monica says it 's not uncommon for a production company to seek out numerous volumes of a certain book to give to the cast . <p> Most recently , he supplied some first-edition copies of David Guterson 's best-selling Snow Falling on Cedars , now a feature film . A first edition goes for between $ 100 and $ 200 . <p> " This whole thing , this new interest in rare books with the Hollywood crowd , is becoming much trendier , but the writers and producers have been doing it for a while , " says Craig Graham of Vagabond Books in L.A. 's Brentwood neighborhood . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The in-demand authors remain the great American writers of the 20th century : Ernest Hemingway , F. Scott Fitzgerald , John Steinbeck , William Faulkner . <p> But sometimes much newer works command a good price . A major motion picture based on a book can affect the price . When the Oscar-winning Forrest Gump was in movie theaters in 1994 , the 1986 book by Winston Groom was selling for $ 300 . It is worth about half that now . <p> Some young celebrities are putting together their own libraries , often with the help of local book dealers . <p> " Johnny Depp  --  he 's the type of person who wanted to assemble a library all his life , even before he hit it big , " Biondi says . " He 's very interested in the Beats  --  Kerouac , Ginsberg , Burroughs . His spending level has gone way up , but his passion has always been there . " <p> What price are we talking here ? Celebrities wo n't find much at L.A. 's rare-book stores for $ 100 . A more realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price can soar into the millions . <p> Dealers say the new collectors are focusing on post-World War II literature , often Catcher and To Kill a Mockingbird . A first edition of Catcher could bring $ 12,000 . <p> Gordon Hollis , owner of the Golden Legend bookstore on Sunset Boulevard , is n't thrilled about this rare-book-as-gift trend . <p> " Personally ? I think it 's a servile and disgusting thing , " says Hollis , only half-kidding . " This trend in giving away first editions of authors , it 's a ' 60s-generation kind of thing . I 'll do it if I have it . I 'll sell it . But that 's not why I 'm in the business . " <p> Hollis thinks it 's just a sign of the good times all around us . <p> " My dire prediction is that this is all going to stop when the economy stops . The backbone of the rare-book business has always been the research library and the serious collector , and it will return to that . Mark my words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't so sure . <p> " It was d&eacute;class&eacute; to show your wealth off three or four years ago , but they got over that quickly . This will continue . "
