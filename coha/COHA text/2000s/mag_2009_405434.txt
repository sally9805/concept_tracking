In this tale of an old grouch and a Southern belle , Woody Allen hatches his freshest film in ages . " On the whole , I 'm sorry to say , we 're a failed species . " Thus pronounceth Boris Yellnikoff ( Larry David ) , a quantum physicist by trade and a raging grouch by temperament . " I 'm a man with a huge worldview , " this self-proclaimed genius says . " I 'm surrounded by microbes . " In his 60s , with a research career , an ex-wife and a failed suicide attempt on his rsum , Boris teaches chess to kids , whom he insults mercilessly . His few friends indulge his rants but think he 's a little nuts , in part because he 's the only one who realizes he 's in a film . He stares out at the audience , whom he 's not too crazy about either , and warns us , " This is not the feel-good movie of the year . So if you 're one of those idiots who needs to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boris is the king of pessimists , but into each reign some life must fall . It comes in the pretty package of Melody St. Ann Celestine ( Evan Rachel Wood ) , who might be as old as 20 and who 's run away from her Mississippi family to end up homeless in Manhattan . She talks her way into a stay in Boris ' place , and in a trice , she has kind of a crush on him . They get married , and ... Not again , we hear you groaning . Another Woody Allen movie that propagandizes crabby old guys attracting cute young women . This is not a comedy scenario ; it 's a criminal offense , right ? Except that in Whatever Works , Allen has taken his usual ingredients -- mismatched pairings , the collision of the bitter and the sweet , an abiding love for Dixieland jazz , classic Hollywood movies and his hometown -- and somehow made his freshest film in ages . After four pictures abroad , two of which ( Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona ) were pretty good , the 73-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings . Melody 's perky nature rubs off on Boris and on the entire enterprise . No kidding : this is the feel-good movie of the year and a cinematic soul massage . A lot of the fun comes from Boris ' splenetic vigor : his misery is good company . He 's an artist of invective -- and in this year 's movie gallery of mean old men , a chattier cousin of the widower in Pixar 's Up . Credit Boris ' vitality to David , resident curmudgeon on HBO 's Curb Your Enthusiasm . Boris is n't far from roles Allen has written for himself , yet sentiments that sound whiny when Allen articulates them have a robust manliness in David 's voice . Rancor is the medicine that keeps Boris alive . It makes him the ideal foil for Melody 's cheerful resilience ( which Wood winningly captures ) and gives him a tart appeal , even when he 's condemning the universe as " this cruel , dog-eat-dog , pointless black chaos " and his own film audience as " Neanderthals "  - -  or when he observes that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still ca n't get a cab in New York . " Like Molire , Allen and David know there are few spectacles droller than a misanthrope in full fester . Whatever Works also owes a debt to The Wizard of Oz . Melody is Dorothy , Boris is the fulminating old wizard , and Oz -- well , that has to be Manhattan : Gotham as the Emerald City , full of endearing creatures who make dreams come true . The town has a magical effect on its visitors . Melody picks up some of Boris ' dour rhetoric , except that for cretins she says " croutons . " Her parents , having followed her trail north , get the feeling too . Her staid father ( Ed Begley Jr. ) unbuttons his sexual inhibitions , and her Blanche DuBois -- like mom ( a stingingly funny Patricia Clarkson ) becomes a noted photographer and full-time free spirit . Allen unabashedly loved the city in its grimy , dangerous years ; his 1979 Manhattan opened with fireworks over Central Park , to the strains of Gershwin 's Rhapsody in Blue . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today the city is spiffier , and Boris is mired in ' 70s disgust . But Allen is n't ; he 's a tour guide to local attractions , from the Statue of Liberty to Madame Tussauds on the Disneyfied 42nd Street . It 's a vision of New York City as the welcomer and transformer of all lost souls , possibly including Boris the grouse . And if you were wondering , the marriage of Boris and Melody is meant as a demonstration that opposites may attract , but they do n't last . Taking a cue from Smiles of a Summer Night , one of Allen 's favorite Ingmar Bergman films , Whatever Works liberates its characters from their conventional domestic alliances and finds new lovers : like with like , youth with youth , man with surprisingly congenial woman or man . This movie , though , is more than the sum of the films it echoes , including Allen 's own . It 's common for reviewers of his recent work to cite an early triumph like Bananas or Annie Hall and find the new ones lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fizz with a mature comic romanticism ; it 's been aged in wit . If Allen has a decade or two of films left in him and if he makes a really excellent one years from now , people will say , " It 's terrific , but it 's no Whatever Works . " PULLQUOTE A lot of the fun comes from Boris ' splenetic vigor . He 's an artist of invective ; his misery is good company
