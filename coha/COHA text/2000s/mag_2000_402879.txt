How the discovery of a long-forgotten trunk inspired an artist to spend years recording the quiet remnants of a wrenching military career . <p> My grandfather spoke to me about his experiences in the first World War only once , and that was abruptly and in anger . As young boys , my brothers and I would spend part of our summer vacations with my grandparents . One sweltering August night I climbed down from the attic guest room to ask my grandmother if I could sleep on the screened porch . She helped me gather up my pillows and sheets , and as we were rounding the second-story landing , my grandfather appeared unexpectedly . " What are you doing ? " he demanded of my grandmother , who explained that I was going down to the porch , where it would be more comfortable . " Comfortable ? " he snapped , wheeling on me now . " Comfortable ? Do you know , boy , that when I was in France , we slept on rocks , and I never once complained . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disgust . I stood there mute and uncomprehending , not knowing what France was or what I had done . I did not think of his outburst again for almost forty years , and it is only now that I am able to understand it . <p> I am a painter in large part because of my grandfather , Edward H. Freedman . His enlistment record states his vocation as " artist , " but by the time I knew him , he had pretty much given up fine art and resigned himself to being an illustrator and art teacher to support his family . He was a perpetual instructor , always willing to sit down and show me how to draw something . I remember with absolute clarity the feeling of entering his studio , smelling the turpentine , and seeing the dizzying array of colors in his paint box . <p> A few years ago , I had cause to think of that childhood encounter when , going through a trunk in my parents ' attic , I discovered a tattered miniature book that turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . As I was growing up , I pieced together that he had fought with Pershing 's American Expeditionary Force , but he never spoke to anyone of his experiences . His witnessing of the horrors of trench warfare , his grueling labor in the 52d Pioneer Infantry , marching through the moonscape that was eastern France , filling in shell holes and burying horses and mules , the death of his beloved older brother , Isaac  --  these things were unknown to me until I happened upon that small book . <p> His journal had to be small ; it was competing for very valuable real estate in his knapsack . He gave it a title , " The Great War and Me . " Severely dog-eared and yellowed , it began to disintegrate the instant I touched it . I worked with the greatest care to separate its Bible-thin pages , cemented together by rain and mud . <p> The journal turned out to be only part of what I found . There was a beautiful Waltham wristwatch that had belonged to my great-uncle Isaac , nicknamed Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 77th Division of the 307th Infantry , part of the group that finally reached the " Lost " Battalion in the Argonne Forest . Ike had been killed less than a month before the war 's end , in some of the worst fighting in the Argonne . I wound up the timepiece , a present to my great-uncle from a neighbor when he was drafted into the Army , but it remained silent . <p> I also pulled out of the trunk some military paraphernalia and a great mass of papers and documents : letters , sketches , official papers , and several issues of " The CheerUp , " a family newsletter meant to connect the folks at home to the seven extended family members serving in the Army in 1918 . Among all these items , two stood out . The first was a pencil drawing my grandfather had made of a copse of trees overlooking the spot where Ike was killed . The second was an exquisitely drawn map showing the exact location of Ike 's field grave in the forest , just outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 21 , ten days after the armistice , and he clearly wanted to be able to find the spot again . By drawing the slope of the hill , a line of sight to a far-off church tower , and the position of the shadow of his pencil point at a specific time of day , he managed to fix the location of Ike 's grave so accurately that my wife and daughters and I were able to find the spot some eighty years later . <p> My grandfather was no Wilfred Owen . When you read British soldiers ' letters and diaries from the Western Front , you get the feeling that they must have had some sort of poetry prerequisite at their enlistment offices . My grandfather , on the other hand , came from that generation of American men who could use the words gumption and backbone in the same sentence . He was not given to musing on larger questions , either political or existential , but he did occasionally stop to record how something made him feel , as in this description of Rosh Hashanah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old French men present ( no young ones excepting a few children ) and about twenty young and old women . The remainder consisted of soldiers &; there were many among them who were wounded &; who were detailed to guard prisoners . The services started at 9 and they were very much the same as those held at home . <p> " And I began to think that several hours later the folks at home would all be gathered in a synagogue praying and weeping for their dear ones over here  --  a few tears came to my eyes  --  and I remembered that I was a soldier and must show no weakness . Very soon the tears disappeared  --  and while they lifted the Saiftorahs from their cozy berths of velvet I prayed for Ike that he come home untouched , healthy and happy ; I prayed for the rest of the boys , and I prayed for the folks at home that they might all be well and happy &; see their dear ones return  --  I prayed for victory soon &; I prayed that the Lord take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journal tells is of the bond between my grandfather and his brother . Both Edward 's diary and Ike 's letters are full of the frustration of these two men , serving sometimes only a few miles apart , at being unable to see each other or even communicate by mail . One obstacle was the Army censors , who did not allow them to reveal their exact locations . Ike wrote on September 18 , 1918 : <p> My Dear Ed , <p> I just came out of the lines after doing 17 days of the most strenuous possible , but am glad to say I am O.K. physically for which I am thankful indeed and very fortunate . Our division had a pretty rough go of it but made quite a good advance , though they paid the price for it . ... <p> Ed , try and let me know where you are located . Ask your Lieutenant about it if you want to and explain it to him . I will try to get a ten day furlough after I get out of the lines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you if I have to hike it . I would give 500 of my francs for an hour 's talk with you . I think he will give you permission to let me know where you are located . Are you near Nordesque ? Answer yes or no . Your loving brother , Ike <p> <p> Within a month Ike was dead , killed on October 14 , 1918 . Because of mail delays , Ed did not find out until November 19 , more than a week after the war 's end . When peace was declared , he wrote : <p> " Hooray ! Hooray ! Hooray ! Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! Flash ! Bang ! The report , shots &; colored flashes come from the Front announcing that peace has been declared . The fellows are going nutty . They 're shooting their revolvers at the ceiling while the locomotives are tooting their whistles . The sky is one mass of colors . But somehow , I ca n't feel happy  --  I have n't heard from Ike since his letter of Oct 2nd . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inscribed in bright red ink : " God almighty ! I just heard that Ike was killed by shrapnel . The 307th Infantry just came into town &; I spoke to one of the men of the Machine Gun Unit &; he told me the news . Poor mother  --  poor dad  --  everybody at home  --  if only I could be home to cheer ' em up a bit . God preserve them in good health that I may see them all when I get back . Who knows what kind of burial he had  --  what place he lies in  --  I 've seen some terrible sights and I hope he looked like none of them . All along I 've prayed to the Lord to take me if one of us had to go . " <p> Within forty-eight hours he had secured a pass and went to Grandpre to find the grave . <p> Lt. Oliver provided me with a map on which corporal Hartley had indicated the location of the grave as best he could . Well , we hunted for a cross road that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards . We found similies but never the right . We went all the way down to Malhassee Ferm &; then started north again on another road . We finally reached Grandpre again about 4 P.M. without any success . I need n't mention my disappointment . " <p> The next morning , with a more detailed map and a guide , Jack , from Ike 's division , he set out again . <p> " After quite some walk we came upon the spot where the Boches got Ike . The line of dugouts  --  Ike 's dugout &; Jack 's ; the presumed shell hole &; the place where Ike fell . I made a rough sketch of the place &; a position map . <p> " We then hiked around again for quite a while , for Jack lost his bearings &; later regained them &; came upon the grave . It is situated on a hill side all alone in a section where no one will disturb it for there are no houses around . ... The boys left me . I stood alone with my hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my book of hymns &; said three . Then I said the Kaddish in the absence of my folks . " <p> It was the makeshift quality of Ike 's burial and the difficulty in finding the gravesite that prompted my grandfather to make detailed drawings of the two sites . If the purpose of drawing is to convey thought and emotion , then I do not know anything more moving than these two works , drawn to try to hold on to his dead brother . I have these maps pinned to my studio wall today . <p> My grandfather slept on rocks . I keep his journal by me because it speaks to me of courage and fortitude and , like my way of painting , ties me to my ancestors . One day , during the three years I spent working on a series of still-life paintings of the contents of my grandfather 's trunk , I took Ike 's watch and tapped it gently on the edge of the table . All of a sudden it started , stunned out of its coma . I felt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to life objects and experiences that had remained stored away for many years . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : In this still life , Edward Freedman 's tiny journal is at the center of a composition of gas mask , mess kit , helmet and watch . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Among Freedman 's effects were two sketches of his fellow soldiers , top and above .
