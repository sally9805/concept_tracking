Ireland is a land of poets and legends , of dreamers and rebels . All of these have music woven through and around them . Tunes for dancing or for weeping , for battle or for love . In ancient times , the harpists would travel from place to place , playing their tunes for a meal and a bed and the loose coins that might come with them . The harpists and the storytellerswere welcome where they wandered , be it cottage or inn or campfire . Their gift was carried inside them , and was valued even in the faerie rafts beneath the green hills . And so it is still . Once , not so long ago , a storyteller came to a quiet village by the sea and was made welcome . There , she found her heart and her home . A harpist lived among them , and had his home where he was content . But he had yet to find his heart . There was music playing in his head . Sometimes it came to him soft and dreamy , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shout and a laugh . An old friend calling you into the pub to stand you for a pint . It could be sweet or fierce or full of desperate tears . But it was music that ran through his mind . And it was his pleasure to hear it . Shawn Gallagher was a man comfortable with his life . Now there were some who would say he was comfortable because he rarely came out of his dreaming to see what was happening in the world . He did n't mind agreeing with them . His world was his music and his family , his home and the friends who counted . Why should he be bothered overmuch beyond that ? His family had lived in the village of Ardmore in the county of Waterford , in the country of Ireland for generations . Andthere the Gallaghers had run their pub , offering pints and glasses , a decent meal and a fine place for conversation as long as most cared to remember . Since his parents had settled in Boston sometime before , it was up to Shawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was more than fine with Shawn Gallagher , as he did n't quibble to admit he had no head for business whatsoever , or the desire to get one . He was happy enough to man the kitchen , for cooking relaxed him . The music would play for him , out in the pub or inside his head , as he filled orders or tweaked the menu of the day . Of course , there were times when his sister , Darcywho had more than her share of the family energy and ambitionwould come in where he was working up a stew or building some sandwiches and start a row . But that only livened things up . He had no problem lending a hand with the serving , especially if there was a bit of music or dancing going on . And he cleaned up without complaint after closing , for the Gallaghers ran a tidy place . Life in Ardmore suited himthe slow pace of it , the sweep of sea and cliff , the roll of green hills that went shimmering toward shadowed mountains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him , and Shawn was well rooted in Ardmore 's sandy soil . He had no desire to travel as his brother , Aidan , had done , or as Darcy spoke of doing . All that he needed was right at his fingertips . He saw no point in changing his view . Though he supposed he had , in a way . All of his life he 'd looked out his bedroom window toward the sea . It had been there , just there , foaming against the sand , dotted with boats , rough or calm and every mood in between . The scent of it was the first thing he 'd breathe in as he leaned out his window in the morning . But when his brother had married the pretty Yank Jude Frances Murray the previous fall , it seemed right to make a few adjustments . In the Gallagher way , the first to marry took over the family home . And so Jude and Aidan had moved into the rambling house at the edge of the village when they returned from honeymooning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pub and the little cottage that belonged to the Fitzgerald side of Jude 's family , Darcy had decided in favor of the rooms . She 'd browbeaten Shawn , and whoever else she could twist around her beautiful finger , into painting and hauling until she 'd turned Aidan 's once sparse rooms into her own little palace . That was fine with Shawn . He preferred the little cottage on the faerie hill with its view of the cliffs and the gardens , and its blessed quiet . Nor did he mind the ghost who walked there . He 'd yet to see her , but he knew she was there . Lady Gwen , who wept for the faerie lover she had castaway and waited for the spell to run its course and free them both . Shawn knew the story of the young maid who 'd lived three hundred years before in that very same cottage on that very same hill . Carrick , prince of the faeries , had fallen in love with her , but instead of giving her the words , offering his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would give her . Three times he brought her a silver bag of jewels , first diamonds cast from the fire of the sun , then pearls formed from tears dripped from the moon , and finally sapphires wrung from the heart of the sea . But doubting his heart , and her own destiny , she refused him . And the jewels he poured at her feet , so legend had it , became the very flowers that thrived in the door yard of the cottage . Most of the flowers slept now , Shawn thought , bedded down as winter blew over the coast . The cliffs where it was said the lady often walked were stark and barren under a brooding sky . A storm was biding its time , waiting to happen . The morning was a raw one , with the wind knocking at the windows and sneaking in to chill the cottage . He had a fire going in the kitchen hearth and his tea was hot , so he did n't mind the wind . He liked the arrogant music it made while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toying with the lyrics for a tune he 'd written . He did n't have to be at the pub for an hour yet . But to make sure he got there at all , he 'd set the timer on the stove and , as a backup , the alarm clock in his bedroom . With no one there to shake him out of his dreams and tell him to get his ass moving , he tended to forget the time altogether . Since it irritated Aidan when he was late , and gave Darcy an excuse to hammer at him , he did his best to stay on schedule . The trouble was , when he was deep enough in his music , the buzzing and beeping of the timers did n't register and he was late in any case . He was swimming in it now , in a song of love that was young and sure of itself . The sort , to Shawn 's thinking , that was as fickle as the wind but fun while it lasted . A dancing tune , he decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would try it out at the pub sometime , once it was polished a bit , and if he could convince Darcy to sing it . Her voice was just right for the mood of it . Too comfortable to bother going into the parlor where he 'd jammed the old piano he bought when he moved in , he tapped his foot for rhythm and refined the lyrics . He did n't hear the banging at the front door , the clomp of boot steps down the hallway , or the muttered curse . Typical , Brenna thought . Lost in some dream world again while life went on around him . She did n't know why she 'd bothered to knock in the first place-he rarely heard it , and they 'd been running tame in each other 's houses since childhood . Well , they were n't children anymore , and she 'd as soon knock as walk in on something she should n't . He could have had a woman inhere , for all she knew . The man attracted them like sugar water attracted bees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be . God , he was pretty . The errant thought popped into her head , and she immediately hated herself for it . But it was hard not to notice , after all . All that fine black hair looking just a bit shabby , as he never remembered when it was time for a trim . Eyes of a quiet and dreamy blueunless he was roused by something , and then , she recalled , they could fire hot and cold in equal measure . He had long , dark lashes that her four sisters would have sold their soul for and a full , firm mouth that was meant , she supposed , for long kisses and soft words . Not that she knew of either firsthand . But she 'd heard tell . His nose was long and just slightly crooked from a line drive she 'd hit herself , smartly , when they 'd been playing American baseball more than ten years before . All in all , he had the face of some fairy-tale prince come to life . Some gallant knight on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a long , lanky body , wonderfully wide-palmed hands with the fingers of an artist , a voice like whiskey warmed by a turf fire , and he made quite the package . Not that she was interested , particularly . It was just that she appreciated things that were made well . And what a liar she was , even to herself . She 'd had a yen for him even before she 'd beaned him with that baseballand she 'd been fourteen to his nineteen at the time . And a yen tended to grow into something hotter , something nervier , by the time a woman was twenty-four . Not that he ever looked at her like she was a woman . Just as well , she assured herself , and shifted her stance . She did n't have time to hang around mooning over the likes of Shawn Gallagher . Some people had work to do . Fixing a thin sneer on her face , she deliberately lowered her toolbox and let it fall with a terrible clatter . That he jumped like a rabbit under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He scraped his chair around , thumped a hand to his heart as if to get it pumping again . " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " She continued to sneer . " Butterfingers , " she said sweetly and picked up her dented toolbox again . " Give you a start , did I ? " " You damn near killed me . " " Well , I knocked , but you did n't bother to come to the door . " " I did n't hear you . " He blew out a breath , scooped his hair back , and frowned at her . " Well , here 's the O'Toole come to call . Is something broken , then ? " " You 've a mind like a rusty bucket . " She shrugged out of her jacket , tossed it over the back of a chair . " Your oven there has n't worked for a week , " she reminded him with a nod toward the stove . " The part I ordered for it just came in . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a sound of assent and waved his hand toward it . " Biscuits ? " she said as she walked by the table . " What kind of breakfast is that for a man grown ? " " They were here . " He smiled at her in a way that made her want to cuddle him . " It 's a bother to cook just for myself most mornings , but if you 're hungry I 'll fix something up for the both of us . " " No , I 've eaten . " She set her toolbox down , opened it , started to rummage through . " You know Ma always fixes more than enough . She 'd be happy to have you wander down any morning you like and have a decent meal . " " You could send up a flare when she makes her griddle cakes . Will you have some tea in any case ? The pot 's still warm . " " I would n't mind it . " As she chose her tools , got out the new part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What were you doing ? Writing music ? " " Fiddling with words for a tune , " he said absently . His eye had caught the flight of a single bird , black and glossy against the dull pewter sky . " Looks bitter out today . " " ' T is , and damp with it . Winter 's barely started and I 'm wishing it over . " " Warm your bones a bit . " He crouched down with a thick mug of tea , fixed as he knew she liked it , strong and heavy on the sugar . " Thanks . " The heat from the mug seeped into her hands as she cupped them around it . He stayed where he was , sipping his own tea . Their knees bumped companionably . " So , what will you do about this heap ? " " What do you care as long as it works again ? " He lifted a brow . " If I know what you did , I might fix it myself next time . " This made her laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor to keep from tipping over . " You ? Shawn , you ca n't even fix your own broken fingernail . " " Sure I can . " Grinning , he mimed just biting one off and made her laugh again . " Do n't you concern yourself with what I do with the innards of the thing , and I wo n't concern myself with the next cake you bake in it . We each have our strengths , after all . " " It 's not as if I 've never used a screwdriver , " he said and plucked one out of her kit . " And I 've used a stirring spoon . But I know which fits my hand better . " She took the tool from him , then shifting her position , stuck her head in the oven to get to work . She had little hands , Shawn thought . A man might think of them as delicate if he did n't know what they were capable of doing . He 'd watched her swing a hammer , grip a drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , those little fairy hands of hers were nicked and scratched or bruised around the knuckles . She was such a small woman for the work she 'd chosen , or the work that had chosen her , he thought as he straightened . He knew how that was . Brenna 's father was a man of all work , and his eldest daughter took straight after him . Just as it was said Shawn took after his mother 's mother , who had often forgotten the wash or the dinner while she played her music . As he started to step back , she moved , her butt wriggling as she loosened a bolt . His eyebrows lifted again , in what he considered merely the reflexive interest of a male in an attractive portion of the female form . She did , after all , have a trim and tidy little body . The sort a man could scoop up one-handed if he had a mind to . And if a man tried , Shawn imagined Brenna O'Toole would lay him out flat . The idea made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face any day . It was such a study . Her eyes were lively and of a sharp , glass green under elegant brows just slightly darker than her bright red hair . Her mouth was mobile and quick to smile or sneer or scowl . She rarely painted itor the rest of her face , come to thatthough she was thick as thieves with Darcy , who would n't step a foot out of the house until she was polished to a gleam . She had a sharp little nose , like a pixie 's , that tended to wrinkle in disapproval or disdain . Most times she bundled her hair under a cap where she pinned the little fairy he 'd given her years before for some occasion or other . But when she took the cap off , there seemed miles of hair , a rich , bright red that sprang out in little curls as it pleased . It suited her that way . Because he wanted to see her face again before he took himself off to the pub , Shawn leaned back casually on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you 're walking out with Jack Brennan these days , I 'm hearing . " When her head came up swiftly and connected with the top of the oven with a resounding crack , Shawn winced , and wisely swallowed the chuckle . " I am not ! " As he 'd hoped , she popped out of the oven . There was a bit of soot on her nose , and as she rubbed her sore head , she knocked her cap askew . " Who said I am ? " " Oh . " Innocent as three lambs , Shawn merely shrugged and finished his tea . " I thought I heard it somewhere , ' round and about , as such things go . " " You 've a head full of cider and never hear a bloody thing . I 'm not walking out with anyone . I 've no time for that nonsense . " Annoyed , she stuck her head back in the oven . " Well , then , I 'm mistaken . Easy enough to be these days when the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies on the way . " " That 's the proper order , anyway . " He chuckled and came back to crouch beside her again . In a friendly way , he laid a hand on her bottom , but he did n't notice when she went very still . " Aidan and Jude are already picking out names , and she 's barely two months along yet . They 're lovely together , are n't they ? " " Aye . " Her mouth had gone dry with that yen that was perilously close to need . " I like seeing them happy . Jude likes to think the cottage is magic . She fell in love with Aidan here , and started her new life , wrote her book , all the things she says she was afraid even to dream of once happened right here . " " That 's lovely , too . There 's something about this place , " he said half to himself . " You feel it at odd moments . When you 're drifting off to sleep , or just waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new part in place , she eased out of the oven . His hand slid up her back lazily , then fell away . " Have you seen her " Lady Gwen ? " " No . Sometimes there 's a kind of movement on the air , just at the edge of your vision , but then nothing . " He pulled himself back , smiled carelessly , and got to his feet . " Maybe she 's not for me . " " I 'd think you the perfect candidate for a heartbroken ghost , " Brenna said and turned away from his surprised glance . " She should work fine now , " she added , giving the dial a turn . " We 'll just see if she heats up . " " You 'll see to that for me , wo n't you , darling ? " The oven timer buzzed , startling them both . " I 've got to be going , " Shawn said , reaching over to shut it off . " Is that your warning system , then ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on cue there came the cheerful bell from the clock by his bed . " That 's the second round , but it 'll go off on its own in a minute as it 's a windup . Otherwise , I found I 'd behaving to run in and slap it off every bloody time . " " Clever enough when it suits you , are n't you " " I have my moments . The cat 's out , " he continued as he took his own jacket from the hook . " Take no pity on him should he come scratching at the door . Bub knew what he was after when he insisted on moving out here with me . " " Did you remember to feed him ? " " I 'm not a complete moron . " Unoffended , he wrapped a scarf around his neck . " He has food enough , and if he did n't , he 'd go begging at your kitchen door . He 'd do that anyway , just to shame me . " He found his cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pub , then ? " " More than likely . " She did n't sigh until she 'd heard the front door close behind him . Yearnings in the direction of Shawn Gallagher were foolishness , she told herself . For he would never have the same aimed her way . He thought of her as a sisteror worse , she realized , as a kind of honorary brother . And that was her fault as well , she admitted , glancing down at her scruffy work pants and scarred boots . Shawn liked the girlie type , and she was anything but . She could flounce herself up , she supposed . Between Darcy and her own sisters , and Jude for that matter , she would have no limit of consultants on beautifying Brenna O'Toole . But beyond the fact that she hated all that fuss and bother , what would be the point in it ? If she polished and painted and cinched and laced to attract a man , he would n't be attracted to what she was in any case . Besides , if she put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shawn would likely laugh his lungs out , then say something stupid that would leave her no choice but to punch him . There was hardly a point in that . She 'd leave the fancy work to Darcy , who was the champion of being female . And to her sisters , Brenna thought , who enjoyed such things . As for herselfshe 'd stick with her tools . She went back to the oven , running it at different temperatures and checking the broiler for good measure . When she was satisfied it was in good working order , she turned it off , then packed up her tools . She meant to go straight out . There was no reason to linger , after all . But the cottage was so cozy . She 'd always felt at home there . When Old Maude Fitzgerald had lived in Faerie Hill Cottage , for more years than Brenna could count , Brenna had often stopped in for a visit . Then Maude had died , and Jude had come to stay for a while . They 'd become friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the routine of stopping in now and then on her way home , or into the village . She ignored the urge to stop in more often than not now that Shawn was living there . But it was hard to resist . She liked the quiet of the place , and all the pretty little things Maude had collected and left sitting about . Jude had left them there , and Shawn seemed content to do the same , so the little parlor was cheery with bits of glass and charming statues of faeries and wizards , homey with books and a faded old rug . Of course , now that Shawn had stuffed the secondhand spinet piano into the dollhouse space , there was barely room to turn around . But Brenna thought it only added to the charm . And Old Maude had enjoyed music . She 'd be pleased , Brenna thought as she skimmed her finger over the scarred black wood , that someone was making music in her house again . Idly , she scanned the sheet music that Shawn forever left scattered over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tune , or taking out an old one to change something . She frowned in concentration as she studied the squiggles and dots . She was n't particularly musical . Oh , she could sing out a rebel song without making the dog howl in response , but playing was a different kettle of fish altogether . Since she was alone , she decided to satisfy her curiosity . She set her toolbox down again , chose one of the sheets , and sat down . Gnawing her lip , she found middle C on the keyboard and slowly , painstakingly , picked out the written notes , one finger at a time . It was lovely , of course . Everything he wrote was lovely , and even her pitiful playing could n't kill the beauty of it completely . He 'd added words to this one , as he often did . Brenna cleared her throat and attempted to match her voice to the proper note . When I 'm alone in the night , and the moon sheds its tears , I know my world would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart is empty of all but the memories it keeps . You , only you , stay inside me in the night while the moon weeps . She stopped , sighed a little , as there was no one to hear . It touched her , as his songs always did , but a little deeper this time . A little truer . Moon tears , she thought . Pearls for Lady Gwen . A love that asked , but could n't be answered . " It 's so sad , Shawn . What 's inside you that makes such lonely music ? " As well as she knew him , she did n't know the answer to that . And she wanted to , had always wanted to know the key to him . But he was n't a motor or machine that she could take apart to find the workings . Men were more complicated and frustrating puzzles . It was his secret , and his talent , she supposed . All so internal and mysterious . While her skills were ... She looked down at her small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . At least she put hers to good use and made a proper living from them . What did Shawn Gallagher do with his great gift but sit and dream ? If he had a lick of ambition , or true pride in his work , he 'd sell his tunes instead of just writing them and piling them up in boxes . The man needed a good kick in the ass for wasting something God had given him . But that , she thought , was an annoyance for another day . She had work of her own to do . She started to get up , to reach for her toolbox again , when a movement caught the corner of her eye . She straightened like a spike , mortified at the thought of Shawn coming backhe was always forgetting somethingand catching her playing with his music . But it was n't Shawn who stood in the doorway . The woman had pale gold hair that tumbled around the shoulders of a plain gray dress that swept down to the floor . Her eyes were a soft green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first glance . Recognition , shock , and a giddy excitement raced through Brenna all at once . She opened her mouth , but whatever she intended to say came out in a wheeze as her pulse pounded . She tried again , faintly embarrassed that her knees were shaking . " Lady Gwen , " she managed . She thought it was admirable to be able to get out that much when faced with a three-hundred-year-old ghost . As she watched , a single tear , shiny as silver , trailed down the lady 's cheek . " His heart 's in his song . " Her voice was soft as rose petals and still had Brenna trembling . " Listen . " " What do you " But before Brenna could get the question out , she was alone , with only the faintest scent of wild roses drifting in the air . " Well , then . Well . " She had to sit , there was no help for it , so she let herself drop back down to the piano bench . " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart stopped thundering against her rib cage . When she thought her legs would hold her again , she decided it was best to tell the tale to someone wise and sensible and understanding . She knew no one who fit those requirements so well as her own mother . She calmed considerably on the short drive home . The O'Toole house stood back off the road , a rambling jigsaw puzzle of a place she herself had helped make so . When her father got an idea for a room into his head , she was more than pleased to dive into the ripping out and nailing up . Some of her happiest memories were of working side by side with Michael O'Toole and listening to him whistle the chore away . She pulled in behind her mother 's ancient car . They really did need to paint the old heap , Brenna thought absently , as she always did . Smoke was pumping from the chimneys . Inside was all welcome and warmth and the smells of the morning 's baking . She found her mother , Mollie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread out of the oven . " Ma . " " Oh , sweet Mary , girl , you gave me a start . " With a laugh , Mollie put the pans on the stovetop and turned with a smile . She had a pretty face , still young and smooth , and the red hair she 'd passed on to her daughter was bundled on top of her head for convenience . " Sorry , you 've got the music up again . " " It 's company . " But Mollie reached over to turn the radio down . Beneath the table , Betty , their yellow dog , rolled over and groaned . " What are you doing back here so soon ? I thought you had work . " " I did . I do . I 've got to go into the village yet to help Dad , but I stopped by Faerie Hill to fix the oven for Shawn. ? " Mmm-hmm . " Mollie turned back to pop the loaves out of the pan and set them on the rack to cool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there by myself for a bit . " When Mollie made the same absent sound , Brenna shifted her feet . " Then , ah , when I was leaving ... well , there was Lady Gwen . " " Mmm-hmm . What ? " Finally tuning in , Mollie looked over her shoulder at Brenna . " I saw her . I was just fiddling for a minute at the piano , and I looked up and there she was in the parlor doorway . " " Well , then , that must 've given you a start . " Brenna 's breath whooshed out . Sensible , that was Mollie O'Toole , bless her . " I all but swallowed me tongue then and there . She 's lovely , just as Old Maude used to say . And sad . It just breaks your heart how sad . " " I always hoped to see her myself . " A practical woman , Mollie poured two cups of tea and carried them to the table . " But I never did . " " I know Aidan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jude , when she moved into the cottage . " Relaxed again , Brenna settled at the table . " But I was just talking to Shawn of her , and he says he 's not seen hersensed her , but never seen . And then , there she was , for me . Why do you think that is ? " " I ca n't say , darling . What did you feel ? " " Other than a hard knock of surprise , sympathy , I guess . Then puzzlement because I do n't know what she meant by what she said to me . " " She spoke to you ? " Mollie 's eyes widened . " Why , I 've never heard of her speaking to anyone , not even Maude . She 'd have told me . What did she say to you ? " " She said , ' His heart 's in his song , ' then she just told me to listen . And when I got back my wits enough to ask her what she meant , she was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his piano you were playing with , I 'd say the message was clear enough . " " But I listen to his music all the time . You ca n't be around him five minutes without it . " Mollie started to speak , then thought better of it and only covered her daughter 's hand with her own . Her darling Mary Brenna , she thought , had such a hard time recognizing anything she could n't pick apart and put together again . " I 'd say when it 's time for you to understand , you will . " " She makes you want to help her , " Brenna murmured . " You 're a good lass , Mary Brenna . Perhaps before it 's done , help her is just what you 'll do . "
