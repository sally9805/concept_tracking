Her eye followed the slim border of scrolled wood running the length of the bar 's chalet roof , then tracked down to the window which afforded a view of rows and rows of parked cars dull in the evening sun , and finally reversed direction across bare-topped surface to her raised forearm and bent wrist , resembling a still black swan in the round pond of table . There on her finger was the true point of attraction : a thick platinum ring with a diamond the size of her knuckle . She let her hand drop gavellike to the surface with a thud and eased back in her seat . Nursed a strawberry daiquiri and worried time like a bone . She 'd asked Les to meet her here , The Happy Medium , a bar down the street from the bank where she worked and where she 'd come every evening for the past week , taking her usual seat at the circular booth , away from the light , the door , and the draft . Faces waved with festive expressions . Voices ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sentence would jet up above the general buzz , human insect noise . Everything was turning around inside her . Les had been making too many business trips of late , and even when he was with her , he seemed far away . Some difference in the way he held her , a softening of muscles and affection , his hands seemingly too awkward for her body . These past weeks she 'd gotten physically sick , sick with worry-headaches , chills , tics , and vomiting . She was convinced that someone was fishing in her private pond . <p> Hi , baby . <p> She had not seen him enter . He was forty minutes late . She looked up from her drink and saw him smiling that smile , like he 'd won a contest , smiling so that his long thin sharp lips caught the dim light and split clean through her anger . <p> Hi , she said . <p> Like a waiter awaiting a deserved tip , he stood tall and unmoving before her booth , giving her time to notice him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forearm . Honeybrown skin . A five-inch block of hair rising from the top of his head , like some object he was balancing there to improve his posture . He leaned forward-might the block of hair topple to the floor ? - kissed her on the cheek-a small burst of warmth from his lips-then moved with iron confidence to take his seat . Baby , what 's new ? His gray eyes saw without light . <p> Her hands closed around her glass . Bitch , she said . <p> He went stiff as a new deck of cards , the word raw and red on the parched linen of his shirt . <p> What ? <p> Just calling a spade a spade . <p> He sat there with his mouth open , his tongue rolling . Baby , I 'm sorry I 'm late , but <p> Are you squeezing somebody 's lemon ? <p> He laughed a low-breath laugh . What ? <p> Just answer the question . <p> The words seemed to fall heavy upon him . His shoulders dropped . He leaned forward in his seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her breath , waiting . She knew exactly what he would say . Baby , you know you 're the one for me . He looked right at her with his gray eyes . The luck of my life . <p> The old feelings came back for a moment , like a quick glimpse of light behind a flapping curtain . She wanted to forgive him . <p> Why , we 're going to start a family . <p> She sipped her drink to renew her strength , then pinched and held the wings of her nose . When Les did n't react , she pulled out her black lace handkerchief and put it over her nose and mouth . <p> What 's wrong ? <p> Shit 's running out your mouth . <p> His eyes went red . Remember , baby . You 're the queen , but I 'm the goddamn king . <p> Once had a dog named King . <p> His eyes darted out of control . Fuck <p> She slapped him two times , palm and backhand , a doubleedged sword . Imprinted violence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The red mark instantly started to swell and lightened in color as it expanded . She slapped the diamond ring down on the table . Here . Squeeze this around your dick . <p> They 'd met a year earlier at the bank where she worked as a clerk . He had been shy and tentative at first , his handshake cool and damp . Then he started coming to her station every day with his smile , candy , cards , flowers , and compliments . She agreed to dine with him one afternoon . Found herself so deeply enjoying his company that she forgot to peruse the menu before the waiter arrived at their table with a bottle of wine , an Australian vintage of Less choosing . She asked him any question she so desired , and he answered with open pleasure , his laugh close and comfortable . She had to admit , he was quite a talker , and she found herself seizing upon the beauty of every phrase . If you would go high , use your own legs . Hope alone acquaints us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown comfortable enough to allow him to kiss her , a quick bird peck on the cheek . That first kiss buttered her up for more , so she took the further step of allowing him to visit her on Sunday mornings at her home , where he would take his polite place on the couch beside her and join her in watching her favorite pay-per-view religious service on cable TV . Nowhere did her feelings for him tell so strongly as in this setting . Who would have thought this man , in his neatly cut suit , sturdy and plain in style ? <p> The night he proposed , six months into their dating , he took her to a restaurant with a four-story marble waterfall , a thin moving sheet of wet force that fell to a basin with colorful , darting fish . They sat knees touching at a small cloth-covered table in the dim light of a glass-encased candle . And they enjoyed the best dinner she could recall . <p> Then he spoke to her with the rich sweet taste of Shiraz on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noise of rushing water . She could feel the strength of his love coursing through their knee contact . <p> I think it 's time . He held out the ring . I hope you want this as much as I do . He ran his tongue over his top lip , holding her gaze . Baby , let your love come through . We 'll have a big family . Googobs of kids . Heirs to our tea empire . Hell , we 'll be our own country . He was smiling hard , blinking moisture from his eyes . <p> A powerful current of feeling surged through her . She spoke , her voice escaping , struggling to get away to silence . <p> They spent the night in his gurgling Jacuzzi , her breasts floating on the water 's surface . <p> Nothing more to do with Les . Nothing more to do with Les . Nothing more to do with Les . She repeated the phrase over and over again to herself in the listening night . Forest gloom , country gloom , darkness which should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over stones in her path , might there have been light underneath ? <p> She walked slowly , night with the holding force of water . No amount of effort could move her faster , step after heavy step , sapping her strength . Ah , streetlamps up ahead . Clouds of insects performing in spotted glare . Perhaps it had rained . Fish-shaped leaves stuck to lampposts and gutters too deep to see into . Heat reshaped her . She would never give thought to Les again . <p> She existed , was given substance and form by noises patterned around her . A shape slipped out of a doorway quick as an angel . Joined a congregation of more shapes at the corner and led them like a herd of dirty sheep to the liquor store across the street . She sang the sight away . <p> Just a closer walk with thee <p> Just a closer walk with thee <p> She heard squabbling birds she could not see . She stepped past , dodged ponds of aging piss . The neighborhood was changing . She would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red light , her legs limp with relief . Today was Friday . My weekend is fucked , she thought with an honest heart . Fucked . And what about our other plans : the Bahamas cruisedouble-decker cocktails , a buffet of horizons , saddleless horses , and tensionless sea-or the weekend getaway to Virginia Beach ? <p> Green signaled her forward , and she sang long , silent , and sweet about past wrongs . Men tried and abandoned . Men never tried . Men she would never try . She firmly believed that it took two slices of like-grained bread to make a good sandwich . Imagine combining a slice of white bread and a slice of wheat , or a square slice and a French tube , or a bagel half and a kaiser <p> A car zoomed by so fast the air smacked together after it . She tongued smoke from her lips . <p> She recalled standing with a crowd of women in a musicjammed club , watching the French Tickler work his glittery hips . Long stilt-like beams of light walked on , over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a maze , so many twists and turns . Hours later , she saw him trying to avoid detection in the shadows outside the club . He was leaning against a parking meter but walked over without hesitation when her gaze caught his . I could n't help but notice you , he said . All those hundreds of women in the club , and there was your face , the calm in the storm . Please allow me , I 'm Horace . He held out his hand , and she shook it . And your name would be ? Well , Miss Sheila , I know this dime spot up the street where they throw down some serious grits and eggs . She rarely found herself dating men for looks alone , but he had been put together with care . Even in an old shirt-the tails hanging out-and faded jeans , his body gave off drawing force . And he stood high and tall , like a captain directing the world from the bow of his ship . She accepted his offer to breakfast , with doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for less than a month . In that short span of time , he made her voracious with the need to discover . They bounced on her firm mattress trampoline-like , licked TV glow from their skin , left their deep forms in damp earth and soft stone , lovers tracking each other in the dark by the sounds they made . She burned with the need to tell him something wonderful , something he 'd never dreamed could happen . <p> Then one night , he spoke her name with smooth , young girl lips . He was sitting in his favorite chair-a caneback-completely nude , body slick and glistening from an olive oil lotioning , his legs spread wide like a scissors , his thick thighs partly obscured in the darkness . He flexed and unflexed his fingers to rid them of stiffness . Babygirl , he said , why do n't you dance for me ? <p> And you ai n't even tell me , Toosha said , barely audible , a bad connection , hum and hiss and other voices low in the background , a ghostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I did n't want to be hasty . I had to make sure that Les was n't like all the others . <p> When can I meet him ? <p> Soon . <p> So he 's the one ? <p> Yes . <p> Girl , I 'm happy for you . <p> Thanks . She shut her eyes and pictured Toosha 's face . Dark skin . Fat cheeks . Little eyes like watermelon seeds . And two thin cornrows , dyed red , rising out the top of her head like TV antennae . Her head was shaved bald everywhere else . <p> What does Les do ? <p> He owns a teashop . <p> Say what ? A teacher ? Teachers do n't <p> No . He owns a teashop . A whole chain of them . The Sonic Chitlins Cafe . <p> Word ? I stopped at one just a few days ago . Downtown on Madison . Strobe lights ? Waitresses with short-short miniskirts ? <p> Yes . <p> Girl , he 's large . Hey , vast money-you ca n't beat that . Hope his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-flat building was flanked by trees , where she could walk for hours on the hint of a path and never meet another human being . Layered branches groaned and cracked . Her shadow and the shadow of leaves like a jigsaw puzzle which moonlight tried to piece together . The grass underfoot was dry and brittle despite watering . Whatever troubled her veered away and nested somewhere in the trees among the unseen birds . <p> She entered her apartment to discover dull yellow urine percolating in the toilet . The toilet flushed angrily and sucked the air with it . She dropped to the tub and sat dizzy on the edge , eyes closed . Did Les have a key ? Had she given him one ? Had he cut his own ? <p> She rose in a dreamlike whirl and set the faucet running . Needed a bath after the heat , not a teasing shower . She allowed the water to run to appropriate temperature , rise to desired height , then climbed into the tub and sat down . Took white soap in her dark fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slowly massaged her unmoving legs , her dark fingers rubbing , squeezing , pinching . That done , she lay back in the tub , stirring ripples before her , a succession of half-circles expanding one within the other . Water closed over her , up to her chin . She rested and so did the water , clear and still . <p> Sash knotted-she did not recollect leaving the bath , draining the tub , scrubbing it clean , drying herself thoroughly ( she had not dripped on the floor ) , or slipping on her terrycloth robe-she flopped down on the couch and reviewed her mail . Bills . Solicitations . And a card from Les postmarked from Mauritius two weeks earlier . She had n't realized until then that she expected to arrive home and find him at her front door seeking forgiveness , trying to sweet-talk her with wedding plans . Where it would be held , where they would honeymoon , where they would live after . <p> She tossed the mail aside and tried to think back to when she had her first serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter now ? ) Six months of courtship and fun . ( Or was it eight ? ) Then he began to talk business with his morning swallow of coffee . Downline options , digital capital , bipolar technology . Such talk developed a physical need for travel , and he answered this need with business trips-he was forever on his way out , flight bag draped over his shoulder , airline ticket in hand , and the back of his head as he stepped out the door-two or three every week . Baby , success is ninety-five percent ability and five percent luck . You have to take the bull by the horns . I 'm going international . China is pretty much sewn up , but I hear the Zulus like their tea . <p> Then one day while he was away on business , she decided to drop into one of his teahouses and have a cup of Royal Grey and perhaps ease her longing for him . She was less than a half-block from the cafe when she saw a man pop out the establishment with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that man was Les , could identify him by the distinctive shape of his head . Les ! she yelled . The man did not turn around . Les ! The man quickened his step and disappeared around the corner with his woman . <p> The memory was bitter and offensive . No doubt , breaking up with Les was the best decision she had ever made . To reassure herself she picked up the phone receiver and tapped Toosha 's number . While she waited for the line to pick up , some other thought vibrated through her , nagging . <p> Hey , girl . <p> Hey . <p> How 's life treatin ' you ? <p> Just crying the blues and drinkin ' cheap liquor . <p> I heard that . She twirled the coiled cord around her finger . So what you up to tonight ? <p> Going out . <p> That figures . Friday and Saturday nights , Toosha sought her fortune in the clubs : Taste , The Cherry Blossom , Tragedy for Free , Strictly Business , Contending Forces , and Heroes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who caught her fancy . A man would stay with her for a week or two before Toosha would say , See ya ! , and hop off to the next trick . <p> What you up to ? <p> Not much . <p> So how was your day ? <p> She tilted her head , shrugged , as if Toosha could see her . I broke up with Les today . <p> What ? <p> He 's an asshole . A bitch . <p> I thought you really liked him . What happened ? <p> Where do I begin ? <p> Tell me . <p> She told Toosha about her suspicions . Told her how Les had not even bothered to seriously address these suspicions . <p> It 's good you dropped him , Toosha said . Change your cross for a crown . <p> She said nothing . <p> In the meantime , why do n't you give French a call ? You know I do n't backslide . <p> Even for a night ? <p> You 're too much . <p> That 's what they say . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No way . Last time they 'd gone out together , Toosha had flicked her tongue fast and dirty at some cute guy barely old enough to gain entry into the club . Once upon a time Sheila might have done the same . Indeed , she recognized in Toosha 's sexual exploits the workings of her own mind . Who would n't want to get all they could ? Human nature . But they were both months shy of thirty and ought to be too wise , too seasoned to be caught up in all that shuttling back and forth . <p> What you got to lose ? <p> You know that ai n't me , she said . <p> Sheila heard flesh give and stretch as Toosha tugged into her leather thong . She groomed and dressed-always the brightest colors-for three hours before she went out into the world . Do n't catch nothing . <p> I always make sure homeboy wear his raincoat . Rubber can take a lot of tear and wear . <p> Peace . <p> Peace . <p> She hung up the phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch . Then she noticed the room was completely dark , so she picked up the remote control and popped on the television . Blue flickering light brushed her legs feather-like , bare skin not covered by the robe . This same light penetrated her muscles like quills . Time curled around her . She saw without seeing and heard without hearing . The couch began to curve over her and under her , the jaws of a shell , and she felt her skin ossify . <p> The phone rang . <p> Is this Miss Jones ? <p> Yes . <p> Sheila Jones ? <p> Yes . <p> Well , today is your lucky day , Miss Jones . I 'm happy to inform you that you are the proud winner of a free plot at Greenview <p> She slammed the receiver to the cradle . The nerve of some people . A free cemetery plot . She stayed hunched over and silent , then she sensed an indistinct tingling and sought to identify it . Her finger . She looked down at it in the light and saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second phantom ring . She scratched it , not feeling in the least out of anything . No more Les . No more Les . No more Les . She turned back to the TV and tried to pick up where she had left off . <p> Try our new fragrant ambrosia flavor . To drown <p> She switched the channel . <p> Would you kindly spin the wheel ? <p> She switched again . <p> The phone rang . <p> Soft whispered words . She yanked the phone cord from the wall . She saw through him instantly . She said it to herself with a clear little laugh . Outside the unshaded window the night spread clean and starless , while fingered branches held the moon in the sky . She felt a stab of uncertainty , not knowing what she had said , not knowing what she had meant , or might have meant . Blue light tingled at her toes like cold dark water . <p> A delay is not a denial . He was tiny there , a fuzzy dot , and as he drew nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can return again . He seemed oddly helpless , pinned to his lectern by sharp watching faces . Is this not his promise ? He smiled his church smile . The crown outlasts the head . <p> She separated voice from body , dissected mouth from message . Ah , now she knew . It was the Reverend Martin " Spider " Thornhill , " God 's hardest-working servant " a clear-skinned man with red hair and freckles to match . She found nothing attractive about him . He was short , wide , and ugly , like a pit bull . <p> All history moves towards one great goal . His voice reverberated through the room so that she heard three or four voices . Exodus . The manifestation of God . <p> He said this merrily with light darting from his eyes , a true believer , taking no notice of his circumstances . She watched with increasing fascination and delight . The small figures of the congregation , choir , and pastor seemed trapped inside the TV , a luminous birdcage . And she sought to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her hand and stroke it . <p> Jesus spoke from the cross , I have suffered many troubles and hardships in battle and tempest ; this will be only one more . <p> Spontaneous applause . <p> The hand of God is slow but sure . All days are His . <p> Light pulled like tape at her skin . And she touched herself all over to remain in place . <p> When your time comes and He takes you to his bosom , you must rise and follow , rise and follow . <p> She watched her legs waver in blue light as if underwater . Rising . <p> But with this spear I shall lift you up . Am I not a fisher of men ? The words altered his face , made something gentle happen . <p> Let us pray . <p> She bowed her head and clicked her eyes shut . Words tumbled through her skull . Lights flashing in the dark , broken bits of sparkle . She scratched her finger and repeated the words to herself , spoke them out loud-two voices in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validity . <p> Amen . <p> Amen , she said-so loud she startled herself She opened her eyes as if from a kiss . <p> Let us pause for station identification . He stepped down off the stage . Tuxedoed men set up a large floral arrangement behind the lectern , all hue and fragrance . ( She pinched her nose . Thought to sneeze . ) Seven young girls with seven flaming-red afros set off slowly down seven aisles , moving in rhythm . Left foot step . Pause . Right foot step . Pause . Each wore a white dress and white gloves , one hand **25;1402;TOOLONG cloth-lined ( red ) silver collection plate at the shoulder , the other crooked behind the back , as if cuffed . <p> Author Affiliation
