The All-American President " Ronald Reagan had warmth , wit and an uncanny ability to put people at ease , no matter their ideology . " PETER LAUTZ San Diego <P> Nancy Gibbs ' story on the life of Ronald Reagan , " The All-American President " June 14 , so eloquently captured and conveyed the man 's essence that I can imagine the Great Communicator smiling and giving her a wink ! JIM SHARP Plainfield , N.J. <P> Reagan was a remarkable person whose life epitomized the American Dream . Rising from humble beginnings , he succeeded in Hollywood , broke into politics and became President as a grandfather figure to the American people . His soothing voice gave an unsure nation hope and a positive outlook on the future . He knew firsthand the toils of the common man and strove to make the country a better and safer place to live . PAUL A. JERECZEK Dodge , Wis . <P> Gibbs wrote that Reagan was " a man of easy grace and endless hope . " But it 's not hard to be that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reagan was such a man . How many spiraling budget deficits and Nicaraguans killed by U.S.-supported contras does it take for Americans to stop patting themselves on the back and pause for a moment to look at the true legacy of this President ? STEPHEN CONN Las Cruces , N.M . <P> Some might not have liked Reagan 's policies or programs , but it can not be denied that he was a great and true American . His Christian belief and conduct exemplified the vision of our country 's Founding Fathers . He is accused of having been too far to the right , but when I examine the man , I see someone who was simply well centered . SAMUEL D. HOPPER Palmdale , Calif . <P> Reagan was not a saint . He traded illegal arms to the contra militia in Nicaragua . He increased the gap between rich and poor in the U.S. He supported a racist regime in South Africa and shamefully allowed tens of thousands of Americans to suffer from AIDS while his Administration turned its back on the epidemic . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRIAN BLANK Chicago <P> Reagan 's White House years were America 's best . We were proud of ourselves , our country and our President . We felt secure in the knowledge that Reagan was at the helm of the nation . I do n't think we will ever see the likes of him again . He was a man for the ages . PENNY BARWICK Orange Park , Fla . <P> Americans seem to take pride in giving themselves one of two labels , Republican or Democrat . On the occasion of Reagan 's death , it was refreshing to witness the divisive labels dropped for a common descriptor : American . As a Canadian , I was moved by the displays of Americans ' patriotism  --  men and women placing hands over hearts as the coffin passed by and the frequent singing of national songs . Days later , I found myself still humming God Bless America . KATHLEEN GRAVES Calgary , Alta .
