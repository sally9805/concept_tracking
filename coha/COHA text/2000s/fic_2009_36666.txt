After booking my ticket to the Netherlands , I sat quietly in front of the computer , contemplating what to do next . <br> Outside the rain carried out its spring fling with gusto . Telling my husband seemed wise . Not on the phone , though . I did n't want to say the words " abnormal mammogram , " " biopsy , " or " I 'm leaving for a week " unless I could see his face . <br> So I decided to bake cookies . After padding my way to the kitchen , I pulled out a mixing bowl and turned the oven to 375 degrees . <br> I 'm not the sort of woman who takes a long bath or a long walk to have time and space to think . For me , the best processing happens when I have my well-used mixing bowl balanced on my hip . No electric mixers for me . I beat the lumps out of my life challenges with a wooden spoon . <br> Then I line up all the solutions in my head while arranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon the scent of all that lovely butter , brown sugar , and oatmeal wafts from the kitchen , and I start to feel better . <br> The fragrance fills the house with a standing invitation for my children to " come hither . " As they gather around the kitchen counter , I remember what really matters , and my problem is somehow quietly resolved . <br> Only this time I knew that when the enticing fragrance raced down the hall into each bedroom , it would find no takers . All our children were launched and flitting about in their own worlds . <br> Abnormal . Biopsy . <br> I went after the cookie dough with renewed mixing vigor . Taking a few steps closer to the refrigerator , I looked over the collection of off-kilter photos until I found the one of Noelle standing in a field of tulips with a windmill in the background . <br> You 're going there , Summer . It 's going to happen . You 're going to see Noelle . You really are . Believe it . <br> For many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every time I would stop mid  --  pot roast extraction or post  --  milk replenishment , the images I would look for were the ones of Noelle and her world . <br> How long had I dreamed of seeing those tilt-a-wheel windmills and picking those bursting-with-color tulips by the armful ? <br> As I dropped the dough into agreeable rows and slid the cookie sheets into the oven , I made another decision . I would tell Wayne everything as soon as he came home . But I would n't tell anyone else about the biopsy until I had received the results . Not even Noelle . <br> If everything worked out for me to see Noelle , I wanted to spend my time with her as unencumbered as possible . I would take the trip in a self-induced state of denial . Yes , complete denial . It was the only way I would be able to enjoy the visit . <br> I foraged around in the garage for a suitcase and went hunting through Wayne 's desk for my passport . The scent of warm cookies encircled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of comfort food when faced with monumental decisions . I 'm convinced that the fragrance of cinnamon and sugar enlivens the heart and strengthens the senses when a woman is in want of a special measure of courage . <br> My courage lasted all afternoon and kept me company as I ran errands . Denial can be a wonderful thing.Why had I never called upon its fabulous powers before ? <br> I was eager to reach home to see if Noelle had read my e-mail yet . In the rhythmof our online correspondence , I would write to her toward the close ofmy day , and she would read my post at the start of her new day.The time difference between our two lives was six hours . She was always six hours ahead of me . Maybe she had seen my e-mail before going to bed . Maybe she already had responded . <br> The rain stopped as I rounded the corner , returning home with a full tank of gas and a week 's worth of groceries . Wayne 's car was in the garage when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hanging tennis ball to make sure the van was in far enough to close the garage door . As the tennis ball did its usual bounce-bounce against the windshield , anxiety surged in my stomach . Everything in me tightened . I sat in the car , waiting for the cinnamon-laced courage to come back . <br> I was n't afraid of what Wayne would say . He is a great husband . I did n't always think that , but I do now . The longer we 've been married , the better our relationship has become . The anxiety was connected to my logic in all this . How wise was it for me to leave the country right now ? What would be the repercussions of staying in denial for another week or so ? <br> Wayne stepped out into the garage.He peered at me through the windshield with a half-eaten cookie in his hand . <br> " You coming in ? " <br> I nodded but did n't move . <br> " Summer ? " <br> I could n't quite get my body to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you okay ? " Wayne came over to the passenger side.He opened the door and climbed in.His current position at our church as one of the associate pastors includes most of the counseling load . Wayne is a careful listener . He is intuitive and empathetic in his approach , which was quite an adjustment from the " Wild Wayne " I had married when I was nineteen years old . Life , love , loss , and raising six children had had a marinating effect on his heart . He is a big softy now . <br> " Is it one of the kids ? " Wayne reached over and wove his fingers through my nearly shoulder-length brown hair.With a steady hand hemassaged the back ofmy neck . " What is it ? What 's wrong ? " <br> I let out a long sigh and then exhaled all the details , starting with the phone call and rolling right into how I had put a flight to Amsterdamon hold and had e-mailed Noelle , asking if I could come see her for a week . <br> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim of the steering wheel , waiting for his response , which I knew could go either way . The neighbor 's schnauzer barked . The car 's engine pinged . Wayne untangled his fingers from my hair and said the last thing I expected . " Good for you . " <br> I turned to take in his full expression . " Does that mean you think I should do this ? I should go to the Netherlands ? " <br> " Summer , for as long as I 've known you , you 've talked about meeting Noelle . Yes , I think you should do this , and , yes , I think now is the time to go . The biopsy can wait another week or so , ca n't it ? " <br> " I think so . " <br> Wayne took my hand in his . " Do you remember what you told the kids when they left the house ? " <br> I nodded . My farewell line was the same for each of them , and after saying it six times , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't realized that Wayne had heard me say it . Or had remembered it . <br> " You told the kids , ' Go make your own adventures , and come home often to tell us about them . ' " He smiled . " I 'd say it 's time for you to do the same . Go make your own adventure , honey . When you come home , I 'll want to hear all about it . " <br> Continues ...
