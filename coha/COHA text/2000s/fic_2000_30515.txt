Prologue The State of Connecticut will prove that Molly Carpenter Lasch , with the intent to cause the death of her husband , Dr. Gary Lasch , did in fact cause his death ; that as he sat at his desk , his back to her , she shattered his skull with a heavy bronze sculpture ; that she then left him to bleed to death as she went upstairs to their bedroom and fell asleep .... The reporters seated behind the defendant scribbled furiously , roughing out the articles they would have to file in just a couple of hours if they were to meet their deadlines . The veteran columnist from Women 's News Weekly began inking her usual gushing prose : " The trial of Molly Carpenter Lasch , charged with the murder of her husband , Gary , opened this morning in the mellow dignity of the courtroom in historic Stamford , Connecticut . " Media from all over the country were covering the trial . The New York Post reporter was jotting down a description of Molly 's appearance , noting in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a knockout , he thought , a remarkable blend of classy and gorgeous . It was not a combination that he often saw especially at the defense table . He noticed how she sat , tall , almost regal . No doubt some would say " defiant . " He knew she was twenty-six . He could see that she was slender . Had collar-length , dark blond hair . That she wore a blue suit and small gold earrings . He craned his neck until he could see that she was still wearing her wedding band . He made note of it . As he watched , Molly Lasch turned and looked around the courtroom as though searching for familiar faces . For a moment their eyes met , and he noted that hers were blue ; , they ca n't hurt me . She was aware of the eyes on her , curious and judgmental . Some of the people she had known best and longest had come up to her in the corridor , kissing her cheek , squeezing her hand . Jenna Whitehall , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was one of them . Jenna was a corporate lawyer now . Her husband , Cal , was chairman of the board of Lasch Hospital and of the HMO Gary had founded with Dr. Peter Black . They 've both been wonderful , Molly thought . Needing to get away from everything , she had sometimes stayed with Jen in New York during the past months , and it had helped tremendously . Jenna and Cal still lived in Greenwich , but during the week , Jenna frequently overnighted at a Manhattan apartment they kept near U.N . Plaza . Molly had seen Peter Black in the corridor as well . Dr. Peter Black he always had been so pleasant to her , but like Gary 's mother , he ignored her now . The friendship between him and Gary dated from their days in medical school . Molly wondered if Peter would be able to fill Gary 's shoes as head of the hospital and the HMO . Shortly after Gary 's death , he 'd been elected by the board to take over as chief executive officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial actually began . The prosecutor began calling witnesses . As they came and went , they seemed to Molly to be just blurred faces and voices . Then Edna Barry , the plump sixty-year-old woman who had been their part-time housekeeper , was on the stand . " I came in at eight o'clock on Monday morning , as usual , " she stated . " Monday morning , April 9th ? " " Yes . " " How long had you been working for Gary and Molly Lasch ? " " Four years . But I 'd worked for Molly ' s mother from the time Molly was a little girl . She was always so gentle . " Molly caught the sympathetic look Mrs. Barry cast toward her . She does n't want to hurt me , she thought , but she 's going to tell how she found me , and she knows how it will sound . " I was surprised because the lights were on inside the house , " Mrs. Barry was saying . " Molly 's suitcase was in the foyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mrs. Barry , please describe the layout of the first floor of the house . " " The foyer is large it 's really more of a reception area . When they had large parties they would serve cocktails there before dinner . The living room is directly beyond the foyer and faces the front door . The dining room is to the left , down a wide hallway and past a service bar . The kitchen and family room are in that wing as well , while the library and Dr. Lasch 's study are in the wing to the right of the entrance . " I got home early , Molly thought . There had n't been much traffic on I-95 , and I was earlier than I 'd expected to be . I only had one bag with me , and I brought it in and put it down . Then I locked the door and called Gary 's name . I went directly to the study to look for him . " I went into the kitchen , " Mrs. Barry told the prosecutor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese and crackers on the counter . " " Was there anything unusual about that ? " " Yes . Molly always tidied up when they had company . " " What about Dr. Lasch ? " the prosecutor asked . Edna Barry smiled indulgently . " Well , you know men . He was n't much for picking up after himself . " She paused and frowned . " But that was when I knew something was wrong . I thought that Molly must have come and gone . " " Why would she have done that ? " Molly saw the hesitance in Mrs. Barry 's face as once again she looked over at her . Mother was always a little annoyed that Mrs. Barry called me Molly and I called her Mrs. Barry . But I did n't care , she thought . She 's known me since I was a child . " Molly had n't been home when I went in on Friday . The Monday before that , while I was there , she 'd left for the Cape . She seemed terribly upset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and abruptly . Molly was aware of the hostility the prosecutor felt for her , but for some reason it did n't worry her . " She was crying as she packed her bag , and I could see that she was very angry . Molly 's an easygoing person . It takes a lot to ruffle her . In all the years I 'd worked there , I 'd never once seen her so upset . She kept saying , ' How could he ? How could he ? ' I asked her if there was anything I could do . " " What did she say ? " " She said , ' You can kill my husband . ' " " ' You can kill my husband ! ' " " I knew she did n't mean it . I just thought they 'd probably had an argument , and I figured she was leaving for the Cape to cool down . " " Did she often go off like that ? Just pack up and leave ? " " Well , Molly likes the Cape ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was different I 'd never seen her leave like this , so upset . " She looked at Molly , sympathy in her eyes . " All right , Mrs. Barry , let 's go back to that Monday morning , April 9th . What did you do after you 'd seen the condition of the kitchen ? " " I went to see if Dr. Lasch was in the study . The door was closed . I knocked , and there was no answer . I turned the knob and noticed it felt sticky . Then I pushed open the door and saw him . " Edna Barry 's voice quivered . " He was slumped over in his chair at the desk . His head was caked with dried blood . There was blood all over him and the desk and the chair and the carpet . I knew right away he was dead . " Listening to the housekeeper 's testimony , Molly thought back to that Sunday night . I came home , let myself in , locked the front door , and went down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door was closed . I opened it .... I do n't remember what happened after that . " What did you do then , Mrs. Barry ? " the prosecutor asked . " I dialed 9-1-1 right away . Then I thought about Molly , that maybe she was hurt . I ran upstairs to her bedroom . When I saw her in there , on the bed , I thought she was dead too . " " Why did you think that ? " " Because her face was crusted with blood . But then she opened her eyes and smiled and said , ' Hi , Mrs. Barry , I guess I overslept . ' " I looked up , Molly thought as she sat at the defense table , and then realized I still had my clothes on . For a moment I thought I 'd been in an accident . My clothes were soiled , and my hands felt all sticky . I felt groggy and disoriented and wondered if maybe I was in a hospital instead of my own room . I remember wondering if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounding at the door downstairs , and the police were there . All about her , people were talking , but the voices of the witnesses were blurring again . Molly was vaguely aware of the days of the trial passing , of going in and out of the courtroom , of watching people coming and going on the witness stand . She heard Cal and Peter Black and then Jenna testify . Cal and Peter told how on Sunday afternoon they had called Gary and said they were coming over , that they knew something was wrong . They sa id they found Gary terribly upset because Molly had learned he was having an affair with Annamarie Scalli . Cal said that Gary told him that Molly had been at their home in Cape Cod all week and would n't talk to him when he called , that she slammed down the phone when she heard his voice . The prosecutor asked , " What was your reaction to Dr. Lasch 's confession of this affair ? " Cal said they were deeply concerned , both for their friends ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a scandal involving Dr. Lasch and a young nurse . Gary had assured them there would be no scandal . Annamarie was leaving town . She was planning to give up the baby for adoption . His lawyer had arranged a $75,000 settlement and confidentiality statement that she had already signed . Annamarie Scalli , Molly thought , that pretty , dark-haired , sexy-looking young nurse . She remembered meeting her at the hospital . Had Gary been in love with her , or was it just a casual affair that got out of hand when Annamarie became pregnant ? Now she 'd never know . There were so many unanswered questions . Did Gary really love me ? she wondered . Or was our life together a sham ? She shook her head . No . It hurt too much to think like that . Then Jenna had taken the stand . I know it hurts her to testify , Molly thought , but the prosecutor had subpoened her , and she had no choice . " Yes , " Jenna had acknowledged , her voice low and halting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day that Gary died . She told me that he had been involved with Annamarie and that Annamarie was pregnant . Molly was totally devastated . " Vaguely she heard what they were saying . The prosecutor asking if Molly was angry . Jenna saying Molly was hurt . Jenna fin ally admitted that Molly was very angry with Gary . " Molly , get up . The judge is leaving . " Philip Matthews , her lawyer , was holding her elbow , urging her to stand . He kept his hand under her arm , steadying her as they exited the courtroom . Outside , flashbulbs exploded in her face . He made her hurry through the crowd , propelling her into a waiting car . " We 'll meet your mother and father at the house , " he said as they drove away . Her parents had come up from Florida to be with her . They wanted her to move , to get out of the house where Gary had died , but she could n't do that . It was her grandmother 's present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's insistence , she had agreed to at least redecorate the study . All the furniture was given away , and the room was redone from top to bottom . The heavy mahogany paneling had been stripped off , and Gary 's treasured collection of early-American furniture and art had been removed . His paintings , sculptures , carpets , oil lamps , and Wells Fargo desk along with his maroon leather couch and chairs had been replaced with a brightly patterned chintz sofa and matching love seat and bleached oak tables . Even then , the door to the study was always kept closed . One most valued piece in his collection , a thirty-inch-high sculpture of a horse and rider , an original Remington bronze , was still in the custody of the prosecutor 's office . That was what they said she had used to smash the back of Gary 's head . Sometimes , when she was sure her parents were asleep , Molly would tiptoe downstairs and stand in the doorway of the study and try to remember every detail of finding Gary . Finding Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought back to that night , there was n o single moment when she remembered talking to him or approaching him as he sat at his desk . She had no memory of picking up that sculpture , of grasping the front legs of the horse and swinging it with enough force to cave in his skull . But that 's what they said she had done . At home now , after another day in court , she could see the growing concern on her parents ' faces , and she could feel the increased protectiveness with which they hugged her . She stood stiffly inside their embraces , then stepped away and looked at them dispassionately . Yes , a handsome couple everyone called them that . Molly knew she looked like Ann , her mother . Walter Carpenter , her father , towered over both of them . His hair was silver now . It used to be blond . He called it his Viking streak . His grandmother had been Danish . " I 'm sure we 'd all welcome a cocktail , " her father said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly and her mother had a glass of wine , Philip requested a martini . As her father handed it to him , he said , " Philip , how damaging was Black 's testimony today ? " Molly could hear the forced , too-hearty tone of Philip Matthews 's answer : " I think we 'll be able to neutralize it when I get a crack at him . " Philip Matthews , powerful thirty-eight-year-old defense lawyer , had become a kind of media star . Molly 's father had sworn he would get Molly the best money could buy , and that comparatively young as he was , Matthews was it . Had n't he gotten an acquittal for that broadcasting executive whose wife was murdered ? Yes , Molly thought , but they did n't find him covered with her blood . She could feel the cloudiness in her head clearing a little , although she knew it would come back . It always did . But at thi s moment she could understand the way everything must seem to the people in the courtroom , especially to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last ? " she asked . " About another three weeks , " Matthews told her . " And then I 'll be found guilty , " she said matter-of-factly . " Do you think I am ? I know that everybody else thinks I did it because I was so angry at him . " She sighed wearily . " Ninety percent of them think I 'm lying about not remembering anything , and the other ten percent think I ca n't remember that night because I 'm crazy . " Aware that they were following her , she walked down the hall to the study and pushed open the door . The sense of unreality was already closing in again . " Maybe I did do it , " she said , her voice expressionless . " That week at the Cape . I remember walking on the beach and thinking how unfair it all was . How after five years of marriage and losing the first baby and wanting another one so terribly , I 'd finally gotten pregnant again , then had a miscarriage at four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dad , because you were worried that I was so heartbroken . Then only a month after losing my child , I picked up the phone and heard Annamarie Scalli talking to Gary , and I realized she was pregnant with his child . I was so angry , and so hurt . I remember thinking that God had punished the wrong person by taking my baby . " Ann Carpenter put her arms around her daughter . This time Molly did not resist the embrace . " I 'm so scared , " she whispered . " I 'm so scared . " Philip Matthews took Walter Carpenter 's arm . " Let 's go into the library , " he said . " I think we 'd better face reality here . I think we 're going to have to consider a plea bargain . " Molly stood b efore the judge and tried to concentrate as the prosecutor spoke . Philip Matthews had told her the prosecutor reluctantly agreed to allow her to plead guilty to manslaughter , which carried a ten year sentence , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lasch 's pregnant mistress , who had not yet testified . Annamarie had told investigators that she was home alone that Sunday night . " The prosecutor knows I 'll try to throw suspicion on Annamarie , " Matthews had explained to her . " She was angry and bitter at Gary , too . We might have had a crack at a hung jury , but if you were convicted , you 'd be facing a life sentence . This way you 'll be out in as little as five . " It was her turn to say the words that were expected of her . " Your Honor , while I can not remember that horrible night , I acknowledge that the state 's evidence is strong and points to me . I accept that the evidence has shown that I killed my husband . " It 's a nightmare , Molly thought . I will wake up soon and be home and safe . Fifteen minutes later after the Judge had imposed the ten year sentence she was led away in handcuffs toward the van that would transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center . Five and a Half Years Later Gus Brandt , executive producer for the NAF Cable Network , looked up from his desk at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Manhattan . Fran Simmons , whom he 'd recently hired as an investigative reporter for the six o'clock news hour and for regular assignments to his hot new True Crime program , had just entered his office . " The word 's in , " he said excitedly . " Molly Carpenter Lasch is being paroled from prison . She gets out next week . " " She did get parole ! " Fran exclaimed . " I 'm so glad . " " I was n't sure you 'd remember the case . You were living in California six years ago . Do you know much about it ? " " Everything , actually . Do n't forget , I went to Cranden Academy in Greenwich , with Molly . I had the local papers sent to me throughout the trial . " " You went to school with her ? That 's great . I want to schedule a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . " " Sure . But Gus , do n't think I have an inside track with Molly , " Fran warned . " I have n't laid eyes on her since the summer we graduated , and that was fourteen years ago . At the same time I began U. Cal , my mother moved to Santa Barbara , and I lost touch with just about everybody in Greenwich . " There 'd actually been many reasons for both her and her mother relocating to California , leaving Connecticut as far behind as memory would allow . On the day of Fran 's graduation from the academy , her father had taken her and her mother out for a festive dinner of celebration . At the end of the meal he had toasted Fran 's future at his alma mater , kissed both of them , and then , saying that he 'd left his wallet in the car , he had gon she like ? When she was young , I mean . " Fran tucked a strand of light brown hair behind her ear , an unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image flashed through her mind , and for an instant she could see Molly as she 'd been at age sixteen , at Cranden Academy . " Molly was always special , " she said after a moment . " You 've seen her pictures . She was always a beauty . Even when the rest of us were still gawky adolescents , she was already turning heads . She had the most incredible blue eyes , almost iridescent , plus a complexion models would kill for and shimmering blond hair . But what really impressed me was that she was always so composed . I remember thinking if she met the pope and the queen of England at the same party , she 'd know how to address them and in what order . And yet , the funny part was that I always suspected that , inside , she was shy . Despite her remarkable composure , there was something tentative about her . Kind of like a beautiful bird perched at the end of a branch , poised but ready at any second to take flight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering seeing her once in an elegant gown . She looked even taller than five eight because she had such gorgeous carriage . " How friendly were you two ? " Gus queried . " Oh , I was n't really in her orbit . Molly was part of the moneyed country club set . I was a good athlete and concentrated on sports more than on social activities . I can assure you my phone was never ringing off the hook on Friday night . " " As my mother would have put it , you grew up nice , " Gus said dryly . I was never at ease at the academy , Fran thought . There are plenty of middle-class families in Greenwich , but middle class wasn ' t good enough for Dad . He was always trying to ingratiate himself with wealthy people . He wanted me to be friends with the girls who came from money or who had family connections . " Apart from her appearance , what was Molly like ? " " She was very sweet , " Fran said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had done the embezzling and the suicide and everything I was avoiding everyone . Molly knew I jogged every day , and early one morning she was waiting for me . She said she just wanted to keep me company for a while . Since her father had been one of the biggest donors to the library fund , you can imagine what her show of friendship meant to me . " " You had no reason to be ashamed because of what your father did , " Gus snapped . Fran 's tone became crisp . " I was n't ashamed of him . I was just so sorry for him and angry too , I guess . Why did he think that my mother and I needed things ? After he died , we realized how frantic he must have been in the days just before , because they were about to audit the library fund 's books , and he knew he 'd be found out . " She paused , then added softly , " He was wrong to have done all that , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think we needed it . He was weak also . I realize now he was terribly insecure . But at the same time , he was an awfully nice guy . " " So was Dr. Gary Lasch . He was a good administrator too . Lasch Hospital has a top-drawer reputation , and Remington Health Management is n't like so many of the cockamamie HMOs that are going bankrupt and leaving patients and doctors high and dry . " Gus smiled briefly . " You knew Molly and you went to school with her , so that gives you some insight . Do you think she did it ? " " " There 's no question that she did it , " Fran said promptly . " The evidence against her was overwhelming , and I 've covered enough murder trials to understand that very unlikely people ruin their lives by losing control for that one split second . Still , unless Molly changed dramatically after the time I knew her , she 'd be the last person in the world I would have said was likely to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why she might have blocked it out . " " That 's why this case is great for the program , " Gus said . " Get on it . When Molly Lasch gets out of Niantic Prison next week , I want you to be part of the reception committee welcoming her . "
