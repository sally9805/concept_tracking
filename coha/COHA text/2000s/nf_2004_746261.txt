Key words : inquiry tasks for adolescents ; problem-centered social studies ; concerns and interests of young adults <p> At least since John Dewey published his classic works ( Dewey 1916 1938 ; 1933 ; 1938 1963 ) , teachers have been urged to engage students by using thinking and inquiry tasks that reflect real-world concerns and interests . Subsequent to the appearance of Dewey 's discussions of that pedagogical stance , the National Council for the Social Studies published The Problems Approach and the Social Studies in 1955 and issued a revised version , Problem-Centered Social Studies Instruction : Approaches to Reflective Teaching , in 1971 ( Gross and Muessig 1971 ) . More recently , social science education specialists published research-based theoretical articles providing scholarly justifications for the use of inquiry activities in social studies classes , especially activities that have students using the methods of social scientists ( Mayer 1998 ; VanSickle and Hoge 1991 ) . Since 1990 , authors of numerous articles have recommended the use of problem-centered instruction in secondary social studies classes ( e.g. , Benoit 1998 ; Gallagher 2000 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hughes 1994 ) , including classes for students with learning disabilities ( O'Brien 2000 ) . During that period , other authors have recommended that for secondary social studies classes , teachers should consider a relative of problem-centered instruction  --  the case method ( Guyer , Dillon , Anderson , and Szobota 2000 ; Wasserman 1992 ) . Other social science education experts writing on the promotion of thinking and inquiry about real-world concerns and interests in secondary social studies classes have referred to " authentic instruction " ( Foster and Padgett 1999 ; Newmann 1990 ) . Still others have built their preferred methods around social issues ( Evans 1998 ; Rossi 1996 ; Shaver 1992 ) . At present , an entire book is in print on the use of cooperative problem-solving methods in secondary social studies classes ( Hickman and Wigginton 1999 ) . Another available book features the use of problem-based learning in social studies classes from the elementary grades through college ( Moye 1998 ) , and one is in print on the social issues approach ( Evans and Saxe 1996 ) . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers respond to John Dewey 's recommendation that teachers engage students by using thinking and inquiry tasks reflecting real-world concerns and interests . Challenges in Using Inquiry Methods <p> Widespread support for Dewey 's recommendation does not easily translate into widespread , sustained application of the recommendation , however . Researchers who have investigated the use of problem-centered instruction in social studies classes ( Ehman , Glenn , Johnson , and White 1992 ; Saye and Brush 1999 ) point to the time demands on students and teachers , the need for and frequent lack of relevant prior knowledge on the students ' part , and the importance of expert guidance for students during the problem-solving process , even when much guidance is built into computer-based activities . Even enthusiastic supporters of issues-oriented instruction in social studies classes point to the challenges faced by users of the approach ( Rossi 1995 ; Rossi and Pace 1998 ) . In fact , authors of recent articles focus specifically on ways to overcome barriers that discourage social studies teachers from applying inquiry methods centered on real-world concerns and interests ( Evans , Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like most of the authors cited above , we are firm believers in the use of thinking and inquiry tasks that reflect real-world concerns and interests and are committed users of such tasks in our university classrooms . Because of our interest in the method , we are disappointed to see the relative infrequency with which teachers use thinking and inquiry tasks that focus on real-world concerns and interests in secondary social studies classes . We recognize , however , that the ill-structured tasks meant to typify problem-based learning can create substantial instructional challenges for teachers . We recognize , too , that the controversial issues recommended for issues-centered instruction can create unpleasant conflict in teachers ' lives . <p> We believe , however , that many teachers can move toward the more complex forms of thinking and inquiry methods and those forms that more realistically simulate the actual work of social scientists . In many secondary social studies classes , the teachers may have to begin with thinking and inquiry tasks that are relatively modest in complexity and that perhaps require only textbook information and classroom time to carry them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do not pretend to be historians , political scientists , or psychologists . In this article , we identify several types of thinking and inquiry tasks that focus on concerns or interests of adolescents but do so at varying levels of complexity and require students to use a range of informational resources . The types of tasks discussed are less complex than the ill-structured tasks recommended by proponents of problem-based learning and the case method , and the tasks put less demand on the thinking and investigation skills of students than the tasks typical of those two instructional approaches or of issues-centered instruction . <p> To begin our discussion , we must emphasize a fact of which veteran secondary teachers are fully aware : Anticipating whether a certain thinking or inquiry task will tap into a concern or interest of a specific adolescent is virtually impossible without knowing the individual very well . The available research on the concerns and interests of young adults may be reassuring for social studies teachers who have incorrectly predicted the effectiveness of a creatively constructed thinking or inquiry task with a certain secondary student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , that the typical concerns and interests of young adults vary with their age ( Hendry , Glendinning , and Shucksmith 1996 ) , the influence of their parents and socioeconomic status ( Kasser , Ryan , Zax , and Sameroff 1995 ) , and societal circumstances ( Easterlin and Crimmins 1991 ; Ovadia 2003 ) . In short , no simple , unchanging guidelines can be developed for creating thinking and inquiry tasks that can reliably capitalize on concerns of specific secondary students . To design such tasks , teachers must draw on what they can learn about individual students and about specific groups of students . Tasks Reflecting Students ' Concerns and Interests <p> Despite that caveat , we present in figure 1 several types of tasks that can take advantage of the concerns or interests of adolescents . To understand the information in figure 1 fully , the reader must refer to the appendix of this article . We drew on our experiences with secondary students to identify the types of tasks and to construct the sample tasks illustrating those types . During the process of developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1990 ) , " The Personal Relevance of the Social Studies , " in which he offers a " personal-relevance framework " by which he categorizes typical human goals . He sorts them first into four general motivations  --  sense of security , sense of affiliation , sense of competence , and sense of influence  --  and then into five areas of life  --  human relationships , occupation , health and safety , personal development , and finances . Even after we had developed most of the suggested task types and examples , we found his framework helpful for creating additional thinking and inquiry tasks to tap into the concerns of adolescents . <p> The reader should examine the figure and the appendix before continuing with the article . We wrote the sample tasks using sentence structure and vocabulary that we assumed readers of The Social Studies would understand . For some secondary social studies classes , modifications in the sentence structure and vocabulary are needed . <p> We do not mean the types of uses of social studies content and the sample tasks that we present to be definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to illustrate the content uses on which social studies teachers can build instruction . The sample tasks need not be like academic or professional applications of course content or resemble academic or professional tasks . The tasks can have a personal use and have a high probability of being viewed as relevant to adolescents , even if the students are not concerned about the content as academic content . We are impressed by many of the thinking and inquiry tasks suggested in the teacher 's edition of current secondary social studies textbooks , but we find that most of the tasks involve uses that would seem realistic primarily to academic specialists in the subject area , to professionals in careers related to the subject area , or to students who are already intensely interested in the subject area . We believe that all students should be exposed to such uses but that they also should be allowed and enabled to see that social studies content can be used in ways that they recognize as relevant . Features of Effective Use of Inquiry Methods <p> We do not intend this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry tasks in secondary social studies classrooms . The articles and books we cited provide excellent discussions of that nature . We also recommend helpful articles and books with no specific subject area focus by Beamon ( 2002 ) , Fogarty ( 1997 ) , Lambros ( 2004 ) , Krynock and Robb ( 1999 ) , Renzulli ( 2000,2001 ) , Souders and Prescott ( 1999 ) , and Torp and Sage ( 2002 ) . Although we do not propose an overall framework for incorporating thinking and inquiry tasks into secondary social studies instruction , we suggest several features that are also recommended in the discussions of many experts on problem-based learning and related instructional approaches . One suggestion is that in secondary classrooms , small-group collaborative inquiry , rather than individual inquiry , often leads to better inquiry products and better learning . Collaboration usually capitalizes on the " five heads are better than one " phenomenon , which leads to high-quality inquiry products . Students in a small group can learn from others ' explanations of tasks , concepts , and larger ideas and from others ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inquiry tasks , teachers should offer options from which students can choose . For example , a teacher could include as options a selection of tasks from the teacher 's edition of the course textbook and several of the teacher-created tasks presented in this article . Allowing students to choose the tasks that they will carry out increases the chance that they will be interested in the topics , that they have the investigation skills needed for the tasks , and that they have useful prior knowledge . Those three circumstances can produce the motivation and capabilities required for successful task completion . Nevertheless , even when students work in groups on tasks involving topics of interest to them and on tasks for which they have relevant investigation skills and prior knowledge , they need to be monitored by the teacher to provide guidance and other support . <p> We believe that the successful use of thinking and inquiry tasks by a secondary social studies teacher who has not already incorporated problem-based learning , the case method , issues-centered instruction , or a related approach into her or his classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to develop the requisite management skills and procedures before considering large-scale use of one of the approaches . Moreover , the students need to develop their thinking , investigation , and collaboration skills , which are essential for successful participation in the approaches . One reason we believe in the types of thinking and inquiry tasks presented in this article is that the teacher 's and student 's skills improve through such tasks and can eventually be applied to the types of tasks typically recommended by proponents of problem-based learning , the case method , issues-centered instruction , and other inquiry approaches for social studies classes . Although the sample tasks presented here are low to moderate in complexity and in the demands placed on students ' thinking and investigation skills , the use of such types of tasks can lay the foundation for successful use of more complex and more demanding thinking and inquiry tasks .
