Lobbyists have long profited from ties to people in power . But rarely are those relationships  --  and the favors they can win  --  displayed as brazenly as they have been recently at the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs , the agency that confers federal recognition on tribes and can turn dusty reservations into billion-dollar-a-year gaming palaces . One unabashed appeal took Linda Amelia of the Chinook Indian tribe by surprise in January . Amelia saw an opportunity to advance her group 's long fight for recognition as a tribe at a California G.O.P. meeting attended by Wayne Smith , the No. 2 man at the BIA . Amelia gave Smith her business card and said she would like to discuss Chinook issues with him . Two weeks later , she got a phone call from a man named Phil Bersinger . Identifying himself as a close friend and former business partner of Smith 's , he said that for a fee he could influence decisions at the BIA . When Amelia asked how he had got her name , she says Bersinger replied , " You gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Bersinger also wrote the Chinooks a letter on " Bersinger &; Smith " stationery , from his consulting-partnership days with Smith in Sacramento , Calif . Bersinger boasted of his " tremendous access and influence " at the BIA , saying he vacations with Smith and opens his home to his old friend when Smith returns to the Sacramento area . For $1,000 a month , the letter said , he could be " extremely helpful " on the tribal-recognition issue . Bersinger 's influence peddling was so barefaced , Amelia thought it might be an FBI sting . Her tribe ultimately declined the services . " It was improper to pay for what should be rightfully ours anyway , " Amelia says . <P> The Chinooks were not the only tribe turned off by Bersinger . Sources tell TIME that in February Smith brought Bersinger to an official meeting in Sacramento with the Buena Vista Me-Wuks tribe of California . After the meeting , sources say , Bersinger approached a Buena Vista lawyer in search of tribal work . The Buena Vistas did n't hire him . Bersinger also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sought $5,000 a month in a letter sent in March . Tribal officer Tiger Paulk says of Bersinger 's pitch : " It was a shakedown . " <P> Bersinger says he may have told Smith he was soliciting Indian work but did not get Smith 's permission to use his name in marketing . " I was trying to get business , " he says . He admits to having written the letters but says his appeals were limited to Amelia 's and Paulk 's tribes . He refused to discuss how he found Amelia or what he discussed with the Buena Vista lawyer . <P> For his part , Smith acknowledges his close ties to Bersinger but says he did not know his friend was pursuing tribal business . He denies referring Bersinger to Amelia , and says Bersinger was at the Buena Vista meeting only by chance . Though he has never discussed official BIA business with Bersinger , Smith says , he has recused himself from the Chinook case and plans to do the same for the Buena Vistas .
