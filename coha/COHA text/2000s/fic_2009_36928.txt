ST . GALLEN , SWITZERLAND , AUGUST 15 <p> Lee Yuan had always been a bit of a mystic . Always had been and always would be . He saw things where other people did n't , believed things that other people laughed at . But his friends and peers accepted him for what he was , a product of his background , and his experience . <p> Right now , however , Lee Yuan was halfway around the world and completely out of luck . It was not a healthy equation for examining fading artifacts in the dungeons of an ancient stone monastery . It was not a healthy equation for anything . <p> Worse , Lee Yuan felt as if he were freezing to death . His hands worked as quickly as possible . His only light was that from a kerosene lantern , lit with a small acetylene torch . There was a little heat from the torch , but still , his fingers were nearly frostbitten . He had traveled far . This was where he had been told he would find it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sorted through artifacts , bits and pieces of ancient times , stuffed together in a decrepit old wooden box . The box was the size of a child 's coffin . It had probably been built for that purpose , constructed by hands that had been dead for many centuries . <p> Monks had lived in this dwelling since the fourteen hundreds . Who knew what else , what treasures and torments from other ages , were sealed in these gloomy walls ? <p> Well , there was only one treasure that Yuan sought . <p> Only one that anyone sought here . <p> He worked with bare fingertips that could no longer feel anything . Wool and leather covered his palms as well as much of the rest of his body ; even his head was wrapped against the cold . He could n't hear anything . <p> But he had needed dexterity in his fingertips . <p> First they had stung like the devil , the fingertips . But now , nothing . He had long since zoned out the pain , but frostbite was another matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another two minutes before he would endanger the flesh of his fingers . Once the flesh had frozen , the feeling would never return . He had seen Sherpa guides who had come back from Tibet and Mongolia with gnarled , disfigured hands that extended only to the first knuckles . <p> An ivory box . A hand-carved crucifix , Italian in origin . Maybe two and a half centuries old . His brain assimilated : from the reign of one of the Clements or Innocents . <p> Clement the Fifth . <p> Innocent the Seventh . <p> Roman popes from the Holy See . The Bishops of Rome . <p> French Anti-popes from Avignon . The self-indulgent pretenders . <p> Gregory the Eighth . <p> Ignatius the Righteous . <p> A tremendous shiver overtook Yuan and shook him violently . His spine ached . <p> Yuan the Frozen . <p> How much colder could it get ? His hands trembled . His fingers worked quickly . <p> Bone . The bone of a man or woman . All flesh long gone . It looked like a wrist bone . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inscription that was not entirely worn away . <p> Yuan had been on this search for five weeks since leaving Hong Kong . Why had he ever agreed to this ? Others could have come in his place to retrieve the artifact . He was forty-seven years old and probably not even the most qualified man that his employer could have sent . Sure , he was highly educated in Western culture , fluent in Mandarin , English , and French , deeply knowledgeable in the traditions of the Holy Roman Church , an expert on their strange procedures . <p> Send a younger man next time . <p> He continued to sift through the contents of the box . <p> A ceramic pot . A small replica of the Virgin . Splinters of wood from other objects . <p> The True Cross ? Sure . Why not ? If every splinter that Westerners had claimed to be from the True Cross were authentic , an entire mansion could be built from the splinters . What else in the box ? <p> A small urn , probably for burning incense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into small pieces , much like Yuan 's hopes . <p> Would this trip never end , this journey into oblivion ? <p> From somewhere a voice spoke to him , almost an epiphany . Careful what you wish for . <p> He wished he were back home in Asia . He thought of his wife . He wondered if she was faithful to him . He wondered how long , if he did n't return , before she took up with another man . He wondered about the younger men whom he had trained and worked with . Would they laugh at him in this final quest ? Or would they come after him to bring him home ? <p> His eyes assessed the final contents of the box . <p> A few coins . Fragments of jewelry . Little pieces of nothing . <p> Nothing . Nothing at all to justify this long trek and search . And certainly nothing mystical . Now he realized that he had been scammed . He should have demanded delivery of his prize in Zurich , or Geneva , or some sane place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been hidden ! <p> What next ? <p> His fingers could take it no more . The numbness was spreading . A bad sign . He held his fingers near his acetylene torch , almost touching the flame . He could smell the flesh thawing , or thought he could , then burning , then sudden pain . The feeling was back . <p> He pulled on the heavy gloves that hung at his side . No time for anything except to escape . He turned . He trudged across the small chamber to the base of the spiral stone stairs that had led him down to this claustrophobic place . If hell had frozen over , surely this was it . <p> He held up the lantern . He looked upward to a blackness that he had n't anticipated . He took five labored steps upward and saw what had happened . The old wooden door-his only exit-had closed . And not on its own . <p> Where had his two sentries gone ? His lookouts ? <p> He put his shoulder to the door . He pushed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door from the other side , probably the perverse old monk with the scar across the back of his hand who had led him down into this place . <p> He knocked furiously at the door . Then he kicked it . He called out . He cursed violently . <p> But he realized that he was a captive and probably no one even heard his screams . No one would come back for him for days , maybe weeks . <p> There was only one possible escape . He poured the remaining kerosene from his lamp against the lower section of the door and used his acetylene torch to try to burn it . <p> Lots of smoke . Not much fire . <p> He coughed violently . Then he realized that he had done exactly what his adversaries had hoped he would do . He would asphyxiate himself in an attempt to escape . <p> His kerosene ran out . With a final pathetic flicker , so did his torch . <p> Darkness descended with unwelcome speed . Then darkness embraced everything . <p> Not just darkness . Blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not something he would ever see again . He settled in . So did death 's messenger in a place like this : the bitter Alpine cold . <p> His mortal end arrived with astonishing ease . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
