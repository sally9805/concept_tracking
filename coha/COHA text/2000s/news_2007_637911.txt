<p> ALTOONA , Pa.  --  Robin Moore had never heard of this city in the mountains of central Pennsylvania , so far in distance and feeling from her home in Newark . <p> Compelled by a desire to stretch her dollars and find space and safety , Moore dialed a phone number she spotted on a flier in a Newark welfare office . " I always liked Pennsylvania , so I kind of took a chance with Altoona , " says Moore , 37 . <p> In March , she moved with her husband , three daughters and grandson to a public housing development here . <p> " I wanted to protect my children , " she says . " I wanted to protect my husband because in New Jersey , there 's a lot going on . This town had more of what I wanted , a little more peace . " <p> Moore 's is one of at least 16 lower-income families who in recent months moved more than 200 miles across state lines from Newark and nearby urban enclaves to Altoona , population 47,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has a back deck and mountain view , a marked change from the Newark public housing project , rife with drug dealing , where she once lived . <p> The arrival of Moore and others , along with inquiries by dozens of other New Jersey residents seeking subsidized housing here , has triggered concerns by Altoona housing officials that New Jersey is steering its poor to Pennsylvania , kindling tensions between longtime residents and the newcomers . <p> The migration is one reflection of the shortage of affordable housing in many metropolitan areas . Teachers , police officials and other middle-class workers often live far from where they work because they ca n't afford adequate housing in those communities . <p> The poor are n't much different , says Danilo Pelletiere , research director for the National Low Income Housing Coalition . <p> " More and more , it 's not so much economic opportunity , but it 's the lower housing costs " prompting poor people to move , Pelletiere says . " We have been losing low-cost rental units in most major metropolitan areas ... to condos in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even higher-priced rentals . " <p> The Altoona phenomenon is popping up elsewhere : <p> *Lancaster , Calif . Communities in the Antelope Valley have seen an influx of families from Los Angeles , 70 miles away . Their public-housing vouchers enable them to afford nicer homes than they had in the city . <p> *Columbus , Ohio . Barbara Clark , head organizer for the local chapter of the affordable-housing advocacy group ACORN , says local families use their subsidies to find homes in the suburbs . " To find a nice home , you have to move way out , " Clark says . <p> Then there 's New Jersey , which has the nation 's highest per capita property taxes and some of its most expensive housing . <p> Tory Gunsolley , spokesman for the Newark Housing Authority , says the agency did not direct local residents or applicants to Pennsylvania . But , he adds , " we certainly understand that if there are people desperate to find affordable housing , they will look beyond what Newark will provide . " <p> A curious trend <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began getting six to eight calls a day from New Jersey residents seeking applications for subsidized housing , Executive Director Cheryl Johns says . <p> She found it curious that those seeking to move here had no idea where the city was . <p> When she finally asked an applicant why she was interested in Altoona , the caller said her welfare case worker had referred her . Johns decided to take action . " When I have almost half of the people on my waiting list from the New Jersey area , it 's an issue , " Johns says . <p> She contacted a state senator whose office tracked down two fliers , posted in a Newark welfare office , that gave the phone numbers of the Altoona Housing Authority and an apartment development in Williamsport , Pa. , that accepted government rental vouchers . <p> Bruce Nigro , welfare director for Essex County , N.J. , says that once he learned of the fliers , he banned them . <p> A person who qualifies by income for subsidized housing can apply for a unit anywhere , says Donna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urban Development , but most people stay in their local communities . Of the 1.8 million families in the rental subsidy program , 7%-10% get a voucher in one area , then use it in another , she says . <p> In Altoona , roughly 20% of the population qualifies for subsidized housing based on income , Johns says . Local residents get priority . Waiting lists range from 18 months to two years . <p> " We 're not trying to discriminate against anyone , " she says , but " I 'm responsible for taking care of the residents of the city of Altoona . " <p> More drug trafficking <p> Some Altoona residents and public officials blame an increase in drug crime on recent arrivals from New Jersey and other states . <p> John Grum , 48 , says the city should not offer subsidized housing to out-of-towners " or at least get a good background check on them before they do . " Those committing many of the crimes are " from Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , New Jersey . They 're not Altoona people . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says that in the past five years , drug dealers from larger cities have moved into smaller cities such as Altoona " where they can essentially be a big fish in a small pond . " <p> Since January 2005 , he says , more than 600 street-level drug dealers have been arrested in Blair County , which includes Altoona . <p> Robin Moore says such statistics have nothing to do with her . " My daughter 's a productive member of society , " she says . " My husband is , and I am , so even if it 's just us three , that proves right there that ( not ) everybody from Jersey is ... into drugs and crime . " <p> Moore was paying $795 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in Newark when she called the Altoona authority in January 2006 . <p> She wo n't say what she pays in Altoona , but her family lives in an apartment that 's larger yet cheaper than their last home in Newark . <p> Her husband , Corey , is a groundskeeper . Moore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is looking for work and heads the tenants council in the 170-unit complex . <p> She says she knows some Altoona residents resent her presence . But sitting with her front door open , her children playing outside near picnic tables , she pays it no mind . <p> " I did n't even allow my kids to go outside when we lived in ( Newark public ) housing , though we had a playground , " she says . " The drug dealers had taken it over . ... I know what my purpose is for coming here . " <p> PHOTOS , B/W , Jeff Swensen for USA TODAY(2)
