// FIRST IN A SERIES ON REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES Postpartum depression grabs headlines , but new research shows that depression grabs headlines , but new pregnancy may be arch shows that depression during problem . Here 's what you may be an even know , By Laurer problem . Here 's what you must know . By Lauren Picker DURING MY FIRST PREGNANCY , I HAD MOMENTS OF MISERY nausea , heartburn , worries about the baby 's health  --  but I was also filled with joy . I 'd practically skip to my obstetrician 's office , knowing I would hear the baby 's heartbeat . Frankly , I could n't wait to get pregnant again and envisioned six months ( this time I had no illusions about the first three ) as a glowing Madonna with a lovely rounded belly . Instead , I felt as if I 'd been hit with a sledgehammer . I spent much of my second pregnancy anxious and sad . I felt disconnected from the baby , joyless and hollow , and worried that I 'd made a terrible mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was as if I were moving through molasses , slow and lethargic , the air thick around me . I had a vague sense of wanting my obstetrician to save me-from what , I was n't quite sure . But I did n't let on to anyone just how down I really was . I already felt guilty , and I could n't bear to see the accusations I leveled against myself reflected in others ' eyes . What kind of mother was I ? What was wrong with me ? As it turns out , I was depressed . The Last Skeleton Welcome to pregnancy 's best-kept secret . Nine percent of pregnant women meet the diagnostic criteria for clinical depression . Factor in those with " mild " symptoms-people like me-and experts estimate that the number at least doubles . In fact , a recent study in the British Medical Journal found that prenatal depression ( also known as antenatal depression ) may actually be more prevalent than its postpartum cousin , which rates its own chapter in books on pregnancy and grabs headlines , as with last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of postpartum depression , she 's confessed to drowning her five children . Depression during pregnancy can be just as tragic : Some depressed women have aborted their babies , babies they wanted , because they became so overwhelmed by their symptoms . Others have even considered suicide . " We tend to think of pregnancy as a time of emotional well-being , " says Ruta Nonacs , Ph.D. , a perinatal psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . " But it is n't for all women . " When we posted a question about prenatal depression on Redbook 's website , women were eager to unload . " I 'm currently six months pregnant , and I 've never experienced such lows , " writes one 22-year-old Atlanta woman . " When I was pregnant for the third time , I got so depressed I did n't even want to have the baby , " says a 28-year-old Lawton , Oklahoma mother of three . " I cried day and night the entire nine months , " recalls Marilyn Gonzalez , a 29-year-old mom in New York . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there I would go , crying . I can joke about it now , but I 'm really afraid to ever get pregnant again . " The Code of Silence Unless you ask , however , most women keep their anguish under wraps . The truth is , we live in a society that makes it hard for women to acknowledge pregnancy as anything but a joyous prelude to motherhood . Blame the stigma that still clings to depression in general . But also blame our unrealistic expectations about what pregnancy should be . " When a pregnancy is not going as happily as expected , a woman starts to see herself as weak and defective or not measuring up . There 's a lot of societal and personal pressure not to talk about anything short of bliss , " says Diane G. Sanford , Ph.D. , a St. Louis psychologist specializing in prenatal and postpartum depression . Take Ariel Jensen-Vargas , who started having mood swings last year , during her second pregnancy . " In our entire five years together , my husband had probably seen me cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Emily , he saw me cry two or three times a week , " she says . " I 'm sure he was wondering , Who is this woman ? " But the question went unasked : " He was supportive in general , but he never talked about how I was feeling . He just said I had to be strong , which was pretty useless advice , " she says . It does n't help that many of depression 's symptoms mimic those of pregnancy , making it hard for women-who are expecting some emotional ups and downs-to recognize what 's " normal " and what 's not ( see " Are You Depressed ... or Just Pregnant ? " below ) . " Especially in the first pregnancy , women are often told that mood symptoms are common , " says Katherine L. Wisner , M.D. , M.S. , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Louisville in Kentucky and a prominent researcher in the field . Ariel Jensen-Vargas 's mood swings quickly moved beyond the symptoms described in that pregnancy bible , What to Expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , the 36-year-old had an argument with her sister-in-law and flew into a rage . " I took a frying pan and just started whacking the stove with it , " says the New York mother of two . " I spilled the eggs I was making , " she says . " It was a big mess , and there I was , on the floor , sobbing , cleaning them up . " No one said anything-her stunned husband offered to make the eggs-and Jensen-Vargas later blamed the moment on hormones . A month afterward she started crying and could n't stop for 12 hours . " I could n't get ahold of myself , " she says . " I felt like pieces of me were floating around . " And toward the end of her pregnancy , Jensen-Vargas withdrew , always sitting by herself when she took her young son to the playground . " I told my doctor I was having a tough time , " she says , " but I did n't tell her about the crying and stuff . " As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state to their ob/gyns . " They often hide their sadness because they feel a sense of shame , " says Margaret Howard , Ph.D. , clinical director of a treatment program for prenatal and postpartum depression at Women &; Infants ' Hospital in Providence . " Even severely depressed women will put on a happy face when they see their doctor . " Photograph Heather Go at 28 with Ma months . : 11 Ariel Jensen  --  Vargas at 36 with Anthony , 3 , and Emily , 2 days . Karen Peterson at 38 with Caroline , 3. // And as if depressed moms-to-be do n't feel isolated enough , doctors do n't do much to draw them out . " The focus at ob/gyn appointments is on physical rather than emotional health , " explains Sanford . In fact , research shows that only 12 percent of obstetricians ask about their patients ' emotional state . Even when the subject does come up , there 's no guarantee depressed women will get the help they need . Fewer than a quarter of ob/gyns actually refer these women to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Jensen-Vargas . " But it 's boom , you get your urine tested , your blood pressure , weight , and measurements checked , you hear the heartbeat , and it 's good-bye . " Bad for Baby , Bad for Mom This don't-ask-don't-tell attitude can have dire consequences for expectant mothers and their babies . " Some women get so depressed during their first trimester , they end up terminating , " says Nonacs . And though it 's extremely rare for a pregnant woman to actually kill herself , some do try it . One 25-year-old in British Columbia attempted suicide last winter , at the end of her first trimester The woman 's mother saw her standing on the riverbank and grabbed her before she leapt into the frigid water . " She said , " Do n't stop me . I want to kill myself . I 'm hearing voices telling me to do this , " ' says Shaila Misri , M.D. , ER.C.RC. , a professor of psychiatry and ob/gyn at the University of British Columbia who is now treating the woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , since the birth of her first child . When she became pregnant again , very severe depression , which included psychotic features , set in . " Even when the situation is n't lifethreatening , depression is too serious to ignore . Depressed moms-to-be are more likely than others to neglect their own health , eating poorly and , in some cases , self-medicating with drugs and alcohol . A growing body of research shows that the babies of depressed mothers are at higher risk for low birth weight and premature delivery . Other studies show that a mother 's depression may have an effect on her baby 's development and ability to learn . It may also hinder her relationship with her child after delivery . " Bonding does n't begin at birth , " says Misri , who is also director of the reproductive mental health program at BC Women 's Hospital and St. Paul 's Hospital in Vancouver . " It begins in utero . " AFTER THE BIRTH My depression dissipated in the weeks after my son was born . But it took me much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my daughter . Nearly two years later , I 'm completely smitten with my little boy , but the experience left a scar . Recently , as I drove past my ob/gyn 's office , I was overwhelmed by a sickly sadness-the very same feeling that had shadowed my pregnancy . All in all , though , I 'm lucky . The shadows do n't always lift once pregnancy 's over . " One of the things we know is , if you stay depressed during pregnancy , you have a one-in-two chance of being depressed postpartum , " says Sanford . That 's what happened to Karen Peterson , now a 40-year-old mother of three . The outdoorsy , athletic scientist had always imagined that she and her husband would have a houseful of kids , and her first pregnancy was a happy one : " I thought I could conquer the world , " says Peterson , who lives in Potomac , Maryland . But her second pregnancy , six years later , turned into a nightmare . " I could n't wait until the second trimester to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It just got harder and harder to do simple things , " she says . Peterson chalked the symptoms up to " hormones " and slogged on , believing that things would get better after the baby was born . Instead her low mood bloomed into a crippling postpartum depression . When her daughter was 4 months old , Peterson 's anguish culminated in one terrifying moment when she was standing on a second-floor terrace : " Suddenly I thought , It would be so easy to just let go , " she says . " Things would be a lot better for everyone if I were n't here . " That one brief suicidal thought jolted her into action . With psychotherapy and after 14 months on antidepressants , Peterson began to recover her equilibrium . Knowing the warning signs-and that she could get help if she needed it  --  gave her the courage to get pregnant again . She gave birth to her third child two years ago , and this time , she says , " I did n't need antidepressants , and I did n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped it would be . " As in Peterson 's case , for many women the full weight of depression does n't strike until after delivery . " Some start having thoughts about hurting the baby or themselves , and the overwhelming anxiety that causes makes women highly dysfunctional , " says Misri . " I recently ran across a case in which a woman drowned her 9  --  month-old baby in the tub ; she had become depressed while pregnant . " And though infanticide is rare , says Misri , mothers with untreated depression are at high risk for neglecting and , yes , even abusing their children . WHY IT HAPPENS The medical community does n't yet understand why one woman coasts through pregnancy while another feels as if she 's drowning in it . But the fact that pregnancy can be marked by sadness should n't be all that surprising . Women are almost twice as likely as men to experience clinical depression , most often between the ages of 25 and 44-the childbearing years . The primary risk factor for prenatal depression is that you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are prone to depression , pregnancy may trigger it , " says Raphael S. Good , M.D. , clinical professor of psychiatry and obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Miami School of Medicine . Family history was probably at work in the case of Heather Grossguth , 28 , whose sister suffers from bipolar disorder . In her second trimester , the Warwick , Rhode Island woman was always exhausted , cried constantly , and yelled at her husband with little provocation  --  all behaviors that were strikingly similar to her sister 's . Still , she did n't see that until her mother pointed it out . " I worried that I might get depressed after the baby was born , " Grossguth says , " but it just never crossed my mind that I could get depressed during the pregnancy . " But you do n't have to be genetically wired for depression to sink into it : Sometimes hormones are the culprit . During pregnancy the mood-dampening hormone progesterone and the mood  --  elevating hormone estrogen surge from 100 to 1,000 times their normal levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jags we 're warned about . But by and large , women can handle the fluctuations , unless they 're among an unlucky few . " For a small percentage , these changes cause anxiety , depression , or a combination of both , " says Misri . Adds Dr. Nonacs : " These are the women who try oral contraceptives and have horrible depression . " In the absence of biological causes , things get a little murkier . While age and the number of times a woman has been pregnant do n't seem to play a role , stress clearly does . Pregnancy can be an emotionally trying time , and experts agree that a complicated mix of factors can put moms-to-be at risk . " Having a lot of stressors , particularly ambivalence about the pregnancy or conflict with the father , can push a woman over the edge from being sad and disgruntled into a case of fullblown depression , " says Howard , whose program at Women &; Infants ' Hospital is at at the forefront of treating women with postpartum and prenatal depression . Pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are particularly concerned about weight gain . " One 's waistline does expand , " says Howard . " For a lot of women , this is really tough . " And as with any life transition , the passage to parenthood can sharpen emotional pain that 's been dulled by time . " We 've had a couple of women in the program whose mother or father has died , " says Howard . " They talk about the devastating loss they feel that their parent wo n't know the baby , and that the baby wo n't have them as a grandparent . Pregnancy can stir up losses and trauma that need to be dealt with . " DIGGING OUT In some cases , airing our emotional baggage-finally talking about our most guilty feelings-may do the trick . In a recent Australian study confirming that women are more depressed prenatally than postpartum , the authors were hardpressed to explain why the symptoms of the women studied subsided over the course of their pregnancies . Then it hit them : Every woman had had three oneon-one conversations with experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that eased their pain . In other cases , treatment by a psychotherapist is necessary . " It 's healing for women to have another person bear witness to their pain , anguish , anxiety , and confusion . They also learn specific coping skills and techniques for managing their thoughts , " says Howard . New research shows that a kind of psychotherapy that focuses on the here and now-as opposed to delving into a woman 's past-can be especially helpful for pregnant women coping with problems such as conflict in their marriages . In the Women &; Infants ' Hospital program , patients receive a combination of group , individual , and couples therapy ( and drugs , if needed ) . They talk about their experiences , learn about depression , and acquire coping skills from anger management to relaxation . " Irritability and anger are a big component of depression , and many women who are depressed do n't know how to relax , " explains Howard . The treatment may soon introduce bright-light therapy ; a recent pilot study found that this treatment , developed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pregnancy-related depression . But until such natural alternatives are studied further , most experts will continue to recommend drug therapy , along with psychotherapy , for treating severe and sometimes even moderate cases of prenatal depression . In an era when pregnant women are frowned upon for so much as drinking a cup of coffee , however , it 's not always an easy sell . Whitney Scott* , 30 , admits that the Prozac she used during her pregnancy helped her dig herself out of a " black hole . " But the stigma is so great , she refused to use her real name in this story . Normally a happy and energetic woman , Scott realized she was in trouble during a hike with her husband in the Tennessee Valley , near San Francisco , where they live . " The two of us were walking and talking about the baby . I was in this beautiful place , and it was all really ugly to me , " says Scott . Her sister-in-law helped her track down a therapist who specializes in prenatal depression , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her husband , friends , and family , Scott felt her depression start to lift . By the time her baby was born ( a healthy five-pound girl ) , she felt like her old self-with a new appreciation for the people in her life who helped her pull through . Several months later she took the same hike with her " new mothers " group . " We all had our babies in the Baby  --  Bjorns , talking and hiking , " she says . " It was n't until I got home that it occurred to me : Oh , my God , I just went back to the Tennessee Valley-and it was beautiful . " There 's no definitive proof that any antidepressant is safe during pregnancy , but many women who have used fluoxetine ( Prozac ) and even older antidepressants during pregnancy have gone on to deliver healthy babies . A review of studies published since 1993 tracking pregnant women who took various kinds of antidepressants found no increased risk for intrauterine death or for major birth defects . Researchers also found no behavioral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children who were n't exposed . That 's not to say that taking antidepressants during pregnancy is risk-free . Research shows that babies of women who took fluoxetine were more than twice as likely to have three or more minor abnormalities , such as eyes that are spaced either closer together or farther apart than average . " These are subtle things that are most noticeable to people with measuring tapes , " says University of Louisville 's Wisner . Infants exposed to fluoxetine in the third trimester also had lower birth weights . Many experts consider these effects minor when measured against the hazards of forgoing treatment . Each woman needs to be evaluated , says Margaret Spinelli , M.D. , an assistant professor of psychiatry at Columbia University who studies depression during pregnancy . " You have to ask : What are the risks if I give medicine ? What are the risks if I do n't ? " The one question we do n't have to weigh , though , is whether it 's risky to ignore this disease . The answer is an unequivocal yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have severe mood disturbances , " says Catherine Monk , Ph.D. , an assistant professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University who studies depression and stress during pregnancy . " It 's time for all of us-doctors , mental-health professionals , women  --  to treat it as a serious , pregnancy-related condition , like diabetes or hypertension . It 's time to bring it out of the closet . " Sidebar ARE YOU DEPRESSED ... or just pregnant ?
