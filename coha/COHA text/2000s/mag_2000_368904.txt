Halloween may be a gay high Holy Day in Greenwich Village , but it was business as usual on the Toronto set of Queer as Folk . O.K. , almost as usual . Amid various cross-dressers and naughty priests , there was a crew guy outfitted in a spangly cowboy outfit , an assistant director dressed like Cher and actresses Thea Gill and Michelle Clunie  --  fresh from filming a lesbian love scene  --  tricked out as " Texas hookers " with red feather boas . Then there was the pumpkin-carving contest , including one jolly squash accessorized with a ... well , put it this way : it 's not a banana , and the pumpkin is happy to see you . <P> " It 's all about sex , " says gay-boy-next-door Michael ( Hal Sparks ) in QAF 's two-hour pilot ( Showtime , Sundays , 10 p.m. , starting Dec. 3 ) . That is an exaggeration , but just barely . This adaptation of the controversial 1999 British cult hit series about a group of young gay friends is also about challenging gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But mostly it 's about sex . The adrenaline-charged opening begins in a pheromone-drenched disco on Pittsburgh 's gay mecca , Liberty Avenue , then hurtles at 200 beats a minute into an outre lust scene between 29-year-old rake Brian ( Gale Harold ) and Justin ( Randy Harrison ) , a kid of 17  --  count ' em , 17  --  years . No conveniently arranged sheets , no angst , no kisses shot from the back : in 10 hot minutes , QAF opens the closet of gay TV sexuality and chucks in a neon stick of dynamite . <P> " There are more gay characters on TV now , but they 're mostly clowns or eunuchs , " says Ron Cowen , who executive produces the show and co-wrote the pilot with his life partner , Daniel Lipman . The two have battled the networks to get gay characters on the air since they wrote the Emmy-winning An Early Frost , the first TV movie about aids , back in 1985 . When they created NBC 's Sisters in 1991 , says Lipman , they tried unsuccessfully to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted by the British QAF 's " unapologetic " attitude  --  about things like drug use in the gay community and the fact that gay teens , like straight ones , get horny , sometimes for older men . " I do n't look at Justin as a child , " Lipman says . " He 's the predator , not Brian . " <P> The British series was the brainchild of Russell T. Davies , who based it on the lives of his friends in gritty Manchester . ( The title comes from the saying " There 's naught so queer as folk "  --  there 's nothing as strange as people . ) Davies took heat from conservatives and from gays , who called it defamatory and unrealistic . " It 's realistic for men who live like that , " he argues . " It 's not realistic for everyone . " Cowen calls such criticism " internalized homophobia .

The network set up a new subscription number  --  1-800-COMING-OUT  --  and distributed " premiere party kits " to gay and lesbian college groups . ( Though one hopes any self-respecting homosexual would take a pass on party tips from a TV company. )
