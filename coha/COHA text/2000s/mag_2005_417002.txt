Exploring the Aluminum/Alzheimer 's Link // In natural health circles , many people are tossing aluminum pans and using holistic underarm crystals instead of conventional antiperspirant . Their choices are fueled by an ongoing mystery surrounding aluminum . About 20 years ago , scientists first raised questions about a possible link between aluminum and Alzheimer 's disease . Since then , researchers have gone back and forth on this question . As soon as one publishes a study showing a connection , another disproves it . These days , most of the top medical experts , from the Mayo Clinic to the Alzheimer 's Association , say there really is no reason to panic . // But other agencies , including the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ( NIEHS ) , continue to look into it because aluminum is so ubiquitous in our daily lives . We swallow it in foods like processed cheese and baked goods . Babies encounter it in formula , breast milk and vaccines . Since aluminum is both strong and lightweight , more auto manufacturers are relying on it to boost fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , water and , ultimately , the landfills . " The Alzheimer 's risk with aluminum has n't been well defined , " says Robert Yokel , a University of Kentucky pharmacy professor who is studying aluminum for the NIEHS . " You have to weigh risks and benefits . My personal opinion is if you can make simple choices to avoid it until we sort this thing out , why not ? " One certainty is that Alzheimer 's dis ease is not going away . As the baby boom generation ages and more Americans live longer , this devastating illness is affecting more patients and their families . Currently , about five percent of people over age 60 will develop Alzheimer 's disease . Some research shows a relationship between aluminum and other nervoussystem disorders , such as Lou Gehrig 's disease and Parkinsons Disease . Pros and Cons Scientists first became aware of aluminum 's potential health risks 20 years ago , when a group of kidney patients came down with a similar form of dementia after being exposed to aluminum through dialysis . Another study found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's patients ' brains . Meanwhile , a few epidemiological studies found that people with a high level of aluminum in their drinking water had a higher incidence of Alzheimer 's . Other studies that followed , however , did not show the same correlation . Studies of cultures that drink large amounts of tea ( which leaches a lot of aluminum ) also did not show a link . After several decades , scientists have been unable to replicate the original studies showing aluminum deposits in a brain affected by Alzheimer 's . " There was an aluminum scare 20 years ago , but it now looks like there is no connection , " says Harvard Alzheimer 's researcher Dr. Ashley Bush . New research , by Bush and others , shows Alzheimer 's to be a much more complex illness than anyone had imagined . Bush 's laboratory is developing a promising new drug that prevents zinc from reacting with the proteins that form the abnormal deposits in brains attacked by Alzheimer 's . Phase III clinical trials of the drug , developed by Prana Biotech ( www.pranabio.com ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum does appear in an Alzheimer 's brain , it 's simply because it is so common in our environment . " It 's a major component of the Earth 's crust , so it shows up everywhere , " Bush says . As for food and water contamination , aluminum probably is n't much of a threat because most of it passes right through the intestines without being absorbed . Some natural health advocates disagree with this position . Suzan Walter is president of the American Holistic Health Association , and her mother died of Alzheimer 's . She says many natural health experts advise patients to avoid aluminum based on the precautionary principle , and she takes steps to avoid it in her personal life . " We do n't know what causes Alzheimer 's , but why not stay away from aluminum just in case ? " Walter asks . " It does n't compromise my life to avoid it and it ca n't hurt . " Paul Schwarte , national policy coordinator for Clean Water Action , adds , " There is a valid concern to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not definitive . " Aluminum in Food and Medicine While the metal is not easily absorbed , the government is still paying scientists like Yokel to make sure we are safe when it comes to dietary sources of aluminum . Currently , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not limit aluminum in food because it is " generally recognized as safe . " At the same time , no one knows the exact rate the body absorbs aluminum from food . Since food accounts for 95 percent of our aluminum intake , it 's worth examining , Yokel says . " We 're looking into whether this constant exposure in our diet is causing a problem , " Yokel says . Yokel is also studying the rate of absorption for aluminum in drinking water . For years , municipal water treatment operators have added aluminum to their tanks to make bacteria settle out of the final product . If Yokel 's ongoing experiments show our bodies absorb too much aluminum from tap water , the EPA may adopt stricter regulations . Aluminum is so common that all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all mothers have traces of aluminum in their breast milk ( about 40 micrograms per liter ) . Infant formula has about five times as much aluminum as breast milk ( soy formula has the most ) . And the load just builds from there as a person ages . " If aluminum does cause Alzheimer 's , it 's possible that lifelong exposure could contribute , " Yokel says . " Sometime later in life , you could hit that threshold and develop a problem-but it 's all speculation at this point . " Certain over-the-counter medicines are loaded with aluminum . For example , the World Health Organization estimates antacid users swallow as much as five grams of aluminum per day . Buffered aspirin also has aluminum . Vaccines are another little-known source of aluminum in our lives . The media has focused a great deal on mercury in childhood vaccines . But many vaccines also contain aluminum as an additive . That may be a concern because the body absorbs injected aluminum more easily . Vaccine critics also question whether mercury and aluminum might have a synergistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part of vaccines , however , because it makes them work better , says Dr. Paul OfHt , chief of infectious diseases at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia . " It 's used when you want to enhance the immune response , " Offit says . The Hepatitis B , tetanus and DPT vaccines contain aluminum , as do some batches of the flu shot . Some parent groups , such as the Virginia-based National Vaccine Information Center , have been critical of the government 's childhood vaccine policies . They argue medical policy makers and drug companies should offer vaccines without additives like mercury and aluminum . While most childhood vaccines no longer contain mercury , aluminum might be harder to replace , says FDA spokesperson Lenore Gelb . So far , no one has identified a safe alternative that can perform the same way . Even if researchers find a new substance , the testing and approval process would take years , she adds . In pockets of the country , fears about these additives are causing an anti-vaccine backlash . Some parents are home schooling their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients who might skip their flu shot because they do n't want an extra load of aluminum in their brains ? Offit believes the immediate benefits of vaccines outweigh any future risks . Right now , we have no definite proof that aluminum causes Alzheimer 's , Offit argues . But each year , thousands of children and elderly people die of flu complications . " There is nothing theoretical about the flu , " he says . What About Antiperspirants ? Adults and teens who use antiperspirant every morning get another daily dose of aluminum . While the skin absorbs a very small percentage of the aluminum in antiperspirants , studies show , natural health advocates raise questions about the effects of constant exposure . Antiperspirants work by plugging sweat glands with aluminum salts . Plenty of herbal alternatives are on the market at health food stores . But Yokel encourages shoppers to do their homework . A check of the label on one brand of crystal deodorant stone showed " alum " in the ingredients . That , Yokel advises , is simply a natural form of aluminum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aluminum-free as long as it does n't say " antiperspirant " on the label . <p>
