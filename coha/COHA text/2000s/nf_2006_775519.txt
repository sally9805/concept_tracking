ONE // My Marion // I was an adult before I ever saw the picture . But even as a girl , I knew there ? d been a lynching in Marion , Indiana . That was my father ? s hometown . And on one of many trips to visit my grandparents , I heard the family story : the night it happened back in 1930 , someone called the house and spoke to my grandfather , whose shift at the post office began at three in the morning . " Don ? t walk through the courthouse square tonight on your way to work , " the caller said . " You might see something you don ? t want to see . " Apparently that was the punchline  --  which puzzled me . Something you don ? t want to see . Then laughter . // I now know that , in the 1920s , Indiana had more Ku Klux Klan members than any other state in the union  --  from a quarter to a half million members  --  and my grandfather was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? t assimilate it into the frail Grandpa I ? d known . Couldn ? t assimilate it at all and , for a long time , didn ? t try . He was an intensely secretive man , and certainly there had been other obfuscations . He always said , for example , that he was an orphan , that his parents had died when he was three . I accepted this , but the grown-ups knew better . After Grandpa ? s funeral , my father discovered a safe deposit box and hoped at last to find a clue to the family tree . Instead he unearthed this other secret : a Klan membership card . All my father said later was " I never saw a hooded sheet . He ? d go out . We never knew where he was going . " // Much of this story is about shame . My grandfather was illegitimate , a fact that someone born in small-town Indiana in 1886 would rather die than discuss . And so he did . But if that particular humiliation seems foreign today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are white come from something we would rather not discuss . " That ? s in the past , " we like to say , as if that did anything but give us another hood to wear . // I was in my late twenties when I first came upon the lynching photo in a book : two black men in bloody tattered clothing hang from a tree , and below them stand the grinning , gloating , proud , and pleased white folks . I couldn ? t believe that this was my Marion , the lynching referred to in my family , a tree I ? d walked past as a child . I looked anxiously for my grandfather ? s face in that photo . Didn ? t find it . That was some relief . But he too had gone to the square that night . There ? d been something you don ? t want to see . Then laughter . And as I began to tell people this story , that was one detail I left out , because it shamed me : there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I loved the town . And one thing I loved most was the fact that it had a past , unlike the various midwestern suburbs where I grew up . Directly in front of my grandparents ? house  --  tall , dark green clapboard with a black stone porch  --  stood an iron hitching post , a black horse ? s head with a ring through its nose . It was no decoration . They ? d just never taken it down . They lived with history . And every visit gave me a chance to ask Grandma for the family stories , to page with her through the family album . Somehow I never noticed that all the stories and pictures were my grandmother ? s . My grandfather had none . // During one summer vacation when I was nine or ten , I found a brittle yellow newspaper clipping in a desk drawer at my grandparents ? house . The headline said josie carr , and parts of certain lines had been cut out with a razor blade . I walked it into the living room asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one said anything , but Grandpa took the clipping from my hand and left the room . Someone explained then that Josie was his mother . I had just found her obituary . We ? d been told that she had died about 1890 " from tuberculosis . " Or perhaps she had died " from grief , " said Aunt Ruth , my father ? s sister , who liked brooding on the mystery . For all those years my grandfather kept the obituary , certain facts trimmed out with a razor blade . Then that day he took it from my hand , and no one ever saw it again . // We didn ? t know who Grandpa ? s father was or why he abandoned Josie . Nor did we know when she died , what killed her , where she was buried  --  nothing . My grandmother knew everything , of course . But she said , " We don ? t talk about it . It makes your grandpa feel very bad . " So we waited till my grandparents were out of earshot before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tintypes from the old beige Nabisco box . Many of those pictured were strangers to us . Uncle Rad ? Aunt Pet ? We couldn ? t ask Grandpa . We relied on Aunt Ruth to find the images of Grandpa ? s mother : " This is Josie before the tragedy . This is Josie after the tragedy . " Aunt Ruth showed us in the later picture where clumps of Josie ? s hair had fallen out . " Maybe someone poisoned her , " my aunt mused . " Maybe someone was trying to get rid of her . " // Aunt Ruth held both possessions of Josie ? s that came down to us . One was a locket with a handsome young man ? s picture , a date  --  February 11 , 1883  --  and the words " All twisted up . N " Or was it W ? Or H ? The other was a letter in different handwriting addressed to " Josie kind Josie " from a P.W.H. , Bluffton , Indiana  --  October 28 , 1885 . A letter full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write you . " Why had this one letter been saved ? She must have received it around the time she became pregnant . My grandpa was born in July 1886. // My aunt was both guardian of these artifacts and the one who most needed to know what they meant . She had a recurring dream about the family mystery  --  that she and Grandpa were in a mausoleum , watching someone pull out a casket . In real life , of course , Grandpa did his grieving alone . My father and my aunt recalled from childhood that on every Memorial Day he rode the interurban to Gas City , just south of Marion , taking three geraniums to the cemetery . We guessed that Josie must be buried there . He , of course , never said . // Aunt Ruth would tell us the story about applying for a job in a Marion furniture store , how Grandma had warned her , " They ? ll only want to talk to you about your family . " And sure enough , the man interviewing her said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather is ? " // Then Aunt Ruth would recount the words of her long-dead auntie Mame : " Could you ever forgive us for what we did ? " But Aunt Ruth never knew who " us " referred to or why they needed her forgiveness . " I guess I was brought up not to ask questions , " she said . // We had a drawing my grandfather did as a child  --  a palatial sort of Victorian mansion . At the bottom he had signed his initials : E.R. His name was Earl Carr . He ? d taken his mother ? s last name . But clearly he ? d known from boyhood who his father was , and he ? d imagined taking that identity . Young Mister R. // Finally on his deathbed Grandpa told us , " They cheated me . I could have had ten thousand dollars . " That was all he ever said about his secret : They cheated me. // This is Josie before the tragedy . This is Josie after the tragedy . My grandpa was the tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is paying for this sin in sad eyes three years old . He was raised by Josie ? s mother , his grandma Carr , who ran a boardinghouse in Marion at 18th and Adams . As a boy , my grandfather sat on the lap of the star boarder , Eugene Debs , the great American socialist who organized on behalf of railroad workers . Grandpa loved Debs enough to name my father after him . But he said very little about his childhood . I picked up hints that the grandmother who had raised him was less than kind . // He was always so quiet , so remote . It was part of the family lore : he had never smiled in one photograph in all of his life . He hated cars and never learned to drive . I don ? t think he liked what the world had turned into . He took long walks for recreation , one time all the way to Jonesboro and back . Twenty miles . He never let my grandmother have any money and did all the grocery shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fry , the fatty cuts of meat . He would get up at two a.m. to be at work by three . He worked at the Marion Post Office from 1908 to 1956 . There he accumulated a record one thousand days of sick time and gave it back to the government . " To act tough , " said Aunt Ruth . // For a hobby he studied railroad timetables and knew which trains rode on what tracks , every track in America . A little rack of timetables sat next to his favorite chair . I used to see him study , then refold them . He was always walking to the tracks to see a train . I often wondered why he hadn ? t worked for the railroad , why he hadn ? t simply hopped one of those trains and left Marion . I think he felt obligated to the family that hadn ? t abandoned him . And what I finally understood was that he would not take a risk . // Grandpa wore a necktie and long-sleeve dress shirt with cufflinks every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He owned a single necktie and would wear it till it wore out before he bought another . Such peculiarities made him a figure of intense interest to me as a girl . The way the pleasures had been carefully measured out . Every year he took the family on the same vacation : one day in either Cleveland or Chicago to window-shop and ride the elevated . If we offered him an iced tea or juice , he would specify just how much . " Two fingers , " he ? d say . Maybe three . He was a teetotaler who did not allow liquor in the house . Every now and then he made us kids some little milk shakes , served in jelly jars . // He had one living relative , his cousin . We called her Great Aunt Catherine , and I remember how very old she was , how very old her dog , how steep the stair leading up to the ancient house . She had been to Josie ? s funeral when she was maybe three  --  so Aunt Ruth said  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . // Great Aunt Catherine had been like a sister to Grandpa . He dropped out of school after eighth grade to work for Catherine ? s father , his Uncle On . That ? s how I heard the name , though really his name was Alonzo or Lon . I liked having someone in the family named On . He was Josie ? s brother and ran a grocery store in downtown Marion . He ? s the one who said of Josie : " When all the other girls were riding sidesaddle , she rode astride and her hair blew in the wind . " It ? s the only thing anyone remembers that anyone said of her . // Aunt Ruth didn ? t even know her grandmother ? s name till she went to see a fortune-teller during World War II , and the fortune-teller said , " I get a Jo or a Josie . " So Aunt Ruth reported this to one of the relatives , who snorted , " Oh , she mentioned that one , did she ? " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandpa became a grandpa , as he stooped ever lower with Parkinson ? s disease till he was bent nearly double . He shook uncontrollably , and his spine curved . All twisted up . This is Josie before the tragedy . This is Josie after the tragedy . Soon there would be no one who remembered the tragedy . // When Grandpa died , I was seventeen , old enough to see how not-knowing had hurt my father and my aunt . What if my grandfather had realized that , decades after his death , his silence would still reverberate in all of us ? I ? m not sure even that would have moved him . As he lay dying , I remembered how I ? d found that obituary , thus ensuring the loss of our only real clue . I hoped that my grandpa would speak , but all he ever told us was , They cheated me . Lying there in the hospital , he was no different than he ? d ever been . Born old in the other century , already a tiny shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had that life for proof , that you could die and still not fix it . And as I grew older , I saw that this , in fact , was the usual story : A life of things unfixed . A whole history of things unfixed. // My father felt free to look for the truth after my grandpa died . It was 1967 . For a while he drove to Grant County every weekend , searching for Josie . He never found her . Cemeteries didn ? t always keep records in the old days , he ? d tell us . Hardly anyone bothered with death certificates . No one knew when she died  --  or for that matter , when she ? d been born . My father found no evidence that she ? d ever existed . But it had been there in that clipping , the one cut with a razor blade . My father went to all the little newspapers to look at back issues , but there was no obituary for Josie Carr . In a Gas City graveyard , he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , their names on two sides of the obelisk that marked the plot . We speculated that Josie was there too but unmarked . My father checked all the cemeteries . He talked about getting caretakers to stick long steel rods in the ground . He explained that if they hit an air pocket , a body had been there once , in a pine box  --  both turned to nothing now . " Might have been her , " my dad would say . I didn ? t ask him how he ? d know the right air . He wasn ? t really looking for the dust she ? d become . He wanted her story . And if he got just the very last page  --  the scene with the preacher ? s incantation and the coffin lifted slowly from the back of a wagon  --  that would have been something . He could have said , Here ? s where they stood once : my family , my great-greats , the people who knew all the things that were kept from me. // It was Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my aunt had assumed that she wouldn ? t . They ? d known her all their lives , after all , and she ? d never said a word . But when Aunt Ruth finally blurted out " Who is our grandfather ? " the old woman replied , " Don ? t you know that ? " //
