I WAS EIGHTEEN AND ATTENDING the University of Tennessee in Knoxville . Attending may be too strong a word . I was more often absent from than present in my classes , which included Nuclear Physics and Symbolic Logic , both of which I was flunking . In Nuclear Physics students perched high on bleachers and stared down at the Oak Ridge scientist onstage , whose accent was untranslatable to my ears . The Symbolic Logic professor had a floating eye and bounced on sponge-soled shoes in front of the room . In my literature class ( which I must also have been flunking ) , we were reading Cervantes 's Don Quixote and Joyce 's Ulysses , both of which were over my junior-year head , although I kept trying to get through Don Quixote because it was one of my father 's two favorite books . ( The other was Fielding 's Tom Jones . ) The Modem Library edition lay atop the table in the single back room I rented in a boarding house , and each day I read some . But everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and logic and physics I could n't grasp ; I did n't know who I was or why everything I did turned out such a mess and made my parents angry . I did n't know why the school nurse had sent me to the psychiatrist or why the psychiatrist said my answers to his Rorschach test meant I had " a male mind in a female body . " I was completely mystified about my female body , which one graduate student  --  a red-haired John Wayne , an alpha male from Memphis  --  hijacked to the mountain cabin of his dissertation adviser , there , with the tacit encouragement of friends , to seduce me , except that I sat up all night with my back against the headboard , chewing my nails to the quick and supplying arguments drawn from Symbolic Logic as to why I should not lose my virginity to him . He drove me back to the boarding house the next morning , opened the car door from inside , waited for me to get out , and took off in a fury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell was stately , plump Buck Mulligan yakking about , anyhow ? If he was going to shave , why did n't he just shut up and shave ? What was so amusing about young men behaving pretentiously , showing off their recently acquired knowledge and wanting everyone to admire their wit ? The tower-top , Babel-onian dialogue between Mulligan and Stephen Dedalus was so arch and so cluttered with signposts for the reader ( Do n't miss these neat allusions to Christian theology and classical mythology ! They 're here to tip you off ! Think Greek ! ) that I immediately felt wary , hostile , defensive . The author had no intention of leading me on a journey into the unknown ; he just wanted to show off . He gave himself away with his characters . <p> At the same time , Joyce 's dancing words dizzied me with their dazzle . That long a prefacing a trio of short u sounds ; p and b and m revolving in my mouth like pebbles in Demosthenes ' . Still in the middle of the first sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie down . I would try to steady myself , but everything glittered and shimmered so . When I endeavored to imagine the view from the tower , I felt as if I were falling right over the stone railing . Try as I might , I could n't see it , " the scrotumtightening sea . " Literature is supposed to expand the imagination , beyond gender as well as other barriers , but I seemed to have trouble conjuring a fictional world while the one at hand was so unaccountable and strange . And though according to Joyce sunlight spangled the sea over which the tower looked , Mulligan 's cracked shaving mirror reflecting " the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant upon the sea , " it was always , I swear , raining on the actual page , a tiny inland lake being formed , I was surprised to realize , by my own tears , a topography of tears . <p> A classmate came to my room to talk about writing . We exchanged manuscripts and were offering each other a critique when the landlady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slut , and kicked the boy out . I 'll never forget the look on that boy 's face . He was as shocked and scared as if the man had had a pistol . He left , and I never saw him again either . The man turned to me and told me , not so nicely as this , to find somewhere else to live . I moved to an apartment so endowed with cockroaches I did not dare sleep or undress in it . Cockroaches could crawl all over me , my female body . My male mind cringed at this thought . ( Or was it the other way around ? ) The formerly-a-closet shower , with a sheet hung from tacks on the side where the door used to be , was in the living room and served as a kind of nest or meeting place for the cockroaches . I showered in the university gym instead . No wonder , given all this , that when I went to my classes , I slept through them . I was taking three others , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the ones in which I got A 's . <p> I met people . We congregated in the student union . Someone gave me a copy of The Well of Loneliness . ( My sexuality seemed to be on a lot of people 's minds , but books were on mine , and I read , or at least tried to read , whatever anyone suggested . ) Another acquaintance spoke vaguely of how a guy named Cruiser had gone to Mexico and brought back " stuff . " Well , I did say " those days . " This was so long ago , longer than I could imagine back then . The previous summer I had ridden the bus from Richmond to Knoxville , stayed at the YWCA , and searched for a room to rent ( it occurs to me that my landlady should have known when I first answered her ad , and long before her brother proclaimed it , that her tenant would turn out to be a slut , since , I discovered when she invited me to take a seat on the antimacassar-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor doing her horoscope ) , and in my bandbox-white high heels and pink-and-white polka-dot sundress I had felt summery and hopeful ; but already , during registration , I was bewildered , confused , afraid , and now I had lost the ability to read even books that had the advantage of not being assigned . The Well of Loneliness seemed more eccentric than Ulysses , less sequential than Don Quixote , and I did n't have a clue . All I knew was that whatever I wrote was not going to be murky . The Well of Loneliness was murky . At least to me . <p> I revealed to my new crowd my intention of being a writer , and the leader asked to see some of my poems . He was tall , dark , commanding , with an air of desperation about him ; his wife  --  wife ! I was meeting married people ! I could hardly believe I had grown so old-had long blond hair and looked like Mary ( the Mary then ) of Peter , Paul , and Mary . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them fiercely . Looking back , I think they were kind people , because they encouraged my belief that I was meant to be a writer . <p> Another member of the group was a fellow I had met on my summer scouting trip and who had written me letters when I returned to Richmond . " I gather from your poetry , " he wrote in one , " that you are no stranger to the sheets . " Wanting not to be murky , I had been explicit where , I now realized , murk might have been preferable . I was ashamed to tell him the truth , so I let him think he was right . When I showed a poem to my mother , over Christmas break , in which I used the word " nipple , " she had what the doctor explained was a " mock heart-attack " and went to bed in her attic room and said she never wanted to see me again . My father was disgusted with me ; he thought I had killed her , or more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chances with me , they took to dropping by the apartment ; we 'd sit around talking about books and art and ideas . Answering a knock on my door one night , I found myself facing two cops . " There have been complaints , " they said , " that you are entertaining men here at all hours . Men have been seen entering and leaving this apartment at all hours . " <p> I was shocked . Could they really be thinking what they seemed to be implying ? " I 'm not a prostitute , " I said , feelingly , " I 'm a poet ! " <p> Soon I was told I would have to move . <p> Luckily , I had met a girl from Shady Valley , Tennessee , who was studying painting . Maline was the first in her family to go to college and seemed to know what she was doing in a way that I did not . We moved into an apartment together . It was clean and had no cockroaches . Every night people would come over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouths of wine bottles , dripped wax that stratified geologically over the labels until they looked like relief maps . We read Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti . I read A Coney Island o the Mind and managed to understand it . Maybe I was n't a hopeless case . I read Celine 's Journey to the End o the Night and The Journal of Albion Moonlight by Kenneth Patchen and Jean Toomer 's Cane and understood them . Maybe I could even become a hopeful case . We drank the wine before we turned the bottles into makeshift candlesticks , but no one had any " stuff . " One of the women kept having to fly to Cuba for abortions ; the way I remember it , she had about three in the space of two weeks . Her boyfriend was Cuban . I say " one of the women , " but most of our guests , like mine of the previous month , were guys  --  still , if anyone besides the Cuban and his girlfriend were having sex I did n't know about it . Mainly , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aspired to the world-weariness of Jelly Roll Morton or Jean Genet or Christopher Isherwood , stayed up too late , and  --  more and more  --  skipped classes . Except Maline ; she knew better than to skip class . <p> My parents were building a house ; they were often at the site , where there was as yet no telephone . The dean called me into his office to inform me that he had spoken with my father . " He said you used to play the piano , " the dean said , as if pleasantly chatting . <p> " Yes , " I said . " I quit because I decided to be a writer instead . " <p> " Your father said you quit because you had no talent . " <p> I left the office reeling , and I could n't get in touch with my father . I did n't know how to call him at the school where he taught , and did n't think he would have liked me to . <p> The next time the dean called me in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been seen riding on the back of a motorcycle . " <p> " I 've never been on a motorcycle , " I said , truthfully . <p> " That 's not what the reports say . " <p> What reports ? Whose reports ? Why would anyone give a damn whether I was on the back of a motorcycle ? Did I mention that I was finding this world unaccountable and strange ? <p> The dean summoned Maline , too , but she simply let him say whatever he wanted and then went on doing what she was doing ( and she was still attending classes ) . <p> I fell a little bit in love with a boy who had dropped out or already finished or never had been in college ; I did n't know exactly what his status was , but he was an artist , a painter , and kept late hours , appearing and disappearing as if , unlike the rest of us , he had things to do besides sitting in diners listening to country music on the jukebox and holding forth on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get him to notice me ; he told me I was too young , unformed , " a bitty thing needing to be unhooked and thrown back into the sea . " Rejected , I consoled myself with daily sundaes at the drugstore , putting on poundage ( though since I weighed about ninety-two to begin with , I was not in danger of becoming overweight ) . I knew the drugstore clerk was concerned about my state of mind ( he did n't know it was a male mind ) , and I avoided meeting his eyes when I ordered another sundae . <p> The dean kept badgering me . The phone would ring , and it would be his secretary telling me I was expected in his office at such and such an hour , and I knew he would tell me how disappointed in me my father was , how he was so fed up he was n't sure he even wanted to claim me as his daughter anymore . The dean said my father was going to cut me off , and sure enough , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jelly and a loaf of bread from the local market , the kind of corner shop that still had a wooden floor and penny-slot vending containers , shaped like space helmets , for jawbreakers and gum . When someone played rhythm-and-blues on the phonograph , I felt I knew rhythm , I felt I knew blues . <p> " Tell me about your friends , " the dean said , " and maybe I can talk your father into sending you some money . " He wanted to know about the guy from Cuba : What were his politics ? Why did his girlfriend fly to Cuba so frequently ? <p> How was I supposed to know the answer to that when I could n't even read the Great Novels on my lit-course reading list ? <p> " I do n't know , " I said . And " I do n't know , " I said again . I knew better than to mention the word abortion . <p> " Your father , " the dean said , " is very unhappy to hear about your motorcycle riding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night I received a telegram from my father . " COME HOME NOW STOP , " it said . " WILL NOT PAY TUITION FOR NEXT SEMESTER STOP . " Ten words exactly . <p> I showed it to my current boyfriend-or friend ; Stilton James was not quite a boyfriend , but he was gentle and caring and I liked him . This was not the moody , mysterious painter but a student who planned to go to law school . He read the telegram and then held it in the candle-flame until it caught fire and crumpled into ash . The flakes were as thin as air , charred air . <p> The next day I went to the registrar 's office and officially dropped out . I called the bus station and bought a ticket to Richmond . <p> The morning I was to leave , Stilts and I were in the apartment alone ; he had come over to help me finish packing . At one point I happened to glance out a window , and there were two patrolmen  --  or state troopers or campus guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were checking around the back of the building . They seemed to be looking for me . The bus was n't due to leave for six or eight hours , but the empty apartment was creepy , and the cops were creepy . Stilts and I were ready to go anyway , so while the cops were still in the back we walked down the front steps , got in Stilts 's car , and drove to the bus station , where we sat quietly at a little table behind a paperback rack , drank coffee , and occasionally murmured some small comment . A half-hour before the bus pulled in , Stilts flipped through the rack and picked out a book . He paid for it and handed it to me . " You 'll need something to read on the bus , " he said , flushing a little . It was The Dharma Bums by Jack Kerouac . <p> I said thank you , and then the bus came , and Stilts gave my suitcase to the driver to stow , and I got on and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was a long ride-fourteen or fifteen hours . I was too shy to strike up a conversation with anyone . I watched the scenery until the bus began to fill with shadows , as if all the empty seats were being taken by ghosts , the shades of a Blue Ridge Elysium . Gears shifted as we climbed , we drove through a brief rainstorm , passengers sighed or mumbled or fished in their pockets or handbags for peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches ( as did I , of course ) , but the bus seemed haunted by silence and darkness . When it was full night , I switched on the overhead light and read Kerouac . <p> Every so often I 'd put the book down on the empty seat beside me . When , at twelve years old , I renounced the piano  --  it had been a renunciation , a public declaration of my dedication to writing  --  I was working on Beethoven sonatas . The only person who had complained about my lack of talent then was me . I did n't think I could be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these years we have wound up living a couple of blocks apart and , though no longer in Tennessee , still painting , still writing  --  " You did n't just tell us you wanted to be a writer . You said you were going to be a great writer . " " I did ? " I ask , disbelieving , wondering how I could have been so bold , so self-revealing , so-above all for a southerner-impolite . ) <p> My parents met me at the bus station in Richmond , but , I learned , they had gone there not expecting me and only because they did n't know what else to do . It seems the dean had telephoned to say I had disappeared . " An all-points bulletin has been issued , " he informed my father . " We 're sure we 'll find her . " While I was catching the bus , riding the bus , getting off the bus , police were combing the city , scouring the state . The dean told my parents he thought I might be hiding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have run off to San Francisco . It was quite likely , he said , that I had gotten knocked up and run away to New York City and been chopped into small pieces by a defrocked-defrocked ? - back- alley surgeon who regularly botched his unholy manipulations . Some instinct brought them to the station anyway . <p> As relieved as my parents were to see me step off the bus , my mother was staring hard at my stomach , which was , because of all those hot-fudge sundaes , rounder than before . Puffier . Even poofier . Hardly a word was said on the way home , home being the old house I was used to . The next morning my big brother came in to wake me ; he 'd been delegated to find out what was going on with me . ( He was often delegated this task . ) He picked up The Dharma Bums from the chair where I had tossed it . " Aha , " he said , " I thought so . " I knew then that everyone had already decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . For weeks I said nothing , or nothing much . What did I have to say to a father who thought I was talentless ? To a mother who cast a shrewd eye on my stomach whenever I wore anything not black and outsized ? To a brother who nodded knowingly whenever I did wear something black and outsized ? <p> My kid sister said she was ashamed of me . <p> My mother said , " Putting on a little weight around the middle , are we ? " <p> I was not about to explain that she had nothing to worry about . Let her worry , I thought . It serves her right . <p> After a while , of course , it became clear that I was not pregnant . I lost weight and became my usual skinny self , although wearing black turtleneck sweaters and white lipstick . Eventually we began to talk about what had happened . We discovered that the dean had been lying to both my parents and me . Why ? Several years later I heard rumors , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow had to do with the Bay of Pigs invasion . But for my part , I supposed that the university simply wanted to break up a group of what they considered troublemakers-poets ! painters ! they might as well be prostitutes  --  and realized I was the easiest student to go after first . Much later Maline told me she thought the university had not liked it that our group was integrated , and now that seems the most plausible explanation . I was officially expelled . My parents moved into the new house , and I , unable to find a school willing to have me , moved with them . In my new room I began to write a novella . The pages piled up . Nothing was raining on them . I could see the words , see them and understand them . It was n't Joyce or Cervantes , but neither of them had been himself at my age , either . At least I understood what I was reading now . I was making things clear for myself . <p> What does a novelist or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The answer to the question is the unknown upon which the novelist , with the reader , advances ( but does not necessarily arrive at or define ) . The novelist who has the answer before beginning to write risks no transformation of self and offers the reader no opportunity for a transformation of self . It is the clarity of the question that counts , that moves and involves and educates the reader . A great novelist confronts a great question , though that is of course not the only requirement . <p> I finished my novella , put it in a drawer , and began composing letters to colleges . It would not be easy to find one that would take me . <p> Meanwhile , the dean had kept after Maline , but she was n't to be budged . She was graduated and was accepted for graduate work in painting at the University of Iowa . After she arrived in Iowa , she received a letter from the University of Tennessee saying she would not be allowed to return there . <p> As Maline says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later my parents , frantic with worry , had to call the Chesterfield County Volunteer Rescue Squad for help finding my sister and her longtime steady , who were out past curfew . The rescue squad shone a flashlight on them in a room over a garage at the boyfriend 's house . Reminded , now , of her own walk on the wild side , my sister wrings the dishcloth dry , drapes it over the kitchen faucet , and laughs . <p> More time passed . The Bay of Pigs was a fiasco , Dallas a disaster . Stilton James took a job in District Attorney Jim Garrison 's office in New Orleans . Several of our group were drafted , including the intriguingly aloof artist . A second Kennedy was murdered . Martin Luther King Jr . died by an assassin 's bullet in Memphis . Cities burned . I read Krapp 's Last Tape by Beckett , was in utter awe of it , bought a recording , and listened to it over and over . People gave parties for the Black Panthers . " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I must teach you . You must read them in the original . " Now I took the words to heart and studied The Iliad , memorizing some of it . I married , divorced , lived in New York and England . I returned to Ulysses , got through it , and was stunned by the beauty of Joyce 's descriptions of the ordinary world . Mythology aside , linguistic games aside , " mock-turtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs " pulled the reader into " Harrison 's , " outside which " a barefoot arab stood over the grating , breathing in the fumes . Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way . Pleasure or pain is it ? " Father Conmee 's ankles were " thinsocked " and " tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field . " Molly recalled " the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leopold Bloom carefully observed , on top of the stove , " a blue enamelled saucepan " and " a black iron kettle . " Joyce 's odyssey through Dublin was navigated detail by detail . Perhaps the psychiatrist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville would have said that Joyce had a female mind in a male body . <p> The Beats were followed by Metafictioneers , Ethnonovelists , Minimalists , and the new Maximalists . In poetry , Deep Imagists , Anecdotalists , L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets , and New Formalists ( and more ) put in appearances . In 1983 , Joyce Johnson published a finely tuned book titled Minor Characters in which she described her youthful love affair with Kerouac . When she told him she was writing a novel , he asked her to name her favorite novelist . " I said Henry James , and he made a face , and said he figured I had all the wrong models , but maybe I could be a great writer anyway . He asked me if I rewrote a lot , and said you should never revise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was going to look at my work and show me that what you wrote first was always best . I said okay , feeling guilty for all that I 'd rewritten , but I still loved Henry James . " <p> I love Joyce Johnson . <p> Terrorists took to bombing and poisoning . Ireland 's turmoil  --  like Yugoslavia 's , Africa 's , India 's , the Mideast 's  --  seemed eternal , but elsewhere the invasion of Grenada , the Persian Gulf War , the devastating fires in Indonesia came and went . Governments came and went-the Soviet Union went !  --  celebrities came and went . The world changed ; it always does , of course , but when you are eighteen , you do not always believe it will . I changed , too . It was a short while a long time ago that I was a teenage beatnik , and I am sure there is much about that time that I 've forgotten , but I remember being kidnapped to the mountain cabin , shown the door by the **29;1434;TOOLONG hysterical brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expelled by a devious , ditzy dean , abandoned by books , and dispraised by my parents . These would be sad memories were they not so picaresque and such good comical material . I have come to understand why my father treasured Cervantes and Fielding . <p> The year after I was a beatnik I became a senior , read a great deal of philosophy , wore kneesocks , and got the Modern Dance instructor to promise me a B in return for sitting quietly in the bleachers , a book on my lap , and not wrecking class morale with my total inability to execute a single dance movement . It was a way of being absent while in attendance . <p> <p> By Kelly Cherry <p>
