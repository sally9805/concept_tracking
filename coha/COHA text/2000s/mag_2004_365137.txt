Bunny Wailer was a founding member  --  with Bob Marley and Peter Tosh  --  of the Wailers , the legendary reggae band . Bunny , the last survivor of that core trio , will perform opening day at the 21st annual Reggae on the River Festival in Piercy , Calif. , Aug. 6-8 ( tickets are available on eBay ) . Reggae on the River , a DVD of past festival performances , is out this week . TIME 's Christopher John Farley spoke with Bunny . <P> WHAT MAKES THIS FESTIVAL SPECIAL ? It 's a Rasta-ized event . It 's a very cultural setting . The atmosphere makes you feel very welcome and very united with the next person that you see . <P> WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO COMBAT PIRACY ? The Wailers might have been the most pirated group coming out of Jamaica , because we were accepted globally . I ca n't be wasting too much time and energy on these pirates because sometimes it 's not worth it . <P> WHAT SHOULD FANS DO ? I would like the fans to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in support of the Wailers . And I would hope they would n't buy those albums . <P> WHY ARE THE WAILERS STILL SO POPULAR WITH KIDS EVEN TODAY ? When we sang those songs , we were teenagers . So it affects teenagers . And then as they grow , it grows with them . You never get tired of the Wailers , because you ca n't find two Wailers songs that sound alike .
