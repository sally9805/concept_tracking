Mohammed Imad Khazalalrubai does not appear in any deck of cards or on any list of Iraq 's most wanted . Until last week , the 16-year-old was an ordinary student in an affluent suburb of Baghdad . But it took only minutes to transform him from a bystander to American rule in Iraq to a willing recruit for the resistance movement , vowing to kill U.S. soldiers . As he and his brother Zaid drove home after collecting their family 's monthly rations of flour , rice and cooking oil , they came upon a hastily established American checkpoint , part of an outer security cordon thrown up during a raid on a neighbor 's house . The boys were nudging their white sedan through a crowd of onlookers when suddenly , according to witnesses , soldiers in a humvee 150 yds. away opened up , firing high-velocity rounds through the windshield of the boys ' car . <P> When the firing stopped , Zaid , 13 , opened a door and stuck his head out to shake off the shattered glass . At that point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My brother 's blood will not go for nothing , " Mohammed screamed in anguish two days later , his wounds from the shooting still swathed in bandages . " I 'll take revenge on those American sons of b . " <P> For months now , U.S. officials have banked on the capture of Saddam Hussein to quell the attacks against American soldiers . But as Mohammed 's story illustrates , resistance to the U.S. occupation of Iraq goes beyond loyal remnants of the old regime . The non-Baathist components of the opposition include nationalists , tribalists and ordinary citizens offended by the armed presence of foreigners and especially by the occupiers ' perceived power abuses . Other resisters include non-Iraqi Arabs , possibly jihadis who have traveled to Iraq to take on the U.S. , as well as fundamentalist Shi'ites . <P> While taking Saddam down may demoralize his followers , it would not necessarily dull the anger of these other parties . In fact , many Iraqis believe it would provoke them to stronger action . " Saddam 's being caught or killed is n't good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fugitive Taha Yassin Ramadan , Saddam 's Vice President . " There are many people who would like to fight against the Americans , but if they fight now , they 'll be considered Saddam 's people . So the resistance will be stronger if Saddam is captured or killed . " <P> The most pervasive threat emerges from a fierce nationalism and a deep-rooted tribal instinct that interpret every U.S. search or arrest as an insult . That feeling is perhaps strongest in Fallujah and Ramadi , cities west of Baghdad where some of the most deadly attacks on American troops have come . These cities fall within the so-called Sunni triangle , where U.S. officials believe Saddam and most of his followers are hiding . But locals deny that the attacks have any connection with Saddam . <P> " We have no relation whatsoever with the old regime . Most of us were imprisoned and humiliated in Saddam 's time , " says Fallujah 's Abu Bilal al-Fallujah , whose cousin launched at least two attacks on American convoys before he was killed in an explosion at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with the way the Americans ignored our ideas and customs . They humiliated us ; they occupied our mosque . Of course , I will seek revenge if I am insulted . "
