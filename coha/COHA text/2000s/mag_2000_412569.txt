Specialized P.Brain $200 Specialized , 408 ! 779-6229 ; www.specialized.com ****VERDICT : Feature-laden , cycle-specific , on or off-road Headnote CatEye MSC 3Dx $175 CatEye , 8001522-8393 ; www.cateye.com **** VERDICT : Multi-sport adaptable , road-oriented legible // SPECIALIZED P.BRAIN COMPUTER is the most sophisticated and feature-laden bike computer from a company that 's been making them for five years . Its translucent-green iMac-inspired case hides more features than a mega-plex movie house . Included are all the standards ( speed , average speed , maximum speed , tip distance , odometer , auto stop/start timer , average speed indicator and clock ) . Not-so-common functions are the heart rate ( with high/low limit alarms , average heart rate , audible alarm , time in heart rate ) and altimeter ( including accumulated total and current attitude ) functions . Top it off with PC downloadability , and you 're looking at a whole lotta technology on your handlebar-and all packed into a unit no bigger than the average cycling computer ( 2.5x 2xl.75 inches ) . Three buttons-two small , one large-guide you through a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to get started . Once set up , the LCD screen displays up to three segmented levels of information . This means a ton of information is shown , but unfortunately small enough to harm legibility  --  especially when rough off-road ventures only allow for the occasional quick glance . Most difficult to see are the 14 icons that must be scrolled through to advance to the next function . Familiarization is the cure for this , of course , but even then it 's difficult to see where the top and bottom feature cursors are pointing when you 're in the thick of trail riding . An extra $50 gets you the PC download kit far collecting and analyzing the awesome collection of features-best for experienced computer users who want to keep meticulous records in a highly structured training program . CAME MSC 3DX comes from the company credited with producing the first micro cycling computer ( in 1980 ) . With the MSC Ax , a wristwatch heart monitor doubles as a full-function cycling computer using a surefooted interface mount it features the same features as the P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons and a large one found on the sides and top of the watch/computer guide you through the functions . As with the P.Brain , information is not scarce , although it 's difficult to scroll through and decipher when riding . Data appears fast and furious on the threepart LCD screen , and you must memorize ( because of the lack of icons ) which mode button does exactly what in what sequence-frustrating until you 're thoroughly accustomed to the thing . We like the fact that heart rate is prominently displayed , while the other features advance above and below it-smart Since its cadence feature has little relevance to the off-road enthusiast the MSC 30x is best suited for the rad/triathlon set It too , has a download kit ( $125 extra ) that allows you to store and analyze your data on a PC . HOW THEY MATCH UP : For the bicycle-dedicated athlete who needs a serious training tool , we recommend the P.Brain . For the extra $25 , you get the useful altitude function and a quick-reference heart rate zone graph that quickly relays where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last glances . The MSC 3Dx is great for hardcore cyclists who desire a watch unit for other activities-reason enough for many to consider this unit over the P.Brain . A final thought : Both are complicated enough that intuition wo n't get you past the first blinking icon , so be prepared to spend some serious reading time with the manuals and learning the functions . It you 're not interested in that kind of investment , save yourself some dough and get a cheap , $30 barn-essential computer instead . - Andrew Juskaitis <p>
