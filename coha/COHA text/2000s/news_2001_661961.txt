<p> Kristen Rutledge had watched friends slowly kill themselves with OxyContin . Her own cousin , just 18 , shot herself in the head , when she could n't get more of the drug . Girlfriends were prostituting themselves for another fix . <p> Still , when someone offered her a yellowish 40 milligram pill , she took it , chopped it up and snorted it . It was the start of a three-day binge , and she was hooked . <p> " It 's not like any other drug I 've ever done , " the 20-year-old says as she takes a drag off her umpteenth cigarette . <p> Over the next year , her habit grew until she was taking up to eight " 40s " a day , she says . When her dad , a county school board member and former mayor , found out , she tricked him into giving her more money by saying she was being threatened by drug dealers . <p> The cash drain contributed to Tim Rutledge 's loss of his grocery franchise . But Kristen did n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started panicking , " she says . " I had to get out and buy some more . " <p> Many in Appalachia call OxyContin " Hillbilly heroin . " Its abuse may not have started in the mountains , but it exploded here . <p> Across the region , people have overdosed on the powerful prescription painkiller and robbed pharmacies and family members to feed their habits . <p> " If this was an infectious disease , the Centers for Disease Control would be in here in white vans , " says Tim Rutledge . " There 's no doubt it 's very much a plague . " <p> To cancer patients and chronic pain sufferers , OxyContin is a wonder drug that can return them to a semblance of normal life . <p> Dr. Michael Levy , director of pain management at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia , calls Oxy " close to an ideal opiate . " While most strong pain medicines last only about four hours and take an hour or so to work , patients on Oxy get a steady 12-hour release of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liver damage . <p> " This product is better than anyone thought it would be when it was released five years ago , " he says . " This is a drug we need to protect , because it really helps patients . " <p> But to addicts who chew the pill or crush it to snort or inject , Oxy produces a one-shot , heroin-like high that can kill . <p> Purdue Pharma , the drug 's maker , is willing to concede that Oxy abuse has led to " somewhere between dozens and hundreds " of deaths in the past two years , says David Haddox , Purdue Pharma 's medical director . <p> " I am sure it has caused some deaths , " he says , " but my feeling is there is a magnification of this in the media . " <p> On Monday , the state of West Virginia sued the drug 's makers , accusing them of pressuring and enticing doctors to over-prescribe Oxy and of failing to adequately warn of potential abuse . Purdue Pharma called the suit 's claims " completely baseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damage . The company has stopped shipping its 160 milligram pills and has suspended shipment of 40s to Mexico because too many were finding their way back across the border . The firm has offered tamper-resistant prescription pads in Maine and other states , and it expects to help pay for a federal pilot program to track narcotics prescriptions in Florida , Mississippi , Ohio , Virginia and West Virginia . Purdue Pharma sent a representative to Gilbert in January to address concerns ; and it is running public service announcements on local radio to warn against abuse . <p> Law enforcement officials insist the problems have not been overblown . At least one dealer in Virginia has been charged with murder , and manslaughter charges were filed in a Florida Oxy death . Several Virginia doctors have been convicted of illegally dispensing the drug . Breaking and entering and armed robbery charges related to Oxy have been filed from Maine to Mississippi . <p> Michael Pratt , a prosecutor focusing on drug crimes in Kentucky , Tennessee and West Virginia , sees reasons why OxyContin hit Appalachia especially hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal and timber . Those are industries that produce serious injuries , so there are large numbers of people on painkillers . <p> " A lot of places , you got a headache , you 'll tough it out , " Pratt says . " Down here it 's like , ' Well , my grandfather 's got some drugs . I 'll take that and it 'll go away . ' And it just escalates . " <p> In addition , OxyContin sells on the street for $1 a milligram - up to $160 for the highest-dosage pill . In an area with chronic unemployment , that kind of money is hard to turn down . <p> For years , prescription fraud for Valium and other drugs has been a problem . " But , " Pratt says , " we 've never come upon something that kills people so much . I mean , if it killed them , they really had to work at it . <p> " Oxy rolls in . It 's so powerful , it just lays waste . " <p> " This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud investigator with the U.S. attorney 's office in Roanoke , Va . " I was a cop in Detroit and saw crack come through the ghettos , and I 've never seen anything like this . " <p> Neither had the tiny town of Gilbert . <p> Like many coal towns , Gilbert , pop . 417 , winds like a centipede along the riverbank , pushing leg-like hollows out into the surrounding hills near the Kentucky line . <p> OxyContin found its way here about five years ago . What started as a gentle rain soon turned into a flash flood . <p> Police Chief Greg Cline blames the drug for at least four deaths in town , and state police Sgt. J.J. Miller put the number at about a dozen for the entire county . But that number includes people who may also have been abusing other drugs . <p> A mental health counselor tells of a man who was having his teeth pulled two at a time , because each visit meant a new Oxy prescription . Kristen Rutledge has known people to shoot themselves for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling some of their pills . <p> " It seems like if you 're around people who are doing it , you catch it , " says Judy Compton , manager of the Compton Inn . " It 's contagious . " <p> She knows all too well . Her sister caught it , too . <p> Jeanie Compton was spoiled . Her mother gave her a red convertible BMW before she could even drive , and a trailer home to live in . When she wanted to get married at age 15 , her mother drove her across the Tug River . <p> Now it 's all gone . The BMW ? Traded for OxyContin . The trailer ? Sold for a few thousand dollars ' worth of pills . The husband ? Found slumped over in the bathroom with a needle nearby , dead of a suspected Oxy overdose . <p> Jeanie 's troubles began around 1991 , when her adoring father died suddenly at age 50 . She started experimenting with drugs . Along came Oxy . <p> At one point , Joyce Compton says her daughter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattresses , to supply her habit . Judy Compton stopped letting her come to her house . <p> " She 'd get up to leave and my stuff would fall out of her pantlegs , " she says . <p> On more than one occasion , Judy has found her little sister slumped in a chair , her head lolled over . <p> Last Sunday was Jeanie Compton 's 23rd birthday . She spent it in a jail cell , where she was serving time for violating home confinement to seek Oxy . Back home Wednesday , wearing a monitoring anklet , she says she 's ready to get serious about kicking Oxy . <p> " I 've said I 'm either going to end up in jail or dead , " she says . " Well , I made it to the jail . I ca n't come back from the grave . " <p> Locals have a nickname for the road : Pill Hollow . <p> " On one occasion I timed them , and in 30 minutes we had 45 cars coming to one house , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20 or so homes wedged into the mountains around him , he says four were occupied by dealers . <p> People are starting to lock their doors , and establishing community watches . Isolation , long an obstacle for Appalachia , has become something people miss . <p> " A lot of those troubles that used to be in the cities have really come home to plague this community , " says the Rev. Denny May , whose 19-year-old daughter , Shanda , killed herself in 1999 shortly after getting involved with Oxy . <p> When Pastor Clayton Cline asked his Baisden Community Church congregation who had been affected by OxyContin , he says , " Almost every one raised their hands . " <p> One hand was his own . <p> About a year and a half ago , his daughter became addicted to OxyContin after her husband received a prescription for an accidental gunshot . For the past six months , Cline 's daughter and son-in-law have been attending a church-based methadone program in Georgia . <p> Cline is a coal operator and has the means to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive methadone at a clinic in Charleston , the only one in the state . <p> " It 's no disgrace to have a problem . What 's the disgrace is when you try to hide it , " he says . " You ca n't hide this OxyContin . I 've found that out . " <p> Debbie Trent sits in a middle school auditorium in Bluefield , Va. , and listens . She is a mental health counselor from Gilbert , where she is a member of a new drug-awareness group called STOP - Strong Through Our Plan . She has driven two hours along mountain roads to see what folks in southwestern Virginia are doing to battle OxyContin . <p> A self-described OxyContin abuser named Mary tells the group , " Addiction stands on a mountaintop and throws down commandments : ' Thou shalt not abandon me . Thou shalt put no one or nothing before me . " ' She says she lost her job and committed prescription fraud because of OxyContin . <p> Another recovering addict , a 38-year-old mother of two identified only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she explains how she took 320 milligrams of Oxy in the morning before she had the strength to take her boys to school . Friends thought she had cancer . <p> For two hours , people talk about the problem . Dennis Lee , Tazewell County 's top prosecutor , says 80 percent of the crime in his jurisdiction is now related to OxyContin . <p> Sheriff H.S. Caudill says efforts to get a statewide prescription tracking system failed in the legislature this past year . Just as local firefighting is done by volunteers , Caudill tells the crowd , much of the burden of stopping Oxy abuse will fall on them . <p> " I look at OxyContin as a huge forest fire , " he says . " It 's burning everywhere in Tazewell County . ... There 's not enough of us , ladies and gentlemen . We need you . " <p> Kristen Rutledge has three tattoos she does n't remember getting . She went through physical problems - not menstruating for months , constipated for weeks . She stopped writing in her journal . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold turkey . The withdrawal lasted three days , the same as her first Oxy binge . <p> " I 'd rather have died , " she says , drawing her knees up to her chest . " I was vomiting . I could hear things and see things . I had pain all over my body , all over me - my head all the way down to my calf . " <p> Her habit cost her father tens of thousands of dollars . OxyContin is still costing Tim Rutledge : Now , he 's giving the cash-strapped police department money for undercover drug buys and taking out full-page newspaper ads warning others about drugs . <p> Kristen says she 's been clean for a month . But she 's not kidding herself . <p> " I 'm still addicted , " she says . " I 'm just not using . " <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE : Allen G.
