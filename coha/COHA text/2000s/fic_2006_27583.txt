Ronald Reagan , at ease with himself as ever , satisfied himself yet again on summoning the memory of his dealings with Blackford Oakes in October 1986 . He had done the right thing . But now , December 1987 , Oakes had put in for another meeting with the president . Their 1986 meeting had had to do with a plot to assassinate Gorbachev . A group of young Russians , weary and demoralized by the brutal Soviet war against Afghanistan , had planned to kill the Communist leader . Oakes , veteran CIA agent , was in secret and unshared touch with a Soviet defector he had long experienced as antagonist , but who was now a hidden ally . And so Reagan had had to ponder the agonizing question : Is it the business of the United States to get in the way of a plot by native Russians trying to get rid of Mikhail Gorbachev , general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party , and dictator ? Reagan had inclined , at first , to do nothing-let the Russians look after their own affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . Yet he was a blooded successor to a line of tyrants that had begun in 1917 with Lenin , followed by Stalin , a thirty-year curse . And then there had been Bulganin and Khrushchev and Brezhnev , another thirty years among them , followed by Andropov and Chernenko ( " elderly guys , " Reagan mused , " - about my own age " ) . They did n't serve for very long , but they did carry on the bloody Afghan war launched by Brezhnev . A war that Gorbachev , soon after his selection as general secretary , vowed to fight to the end . Should President Reagan do nothing ? Say nothing-when he got word through Oakes that an assassination had been plotted ? Reagan sat on theintelligence . While weighing the question of intervention , he reminded himself that the young conspirators were perfecting their plot . What finally influenced him had been the summit at Reykjavik . This was his second meeting with Gorbachev , and this time he sensed that Gorbachev was different enough from other Soviet leaders to be worth going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told him to intervene . To abort the assassination . If necessary , even if it meant exposing the ring of youthful plotters . Yes-if necessary-even if it meant exposing the deeply hidden Soviet asset , the clandestine defector who had tipped off Blackford Oakes . That was fourteen months ago , but Blackford vividly recalled the day the president gave him the order . Reagan had come right to the point . He told Oakes-his mouth slightly contracted , as was habitual when Reagan was spitting out instructions-that the plot was to be suppressed . Having made the critical decision , Reagan wanted the whole thing to go away . The very last thing he wished ever to be reminded of was that he had once given orders to betray a band of young Russian patriots . After all , were n't these people to be likened to the July 20th plotters against Adolf Hitler ? Likened to , well , the Romans who finally did away with Caligula ? He stopped himself from deliberating further along such lines . Sic semper tyrannis ! was good stuff , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flick of a finger , could dispatch nuclear bombs that would destroy lives by the tens of millions . Seven weeks after his fateful meeting with Oakes , Reagan received word . " The affair " had been " taken care of . " That could only mean that the young Russian plotters had been frustrated , presumably imprisoned , or executed . Gorbachev was safe on his throne . There had been a moment of high anxiety for Reagan , some while later , when he met with Gorbachev . The premier was in Washington on a state visit , and sat now with his host in the Oval Office , alone except for the two interpreters . Gorbachev suddenly turned in his chair . He looked Reagan straight in the face . Had the president known anything about the plot of last October to kill him ? he asked . Reagan was eternally grateful for his histrionic training . " Mikhail , " he said , his face redolent of sincerity , " let me give you my personal and most solemn word that no American official was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Reagan 's answer was formally correct . Reagan had not connived , and on deliberation would not have connived , even passively , in any attempted assassination . Gorbachev held his gaze on Reagan , waited a moment , and then nodded , moving on to another subject . He had heard from the president 's own lips what he wanted , and needed , to hear . But now , in December 1987 , would the subject of assassination come up again ? Oakes had invoked the oral code over the phone with the critically situated Kathy . " This is about Freckles . " That meant there was extra-institutional urgency in the requested meeting . The president would see again the man in the Central Intelligence Agency whom he had dealt with before , and had trusted for some years . The code was used sparingly , only three times during the Reagan years so far . It meant that Blackford needed to move outside the ambit of the director of the CIA , even when that had been Bill Casey , Reagan 's closest security adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four forty-five that afternoon . Neither party wanted routine clerical notice paid to their meeting . The usual approach to the Oval Office was therefore avoided . Kathy led Oakes into the Cabinet Room , and from there knocked on the side door of the Oval Office , bringing Oakes in . The president stayed at his desk and nodded with a friendly smile , pointing to the chair alongside . " Sir , the business of last October , the plot against Premier Gorbachev- " " Yes , yes . Why do we need to bring that up ? " " Because there 's a fresh design on his life-we think . Solid enough to bring to your attention . It comes to us from a survivor of the business of last October . But this time we 're not sure , not like last time . This time it 's a real complicated business- " " I do n't want to hear about it . " Reagan looked down at his desk , arched his eyebrows , and slowed down the tempo of the conversation . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do it one more time , abort , abort- " The president winked and leaned back on his chair . " I had a reputation back in California : I was a moderate on the subject of aborttion . " His creases broke into a smile . " You know the one about the British serial killer who said he was actually astonished by his moderation ? My reaction exactly ! " He paused and his eyes went to the painting of George Washington . He said deliberately , " There 's to be no moderation in anything you have to do to protect Gorbachev . And no reporting to me except as absolutely required . " " I wo n't report back anything in detail . It could all be just a bag of wind . But I think I ought to go over there and find out . " " What do you need from me ? Airplane tickets ? Come to think of it , Black , the White House has a pretty good travel agent . I guess it does . My plane is always there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need from me ? " " I do need one thing , Mr. President . Back then , last October , I was still director of covert operations for the agency . Since then , I 've had to . . . slow down , so I 'm just an agent . But as former operations chief , the rules say I 'm not allowed inside enemy territory . You 'd have to waive that rule . " The president pulled open his top desk drawer but then slammed it shut again . " I 've been sitting here for nearly seven years . The things they want me to write an executive order about ! Now this . " " You do n't have to write anything , sir . Just tell me it 's okay- " " Viva voce ? " Reagan was visibly pleased to use an old term of the trade . " Yes . " Blackford nodded . " Viva voce . " " Why do they have that rule ? " " Because if an operations chief were captured , he 'd have a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hold of through torture ? " " That 's the idea . " " How would you keep that from happening in your case ? " " I 'd take precautions . Sir . " Reagan paused . And then nodded . " I 'll pass your word on-if I have to , " Blackford continued . " I 'll book a flight through Zurich and enter the Soviet Union under cover . That will also make it harder for the bureaucrats in the CIA to remind me where I ca n't go . " " Okay , okay . You have my word on it . But do n't get me crossed up with your director . He 's a good man . " The afternoon sun broke in through the south window . Reagan 's arm reached back and he felt for the cord , bringing the shades down enough to neuter the sun 's glare . " I do n't know how it 's all going to end up with Gorbachev . You saw what he said on the seventieth anniversary of their revolution ? " Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said was " - Reagan 's voice was detached now , at public-speaking level- " that-I 'm quoting him-'In October 1917 , we parted the old world , rejecting it once and for all . We are moving toward a new world , the world of Communism . We shall never turn off that road . ' Maybe he needs a little prodding . " " Well , sir , we 've got a defense budget of nearly three hundred billion . That 's prodding , right ? " " Yes . That 's one way to make our point about road signs . Cap Weinberger would like to hear it put that way . Well , he 's secretary of defense , and secretaries of defense have a right to think that hundreds of billions on defense are a means of prodding people to do the right thing . " He got up from his chair . " If you need to see me again " - he extended his hand- " call Kathy . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
