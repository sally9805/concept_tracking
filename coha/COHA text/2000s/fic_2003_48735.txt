EARL BARROW WANTED TO TAKE ME HUNTING . He had no idea what he was doing . Neither did I. We were a man and a boy looking one way , walking another . <p> He had loved my father . The two men were best friends and very close . My father was a doctor . He called Earl the salt of the earth . Like everybody else , Earl Barrow , a shoe factory foreman , called my father Doc , but with his own quiet and constant and intense admiration . They hunted quail and fished trout whenever they could . When they could n't , they drove around the Tennessee fields in Earl 's Ford pickup truck , talking about rods , reels , guns , dogs , where to hunt and fish . Together they founded the Tri-State Field Trial Association , covering Kentucky , Tennessee , and North Carolina , for bird dog competition . When my father died , Earl Barrow , after the funeral , gave my mother the engraved silver trophy that would have been presented to my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . While Earl smiled at me with great affection . He said that after a while he would take me hunting again . Yes , just like it had been when I turned thirteen , just before my father died , and we three had gone to the fields together . It was a solemn promise . I nodded , said yes , I would like that , knowing no more what I was doing than he did . <p> It was early Saturday morning , just after sunup . Fog still lay all around us . It swirled away from the wheels of Earl 's Ford as he drove us out to the Berdice farm fields , where we could hunt as we wished , since that family had been treated for free by my father and its children given shoes by Earl Barrow in exchange for hunting rights . <p> Three dogs . A white-and-liver pointer named Morgan 's Early Riser . A speckled gray , lemon-eyed bitch named Cindy 's Swift Buchanan . They waited in the truck bed , next to the white-and-spotted Llewellyn setter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This dog was a famous ten-year-old champion , retired at stud . His name was Bob 's Happy Dancer . Three times he won the National Field Trial at Grand Junction , Tennessee , a great feat that had been unequaled since the days of Mary Montrose and Becky Broome Hill , fabulous dogs my father bought books about , almost the only ones in his house , except for my Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes books and Hamlet . Bob was my father 's pride . He loved Bob 's elder statesman bird doggy old age . <p> We turned into the Berdice farm fields , going up a dirt road until we got to the stand of lindens where by agreement Earl 's truck was always parked . It was n't that cold , but I was shivering as we got out of the truck and unpacked our shotguns . It was my job to hold the dogs leashed and jumping , ready to run . It was damp , though , and I wished I 'd worn long underwear . <p> You cast them , said Earl . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd know in which direction to run . He handed me the leashes . The two pointers waited stolidly , but Bob , excited at his age to be in the field again instead of kenneled as a stud sire , pulled hard against me . I looked out ahead over a run down to a clayed gulch , and over that into the beginning of four large open fields in sage where quail could be . With that strange , ugly growl-turning-sharp-cry men use when setting hunting dogs loose , I unhooked the leashes and cast the three dogs forward , with a wave in the air , as my father had done before me , something like bullfighters do in Spain . Earl nodded with satisfaction . I had learned my lessons , and he wanted me to know that he saw it , that the death of a father is only , I should understand , and from him , a natural part of the life they loved together , which will go on and on , as long as good men understand all this , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs half an hour to find birds . It was the lemon-eyed pointer who had them . She was stock-still and rock steady , with muscles quivering in the point . Bob , running to the left , saw her and stopped cold , backing her point without having the scent , since he was upwind . The liver pointer was about to come crashing in on them , flush birds , lose covey-good-bye quail . Out of my mouth came that cry , a man 's yell to a dog , commanding from a well-trained animal instant attention . <p> The liver pointer heard me . He slowed himself down . Running , he saw both Bob and the lemon-eyed pointer , both stock-still . He stopped dead and honored what they claimed , though he could not smell it . Such a pretty sight . Three bird dogs , a man of fifty , and a boy of thirteen , all thinking they knew what they were doing . <p> They 're yours , said Earl , meaning it was for me to step forward past the lemon-eyed pointer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air so we could shoot . Only then could the wonderful dogs bound forth to retrieve without one feather missing what we brought down . I did walk to the covey , but Bob jumped past me in a way I had never seen him move . It was the champion he had been before my father bought him , a Llewellyn setter , temperamental as a hunting dog and almost useless in trials because of that , able however with his longer fur flying , to show beautiful bird dog style afield . So Bob did , with astonishing speed for any bird dog , never mind that he was a ten-year-old lying-around-the-kennel old man out to stud . He went so fast he passed the lemon-eyed pointer , who was only a very few feet from the birds and rightly going slow to allow me , her hunting master , to walk up and flush the covey before smart quail figured out they were being hunted , flushed themselves , and flew away out of the range of all shotguns . So Bob , in this burst of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covey . <p> Explosion of wings . They flew up quicker than we had expected , in a body , veering in the air to the left , since Bob charged them from the right . <p> Earl Barrow stood to my left . I got off both barrels before he fired one . Like Bob , I too was fast , filled with a fierce energy not usually mine . In a breach of all sense , in an instant disregard of everything drummed into me by my hunter father , I wheeled , firing a double-barreled shotgun to my left with a man standing to my left . <p> There is a picture I keep by me always . It shows my father in his late thirties , a handsome if heavyset man , in a white linen suit appropriate for a doctor , squatting on his haunches , in well-polished two-toned shoes . He is doing that so his son , a little boy of four or five , also in white shirt and pants , can lean against him , one small arm around his neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long forgotten who held , both happy with , and confident in , the life they share . My father , himself shot down by cancer at forty-two , with the same quick dispatch with which he taught me guns and killing . In the study he made for himself in our small-town Tennessee house hung framed photographs hand-tinted in faded color he carefully imposed over the black-and-white snapshots they really were , pictures of quail and doves in piles , deer hanging to be stripped , bass , trout , carp , and catfish laid out before reed fish baskets and crossed fly rods . On the brown paper backs of these framed photographs of the life that was his , I wrote in childish pencil , at seven or eight in the life that was mine , names I could not spell . They were the outlandish names I heard after music on the radio . Do I spell it Lone Jean Simphonet , and who was it , what Russian name , wrote the music ? My father , when I asked him , did n't know and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forty thousand Earl Barrows could not make up his sum . Damn this day of hunting and this well-meaning man taking his place . <p> It almost happened . To think of it now . <p> But almost . Almost . I did not kill Earl Barrow , whether I wanted to or not . Instead he felt buckshot go red hot by his cheek , this last time he would take Doc 's boy hunting . <p> Whrrrrr , and step down on my left foot and swing the barrels around to my left , there they are flying away , the birds in the air and the fish in the water and the deer in the woods . I am once again in these wet cold fields when I could be home away from guns and death , listening to the Lone Jean Simphonet on the radio with my mother walking around a soft warm house half-naked , smiling at me and wanting me to stay there with her , but now all that wet cold world of fierce dogs and cold men outside and me not inside music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am good at it , with my father dead , who taught me so well , now forever in the ground . I never ever wanted to come back here and do this again and again but you , good buddy Earl , you fool , you pull me out of my mother 's warm and hidden promises , out to these cold hard fields again . All right , I will show you what I can do , how well my father taught me when you were n't around . I find in one flash two quail far left of the covey busting up in the air , fire twice before you can once , see your head explode , blown off your shoulders , blood and brains spurting out over the fields of my hatred , my father 's friend , you son of a bitch making me admit it , yes , I am glad he 's gone , my father , in the cold ground forever , no more dogs and guns . I can have my mother and he is lost , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But gone , hurray . I will never see him again , oh hurray . God help me now , at the hour of my death , and in this confusion of my heart which will never end . <p> Author Affiliation
