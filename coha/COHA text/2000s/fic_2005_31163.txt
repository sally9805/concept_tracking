Prologue I may not have spent much time with Lyndell Fulmer , or have known him the way that some people think a son ought to know a father , but I understood him . " If you remember anything , " he said , " let it be this . A real man eats pussy and drives a stick shift . " He told me this when I was ten years old . He was drinking Lem Motlow as we skimmed along a blacktop outside of town in his ' 66 Chevelle Super Sport . Three in the morning . I was the one behind the wheel , perched up at the edge of the seat so I could reach the gas and the clutch , edging up to 50 in a 45 . Lyndell was riding shotgun and doing his talking , most of it about driving , like how to downshift and work your heel and toe on the brakes and the accelerator at the same time . He was lean and dark , with kick-ass sideburns and a junior Porter Wagoner pompadour . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his legs , he fiddled with the radio dial , trying to find something worth listening to , all the while letting me drive as if I were Cale Yarborough . He pointed to an oak tree up ahead of us , sitting off a bend in the road . " That 's your entry point , right there , " he said . " When you get to that tree , squeeze the brakes and cut the wheel . Do n't jump on the gas again until you start to unwind . " " Unwind what ? " " The steering wheel , " he said . " What else ? " " Well , what if I start spinning ? " " You ai n't gon na spin . Jesus Christ , do n't be so goddamn negative . " He leaned back and mulled over the situation . " Of course , if you do spin , remember to turn into it , not against it . " " Got it . " " All right . Good . " He dialed in a Charlie Rich song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he could hear it over the screaming engine . The Silver Fox was singing about what goes on behind closed doors . Lyndell closed his eyes and started playing the dashboard like it was a baby grand . He did n't appear concerned in the least that I might wreck his car . I pointed the high beams right at the oak tree and prepared myself to brake and downshift . My baby makes me proud , Lord do n't she make me proud . She never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd . Claudia , my mother , was disappointed in Charlie Rich . She thought he 'd sold out and forsaken the hard-core , gut-bucket country shit that she really loved . Claudia stood firmly in the corner of folks like Hank and Lefty and Lester Flatt , Faron Young , Webb Pierce , and Hank Thompson . She liked the twang and the heartbreak and people talking about killing their lovers . Sounding too smooth never sat well with her . She never had much good to say about " Gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place more boring than the middle of the road , " she 'd say . She and Lyndell had the radio playing in the kitchen one night . They were smoking and fretting over my older brother , Nick , who was in the midst of a twelve-month prison term on account of marijuana trafficking . They 'd been to see him that afternoon , and they were talking about his lawyer and his upcoming parole hearing . That 's when Charlie Rich came on the radio . He was singing about the most beautiful girl in the world , prompting Claudia to forget all about Nick . " He used to be good , " she said , " back when he sang real country music . " I was eating a bowl of Pet vanilla ice cream , and Lyndell was tapping out the beat to the music with his Zippo . He shrugged and frowned . " It 's only a song , Claudia . Why ca n't you just relax and enjoy it ? " " Because , " she said , " the more you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gon na make . " She looked down at me . " Do you like this song ? " I shook my head . " I do n't like any of that country stuff . They all sound like a bunch of hicks . " Claudia could always get sidetracked by music . It might have even meant more to her than cars meant to Lyndell . They each had their Saturday-night destinations . Lyndell 's was the dirt track , where he 'd change the tires on the Chevelle , slap a pair of magnetized number 7 's to the doors , and race in the hobby stock class . Meanwhile , Claudia would be working over at the fish camp , dishing out hush puppies and slaw in the serving line until the house band called her onstage to sing her two songs : " I Ca n't Help It If I 'm Still in Love With You " and " Just Someone I Used to Know . " She 'd be wearing her Wranglers and straw cowboy hat , her thin , blonde hair pouring out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dance floor to give her a boost onto the stage , and then she 'd drop her apron and take her spot behind the mike , calling out " one , two , three " in an unsure voice , like she was n't going to pull it off . Then the Green Lake Gang would start up with their playing , and her voice would suddenly grow strong and run like cool water atop all of their twanging and banging . The men standing down front would stare up at her until their partners grabbed their shoulders and turned them back around to dance . Claudia and Lyndell could have been one of those couples in a country duet , maybe something by Dolly and Porter , or Conway and Loretta . Verse one would have covered the early years , Claudia sixteen and living with a second cousin , just a quiet girl who 'd been abandoned by her mother . Then Lyndell comes along , a good bit older , already been through one marriage and a stint in Korea , nursing a constant hangover while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glow that 's not all whiskey , and Claudia falls for him . She turns up pregnant , they get married , and Nick is born . Life 's sunnier than July . Verse two would have to introduce the heartbreak ; Lyndell drifting and drinking and fighting his demons , finally leaving and getting married to another woman . Claudia 's all alone again , except for the kid . It ai n't July anymore . Verse three would provide the reconciliation , with Dolly doing the singing : And then , eight years later , he called me out of the blue . He said , " Honey , I 'm with this other woman , but I 've been thinking of you . " He said , " I 'm the water and you 're the moon , and if I ca n't see you soon , then I do believe my heart will turn to dust . " That would have been a good ending right there , Dolly taking him back and then fading things out with a nice refrain about lovers under the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more verses to go , and they really were n't all that song-worthy . Of course , I still had to be born . And then Lyndell would run back to his wife , who 'd eventually find out about the fling that produced me . She 'd shit a brick , divorce Lyndell , settle up for possession of his GTO , and then burn it right in front of his eyes for spite . Lyndell would drift for several years , until he heard about Nick being locked up . And that would bring him back again . He was no longer the dashingly drunk paramour . He was just a man who needed a place to stay . And so Claudia offered him the sofa . I met Lyndell at two o'clock in the morning , when he slipped into my bedroom smelling of sweet liquor and cigarette smoke . I did n't know who he was . I only heard the floorboards creaking in the darkness , so I reached under the bed for my Rico Carty baseball bat . As soon as the tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ass to right field . All the air rushed out of his body . He groaned , dropped to his knees , and fell onto his side . He looked like a wrestler who 'd just been thrown from the ring . " My kidney , " he whimpered . " Oh , God . I think my kidney 's ruptured . " The hallway light came on and Claudia swept into the room , still tying her blue bathrobe . I was standing on the bed with the bat cocked behind my ear , and Lyndell was lying on his back with his hands covering the top of his head . Claudia rushed over and grabbed the barrel of the bat . " Holy shit , Luke . Do n't kill him . That 's Lyndell . That 's your father . " My heart slowed to a trot . I pulled the bat off my shoulder and tilted my head to get a better look . My body felt warm and tight all of the sudden , like someone had rolled me up inside a big , heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he realized I had no intention of smacking him again , he swiped his hand across his chest . " That 's the take sign , " he said . I dropped the bat on the bed . " You ought a try knocking . I thought somebody was breaking in . " Claudia helped him sit up . He groaned and touched his fingers to his side . " Jesus , boy . You swing like Willie McCovey . " I hopped off the bed , dressed in my skivvies and socks . That 's what Nick slept in , at least before he went to prison . He 'd told me the socks were more important than pants  --  they took longer to put on in case you had to make a fast getaway . " You 're lucky I was choking up , " I said . Lyndell pushed himself to his feet . He was wearing his Wranglers , a blue T-shirt , and a gray Amoco jacket with his name stitched over the heart . Claudia could n't help but smile a little as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over from the blow . " So what 's the word ? " she asked . " Are you gon na live ? " " I think so . " He laid his hand on his side again . " I might be pissing blood for a few days , but otherwise ... " " Well , what were you thinking , sneaking in here like that ? " she asked . He pointed my way . " I was gon na see if he wanted to take a ride . " " At this time of night ? " " Well , yeah . It 's the best time . No cops . No traffic . " " Oh , Lord . " She was smiling , though , and Lyndell was looking over her shoulder . He was smiling , too . He even gave me a wink . The next night , I was ready to make a fast getaway , wearing my Keds and my Toughskins under the covers . Lyndell was careful to knock . He stuck his head in the door and waved his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and climbed into the white Chevelle . It was long and low-slung , with a twin-bulge hood , a Muncie four-speed , and mag wheels . The front fenders were embossed with crossed flags and the words " Turbo Jet . " I 'd never been impressed much with cars before then , but this one got my attention . It was the smell as much as anything else , the cigarette smoke and the leather and the gasoline . It smelled like the place to be at two o'clock in the morning . Lyndell coasted down the driveway so the engine would n't wake Claudia . He rolled halfway down the street and fired up the motor on the fly . BA-WOOM , WOOM , WOOM , WOOM . The big V-8 scared me . It felt like that engine was over us , under us , in front and behind us . I grabbed hold of the dashboard with both hands . Lyndell glanced over and smiled . I let go and tried to sit back like I was n't all that impressed . We did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with the radio as he steered us along the crooked roads , braking and downshifting and romping on the gas when it was needed . He drove faster than anybody I 'd ever seen , and it took a while for me to relax and start to feel like the engine was n't so much surrounding me as a part of me . It made me feel fast , strong , loud , and hard to break . We lived forty miles north of Atlanta in a town called Green Lake . It had n't even been a town before World War II , just an empty river valley . The Army Engineers drove in after the war and decided the valley would be the perfect spot for a huge dam to help water and electrify all the people in Atlanta . The result was Green Lake , a forty-thousand-acre pond , which had become , as I 'd learned in social studies class , a " valuable water , power , and recreation resource . " Or as Claudia used to say , " Take away the lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lyndell wheeled the Chevelle past the Holiday Inn . It was a fairly impressive structure for Green Lake in 1973  --  a two-story job , all lit up , the parking lot filled with automobiles . Tom T. Hall was on the car radio , singing about heaven and how the water there tasted an awful lot like beer . " Hmm . " Lyndell slowed the car and eyed the hotel 's lighted swimming pool . It shone like a bright , blue gem out in the middle of the parking lot . " I think me , you , and Claudia might need to come over here one night and take a dip in that thing . " We passed the Krystal , the Big Star , and the Dairy Queen . The buildings glowed under the spring moon , their neon signs still flickering long after closing . The bank 's time-and-temp sign said it was 2:46 A.M. and 65 degrees . Lyndell drove down to the end of the commercial strip and pulled into Wilson 's Auto Supply , an old cinder-block eyesore . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out onto the gravel . He motioned for me to follow him . " You ever seen one of these ? " We were standing in the shadows at the back door of Wilson 's . Lyndell was holding up a greasy piece of metal . I shook my head . " Uh-uh . " " It 's a distributor cap , " he said . " I need a new one for the car . You think you could get in under that door and get me one ? " He pointed to the dog door that was cut into the bottom of the door frame . It was small , barely the size of a dachshund . I knew it would be a tight fit . " I thought you worked at a garage . Ca n't you get one of those for free ? " " Well , I do n't exactly have a job yet . I mean , hell , I just moved in with y'all yesterday . " He crossed his arms and scratched at his chin . " I 've got a line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We used to race together and everything , so he does n't really mind me coming in and taking what I need . " " Would n't he give you some keys if he did n't mind you coming in ? " Lyndell scratched at his head and looked back over his shoulder . My questions were making him awfully itchy , but I kept asking them . " You really raced together ? " Lyndell shrugged in a dodgy sort of way . " More like against each other . We do n't get along too well . " " How come ? Did you beat him ? " I imagined Lyndell standing in the winner 's circle with a big trophy . " Sort of , " Lyndell said . " He ran me into the wall one night when I was leading . Two laps to go in the feature race . Came up underneath me and hit my rear axle . " " And you still beat him ? " " Well , no . Not in the race , anyway . Hell , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But after it was over , I wrapped a tire iron in newspaper and went after him down in the pits . I got in a good head shot before they pulled me off him . Split his scalp wide open . " " That 'd be a better story if you 'd come back and won the race . " " Yeah , I know . Funny thing is , I met his wife a couple years later in this bar . " He smiled and wolf whistled , remembering the occasion . " I got him back real good then . " We stood there staring at each other . " You mean you hit his wife in the head with a tire iron , too ? " He shook his head and scratched his shoulder . He was n't used to telling his stories to kids . He pointed to the dog door again . " So what do you think ? Will you do it ? " I 'd stolen some stuff before : candy bars and cinnamon toothpicks from Elmore 's Five and Dime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school . I 'd actually felt bad when the kid started crying about his toy car . Nevertheless , I wanted to impress Lyndell . " You need anything else while I 'm in there ? " Lyndell smiled . " Now that you mention it , I could use a new oil filter . But that 's all . There 's no need to get greedy . " I had to wiggle my ass a little to get my hips through the dog door . Lyndell helped me along with a shove . " In you go , " he said . The stockroom was windowless and pitch black . It smelled like mildew and grape soda . I switched on the flashlight Lyndell had given me and made my way up front . The caps and the filters were exactly where he 'd said they would be . I pocketed the goods and scrambled back to the dog door . I felt like Colonel Hogan on one of his nighttime scouting missions outside the stalag . Lyndell had said he would time me on his watch to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid the distributor cap , oil filter , and flashlight through the door and wormed my head and shoulders out into the cool night air . I looked up from the ground , still half in and half out of the store . " How long ? " I asked . Lyndell had already retrieved the goods . He was reading something off the back of the oil filter box . He glanced at his watch and shrugged . " About two minutes , eighteen . " " That 's bullshit , " I said . His mouth dropped open in a gesture of mild shock . " Does Claudia know you talk like that ? " " She does n't care . As long as it 's not at school . " Of course , that was a lie . But I figured if he was going to ask me to steal things , I might as well get something in return . He nodded like the deal made sense . " All right . I was just checking . But do n't go overboard . If you cuss all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He went back to reading the package . " I counted in my head , " I told him . " There 's no way I was in there two minutes . " He did n't say anything , so I craned my neck and tried to look him straight in the eye . " You did n't really time me , did you ? " He sighed and jerked his thumb back over his shoulder in the direction of the empty road . " Well , I had to keep a look out . " He walked over to the car and tossed the stuff into the open window . He turned my way again and waved his hand through the air . " Come on out of there . " I tried to slide the rest of the way through the door , but my ass was stuck again . This time I could n't work it free . " I ca n't . " " What do you mean , you ca n't ? " " I mean I 'm stuck . " Lyndell grabbed my arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried holding my breath , blowing it all out , sucking in my stomach , tightening my butt , the whole nine yards . " I ca n't move either way , now . I think my legs are falling asleep . " Lyndell stepped back and observed the situation . " Well , what the hell did you do , eat a T-bone steak while you were in there ? " He stood above me for a moment , thinking . He took a look at me and then the Chevelle . His eyes lingered on the car . " If you leave me , I 'll tell on you . " He pulled his Kools out of his jacket pocket and smiled . " You would n't rat out your old man , would you ? " " Does a hobby horse have a hickory dick ? " Lyndell laughed . " Hey , where 'd you hear that one ? " " From Nick . " He shook his head , still smiling . " I bet you did n't know he heard it from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 'd be a bigger kick if I was n't stuck in this door . " " All right , then . Just hold your damn horses . " He went to the car and grabbed his tire iron from the trunk , then he walked back over and sized up the problem . The tire iron dangled at his side . " I guess this guy , Wilson , hates to see you with one of those . " Lyndell gazed down and chuckled , then he squatted and went to work . By the time he 'd finished hacking up the door , a good-size hunting dog could have scampered through the hole . I crawled right out , stood up , and brushed off my jeans . Lyndell held the tire iron up in the air and grinned . " Now that 's what you call an all-purpose tool . " We ended up on Green Lake Road that night . It was a crooked two-lane running along the banks of the lake . There were no other cars out , so Lyndell took it upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 , the pine trees streaming past us like fence posts . Every now and then there 'd be a break in the trees , and I 'd catch a glimpse of the lake . Lyndell plucked the cigarette lighter out of the ashtray and held the orange tip to a fresh stick . He glanced my way , smoke filling the air . " You like cars ? " he asked . " They 're all right . " " Well , you do n't sound too committed . " " It 's not like I can drive . " " Says who ? " " You ever heard of the police ? " Lyndell waved his hand through the air . " You do n't need a damn license to be able to drive . I know plenty of drivers who do n't have a license . Most of them can drive better than the people who do have one . Even when they 're drunk . " He flung us around the curve , pressing me up against the door . He caught a little bit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run over a squirrel . Lyndell dropped the Muncie into fourth and jumped on the gas again . " Well , what else ? " he asked . " What do you like to do ? " " I do n't know . " " Well , you got ta like something . " " I do n't like school , if that 's what you 're getting at . " " Shit , no , " he said , " that 's not what I 'm getting at . I just mean for fun . If you 've got a day to kill , what would you do with it ? " Only one thing came to mind . " I 'd probably watch TV . " Lyndell smiled , nodded . " You get that from Claudia . I remember when we bought our first Emerson . Hell , I could n't get her out from in front of it . She 'd sit there all day with Nick in her arms , watching those soaps . " " She 's still like that , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day at three , watching those Quartermaines . " He laughed . " I never cared much for the soaps . I do like that Love , American Style show . That 's a good one . That , and Flip Wilson . " He asked what shows I liked best . I took him down the list , starting with the eight o'clock programs . Gunsmoke , Bonanza , Mod Squad , Emergency ! I also made sure I mentioned Georgia Championship Wrestling , which conflicted with one of Claudia 's favorites , Hee Haw . Sometimes , she 'd blackmail me and force me to sing that " Gloom , Despair and Agony " song from Hee Haw just for the privilege of watching wrestling . For some reason , she got a kick out of hearing me sing it . I thought the whole thing bordered on psychological abuse . " Who 's your favorite wrestler ? " Lyndell asked . " I like Buddy Colt . Him and Mr. Wrestling Number Two . " " What about the Funk Brothers ? " " They 're all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That stuff 's fake , you know . " " Yeah , I know . Claudia met one of those guys at the fish camp . " " Who ? A wrestler ? " " Yeah . His name 's Rowland , but he wrestles as Big Boy Brown . He 's not on TV , though , so you would n't know him . " Lyndell frowned . He did n't speak for a moment , but he kept glancing over at me like he was hoping I 'd say something . " So is that her boyfriend ? " " Who , Rowland ? " " Rowland . Big Boy . Whatever the hell he goes by . " " Nah , Claudia only went out with him twice . She said he 'd landed on his head one too many times . " Lyndell nodded . He was staring out over the hood again . " So I guess she meets a lot of men at the fish camp . " My heart gave my rib cage a little tap-tap-tap , just to let me know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not many , " I lied . He cast a suspicious glance in my direction . " Claudia 's an awfully pretty woman , " he said . " You might not have noticed that , seeing how she 's your mother . But other men notice . " " Lee Gordon said she reminded him of a young Angie Dickinson . " " Who 's that ? " " She was in that John Wayne picture , Rio Bravo , and the one with Burt Reynolds , Sam Whiskey . " Lyndell shook his head . " Hell , I know who Angie Dickinson is . I mean , who the hell is Lee Gordon ? " " Oh , he 's the manager at the Big Star . He plays that stand-up bass in the Green Lake Gang . " Lyndell was getting all puffed up , like he wanted to fight somebody . He was squeezing the steering wheel extra tight . " I do n't know him , but he 's a damn idiot . She do n't look a thing like Angie Dickinson , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Angie Dickinson . " " You jealous or something ? " He snorted , but without a whole lot of conviction . " Hell , no , I 'm not jealous . Me and Claudia have an understanding about these things . I just wan na make sure she does n't get mixed up with the wrong guy . " " She said there 's a lot of men who are lucky she 's not a big singing star . " " Why 's that ? " " Because she could sing some real mean songs about them . " Lyndell got quiet for a moment . He switched off the radio in an agitated way . Roger Miller , one of his all-time favorites , had been singing . Even Claudia liked Roger Miller . Hell , even I liked Roger Miller . " Well , I sure hope she was n't including me on that list , " Lyndell said . " I might not be perfect , but I 've always had her best interests at heart . " We never got around to swimming in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever together . Lyndell eventually found work at a garage . He had a habit of going in late and coming home even later . I do n't believe Claudia ever saw much money from him , but she was always friendly enough toward him . They played gin sometimes in the evenings , Claudia whipping Lyndell 's ass time and again while the radio played . " Goddammit , this game ai n't nothing but luck . " Lyndell fired his hand down on the table after another futile effort . He turned in his chair , crossed his legs , and lit a cigarette . Claudia smiled and winked at me . I 'd been sitting there pretending to read one of my schoolbooks . " Poor Lyndell , " she said , " he 's lost his touch . " Lyndell had his arms crossed . He was sulking and drawing the life out of his Kool . " The thing is , " she said to me , " he 's the one who taught me to play this game . Taught me years ago , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it much . " Claudia never stopped seeing other men while Lyndell was staying with us . Sometimes , on fish camp nights , she would n't come home until five in the morning . Lyndell would have stumbled in long before her , a quart of Schlitz in his hand , his face and clothes caked in the red powder from the dirt track . We 'd fall asleep together on the sofa , watching the TV in the dark , James Brown 's Future Shock and then the monster movies on channel 17 . Lyndell was a big James Brown fan . One Sunday , I woke up to Lyndell and Claudia arguing . It was the only time I ever heard them raise their voices at each other . Lyndell was back in Claudia 's bedroom . " You 're just doing this to get back at me , " he said . " It 's nothing but spite . " I tiptoed down the hall and gazed through the crack in the doorway . Claudia was standing there wrapped in a towel , still wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dressed in his racing clothes from the night before . Claudia flicked the towel with her thumb and let it fall to her feet . She stood there in front of him naked . I turned away as fast as I could . " It 's not spite , " she said , her voice cool and measured . " It 's called blowing your chance . And you blew it twice . So , take a look , Lyndell . Get your eyes full . Because all you 're gon na have is a memory . " Lyndell did n't have anything else to say . We kept up the late-night car rides . Lyndell would come in and wake me a couple times a week . At school , I would daydream about the Chevelle , the smell and the feel of the engine when it threw my head back against the seat . I drew pictures of it in my notebook . I pictured myself on the dirt track , behind the wheel , banging fenders on the last lap . Lyndell had taken me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . He 'd set me up in the stands with a funnel cake and a Coke . He had n't made the feature race on either occasion , but he had n't wrecked , either . It was about the most fun I 'd ever had . I realized that the only thing better than one loud , fast car was a whole bunch of them driving in circles together . One of the best things about our car rides was hearing Lyndell tell stories about his own father , C.W. It was C.W. who had taught Lyndell to drive in his ' 39 Ford Coupe , the same car that C.W. used to run liquor down from north Georgia to Atlanta . Lyndell was barely twelve when he started driving that car . " It 's best to learn young , " he said . " Why 's that ? " I asked . He thought for a moment , then shrugged . " Hell , I do n't know . It just is . " Lyndell had all sorts of C.W. stories . C.W. winning illegal stock car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at pool and then fighting his way out of the bar with a cue stick . My favorite tale involved the time he was hauling ass through Buford after dropping off a load of whiskey . The deputy pulled him over and walked up to the window , whereupon C.W. presented him with a twenty-dollar bill . The deputy gave C.W. a puzzled look and said , " Goddamn , C.W. After all the times we 've done this , you should know a speeding ticket only costs ten dollars . " C.W. just nodded his head , one foot still riding the clutch and the other revving the motor . " I am fully aware , " he said . " But seeing how I plan to be in a big hurry when I come back through here tonight , I 'd like to go ahead and pay the other fine up front . " Lyndell had promised to let me drive the Chevelle before he moved out . When that time came , he drove us out to Green Lake Road this particular night , pulled onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon was high and full and white as a marble . George Jones was singing " The Race Is On . " " I 'm probably rushing things here a little , " Lyndell said , " but it 's now or fucking never . " I knew what he was getting at . " I 'm ready . " He considered my face and my hands . " Are you scared ? " For some reason , I decided to be truthful . " A little bit . " He smiled and nodded . " That 's good . A little fear is a good thing . It 'll keep you alert . I guarantee you Richard Petty gets a little nervous before races . " He pressed in the cigarette lighter and waited for it to catch fire . He already had the Kool dangling from his lips . " Are you planning to leave or something ? " I asked . He turned down the radio a little and pulled the cigarette out of his mouth . " It 's kind of looking that way , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , and the racing season 's almost over . Plus , I got an offer to work at this race shop up in Bristol . " " Does Claudia know ? " " Yeah , she knows . I think she 'll be glad to have me gone . " He got a concerned look on his face . " Are you okay with it ? " I thought about my room , empty and dark , and how I did n't want to be there , how I could have spent every night like this . We sat there a moment longer . I kept waiting for him to open the door so we could switch sides , but he never made a move in that direction . He still had his hand draped over the wheel , staring out the windshield like he was trying to spot something up ahead of the high beams . I asked him what he saw . He grunted and shook his head like he was trying to clear some things out of his mind . He pulled the Lem Motlow out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pop . " I was just thinking , " he said .

" The lighter finally clicked , and he whipped it out and sparked his Kool with it . " I do n't think that 's why Nick got into trouble , " I said . " He told me it was because some guy turned state 's evidence on him . " Lyndell smiled . " Yeah , I know all about that . I 'm just talking about something different . What Claudia was hoping is that maybe I could teach you some things , maybe give you an idea of how a man should act , so you would n't get into any trouble yourself . She thought it might be a way for me to sort of make amends . " He studied my face . Something about it seemed to frighten him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a damn thing , did I ? " I dug really deep , hoping I could bail him out . I could tell it was important to him . " A tire iron comes in pretty handy , " I said . " That 's one thing . " He laughed , but soon he was frowning . I started to worry he might change his mind about letting me drive . " Do n't worry , " I said , " I 'm not gon na get thrown in jail when I grow up . I only had detention seven times last year . This kid , Marty Atkins , got it twenty-three times . I heard Mr. Rogers , the principal , say that Marty was gon na make a good convict one day . " Lyndell sat there a while longer , squeezing the steering wheel . " There 's something I want to tell you , " he said . " What 's that ? " He had a real serious look on his face , like he was about to pass along some grave news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's about C.W. , " he said . " It 's about those stories I told you . " " What about them ? " " Well , they 're all a bunch of shit , basically . I stole them from other people . " He turned and blew his smoke out the side window . " Truth is , C.W. was n't no character . He was just a drunk , an outlaw , a womanizer . Pretty much a sonuvabitch , really . " He looked at me and draped his arm across the back of the seat . His eyes were wide and remorseful . " You know , he sent me out one time to set fire to a man 's sugar sacks . It was another moonshiner , a mean-ass sonuvabitch who 'd have just as soon gutted you as look at you . He 'd short-changed C.W. on a run , and C.W. wanted to get back at him . I was n't much older than you at the time , but I knew that sugar was something a moonshiner would kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the woods , and it was late at night . I told C.W. I was scared . I told him I did n't want to do it . But he just looked at his car . He said , ' It 's a long walk home , boy . A long walk . ' " I felt bad for Lyndell . At least he had n't left me behind at the auto supply store . He took another drink out of the bottle . He was getting near the bottom . " You know , I used to take Nick out like this . That was back before you were born . " He squinted his eyes , thinking hard , trying to keep the history straight . " Actually , I guess we were in the process of making you . That 's when me and Claudia had our second go-round . That 's before she 'd had enough of me . " " Did you ever let Nick drive ? " " Oh , yeah . Sure , I did . I had me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . " Lyndell whistled and shook his head . " Good Lord , he scared the shit out of me . Took this turn too fast and spun us around . We ended up in the front yard of this old shack with some sonuvabitch 's mailbox lying on the hood of the car . The lights come on in the house , and then this man and woman step out onto the porch . I look over at Nick , and I 'm expecting him to be scared to death . But that little rascal was already trying to get the car started . He fired up that sonuvabitch and lit off down the road with the mailbox still on the hood . He finally looked over at me , and he said , ' Lyndell , the mail service sure ai n't what it used to be . ' " We both laughed . All I could see was Nick with his grown-up head and long hair , but a kid 's body and a little leather motorcycle jacket . " Now that story is the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest truth . " " It 's a good one , " I said . He drank the last of the bourbon , reached out the side window and hooked the bottle over the top of the car . It bounced down the hill , finally clanking against some rocks near the lake 's edge . " I never did get around to telling Nick the truth about C.W. , " he said . " I 've been wondering if that might have done some good . " He gave me this aching look . A few years would have to pass before I could recognize someone casting out for a reassuring word . All I knew then was that he seemed to be waiting for me to say something . So I asked a question that I 'd always wanted answered . It felt like as good a time as any to ask . " Do you and Claudia love each other ? " He took a hard pull on his Kool and blew out the smoke . He watched the cloud rise as if it might hold the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just a complicated thing . It 's not as simple as those songs Claudia likes , where somebody 's always to blame for things going wrong . " He let out a sigh . The music was barely trickling from the dashboard , Glen Campbell singing " Wichita Lineman . " " You meet somebody , " he said , " and then you fall in love with them because they give you something you ai n't ever had before . But the mean part of love is that , after a while , you find yourself needing other things . So you go out looking for it from somebody else . Hell , everybody does it . They might say they do n't , but they 're full of shit . And the church folk , they 're the worst of all about it . " He flicked his cigarette onto the road and rolled up the window . " So , why do you keep coming back ? " It was almost like I 'd pulled a gun on him . He drew back from me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared off into the distance , searching for words . " I do n't know , " he said . " It 's like I was her first , and I ca n't help thinking I should have been the only one . " He looked at me again . " But I suppose I already had my chance at that . At least that 's what Claudia says . " He left after that night . He went up to Bristol , Tennessee , and took the job working on engines at the race shop . Several years later , he married the daughter of the man who owned the racing team . They even had a baby girl together . I was fifteen when Claudia told me all of this . She said she 'd gotten the news from Carl Bettis , one of Lyndell 's old racing buddies who worked at the Amoco . " Can you even picture that ? " she asked . " Lyndell Fulmer working a full-time job and keeping up a family ? They say he 's even quit drinking . " Truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of years . I meant no offense by it . He 'd just become like an old , broken piece of furniture that you move out to the garage with every good intention of reclaiming one day . Problem is you end up setting something else in front of it , and then another thing , and another , and pretty soon you 've forgotten all about that one chair . Besides , I had other things on my mind just then , namely selling a nickel bag of pot at the 7-Eleven and getting my driver 's license when the official date rolled around the coming spring . I was doing a little dealing of my own with Marty Atkins , trying to save money for a car that I could fix up to race at the speedway . Not that I was exactly on the fast track to ownership . My pot operation was small stakes , most of the inventory consisting of weed that I stole from Nick 's house . Nick was on parole at the time , following a second round of incarceration over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from a twenty-year sentence . " Are you mad at Lyndell ? " I asked . " Of course not , " Claudia said . " You should never begrudge someone their happiness . " She looked like the saddest person in the world when she spoke those words . I pushed my chair away from the kitchen table . I stood and watched Claudia . She was leaning against the door , looking down , fingering the frayed edges of her hat brim . " All right , " she said . " I 'll probably be late tonight . " And then she left . The house was awfully quiet . I walked over to the sink and switched on the radio . It was already tuned to the country station . I did n't recognize the song that was playing , but it sounded sad , a pedal steel guitar driving slowly and plaintively across a bridge . I switched the radio back off , stopping the lyrics before they ever caught up to me . I ca n't say if it was about a man or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning , drinking , or dying . For all I know it might have been about love itself , how it can be a complicated and mean companion . Continues ...
