A wide-brimmed hat the color of wet sand shielded the archaeologist 's eyes from the sun and made it difficult for the cameraman to get a good shot of his face . The man worked steadily and carefully , sifting dirt and picking out what looked like unremarkable shards of pottery , all the while oblivious to the film crew around him . <p> " Wes , look up once in a while , okay ? " Annja Creed stood back far enough so her shadow would not encroach . " We 've been over this a few times , " she reminded her colleague . <p> " Yeah , yeah . No worries . " The archaeologist tipped his head up and smiled , showing an even row of bright white teeth that contrasted sharply with his well-tanned skin and scruffy beard . He winked at her . <p> " Ah , sometimes I do n't know Christmas from Bourke Street , Miss Creed , " he replied . " I get my head into this and I forget all else . " <p> Annja put Wes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his face unlined and his eyes bright . He was dressed in the traditional khaki pants most archaeologists wore , but his shirt was a brilliant lake-blue , new and with sharp creases ; he 'd worn a new shirt each day of the shoot , and had polished his shoes . He 'd stubbornly refused to give his age and many other details about his personal life , saying , " I do n't need the world to know all of that , Miss Creed . I 'm not important . This site is , though . " <p> She could have gotten all the biographical information she wanted for her piece from the foundation funding the dig  --  about Dr. Wesley Michaels , his wife and the handful of other archaeologists . She could have gotten Wes 's age , weight , favorite beverage , and even the name of his first pet if she 'd pressed . But he was right the site deserved the spotlight . <p> " Besides , do n't you have enough pictures of me , Miss Creed ? I thought you finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to his sifting , the angle of his hat again obscuring his face . <p> Annja loved to hear Wes talk . He had a thick Australian accent , perhaps exaggerated for her benefit . <p> " Just about finished , Dr. Michaels , " the cameraman pronounced . " A few more pans , Annja , and it 'll be a wrap , as they say . " <p> " Thanks , Oliver . " Annja pointed to the north . " Could you get some more on the skeletons , please . That fellow working over there by himself . He 's uncovered quite a bit this morning . You can see the whole skull now . " <p> Oliver made a face . " More bone shots . Sure . " <p> The archaeologists labored in a long bowl-like depression , concentrating on a section of midden at the base of a hill , a layer of soil that was stained dark by the decomposition of refuse left behind by people who lived a long time ago . The southern section had fragments of stone tools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which obviously fascinated Wes . He was attentive with even the smallest piece . <p> Annja watched him with detached envy . It was a fascinating dig , and a part of her wished she was working it , not just hosting a television segment highlighting the site . Three and a half days of filming and interviews for a one-hour slot on Chasing History 's Monsters . She held back a laugh ; there 'd been no monsters here in this desolate stretch in a forest preserve northwest of Sydney , but she knew her producer would fabricate one . He 'd come up with some beast that supposedly either lured the ancient Egyptians to Australia or prevented them from leaving  --  some creature that had enough myths and legends swirling around it to attract good viewing numbers . <p> The features of the midden drew Annja 's thoughts back . Discolorations spoke of the human impact here , such as spots where posts had been set for houses and hearths had been dug for cooking . Most fascinating were the unearthed stones covered with carvings . <p> Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , claiming they were merely unusual aboriginal petroglyphs . She 'd seen plenty of petroglyphs in books and on various Internet sites , and pictographs  --  paintings on rocks that usually held some religious meaning . She had to side with Wes . They certainly did look like Egyptian hieroglyphs . One of the more distinct carvings was of a slight woman with the head of a cow . One of her arms was stretched above her head ; the other arm had been chopped off when the stone broke . <p> " Hathor , " Wes had explained . " The wife of Horus . She was an ancient goddess , dating to dynastic times , maybe earlier . Nothing aboriginal about her and Horus . " <p> Annja and her crew had agreed not to give the exact location of the dig . Wes and the foundation had been adamant about that . They had enough problems with errant hikers trudging over out of curiosity . Too much publicity would mean they 'd have to up their security to protect against looters and tourists , and that would cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> There was a second dig about a mile away , on the other side of the ridge in a lightly wooded section . Smaller and not nearly as interesting as this , Annja thought , though certainly part of the same ancient city . University of Sydney graduate students were working there to uncover more hieroglyphs . A third Egyptian dig was taking place near Brisbane , and Annja had lobbied to visit that site , too , as it was the most recent . But her producer cited timing and money , and so she had grudgingly settled solely on Dr. Michaels 's team . <p> " This is all considered fringe archaeology anyway , " Doug Morrell had argued , because not all the experts agreed it was Egyptian . Not worth too much airtime , but certainly worth some , he had said . Normally , the hint of some monster triggered her assignment . This time , it was a leak that a rival television show was going to send a team to the dig . Doug had admitted wanting the scoop on the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things being unearthed , the dryness of the ground and the tinge of sweat from the archaeologists . She thought maybe she 'd come back here on her own before the year was out and see what progress had been made . <p> Wes Michaels hoped to get the results of some radiocarbon dating before Annja and her crew finished . Using the known half-life of carbon 14 , and measuring the amount of undecayed carbon in a plant specimen his wife had uncovered at the bottom of a bowl , Wes hoped to determine the age of the features of this site . Annja knew geochronology would also help  --  dating artifacts by the age of the geological formation they were discovered in . But those test results were still hanging . <p> Wes had explained to Annja that a handful of curators and computer programmers were cataloging what had already been taken away from the site and were storing them in a museum in Sydney . He had offered to show her some of the more interesting specimens locked away there . She thought maybe she 'd take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fringe nothing , Miss Creed . I 'm not an Egyptologist , but I do n't need to be to tell me that 's indeed Hathor . " Wes held up a curved piece of pottery on which was painted a complete image of the cow-headed woman . " Look , she 's on several pieces here . " <p> Annja watched her cameraman work at the far end of the midden , where an archaeologist who looked little more than a teenager continued to brush the dirt away from a skeleton . The rest of her crew was packing up . <p> " What do you know of Hathor ? " Annja knelt next to Wes Michaels and noted his gaze lingering on her lithe form . He might be a married man , she thought , but that did n't prevent him from looking . <p> " The mistress of turquoise , she was called . Mistress of the entrance to the valley , queen of the west , lady of the sycamore , lady of all the gods , the gold of the gods . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned his gaze to the pottery piece . " Goddess of women , music , beauty , love , joyall the important things in this world were her purview . They believed she blessed women with fertility . Some say the Greeks recognized her , as well , some sort of relation to Aphrodite . " <p> " The primal mother , " Jennifer said as she joined them . Hair tucked under a bushman 's hat , and nose smeared with sunscreen , she was equally difficult to pin an age to . Annja thought she was overly thin , elbows and wrist bones protruding . " Hathor was said to have some erotic significance to the Egyptian culture . " She playfully nudged her husband . <p> " Say no more . Say no more , " he shot back . <p> Jennifer continued , " Her symbols include the sistra . It 's sort of a rattle , and we 've found two of them here . Hathor was especially prominent in Ta-Netjer . " <p> " The Land of God , " Wes translated . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to another image of Hathor on a stone . " Her priests were male and female , dancers , musicians . Some were midwives , and it was said Hathor 's oracles could interpret people 's dreams . " <p> Wes passed Annja the pottery piece he 'd been studying . " Careful with it , " he instructed . Then he shook his head and frowned , realizing he need make no such admonition to her . <p> " Primal mother , you called her ? " Annja mused . <p> Wes opened his mouth to answer , but Jennifer clicked her teeth , as much as telling him this question was hers to field . " The Egyptians believed that the world began when the great floods retreated , and at that time Hathor slipped from the reeds and stood on the first patch of dry ground . The first day of the ancient year was considered her birthday , and they celebrated it with a lavish festival . Before dawn , they 'd tote her statue onto the roof of her temple at Dendra . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her husband , could shine on the statue , thus representing the marriage of the sun and the sky . " <p> Jennifer beamed at Annja 's knowledge . " But it was n't all light , " she said . <p> " No . " Annja scowled . " If I remember my studies , she had a few dark roles , too . Some say she was also the goddess Sekhmet , and in that guise she exacted a blood toll on mankind . " She returned the pottery piece to Wes . " A temple at Kom el-Hism in the Middle Kingdom was dedicated to Sekhmet-Hathor . " Maybe there was the monster angle . Sekhmet down under , Annja mused . <p> " Indeed ! " Jennifer said . " In one of Tutankhamen 's shrines , they discovered a carving that tells how Hathor became Sekhmet at her father 's , Ra 's , urging . She nearly wiped out humanity , but she finally went back to being Hathor and stopped the massacre . A smart one , you are , Miss Creed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annja politely ignored the invitation . " Was n't Hathor said to accept the dead at the gates of the west ? " <p> " Now , that role was n't dark ! " Wes snorted . " The goddess greeted them at the gates with bread and beer . Hope it was a pint of Tooheys . " <p> Annja could n't help but laugh with him . " I will be back , " she told him . " Without a cameraman . " <p> After a few moments she drifted away to another section of the dig , leaving Wes and his wife to discuss the pottery shards and the mother goddess . " And maybe I 'll try a Tooheys myself tonight , " Annja called back to them . <p> Three members of the five-man film crew were leaving on a red-eye flight . But she and Oliver were scheduled to fly out the next day around noon . So tonight she 'd settle back with her laptop in her hotel room in Sydney  --  after a good meal , of course , and that Tooheys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidbits about Hathor . Maybe she 'd search the fringe sites , too . <p> She made a mental note to also look into the Brisbane dig . The theories she 'd already read about the Australian sites suggested that thousands of years ago Egyptians had sailed here looking for gold , and that the aboriginals who lived here at the time were said to have heard the beating hearts of all the ships , likely the drums that kept the oarsmen in time . <p> Could Wes Michaels come up with enough evidence to silence the skeptics and prove that the Egyptians really did reach Australian soil before Captain Cook ? <p> Lost in thought , Annja nearly tripped over one of the archaeologists . <p> " No room for bludgers here , eh , cobber ? " A lanky archaeologist raised his eyebrows when Annja caught herself from falling . His face was as smooth and flat as a shovel , and it glistened with sweat in the late-afternoon sun . It was n't a warm day , it being early fall in Australia , but his shirt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his arms . <p> " No bludgers , " Annja admitted . It was Australian slang for a layabout , someone who let others do the work for him . <p> " Your cameraman caught Josie napping yesterday , Miss Creed , and that 's been sitting in my craw . I complained to Dr. Michaels about it , but I bet he did n't say anything to you . Did he ? " <p> Annja shook her head . <p> " It 'll make us all look like lazy louts . Not one of us is a bludger . Josie 's just got a touch of the flu is all . Still under it , she is . " He wiped the back of his hand across his forehead , smearing the dirt . <p> Annja offered the archaeologist a weak smile . " Oliver 's just wrapping , " she said . " We 're heading back to Sydney within the hour . " <p> " He did n't need to film Josie taking a little snooze , " the man persisted . He gestured to the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was mostly dead . Josie , the oldest archaeologist , was sitting against the trunk . " Josie there is gon na make us all look  --  " <p> " I would n't worry about it . " Annja poked out her lower lip and let out a long breath that fluttered her hair . " It 's a one-hour show , and we 're interested in the hieroglyphics , nothing else . " Annja would n't go so far as to promise that the snoozing archaeologist would n't appear in the segment . She 'd long ago learned not to make any promises regarding Chasing History 's Monsters . <p> " One hour 's all ? " the man asked . <p> She nodded . She 'd thought she 'd explained that to everyone . <p> " Dr. Michaels 'll be mad as a cut snake , Miss Creed . I 'll wager he figures that as many days as you 've been out here you were putting together some sort of series like those Alaskan crab fishermen have . Make him a local celebrity . Get him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Annja feigned interest in something on the rise and headed in that direction . " One hour is all , " she called out . There was a tinge of irritation in her voice  --  both at the archaeologist 's complaints and the shortness of the segment . This site was worthy of much more than a one-hour piece  --  many of the places she visited were worthy of more . But television had its limits , she realized . She just did n't have to like them . <p> She spied Oliver at the top of the ridge , taking a few shots of the student dig in the distance . Probably going to compare its small size to the professional dig here if there was room , she thought . " Yep . Only one bloody hour , " she mumbled . <br> Continues ...
