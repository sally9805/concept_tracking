Rafe McKettrick peered at the small , tasteful advertisement in the back of the Cattleman 's Journal , dog-eared the page , and then slammed the magazine against the edge of the desk in his father 's study . It was a desperate measure , sending away for a bride , the way a person might send away for a book , or a custom-made belt buckle , but then , Rafe was a desperate man . He had no doubt whatsoever that his father had meant precisely what he 'd said that day at dinner ; Angus was not the sort to make idle threats . Rafe neither knew nor wanted any other life than the one he had , right there on the Triple M , and he 'd be damned if he 'd spend the rest of his days dancing to whatever tune Kade or Jeb chose to play . Which meant he needed a wife , pronto , and if he got her in the family way on the way home from the church , so much the better . Pushing back the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out a sheet of the fancy vellum stationery his pa used for business correspondence . With great ceremony , he selected a pen , opened a bottle of India ink , and ordered his thoughts . Some moments had passed when he began to write . To Whom It May Concern , Please send one wife . Healthy , with good teeth . Able to read and write . And cook . Must want children . Soon . Rafe McKettrick Triple M Ranch , near Indian Rock , Arizona Territory Rafe read the note over a couple of times , decided it could not be improved upon in any significant way , folded the page , and jammed it into an envelope , along with a draft drawn on thebank in town . Nothing to do but slap on a stamp and get the letter onto a stagecoach headed east . He frowned as he copied out the address . The few times he 'd had occasion to send a letter , he 'd simply entrusted it to whoever happened to be heading into town next , but this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home Matrimonial Service " right there on the front of the envelope , for everybody to see , and that alone was fodder enough for a merciless ribbing from every other man on the ranch . For another , he did n't want either of his brothers to beat him to the punch by swiping his letter , copying his idea , or both . No , sir , Rafe reflected , leaning back in the chair , tucking the missive into his vest pocket , he 'd post it himself , personally . Ride all the way down to Indian Rock and meet the outgoing stagecoach . He sighed , closed his eyes , and kicked his feet up onto the desk . He reckoned it would n't be so bad , having a wife . He 'd have a woman right there handy , on a cold night , and that was no mean blessing in a place as isolated and lonesome as the Triple M. He 'd get her to expecting before the ink dried in the family Bible , and that would be that . The ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kade and Jeb would either have to do his bidding or saddle up and ride . He knew they 'd never leave  --  the place was in their blood , the way it was in his  --  and he smiled at the thought of working them like a pair of field horses . He 'd have them dig a new hole for the privy first , then shovel lime into the old one . The bunkhouse roof needed replacing come spring  --  they 'd be damned lucky if it held up through the coming winter  --  and of course he and the missus would want an addition built on to the main house , so they could have a little privacy . While Jeb had been working to repair the boundary fences , many of them needed to be replaced , and up on the northern boundary there was timber to be cut . While his brothers were sweating over the chores he would outline for them , he would ride out looking for the fine roan stallion he 'd seen haunting the red canyons like a ghost , but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mark the beginning of his own herd . Somebody slapped his feet off the desk , and he sat bolt upright , with a sputtered curse , startled half out of his skin and ready to fight . Kade , two years younger at twenty-seven , was gazing down at him . " What were you thinking about just then , Big Brother ? " he asked in a slow drawl . He perched on the edge of the desk and folded his arms , eyes narrowed . " Why , from the look on your face , I 'd say you were up to no good . " Rafe was glad he 'd slipped the letter into his vest pocket , where it was out of sight . He laid splayed fingers to his chest and feigned an injured expression . " What 's this ? You do n't trust me , Little Brother ? " " Not unless he 's stupid , he does n't , " put in Jeb , from the doorway , his mouth curved into one of those wry grins that always made Rafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me , I 'd sooner trust a polecat . " He stepped into the study , closed the door behind him . The large room seemed to shrink , with all of them there ; Rafe considered getting up to open a window , but he was n't about to risk losing the chair he already thought of as his own . He did sit up straight , though , planting his boots squarely on the floor . Kade turned , watched their youngest brother approach , drag up a chair of his own . Sit . He moved languidly , Jeb did , as if his bones were fitted loosely at the joints . He was the best broncobuster on the ranch  --  Rafe and Kade had seen their little brother thrown from many a horse , and most of the time he landed on his feet . " What are we going to do ? " Jeb asked , serious now , resting one foot on the opposite knee . " This is n't just another of his tangents , you know . Pa meant what he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded . He was the quiet , mannerly brother , the thoughtful one , the reader and resident quoter of poetry , the one you had to watch like a ring-tailed snake . " I believe he did , " he agreed . " It 's got to do with his birthday . He 's feeling old . " " Hell , " Rafe said , " he is old . " Jeb chuckled , shook his head . " Tell that to that ranch hand he caught beating one of the mares with a switch last week , " he said . " The fella 's still laid up over there at Daisy 's rooming house . Doc says it might be spring before the poor bastard can hit the trail . " Kade grinned . " Daisy , " he said . " Now there 's a prospective bride . Why do n't you go sparking her , Rafe ? " " I 'd sooner take up with an old sow bear , " Rafe answered , and he was serious as a Montana winter . Daisy Pert was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed more than a loaded hay wagon and had two teeth in her head , both of them bad . She chewed snoose , and anyway , she was sweet on the circuit preacher 's cross-eyed brother , Lemuel , who feared her more than the devil himself . " I think Rafe 's got something up his sleeve , " Kade speculated smoothly . The cadence of his voice was light , but there was a quiet , brotherly menace in it that you had to listen hard to hear . He leaned in a little . " Do n't you , Rafe ? " Rafe did his damnedest to look innocent . He had n't polished the skill over the years , so it did n't come easy , the way fighting , shooting , and riding did . " What makes you say a thing like that ? " he asked . " Just a feeling , " Kade answered evenly , taking in the splotches of fresh ink drying on the blotter . " And twenty-seven years of experience . " Just then , the double doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a storm cloud coming over the rise , burdened with bad weather and bristling with lightning bolts . Rafe , who had been expecting their father , was only slightly relieved ; this did n't look like much of a reprieve to him . Concepcion turned with immeasurable dignity , latched the two doors , and when she faced them again , her dark eyes were blazing . " How could you ? " she seethed . " How could you forget such an important day ? " Jeb stood , if belatedly , his blue eyes dancing with mischief , and gestured for Concepcion to take his chair . " I ca n't speak for my brothers , " he said , " but it just so happens that I did remember . " Kade and Rafe glared at him . " Like hell you did , " Rafe said . " I 've got a book upstairs , wrapped up fancy and tied with a ribbon , just for Pa , " Jeb told them . " You bought that for that new hurdy-gurdy girl that just hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plopped into the chair , singed the short hairs on Kade and Rafe with a single scorching glance . The look she gave Jeb was only slightly less incendiary ; clearly , she was skeptical about his story , but willing to give him the benefit of a doubt . Females were always inclined to give that rascal the benefit of a doubt , it seemed to Rafe . Jeb 's smile became a smirk , and he gave a cocky shrug . " Think what you like , " he told his brothers . " Sit down , " Concepcion told him smartly , " and shut your mouth . " Jeb grimaced and sat on the raised hearth , his hands loosely clasped and dangling between his knees . Kade shifted his attention from the ceiling to the floor , and Rafe fixed his eyes on a point just above Concepcion 's left shoulder . " Do you know what I think ? " she rattled on , shaking that familiar finger , taking them all in . Rafe figured they were about to get some clarification on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your father is right . It 's time you were settled down , all of you , with homes and families of your own . " Kade was the first to break . He gave a long sigh . " I forgot that it was Pa 's birthday , " he admitted . " All the same , I do n't see what that has to do with  --  " Concepcion turned huffy . " If you thought about something besides books , bad women , and horses , " she accused , " you would realize that you are wasting your life . " When Jeb and Rafe grinned , enjoying Kade 's discomfort , she turned on them , fierce as a she-wolf . " You think you are any better , either of you ? " She made a spitting sound , purely Latin and very expressive . " You , Rafe , with your temper and your brawling ? You , Jeb , with your card-playing ? " Kade raised both hands , palms out , in a gesture of surrender . Rafe set his jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while that he 'd never succeed . " I guess , " Jeb said meekly , breaking the ominous silence , " I 'll just go and give Pa the birthday present I got him . " " You set one foot out of this room , " Kade warned , in a furious undertone , " and I 'll take a layer of hide off you , right here and right now . " Jeb flushed and shot to his feet , fists clenched , always ready for a fight . Concepcion was quick , though , due to long practice , and she got between him and Kade before either of them could throw a punch . Being the youngest , Jeb usually got himself whupped in these little set-tos , but he kept trying anyhow . " That is enough , " Concepcion said , in a tone no one could have mistaken for anything but utter sincerity . Jeb laid his hands on her shoulders , turned her around , and made calf eyes at her . " Concepcion , " he said , sweet as pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of my children ? " For a moment , there was silence , reminiscent of those few seconds of shock that come just after a wasp 's sting and right before the venom starts to spread . A cracking sound followed , and Jeb 's face glowed red where Concepcion had slapped him . " No more , " she fumed , all fury and fire . Rafe and Kade looked at each other , stifling their laughter , and just as quickly looked away . " You have broken that fine man 's heart , " Concepcion went on , after pausing to gather herself up like a chicken settling its ruffled feathers . " You are a disappointment , a disgrace . All of you . " They all stared at her . None of them had ever seen her in such a fine dither , and given some of the pranks they 'd pulled over the years , both independently and in cahoots with one another , that was saying something . " Until you start treating your father with the respect he deserves , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I will not cook another bite of food for any of you . I will not sew buttons or make beds or wash clothes . For once in your lives , you can do for yourselves . " With that , she turned , chin at a regal angle , eyes bright with conviction , and swept to the study doors . She worked the latch , flung the doors wide , and stepped through without looking back . " Do you think she meant all that ? " Jeb asked , not so cocksure now . Kade rolled his eyes . " Oh , yeah , " he said , resigned . " She meant it , all right . " Rafe stared at the ceiling , wondering how long it would be before his bride arrived . He did n't fancy cooking his own meals , and he 'd never done a lick of laundry in his life . He 'd best get himself down to Indian Rock and send off that letter . " Pa will never allow it , " Jeb said , grasping at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " For him , " Kade pointed out . " Not us . " Jeb pondered that , looking pained . " Oh . " " We 'd better figure out how to get back on her good side , " Kade speculated . " It 's that or eat in the bunkhouse , and you know what Red 's cooking is like  --  scorched beans for breakfast , dinner , supper , and dessert . " " What do you suggest ? " Rafe asked , without opening his eyes . He was doing his best to keep his spirits up by imagining himself with a wife by his side . In the meantime , he 'd just make do with meals in town . That Chinese fella , Kwan Somebody-or-other , could do his wash once a month . A man just had to be resourceful , that was all . " I 'd suggest , " Kade said , " that we do what Pa wants . We do that , and our problems will be over . " " That goes for one of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that he figured on being that one . " The other two are pretty well screwed . " Rafe did n't comment . " I plan on getting myself married to the first decent woman I can find , " Kade said confidently . " You two need n't worry too much , though . I wo n't make you salute or wear uniforms . You can put in a ten-hour day , like all the other hands , and take off one Sunday a month . " Rafe opened his eyes . " Just who do you figure on marrying ? " he asked , suspicious and more than a little alarmed . Of the three of them , Kade was the craftiest . A fellow never knew what might be going on in that clockwork mind of his . Kade smiled ; butter would n't have melted in his mouth . " Do you really think I 'd be fool enough to tell you ? " he asked . Then , just like that , he strolled out without another word . You 'd have thought he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childbirth , he was so damn sure of himself . Rafe slammed to his feet to follow , and Jeb was right behind him . Out in the large entryway , Kade was buckling on his gunbelt . He took his round-brimmed hat down from the usual hook on the hall tree , stuck it on his head , and reached for his three-quarter-length coat , the one Concepcion said made him look like a drifter and an outlaw . " You headed for town ? " Rafe demanded , brows lowered . Kade straightened his collar , checked the angle of his hat in the wall mirror next to the long-case clock , and offered not a single word in reply . Jeb , meanwhile , was sprinting up the stairs , taking them two at a time . Probably going to get the present he 'd bought for that saloon girl and go toadying to their father , acting like he 'd remembered all along what day it was . Rafe was downright disgusted . His brothers were deceitful men , both of them . He reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt and pistol he kept in the top drawer of the hall bureau . Yes , sir , he 'd just ride on over to Indian Rock , meet the stage , and send out his letter . Before he could say " Shivaree , " his bride would be arriving , ready to set up housekeeping and start a baby . Hell , with a little luck , she might even be halfway presentable . Kansas City , Missouri Emmeline Harding closed the second-story window of Miss Becky 's Boardinghouse with a bang , barely muffling the dusty din of bawling cattle and shouting cowboys choking the street below . Another herd , probably driven up from Texas , headed for the stockyards . Within an hour , the drovers would be streaming in , wanting hot baths , whiskey , and women , though not necessarily in that order . With the help of her " girls , " Becky , Emmeline 's aunt , would see that they were all accommodated . For a price , of course . Emmeline sighed . From a social standpoint  --  essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since she was just a week shy of nineteen  --  she was neither fish nor fowl . Becky had sent her to the best finishing school in the city and kept her well away from the customers  --  and for what ? With all her splendid manners , lovely clothes , and book learning , she was still a pariah , unwelcome in the respectable homes of her former classmates . Life , it seemed to Emmeline , was one big party , and she was n't invited . Standing on the other side of the upstairs parlor , with its bead-trimmed lampshades and velvet drapes , Becky rolled a black fishnet stocking up over one slender leg . She was a beauty , Becky was , with a real head for business , and she 'd been unfailingly kind to Emmeline , protecting her and providing for her ever since infancy , when she 'd been orphaned . Now , Becky watched her niece thoughtfully . " You spinning day dreams again ? " she asked . " No , " Emmeline lied . Often bored and always lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her imagination . There , she 'd constructed a lovely little cottage for herself , and a morally upright husband , too , though he was unknown to her as yet , several rosy-cheeked , golden-haired children , and two rotund cats . The place boasted shutters on the windows and flowers in the yard , and at the base of the walk there was a white gate that creaked a little , when the weather was dry . There were other scenarios , too , to fit her different moods ; in one , she was held captive by Indians , the mate of a passionate brave called Snow Wolf , who touched her in ways that made her blood heat . Becky did n't look in Emmeline 's direction right away , as she was busy examining her reflection in the ornate full-length mirror next to the door . Becky was tall and voluptuous , with clouds of dark hair , flawless white skin , and amazing green eyes , and even taking her reputation into consideration , half the ranchers and businessmen in Missouri would probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she so much as crooked a finger at them . Apparently satisfied with her appearance , she turned to her niece . " I do n't reckon I need to tell you to stay clear of the downstairs parlor until things quiet down a little . You know how cowboys are when they 've been on the trail awhile . " Emmeline pulled a face . " I know , " she said . She had no desire to " entertain " men , the way her aunt did , but she 'd surely been restless lately . She 'd read every interesting book in the public library , seen every play that came to town , and stitched up enough samplers to carpet the path to perdition . She was tired of marking time , keeping up appearances , and waiting for her life to begin . If something did n't happen , and soon , well , there was no telling what she 'd do . One by one , the other women who lived at the boardinghouse began to straggle in , most of them yawning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmeline with a waggle of their fingers , others smiled sleepily . It was one in the afternoon , by the clock on the mantel  --  the crack of dawn from their point of view . Becky , who never hesitated to take charge , promptly began to give instructions , a general in silk and gauze , and dispatched her troops to their rooms , there to make themselves fetching , before taking up their battle stations in the downstairs parlor . That sumptuous room had always fascinated Emmeline , though she was seldom allowed to set foot inside it . There were paintings of bare-naked women on the walls , Turkish carpets on the floor , and the heavy draperies were fringed in gold . Cigar smoking was permitted , and whiskey was discreetly served , for though Becky had no license to sell spirits , neither did she fear the law . The marshal and his deputies were regular customers , and due to the pitiful salaries they received from the city counsel , they always got a special rate . Today , the pull of that mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her adventurous nature  --  it was this same reckless bent , after all , that had nearly gotten her arrested for swimming naked in the mill pond , one moonlit night , with one or two " wild " girls , and caused her to break an arm climbing a tree on still another occasion  --  but the hours ahead were too long and too dull and , quite simply , she succumbed . Becky had been gone an hour when , moving like a genie summoned from a bottle after a long , long sleep , Emmeline sneaked into her aunt 's sumptuous bed chamber and opened the massive wardrobe across from the fireplace . The interior swelled with clouds of colorful silk , satin , velvet , and lace  --  such a delicious contrast to her practical brown crinoline dress  --  and a wondrous disarray of feathers , bangles , and beads . After due deliberation , she selected a daring red gown of shiny fabric , with an edging of black lace , scrambled out of her own clothes , and put it on . She stood spellbound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straps . Emmeline barely recognized herself . She loosened her nearly blond hair , caught up in a prim coronet at her nape , and pinched her cheeks . Her gray-green eyes , usually calm , sparkled with spirit , and she struck a provocative pose , putting her hands on her hips and jutting out her bosom . She smiled a saucy smile , the way she 'd seen the other girls do , countless times , and whirled around once , admiring herself . She loved the sensation of being someone quite apart from her ordinary self , someone entirely new , someone bold and even a little brazen , and she was reluctant to return to her normal drab personage . What harm could possibly be done , she wondered , if she crept downstairs , just for a very few minutes , and mingled ? The place was already crowded ; the noise from below told her that . If she kept to the far edges of the gathering , she could avoid Becky 's notice and indulge in a little harmless playacting . Flirt with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening , and then slip back upstairs without ever being discovered . The plan nearly unfolded in precisely that fashion . Nearly . Emmeline put a little extra sway in her hips as she descended the stairs , keeping an eye out for her aunt all the while . As she 'd hoped , Becky was busy holding court in a far corner of the room , surrounded by spruced-up wranglers swilling liquor . The other women were equally occupied , chatting , pretending to tell fortunes , serving drinks . Her gaze went unerringly to the biggest , most imposing man in the room . His air of authority immediately marked him as the trail boss , or even the owner of some big ranch down by the Mexican border . He had wavy brown hair and hazel eyes , and he was still wearing his long canvas duster , even though the weather was warm . She glimpsed the handle of a pistol , strapped low on his left hip . He turned to her like a compass needle finding north , and a smile twitched at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trace of mockery in it , as though he suspected she was playing a game , pretending to be someone she was n't . He started toward her , his stride long and slow and graceful . Emmeline , still hovering on the stairs , took an awkward step backward and nearly fell on her bottom . He gripped the newel post in one leather-gloved hand , watching her . He had removed his hat at the door  --  that was a rule of Becky 's  --  and she did n't allow guns , either . Not normally , anyway . Whoever he was , this man lived by a code of his own . " Howdy , " he said . It was enough to mark him as a Texan , the way he said that one , honeyed word , caressing it as it rolled over his tongue . Emmeline concentrated on not swallowing her own . " Hello , " she managed , at last , and felt a hot flush course from her toes to her hairline . She wanted to turn and bolt , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You must be new here , " he drawled . " I do n't remember you from last time . " Emmeline pressed her lips together briefly . " Yes , " she agreed awkwardly . " That 's right . I 'm  --  I 'm new . " He raised one eyebrow slightly . " What 's your name ? " She hesitated , glanced in her aunt 's direction , and saw that Becky was still blessedly occupied and thus had failed to notice her . " Lola , " she said , having read the name in a novel . " Lola McGoneagle . " He smiled again , leaning against the stair rail and watching her . " Well , Miss Lola , " he said , " I 'm mighty glad to make your acquaintance . It 's been a real long trip up from Texas . " Emmeline swallowed so hard that her throat ached . " Oh , " she said stupidly . He grinned . " Buy you a drink ? " Emmeline hesitated , and then decided to live dangerously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in her remembrance book , she thought , and felt a pleasant thrill at the prospect . " Yes , " she said . " I would like a drink . " " What 's your pleasure ? " This time , Emmeline did n't just swallow , she gulped . Good Lord . He wanted to know what kind of liquor she preferred , and she 'd barely tasted the stuff , beyond taking a little brandy in her eggnog last Christmas Eve . " Whatever you 're having , " she said . When he turned away to approach the elegant table that served as a bar , Emmeline told herself to run . To turn right around and head upstairs and lock herself in the other parlor . Instead , she sat down hard on the step , feeling a little dizzy , and clasped her hands together . She 'd just get her breath , that was all , and then she 'd flee . Except that the Texan came back , and seated himself beside her on the step before she worked up enough gumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You been in this business long ? " the stranger asked , handing her a glass with half an inch of straight whiskey in the bottom , glowing amber . Emmeline had never even been kissed , let alone done the things she imagined Becky and the others did with men , but she was embarrassed to say so . Another lie leaped readily to her lips , with an ease that both surprised and shamed her . " Oh , yes , " she said , flipping through the large repertoire of imagined Emmelines she 'd developed over the years . " I came from Chicago , originally . I was on the stage there . " It had always been her dream  --  one of them , anyway  --  to be an actress , a famous and legendary beauty , in fact , with a fortune at her disposal and countless boon companions . She decided that Lola traveled regularly to Europe , and to all the other places Emmeline had read about as well , enjoying the slavish devotion of kings , princes , and potentates . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Emmeline , and she was a little stung . " I see , " he said . " And now you 're  --  doing this . " She bit her lower lip . No , she said inwardly . " Yes , " she said . He pondered that for a while , very somberly , while sipping his whiskey . Emmeline had yet to imbibe ; she held the glass tightly in both hands , willing herself not to spill the stuff on the carpeted stair . " Seems like a hard way to make a living , " he observed , after some time . Emmeline downed the whiskey in a single swig . " Is there an easy way ? " she countered , shuddering as the fiery liquid coursed down her throat and burned in her stomach . She was instantly light-headed and gripped a banister post to steady herself . " I do n't guess there is , " the man said , and smiled slightly , though his eyes were sad . " More whiskey ? " " Do n't mind if I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some mischievous spirit  --  that was the only explanation for her present behavior . If Becky caught her at this game , there would be hell to pay . Still , they talked , Emmeline and the Texan , and drank more whiskey , and the man said his name was Holt , though she could n't recall , afterward , whether that was his first name or his last . He 'd been raised near San Antonio , by an aunt and uncle , and he owned part interest in the herd of cattle Emmeline had seen clogging the street earlier . In time , though how long it was , she could n't have said , he took her hand , helped her to her feet , and led her up the stairs and into the quiet shadows of the corridor . There , he kissed her , and though it was pleasant indeed , Emmeline was mildly disappointed . Her reading , and her fantasies , had led her to expect something more , though she could n't have said precisely what that something was . She sagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , causing him to chuckle . " I thought so , " he said wryly . " Hmm ? " she asked , and burped delicately . Her knees seemed a little weak , and she started to slide down the wall , but he caught her , lifted her easily into his arms . " Your room , " he prompted . " Where is it ? " The vague thrill she felt then was neither alarm nor anticipation , but something different , something she did n't recognize . She rubbed one temple , trying to will her thoughts into some semblance of order . " I think you should put me down , " she said . " I 'm sure this is quite improper . " He chortled at that . " That may be true , " he agreed , " but you 're in no shape to be wandering around a brothel by yourself . " She sighed again . " I live here , " she said . " So you say , " he replied . Emmeline thought fast , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she gestured toward the door of a room she knew was empty  --  only a few days before , Chloe Barker had left Becky 's employ , and Kansas City , for good , taking a train west . Emmeline felt a sharp and sudden stab of envy over that , an uncharitable emotion that she 'd been able to subvert when she was sober . " In there , " she said . If she could just lie down for a few moments , close her eyes , recover her equilibrium , well , she 'd be fine . The Texan opened the door with a motion of his foot . The ghost scents of lavender water and talcum lingered faintly in the still air , dust motes floating like fragments of stars in the pale gaslight pouring in from the hallway . The bedstead was iron , painted white , and the coverlet was cream-colored sateen , threadbare but still pretty . Emmeline yawned widely , and the man called Holt laid her down on the mattress , causing the bedsprings to creak . She tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes , aware that there were other , more important matters of concern as well , but he put a hand to her shoulder and she settled deeper into the pillows . She felt a merciful loosening sensation around her ankles as he undid her laces . That , alas , was the last thing she remembered , for she was caught in a backwash of shadows then , and sent spinning into a place too dark and deep for dreams . When she awakened , the sun was up , and her head ached as though she 'd laid it on the railroad track just before the 10:03 came through . The first thing that came to her awareness was that she was alone in the borrowed bed , wearing nothing but her skimpies . Her eyes went wide as memory returned ; bile surged into the back of her throat . Disjointed recollections traipsed one by one through her mind  --  the red dress , the man from Texas  --  what was his name ?  --  the whiskey . She stumbled to the washstand next to the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porcelain basin , and was violently ill . Then , with frantic motions of her hands , she touched her breasts , her belly , her thighs . She did n't feel different . She was n't sore anywhere , and when she tossed back the bedclothes , holding her breath , there was no blood . Maybe  --  please God  --  nothing had happened . She sat down heavily on the edge of the bed , breathing slowly and deeply , both hands clasped to her stomach , lest it rebel again . And that was when she saw the gold pieces stacked neatly on the bedside table , next to the oil lamp . Emmeline gasped , then fell back on the pillows , yanked the covers up over her head , and wept , for she was surely ruined . How would she ever explain her foolishness to Becky ? Her aunt had spared no effort to make sure Emmeline 's life turned out differently from her own .
