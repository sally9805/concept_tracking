The morning before Dan Rather went on the air with his flammable story , senior staff at CBS 's 60 Minutes gathered to consider whether it was true . Network producers , lawyers and Betsy West , a CBS News senior vice president , among others , met in a screening room to decide whether to broadcast the story about President Bush 's record in the National Guard . Five days before , they had received copies of new and intriguing memos suggesting that Lieut . Bush had ignored a direct order to get a physical and that his superiors were pressured to " sugar coat " his evaluation . No one talked much about whether the documents could have come from a 1970s-era typewriter , and there was no strident dissent . But , says Josh Howard , the show 's executive producer , " We pressed the producer on ' How do you know they 're authentic ? ' " And the producer , a respected veteran named Mary Mapes who had helped break the stunning Abu Ghraib torture story just months before , had answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <P> Much of this evidence would melt away in the days to come . The family and the office typist of Lieut . Colonel Jerry Killian , the alleged author of the memos , as well as additional document experts , would say they did not look real . There would be calls for Rather 's resignation . The Wall Street Journal would declare that the " liberal media establishment " had finally lost its hold on the national agenda . But behind the hysteria , this is a story about human errors whipped into a new-media news cycle . It is also a familiar tale of journalists wanting ever so badly to fit all the disparate fragments of a story into a fine , taut narrative . <P> Rather and other CBS News employees acknowledged for the first time last week that there may be problems with the authenticity of the memos . " It 's up to us to get to the bottom of legitimate questions that have been raised , " CBS News President Andrew Heyward told TIME . Then , in a surprising twist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If the White House had just raised an eyebrow  --  they did n't have to say they were forgeries  --  but if there was any hint that there was a question , that would have sent us back , " says Howard . The morning the show aired , CBS staff members had shown copies of the memos to Dan Bartlett , the White House communications director . In response , according to a transcript of the interview , Bartlett tried to spin parts of the memos in Bush 's favor and attributed the whole debate to partisan sniping . He did not , however , challenge the authenticity of the memos . <P> But the White House did not check the memos for invisible ink either . And why should it have ? After all , the documents were allegedly written some 30 years ago by Bush 's squadron commander in Texas , who has been dead for 20 years . There was no reason the Administration would have known if the documents were real .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
