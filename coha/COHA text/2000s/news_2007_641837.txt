<p> The issue is free speech <p> Re : " Not about free speech , " Sept. 30 Dan Haley column . <p> I think there are two issues here in regards to the four-word editorial in the Rocky Mountain Collegian newspaper : <p> 1 ) The use of the F-word . <p> 2 ) The statement against President Bush . <p> As far as the first is concerned , so what ? The editorial was meant for college kids , and college kids have heard much worse . As far as the second is concerned , if the editorial had instead been written as " F*** MoveOn.org , " then I do n't think people would have been so bent out of shape about it . Yes , this is about free speech , and in more than one way . <p> Leroy Quet , Denver <p> Predicated on a falsehood <p> We Bush supporters believe most of the vitriol toward the president is emotional , not intellectual . J. David McSwane provided us with further evidence to support our claim . <p> Further , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus police for resisting arrest . after resisting being escorted outside . after failing to give other participants a chance to ask Sen. John Kerry a question . He was not tased because of his viewpoint or to restrict his free speech ; it was because he would not yield the floor to other students . President Bush was in no way involved . Therefore , the main implication of the editorial was predicated on falsehood . <p> Jeffery J. Tokarsky , Parker <p> How is this news ? <p> I am amazed at how fixated the Colorado news media are on one four-letter word in the Rocky Mountain Collegian newspaper . When I was in college in the late 1970s , this never would have been a story that anyone would have reported . The Denver Post and other " news " media have wasted so much space and time on this non-story that I have to wonder what stories of actual importance are being deliberately ignored so that you can devote so much energy to something so meaningless . <p> Is this what consumers of infotainment really want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was devoted to Ward Churchill and his distorted statements . <p> John Cleveland , Centennial <p> Butchart was a legend <p> Re : " A man and a Canyon ; ' Grand Obsession ' scales enigmas in the life of the father of canyoneering , " Sept. 30 book review . <p> Thanks to The Post 's Joe Hudson for his outstanding book review about the life of the greatest of all Grand Canyoneers , the late Dr. J. Harvey Butchart , who hiked 12,000 miles below the rim over 50 years . <p> Hudson marvels that Butchart was always ready to help strangers seeking to blaze new backcountry hiking routes through the canyon . <p> Starting in 1977 , after my first Grand Canyon backpacking trip as a seventh-grader living in Wheat Ridge , I wrote Dr. Butchart with a question about one of his hiking books . He promptly and patiently replied in a two-page , single-spaced , typed letter . I bombarded him with so many letters , sometimes weekly , that ( according to a Google search ) our correspondence fills an entire box of the Harvey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take me on an exploring trip . He resisted , explaining that the last time he had done so , his companion had died accidentally while trying to float across the Colorado River on an air matress . <p> Finally , in 1984 , while I was on spring break from Stanford , Harvey relented , and we met on the North Rim west of Toroweap . We spent several trail-less days in the most remote place I have ever been , straining water out of muddy potholes and eating canned sardines by starlight . It was sheer heaven . <p> A photo of Harvey Butchart from that Grand Canyon trek sits on my desk to this day . It reminds me how the patient kindness of a total stranger can transform a teenager 's life . <p> Troy Eid , Denver <p> The writer is the U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado . <p>  --  Hot Topics &gt;&gt; The redesign of The Denver Post Photographs taking the place of actual news <p> I found last Sunday 's Denver Post , with the new design of multiple color pictures very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color capability , I would suggest that that is the least important aspect to providing value in your news coverage . In fact , the amount of space you dedicate to color pictures leaves much less room for actual news stories . <p> I 'm not sure what audience you are targeting with your new emphasis on allocating space to color pictures , but take a look at the first page of each of your sections . It looks like you are trying to compete with lifestyle magazines or with television . I doubt most newspaper readers are looking for that much space dedicated to pictures at the expense of detailed reporting . <p> I 'm hoping this overemphasis on visuals was simply your excitement at this new capability , and that you 'll exert caution in using it too much . <p> Marshall Schecter , Denver <p> Background colors make paper unreadable <p> Congratulations on making The Denver Post the most illegible paper I have ever seen . Your recent format changes are interesting and probably for the better , but the color choices make reading the paper nearly impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidebar to the article on airplane engine emissions is totally unreadable to me . Come on - who thinks that white letters on a pale green background is a good idea ? <p> My comments on readability generally apply to the whole paper - the contrast in the ink , or the density of the ink makes it a strain to read . <p> Progress and change are good things ; making your product more difficult for the consumer to see is not . <p> Frederick D. Bell , Castle Rock <p>  --  Speaking of tongues . Is alarm related to race ? <p> Re : " Speaking of tongues . , " Sept. 30 Perspective articles . <p> I enjoyed your contrasting articles by the honorable former Colorado Gov . Richard D. Lamm and Viva Colorado 's Rowena Alegra about multilingualism in America . Like many of us , I enjoy using modern English , and the richness its many linguistic streams have afforded it in expressing poetry , humor , and the flexibility to adapt to new realities that is vital to any " living " language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of our alarm over both the infusion of Spanish ( or any other non-English tongue ) and of the issue of immigration itself reflects an attitude of cultural and , far too often , racial superiority that has more in common with the " Know-Nothings " of the 19th century than with " tolerance , love and a search for commonalities , " quoting Lamm . <p> Steven Chostler , Denver <p> Enlightening , frightening <p> Richard D. Lamm 's article about an American bilingual society was enlightening and frightening ( " We are one nation , but unity is at risk " ) . His reference concerning multilingual Switzerland was incomplete . Switzerland has four official languages ( French , German , Italian and Romanish ) and the country is essentially divided into four parts , each representing one of the four cultures . <p> I lived in Switzerland for 18 months and traveled throughout . When I was in the German-speaking part where I lived , it was like being in Germany ; when I was in the French-speaking part , it was like being in France ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like being in Italy ; and when I was in the Romanish-speaking part , it was like being in ancient Rome - not really , but it was strange . <p> Is a bilingual society what we want for the United States ? If so , forget about " E Pluribus , Unum . " I vote an emphatic " no " ! <p> Walter R. Payne , Golden <p> Not such an urgent issue <p> While I certainly agree that the United States should adopt English as its official language , I do not agree with Richard D. Lamm regarding the urgency of this action . <p> Language is a very strong tool . A common language can give a group of people a sense of unity that very few other characteristics can . That being said , one must also understand the nature of the Spanish-speaking population in America . <p> The majority of immigrants in our history have come here with the intention of staying here and forming a new life as a citizen of the United States . For a large number of Spanish-speaking immigrants , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They come to America for six or seven months of the year to work and support their families in their own country . After their jobs are complete , they return to their home country until the next year . Also , many immigrants come to America , planning on staying long enough to make money to meet their needs in their country of origin . Many never intend on staying in the U.S. permanently . <p> Why would these people want to take the time to learn English when they only plan on staying in America for a short time ? I do believe that English should be the national language ; however , I do not think it is as pressing an issue as Lamm makes it out to be . <p> Patrick Sutherland , Centennial <p> A danger to U.S. stability <p> I disagree with Rowena Alegra ( " It 's a multilingual world , after all " ) . I think that , unlike German and Italian , Spanish is indeed a threat to English in America . When German and Italian-speaking immigrants came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their transition into an English-speaking culture ; they were forced to learn English and assimilate . <p> However , with bilingual education in schools , and with Spanish being so present in most aspects of society as it works to accommodate Spanish-speaking immigrants , they are not compelled to learn English and assimilate into American culture as were immigrants from previous years . Therein lies the difference between the current wave of immigration and those past . <p> The omnipresence of Spanish is not only threatening English as a language in the U.S. , it stands to threaten the unity and stability of the entire nation . <p> Nathan Smith , Castle Rock
