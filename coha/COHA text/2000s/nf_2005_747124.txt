EXPERIENCES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM , AUSTRALIA , AND NEW ZEALAND <p> OVER the past decade or so , there have been intense public discussions about whether to permit the commercial planting of genetically modified ( GM ) crops in a number of developed and to a lesser extent , developing countries. 1 In the European Union ( EU ) this debate led to a five-year moratorium ( voluntarily agreed to by industry and government ) on the introduction of commercial GM crops from 1999 to 2004 . Even at the end of this period , regulations are extraordinarily tight , and GM companies have yet to fully enter the EU market . In the United States , the largest producer of GM crops , there has been virtually no organized public opposition , <p> This long-running dispute also raises the issue of hoe the scientific community evaluates the safety of GM crops and foods and how various countries decides the extent to which they will invoke the precautionary principle. 2 The procedures through which such decisions are being made invoke a variety of citizen-based deliberative approaches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom , Australia , and New Zealand each conducted suck processes with the ostensive goal of incorporating a wider public appraisal of the scientific evidence . Examining the experiences of these three nations are particularly useful for comparing varying approaches to public deliberation , as they all took a different format . In addition , although the political and cultural circumstances of the three case studies differed , the manner of handling these opportunities were surprisingly similar . <p> The three approaches manifested as a series of public debates and focus group studies in the United Kingdom , known as " GM Nation ? " ; a consensus conference that was undertaken in Australia ; and a specially created Royal Commission in New Zealand . In every instance , the aim was to broaden the public approval basis for a final political decision . In every case , the outcome was for the cautious , closely monitored introduction of selected GM crops , To analyze these approaches , it is useful to first reflect on the perspectives of two commentators with considerable experience on science-policy relationships , both of whom emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding emerging technology with the need for regulatory efficiency and effectiveness . <p> In her work on science politics and regulation , Sheila Jasanoff , Harvard University 's Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies , notes the rise of a " hybrid science " that " combines elements of scientific evidence and reasoning with large doses of social and political judgment . " 3 She echoes the view of Alan Irwin , the University of Liverpool 's Dean of Social and Environmental Studies , 4 that the gap between science policymakers and the larger public is widening . He notes that " we should be cautious in the face of institutional claims to have embraced a new social contract of dialogue , transparency and consultation . " 5 <p> One way forward from these arguments is to seek arrangements for bringing in public opinion to the range of science policy findings and judgments so as to inform policymakers of the broader range of views that ultimately bear on a political decision . There is a large literature on the merits and disadvantages of citizen-based approaches to science and policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main criteria for and against such approaches are summarized in Table 1 on page 25 . GM Crops , Public Opinion , and Science Policy <p> Although intense public discussions have surrounded the issue of GM crops in many countries , they in fact constitute a small percentage of the world 's agricultural acreage . Data from 2002 indicates that GM crops were grown on 59 million hectares globally . Almost all of this ( 99 percent ) was grown in only four countries : the United States ( 66 percent ) , Argentina ( 23 percent ) , Canada ( 6 percent ) , and China ( 4 percent ) . Three crops comprise 95 percent of the land under GM cultivation : soybean ( 62 percent ) , maize ( 21 percent ) , and cotton ( 12 percent ) . Traits achieved by genetic modification primarily involve plant genetics has been commonplace for decades . A second relates to the manner in which decisions are made , apparently favoring multinational businesses with government support and without full public discussion and analysis . A third applies to the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural landscape is inextricably linked to the needs of wildlife and herbicide tolerance ( 75 percent ) and insect pest resistance ( 15 percent ) or a combination of both in the same crop. 6 The shift in European public concern over GM crops began with opposition to the introduction of GM foods into European foodstuffs in 1996-1997 , notably the incorporation of GM soya into many processed foods such as bread , biscuits , and cakes . This led to considerable opposition by environmental and consumer organizations across Europe , most notably in the United Kingdom. 7 Les Levidow , a research fellow in the faculty of technology at Open University in Milton Keynes , provides a valuable background to the EU position in a previous issue of Environment. 8 <p> Setting the Scene <p> At the heart of this concern lie three issues . One is the ethics of deliberately altering genes , even though innovative humans alike  --  and food health scares in Europe in the 1990s , first bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , also known as " mad cow disease , " and later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs. 9 A study of attitudes toward GM crops in the United Kingdom found that about 34 percent of the public was unconvinced by the scientific case for GM crops and claimed that they would never change their minds 10 However , approximately 45 percent of this nationwide sample expressed ambivalence about GM . This suggests that given the appropriate information from a trusted source ( admittedly a demanding requirement ) , a sizeable number of the British public could at least envision the circumstances in which the benefits of GM crops would outweigh the risks . Such a position would , however , depend on an open process of scientific surveillance , an insurance-liability arrangement providing the scope for compensation in the event of any discovered danger , and a tough and open regulatory regime. 11 It might also be largely confined to developing countries , where the case for nutritious and environmentally robust GM crops seems more appealing . <p> The Science Assessment <p> Underpinning all these findings is the nature of the science case for GM crops and the manner in which science policy is determined via a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment ( see Table 1 above ) . <p> On 21 July 2003 , a panel of scientists from a wide body of disciplines and backgrounds published a very detailed review , the GM Science Review : First Report , for the U.K. government . After reviewing evidence on allergenicity , the review panel stated that " there is no evidence that currently commercialized GM crop varieties or foods made from them , are toxic , allergenic or nutritionally deleterious .... The principal arguments for this are that molecular tests done on products prior to commercialisation have been conducted , and that the combination of testing by developers to satisfy regulatory requirements for clearance , extensive use around the world over long time periods with large exposed populations , and the absence of evidence of harm , does provide important experience of safety . " 12 <p> Furthermore , the authors commented , " on balance , we conclude that the risks to human health are very low for GM crops currently on the market . But GM does present certain particular potential challenges in risk management and the situation may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the crops developed . It suggests there is a need , therefore , to continue to develop safety assessment technologies , effective surveillance , monitoring and labelling systems , and to have in place effective avoidance strategies . " 13 <p> Nonetheless , the review authors did conclude that given the predicted increase in the number of plants and new traits coming to market , complexity and uncertainty over the environmental and public health aspects of this changing technology will increase : For example , they noted , " we do not know whether fitness-affecting traits like altered growth rate , longevity , plant size , or survivorship in plant species with potentially more invasive life histories ( e.g. woody plants , perennial grasses , thicket-forming herbs ) will result in invasive and problematic plants as is true of such non-GM plant introductions as Japanese knotweed and rhododendron. " 14 <p> Five years prior to this review , a series of farm scale trials were begun on actual fields . From 1998 to 2003 , the trials , which were administered by an independent scientific team , overseen by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assessed the impact of herbicide-tolerant GM crops on local biodiversity . This was an important aspect of the science-policy analysis . The scientific policy advisors as well as the politicians looked for evidence-based outcomes to justify any final political decision . So these multimillion-pound ( sterling ) experiments were a vital part of the political analysis , even though their evidence was not explicitly addressed in the public debate . <p> The results indicated that two of the three crops ( fodder beet and rapeseed ) have the potential to negatively impact weed populations and hence the wildlife that depends on weeds for food . As a result of the interpretation of this evidence by the official GM crop regulatory body , the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment , the U.K. government announced that it would allow commercialization of maize under strict licensing conditions . Subsequently , industry found these conditions too onerous and decided not to proceed with commercial planting for the time being . <p> The current regulatory environment is not conducive for plant biotechnology companies in the European Union . The EU has set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a product but is seeking 0.5 percent where it is possible to detect such low concentrations . Moreover , tracing GM concentrations through supply chains is far from simple and may necessitate parallel transport networks . Although it is still under debate who will bear the primary responsibility for tracing such concentrations  --  there may be an element of shared responsibility with government agencies  --  it is likely companies and producers will shoulder much of it . <p> The dominant approach is for each relevant national regulatory body to assess each crop on a case-by-case basis , the result of which is then considered by all other member states as well as the regulatory institutions of the EU . This creates a relatively long approval/rejection process , with substantial delays almost inevitable , and thus can prove costly to industry . Certain member states have used the process to halt approvals . Adding to all this , the rules for liability have not been decided yet given the difficulties in reaching consensus in relation to who would pay for adventitious presence in a neighboring crop . <p> GM Crops for Developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developed world , but issues facing the developing world are much more pressing . In many countries in southern Africa , rates of malnourishment affect more than 50 percent of the population. 15 <p> The Nuffield ( U.K. ) Council on Bioethics report , written in 1999 and reiterated in 2003 , suggests that GM crops have " considerable potential to improve food security and the effectiveness of the agricultural sector in the developing countries . " 16 The Nuffield team also concluded that deployment of the precautionary principle , which demands absence of risk as a basis for proceeding , is impracticable and potentially limits the ability of farmers in the developing world to use beneficial GM crops. 17 Instead , it recommended a comparison of the risks of the status quo set against possible GM introductions , coupled with an extensive farm-based , field-centered research program . It also argued for strong but limited liability regimes for the biotechnology companies concerned . In an article in the January/February 2000 issue of Environment , Wellesley College political scientist Robert Paarlberg remonstrated rich-country activists for denying access to modern biotechnology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science Review ( which formed a parallel strand with the GM Nation ? discussions ) and the Nuffield Council report have widespread implications for the analysis of the deliberative procedures that follow . The science perspective carries biological , agronomic , social , and ethical components . The conclusions are cautious , reflect uncertainties , and press for sensible , open , precautionary measures . This all resonates with recorded public opinion , namely that the risks and benefits of this technology are not settled and that tough regulation and constant surveillance will always be necessary . The question that remained was how to bring the conclusions of this cautious but expansive science assessment into the political realm as well as to the wider public . Among the three countries discussed below , the United Kingdom devised the largest and most comprehensive deliberative process to address this question . To describe this process it is important to place the U.K. regulatory scheme in proper context . Regulation and Debate about GM in the United Kingdom <p> No GM crops are currently licensed to be grown commercially in the United Kingdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU member nation Spain . The GM foods and animal feeds that are approved for consumption in the EU are connected to processed products from GM herbicide-tolerant soybean and maize and oil from GM rapeseed . Tomato paste made from slow-ripening GM tomatoes is approved but is not currently available , although it was widely sold in the United Kingdom in the late 1990s . The regulatory process in the United Kingdom is dynamic , continuous ( in that no approval is absolute ; it is always under review to take account of advances in science and technology and prevailing knowledge ) , subject to critical challenge , and continuously geared toward improvement . Applications to cultivate GM crops  --  or to place foods or animal feed derived from them onto the market  --  are reviewed by scientists serving on advisory committees . In the United Kingdom , these are the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment , the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes , and the Advisory Committee on Animal Feeding stuffs. 19 <p> A number of events during the 1990s created pressure for a reform of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United Kingdom ; these are summarized in the box on page 27 . <p> The main innovation was the establishment of the Agriculture and the Environment Biotechnology Commission ( AEBC ) in 2000 . This body was designed to be inclusive and deliberative and to guide the government on its policy position . Its membership embraced academics , biotechnology business representatives , nongovernmental groups , and those interested in ethics and public policy . <p> The first major research output of the AEBC was an examination of the 19982003 field trials , in particular the role of the trials " in the regulatory process , looking at the reasons for setting them up , their objectives ... the data they were expected to produce and the gaps which might still remain and , in particular , to try to understand and explain the evident public concern . " 20 One of the conclusions of the report on the field trials , Crops on Trial , was that the trial results alone would be an insufficient basis on which to make a decision on commercialization . One of the subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercialization of GM crops . This was accepted by the U.K. government , and the Public Debate Steering Board was convened to organize and promote the debate . Figure 1 on page 28 outlines all the elements of the subsequent debate , which was called " GM Nation ? " <p> The steering board was composed of AEBC members as well as people with a variety of perspectives and linkages to GM crops . This hybrid composition made the task of reaching collective agreements fraught with difficulties . The tensions associated with keeping the steering board together were enormous. 21 <p> For the various tiers of the public debate , the only scientific information available to participants on the day of the discussion sessions was the so-called " stimulus material " in the form of a booklet developed by the steering board in collaboration with the Science Museum and the U.K. government 's Central Office of Information ( COI Communications ) . 22 The material was presented in the format of a question followed by a " for " and " against " position with no weight given to the arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valid . The box on page 29 presents a sample question/statement , followed by two replies . <p> The replies were written by members of the steering board themselves and were subject to some negotiation . At an early stage of the drafting , the anti-GM members tried to include allegations that GM caused severe illnesses . These texts were quickly rebuffed by industry representatives . This situation arose given the coexistence of opposing perspectives on the steering board ( essentially those supportive and those critical of the technology ) . Consequently , no consensus could be reached on existing evidence or even what should constitute evidence . This was further complicated as no knowledgeable mediator existed to adjudicate the competing claims . The contractors , COI Communications , were not experienced enough to accomplish the task . <p> The organization of the deliberative events meant that the stimulus material was rarely used in the tier one , tier two , or tier three events ( see Figure 1 for details of these events ) ; it was prepared far too late to be sent to participants prior to the meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were small groups of people discussing the issues and then feeding back to the whole event ( tier one events ) or a panel of speakers who gave brief presentations followed by a question-and-answer session ( tiers two and three ) . There was little chance to engage with the science as contained in the stimulus material at these events . <p> This suggests that the British debate was an ambivalent and inexperienced entry into a deliberative process that suffered from many understandable difficulties . To begin , public opinion was by no means neutral . Proponents and opponents were always advancing their cause . Second , the process itself was not logically or procedurally consistent ; there was neither the money nor the organizational follow-through to make it so . Third , the scientific aspects of the GM debate were constantly marginalized . Fourth , the real scope for engaging with the middle ground of relatively open-minded public opinion was lost in poorly managed public meetings and a relatively unstructured follow-through for selected citizens devoid of clearly weighted , accessible information . <p> In terms of the evaluative criteria raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent undirected procedures for post-debate learning did not provide for a process of mutual understanding or open-minded appreciation of the science-technology case . Despite a sincere attempt to include a range of social values , the polarized nature of most of the open public debates prevented the systematic social sharing of different perspectives . The main public meetings were dominated by voices who were opposed to the technology . This is to be expected as the meetings were self selecting and hence likely to attract green activists . The overall effort did stimulate public debate , however , with approximately 40,000 people involved in one way or another . While the debate did not offer any prolonged encouragement for participatory science-policy assessment , it did commit the U.K. government to a more explicit set of procedures for involving a range of public opinion over novel technology and science themes , from genetics to nanotechnology . <p> On the debit side , the U.K. experience was prolonged , costly , and cantankerous . It did not touch the broad mass of the public . It suffered from agenda manipulation and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It informed policies , but it did not guide them . The Australian Consensus Conference <p> Much like the experience in the United Kingdom , Australia 's system for regulating GMOs underwent a transition from voluntary to legislative in the late 1990s to early 2000s , partly in response to the growing controversy surrounding genetically modified crops at the time . In spite Of this controversy , which was noticeably less fervent in Australia than in Europe , the commercial production of GM crops began . No fewer than eight GM crops ( varieties of cotton and carnations ) have been commercialized in Australia since the first insect-resistant cotton ( INGARDr ) was approved in 1996. 23 Since then , research into GM crops by private and government biotechnology organizations in Australia has continued apace . Some of the many applications being explored by Australian scientists are currently undergoing laboratory and field trials ( see Table 2 on page 31 ) , but most are not yet in general commercial use . Herbicide-resistant soybeans , while used in Australia , are not grown there . However , the Office of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commercial planting of GM oilseeds such as canola ( rapeseed ) . 24 <p> A Topical Issue <p> Although Australia 's biotechnology industry is comparatively small by international standards , in 1998 the country was ranked among the top five agricultural biotechnology producers. 25 Accordingly , public-policy development for biotechnology industry development at the national and state level began to accelerate in the late 1990s. 26 Applications for field trial release of GMOs submitted to the ( then ) national regulatory body ( the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee ) increased by 29 percent  --  to 45 applications-in the year 1998-1999 . Cotton was the major crop targeted for release , with only half as many applications submitted for canola . The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) , Australia 's largest and most prestigious public sector research and development body , was listed as the most active organization carrying out GMO field trials. 27 <p> Increased social awareness of the issue of gene technology in Australia was promulgated by frequent reports filtering in from the United States and Europe throughout 1998 and 1999 . Epithets such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently emblazoned across Australian television screens and newspapers . Emerging public debate focused on the issues of food safety and labeling , echoing trends in Europe. 28 <p> Media exposure of genetically modified foods over the first six months of 1999 confirms that there was a strong undercurrent of concern surrounding the issue of safety . A market research study conducted by MediaScape Analytical &; Research Services ( based near Sydney ) indicated that media coverage of biotechnology in July 1999 was double that in February , with negative coverage rising 14.4 percent during the same period. 29 However , positive coverage also increased by 50 percent . During this period , genetically modified organisms rated as the top issue , increasing from 33.9 percent in February to 70.38 percent in July . Safety in food , therefore , rated as extremely topical . <p> All these issues became part of Australian political discourse . A unique feature of the Australian political system is the considerable importance it affords minority parties . Prior to the federal election in 1998 , the Australian Green Party held the balance of power in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of significant environmental issues . From their position of influence , the Greens were able to regularly focus on gene technology and insert the concerns that went with it into public discourse. 30 <p> Given the rapid advance of gene technology into the economic and social aspects of people 's lives and the concern expressed by the Australian community about possible adverse side effects  --  especially in the food chain  --  it was considered vital that widespread public consultation and informed public debate about the technology be undertaken as soon as possible , incorporating mechanisms for ongoing communication . A suitable approach identified by the Australian Consumers ' Association was the consensus conference , a method of participatory technology assessment developed by the Danish Board of Technology in 1987 . <p> The Consensus Conference Model <p> Consensus conferences arose from international attempts to find a better way to recognize the respective roles of science and value judgments and to give deference to the rights of the citizen to participate in the development of public policy on complex and challenging issues . A consensus conference is organized as a public meeting between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with the assessment of a socially controversial technological issue. 31 Following extensive discussions over ( usually ) two preparatory weekends , the lay panel puts its questions and concerns to a panel of experts , assesses the experts ' responses , and then deliberates to construct a consensus statement , a report that expresses the members ' expectations , concerns , and recommendations . As ordinary citizens construct the recommendations , no one particular interest is represented . Likewise , the lay panel 's report has no one particular target but hopes to inform parliamentarians , scientists , public policymakers , interest and consumer groups , media representatives , and the general public . Such a conference has two overall aims : to encourage ongoing public debate on new technologies by providing accessible avenues for that debate and to contribute to formal policymaking processes by providing recommendations from a social , ethical , and economic perspective 32 . <p> In Denmark , consensus conferences have played an extended role in government policymaking , not just for science and technology but also for a range of controversial issues. 33 Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensively across Europe , and more recently it has been subjected to field trials in New Zealand , the United States , Japan , South Korea , and Canada . More than 30 consensus conferences on technological issues had been conducted around the world by the time it was first used in Australia 34 . <p> Overview of the Australian Consensus Conference <p> In early March 1999 , 14 Australian citizens , randomly selected from responses to unspecified advertisements in suburban and regional newspapers , gathered at Old Parliament House in Canberra to debate with experts on the highly controversial issue of gene technology in the food chain . The occasion was the first Australian consensus conference . Over three days , the lay panel , comprising people with no prior knowledge of the topic and representing a range of attitudes and values , addressed questions to a panel of experts who represented ( respectively ) science , industry , the environment , religion , and public health . The general objective of the conference was to bridge the gap between citizens and the previously exclusive combination of experts and decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create greater awareness , more informed discussion , and wider debate on gene technology among the Australian public . <p> The Lay Panel 's Recommendations <p> The lay panel 's extensive deliberations carried its aspirations into political and wider public domains . The preamble to the report of the Australian lay panel proclaimed : " We may well be laying the foundations for a change in political process that can deliver the public an opportunity to contribute to the formation of the laws they are governed by , and in so doing , partake in the shaping of their own destiny . " 35 Overall , the Australian lay panel adopted a " precautionary approach " to gene technology in the food chain. 36 While it recommended a halt to all new commercial releases or unlabeled importation of GM foods , it fell short of recommending a moratorium on current applications and field trials . <p> The panel recommended the establishment of a new statutory authority , with wide representation and transparent and accountable decision making processes , to conduct comprehensive risk assessments of new proposals and to oversee the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or type of modification . In addition , the panel expressed a preference for a coordinated approach to gene technology regulation among the states and territories , while moving the responsibility away from the agriculture portfolio . An independent assessment to determine the viability and impacts of alternatives to GM agricultural products was also recommended . The implementation of a decisionmaking model such as the consensus conference to bring together representatives from industry , government , consumers , experts , and lay citizens was proposed as an alternative to the current framing of legislation in an adversarial context . Furthermore , the panel promoted the provision of better public access to gene technology information through the establishment of a gene technology information office that provided toll-free information services , information fact sheets , Web sites , and other public education methods . <p> Assessing the Impacts <p> Taking into consideration its inaugural status , the extent to which the first Australian consensus conference was likely to have an impact needs to be measured against realistic expectations . <p> Key policy advisers were represented among the expert speakers , as were key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consumers ' Association . Given the predominance of regulatory issues in the cross-questioning of the expert panel , it would have been beneficial for the lay panel 's deliberations to include among these experts appropriate regulatory representatives from either the Australia New Zealand Food Authority or Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee . However , this was overlooked first by the steering committee and later by the lay panel . Policy actors without any links to the steering committee or the expert panel were not kept informed throughout the process , although many were invited by the steering committee to attend the consensus conference and were later sent copies of the lay panel 's report . Indeed , the audience consisted mostly of industry and stakeholder representatives , as well as some political staffers . No express commitment was given by any of the participants to take into account the results of the consensus conference , although some participants undertook this task independently . <p> Because of the absence of any formal links with policy actors , the poor articulation of the Australian consensus conference findings to the political arena resulted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consequently , on policy . By contrast , in Denmark , where there are long-established links between consensus conferences and political institutions , parliamentarians have been found to have a " broad awareness of , and interest in , consensus conferences " with the majority able to identify the model 's aims. 37 <p> Policy Impact of the Consensus Conference <p> For some time before the Australian consensus conference took place , the government had been developing a national biotechnology strategy to oversee the regulation of genetically modified organisms , details of which correspond to a number of the lay panel 's recommendations . In fact , a new regulatory system was provided for in the National Biotechnology Strategy announced by the Commonwealth Government in May 1999 , just two months after the consensus conference . An amount of A$10 million was allocated to Biotechnology Australia within the Department of Industry , Science and Resources ( DISR ) to " develop a national strategy for biotechnology ; a public awareness program to provide information about biotechnology and gene technology ; training in the effective management of intellectual property ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 38 A further A$7.5 million was allocated for the establishment of a statutory Office of the Gene Technology Regulator ( OGTR ) in the Health and Aged Care portfolio , " operating under regulatory powers conferred through an inter-governmental agreement and associated Commonwealth , State and Territory legislation . " 39 <p> A key measure of the success of the first Australian consensus conference set by the organizers themselves was the staging of a second Australian conference . Although the government had agreed ( in a major amendment to the Gene Technology Bill 2000 ) to hold a consensus conference on a gene technology issue within 12 months of establishing OGTR in June 2001 , and development funds purported to be worth A$50,000 were allocated to Biotechnology Australia for this purpose , to date , no announcements have been made by OGTR or Biotechnology Australia to honor this commitment. 40 <p> The absence of any mention of the proposed consensus conference in quarterly reports of the Gene Technology Regulator suggests the government does not intend to proceed further along a deliberative course . However , it can be assumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee and Gene Technology Community Consultative Group is seen by OGTR to partially fulfill the intended role of the proposed consensus conference . A submission by the Interim Office of the Gene Technology Regulator to an inquiry into the Gene Technology Bill 2000 41 suggested that the subsequent establishment of the Gene Technology Community Consultative Group reflected the view of the Australian lay panel that " government decisions would be better informed through the establishment of a mechanism similar to the consensus conference model bringing together perspectives from industry , stakeholder , and citizen groups . An inclusive dialogue encompassing different interests would , in the view of the panel , lead to better regulatory decisions . " 42 However , the committee included only 2 lay representatives among a membership of 11 . In addition , it is anticipated that some of the ethical and moral issues to be addressed by the Gene Technology Ethics Committee will also correspond with those identified in the report of the consensus conference. 43 <p> Set in the context of the evaluative criteria in Table 1 , the Australian consensus conference was a relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a political and regulatory outcome that maintained a science policy-public interface , and it generated a wide array of opinion . Critically , however , it did not design itself to incorporate the necessary dialogue that Jasanoff and Irwin , among others , advocate . Major interested parties played only a tangential role , and the longer-term ethical-economic implications of the technology were not given a sufficiently full airing . The degree of direct engagement with the policy processes around ministers and parliamentary opinion was insufficient and a source of much frustration for the organizers and particularly the lay panel itself . The Case of New Zealand <p> New Zealand , also known by its Maori name Aotearoa , has also engaged in public debate about GM. 44 Like the U.K. and Australian cases , the outcome was also compromised by the structure of the debate , albeit more subtly restrictive . In this case , the government recommended cautious acceptance of GM in a political climate broadly hostile of the technology and illustrated a dominant policy approach that presumes that science can answer questions of ethics and culture. 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increasing desire of New Zealand policymakers for incorporating other " ways of knowing " such as indigenous/holistic perspectives is at the root of the GM conflict in New Zealand . <p> The Royal Commission on Genetic Modification <p> As in Australia , the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand held the balance of power and enlarged the public discourse on GM . New Zealand has a Mixed Member Proportional electoral system , so although the Labour and Alliance parties formed a coalition government , they did not have a majority of parliamentary seats . The small Green Party gained a very powerful position by agreeing not to unseat this coalition government if a vote of no confidence in the government were cast . In the aftermath of extensive public protest against GM , an inquiry into GM was the Greens ' main 1999 general election campaign issue . Shortly after the election , a Royal Commission on Genetic Modification ( RCGM ) was announced . Although this inquiry could be seen as having arisen due to public pressure , it did not act as a conduit for public opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maori , and special interest groups . While a vocal minority representing the biotechnology industry pushed for relaxing existing regulations on GM and promoted the benefits of a GM future for New Zealand , 9,998 ( 92 percent ) of the 10,861 public submissions were either strongly against or tended to be against GM. 46 In addition , the overwhelming majority of submissions made by Maori at hui ( meetings ) voiced concerns about GM , and environmental and other social movement groups argued against the adoption of genetic modification. 47 <p> The evidence from these special interest groups ( referred to as Interested Persons ( IPs ) ) normally provides the core material of Royal Commission investigations . Gaining IP status was a fiercely contested process that involved groups applying to the commission and then defending why they should be considered for this special status . However , it was important to gain this status , as it was the only way a group could present oral evidence to the commission and defend their evidence under cross-examination . IP status was also necessary to be eligible to cross-examine others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written submissions to the commission . <p> All IPs were required to present their arguments within a 16-question template in which all answers had to " stand alone , " meaning they could not be cross-referenced . This approach accommodated the segmentation of many scientific responses . Biotechnology proponents reported experiencing no difficulty with the template . <p> In contrast , the environmental groups voiced major concerns about the format . Although environmental groups often rely on science to convey their concerns , they frequently have misgivings about a concentration on science . Relying on scientific arguments to fight an environmental battle often means a lack of attention is paid to the extent to which social and cultural values are part of the debate , shifting public attention away from the human-related activities that embody most environmental crises. 48 The environmental groups thus wanted to provide holistic submissions that explained the interconnectedness of issues rather than answering separate questions . Therefore , the reductionist parts approach disadvantaged opposition to GM while advantaging scientific input and support for GM. 49 <p> Vocal opposition to GM continued up to the time RCGM was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  from a total population of just four million  --  marched down the main street of Auckland , the financial capital , to remind the government of the public disquiet over the wider implications of any commercial planting . RCGM 's findings can be summarized as " proceed with GM with care . " 50 The recommendations included recommencing GM field trials and planning for traceable releases of genetically modified organisms . <p> Post RCGM <p> The public-science-policy nexus surrounding GM in New Zealand can be seen as one in which the government attempted to include public participation but struggled to handle the worldviews that it encountered in doing this . As a result , public opinion is still sought and a scientific policy approach is still used to move ahead with GM despite the continuing opposition from the public who feel unheard . <p> Since RCGM 's findings were released , the government has continued to move ahead with GM . But despite the government 's new efforts to " solve " the GM issue , public pressure has not dissipated . <p> It could be suggested that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the creation of Toi te Taiao , the Bioethics Council. 51 The council 's roles are to provide advice to government when issues involve significant cultural , ethical , and spiritual dimensions ; promote and participate in public dialogue and enable public participation in the council 's activities ; and provide information on the cultural ethical and spiritual dimensions of biotechnologies. 52 <p> The council advises the government ; however , decisions on releasing GM remain with the Environmental Risk Management Authority ( ERMA ) and its scientific risk-based approach . ERMA has recently been given the ability to approve traceable releases of GMOs , although no releases have yet taken place. 53 Shortly after the government lifted the moratorium on GMO field releases on 29 October 2003 , ERMA approved the field testing of GM onions. 54 <p> As public participation is not seen as having the ability to influence policy due to the reliance on the science-based approaches , nonviolent action against GM continues in New Zealand . Since RCGM released its findings , numerous forms of protests have occurred , from the uprooting of a GM potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research 's laboratory at Lincoln University , Christchurch , to a 2004-2005 GM-free picnic series in the Rotorua Redwoods Forests , sponsored by the activist group GE-free Rotorua 55 At the same time , actions continue to encourage councils to go GM-free and the government to reintroduce a moratorium . The public hostility to GM is evident , and one of the most striking examples is a pledge taken by 3,500 ordinary citizens to take direct action  --  that is , to destroy or pull up any GM crops planted in New Zealand  --  should GMO releases go ahead. 56 Observations on the Experiences of Science-Policy Procedures <p> A spectrum of approaches to the public science-policy nexus is provided by these experiences in the United Kingdom , Australia , and New Zealand . Although all three cases demonstrated the governments ' willingness to engage with the public , the ability of people to do so within the ambit of deliberative public debate varied depending upon the structures of the processes selected . Yet all three showed an inability to weigh explicit social value judgments with the broad science consensus . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above that none of these experiments contributed to a serious process of mutual social learning . In the United Kingdom , the failure of the evidence base and the handing of the public debate to local arrangements and interested parties meant that there was systematic bias against the GM position and much difficulty for pro-GM perspectives to obtain a coherent airing . In New Zealand , the Royal Commission continued the tradition of formal public participation , making inclusive debate difficult . In Australia , there was a much more ordered process , but the model was experimental , and the appropriate range of opinion that would have encouraged mutual learning was absent . <p> Inclusion of Social Values <p> At one end of the continuum is the New Zealand experience , in which nonscientific arguments about GM were implicitly marginalized . The template for interest groups made it difficult to use holistic arguments . As a result , scientific responses were advantaged . At the other end of the continuum is the U.K. experience , which attempted to try something innovative , not privileging scientific arguments over other , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken without context and authorship , and thus key aspects on which to judge the merits of the arguments  --  which frequently includes asking , " Is this peer-reviewed science ? " - were not possible . Somewhere between these two approaches is the Australian consensus conference experience . The consensus conference forum was created in a conscious attempt to recognize the role of science and of explicit value judgment and to involve citizens in policy decisionmaking . It moved away from the conventional inquiry approach with its emphasis on expertise and so-called fact-finding yet at the same time also retained some shape , not just for open discussions but for policy recommendations as well  --  an aspect largely missing in the nationwide attempt at debate in the U.K. GM Nation ? discussions . <p> Social-Political Awareness Building <p> The link to political procedures and to a wider array of public opinion was weak in all three case studies . The timing of the United Kingdom 's science review and . public debate made a flow from science to the public to policy impossible : The science review overlapped with GM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public debate . Furthermore , the U.K. government appeared to have already decided their response to the commercialization of GM based on the field trial evidence . In Australia , the consensus conference had no formal links to government policymaking , and the recommendations came too late to inform policy even if they could be said to have strengthened the Australian government 's commitments . Finally , in New Zealand , the wider but more diffusive public submissions against GM were dismissed , because the debate was not described as a referendum . Moreover , there was a bias in favor of scientific submissions  --  although the government did utilize a number of RCGM 's recommendations . <p> Stimulation of a Public Debate <p> In all three processes , there was a media profile of sorts as well as a political profile that was generated by the debate and the controversy . This was not explicitly incorporated into the findings of any of the arrangements examined here , but it did result in a degree of openness to conflicting views , and it did activate the protagonists and antagonists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying issues raised by analysts such as Jasanoff and Irwin have not gone away . Australia had planned to incorporate some sort of consensus conference approach to science-policy decisionmaking regarding gene technology . However , this did not eventuate . <p> In New Zealand , the public-academic business interface has been activated by a number of new initiatives . One such project was Constructive Conversations/ Korero Whakaaetanga , funded by the New Zealand Foundation for Research , Science and Technology and based at the Social Science Research Centre at the University of Canterbury. 57 Another project was the " Hands Across the Waters " study by Karen Cronin and Laurie Jackson at Victoria University , which received funding from the Ministry of Research on Science and Technology ( MoRST ) . Constructive Conversations/Korero Whakaaetanga explores social , cultural , ethical , and spiritual implications of new health biotechnologies such as genetic testing . " Hands Across the Waters " engaged various stakeholders in debate about GM in 2003 to advance understanding of the key issues in the debate and identify ways to improve communication on science and technology issues in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake a larger extension study , which takes the findings back to participants and the wider science community . <p> In the United Kingdom , the debate over GM has moved into the realm of sustainable agriculture more generally . Presently , the government is undertaking a review of possible additional procedures for joint regulatory surveillance of biotechnology in the framework of sustainable agriculture and environmental safeguards . A deliberative approach to the analysis of another potentially controversial technology ( nanotechnology ) has embraced a wide array of interested parties and will soon surface as a public deliberative procedure. 58 <p> Disadvantages <p> The two primary disadvantages of all three of these procedures were that they were more time consuming and more costly than anticipated and , in the end , that they neither closed the public dispute nor improved the relatively low rating in the credibility and integrity of the final political decisions . This unsatisfactory outcome was a function of innovative procedures that were not fully thought through along the guidelines outlined in Table 1 . Inevitably , they were more expensive and took more time than politicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political process that fostered all three of these deliberative procedures never properly engaged in their design , procedures , or outcomes . In all three cases there was a strong sense among participants that the outcome would provide a backdrop for other political considerations that were not part of the debate . <p> This is understandable , because in a representative democracy , deliberative procedures are not designed to rule . Nevertheless , the tone and seeming lack of sensitivity of politicians to these procedures did not encourage any sense of serious and responsive learning . Ironically , this political tendency to place such procedures as background advice has resulted in even more clamor for more effective deliberative and participatory procedures . This occurred for precisely the reasons that Jasanoff and Irwin outlined : In essence , the deliberative processes failed to link regulatory concerns with the values of a sizeable number of citizens in all three countries . <p> Despite  --  or perhaps because of  --  the dismal results of the U.K. , Australian , and New Zealand experiences , there is still a strong case for more ambitious experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political culture of the nation and to the modalities of political procedures . They require careful attention to design , monitoring , evaluation , and built-in learning . They also need to be tuned to the point on the emergence-decision cycle for science and technological innovation . Early phases , where the ideas and information are still relatively ill formed , and where public opinion is not well grounded , would benefit from more exploratory procedures . Where a technology is mature , as in GM crops , and where public opinion is more fixed ( and possibly polarized and ambivalent ) , more sensitive and science-connected measures need to be given more attention in the design and in the balance of argument offered to participants . These measures would generate most openly and more interactively the merits and demerits of moving the scientific interpretations forward . Furthermore , they would help to clarify what regulatory liability measures need to be incorporated . There is always a case for careful precaution backed by continued scientific assessment and constant surveillance . And , in the final resort , the link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer more influence in guiding such deliberative procedures than has been demonstrated so far . Table 1 . Advantages and disadvantages of public-science-policy deliberative procedures Advantages <p> Participant learning . Deliberative processes provide opportunities for participant learning about others ' points of view and about the value of the process per se , not only for the lay panel but for the organizers and experts as well . <p> <p> Inclusion of social values . Deliberative procedures should ideally involve many different people from different professional and social backgrounds , thus enabling the inclusion of a diversity of values and beliefs . <p> <p> Social/political awareness building . Depending on their timing and topicality , deliberative procedures may contribute to heightened public awareness and attract political attention . <p> <p> Stimulation of public debate . Deliberative procedures can stimulate public debate where no organized debate may occur . <p> <p> Raising sensitivity for participatory technology assessment ( pTA ) methods . Public support gained by meaningful inclusion in science and technology decisionmaking processes is fundamental to the continued growth of technology research and to the public 's acceptance of the products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The value that can be placed on the opinions of a small group of lay citizens is often questioned . <p> <p> Cost . Deliberative procedures are often seen as an expensive way to inform an insignificantly tiny proportion of the population to enable them to deliberate better . <p> <p> Indirect relationship with decisionmaking processes . The lack of an established institutional base and access to parliamentary decisionmaking processes can pose an impediment to a model 's contribution to policymaking . <p> <p> Agenda setting by coordinators and/or sponsors . Consensus conferences may be readily manipulated to enhance the public relations agenda of the organizers or sponsors , and any perceived manipulation naturally undermines public trust in the process . <p> <p> Nebulous conclusions . The conclusions reached by some deliberative procedures are often nebulous because they have been organized around a topic or issue that lacks focus . <p> NOTE : The criteria for and against citizen-based approaches in this table are not designed as a formal evaluative framework ; rather , they are regarded as typical representations of case study findings . So the qualities that encourage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparative assessment . <p> SOURCE : A. Mohr , " A New Policy-Making Instrument ?
