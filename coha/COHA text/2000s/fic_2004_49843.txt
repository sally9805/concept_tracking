IT WAS ABOUT THREE IN THE MORNING the Friday we started two-a-days when Cindy got up out of a dead sleep and came into my TV room and caught me lolled back on the couch watching The Gardens of Gomorrah II with my dick in my hand . That 's the one with Vanessa Viper in it . She 's the big-time colored porn star , black as Lawrence Taylor , who would n't be near man enough for her . Even in his prime . When Cindy stepped into the room , this Vanessa Viper was sandwiched in between a white man and a Mexican . The white man was some kind of German I think on account of him having nothing on but a pair of jackboots . The Mexican was younger and in way better shape and had ROBERTO DURAN and a pair of boxing gloves tattooed on his ass so he was on top , taking the back road . I 'd never seen nothing like it . I was so deep in it I did n't even know Cindy was there till she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you , Raymond ? " <p> Now , this was my private room , where I kept my trophies and such and broke down game videos . It had the big TV and the VCR , that couch , a ragged old recliner , a coffee table , a little cock-high refrigerator I kept my beer in , and shelves and shelves of game videos . Cindy had no interest in any of that . Far as I knew she 'd never set foot in the room since we got moved in good some fifteen years ago . I thought we had a agreement about it . I thought this was a place I could come back to and settle in and be myself . I thought that was one of the things that kept our marriage going . But it did n't matter what I thought because there Cindy was and there was Vanessa Viper , taking on two foreigners that did n't have nothing in common except they was both hung like gas pumps , and there I was , wearing nothing but my socks , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed a couch pillow and held it over my parts with my left hand . My right hand scrambled around for the remote . But it 'd slipped down someplace I could n't get to and Vanessa Viper just went on and on . " I 'm sorry , Cindy . God knows I am . Duane give me this after work . I did n't even know what it was till I stuck it in . I swear . " <p> She did n't say nothing so I just kept fumbling till I found the remote and pulled it up out of the cracks of the couch and clicked the TV off . Then , all hangdog and ruined , I looked up at Cindy . <p> She walked over to me and took the remote out of my hand . Then she took a seat in the recliner and aimed the remote at the TV . <p> " Cindy , " I said . " Do n't do this . It 's like Satan hisself had ahold of me . Then you come in and saved me from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . " <p> But there was n't any reasoning with her . She pressed PLAY and there was Vanessa Viper again , nowhere near satisfied . I do n't think she ever did get satisfied , but we watched until she 'd drained those two boys of all the sap they had . Must 've took a good fifteen minutes of filth and Cindy just sat there , the remote in her hand the whole time , without saying a word . <p> When it was over , Cindy threw me a look that would 've put the fear of God in Vanessa Viper herself . " That 's all I needed to know , " she said . She stood up , walked over to the couch , and handed me the remote . " Have a nice life , " she said . Then , just like that , she left me there all by myself . <p> I just laid there awhile , wallowing in shame and trying to think . Neither of them did me any good so I got up and went to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent the next fifteen or twenty minutes begging and pleading . I told her that this little lapse she 'd caught me in was the first of its kind and that it came about because of me not being able to sleep . Worry about the upcoming season-not having but four full-time starters coming back-kept me from sleeping and when I woke up tonight in the middle of the night I just happened to remember the video Coach Hattabaugh-that 's Duane , he 's my defensive coordinator-loaned me so I plugged it in . After a while , I got to thinking , well , this ca n't hurt anything and it might even help me sleep and before I knew it I was in the shape she 'd caught me in . " It was way wrong , what I did , " I said . " No doubt about it . I 'll need praying over . But it wo n't happen again . I promise . Next time I 'll just take a pill and put myself out . " <p> I stopped there and listened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Here we go , I thought . I 'll roll out the tears for her , then give her some of that good slow loving she claims she likes and that 'll pretty much be that . <p> She opened the door . I gave her a sorrowful , broken-faced look . She said , " It does n't matter , Raymond . Not to me . I 've been seeing Yancey Tune . It 's been going on nearly two years now . I was planning to leave you at the end of the season anyway . " <p> I stared at her for I do n't know how long . Then I broke into a grin . I could n't help it . I mean , Yancey Tune ? He was an old white-headed black man that had started coaching not long after Martin Luther King got killed . Hell , I played against teams that bleak-eyed bastard coached twenty-five years ago-and he 'd already been at it a good while . He coached anyplace else , he 'd been fired years ago , but no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such , and that 's where the university is too . Educated people . Nobody there much cares whether they win or lose . So they always lose . But they feel good about their-selves because they got a colored coach . I 'd been a head coach eighteen years , played Lafayette ever year , and I 'd lost to them one time . After that game , I set my boys down in the locker room , gave them a good cussing , let them know there would n't be no postgame AQ chicken that night , and told them I never thought I 'd live to see the day a team of mine lost to a bunch of faggots and professors ' sons . <p> Now , I do n't have a racist bone in me . Most years , half my team 's various shades of black . Last year or so , we 've even had a few Mexicans join in . Still , Yancey Tune was what he was and besides , like I said , he was old and could n't coach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out and put my hand on her arm and was about to tell her I appreciated the joke , but she said , " Take your hand off me , Raymond . " <p> I did what she said . I mean , you could 've froze gasoline with her voice . " When you wake up in the morning , Raymond , " she said , " I want you to pack up what you think you 'll need for the day . I 'll be gone Saturday and Sunday . That 'll give you time to get the rest of your stuff out . " <p> " Yancey Fucking Tune ? " was all I said . <p> But she shut the door in my face . <p> Yancey Tune ? My mind could n't take it in . I moped about the house for something like an hour trying to get it to but then gave up and went back to my couch . Then I went back to the bedroom door and kicked it a time or two and called her a niggerlover and suchlike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told myself that if Cindy was the kind of woman that was drawn to a man like Yancey Tune I was well shut of her . <p> Next morning after practice , I told Duane I needed to have a little talk with him . We walked through the fieldhouse and into my office . I sat in the chair in front of my desk and motioned toward the couch . He sat down . I looked at him . He looked at me . I had my hands folded together in front of me . My thumbs were worming their way around each other . " Something wrong , Coach ? " he said . <p> " I do n't even know how to get started , " I said . " But whatever I end up saying , I 'd like you to keep it to yourself . " I gave him a look that carried a question with it . He gave me a nod . " It 's me and Cindy , " I said . I noticed my thumbs had commenced worming again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner at my traveling bag . he looked at me . I made my thumbs stop . " Her and Yancey Tune , then , " he said . " I 'm real sorry . " <p> I sat back . " Christ , " I said . " How 'd you know that ? " <p> " Secondary coach up there , Jack Alpey , teammate of mine in college , he told me . That was back during the spring . What he told me , it 's pretty much common knowledge up in Lafayette . " <p> " Cindy and Yancey , you mean ? " <p> " It 's been weighing on me ever since I heard . Could n't bring myself to tell you . " He shook his head . " I can vouch for Jack , though . He 's straight up . " <p> I thought about it all for a minute . " Yancey Tune , " I said . <p> We just sat there a minute . Then he said , " I 'd 've never thought it of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " It 's got me where I do n't even know what I want . One minute I want her back . Next , I want to kill her . " <p> He mulled this over . " Well , " he said . " Maybe I ought n't say so , Coach , but , it was me , I 'd be telling myself I been married to the same woman twenty-some-odd years . She bore me no kids . I do n't have that to worry about . And now she 's cut me free of her . So I got nothing tying me down at all . Hallelujah 's what I 'd be saying . " <p> " But Yancey Tune ? " I shook my head . " I do n't know how I can live with the shame of it . " <p> " Aw , Coach , " he said . " You just got to get you another woman . Younger , better looking . Man like you , still in his prime , you just getting started good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Maybe . What I had in mind now , though , was going up to Lafayette and beating the hell out of Yancey Tune . " <p> He gave me a look like he was having to size me up all over again . " Beating up an old black man for stealing your wife ? Both of you head coaches ? Be all over the papers . Talk about shame . Nobody 'd ever remember anything else about you . " <p> I gave that a thought . " It 's what worries me , all right , " I said . <p> But Duane did n't even seem to hear me . He had that far-off look in his eyes like the one he got when he 'd just been struck by an idea for a new blitz package . Then the sharpness come back in his eyes and he said , " He 's got a daughter , you know , Yancey does . About your age . " <p> " I never heard nothing about that . " <p> " Well , what Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about shame , she run off to California when she was sixteen or seventeen and just went wild out there trying to get in the movies and ended up hooked on drugs and being a whore . " <p> I could n't see what he was getting at . " What good 's that do me ? " I said . " I ca n't be driving out to California in the middle of the season . " <p> " Rumor is , she 's home , Jack says . Yancey brought her back to put her in rehab . Instead she went right to work at the Booty Call . " <p> " I 'll be damned , " I said . " That place ? Jesus . " The state coaches association convention had been in Lafayette a couple of springs ago . Both evenings we were there , I 'd gone along with some of the other boys to the Booty Call . It was a downright den of iniquity . <p> " I tell you what , " he said . " I 'll get on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find out . " <p> " No need for that , Coach . I was just needing to talk some . I appreciate your help . " <p> " Do n't mention it , " he said . " Like to think you 'd do the same for me . " <p> That evening , after we 'd run the team through a practice that had me feeling better about things in general , Duane was in my office again . According to what he 'd been told , Yancey Tune 's daughter was back in Lafayette and dancing at the Booty Call . <p> " Works under the name of Vanessa . Jack said he had n't checked her out hisself . Worried she might tell Yancey on him just for spite . But he said some of the other coaches go there regular and always end up emptying their wallets buying private dances off her . Said she was wild as batshit , was n't nothing she would n't do . " <p> " And Yancey Tune knows all about this ? " <p> " Jack says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just seems to brood a lot . " He shook his head once , then gave me a grin . " Her real name 's Tamara Tune , Jack said , and you can look it up in the phone book . And you wo n't believe this , Coach , but what Jack said was she could be a twin of that woman that was in that video I loaned you . Vanessa Viper . " He gave me a nod and a grin . " I reckon it 's why she uses the name , " he said . <p> The truth is I did n't have the least notion of going to the Booty Call then-or even of driving to Lafayette at all . I figured I 'd give myself a workout on the heavy weights , shower up , then go out , get me a bag of burgers at the White Spot , and come back and watch the Braves on TV . <p> And that 's what I did . But that shithook Trachsel was pitching for the Mets . You can lose your hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't gone by with him jerking and scratching and shaking off signs and starting it all over again before I got to thinking about Vanessa Viper . But damned if I had n't left The Gardens of Gomorrah at the house , and then , before I knew it , Cindy took over my mind and I decided to drive home and have another talk with her . <p> I got there and the house was dark except for that one light in the den she always turns on when we 're gone at night . I rang the bell a half-dozen times , then banged on the door a while . Not a sound . We 'd never even had a dog , me and Cindy ; she could n't have kids , did n't like dogs . It would 've been nice , I was thinking , even a dog ; it would 've been something . I took out my key , opened the place up , and stepped inside . Everything went all black and lonely on me and I just stood there a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood rising up , but then , there in the quiet dark , it went down again and I decided I 'd just write her a note , nice like , telling her what she was doing was wrong and she ought to think about it long and hard before throwing the life we had together away like it was some kind of old cheerleading outfit she could n't squeeze into no more . But when I got to the kitchen table , where we always left our notes to one another , there was already one there . It was laying under The Gardens of Gomorrah . It said , " Thought you might be needing this . " And that was it . She had n't even signed her name . <p> Well , naturally , I started to break the place up then . I turned the table over before it came to me I had a reputation to uphold . I stood there another minute or so , regretting that , and then I saw that if I went on with this I 'd be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd use it against me . So I set the table back up and put the chairs where they ought to be and then I picked up her note and the video and put them back where they 'd been . I decided the thing to do was to just go on ahead and write her a note back . I got a sheet of paper and a pen from over by the phone where she kept them . " You 're wrong , " I wrote . " I do n't need this at all . I got no use for it . I 'm just taking it back because Duane says it 's overdue and he 's having to pay the fine . I come here to talk to you and tell you I 'm sorry for anything I done and it 's wrong what you 're doing which is throwing over all the years of our life together for a old black man like Yancey Tune that has not won anything in twenty-five years and has a whore for a daughter too . I love you still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Probably I ought not to have wrote that part about his daughter , but there was n't any way of stopping me . And anyway it was something Cindy ought to know , even if it was me that had to tell her . <p> I left then , locked the door behind me , and before I even knew what I was doing I was in my Ram on 540 heading north toward Lafayette . I had no plan and was in no mood to work on one . It just felt good to be moving through the night . So I lolled back and rode on . It would n't be bad , I was thinking , to keep going , right on into another life . I got the Ram , a camper over the bed . Banks open in the morning , I can pull into a branch of mine , take everything I got in it out , and then be off again and shut of my troubles . I buzzed the window down and let the wind whip around the cab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for the first time in years I was tempted to stop and get me some smokes . But then I realized I 'd need a six-pack to keep them company and remembered it was dry all the way from here to Lafayette . In these hills , it 's easier to buy meth than beer . And pretty soon I was thinking that if it really was old times Cindy 'd be sitting between me and the beer , her tits rubbing against my ribs , my hand between her hot little thighs , and she 'd be lighting my smokes for me and cracking me open a cold Bud whenever I needed one . So when I got to the first Lafayette exit , I took it . <p> Now , I did n't have the least idea where Yancey Tune 's house was . Somewhere there in town , I figured , but I was n't even sure about that . I was sitting at the stoplight on Sixteenth Street trying to come up with a game plan when some bastard in a red rice-burner starts honking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and jerk him out of his car and stick his nuts in his tailpipe . I just turned left instead , figuring I 'd stop at the Huddle Club , which I knew where it was , and have me a beer and ask directions . Before I got there , though , I saw the Sands Motel , where they used to put us up at tournament time here back when I played American Legion baseball . I had good memories of it so I pulled in . <p> Turned out the night man was some kind of towelhead . He was wearing regular clothes , nothing at all actually on his head , but the way I looked at it that just meant he 'd lost his religion and that made him even worse than he would be if he still had it . There was n't nothing holding him back now . Still I was in there so I went right on with it . It was n't till I was about to ask for the phone book that he looked up from whatever screed he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me one of those big oily grins they give you that make you feel like you spilled something on yourself-or like they 've spilled something on both of you , more like . I looked down at myself and saw I was still wearing the T-shirt and a pair of those coaching shorts with all the game-plan pockets I put on when I got out of the shower . I had n't paid any mind at all to what I looked like . I still had my flip-flops on . <p> The night man nodded . " You are the man looking for a woman , " he said . <p> Let me tell you that took me some aback . " No , " I told him after a blink or two . " I was just hoping to borrow your phone book . " <p> " Where is need for this ? " he said . " This woman very young . Only eighteen year . " He gave me a wink there to let me know he was kidding , but I could n't tell whether that meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to argue myself out of snapping him up over the counter and beating some morals into him . That 's why I did n't say nothing right off . He showed me that smile again . " A color girl . You like this very much . You go to room sixty-nine , you see . " For a beat or two , it looked like he was going to let the smile die off but he was just giving it an oil change and it came right back as a smirk . " Is good , you think , this number ? " <p> Well , way I see it , enough 's enough . " Listen up , Punjab , " I told him . " I did n't come up to be led into the wallow by some sand-dune pimp . " That 's how you have to handle them . He was standing at attention now , no smirk , no smile , and when I told him to get me the phone book like I told him in the first place , he set it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . <p> There were a half-dozen Tunes in the book , Yancey being the last of the lot , right after Tamara . I did n't think nothing about her then , just noticed the name . Yancey had him a place on Sequoyah Drive . I knew where that was , up on the hill overlooking the town . I notched the number , 210 , in my mind , closed the book , and looked up at the hot-sheet terrorist , who was nodding at me , all solemn and parsonlike . I wonder when it was that people first took the notion that just anybody could come over here and set theirselves up as an American . <p> Sequoyah Drive just makes a circle . It goes around some kind of Methodist hideout-a scatter of brick buildings of various shapes and sizes , some tennis courts , and what looks to be a half-assed setup for a brush-arbor revival . People 's houses are on the other side of the road from that . And right at the place where you can best look down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blue neon . Some people had parked there , a couple in a green rice-burner and somebody I could n't see in a blue Ford pickup . I was moving slow , looking for 210 , but it was dark and you could n't make out the house numbers . The third time I came to the cross , I pulled over and got out . I figured I might as well ask directions so I walked to the pickup but there was nobody in it so I went on to the rice-burner . Walking up to it , I did n't see nobody in it either . When I got close enough so I could look in the passenger window , though , there they were . They had the passenger seat cocked all the way back . There was a girl-a little firecracker blonde-there with nothing on except the skirt she had wadded up around her waist . She was sitting astraddle some dark-skinned boy-Mexican , I 'd say-that had her tit in his mouth . His jeans were down around his boots and he was having his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice me . The boy 's the one that saw me first . He opened his eyes and there I was , standing outside the car , waiting for directions . I could see him saying something and then the blonde looked up and screamed . <p> I just turned and walked away , figuring a good scare like that might teach them a lesson . Then I heard some thrashing about in bushes down below the cross and when I looked I saw some big old mullet-headed boy scrambling up the hill . He stopped and started yelling at me , calling me a pervert and such like . I waited him out . When he 'd spent hisself , I said , " My name 's Coach Yancey Tune , head coach of the Lafayette Bulldogs , and I got a house just a notch or two down this road . I 'm sick of the likes of you coming up here and leaving your slime all over the side of this hill . Cops 're on their way . I called ' em . " I gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Junior , have at it . I 'm done , the cops wo n't need to do nothing but shovel you up . " <p> He stood there for several beats , but I could see the sap seeping out of him . Then , like some kind of spring snapped to inside of him , he jerked around and , slap , he was in the brush again , yelling , " Come on , Melissa . Move your ass . Let 's go . " <p> Just then , the Mexican started up his rice-burner . He backed up , revved his motor , which was missing some , and peeled off into the night . Then the mullet and Melissa-who , no matter what her name was , turned out to be a sleek little Asian piece that could 've done way better than him-come up out of the brush and , without doing no more than scowling at me , got in their truck and took off too . <p> Still , I figured they might come back , so just to be safe , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the hill looking for number 210 . <p> It turned out I was right by accident , Yancey Tune did live just a couple of houses down from the cross . It 's a little frame house with a screened-in porch and it 's set a little further back off the road than any of the others . I did n't see any lights on in it so I followed the driveway around to the back of the house , thinking I might find Cindy 's Taurus parked there . But there was a garage there and it was locked so I went back around to the front . The screen door was n't hooked and I opened it and went in and crossed the porch and knocked on the main door . Nothing . So I did it again . And then again . Louder each time . I knew they were there . Where else would they be this time of evening ? <p> I was right . A light came on and then another and I could hear the wife-stealing son of a bitch walking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's the police , " I told him . " There 's been some trouble over by the cross . Just wanted to ask you a question or two . " <p> A bolt slid , a lock turned , the door opened . <p> You should 've seen Yancey Tune . He was wearing your grandpa 's nightshirt and a pair of rest-home houseshoes . Little springs of his white hair were sticking up in all directions . His eyes were all washed-out and runny-looking . I could see them trying to make me out through his glasses . When people talk about being scared of the black man , they 're not talking about Yancey Tune . In Cindy 's case , I figured adultery must be its own punishment . <p> " Coach House , " he said . He reached up and with his middle finger slid his glasses up his long nose and then looked down it at me . " Imagine meeting you here . " <p> " Do n't need no imagination for this , " I told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Claim ? " he said . <p> " We got married in the sight of God . It 's my job as the wronged man to lead her back into it . " <p> He tilted his head off to one side . " Now and again , " he said , " God seems to shift his gaze . You ever notice that , Coach House ? " <p> " No , " I said . " That 's just the kind of thinking that loses big games . " <p> He nodded . " Entirely possible , that , " he said . " Winners never quit , do they ? " <p> The way he talked caused an itching under my skin , but I decided to give him one more chance . " Why do n't you trot your old black ass back there and bring her to me ? " I said . " You do n't , I 'll have to do it for you . " <p> He gave me a look like he did n't understand any of that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't trot anymore . " <p> So I drew back to give him a good straight right . Before I knew it , though , I was curled up on the porch floor , my nose broke and gushing blood all over my face . I still do n't know what he had in his hand . Goddamn him . <p> I was gathering myself for a comeback when I looked up and there was Cindy , standing over me and enjoying the view . " Thank you , Raymond , " she said . " This is the way I 'd like to remember you . " <p> " You 're living in sin , " I told her . <p> I scrambled to my feet fixing to charge one or the other of them but that brought on a fresh gush of blood that stopped me long enough for Cindy to say , " I 've called the police , Raymond . I know it 's not my place to be telling you what to do , but it might be wise to think about leaving . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house together like some kind of dance team leaving the stage and before I could do anything I heard the lock click back and the bolt snap to . A beat or two later , the lights went out again . I banged on the door and yelled at them some . I made it clear to the both of them that I knew all about Tamara Tune and the line of work she was in and that if they did n't come to their senses I might just have to make use of it . But they did n't seem to care about that one way or another . They just held their peace and after a while you could tell it was a waste of time . I stepped back and tried to reason it through . <p> It was n't plumb dark where I was but it was close to it . So I left the porch and went out into the yard and looked up at the sky . It was clear , not the least streak of cloud , a purple sky with stars flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and you think you could sing a song about it or paint a picture . But not then . All of it seemed to be ganging up together and poking fun at me . <p> So I went back up on the porch and kicked the window out . It was that cheap glass they used in houses back before anybody worried much about keeping the cold out and it went just like that . Just to be safe , I took the time to clear away some of the jagged pieces still clinging to the frame before I stepped on through . I do n't know why but the first thing I did when I got in was unlock , unbolt , and open the door . I guess I was making a point . Anyway , it was a mistake because when I turned Cindy was holding a gun on me . A .45 , it looked like , though I was n't seeing real clear right then . <p> " Raymond , " she said , " I think you 'd better stay right where you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know whether I 'd enjoy killing you , but a big part of me wants to find out . " <p> Yancey Tune tried to reason with her . " Cindy , " he said . " Please . He 's just a fool . Do n't do this . " He opened his hand and asked her to give him the gun . She did n't even look at him . " No , " she said . " This is between me and Raymond . " <p> I stepped forward , thinking to try my hand at talking her down , but she slanted the gun over just so and blew a hole in the door . I do n't remember thinking anything just then . I missed out on all the wars we 've had , after all , so it was the first time anybody 'd ever shot at me dead on . But when I think back on it now I can hear that bullet making a singing sound going by my ear . I do n't know , that might all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , is turning around and looking at what she 'd done to the door . She did n't miss me much , I can tell you that . <p> Silence took us then , me and her and Yancey Tune , and everything all around us too . You could feel it weighing on you . It seemed like that was all there was in the world . None of us had ever been there before , I do n't think . I know I had n't and I 'm pretty sure about Cindy . And I do n't think Yancey Tune had either even though it was his house . We just stood there waiting for the next thing to happen . <p> What that next thing was was the cops pulling up in front of the house . I turned and watched them get out of the car . They looked like the usual pair , full of theirselves and dumb as dirt daubers . I turned back to Cindy . " I guess you win , " I told her . Then I gave Yancey Tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out the door . <p> I was going up to the cops , easy like , planning to turn myself over , when my wits come back to me . Soon as I got up to the first cop , I said , " It 's under control now . They got him inside . Thanks for coming . " <p> " It 's our job , " he said . I stepped aside and he walked past me . The second cop came up . " You all right ? " <p> I told him yeah but they could probably use his help inside . I let him get all the way to the porch before I took off for the truck , walking at a good clip , but not running so as not to draw undue attention to myself . About halfway up to the cross , I heard Cindy yell . Then the first cop let out a holler and I threw a look back over my shoulder and saw the second cop , who must 've played some ball in his time , running up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the weight room handy , I kept myself in good shape so I did n't have any trouble beating him to my truck . It was n't till I reached out to open the door , though , that I remembered I 'd locked it . I got my key out and stuck it in the lock and had the door open and one foot inside when the cop said , " That 'll be far enough , Coach House . " <p> I turned around . He had his right hand on the butt of his pistol , which was still holstered . Maybe he would n't ever have drawn it , but I was n't taking any chances . I 'd had enough gunplay for one night . So I drew back and hit him so hard he bounced when he hit the asphalt . I hopped in the truck then , started it up , backed it out , and aimed it home . The cop was up by then and standing just a few feet in front of me . I pulled down into low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my way . About the time I rounded the curve , I heard a gunshot . Could 've been just a warning , fired into the air , I do n't know . It did n't matter to me , one way or the other . <p> I was almost down to level ground before I heard the siren . At College I turned south and not long after that they squelched the siren and then I was out of town , headed home on old 71 . It was about Greenland before I got to thinking again . Johnny Law had called me by name and , anyway , Cindy and Yancey Tune would tell them who I was and where I lived and anything else they wanted to know . There would n't be nothing waiting for me at home but more cops , blue misery . Sure , all the Blue Mountain cops belonged to the Quarterback Club but all that would do was make things worse . I did n't want to have to live with the shame of being a head coach that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the West Fork EZ Mart . <p> I sat there in the cab of my truck trying to come up with a game plan , but the harder I tried the less good it did . All I could think was that I was n't nothing but a broken man brooding in a truck . I do n't like the feeling of feeling sorry for yourself . All my life I 've steeled myself against it . So I decided to do something . I decided to start getting even . I decided to go to the Booty Call . <p> I needed to clean up some first so I went inside to the John and stood before the mirror and gave myself a study . Blood had caked around my nose , which had a little lump on it about halfway up . A lot more blood had dried on my shirt , which I guess I 'd used to wipe my face with at some point or other . I started to throw a punch at the wall just to buck myself up again . When I balled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across my hand . That 's when I noticed that the punch I 'd hit the cop with had busted my knuckles some . I guess it would 've started hurting me before if I had n't had my mind on other things . You might 've thought that would 've just drug me even further down , but it did n't . It helped me remember that there 's always something even a cornered man can do . <p> So I went back out into the store and had a look around . Sure enough they had a rack of T-shirts for sale . I 'd 've liked to bought myself one that did n't have any messages or brand names on it so as not to look an outright fool . But they did n't have any like that . The best I could do in extra-large was one that had a flag on it and said UNITED WE STAND . The woman there , a hard fifty at the least , looked like she might 've been out on some kind of night pass . Still I set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such . But she never so much as batted an eye . Just rung up the bill and took the money . Some kind of customer they must get there . Paying up , though , I noticed I was running a little short of cash . So I went to the ATM box they had over by the ice-cream freezer and stuck in my card and took out five hundred dollars , which was all it would give me just then . The till-box woman did notice that . <p> " Big night , I reckon , " she said . <p> " Just stretching tonight , " I told her . " Come morning , I 'm going all out . " <p> " I 'll put up a notice , " she said . <p> I let that pass , went back into the John , washed up good , put on my new shirt , and gave myself another looking over . There was still some dribbles and blotches of blood on my shorts but nothing really that would make you think twice about yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The woman working the till at the Booty Call looked like she might 've been a sister to the one at the EZ Mart , except that she was some older and carried about twenty more pounds of fat . " Good to see you back , Coach , " she said . <p> She must 've been the same woman that had been there during the coaches convention . But that had been two years ago last spring and I could n't recollect doing nothing to cause me to stick in her mind like that . Still , I held my tongue , just gave her a twenty for the six-dollar cover and watched close while she counted out the fourteen ones she gave me back . I put them in one of my game-plan pockets . <p> " Vanessa working tonight ? " I asked her . <p> " Never misses a night . " She looked down at the clipboard she had in front of her . " She 'll be the fourth one up . " <p> The way the law works in Lafayette is if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working there can get plumb naked . The Booty Call did n't sell liquor . All they had was a Coke machine at the door . So when I got in where I could see good , I did n't just see a naked woman all spread out on the stage , I see four more working the tables too . None of them was black . <p> There was maybe fifteen men there that night . They looked like they 'd come right from work and stayed on . The Booty Call did n't draw the big crowds of college boys and businessmen you get at the other Lafayette strip clubs , where they sell drinks and the women tend to be younger and better-looking and on special nights you might get to see a porn star . But it was safer here , I figured , because the cops kept a close eye on the other places , busting them now and again for the least little flash of gash . <p> Me , I preferred the Booty Call . One thing , none of the girls here had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them here , they were young and small and firm . Others had been hanging longer and had gone a little slack . I liked that . Variety . The important thing , though , was here they 'd give you way more than a flash . They 'd lay down on their back and shake it right in your face or get on their knees and reach back between their legs and let you take in the full panorama . They 'd even slip a finger or two in it once in a while . You put a dollar in your mouth , they 'd take it between their tits and then step down off the stage , straddle you , and rub theirselves all over you . <p> I did n't want to be tempted and lose my head before the time come so I bought me a Diet Dr. Pepper and watched from one of the back tables while the next three girls-Chiquita , Paris , and Envy-took their turns . Chiquita was a short-legged Mexican with a little pot belly and a baby face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blonde that did a lot of jumping and jerking and slid up and down the pole several times . Envy was a brunette , up in years for this line of work . Her tits hung nearly to her navel , but now and again she 'd cup one or the other of them , bring it up , and give it a kiss . She danced real slow to a pair of Garth Brooks songs I recognized right off . <p> Then they announced Vanessa and I got me a chair right up by the stage . She was as black as a Congo midnight and looked a lot like Serena Williams might if she was darkened up and seasoned some . She was n't wearing nothing but a pair of shiny , thigh-high red boots and a red , white , and blue string bikini when she got up on stage and she had the bikini off before the first song got started good . The music being played was n't no more than an excuse for her doing what she was doing but she made good use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stint to keep her close . Twice during each of her songs , she stepped down and got all over me , backwards and forwards . After she finished up her turn on stage and made the rounds collecting tips , she came back and sat in my lap . She 'd been carrying the two pieces of that string bikini around in her hand so she was still naked except for the boots . <p> " How you doing , Lucky ? " she asked . <p> A lean , long-legged redhead named Summer was doing the splits on stage and I was eyeing her over Vanessa 's shoulder and thinking maybe I had enough money for the both of them until Vanessa dragged a tit across my face . That reminded me I had a job to do there and brought all my attention back where it belonged . <p> " Not lucky yet , " I said . " But I do seem to be headed that way . " <p> " Oh , you gon ' get there , darling , " she said . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit and I seen you down here in that shirt and you 're laying out them dollars for me , I says to myself , ' Vanessa , girl , there 's your lucky man . You and him , you the Yankee Doodle pair . ' " <p> I reckon she could feel Old Blue rising because she straddled me , arranging herself so that there was nothing between him and what he wanted but a little strip of coaching shorts . " Ooh , " she said . " I like that . It 's all I can do to keep from coming right here . " Then she threw her head back and went into a full-body shiver . <p> She got up then and bent over in front of me so that her parts were right in my face . Then she reached between her legs and spread herself wide open . " What you say , Lucky ? " she said . " It pink on the inside like the big boys always told you ? " <p> I told her it was . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened it even more . It was pink with little chocolate-colored speckles around the edges and then it was pure pink as far as you could see , which was some distance . <p> I thought I heard her say something but could n't make out what it was . " I 'm sorry ? " I said . <p> " Money , " she said . " Slip it in the slot , Lucky . Help me keep that repo man away . " <p> So I did . I rolled up a one and put it where she wanted it . <p> Without taking it out , she turned around and straddled my lap again . " Ai n't this nice , " she said . " Money in my pussy , Sugar Daddy 's dick all swole up hard against it . Vanessa 's done died and gone to heaven . " <p> When she finished with that , she leaned forward and squeezed my face between her tits . Which were real nice . She stayed like that a minute , all limp and spent like ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , " It 's time you let me give you a private dance , ai n't it , Lucky ? We done all we can do out here . " <p> The Booty Call charges you thirty dollars for a private dance-and that just buys you one song 's worth of woman . But I had a wallet full of tomcat dollars so I gave the woman at the counter a hundred , told her I 'd be buying at least two dances , maybe more . She just nodded and gave me four tens back . <p> The redhead 's second song had ended , and a woman named Jasmine that looked like she might 've floated over from Egypt or some such place had taken the stage . Her first song was just starting up and we had to wait that out before going back to the private dance part . Vanessa had me sit on the stool they had there at the door . Then she sat on my lap . She still had the two pieces of that string bikini in her hand . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can tell , " she told me . She leaned back some and gave me a looking over . Then she reached up under my new T-shirt and felt my abs . I 'm right proud of them . " All that hard muscle , " she said , " that busted nose . You some kind of man . " <p> " I got to set an example , " I said . " I 'm a coach . " Her mentioning my nose had caused it to start hurting some again . But I did n't let on . " You like coaches ? " <p> " I got a special feeling for them . My daddy 's a coach . " She cupped her left tit and brought it right up to my face . " He do n't much like me , " she said . " But all the other coaches do . " <p> I licked out at the tit , but she moved it back . " Careful now , " she said with a teasing grin . " You gon ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face toward it and she kept moving it away and laughing and I could 've gone on with it some but just then the Egyptian 's first song ended and Vanessa stood up . " It 's time , Coach , " she said . I followed her back , keeping a couple of steps behind so I could watch the way she walked on them boots . <p> The setup back there looked like what you might find in a Mexican whorehouse except the rooms were n't as big and did n't have beds in them . There was six or eight of them-rooms , I mean . Each one was about the size of a big closet and did n't have nothing in it but a metal straight chair and what looked like a nightstand . An ashtray and a little lamp sat on that . The rooms had curtains you could draw to after you got inside , but they were made out of some kind of flimsy stuff you could see right through . There was n't but one other pair at work . A little blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on some man 's lap . I did n't pay much mind to him right off , but when I saw his face it took me some aback . He was old , real old . He had his head throwed back and his face twisted up and he looked a lot like my daddy did right before the cancer took him out . I had n't seen either one of them out on the floor so I figured he must 've been back here with her the whole time . Figure the price of that . Maybe his plan was to keep her there till he either got his nut off or died . Whichever way it worked out , I thought , the little blonde had hit the jackpot . As for the old man , he never seemed to notice me . I threw him a nod anyway . Way I see it , there 's worse ways of being old . <p> Vanessa took the room two doors down from theirs . I sat in the chair . She straddled my lap and moved around me slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You ever had you a homecoming queen before , Coach ? " <p> " No , " I told her . " Just the maid of honor . " Which was all Cindy ever was . <p> " I told you , " she said , " you lucky tonight . " And the next song started up . <p> She took my new T-shirt off over my head and the things she done to me and let me watch her do to herself after that , I ca n't tell you . It 'd take too long and I 'd go too far . All she did n't let me do was take my shorts down and set Old Blue free . Anything you can do without doing that , we did . When the first song was over and I 'd caught my breath , I told her I 'd like to give her a call sometime and take her out . I 'd treat her right , I said , I 'd come into a small fortune . <p> She got down on her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stared up at me with them nasty eyes . " I 'm in the book , " she said . " Vanessa Penny . I ai n't there , leave a number . " <p> I gave her a look . I wanted to be sure . " Penny ? " I said . " I thought you was Yancey Tune 's daughter . " <p> " You did , did you ? " She gave Old Blue a nibble through the shorts . Then she wrapped her hand around him and gave me a grin . " Got to protect the family name , " she said . <p> " Good thinking , " I said . <p> She leaned back a little and tugged my zipper down an inch or two . Then she looked up at me and licked her lips . " The more you tip , " she said , " the luckier you get . " <p> So I stood up , got my wallet out , and opened it up , making sure she got a good look at the hundreds so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four tens on the table . By then , the next song had started up and Vanessa had the zipper all the way down . " Ooh , look what we got here . Little Louie , all growed up and gone bad . " <p> Just then something about the song caught me . It was Elvis , and I could n't believe it , but it was true , it was " In the Ghetto . " Vanessa nudged me back into the chair , undid the button at the waist of the shorts so she could get at me good and took Old Blue in her mouth . All of him . Lord God , she was a woman that knew what she was doing . I put my hand on the back of her head , but gentle like , you know , just to help her along . She tilted her head so as to give me a good look at her work . Now and again she cut her eyes up at me . Duane was wrong about that . There was n't nothing cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Let 's fuck . I 'll give you another hundred and it wo n't take but a minute . " <p> She took Old Blue out of her mouth and gave me a wink . " A hundred and fifty , " she said . <p> " Done . " <p> " And thirty more for the next song too . " <p> " Done . " <p> " This song ends , " she said , " I 'll get a condom . " <p> She kept on earning her money for the rest of that song , and it was all I could do to hold off till the next one . I closed my eyes and turned my mind to Yancey Tune . What you think about me now , Coach ? I thought . And , you watch , I 'm just getting started good with your slut of a daughter . <p> " In the Ghetto " started winding down . I 'm going to make it to the next song , I thought . That 'll do for tonight . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Call Vanessa up , start taking her out , let Yancey Tune see us together . Cindy too . It made me grin just to think about it . <p> Then I opened my eyes and saw them same two cops standing in the doorway . <p> Blue Mountain fired me from my coaching job , of course . I guess you ca n't blame them , what with all the bad publicity I brought down on them . They had a TV crew set up outside the Booty Call . I was all over every channel the next day . Did n't have nothing on but my shorts and my flip-flops and a pair of handcuffs . They would n't let me put my T-shirt back on . United We Stand , my ass . They did n't even bother with Vanessa , just told her to be on her way . She took my wallet with her . <p> They kept me in jail all that night and most of the next day . Of all people , Yancey Tune came down the next evening and bailed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in good , so I told him about me and Vanessa . He told me he did n't even have a daughter and that the woman in the phone book was no kin to him at all . He said he had a son , though , that taught physics out in Colorado Springs at the Air Force Academy . " Vanessa , " he said . " I do n't know how that rumor got started . Pure racism , I guess . " <p> I live in the Sands Motel now . Made a deal with the towelhead and he lets me live there free in trade for me being the dayman six days a week . Turns out he 's not such a bad sort after all . I got a TV and a VCR in my room and every night I lay up in bed with a box of AQ chicken and a cooler of beer and watch old game films , trying to keep my hand in . Tamika 's my biggest expense now . She 's the colored woman in room 69 . Late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifty dollars she charges for a half-and-half . It 's a special rate , since I 'm so regular . Once a week I call Vanessa and she comes over and joins in after the Booty Call closes . That costs me another $150 . The two of them like each other a lot . I could see that right off . Far as women go , then , the truth is I never had it better in my life . <p> First time Vanessa came over , she gave me my wallet back . It still had all the credit cards and neither of us said anything about the money she took . No point in stirring up trouble . Anyway I got no worries there . About money , I mean . Not for now at least . Morning I left jail , I went to the bank and got everything me and Cindy had in it out . Surprised me how much there was-more than twenty thousand dollars . And I cashed in my retirement too . Way I add it up , I can keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When everything else runs out , I 'll sell the Ram . I 'm living in shame , I guess , but nobody I ever see knows about it but Vanessa and Tamika and the towelhead , so what does it matter ? <p> Duane took over as head man at Blue Mountain , and he had a good year , losing in the second round of the playoffs . I sat in my truck on the hill overlooking the field and watched him beat Lafayette 38-6 . I was so torn I did n't even know who to root for . I never did give The Gardens of Gomorrah back to him . Sometimes me and my women lay up in bed and watch it together . At the end of the season , Yancey Tune retired . There was a big piece in the paper about him . It told about him and his Air Force son . It told about him building houses for Habitat for Humanity . It did n't say nothing about Cindy . You'd 've thought he was Mahatma Fucking Gandhi . <p> My trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer 's already got it delayed a couple of times . He thinks he can get me off without me having to do any time since I 'm ruined already . Yancey Tune 's not pressing any charges and he 's about talked the cop I hit into backing off too . I appreciate all that , I guess , but I know he 's just doing it to keep me from standing up in court and telling everybody what him and Cindy done to me . Anyway , whatever happens , I do n't reckon anybody 'll ever hire me to coach again . Even though I 've always been a winner . Still , I do n't want your sympathy . It 's like I used to tell my team after I 'd cussed them good and they commenced going all limp-necked and womanish on me . " You looking for sympathy , you can find it in the dictionary . It 's in there somewhere between shit and syphilis . " <p>                 @ @ @ @
