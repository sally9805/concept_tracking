It 's taken me almost a whole lifetime to become a decent liar . I still endure stabs of good-girl guilt about it , even though lying has started a brilliant second career for me . I tell stories easily , rarely missing a step as I switch between English and Japanese . But I often wonder how I ever got to this crazy place in life , and where I will go next . This day had been like all the others : a cool winter day in Monterey , with eight hours of classes at the Defense Language Institute , followed by my usual routine -- a run out to Lover of Jesus Point in Pacific Grove . On days like this one , I felt that the Pacific was my constant friend . The water was the divider between me and Japan , between my old life and the new one . I 'd have to cross it to go home . It was odd that I felt this way , I thought as I ran along the dirt trail that paralleled the coast . California was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours to the north , where my parents still lived . But Japan , where I 'd lived so briefly but happily teaching English and selling antiques , always beckoned . The sensation had been stronger on this day than at any time so far in the two months I 'd been studying at DLI , preparing for the kind of career in which you could n't tell anyone what youdid , but that could get me back to Japan . Good things are worth waiting for . I reminded myself of this truth as I ran , dressed for the winter in a long-sleeved black shirt really meant for bikers , and shorts , because I was too vain to wear sensible running tights . The wind on my legs did n't bother me ; but on my way back , my knee started throbbing , and I thought about how much I wanted to replace the Nike Airs . In Monterey , there were a few places to buy running shoes , but nothing with the vast array of choices that a thirty-year-old with fading knees required . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily get my favorite Asics style , but I was n't in the mood . I 'd been there at my family home for Christmas and New Year 's , a time when I found myself fending off a combination of unhealthy foods and intrusive questions . As much as I loved my parents , I could n't tell them about the Organization for Cultural Intelligence -- OCI -- the supersecret spy agency where I 'd been hired as a special informant . I also could n't explain why Hugh Glendinning , the man to whom I 'd once been semi-engaged , had thrown me out of his life and Washington , D.C. , apartment forever . But I would n't lie to my parents -- that would be completely against my internal code . So I chose not to talk . I actually liked the solitude of the Monterey coast , with its jagged rocks set against the turbulent , frigid Pacific : home of sardines , surfers , seals , and whales . Now I glanced toward the ocean , just to make sure I was n't going to miss the sunset . Another great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunsets over the Pacific : performance art in vivid shades of red , orange , and purple , each sunset unique , like the kanji characters I was studying . The sun took its leisurely time slipping down to the horizon , but as closely as I looked , I missed the green flash . I always seemed to miss it , even on the days when I 'd been with Hugh , vacationing in beautiful parts of Japan and Thailand , and he took pains to point it out . I never saw the same things he did . Perhaps that had been the problem . I shifted my gaze forward in the direction I was running , coming close to the Hopkins Marine Station , a research outpost connected to Stanford University . It had a beautiful rocky lookout point , but I 'd never gone out because the station had a high wire fence and many signs saying " keep out . " I was getting quite used to barriers , fences , and warning signs ; usually , the Department of Defense identification card that I carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no business at the station . Someone else did , though ; a solitary sightseer , who was out on the rocks with field glasses close to his face . I had noticed the same man half an hour earlier , because of what he was wearing : a business suit , which was a rarity in Monterey . I assumed he had to be some muckety-muck , though in my experience , marine scientists were more likely to wear jeans than gray flannel . Not that I could tell what the suit was made of : I was much too far away to make out those details , let alone the guy 's face . I imagined for a minute that he was a spy , watching the coast for his contact to come in . He was probably an out-of-control tourist who just wanted to take pictures -- though why he was n't looking seaward rather than at the recreation trail did n't make sense . It took me a couple of minutes to pass the rocky outcropping , then the rest of the fenced station , and then its exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to the side and tightened my shoelaces -- anything for more support . As I finished tying the knot , I turned around to look for bikers , always a liability on the trail , and I was stunned to see the man in the business suit running out of the marine station 's parking lot . Now I knew that what I 'd sensed earlier had been correct ; the field glasses had been trained on me , not on any form of sea life . I was fairly breathless because I 'd already been running for about half an hour , but I mustered an extra bit of power and began running toward the American Tin Cannery Outlets . The first place I saw was a Reebok outlet , but I ran on . . . Continues ...
