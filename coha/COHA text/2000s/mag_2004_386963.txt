The weather was bright and sunny as they set out to go scuba diving on New Year 's Eve in the Florida Keys . The spur-of-the-moment decision would have lasting repercussions . <p> It was 1980 . I 'd had my third aortic valve replacement Just twelve months before . Time was passing . My family was growing up . Teresa was twenty , Tom eighteen , Tony fifteen . I tried to take time away from the growing practice to enjoy life with them . After Christmas we went to Islamorada , Florida , in the Florida Keys . We took my nephew Billy Bob Radez , who is like a son to me . <p> Staying in the condo of a physician friend , Dr. Hussein Roushdi , of Community Hospital , we basked in the sun for a few days . Then , on December 31 , the boys and I decided to do some scuba diving . Tom and Billy Bob and I had been PADI certified in scuba diving at Lake Monroe in Indiana , and we were eager to get in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PADI certified , but he was probably the best diver of all of us . <p> I did n't think to tell my wife Wanda and Teresa where we were going . It was a spur-of-the-moment decision and like so many things in life , those sudden decisions can have lasting repercussions . In the case of those of us who went out on that boat , there were lifelong consequences . <p> It was New Year 's Eve and the marinas we tried had already rented out their boats . Finally , at a small marina , we were able to pick up a sixteen-footer with a 25 horsepower Evinrude motor . " That 'll be extra for wet suits . Do you want ' em ? " the marina man asked . It seemed like a lot of money for this small , sort of old boat and the wetsuits . We did take the wetsuits with us . We set our course for Tennessee Reef , which is seven miles from Islamorada on the Atlantic side . <p> The day was bright , the weather Christmas-sunny . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , saw some barracudas and angelfish to our satisfaction , and then surfaced . It was four o'clock and the waves were rising ; apparently the weather had suddenly taken a turn for the worse . We got into the boat and pulled the starter cord to start back , with Billy Bob driving . Soon we saw the waves were so high they were breaking over the bow and into the boat . <p> William Nasser and his son Tony enjoy a freshly harvested coconut before starting on their New Year 's Eve expedition to Tennessee Reef . <p> The motor flooded out and the boat started sinking . The next white cap swamped the boat and we were suddenly left in the Atlantic Ocean with nothing but four life preservers and a duffel bag . Apparently the boat had no built-in flotation factors to keep it afloat , though we had n't thought about that before . I thought of the barracudas we saw and wondered whether they really did attack people ; the water was clear and only ten feet deep , but we were seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a flashing light marker not far off that we could swim to , but that did n't seem too promising . " Let 's ditch our duffel bag and extra equipment and swim for shore , " one of the boys said . We put the wallets inside the top of the wet suits Tom and Tony wore . <p> The four of us started out together . Soon the sun began to set , and as clouds streaked the orange colored sky , I shouted over to the others , " Is n't that the most beautiful sunset you 've ever seen ? " And Tony yelled back , " No , Dad , that 's the worse sunset I 've ever seen , because once the sun sets , it gets very black on the ocean . " And that 's what happened . <p> A mecca for vacationers , Florida 's Tennessee Reef lies seven miles out from the Atlantic side of Islamorada Key . The water there is clear as crystal and only 10 feet deep . The reef is marked by a lighthouse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom yelled over at me , " Dad , you 're still recovering from that surgery  --  I do n't think you can swim to shore , can you ? Billy Bob and I will swim for shore and send back help . " <p> Tom , my oldest son , and my nephew Billy Bob reluctantly took leave of us , because they were the strongest swimmers and really our best hope for survival . " This is a matter of life and death , " Tom said solemnly as he left , and stroked off strongly in the direction of the sunset . <p> Tony stayed with me . We continued swimming and joked a bit between ourselves , but we both knew the situation was every bit as serious as Tom had said . A front had come in ; the winds blew hard and the air temperature was rapidly dropping  --  and so was the water temperature . <p> It seemed like an eternity that we swam on , water slapping at our faces , as we swallowed and stroked , finding welcome lobster buoys to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hours passed . Where were Tom and Billy Bob ? Had they reached shore ? Found the Coast Guard ? We did n't know , and I was growing dazed , worn out . <p> " I 'm cold , Dad , " Tony shouted over . He had a wet suit on , with gloves . I had only my Mae West life preserver . I was n't feeling cold , probably because I was becoming hypothermic . <p> I could n't see Tony , and he could n't see me . Just two black heads bobbing in the Atlantic . At midnight , ahead , we saw fireworks . The town was celebrating , and distant sprays of yellow light bursts and red and blue trails lit up the sky . Hope dawned just a little . That was the shore , straight ahead , but it was still at least a mile off . And because the lobster buoy we were seeing was not getting closer as we kept swimming , not even staying parallel , Tony could tell that the current was carrying us farther out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the scuba diving party left the main causeway at Marathon , Florida , and headed out toward Tennessee Reef . <p> Dr. Nasser meets the first President Bush . In addition to surviving his ordeal in the sea , the award-winning cardiologist is the recipient of three aortic valve heart procedures , a pacemaker-defibrillator , and a liver transplant . <p> Water splashed into my mouth with each wave that came towards us . My old , standard-issue orange life jacket was water-logged . " Tony , I ca n't make it , " I shouted . " Swim for your life . " <p> " Dad , I love you , and if we 're going to die , we will die together . I wo n't leave you . " We held to each other , had a good cry , and then he pressed on , trying to decide how to keep his increasingly incoherent father , wearing a water-logged lifejacket , above water . Tony decided to keep me afloat by securing his own life preserver to me and getting rid of my defective one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tony says he prayed , and to my great wonder to this day , he meant it . <p> Meanwhile , Wanda and Teresa were frantic . We had n't told them we 'd be gone anywhere , and we had n't returned to go out to dinner New Year 's Eve . Where in the world were Dad and the boys ? they fretted . Teresa was dating Tony Tanoos , whose father was the Assistant Police Chief in Terre Haute Indiana . She and Wanda called and asked Assistant Chief Tom Tanoos what they should do . The male members of the vacation party had not returned ; it was getting late at night . <p> " I 'll call the Coast Guard and they can start a search . They 'll want to talk to you , " he said . <p> By nine o'clock or so , the Marina owner had called the Coast Guard to say a small rented boat had not come back . The authorities did n't know who to call ; the condo had an unlisted number , and anyway we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break for the frantic , waiting family occurred when Billy Bob and Tom arrived on shore . Now that Assistant Police Chief Tanoos had established communication , the police and Coast Guard knew the condo number and called to say that two people had been pulled from the water and were at Fisherman 's Hospital in nearby Marathon . No word on whether the other two were dead or alive . <p> We , of course , had taken the car and parked it at the marina , so there was no way for Wanda and Teresa to get to the hospital . My wife and daughter , feeling close to hysteria , begged a ride from a neighbor boy who was sitting with them , and they rushed to Fisherman 's Hospital . Tom was on a gurney , extremely weak , so Wanda talked to Billy Bob . " Where are Uncle Bill and Tony ? " <p> Billy Bob was weak , his voice hollow . " Aunt Wanda , I do n't know where they are . They are out there somewhere . " Later they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't go on , asking Billy Bob to piggyback him in . Later Tom said when he saw the Titanic movie , he understood how those poor souls in the jackets , floating near the lifeboats in all that icy darkness , felt . You just fade out and fall asleep . Those last few miles , Billy Bob ferried his cousin , who held on to him in a " death grip " as he continued in his odd , crawling dog paddle with the life jackets for flotation . They , too , saw the lights of the fireworks , and when Billy Bob put his feet down , he touched sand . " Wake up , Tom , " he called to the passenger he was towing in . " We 're here and they 're putting up fireworks to celebrate our arrival . " Tom did n't answer . They headed more directly to the beach . <p> At Fisherman 's Hospital in Marathon Key , Dr. Nasser recuperates following his ordeal in the Atlantic . <p> When they reached the shore , Tom was hypothermic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just leave me alone . I 'm going to rest a minute . " He lay his face down in the shallow water and Billy Bob had to drag him up onto the beach . At that point Billy Bob was worried for Tom 's life  --  he was freezing cold and unconscious . He recalls trying to warm Tom up by burying him in a little pit under a palm tree and covering him with beach pine needles and leaves . Then he told Tom , " I have to leave you now , Tom , to find help . " <p> Billy Bob wandered up to the road and saw car lights coming . He determined to stand right in the middle of the road , hoping the car would stop before it hit him . A young couple took him to the sheriffs office : an ambulance was sent to the beach , where they found Tom up and staggering around , yelling at nobody and everybody . Billy Bob and Tom were taken to Fisherman 's Hospital . Both boys were barely able to talk now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up at this point . <p> " Out there  --  no ! " she said . " We need to know where they are exactly . We 'll go out and get them . " She tried to find out more from Tom . " I just do n't know where they are , " he told her , struggling to find his voice . He raised his hand weakly and clenched his fist . " But I can tell you this . Dad is strong . They 'll make it . " <p> The doctors took over then , and Wanda and Teresa turned to talk to the authorities , who could not hold out much hope . They explained to Wanda that her husband and son Tony had been in the cold water a long time . It was pitch black . Their chances for survival were not good . <p> The Coast Guard began to search the black ocean . Teresa stayed with her brother Tom in the hospital ; Wanda took Billy Bob back to the condo ; there was n't anything else to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last hours of that night . They said Tony put his life jacket on me and kept swimming around , hoping for rescue . We were about one mile from shore , but had drifted five miles south of our destination because of the tidal currents . The cold salt water had formed a film on my glasses ; Tony took them off and put them inside his wet suit . <p> Wearing their " survivor " T-shirts , the Nassers and friends celebrate with a champagne toast at a survival party in 1997 . The annual family tradition , held at midnight on New Year 's Eve , is always an emotional experience . <p> In desperation , there all alone , with his strength going and his legs cramping and the waves still splashing and the tide pushing us out farther , he prayed to God to give him the strength to get us through . " I ca n't do this alone , " was his prayer . <p> Then , miraculously , he recounts that the waves grew calmer , the water seemed warmer , his strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew nearer . <p> The Coast Guard helicopters were overhead that night , but they could not see us , black heads floating on a black sea . When it grew light , a Coast Guard cutter spotted us and were delighted to see that Tony was waving , seemingly alive and fairly well . I was unconscious ; they could n't tell if I was alive or dead . <p> Someone leaned over the rail , looking at Tony from ten feet up . " Are you the Nassers ? " the Coast Guard officer yelled . Tony told them we were , but he feared his dad had a stroke or was dead . <p> They lowered a gurney down into the water . Tony put me on the gurney , but the hook slipped as I was going into the boat , and I ended up back in the water . Tony re-tied me again and put me back on the gurney , and this time they were able to lift me , then Tony , into the boat . <p> I did have a pulse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from severe hypothermia . I was dusky and blue . They rushed me to shore where the Coast Guard cruiser docked at a pier . An ambulance was waiting to take me to Fisherman 's Hospital in Marathon . So I 'm told . <p> My first memory is waking up with lovely young ladies staring down at me . I was in a tub of circulating warm water ; they were warming me up gradually . But my first thought was that these beautiful apparitions were angels , that I had died and gone to heaven . <p> My body temperature was eighty-seven degrees Fahrenheit , and my heart rate had slowed to approximately thirty beats per minute . I was turned into a sea animal , I guess , with a lower metabolism than human beings . I was bordering on death . My lungs were filled with seawater . I believe that if the waves had not calmed down before morning  --  a great spiritual gift , so Tony was able to have increased spiritual , physical and mental strength  --  we might not have made it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the hospital , wearing a hospital gown . In the photo I 'm supposed to be " improving . " My body temperature by that time has been raised , and the water was out of my lungs . But I look like " death warmed over , " an apt phrase in my ease at that moment . <p> Epilogue : <p> Billy Bob had saved Tom 's life . He had hypothermia and had to be admitted to the hospital . <p> Tony was so little harmed by his sixteen-hour stint in the freezing water that he seemed to his mother and sister like he 'd come home from a late-night party . He won the American Red Cross Hero of the Year Award for what he did to save my life that stormy night off Islamorada in the Florida Keys . <p> Every New Year 's Eve since , our family and a few friends have had a Survival Party . We go with our children and other family members on a New Year 's Eve cruise in the Caribbean . Everybody goes out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean from the stern .
