<p> WEST HOLLYWOOD  --  Will soulful teen Paris Bennett , hunky Ace Young or winsome warbler Katharine McPhee be the next American Idol ? What about Southern-fried Bucky Covington , pop-rocker Chris Daughtry or R &B; belter Mandisa ? <p> Your guess is as good as anyone 's . Even the judges are stumped . <p> " Everything 's open this year , is n't it ? There are four , five , six people who could win , " Simon Cowell says . He singles out Daughtry , Taylor Hicks and Mandisa as favorites . <p> Randy Jackson , standing on the red carpet with Cowell last week at a party for the 12 new Idol finalists , adds McPhee and Kellie Pickler to the list . " I think America made the right choices . It 's a better balance . You got some pretty good boys , you got some pretty good girls . " <p> That balance , along with what many say is the singing competition 's deepest talent pool yet , could help TV 's most-watched series maintain its record ratings pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevie Wonder songs tonight ( Fox , 8 ET/PT ) ; Wonder himself performs Wednesday ( 9 ET/PT ) . <p> Averaging 30.4 million viewers , Idol 's fifth edition is running 12% ahead of last season , reversing the usual pattern of audience decline over time . <p> " That 's what 's remarkable about it . After five seasons , it 's still on the upswing , and viewers find it just as fresh as they did " when it premiered in 2002 , says Brad Adgate of ad buyer Horizon Media . ( By comparison , The Apprentice hit a series low for a regular episode , 9.7 million viewers , with its recent fifth-edition premiere . ) <p> As sales of albums and movie tickets slump , Americans ' appetite for Idol 's karaoke boot camp seems insatiable . The program clobbered the Winter Olympics and the Grammy Awards , and two audition shows drew more 18-to-49-year-olds , TV 's money demographic , than the usually dominant Oscars . <p> Fox reality chief Mike Darnell says Idol has made the rare jump from network hit to national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in a community . Right now , TV is n't giving them many things . And the scheduling of it once a year has made its event status bigger . " <p> Darnell also says changes to the semifinal last season , such as having all singers perform each week and splitting the men and women , helped flatten out the traditional midseason trough , generating more momentum going into the finals . And he says the personalities make the show more compelling . " I hear people referring to them not ( only ) by name but by persona : ' He 's the bald rocker . ' ' He 's the gray-haired guy . ' ' She 's the country girl . ' You have such unique personalities , people are connecting with them . " <p> The finalists got a taste of their newfound celebrity at last week 's party , where photographers called out their names and fans tried to capture them on cellphone cameras . " This is so weird . I went from a roller-skating waitress at Sonic to walking on the red carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Rolling Stone contributing editor , is n't surprised by Idol 's clout . " You ca n't underestimate the degree to which people are drawn to a show about singing . It 's one of the only contests on TV where the talent element is something anyone could have . Everyone can sing , no matter how badly . " <p> Tighter competition may stave off Idol fatigue , she says , noting that long before Carrie Underwood was crowned in May , Cowell predicted her victory . " It 's not clear at all who 's going to win , and I do n't think even the judges know , " Eliscu says . <p> Her faves ? Hicks , despite his affectations . Also Bennett , Elliott Yamin and precocious Pickler , " merely an average singer , but you ca n't not love her . " Oh , and the videogenic Young . " Please gouge out my eyes so I can stop looking and drooling . " <p> She 's pleased to see " the shticky singers are getting weeded out sooner in lieu of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to appeal to a broad range . " <p> Nevertheless , even judges and producers do n't agree with all the top 12 picks . Cowell and Jackson say Gedeon McKinney should still be competing . Executive producer Ken Warwick laments the departure of Ayla Brown but says such unpredictability keeps people watching . In the end , " I think the public gets it right . It might be a rocky road , but great . That 's what we want . " <p> The personality factor could come into play this week . In e-mail interviews , viewers say boyish Kevin Covais is a likable teen but predict he 'll be first to go . Covais " needs to go home . He 's sweet , ( but ) he 's completely overshadowed by many of the other talented people in this year 's final 12 , " says Jennifer Harris-Frowen , 34 , of Fayetteville , Ark . <p> Idol 's ability to tap into different musical genres has helped it develop a deeper talent pool , music consultant Tom Vickers says . " It 's broadening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop and R &B.; Last year , I got the feeling it was playing itself out . This year , it has a new energy that feels more real . " <p> For Jim Murphy , 46 , of Auburn , N.Y. , Idol " reminds me of the show Extreme Makeover : Home Edition in that you root for people to overcome adversity and shine , and in that it is one of the few shows that people of all ages can watch together . In our living room , there are three generations watching . " <p> This higher talent quotient should make for a more suspenseful countdown and livelier water-cooler debates , particularly with fewer clunkers in the final dozen . <p> " When the show was at 12 finalists last year , you could see which six or seven needed to go , " Daily Variety associate editor Phil Gallo says . He notes that producers seem less intent on manipulating audience perceptions . " Last year , the producers did subtle things , like using the word ' rocker ' for anyone with long hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clay Aiken or Kelly Clarkson retreads . This year , it seems they 've calmed down . " <p> Gallo says the male finalists feature a broader repertoire , but the women are " way ahead " in talent and potential . " Mandisa is powerful and has tremendous breath and pitch control , and there 's no reason that woman should be working as anything other than a singer , " he says . " Paris blows me away . She appeals in her demeanor and her humility . I like Kellie and Lisa ( Tucker ) . " <p> Idol 's runaway success " points to a desire for freshness " in an era in which music is consumed and discarded quickly , Gallo says . That is evident in Idol-spawned recording efforts that have not matched the show 's soaring TV trajectory . Subsequent winners have not fared as well as the inaugural Kelly Clarkson , and finalists who do n't land in the top two spots " are lucky to sell 12,000 copies of a record . " <p> Mitch Schneider , who heads the MSO music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , David Bowie and Depeche Mode , is impressed with the show but suspects its high notes will sour before long . " Right now , it 's giving the audience this sensation of empowerment , " he says . " In the audition stage , it 's like The Gong Show , pure comic humiliation . As the elimination process begins , it 's like watching cruise-ship passengers being tossed overboard , and the audience gets to push . It 's strangely titillating . The audience can take pride in saying , ' We picked Kelly Clarkson and created a superstar . ' There 's something perversely wonderful about Idol trouncing the Grammys . " <p> But Idol ca n't sustain this height without more adjustments , Schneider predicts , and its decline wo n't be for lack of intriguing contestants . " It will be a combination of predictable material and the judges ' hackneyed comments . They 're going to run out of popular songs . There 's this beeline to cover Celine Dion and Mariah Carey , because those songs have money notes if you can climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to hear ? What 's frustrating is the lack of cutting-edge songs . " <p> Some fans see a sameness in the judges ' comments . " The Randy-and-Paula ( Abdul ) block vs . Simon seems to be getting more intense and ... a bit boring , " says Deirdre Biles , 49 , of Lexington , Ky. , who praises Cowell 's honesty . " I would like to see more constructive criticism from them other than ' Dude , you chose the wrong song . ' " <p> Although Schneider says Jackson 's " dawg pound " gimmick , Abdul 's syrup and Cowell 's snarls have grown stale , he never tires of a simple refrain : " I do like it when Simon says , ' Your voice is never going to be heard on the radio . ' That 's the ultimate reality check . "
