MUROROA ATOLL TUAMOTO ISLANDS FRENCH POLYNESIA JUNE 14 , 1992 One hundred and seventy feet above the concrete launch pad , Roberta Lincoln crawled out onto one of the horizontal swing arms of the towering rocket gantry . A small green gecko scurried out of her way as the fortyish American woman clambered on her hands and knees across the steel bridge toward her target : an Ariane rocket primed for takeoff . The more things change , the more they really do stay the same , Roberta thought wryly . Twenty-five years ago , her longtime friend and supervisor , Gary Seven , had crept across a similar elevated platform to sabotage another rocket launch . His mission then had been to prevent a weapon of mass destruction from being launched into orbit , initiating a full-scale outer space arms race . A quarter century later , Roberta 's agenda was pretty much the same . The only difference is that this time I 'm the one performing without a net . Just to play it safe , however , she clipped one end of a safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end securely attached to her belt . A cool , dry wind rustled her honey-blond hair as she came within reach of the powerful European booster rocket , designed to place commercial satellites in orbit high above the Earth . Roberta briefly wondered what kind of bribes and/or extortion Khan had employed to get his hands on the Ariane , let alone transport it to this remote launch site in the South Pacific , previously occupied by the French government 's now-defunct nuclear testing program . From her lofty perch uponthe gantry , Roberta could look out over the entire atoll : a circular ring of greenery surrounding a large moonlit lagoon . Leafy palm trees and mangroves covered much of the island , although she could also spot the lights of the Mission Control center , nestled amidst the lush tropical flora . " Let 's just hope they do n't spot me , " she whispered to herself , acutely aware that her green camouflage shorts and tank top , which had blended perfectly with the tropical shrubbery on her way here , now clashed alarmingly with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their most recent intel , Khan himself intended to be present for this launch , and Roberta sincerely hoped to get in and out of Muroroa without actually running into the man himself . The last thing I need right now is a reunion with that smug , so-called superman , she thought . She and Seven had their hands full these days , coping with the crisis in Bosnia , not to mention all the other international mischief stirred up by Khan and his genetically engineered siblings . In their eagerness to assert their self-proclaimed destinies as rulers of the Earth , the Children of Chrysalis , as Roberta still thought of them , had sparked civil wars and unrest all over the globe , in Eastern Europe , Liberia , Somalia , Peru , and elsewhere . This had not made her and Seven 's primary mission  --  preventing World War III  --  any easier . And to think that , after the Cold War ended , I had briefly thought that Seven and I could retire ! If anything , their job had gotten even more complicated since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to up the ante with this stunt ! Roberta scowled and glanced toward the horizon , glimpsing a faint rosy tint where the night sky met the Pacific . The Ariane was scheduled to launch at dawn , so Roberta knew she had to act soon ; the sun rose very quickly this close to the equator . Her all-purpose servo device , cunningly disguised as a silver fountain pen , projected a beam of white light onto the outer casing of the Ariane 's main rocket , which was flanked by two solid-fuel boosters , intended to provide the initial thrust upon lift-off . According to the diagrams she 'd memorized earlier , the rocket 's primary guidance system was just behind the metal panel directly in front of her , bearing the snazzy blue logo of Arianespace , the French manufacturer of the rocket . Roberta 's plan was to tweak the controls so that the rocket would self-destruct harmlessly in the upper atmosphere , taking its insidious cargo with it . With any luck , Khan 's latest scheme would be over before it even began . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about the twenty-five tons of liquid hydrogen stored beneath her , just waiting to be ignited , she switched the servo to laser mode and began cutting a hole in the side of the rocket with what she hoped was surgical precision . The ruby-red beam traced a charred black line around the company logo , quickly forming a complete loop . Roberta gave the melted metal a few minutes to cool , then carefully lifted the newly created circular segment away from the rest of the rocket , revealing the intricate circuitry beneath . Pretty smooth , she congratulated herself . A few deft moves and  --  voil  --  Khan 's high-tech hardware was more exposed than Sharon Stone . Grinning triumphantly , she cautiously laid the displaced metal disk aside , making sure it would n't topple off the edge of the gantry , and turned her servo back into a flashlight . She gripped the slender silver instrument between her teeth , to keep the incandescent beam focused in front of her , then reached carefully into the electronic innards of the Ariane satellite launcher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock . A moment before she lost consciousness , she thanked heaven for the safety cord binding her to the steel platform . At least she was n't going to fall to her death ! ... " She 's waking up , Your Excellency , " a gruff male voice intoned , penetrating the fog receding from her brain . Roberta struggled to lift her eyelids , half-surprised to find herself alive and not electrocuted . She suspected the good news ended there . " Thank you , Joaquin , " a familiar voice replied , confirming Roberta 's worst expectations . Oh no ! she thought , genuine apprehension sending a chill through her recently dormant body . As far as she could tell she seemed to be lying sideways on some sort of couch or cushion . Not him ! Blinking , she opened her eyes to see a tall Indian man looking down at her with an amused expression on his strong , handsome features . Piercing brown eyes inspected her as they might an exotic animal securely caged in a zoo ; that is , with total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean-shaven , with thick black hair tied neatly behind his head , and wore a spotless white Nehru jacket with matching cotton slacks . " Ah , Ms. Lincoln , " he greeted her with a mocking pretense of warmth . " How good of you to rejoin us ! " " Hello , Khan , " she said icily . Raising herself to a seated position , she tried to stand up , but found her legs still a little too wobbly . A quick glance around revealed that she was in a luxuriously appointed office decorated with traditional Polynesian art . An original Gauguin hung on one wall , while an authentic Melanesian wood carving of a cruising shark sat atop an executive-size desk . A colorful mat , woven from dyed pandanus fibers , carpeted the floor . Roberta did her best to meet Khan 's gaze defiantly , despite a profusion of tropical butterflies in her stomach . " Long time , no smirk . " Looming a few feet behind Khan , a large , muscular brute with a sullen expression and light-brown hair glowered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Schwarzenegger-size torso , above a pair of simple gray slacks . Compared to Khan 's crisp , snow-white suit , the scowling bruiser 's attire was dull and unremarkable , except for a large brass belt buckle that bore the visage of a snarling grizzly bear . " You will address His Excellency with more respect ! " he warned her balefully , raising a meaty hand as he stepped toward her ominously . She flinched in anticipation of the blow , which would no doubt carry the full force of genetically augmented bones and sinews . But Khan shook his head , dismissing his henchman 's concerns with an airy gesture . " No need to stand on formality , " he insisted . " Ms. Lincoln and I are old friends . " He smiled coldly at her . " Is n't that so ? " In a manner of speaking , Roberta admitted silently . She had first met Khan Noonien Singh eighteen years ago , in a vast underground laboratory hidden beneath the scorched sands of India 's desolate Great Thar Desert . Khan had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetically engineered children produced by the top-secret Chrysalis Project , but he had already possessed the confidence and charisma of a born ( or , in his case , manufactured ) leader . Even after she and Gary Seven had shut down the Chrysalis Project , they had kept careful track of Khan and the other superkids , now scattered throughout the world . Impressed by Khan 's obvious brilliance and potential for good , Seven had even made a determined effort to recruit the teenage Khan into their own covert peacekeeping operation , but that bright idea had backfired spectacularly ; in the end , Khan proved too ambitious to keep under control , and he had turned against her and Seven , stealing all their information on the Chrysalis Kids in the process . That was three years ago , and Khan had already rounded up several dozen of his supersmart and superstrong siblings , including Joaquin here , and enlisted them in his grandiose campaign to " save " the world by placing it under his complete and total control . Unfortunately , Roberta had the sneaking suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the close shave ? " she asked him glibly , stalling for time while she recovered from her shock-induced trip to dreamland . " The last time I saw you , back in eighty-nine , you were sporting a respectable-looking beard . I thought that was mandatory for all male Sikhs ? " Khan nodded , smiling appreciatively . " Very good , Ms. Lincoln . I applaud your cross-cultural erudition . " He thoughtfully stroked his smooth and stubble-free chin . " With all due respect to my heroic Sikh ancestors , however , I eventually came to the conclusion that I should not be bound by the traditions of the past . I am a new breed of human being , after all . A new and superior kind of warrior . Thus , on my twenty-first birthday , I shaved off my beard , in recognition of the revolutionary turning point that I , and the others like me , represent in the history of human evolution . Henceforth , I resolved , I would make my own traditions , chart a new path for mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ever , " Roberta observed dryly . As discreetly as possible , she searched her pockets for her servo , but the versatile device eluded her fingers . Had she dropped it back on the gantry , or had Khan and his people confiscated it ? " Frankly , I always kind of hoped that your delusions of grandeur were just a phase you were going through , something you 'd outgrow eventually . " She stopped fishing for the servo and started looking for an escape route ; from what she could see , the office had only a single exit . " I guess that was wishful thinking . " Khan scowled , his bogus bonhomie slipping . " Hardly delusions , Ms. Lincoln , " he said curtly . " Or have you forgotten how easily I have eluded you and the enigmatic Mr. Seven these past few years , despite the considerable resources at your command ? " True enough , Roberta conceded . Using data stolen from Seven 's advanced Beta 5 computer , Khan had even found a way to protect his strongholds against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more primitive techniques in their periodic attempts to infiltrate Khan 's hideouts and headquarters . Just to reach Muroroa , in fact , Roberta had needed to teleport to another island , several miles south of this one , then brave the treacherous currents and coral reefs in an outrigger canoe until she came close enough to the forbidden atoll to jump overboard and scuba-dive the rest of the way , dodging sharks , moray eels , and poisonous jellyfish as she swam to shore not far from the rocket launch pad . A damp wet suit , along with a set of oxygen tanks , were presumably still hidden amidst the sword-shaped leaves of the bushes at the edge of the shore . Sadly , the scuba gear was too far away to do her much good at the moment . Some South Seas vacation this is turning out to be , she thought sarcastically . " Maybe we 've been keeping our eyes on you all along , " she challenged Khan , then wondered if she had said too much . What if Khan demanded to know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we found out what you were up to here . Even Seven never thought you 'd go this far .... " Khan 's face hardened . " Seven has always lacked vision , " he said scornfully . " That is why he is content to skulk in the margins of history , when he possesses the means to do so much more . And why I broke with him years ago . The problems of the world require bold , decisive action , not timid , cautious half-measures of the sort you and Seven specialize in . " Roberta did n't back down . " We put out fires . You start them . That 's a big difference , as far as I am concerned . " " Fire can be a transforming force , Ms. Lincoln , " he stated , " clearing away the rotting debris of the past and making room for new growth . " He lifted the carved wooden shark from his desk , crushed it to splinters within his fist , then wiped the dusty residue from his palms . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where exactly is Gary Seven at this moment ? Can we anticipate his arrival as well , in an attempt to rescue you , or perhaps complete your mission ? " I wish , Roberta thought . In fact , Seven was currently attending a key environmental summit in Rio , while recovering from injuries sustained during the fall of Kabul a few months back . Despite his own superhuman physique , the result of years of selective breeding on a planet light-years away , Seven was in no shape to stage a commando raid on the secluded and well-protected island . " For someone with a superior brain , " she told Khan , " your math needs work . Seven is in his sixties now ; he lets me handle all the house calls . " This was a slight exaggeration , but close enough to the truth that she hoped Khan would buy it . Over the years , she had indeed taken over more and more of the field work , leaving Seven to concentrate on the big picture . One of these days , we really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she mused . Heaven knows I could use some backup right now . " So Seven is finally feeling his years , is he ? " Khan 's voice assumed a magnanimous tone , leading Roberta to suspect that he had taken her protestations at face value . " In a way , this saddens me . In his own fashion , he was a worthy adversary . " A buzzer sounded behind Khan and he strode across the spacious office to answer the intercom on the desk . " Khan here , " he declared crisply . " What is our status ? " " We 're about ten minutes from launching , sir , " a disembodied voice spoke from the intercom . Roberta thought she detected a trace of a Scottish accent , along with the distinctly deferential tone . Her heart sank at the implications of the announcement . She had n't prevented the launch at all ; the Ariane was still ready to deliver its obscene payload into orbit . I 've failed , she realized . " Excellent , " Khan pronounced , switching off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy to say , Ms. Lincoln , that your feeble attempt at sabotage cost us merely half an hour , not nearly enough time to cause us to miss our launch window . " Stepping away from the desk , he stared down at her like an adult scolding a wayward child . " You should have remembered that you were dealing with an intelligence deliberately engineered to exceed your own ; anticipating sabotage , I had the foresight to install a fail-safe advice into the Ariane 's guidance systems against any such interference . " He smiled condescendingly , pleased by his own remarkable foresight . " My apologies if my countermeasures came as something of , well , a shock to your system . " Very funny , Roberta thought acidly . " Well , as surprises go , it was n't exactly up there with The Crying Game . " She 'd be damned if she was going to feed Khan 's already gargantuan ego . " But , yeah , I suppose it caught me a little off guard . " Too bad my informant failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamented . Guess that was one secret Khan was keeping under even tighter wraps than usual .... " Your spirit is admirable , " he acknowledged , annoyingly unshaken by Roberta 's faint praise , " even if your accomplishments are not . " He marched toward the office 's only exit . " Bring her , " he instructed Joaquin , who grabbed her roughly by the arm and yanked her to her feet . His bruising grip reminded her of Carlos , the hulking guardian of the old Chrysalis Project  --  and one of the project 's earliest genetic experiments . She wondered if Joaquin 's muscles had been souped-up with gorilla DNA , too . Following Khan , Joaquin dragged her out the door . A short flight of steps later , they arrived on the roof of the Mission Control building . The sun was newly risen , Roberta noted , providing her with a panoramic view of the picturesque island and its enclosed lagoon . Rising high above the swaying palm trees , on the opposite side of the tranquil blue waters , the Ariane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seas scenery . Observing her gaze , Khan threw out his arms expansively . His pristine white suit reflected the bright morning sunshine . " Welcome , Ms. Lincoln , to Chrysalis Island ! " Roberta refused to concede even the loveliness of the setting . " I thought the whole place belonged to the French , " she retorted . As a matter of fact , as she well knew , the French government had established the Centre d'Experimentation du Pacifique ( CEP ) on Muroroa back in 1963 , as a testing site for atomic weapons , many of which had been exploded underground in artificial caverns carved out of the island 's basalt core . Less than three months ago , however , France had suspended its nuclear testing program indefinitely , much to the relief of most of the world . Little did that world know , Roberta mused , that Muroroa was now playing host to something just as nasty  --  and possibly even more dangerous  --  - than underground nuclear explosions . And she did n't just mean Khan . " Our Gallic friends were under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . Roberta recalled seeing news footage of anti-nuke protests on Fiji and the other islands . " Thus , I managed to ' persuade ' certain French authorities to let me take it off their hands  --  discreetly , of course . " Roberta could just imagine what kind of " persuasion " Khan had employed . Extortion ? Blackmail ? Assassination ? It would n't be the first time , she thought ; although she and Seven never uncovered definitive proof of Khan 's involvement , they had their suspicions regarding a number of recent tragic events , such as the explosive death of that big-name Indian politician last spring . " Indeed , " Khan continued , " this entire complex is perfectly suited to my needs , being equipped with its own electrical generators , desalination plant , airfield , communications center , and so forth , while its location near the equator makes it an ideal site for launching satellites into orbit . " He looked out over the sprawling compound , which was guarded on all sides by a high , fully electrified fence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , improving on what the French left behind . " " I ca n't wait for the guided tour , " Roberta said , not entirely sarcastic . With any luck , she would get a chance to scope out Khan 's new real estate , before or after she attempted to escape . A small cluster of people had gathered atop the roof to witness the launch of the rocket . Loudspeakers mounted at the rear of the roof provided a countdown toward the rapidly approaching lift-off : " Launch minus two minutes . " Khan toyed with his wristwatch , synchronizing it with the countdown , before strolling across the whitewashed rooftop to join the others . He gestured for Joaquin to bring Roberta along . " Okay , okay , I 'm coming ! " she muttered irritably as the thuggish henchman hustled her across the rooftop . Looking away from the distant gantry , Khan 's associates eyed her with varying degrees of curiosity , seemingly none too concerned by her status as an unwilling captive . " Launch minus one minute , thirty seconds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to introduce a few of the brilliant minds that I have assembled , at great effort and expense , on this island . This is Dr. Liam MacPherson , " he began , indicating a lanky , red-haired man in a white lab jacket , " a superlative astrophysicist and the head of launch operations . Doctor , meet Ms. Roberta Lincoln , an uninvited guest at today 's event . " MacPherson gave Roberta a cursory examination before turning his attention back to the prepped and pregnant rocket on the launch pad . A compact headset kept him in touch with Mission Control and he stroked his beard , a tuft of coppery bristles , absentmindedly as he whispered instructions into his mike . Roberta did n't take the snub personally , figuring that MacPherson was naturally preoccupied with the Ariane 's imminent departure . " Pleased to meet you , sort of , " Roberta murmured , even though the carrot-topped astrophysicist was clearly not listening . " Let 's do this again sometime . " " And this , " Khan continued , moving onto an exotically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching top , " is the most exquisite Ament , one of my wisest and most trusted advisors . " Gleaming black pearls , native to the Tuamoto Islands , shimmered upon her earlobes , the nacreous beads as dark and lustrous as her shoulder-length black hair . Cool , amber eyes looked Roberta over silently , conveying an air of haughty amusement . Her lithe , languid body seemed both youthful and timeless . Roberta disliked her on principle . " Nice pearls , " she stated flatly , figuring that if you ca n't say something nice about a person , you can always compliment their jewelry . " Thank you , " Ament said coolly . Her low , husky voice had a faintly Arabic accent . " They were a gift from Khan . " He nodded , his hands clasped behind his back . " I wrested them myself from the giant black-lipped oysters found only in these islands . Did you know , Ms. Lincoln , " he expounded , " that a Polynesian pearl diver can descend up to forty meters in search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although , of course , easily within my own abilities . " " Everybody needs a hobby , " Roberta said dryly . A little more pearl diving , a little less geopolitical powermongering , she reflected , and the whole world would be a happier place . " More like an invigorating diversion , " Khan stated by way of clarification . He walked to the edge of the rooftop , the better to observe the rocket on its launch pad . " Not that today requires any stimulation beyond what we are about to witness . " " Launch minus sixty seconds , " the loudspeaker announced , calling an end to the introductions . A hush of anticipation fell over the small grouping on the roof . On the launch pad across the turquoise lagoon , the massive metal structure of the gantry retreated from the Ariane , leaving the slender rocket alone upon the launch , pointed up at the sky like a gigantic blue-and-white hypodermic . An appropriate image , Roberta thought , given the high-tech poison carried in its payload . " Launch minus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base of the Ariane as its twin booster rockets fired . A deafening roar assaulted Roberta 's eardrums , like a dozen jumbo jets taking off at once , and she fought an urge to clamp her hands over her ears , unwilling to show any weakness in front of Khan and his fellow bermenschen . Instead , she crossed her fingers , hoping in vain that something would still go wrong with the launch , that the Ariane would blow up on the launch pad . I 'm sorry , Gary . She was barely able to hear her own thoughts over the volcanic fury of the unleashed engines , which were straining mightily at the bolts still holding the rocket to the concrete pad . I tried to stop him . " Launch minus thirty seconds . " The roar increased as the Ariane 's main engines kicked in . Twenty-five tons of liquid hydrogen ignited , sending a rush of superheated gases through the engine nozzles , propelling the massive spacecraft against the pull of gravity . " Look , Ms. Lincoln ! " Khan shouted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunderous din . Roberta tried to pull away from him , but Joaquin 's heavy hands clamped down on her shoulders , holding her in place . " How fortunate you recovered just in time to behold my greatest triumph to date ! " Lucky me , she thought , unable to look away from the fiery spectacle . " Launch minus one second ... " The towering rocket rose from the launch pad , borne aloft by a blazing pillar of fire . Gigantic clouds of steam , produced by the explosive union of the Ariane 's red-hot exhaust with a flood of cooling water released in conjunction with the blast-off , swelled outward , hiding the launch site behind a churning , turbulent curtain of vapor . " Lift-off ! " the loudspeaker exulted . " We have lift-off ! " Almost against her will , Roberta tipped her head back to follow the rocket 's meteoric ascent . She held her breath , still praying that , somehow , someway , the Ariane , along with its malignant cargo , would go the way of the Challenger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she prayed , let Khan 's diabolical plan blow up in his face ! But nothing of the sort occurred . The lift-off was flawless , with the Ariane 's upward trajectory achieving escape velocity within less than a minute . As the rocket disappeared from sight , leaving only a snow-white trail of vapor behind , Liam MacPherson breathed a sigh of relief . Beneath his lab coat , his shoulders slumped as the weight of his worries evaporated in the cool trade winds . Ament led the rest of the onlookers , excepting Roberta , in a round of polite applause . Khan 's flawless profile remained turned to the sky , toward the apex of the vapor trail . Roberta wondered if the Indian prodigy 's superior vision had allowed him to follow the rocket 's soaring climb longer than she had . " Ah , Lucifer , child of the morning , " he declaimed proudly , twisting the Old Testament to his own vainglorious purposes . " How thou art risen ! " Lowering his gaze at last , he savored Roberta 's crestfallen expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trust , Ms. Lincoln , that you appreciate the full purpose and potential of my Morning Star , my bringer of light ? " More than I 'd like to , Roberta thought unhappily , knowing that her job had just gotten a lot more difficult . " You stole the technology from us , remember ? " Her voice hardened at the memory . " The day you raided our office and murdered our computer ? " Images of a younger Khan firing a hail of bullets into the good old Beta 5 flashed before her mind 's eye . She could still hear the gunshots .... " Technology , " he reminded her , holding up a finger in correction , " that Seven and I personally acquired from the ageless Dr. Evergreen , and not without considerable effort and hardship . I am as much entitled to the fruits of that enterprise as your unbearably self-righteous superior . " Roberta knew what Khan was referring to , even though she had not taken part in those events . It had been that ill-fated mission , back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven that the precocious Sikh youth was too reckless ( and ruthless ) to be trusted . Just like his mother , she thought , recalling the late Dr. Sarina Kaur , founder and driving force of the Chrysalis Project . Kaur had been utterly ruthless , too , and fanatical enough to choose death rather than abandon Chrysalis , which had ultimately been consumed by a fierce thermonuclear conflagration beneath the deserts of Rajasthan . Roberta could n't help wondering if Khan had ever figured out that she and Seven had been indirectly responsible for his mother 's tragic demise . Probably not a good time to bring that up , she decided . " Excuse me , sir , " MacPherson broke in , " but the rocket has achieved a low polar orbit . We 're ready to deploy the satellite . " He tugged on his beard nervously . " Perhaps you 'd care to join me in Mission Control ? " Khan must be a tough boss , Roberta guessed from the scientist 's apprehensive manner . Even for another superman . She 'd recognized MacPherson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Chrysalis children . She pretty much knew the entire list by heart . Khan scowled momentarily , unhappy to be interrupted while fencing verbally with Roberta . Larger aims took precedence , however , and he nodded curtly . " Of course , Doctor , I will be with you shortly . " He gave Roberta a parting bow . " We will have to continue our reunion later , Ms. Lincoln . The Bard once wrote that , ' Unbidden guests are often welcomest when they are gone , ' but in your case I 'm inclined to enjoy your company a while longer . " He reached into the pocket of his immaculately pressed white slacks and retrieved a familiar silver instrument . My servo ! Roberta thought , dismayed to see the device in Khan 's possession . " I look forward to chatting with you , " he stated , " about the many singular technologies at your superior 's disposal ; in particular , your miraculous means of teleportation . " He deftly rolled the servo between his fingers and across the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have developed ways to block your ingenious matter-transmission beams , I have not yet succeeded in duplicating them . " After tantalizing Roberta with its proximity , he returned the captured servo to his pocket . " Perhaps , with your assistance , I can remedy the situation . " Not if I can help it , Roberta thought fervently . She could barely imagine a worse scenario than Khan Noonien Singh adding teleportation to his arsenal . " You 've got the wrong girl , " she insisted . " I have no idea how the darn thing works . As far as I 'm concerned , it 's magic . " This was n't entirely true ; after nearly a quarter-century of broadcasting her atoms around the planet ( and elsewhere ) , she 'd learned her way around a transporter coil or two . There was no reason Khan needed to know that , though . With luck , a little old-fashioned sexism would add a veneer of plausibility to her protests . Girls never look under the hood , right ? Khan did not challenge her proclamations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was hardly off the hook . " Perhaps , then , your superior , the ever-manipulative Mr. Seven , will be willing to share his secrets  --  in exchange for your continued good health . " Stepping away from Roberta , apparently content to let his implied threat linger in her mind , Khan addressed Joaquin : " Put her in one of the holding cells on Level M-2 . I will interrogate her later , at my leisure . " Yippee , Roberta thought acidly . I can hardly wait . " But , Your Excellency ! " Joaquin blurted , looking chagrined at the prospect of leaving Khan unguarded . His basso profundo voice emanated from somewhere deep within his cavernous chest . The bear's-head belt buckle snarled silently . " Your safety ... " " Will not be endangered by your brief absence , " Khan assured him . He laid a fraternal hand on the bodyguard 's broad shoulder . " My friend , while I appreciate your devotion to duty , I am quite capable of defending myself , especially on my own island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow MacPherson . " Go . You shall find me in Mission Control , overseeing the next stage of today 's historic accomplishment . " Placated , Khan 's looming flunky grunted in assent and took hold of Roberta 's arm . " Hey , watch the grip ! " she yelped , unable to resist being pulled toward the stairs . " I 've still got bruises from the last time you manhandled me ! " Despite her loud objections , plus a great deal of squirming , Roberta paid close attention to her surroundings as Joaquin forcibly escorted her down several flights of stairs , into the lower regions of the former atomic test base . Sealed white doors , labeled in French , hid much from her view , but she took what mental notes she could on the facility 's layout and capacities .

Seven feared that Khan was deliberately trying to re-create the Chrysalis Project in order to duplicate his mother 's success at human genetic engineering . Just what we need , Roberta thought tartly . A second generation of Chrysalis kids . Like the first batch has n't been trouble enough .... Seven 's fears , not to mention hers , seemed confirmed when , precisely four floors beneath the sunlit rooftop , they passed what looked like a sturdy metal airlock , bearing the universal symbol for biohazardous material . Genetic Testing And Development , read the heavy block letters on the airlock 's exterior , printed in both English and Punjabi . authorized personnel only . Clearly , the signs had been posted after the French cleared out . Roberta could n't help wondering , and worrying , what sort of genes were being developed on the other side of the sealed metal door . Nothing warm and fuzzy , I bet . The sudden whoosh of air escaping from the doorway announced that someone was preparing to exit the bio-lab . Stalling in order to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own feet . " Oops ! " she declared , throwing out her free arm in hopes of breaking her fall , but Joaquin halted her clumsy descent by yanking hard on her other arm , nearly dislocating her shoulder . Unlike her stumble , the resulting cry of pain was totally sincere and spontaneous . " Up , " he grunted , easily pulling her back onto her feet with just one hand . Roberta felt like a side of beef hanging on a grumpy , unfeeling meat hook . " I 'm sorry , " she stammered , milking the moment for all it was worth . " I guess I 'm still a little woozy from that high-voltage hello your boss arranged for me . " A few feet away , the airlock door swung open , disgorging a statuesque Indian woman in a stained white lab coat . Clearly surprised by what she saw , the woman stared at Joaquin and his blond-haired captive with a baffled look on her face . She protectively clutched a three-inch floppy disk to her chest . " What is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An intruder , " Joaquin explained gruffly , while Roberta compared the woman 's well-made features to the photos in her own memory . Their eyes briefly met , and a shudder ran through Roberta as she saw the horizontal black lines bisecting both of the woman 's dark eyes . The inky streaks across her corneas were , Roberta knew , twin legacies of the disastrous chemical disaster in Bhopal , India , many years ago , created when the other woman had squinted to see her way through the clouds of poisonous gas . Seven and Khan were both at Bhopal , Roberta recalled , although they had managed to avoid being scarred in this manner . Numerous survivors , however , had been permanently marked , including one of the Chrysalis children . There could be no doubt : This was Dr. Phoolan Dhasal , a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist , who , like Khan , was also a product of Sarina Kaur 's illicit experiments back in the seventies . Roberta was familiar with Dhasal 's work , having once forced herself to wade through the precocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgenic exons during late-stage RNA processing . Dhasal had also been one of the youngest contributors to the Human Genome Project , before mysteriously disappearing several months ago ; her presence on Muroroa provided the final proof that Khan was up to hard-core genetic hanky-panky here in the South Seas . I need to report this to Seven , pronto . Joaquin did not prolong their chance encounter with Dhasal . Within moments , they had left the entrance to the bio-lab behind , descending even farther into the bowels of Khan 's new outpost . By Roberta 's calculations , they were well beneath the island 's surface , in some sort of sub-sub-basement , far from waving palms and fragrant trade winds . They finally stopped in front of a door marked Detention . Joaquin placed his sizable palm against a sensor plate mounted beside the door . A thick steel door slid open with a whoosh and they entered a stark white hallway lined on both sides with detention cells , perfect for confining , say , any pushy anti-nuke demonstrators who might have sneaked onto the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French to leave these for Khan , she thought somewhat less than sincerely . Bulletproof plastic doors , four inches thick and reinforced with thick metal struts , barred the entrance of each cell . Joaquin tugged open the door of the nearest cell and unceremoniously thrust Roberta inside . " Stay , " he ordered redundantly before locking the door back into place . To Roberta 's relief , he did not stay to keep her company , but quickly departed , no doubt anxious to resume his post watching over Khan . Thank my lucky stars , she thought . Rubbing her injured shoulder , she took a minute to inspect the latest stop on her Pacific excursion . The accommodations were spartan  --  a stool , a cot , a toilet  --  but clean and comfortable as jail cells go . Frankly , she 'd been imprisoned in worse places during her two decades-plus as an alien-sponsored secret agent babe . The first Chrysalis , she recalled , had not been equipped with detention facilities at all , so she and Seven had ended up locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , by contrast , was a definite step up . Not that she intended to stay all that long . Pressing her face against the transparent plastic door , she checked out the scene beyond her cell . As far as she could tell , she was currently the only prisoner . ( But not the first ; to her amusement , she noticed a Greenpeace logo carved into the seat of the wooden stool . ) There were no flesh-and-blood guards in sight , either , only security cameras mounted opposite every cell door , where no prisoner could reach them . " Hello ! Anybody there ? " No answer . Welcome to solitary confinement , she thought . Roberta languished in the cell for half an hour or so . Time enough , she lamented , for MacPherson and his staff to place Khan 's so-called Morning Star into a low polar orbit , where it could do the most harm . " No use crying over launched satellites , " she muttered , trying to maintain a positive attitude . Gary and I will just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way or another . Only because she was listening for them did Roberta hear the stealthy footprints in the corridor outside her cell . A low hum stirred the air and the unblinking red lights atop the security cameras went dead . Moments later , a solitary figure appeared on the other side of the thick plastic door . " About time you got here , " Roberta said .
