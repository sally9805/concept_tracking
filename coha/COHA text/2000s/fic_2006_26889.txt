Chapter One Sticky-Beak The flower fairies whirled around Jessie in a fluttering blur of pink , blue , green , purple , yellow , and white . Their bright wings brushed Jessie 's cheeks . Their tiny fingers tangled in her golden red hair . Their voices rang in her ears like crystal bells . " Do n't go , Jessie ! Queen Helena is in the west , and we 've got no one to dance with us . Stay in the Realm and dance with us , Jessie ! Oh , please , please , please ! " " Rose ! Bluebell ! Violet ! Daffodil ! Daisy ! Stop this ! " Jessie laughed . " I have to go back to my own world now . It 's Saturday , and Mum 's home . She 'll be wondering where I am . I 'll dance with you next time I visit , I promise . " " But that wo n't be for a long time ! " cried Daisy . " That 's what you said to Patrice the palace housekeeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse . " " You said you had to stay away from the Realm  --  because of a nasty old sticky-beak ! " added Bluebell . " Oh , you naughty fairies ! " Jessie exclaimed . " You were hiding ! You were listening ! " Bluebell and Violet hung their heads , but Daffodil , Daisy , and Rose giggled . " Yes , " said Daffodil , smoothing her yellow skirts . " We were hiding in the Ding Dong tree and we heard . What 's a sticky-beak , Jessie ? What , what , what ? " " Someone who pokes her nose into other people 's business ! " said Jessie , trying hard to sound stern . She faced the shadowy archway that marked the border of the Realm . " Open ! " she called . She closed her eyes as shadows surrounded her . Her skin prickled as the familiar cool , tingling breeze swept her away . Then , suddenly , everything grew still again . She could hear birds singing . The tangy scent of rosemary filled the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small square of smooth green grass . The grass was edged with rosemary bushes and surrounded by a high , clipped hedge . She was back in the place she called the secret garden . She was home . Quickly she checked to see that the door in the hedge was still shut and that the spade she 'd wedged against the old latch was still firmly in place . She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that everything was just as she 'd left it . No one had tried to enter the secret garden while she was away . Now all she had to do was get back to the house without  --  " Surprise ! " squealed five tiny voices . And there were the flower fairies , dancing in the air in front of her , their faces filled with glee . " We tricked you , Jessie ! " shrieked Daffodil . " We came with you ! " " Now you can dance with us here ! " squeaked Rose , dipping and twirling so that her frilly pink skirts billowed out around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I ca n't ! " said Jessie , hiding a smile . " I have to go up to the house . Mum will be  --  " Suddenly anxious , Jessie ran to the door in the hedge , opened it cautiously , and peered out . The Blue Moon garden was deserted except for the birds chattering in the trees . Her mother , Rosemary , was nowhere to be seen , and for once there was no sign of Louise Tweedie , their nosy next-door neighbor , either . Jessie breathed a sigh of relief . It had been a good idea to visit the Realm today  --  the day when the inside of Mrs. Tweedie 's house was going to be painted . She 'd hoped that Mrs. Tweedie would be too busy fussing around the painters to be bothered about Blue Moon , and it looked as if she 'd been right . Still . . . She turned back to the fairies . " You should go back to the Realm now , " she said . " Someone might see you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No one sees us , " she boasted , swinging on a stem of rosemary . " If they do , they think we 're flutterbyes . " " Flutterbyes , flutterbyes ! " Daffodil giggled , opening and closing her yellow wings . " They might think you 're butterflies at first , " Jessie argued . " But what if they look more closely ? What if  --  ? " " Your grandmother , our true Queen , likes it when we come to her garden to play , Jessie , " Bluebell said seriously . " And lately she has been making a new game  --  " " I see one ! " shrieked Rose . She darted under a rosemary bush , then fluttered back out onto the grass clutching something that looked like a tiny green-and-white-striped pillow . " Sweetie-pies ! " With squeals of excitement , the other fairies began flying around , searching for more hidden treats . " Quickly , quickly ! " squeaked Daffodil . " Find them all before the rainbow fairies come and find them first ! Emerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pink-striped , green-striped , purple-striped . . . " Jessie knew that there was no way she was going to make the fairies leave now . Frowning slightly , she closed the door in the hedge behind her and began walking up toward the house . For the first time in her life , she felt annoyed with her beloved grandmother . Why has Granny put treats for the fairies in the secret garden ? she thought crossly . Does n't she realize that it 's risky to encourage them to come here too often just now ? No , she does n't ! Jessie stopped suddenly as the thought struck her . Granny had lived at Blue Moon for over fifty years , ever since she had left her life as a princess of the Realm to marry Robert Belairs , the human man she loved . For all that time the Blue Moon garden had been safe for any fairy , pixie , or other magical creature who had cared to visit . But Granny had been away for two whole weeks , because the long-awaited exhibition of Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The real trouble had n't started till after she left . Granny did n't know just how much of a pest Mrs. Tweedie had become .
