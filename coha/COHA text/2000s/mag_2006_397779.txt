Their example and superb communications skills will give hope to the hundreds of patients who would otherwise die every year waiting for a donor 's heart . <p> Norman Rockwell sketched Rich in 1965 when the budding tycoon from Ada , Michigan , was growing his business and keeping his ever expanding population of friends healthy by promoting the all natural food supplement , Nutrilite . <p> After ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amway , which eventually bought out the Nutrilite company and added the food supplement to its line of products . <p> As vitamins were discovered , they were added to the Nutrilite base .

Is there any way to prevent this deformation from occurring at the joints ? Do copper bracelets help ? May Cliner Omaha , Nebraska <p> <p> If you want to avoid future surgery for arthritis in your wrist , you might want to try prophylactic therapy prevention with a copper bracelet . <p> Ting Moi , the Post 's talented photographer from Malaysia , tells us , " Many of the ' Grammies ' in my country wear copper bracelets . " <p> We know of no research studies to prove that copper helps prevent arthritis pain , but our mail tells us that it does . We heard via unverified sources that Father Hesburgh , 89 , of Notre Dame fame wears a copper bracelet . <p> We called the good Father Hesburgh to confirm . Our conversation follows : <p> " I 've heard by rumor that you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Is it true ? " <p> Hesburgh : " I 've used it copper bracelet for almost 50 years . It works . It 's just a simple copper bracelet  --  nothing fancy  --  that I wrap around my wrist . I knew my bracelet works because after 45 years at age 45 , I bad problems in the joints of my hand , shoulder , elbow , and wrist . An old friend of mine . Bob Goheen , president of Princeton University , had one of the copper bracelets on , and I asked if he had gone hippie . He said , ' My wife saw it in London and Paris . picked it up , and I put it on because I had to quit playing tennis . Now I 'm back playing tennis . ' <p> " I said . ' Get me one ! ' He did . and I put it copper bracelet on 50-odd years ago . After a couple of weeks , all the pain had gone from all my joints . <p> " I lost the bracelet 45 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would probably be okay , but three weeks later , I started getting the arthritis pain back in the joints . I got another copper bracelet , put it on . and bingo ! The pain was all taken care of . <p> " When I was on the Board of Directors of Chase Manhattan Bank , several other board members  --  including the head of a big department store , Federated Stores  --  wore one . We also had a guy John O'Connor on the board who was an old friend of mine from high school in Syracuse , New York Most Holy Rosary . He was interested when he saw three or four of the 20-some Board of Directors of Chase wearing copper bracelets . After he was through serving as Secretary of Commerce under President Johnson . he became head of Allied Chemical . He called a researcher in and said , ' I wish you would research copper ; these guys are not dummies they are very bright men  --  who all swear by the copper bracelets . Research it and tell me how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months later and said , ' Well , all we can tell you is that we 've looked at it worldwide , and that it does work . In fact , for years the women in India wore a kind of wire around their waist and none of them have arthritis , It 's just a common thing there . ' <p> " ' But when they checked it further , they found that it worked in half of the people , and the other half had no perceptible results . You ca n't manufacture and sell some thing that only works half the time . ' <p> " As far as we can find , it works half the time , but in those people , it 's a complete cure . It just takes away whatever is causing the pain . " <p> Father Hesburgh : " I 've used it for almost 50 years . It works . After a couple of weeks , all the pain had gone from all my joints . " <p> Dodging the Cancer Bullet <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . My two daughters have had it return for a second time . They both have had Mohs ' surgery and then reconstructive surgery . <p> We are hoping to find a topical product to help prevent recurrence . We were told prescription Retin-A might help , and I heard that zinc oxide or a tea cream could work , too . One more question : I read that a common ingredient in sunscreens is considered cancer-causing . Do you have any information on this ? Mary Ann Lamer Norman , Oklahoma <p> <p> We faxed your letter to leading dermatology researcher and surgeon Dr. C. William Hanke for his comment . Dr. Hanke replies : <p> " Sunscreens do not cause skin cancer . If used properly , these products will prevent many skin cancers from occurring . Zinc oxide is a common ingredient in sunscreens . <p> " Green tea and Retin-A would be of minimal benefit in preventing skin cancer . Dermatologists sometimes utilize topical imiquimod ( Aldara ) , topical 5 fluorouracil , or photodynamic therapy to destroy premalignant ceils , thereby reducing the chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common risk factors for skin cancer are fair skin ( which sunburns easily ) and a history of heavy sun exposure . Mohs ' micrographic surgery is indicated for selected skin cancers on the nose and other difficult locations . " <p> Dr. Hanke first published the term " Mohs ' micrographic surgery "  --  a procedure for the total removal of skin cancer that involves tissue mapping and microscopic examination to pinpoint the location of malignant ceils . The abbreviated term " Mohs ' surgery " is commonly used . A Better Beverage <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> Some of our friends insist that the ingredients in Diet Coke are worse for your health than those in regular ( " Classic " ) Coca-Cola . Is this true ? And would that be true of most diet drinks ? James Huston Lynchburg , Virginia <p> <p> Your friends are probably concerned about the aspartame that is added to some varieties of Diet Coke and other diet drinks . <p> Consuming aspartame ( brand name : Nutrasweet ) is dangerous for people with a genetic condition called phenylketonuria . Anecdotal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurological problems . In addition , data from a recent Italian study conducted on rats conflict with the FDA 's view that aspartame is safe . <p> " Classic " Coke is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup , an equivalent of nine teaspoons of sugar ( 140 calories ) in one 12-ounce can . Some people consume 20-ounce bottles of regular coke containing the equivalent of 15 teaspoons of sugar and 240 calories . High-fructose corn syrup  --  also found in many sports and juice drinks  --  is a common source of " empty " calories . In addition , both of the cokes you mention contain phosphoric acid , which can damage tooth enamel , and caffeine . which is a harmful drug for some of us . <p> We understand that some varieties of Diet Coke now contain Splenda . As we go to press , we are using Splenda , raw sugar , or honey in our Post kitchen . <p> Splenda seems too good to be true if all the accolades about it stand up in testing . <p> Instead of soft drinks , we try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter and out of sight . TABLE <p> Squeeze the juice from all the fruit . You will have about an 8-ounce cup of squeezed juice . Add water . Pour over crushed ice . Let guests sweeten with Splenda , honey , or raw sugar to taste . Add a festive straw . Serves 4 to 6 . <p> People taking Zocor and Lipitor should avoid grapefruit juice ; lime juice also inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme . Macular Degeneration <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> I have macular degeneration of both eyes . It has just begun and can barely be detected . <p> I read that drinking plenty of grape juice would help . And , according to an article in our local paper , a doctor from Florida says that it can be treated . <p> I eat plenty of green vegetables and fruits . I also take Ocuvite with lutein . <p> Is there anything else that you know can be done ? What causes this problem ? A concerned reader Robertsdale , Alabama <p> <p> Treatments do exist and research offers hope for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow : <p> " Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) is the leading cause of irreversible visual loss in the industrialized world . The cause is unknown , but genetic and nutritional factors play a role . <p> " Within the past decade , researchers have introduced many promising treatment and prevention options in an at tempt to minimize central vision loss due to AMD . <p> " For the nonexudative ( dry ) form , a specially formulated combination of the antioxidants vitamin C , vitamin E , and beta carotene , copper , and zinc is the one widely accepted preventative agent , based on the results of a large randomized prospective multicenter study called the Age-Related Eye Disease Study ( AREDS ) . <p> " For the exudative ( wet ) form , current proven treatments include thermal laser photocoagulation , verteporfin photo dynamic therapy , and Macugen injections . <p> " However , many pharmacologic interventions are in all phases of clinical development and expected to change the entire approach to AMD management in the near future . " <p> Early diagnosis is key . See page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amsler grid . Nutrition Facts About Gluten-Free Bread <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas . <p> I just love your " Medical Mailbox . " In the Jan. /Feb. issue on page 105 , there is a recipe for gluten-free bread . Would it be possible to publish its calorie , protein , carbohydrate , fat , fiber , and sodium content ? I 'm diabetic and this recipe sounds very good for me . I use sugar substitute in all I bake , so that 's no problem . I have never made anything with rice or soy flour . Pauline Dumont Auburn . Maine <p> <p> Our dietician . Patti Olson , calculated the following nutritional values for one slice of the bread ( 1/15 of a loaf ) made with sugar and full-fat soy flour . TABLE The ABCs of Diverticulosis <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> I have enjoyed your column for many years . I know you have written about diverticulosis in the past , but I no longer have the articles . Now that I have been diagnosed with the problem , I would appreciate any information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been blessed with good health . Thank you very much . Ruth Stanley Grand Bay . Alabama <p> <p> For your diverticulosis , we recommend increasing the fiber in your diet . <p> Kellogg 's All Bran has been a staple in our Post kitchens since 1975. when we traveled in Africa and met DE Denis Burkitt . We 're proud of our seminal article that details his visions of preventing a multitude of diseases with a fiber filled diet . All his predictions are coming to pass . <p> Our September 1975 Post profiled his discovery of Burkitt 's lymphoma , the first cancer known to be caused by a virus . He was an impassioned fiber missionary who considered his fiber discovery to be the most important accomplishment of his life . You may order a copy of the article from Nancy in Post Archives . <p> We asked Dr. Gregory Blitz , a prominent gastroenterologist. to answer your letter . His comments follow : <p> " Diverticula are small pockets , or " outpouchings ' from the colon wall . They generally occur on the left side o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tend to first develop when people reach their 40s and 50s . <p> " No specific treatment or surgery is necessary for most people . In general , we recommend a high-fiber diet and avoidance of constipation . Using a fiber-type product such as Metamucil is often helpful . Diverticulosis is often diagnosed during a colonoscopy or barium enema . There is no specific follow-up for diverticulosis . " <p> Your Post editor believes one should have a first colonoscopy no later than age 40 . If you do n't think that 's important , ask Katie Couric , whose husband was diagnosed with a late-stage fatal colon cancer in his early 40s . <p> Dr. Denis Burkitt was a fiber diet visionary . <p> " Crossed " Eye May Improve on Its Own <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> I had something happen to my right eye in October 2005 that caused me to see double . My right eye is turned toward my nose . A specialist recommended I have a prism put on my right lens . It has helped quite a bit , but here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will it get better ? I take medicine for blood pressure and thyroid plus calcium and baby aspirin . Frances Thompson Hudson , New York <p> <p> An inward deviation of the eyeball caused by an unequal pulling of the muscles that move the eyes is called esotropia . This is one type of eye muscle disorder , or strabismus . <p> We sent your letter to Dr. David A. Plager , professor of ophthalmology and director of the section of pediatric ophthalmology and adult strabismus at Indiana University Medical Center . Dr. Plager replies : <p> " There arc many causes for sudden onset of double vision . However , in the clinical setting described here , the most likely cause In an older man with high blood pressure is a partial paralysis of the sixth cranial nerve ( CN VI , the abducent nerve ) . <p> " This nerve is one of three cranial nerves that control eye movements . It innervates the lateral rectus muscle , which is responsible for rotating the right eye into right gaze . Damage or injury to CN VI will weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the left  --  resulting in a " crossed eye . " Vascular disorders such as high blood pressure or diabetes are the most common causes for this condition , though trauma , infections and tumors can also be associated . <p> " If the sixth nerve paresis is unrelated to other illnesses or neurologic symptoms , most ophthalmologists recommend an observation period of weeks to months . Fortunately , most paresis due to vascular causes such as high blood pressure will improve on its own over several months . prisms in glasses can be of some help . particularly if the palsy is mild . although this usually does not affect a permanent cure . Some doctors consider injection of botulinum toxin ( Botox ) into a muscle to counterbalance the weak muscle during the recovery period , but this probably does not alter the ultimate outcome . <p> " If the nerve damage is more extensive and does not resolve within six to 12 months , then eye muscle surgery can help restore a normal eye alignment and resolve the double vision . " <p> There are 12 pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the opening at the base of the skull . In addition to the three cranial nerves mentioned by Dr. Plager , other cranial nerves with which you are probably familiar include the 1st , or olfactory , nerve for smell , the 2nd. or optic nerve , for sight , and the 5th , or trigeminal , nerve for facial movements . Grandson Faces Uncertain Future <p> Dear Dr. SerVaas , <p> Our 19-year-old grandson was diagnosed with myotonic muscular dystrophy . At six foot , two inches , and a lifelong perfect specimen of health , he was sent home with an uncertain future and little hope . <p> After reading your articles , we thought you might give us more information on the disease , on help that is available now , and re . search to watch for in the future . Raymond Lloyd Richland , Washington <p> <p> Thank you for writing . Please do n't despair . We encourage you to read Dr. Jerome Groopman 's article on page 68 . He writes from firsthand experience about the power of hope and its healing effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a clinic run by the Muscular Dystrophy Association ? A spokesperson for that association told us that this is a good way for patients and their families to get the help  --  and hope  --  that they need . <p> Gene researchers know that my tonic dystrophy is linked to a defect on chromosome 19 . Pinpointing the specific location may someday lead to new treatments and even a cure . <p> In general , myotonic dystrophy results in muscle weakness accompanied by delayed muscle relaxation . It is the most common adult form of MD . Troublesome symptoms of the disease , also known as Steinert 's disease and dystrophic myotonica , may include eye problems and an inability to release the hand from a grip . <p> As you mention , the course of the disease is unpredictable . Muscles of the face , neck , hands , forearms and feet are usually the first to be affected . Medications can help improve muscle function , and related problems  --  if they exist in the heart and other tissues and organs  --  can also be treated , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log on to www.mdausa.org/locate . <p> Readers may send their letters to Medical Mailbox , 1100 Waterway Blvd. , Indianapolis , IN. 46202 or to **38;1169;TOOLONG .
