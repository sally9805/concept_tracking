<p> THE RIGHT BAIT <p> SCOUTING PAYS OFF WHEN MARLINS DEAL <p> Dusty Baker is right : The Marlins do have a lot of other team 's top prospects . But maybe there 's a reason for that . They do their homework . <p> The Marlins could have asked for any of the Cubs ' top pitching prospects when the Cubs were seeking Juan Pierre last year . They held out for Ricky Nolasco ( below ) because they scouted him well . At Class AA West Tenn last year , Nolasco faced the Marlins ' Class AA Carolina Mudcats three times . In 20 innings , <p> Nolasco allowed two runs on 14 hits , with 10 walks and 26 strikeouts . The Marlins ' scouts were paying attention . <p> " When guys do well against you , sometimes your manager falls in love with them , " one minor-league insider said . <p> " Whenever you 're trading a guy like Juan Pierre , you 're looking for quality players in return , " said Brian Chattin , the Marlins ' director of player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the way he went about his business on the mound , he looked like someone who could be successful in the big leagues down the road . " <p> Nolasco made the Marlins out of spring training . He 's 11-7 with a 4.12 ERA . In his last six starts , he 's 5-1 with a 2.41 ERA and 29 hits allowed in 37 innings . <p> The Marlins deserve credit for selling high and buying low . They acquired right-hander Anibal Sanchez ( 4-0 , 1.42 ERA in five starts ) and shortstop Hanley Ramirez ( .265 , 11 HR , 36 RBI ) from the Red Sox for Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell . They picked up Mike Jacobs ( .270 , 15 HR , 59 RBI ) from the Mets for Carlos Delgado . <p> " The only thing I can say is that we let our scouts and player development personnel work , " Chattin said . " We have a lot of faith in them and the personnel we have , and we let them do their work on their players . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUMP-START ON NEXT YEAR <p> CUBS ' BEST BET : KEEP THE ROOKIES PITCHING <p> OK , so the Cubs have a Ryan O'Malley . But do they have a Justin Verlander ? A Josh Johnson ? Or , heaven forbid , a Francisco Liriano ? <p> For all the rookie pitchers Dusty Baker has thrown out there this season , the question remains : Do the Cubs have anything to hang their hats on ? Sean Marshall was more effective than not early , but he 's hurt . Rich Hill has been better lately , but he 's still 2-5 with a 7.23 ERA as a starter . Carlos Marmol has had 12 starts , four of them good , eight of them not so good . Like everybody else , he has a long way to go . <p> If there 's any point to the remainder of a dreadful season , it 's to keep trotting these guys out there to see if one of them can learn from their mistakes and become a pitcher . They can start by throwing strikes . Does Larry Rothschild know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cubs have started , they are n't in a class with the Marlins ( Johnson , Scott Olsen , ex-Cub farmhand Ricky Nolasco and Anibal Sanchez , who might be the best of them all ) or the Angels ( Jered Weaver and Joe Saunders are a combined 12-0 ) or the Tigers ( Verlander , Zach Miner to go with setup man Joel Zumaya ) . <p> But with O'Malley 's outstanding performance in a 1-0 victory over the Astros on Wednesday  --  eight scoreless innings , four hits  --  the Cubs ' rookies are on a roll . Including Juan Mateo 's victory against the Astros on Tuesday night , Cubs rookie pitchers have allowed two earned runs and 11 hits over the last 18 innings ( a 1.00 ERA ) . <p> That 's only two games , and against the worst-hitting team in the National League ( the Astros are batting .257 ) , but considering the rookie starters are 14-21 with a 5.88 ERA this year , it 's the best thing the Cubs have going . <p> And the way things are developing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to step up soon . <p> CUBS ROOKIE STARTERS <p> Player Starts W-L ERA IP WHIP BAA <p> Juan Mateo ( R ) 2 1-0 3.60 10 1.40 .270 <p> Sean Marshall ( L ) 19 5-8 4.98 103 1.45 .262 <p> Carlos Marmol ( R ) 12 5-5 5.85 65.2 1.68 .236 <p> Angel Guzman ( R ) 5 0-3 9.15 21.2 2.17 .349 <p> Rich Hill ( L ) 8 2-5 7.23 42.1 1.70 .291 <p> Ryan O'Malley ( R ) 1 1-0 0.00 8.0 1.38 .172 <p> Jae Kuk Ryu ( R ) 1 0-0 40.50 1.1 5.25 .636 <p> Totals 48 14-21 5.88 251 1.63 .270 <p> MARLINS ROOKIE STARTERS <p> Player Starts W-L ERA IP WHIP BAA <p> Josh Johnson ( R ) 18 10-6 2.56 109 1.28 .232 <p> Scott Olsen ( L ) 22 9-6 4.19 127.2 1.01 .242 <p> Ricky Nolasco ( R ) 16 9-6 4.11 92 1.29 .271 <p> Anibal Sanchez ( R ) 9 4-2 2.83 54 1.20 .214 <p> Yusmeiro Petit ( R ) 1 0-1 7.50 6 1.83 .440 <p> Totals 66 32-21 3.56 389 1.19 .246 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batting average against <p> All statistics as starting pitcher only <p> SHOTS IN DARK <p> SECRET SERVICE ARRESTS BAXTER ON GUNS CHARGES <p> Former Bull Lonny Baxter has learned the hard way  --  nothing good happens at 2:30 in the morning . <p> Baxter and another man were arrested by Secret Service agents in Washington after police said shots were fired from their vehicle , about two blocks from the White House . <p> Baxter , who played for the Charlotte Bobcats last season , was taken into custody around 2:30 a.m. after a witness flagged down a Secret Service agent and reported shots fired from his white sport utility vehicle , Secret Service spokesman Eric Zahren told the Associated Press . <p> Officers recovered a handgun from the SUV . <p> " There were spent shell casings in plain view inside the vehicle , " Zahren told the AP . <p> Baxter , 27 , and passenger Irvin Martin , 35 , were charged with carrying a pistol without a license and other firearms charges .

It was his 45th home run since turning 40 . <p> " Had to put a word in for the old troops tonight , " Fisk said . " For the older crew . " <p> The Sox lost the opener 1-0 in 13 innings as the Rangers ' 43-year-old Nolan Ryan pitched 10 scoreless innings against the Sox ' Greg Hibbard . <p> Fisk finished his career with 376 career home runs , 351 as a catcher . Mike Piazza broke his record in 2004 . <p> Fisk also holds the major-league record for games caught ( 2,226 ) . He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2000 . <p> PARDON THE DIATRIBE <p> KORNHEISER TEES OFF ON CRITICS <p> Tony Kornheiser , of all people , should know by now : If you can dish it out , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Post sports columnist and co-host of ESPN 's " Pardon The Interruption " lashed out at critics of his " Monday Night Football " debut in an interview Tuesday with Dan Patrick on ESPN-1000 . <p> " I apparently got ripped in my own newspaper , by a two-bit weasel slug named Paul Farhi , who I would gladly run over with a Mack truck given the opportunity , " Kornheiser told Patrick . <p> " I understand I 'm a public figure and I 'm subject to review , but I thought my own newspaper would be kinder , and I would n't be backstabbed by this guy . " <p> Kornheiser also took on another " teammate , " ESPN radio 's Mike Golic , who apparently was unimpressed by Kornheiser 's debut . <p> " I heard Golic rip me and say my performance was nothing . Was n't bad . Was n't good . Did n't mean anything to him . Did n't shake his world . I wanted to ring his neck and hang Golic over the back of a shower rod like a duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the job . I guess he thinks he should have gotten it . " <p> While it 's silly to make any substantive review of Kornheiser 's performance after one preseason game , Kornheiser should know it 's the way of the sports world . Every play , every set of downs , every quarter , every game , no matter how insignificant , is a defining moment . Either Kornheiser was drumming up more <p> interest in " Monday Night Football , " " PTI " and/or Tony Kornheiser , or he is not a Ready for Prime Time Player . <p> A NEW STADIUM , BY GEORGE <p> SAY GOODBYE TO A SLICE OF BIG APPLE HISTORY <p> The House That Ruth Built might better be known as " The House that Steinbrenner Destroyed . " <p> Yankee Stadium , what many of us baseball purists consider a crown jewel of American sports  --  despite a 1976 renovation , it 's still a place where Ruth and Gehrig walked  --  is doomed to meet the wrecking ball . <p> Ground was broken on a new Yankee Stadium on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  across the street from the current Stadium in the Bronx . <p> The $800 million , 51,000-seat stadium will include all the amenities of today 's modern stadiums and provide owner George Steinbrenner with a way to recoup some of the nearly $1 billion he has spent over the last five seasons with nary a World Series title . <p> The new stadium is expected to be ready for the 2009 season . The old Stadium will be history . <p> " Yeah , I 'll miss it some , " Steinbrenner told the New York Post as he arrived at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night . <p> But not that much . <p> " I do like the other idea much better , " he said . " And it 's much better for the fans , too . " <p> Not everybody thinks so . In one Internet poll , 35 percent of the voters said the old Stadium should stay . <p> Newsday columnist Wallace Matthews called it big money grab by Steinbrenner . " This deal is as dirty as anything ever found in a puddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It would be nice if Steinbrenner at least allowed the new place to be called " Yankee Stadium , " but chances are naming rights will be sold . Resigned to that fate , Matthews offered a suggestion : <p> Fort Knox at Yankee Stadium . <p> Sounds about right .
