In the town of Winfield , Ala. , where everybody knows everybody and flags have flown proudly since Sept. 11 , folks remember Johnny Micheal Spann as a polite kid who studied hard , played football for the Winfield High Pirates and did n't draw attention to himself . But there was one secret he would share with anyone who would listen . As football practice began one day , his coach , Joe Hubbert , asked him , " What do you want to be in your life ? " " I want to be involved in the FBI or CIA , " Hubbert recalls the teenager 's telling him intently . " That 's my goal . " <P> Mike Spann realized his dream . After a stint as a Marine Corps artillery officer , Spann joined the CIA two years ago . Last October the rookie covert officer packed off to Afghanistan , where he roamed the country in Afghan garb . In a prison near Mazar-i-Sharif , the adventure ended tragically when Spann , 32 , and a colleague identified only as " Dave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed . <P> He was " an American hero , " proclaimed CIA Director George Tenet , who enraged some agency graybeards by revealing the identity of not only the spy but also his family . The CIA , which is under fire for failing to anticipate the Sept. 11 attacks , had publicly named only 43 of the 78 other officers who have died in the line of duty . Tenet , however , decided to acknowledge Spann 's death after press reports circulated that a CIA agent had died . <P> Spann was part of a secretive paramilitary unit of the CIA , a special-operations group of several hundred covert commandos skilled in sabotage , collecting intelligence in war zones and training foreign guerrillas . During the Vietnam War , the CIA had as many as 500 paramilitary officers organizing counterguerrilla operations in Southeast Asia . But after Vietnam and the scandals of the 1970s , when the agency was accused of being involved in torture and assassinations , the paramilitary force was practically disbanded . Traditional CIA intelligence officers , who prowled diplomatic cocktail circuits and hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining " knuckle draggers , " as they derisively called the SOG operatives . When the agency needed paramilitary experts for its covert operations against the Soviets in Afghanistan or for training contra rebels in Nicaragua in the 1980s , it borrowed Army Green Berets or Navy SEALs or hired retired commandos on contract . <P> In the past two years , however , Tenet has enlarged the CIA 's paramilitary force . The SOG is divided into ground , maritime and air branches that have light arms , surveillance gear , riverboats and small planes . And since Sept. 11 , intelligence sources tell TIME , the agency has been on a hiring binge and has spent tens of millions of dollars on extra hardware . More than a hundred CIA operatives are now in Afghanistan , collecting intelligence on Osama bin Laden and urging warlords to turn against the Taliban . For the worldwide war against terrorism , " the CIA is practically creating its own army , navy and air force , " says an intelligence source .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
