Like anyone else with a telephone , Gail Connor had received her share of crank calls , but none where the person on the other end had disguised his voice , called her a bitch , and said she was going to die . The night she received such a call , it was more annoying than frightening . At thirty-four , trained as a litigating attorney , she was not the sort of woman to be easily rattled . And she thought she knew who had done itthe kid across the street . He was fourteen , and earlier she had yelled at him to stay out of her backyard . He 'd been smoking in the gazebo . Even worse , Karen and two of her friends had been out there with him , and Karen was still under eleven years old . Later on that night , Gail wondered if her temper might have been the result of so many changes in so short a time . Divorcing one man , falling in love with another . Giving up a partnership to open her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making her crazy . She and Karen had lived in it less than a month . They were not used to high-beamed ceilings and heavy plaster walls , to narrow stairs that twisted to a second floor , or to an immense gas stove that hissed , then popped into flame . The toilets gurgled ; the air conditioner wheezed . Warped windows stuck halfway open . Gail would have to go outside and shove while Karen jiggled the crank . During heavy rains they put towels on the sills . Gail told Karen they were having an adventure . Karen crossed her arms and rolled her eyes . Gail 's mother had warned against uprooting the child so abruptly from her old neighborhood . Gail could see the pointin hindsightbutdid n't know what could be done about it now . To make Karen feel better , she had allowed her to bring home a kitten from the animal shelter , a little black-and-white female named Missy . So far the creature had thrown up twice on Gail 's bedroom rug and peed on one of Anthony 's best jackets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home freshly painted and patched , with a new kitchen and refinished oak floors . Karen would get to design her own bedroom . But the week after Gail put their old house on the market , expecting to have months till the closing , a Brazilian couple offered full priceif they could close right away . Not wanting to lose the deal , Gail called a moving company and had all her and Karen 's belongings hauled from their modern three-two in South Miami to the 1927 coral rock and stucco relic in Coconut Grove , where air plants sprouted from the leaky tile roof and the bushes had not been pruned in decades . She had assumed it would take only two or three weeks , with little disruption to her schedule . She had been wrong . The workers , few of whom spoke English , showed up when they showed up , and charged extortionate rates for off hours . The painting could n't be done until the carpenter was finished and the carpenter had to wait for the plumber . The wedding was only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their honeymoon , Anthony sweeping her into his arms , stepping over the threshold . They plunge between the open floor joists . The night Gail received the telephone call wishing her dead was a Thursday , the middle of June . Officially Anthony was still living in his town house on Key Biscayne , fifteen miles away , but he would often come by after work . On this particular night he had stopped by a gourmet grocery . He opened the aluminum takeout pan and showed it to Karen , who was sitting backward in a kitchen chair with her chin on crossed arms . " Look . Lasagna . " " Yuck . " " Qu pasa , mamita ? " " I hate mushrooms . " " Karen ! " Gail turned around with a hand on her hip . " If you ca n't be polite , then go upstairs until you can . " " Fine . I 'll starve to death . " Gail called out to her retreating back . " And take a bath . I 'll come check on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be dead . " Karen scooped up her kitten , which was playing with a toy lizard under the table . Heavy-soled sneakers thudded up the stairs , and a few seconds later a door slammed . " Sorry about that , " Gail said . She jerked on a drawer to free it , then scooped silverware out of the tray . The cabinets were fake walnut , and the appliances were avocado green . It would all go during remodelingif they could ever decide what to put in its place . She gave the silverware to Anthonythree sets in case Karen repented . He was still frowning at the empty archway that led to the hall , which seconds before had contained a skinny girl with long brown hair and jeans so baggy they dragged on the floor . " What 's the matter with Karen ? Is she mad at me for a reason that I fail to grasp ? " " No , it 's me . I told her she could n't go outside and playexcuse me , go hang outwith Jennifer and Lindsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He glanced at the ceiling . A stereo had come on , playing just below the volume at which someone might go upstairs and ask that it be turned down . " Just ignore her , " Gail said . " She 's almost eleven , and I 've heard that girls go through this when they hit puberty . It 's a natural phase of development . Supposedly . " Half to himself , Anthony muttered , " Ah , yes . The obnoxious phase . " Gail made a little face at him , then put the lasagna in the oven to warm and went about making the salad . Rip open a plastic bag of mixed baby greens , throw in a few walnuts , some cherry tomatoes , and crumbled Gorgonzola . Toss with bottled vinaigrettenot the cheap kind , the five-dollar brand from Chef Alan . She and every woman lawyer she knew had a repertoire of recipes that could produce a meal in ten minutes flat . It helped if somebody else brought the main course . Anthony had taken two glasses from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Just wine . Anything stronger will put me to sleep , and I have a case to work on . " Her wineglasses were lost in the boxes stacked in the living room . He poured white wine into one short glass and dark rum over ice into another . " I would have gone over the file at my office , but the handyman called . It cost me a hundred dollars , but at least he fixed the sink . There was a cat toy stuck in the drain , do n't ask me how . " Anthony touched the rim of his glass to hers . " Salud . " She gratefully took a swallow and leaned over to give him a quick kiss . " Thanks . And hello , mi cielo , whom I have n't seen in two days . I wonder . Is your secretary telling the truth when she says she ca n't reach you ? Why am I always the one to let the repairmen in ? " " Well , you live here . " Anthony leaned against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had gracefully masculine hands . There was a ring on his last fingergarnet set in gold . " That is not the right answer . " Gail pulled on his loosened tie . Patterned red silk , which matched the ring , which went with the monogrammed initials on the pocket of his custom-made shirt . " I bet you do n't even know what a P-trap is , do you ? " " Of course . I keep them in my nightstand . " She narrowed her eyes . " Hopeless . " He set down his drink and kissed her . His soft , full mouth was cool from the ice , tangy-sweet from alcohol . Both hands went under her shirt to caress bare skin . She had not worn a bra . He quickly discovered that fact and pinned her against the counter . Stopping to catch her breath , she said , " Stay tonight . Say yes . " She left a trail of light kisses across his cheek . " Yes . Yes . I promise you many exotic delights ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with Karen in her phaseI 'll stay if you want , but is it wise ? " " Probably not . You make me very unwise . I 'm crazy about you . Absolutely wacko . " He curled her fingers over his hand and kissed them . The movement made her engagement ring sparkle , even in the kitchen 's buzzing fluorescent light . The stone was perfect , a man 's diamond he had worn on his own hand , reset for her . His eyes lifted to focus on hers . " Gail , are you going to tell me what happened in court today or not ? " Since morning that topic had been in and out of her consciousness like an intermittent toothache . She reached for her wine . " The judge is going to appoint a psychologist to interview Karen . I have n't told her about it yet . " " What do you mean , a psychologist ? The motion was about visitation . " " Yes , well , they raised the issue anyway , after the judge said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . They said I 've made Karen afraid to admit she wants to live with her father . Afraid ? What in God 's name do they think I do , beat her ? What really galls me is that Dave does n't consider how this is affecting Karen . Never mind what she 's going through , he wants to get back at me . Our marriage failed , and it 's all my fault , but I got the house and the kid . Well , excuse me . It was Dave who wanted out . Then he took off on his damned sailboat for six months . Lived with some girl in San Juan . He hardly ever wrote Karen . I ca n't tell you the times she cried over him and I had to make up some story . Yes , sweetie , of course your daddy loves you , but there 's no post office on the islands . ' And now he 's back and I 'm such a bad mother they need a psychologist to determine the extent of the damage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sorry for ranting . " She could feel the heat building from Anthony 's direction . " Come on . This is n't about you . Dave is angry with me . You 're just bonus points . " A lift of Anthony 's brows said he doubted that . " Karen is old enough to decide where she wants to live , do n't you think ? Why does n't the judge leave it up to her ? " " Karen wo n't make a decision . She does n't want to hurt either of us , so she wo n't say anything . " " You have n't asked ? " " I 'd rather not put pressure on her . " " Gail , she 's not a baby . You should take another look . A girl is better off with a mother , who can tell her about " Anthony looked for the word " feminine things . She can visit her father when she likes , but her home is with you . Be as subtle as you need to , but make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . " " Maybe you 're right , but I really do n't want to talk about it anymore . " Gail grabbed a towel to take the lasagna out of the oven . Maneuvering it past the door , she grazed her knuckle on the hot metal . " Ouch . Dammit ! " The door slammed shut with a clatter of oven racks . She dropped the aluminum pan on the table and waved her hand to shake off the burn . " Are you okay ? " " It 's nothing . " She looked down at the pan . " I should have put the lasagna in a nicer dish . As if I could find one in that chaos in the garage . " Gail let out a long breath , then noticed the folder Anthony had laid on the end of the table when he 'd come in . " What 's in there ? The architect 's drawings ? " " I thought we could look at them over dinner , " he said . Away from the tourist-clogged section , streets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets with odd names like Ye Little Wood , Battersea , and Kiaora . The land could rise and fall , as this part of Miami had some altitudefifteen feet above sea level . One might see a starkly modern house of angled glass and concrete beside a run-down clapboard cottage . The next would be hidden behind a wood fence laden with hot pink bougainvillea . A rainbow flag might fly from one roof , Old Glory from another . At this time of year plants thrust upward and out , blocking the light , climbing over each other , bursting with buds , tendrils , fronds , and leaves the size of dinner plates . Clematis Street was a cul-de-sac running along a canal that led to Biscayne Bay . The dozen or so homes were generally of a Mediterranean design , with a few tropical moderns and one white-columned colonial out of its latitude . Gail and Anthony 's house was constructed of block and stucco , with a circular drive and covered terraces front and back , tiled to feel cool in the summer . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom , for those days in winter when one might want the glow of a fire . The real estate saleslady had used the words charming and cozy . As Anthony laid the drawings out on the tablepen and ink with washes of colorGail wondered if the architect had looked at the right house . It was evident he had gone far beyond plans for a kitchen . The long , narrow living room had doubled in size . The side wall had been pushed out twenty feet , and a massive brass chandelier hung from the ceiling . The stairs , which had been torn out and moved across the room , curved to form a balcony that looked down from the second floor . Gail laid her fork carefully on her plate . Anthony showed her a drawing of the new master bedroom . " Here 's a view of the upper-floor terrace from our room . It 's completely private . Karen 's room and the other two bedrooms would have balconies . The guest house would be next to the pool , separate or connected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool ? " As if finally aware of what he was showing her , Anthony shuffled through the sketches . " Well , the architect thought it would add value to the house . You do n't want a pool ? " " But we were only going to redo the kitchen and make some minor repairs , not redesign the entire house . We do n't have time for major renovation right now . " " That 's what contractors are for . " " But somebody has to be here to deal with these people . Not you . I get to do it because I live here . " " I do not want to live in this house the way it is , and it is betterin my opinionto do it now , to get it over with " " Anthony , let 's just get the kitchen done . " " Why are you being so negative ? " " I 'm not negative , this is insane ! " Gail sat back in her chair . " How much would it cost ? Ballpark figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two-fifty . Three hundred . " " At least . " She propped her chin in her palm . " I hate to tell you , but I 've got that old Hawaiian diseaselackamoola . " When Anthony went blank , she repeated , " Lackamoola . Lack of " " Okay , I get it . " " Miriam 's been asking for a raise , the computers are costing a fortune , and I 'm afraid to spend money right now . " He scooted his chair out and reached for her hand . " Sweetheart , listen to me . It was my decision to hire the architect , and the changesthose over our budgetI 'll take care of them . You do n't have to match every dollar I put into the house . I do n't expect you to . " " But I want to . " " Why ? " " Because ... I just do . " His laugh was an exhalation of disbelief . " What are you trying to prove ? " " I am not trying to prove anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars ... " He spun a drawing to the table . " Maybe we should n't have bought this house . Maybe we should find something else . " " Well , you know , I ca n't say it has n't crossed my mind a few times as I waited around for someone to come fix the roof . " " Is that what you want ? All right . Okay , vamos a venderla . I 'll call a realtor tomorrow . " " Another of your typically extreme responses " Above the whir and hum of the air conditioneralways on this time of yearGail heard a high-pitched noise . It took her a few seconds to realize it was a scream , and that it was n't a sound effect on one of Karen 's CDs . She leaped up . " What was that ? " Anthony asked . " Karen ! " He automatically glanced upward , then raced for the stairs . Gail heard it againcloser , and coming from the backyard . She ran through the kitchen and onto the terrace , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light on the water . Karen came hurtling out of the darkness , another girl closely behind , legs pounding . Gail ran across the terrace , nearly tripping on a broken tile . A third girl followed more slowly . " Come on , guys . He was just kidding . " Fists clenched , Karen whirled around . The friend with her giggled , breathless with excitement . Gail reached for Karen to make sure she was all right , then moved to stand in front of her , guarding her from whatever might be out there . The gazebo was a crisscross of pale lines , and a small orange dota cigaretteflew into the shadows . " Who 's there ? " The third girl slowed . " It 's my brother . He did n't mean anything . " A boy sauntered down the steps . Gail could see only a slender frame and blond curls . His voice carried easily on the heavy , humid air . " My mom sent me to find Lindsay . " Gail glared at him , the same kid who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother 's motorcycle . " Go home , Payton . Now . And stay off this property . " He shouted back at her , " I was n't doing anything . Do n't get so hyper . " " I said go home ! Do you want me to call your parents ? " " Go ahead . " Karen screamed , " Payton , you asshole ! " Gail grabbed her upper arm . " Do n't talk like that ! " " Owww ! " " I 'm not hurting you . " She came closer and sniffed Karen 's hair . " What were you doing out there ? Smoking ? " She shook her . " Answer me . " The boy vanished into the bushes , and his sister fled after him . " I was n't ! " Karen tried to twist out of Gail 's grip , but slipped and fell on her backside . The girl beside her quickly moved away . This was a chubby little brunette whose tight shirt showed it was time for a bra . Karen started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The back door banged open , slamming against the wall . Anthony appeared . " Qu en el demonio ? " " Jennifer ! " A woman stood at the edge of the house . Gail recognized herMrs . Cabrera , Jennifer 's mother . They lived a few doors down . With some urgency she called out , " Jennifer , ven aca . Time to come home . Right now . " Gripping Karen 's arm , Gail pulled her to her feet . With Mrs. Cabrera 's accusatory eyes on her , she hurried to explain . " They were in the gazebo with friends . I do n't know what was going on . " " Nothing ! " yelled Karen . " Mom , let me go ! " Jennifer made a guilty little wave at Karen . " See ya . " Mrs. Cabrera shot another look at the three of them , then bustled her daughter away with a terse " Good night . " Gail took Karen into the kitchen . " You . Go to your room and get ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going to talk . " She turned Karen toward the stairs and gave her a little shove to send her off . Anthony closed the back door and locked it . " What was that about ? " " You tell me . They were out there with Payton Cunningham , who was smoking . I 'd like to know how many cigarette butts I find down there tomorrow , and God help them if I find anything else . Payton is fourteen , a budding juvenile delinquent who dug tire tracks in the yard last week . " With a little moan Gail brushed her hair off her forehead . " Welcome to family life . " " I know . I have kids . " " Yes , but yours are comfortably away in New Jersey . " Gail noticed the drawings on the table . " I need to see about Karen . Could we talk about the house later ? Not tonight . I really have to get to work . You can stay if you want . " " No . " As if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrace , then back at Gail . " You let her get away with too much . " " Let her ? I did n't let her go outside " " But she did , and why did she assume she could get away with it ? When I 'm living here , that behavior is going to change . " " Really . Well , good luck . " He was gone in less than five minutes . She watched his car pull out of the driveway . Red taillights flared , then grew smaller up the street . His kiss had been more polite than affectionate . Gail locked the door , then leaned on it . The lamp on her glass-topped table did little to illuminate the living room . Her furniture looked ridiculous , all modern white sofas and chairs and light wood . In her head the words she had bit her tongue not to say were whirling around : Yes , let 's sell the damn thing . I 'm sorry we bought it . Twenty-five-watt bulbs in pitted , brass-colored sconces lit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowing to rip them off with a crowbar at the earliest opportunity . No sound came from Karen 's room . Gail tried the door . " Karen ? Let me in . " When there was no response , Gail smacked her palm on the varnished wood panel . " Karen ! Open this door . " The lock clicked . Karen was in her pajamas and the light was off . She yawned widely . " I was asleep . " " You were not . " Gail flipped the switch , and the desk lamp went on . " Do n't ever lock your door like that . " " You lock yours . " Retreating to her bed , Karen drew up her legs and hugged them with thin arms . " When Anthony is here , you lock your door , so why ca n't I lock mine ? " Gail took a breath , then another . " What were you doing outside ? " " Nothing . " The kitten mewed to get on the bed , and Karen picked it up , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen . I saw Payton 's cigarette . " " Mom ! " She dropped her forehead onto her knees . " I was n't smoking . Cigarettes stink . " The cat batted a strand of her hair . " I told you not to go outside , and you did it anyway . You 're grounded for a week . " " Mom ! " " You go to day camp , you come home , and you stay inside . I intend to inform your father of this too . " " That is so unfair ! I called Lindsay and said I could n't go out , and she said she had to get her Beanie Baby back . I went to give it to her , that 's all . " " You were in the gazebo with your friends and Payton Cunningham . " " He 's ' the one that should be grounded . He 's a spoiled brat idiot . I hate him ! I hate everybody in this neighborhood . I hate this house . I hate you and I hate Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at her with red-rimmed eyes , and her mouth trembled . There was more than rebellion in that reaction , Gail thought . Quietly she said , " Karen , what happened out there ? Why did you scream ? " Karen wavered . " Do n't be afraid . Did Payton do something to you ? " Gail sat beside her on the edge of the bed . " He kissed me . I did n't want him to , Mom . " Her eyes filled . " I did n't . Jennifer let him , but I did n't want to . He grabbed me . He was laughing . " Gail folded her in an embrace . " Oh , sweetie . It 's okay . Good for you , saying no . Do n't do anything with a boyeverthat you do n't want to . " Gail kissed the top of her head . " You 're a good , good girl . I 'm proud of you . " " Mom , I 'm sorry . " Karen lifted her tear-blotched face . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hate you or Anthony , I swear . " . " Well . You 're still grounded . " " I know . " The summer sun had browned Karen 's skin and streaked her hair . Her adventure in the backyard had tangled it . Gail combed it with her fingers . " Is it so bad here ? You 're making friends . You know , Anthony and I were talking about the house tonight . He wants to put a pool in the backyard . What do you think ? You could have your friends over . Invite the girls from the old neighborhood . " " That would be fun . " " You loved this house when we first saw it . Remember ? You and Anthony . I think I said yes because you both loved it so much . " Gail sat quietly for a few moments , rocking Karen . " Are you hungry ? You missed dinner . " " Very hungry . " " Okay . I 'll bring you something . " Karen clung . " Can I sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mommy ? " " Sweetie ... " Gail extricated herself . " Nobody 's going to get you . " " Yes ! Me scared ! " " Oh , Karen ! " Gail had noticed how she could take these turns , veering from mature to childish . Nothing used to frighten her , but now anything could . Gail was at a loss , not knowing what to do . If Anthony was here , he would not want a visitor in their bed . To start a precedent meant breaking it later . But now Karen needed her . Finally she said , " Okay . Just for tonight . " Karen flung herself at Gail and wrapped her long legs around her waist . Her body was taut as a wire . " Carry me . Carry me , Mommy . " Leaning back against the weight , Gail went across the hall , opened the door to her room , and dropped Karen on her side of the king-size bed , where she bounced , then burrowed under the sheet and light summer blanket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen 's room , found the kitten under a chair , and brought her back across the hall . " Do n't you let her pee in my bed . " She tucked Missy under the covers . " I 'll be back in a few minutes . " " Where are you going ? " " To get something for you to eat . I wo n't be long . " " Tell me a story . " " Karen , I really ca n't tonight . I have some work to finish . " " Daddy always tells me a story . " " I doubt that . " Gail turned on the ceiling fan . " I 'll bring you a book , okay ? " She chose one quickly from Karen 's collection and assured her again she 'd be right back . Once around the corner , Gail almost broke into a run . There would be a hearing early in the morning , and earlier still she had to meet her client and go over the testimony . Gail berated herself for not having prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had intervened to pick away at what little time she had . A divorce case , Wendell and Jamie Sweet . The Sweets . A funny name for two people who detested each other so thoroughly . The judge would set an amount for temporary support and an award for attorney 's fees . Gail was hopeful she could collect at least twenty thousand dollars . She had put in the hours to justify it . If the judge signed the order , she could take care of some past due bills at her office and pay overhead for the next month . She made Karen a sandwich and some chocolate milk , then turned on the gas stove to boil water for coffee . While it was heating , she put away the leftovers and rinsed the dishes . Lightning flickered to the east , an ocean storm too far away for thunder . The palm trees were spiky silhouettes . Her own reflection looked back at her , a tall woman with tousled blond hair . The phone rang just as she had started back up the stairs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour it would be one of three people : her mother , a frantic client , or Anthony . She wanted it to be Anthony . They would talk for a little while , and everything would be all right again . There was an extension on a table just around the corner in the living room . A streetlight shone weakly through the blinds , making jagged stripes across the floor . She set the tray down . " Hello ? " The only reply was a faint buzz that said the line was open . She heard some background noises and thought it might be traffic . " Hello ? Anthony ? " For a second she thought that something was wrong with the connection . There were low-pitched clicks and echoes . Then her mind registered a pattern resembling human speech . It was speech . A robot . A computer . Something speaking in a metallic monotone . Then she recognized her name . GailConnor . Then she fixed on another word . Die . Her breath stopped . goingtodie , bitch . You'regoingtodie . As if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its cradle . Then she laughed . Laughed at her own fear . " You little shit . " She marched across the living room to pull down a slat in the blinds . Lights from the Cunningham house shone in small patches through the high hedge that ran down the side of their property . She thought of calling his parents but without proof , what could she say ? She took the tray upstairs . Karen was already asleep , her book open on her stomach . " Thank God . " Gail tiptoed to the phone by her bed to check the caller-ID box . A red light blinked , indicating a new call . She pressed a button . The display said PAY PHONE . She whispered , " Well , are n't you clever ? " Gail hit the button to delete the entry , striking it out of her mind . She turned off the ringer . Bending low , she kissed Karen 's cheek . " A story tomorrow . I promise . " Gail quietly unpacked the banker 's box that held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dissolution of Marriage . She spread out the pleadings and exhibits on Anthony 's side of the bed , careful not to disturb the little mound softly snoring on hers . It was almost two o'clock in the morning when she turned off the light .
