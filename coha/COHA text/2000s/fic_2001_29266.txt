I was at my desk , in my office , with my feet up on the windowsill , and a yellow pad in my lap , thinking about baseball . It 's what I always think about when I 'm not thinking about sex . Susan says that supreme happiness for me would probably involve having sex while watching a ball game . Since she knows this , I 've never understood why , when we 're at Fenway Park , she remains so prudish . My focus this morning was on one of those " 100 greatest " lists that the current millennium had spawned . In the absence of a 100 greatest sexual encounters list ( where I was sure I would figure prominently ) , I was vetting the 100 greatest baseball players list and comparing it to my own . Mine was of more narrow compass , being limited to players I 'd seen . But even so , the official list needed help . I was penciling in Roy Campanella ahead of Johnny Bench , when my door opened and a man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at , blond , tight figure , nice clothes . The man was wearing aviator sunglasses . He looked like he might have a view on Roy Campanella , but I was pretty sure she would n't . On the other hand , she might have a view on sexual encounters . I could go either way . Good morning , " I said , to let them know there were no hard feelings about them interrupting me . " Spenser ? " the man said . " That 's me , " I said . " I 'm Walter Clive , " he said . " This is my daughter Penny . " " Sit down , " I said . " I have coffee made . " " That would be nice . " I went to the Mr. Coffee on the filing cabinet and poured us some coffee , took milk and sugar instructions , and passed the coffee around . When we were settled in with our coffee , Clive said , " Do you follow horse racing , sir ? " " No . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . " " He 's still a baby , " Clive said , " but there are people who will tell you that he 's going to be the next Secretariat . " " I 've heard of Secretariat , " I said . " Good . " " I was at Claiborne Farms once and actually met Secretariat , " I said . " He gave a large lap . " He smiled a pained smile . Horse people , I have noticed , are not inclined to think of horses in terms of how , or even if , they kiss . " That 's fine , " he said . Penny sat straight in her chair , her hands folded in her lap , her knees together , her ankles together , her feet firmly on the floor . She was wearing white gloves and a set of pearls , and a dark blue dress that did n't cover her knees . I was glad that it did n't . " I own Three Fillies Stables . Named after my three daughters . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Yes , sir . I do n't breed them , I buy and syndicate . " Penny was wearing shoes that matched her dress . They were conservative heels , but not unfashionable . Her ankles were great . " In the past month , " Clive said , " there has been a series of attacks on our horses . " " Attacks ? " " Someone is shooting them . " " Dead ? " " Some die , some survive . " " Do we have a theory ? " I said . " No , sir . The attacks seem entirely random and without motivation . " " Insurance scam ? " " Nothing so crude as shooting the horse , " Clive said . He was tall and athletic and ridiculously handsome . He had a lot of white teeth and a dark tan . His silver hair was thick and smooth . He was wearing a navy blazer with a Three Fillies crest on it , an open white shirt , beige linen trousers , and burgundy loafers with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " Eliminate the competition ? " Clive smiled indulgently . " Some of the horses who 've been shot are barn ponies , not even Thoroughbreds-to think you could do anything constructive for your own horse , by eliminating other horses . . . not possible . " " Only a dumb city guy would even think of such a thing , " I said . He smiled again . It was a smile that said , Of course I 'm superior to you , and both of us know it , but I 'm a good guy and am not going to hold it against you . " You 're a detective , you have to ask these questions , " he said kindly . He smiled again . Penny smiled . I smiled back . Were n't we all just dandy . Penny had big eyes , the color of morning glories . Her eyes were nearly as big as Susan 's , with thick lashes . Her smile was not superior . It was friendly . . . and maybe a little more . " Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clive went on . " Unsuccessful ? " " Yes . His groom , Billy Rice , was in the stall with him , at night . Hugger had been sort of peckish that day and Billy was worried about him . While he was there someone opened the stall door . Billy shined his flashlight , and saw a rifle barrel poking through the open door . When the light came on , the rifle barrel disappeared and there were running footsteps . By the time Billy peeked out around the door , there was nothing . " " Footprints ? " I said . " No . " " Could he describe the gun barrel ? " " The gun barrel ? What 's to describe ? " " Did it have a magazine under the barrel , like a Winchester ? Long stock or not ? Front sight ? Gun barrels are not all the same . " " Oh God , " Clive said , " I do n't know . " I tried not to smile a smile that said , Of course I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm a good guy and am not going to hold it against you . " Cops ? " I said . " Local police , " Clive said . " And I have my own security consultant . " " Local police are the Columbia County Sheriff 's Department , " Penny said . " The deputy 's name is Becker . " " I wish to hire you , sir , to put a stop to this , " Clive said . " To prevent the horse from being hurt ? " " That certainly . " " Usually I get only one end of the horse , " I said . Penny laughed . Clive said , " Excuse me ? " " Daddy , " Penny said , " he 's saying sometimes he gets a client who 's a horse 's ass . " " Oh , of course . Guess I 'm too worried to have a sense of humor . " " Sure , " I said . " Well , sir , are you interested or not ? " " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Am I sleeping on a blanket in the horse 's stall , with a knife in my teeth ? " He smiled to show that he really did have a sense of humor even though he was worried . " No , no , " he said . " I have some armed security in place . An agency in Atlanta . I would like you to look at the security and let me know what you think . But , primarily , I want you to find out who is doing this and , ah , arrest them , or shoot them , or whatever is the right thing . " " And what makes you think I 'm the man for the job ? " I said . Penny smiled at me again . She thought my modesty was very becoming . " The horse world is a small one , sir . You were involved in some sort of case over there in Alton a few years back , with Jumper Jack Nelson . I knew of it . I talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Attorney 's Office . My attorney looked into it . We talked with the FBI in Atlanta . We talked with a man named Hugh Dixon with whom I once did some business . We talked to a Massachusetts State Police captain named Healy , and a Boston police captain named Quirk . " " How the hell did you find Hugh Dixon ? " I said . " I have money , sir . My attorneys are resourceful . " " And I 'm the man ? " " Yes , sir , you are . " " Fairly expensive , " I said . " What are your fees ? " Clive said . I told him . " That will not be an issue , " he said . " And who is the outfit in Atlanta that 's on the job now ? " I said . " Security South . " Meant nothing to me . " The on-site supervisor is a man named Delroy . Jon Delroy . " That meant nothing to me either . " Will Mr. Delroy be pleased to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " No , " Penny said . " I do n't think he will be pleased to see you . " Clive looked at her . " Well , it 's the truth , Daddy . He will be absolutely goddamned livid . " Clive smiled . He could n't help being condescending , but it was a genuine smile . He liked his daughter . " Penny has been quiet during our interview , Mr. Spenser . But do n't assume that it 's habitual . " " Jon will have trouble with you bringing in someone over him , " Penny said . " Mr. Spenser may as well know that now . " Clive nodded . " He 's not really ' over ' Jon , " Clive said . " But Jon may feel a bit compromised . That a problem to you , Mr. Spenser ? " " No . " " Really ? " Penny said . " You think you can work with someone like that ? " " I 'll win him over , " I said . " How ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that an oxymoron ? " she said . " You 're right , " I said . " Maybe I 'll just threaten him . "
