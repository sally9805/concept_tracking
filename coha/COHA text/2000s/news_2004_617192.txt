<p> Atlanta attorneys Martin Chitwood and Oscar Persons agree on this much : The corporate scandals of the last few years have changed the battleground where they fight shareholder lawsuits . <p> " I would have to say that there is a ratcheting up of fear " at corporations , said Persons , an Alston &; Bird senior partner who began defending public companies when securities litigation was not even a full-time specialty in Atlanta . <p> In the current anti-corporate environment , companies are worried about getting a " fair shake , " he said . <p> Chitwood , who is considered the plaintiffs ' lawyer in Georgia , thinks publicity about the scandals would make juries more sympathetic to his side . <p> He has to guess , because neither he nor Persons has actually tried a securities case . Shareholder lawsuits rarely get to trial ; they 're either dismissed or settled . <p> But Chitwood thinks the possibility of a sympathetic jury adds to the pressure on companies to settle . <p> The lawsuits Persons and Chitwood regularly butt heads over are aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock prices nose-dive . <p> Nationally , billions of dollars are at stake in such lawsuits , which usually allege corporate fraud . The number of suits jumped 31 percent nationwide in 2002 , the year after the Enron scandal , according to Stanford Law School . The law school anticipates that when 2003 figures are tabulated , the number of suits will be just as high . <p> The high settlement rate means , even with abundant time and money devoted to investor claims , allegations of fraud are seldom resolved . Settlements typically use language in which defendants deny wrongdoing and plaintiffs acknowledge the difficulty of proving their cases , say attorneys on both sides . <p> Though settlements can and do run into billions of dollars , they represent a fraction of the damages claimed by shareholders . In 2002 , the fraction was 2.3 percent . Cases that were settled in 2002 yielded an average of more than $24 million . Those numbers add to the pressure on companies to settle . <p> Those statistics are for federal suits that were granted class-action status , representing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek class-action status because of the number of potential plaintiffs and the cost of trying claims one at a time . <p> Chitwood , 59 , and Persons , 64 , recently talked about the current environment and the 1995 legislation that changed the rules under which they work . The two have offices a block from each other in Midtown , but their views on securities litigation are miles apart . <p> From their opposite sides of the negotiating table , Persons and Chitwood view investor lawsuits as either slandering corporate America or helping keep the scamps in check . <p> Persons thinks investor lawsuits rarely have merit . <p> " None of the cases I 've been involved in , even after going through all the investigation you have to do on the defendant 's side , have I found any of them or any of their people to have committed any kind of fraud , " Persons said . <p> Chitwood 's thinks " shareholder litigation always benefits investors . " <p> " Just think , " he said , " how significant the securities fraud would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Big money at stake <p> Their opposing philosophies have led both to high-stakes cases . <p> A fraction of the 200-plus public companies in Georgia have been sued by shareholders in recent years . But the list includes names like Coca-Cola , BellSouth , Mirant , WestPoint Stevens , and most recently , Amvescap 's Invesco Funds Group , and Friedman 's , one of the largest retail jewelry chains in the country . All are defendants in pending cases . <p> Alston &; Bird represents BellSouth , Mirant and WestPoint Stevens , all of which have been sued by Chitwood 's firm , Chitwood &; Harley . <p> Chitwood was part of the team that won the biggest settlement for investors in 2002 : His firm was a co-lead counsel in a suit against what is now Bank of America , which was settled for $490 million . <p> The firm was a co-lead counsel in the shareholder lawsuit against Connecticut-based Oxford Health Plans in a related suit against accounting firm KPM . Those cases were settled in March for $300 million . <p> The Friedman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alston &; Bird represents Friedman 's . Chitwood sued Friedman 's on Nov. 14 , after the Savannah company said its bad-debt allowance was too low and that it had put its chief financial officer on leave . Since then , the company has said it will have to restate earnings going back through 2000 . <p> ' I become incensed ' <p> Persons , the son a Baptist minister , found a calling of his own in securities litigation , starting in the early 1970s . His first case left him with an outlook that persists today . <p> The client , he said , was sued " on the theory still used by the plaintiffs : You sue everybody who 's around , hoping that if you throw enough mud , something will stick . " <p> " I become incensed when companies that are going about trying to do their business and do their best for shareholders are accused of fraud when it 's not the case , " he said . " My hair goes up on the back of my neck on that . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another passion is the Republican Party . The walls of his office are plastered with photos of Persons with Ronald Reagan , Gerald Ford , George Bush , Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole . <p> Persons chaired Dole 's presidential campaigns in Georgia in 1988 and 1996 , and the 1992 campaign of the late Sen. Paul Coverdell . From 1971 to 1993 , Persons served as general counsel to the Georgia Republican Party . <p> Politics , like securities litigation , divides Persons and Chitwood . The latter said he is not registered with either the Republican or Democratic parties but " tends to support Democratic candidates . It 's typically the Democrats who are in favor of legislation that is protective of shareholders . " <p> It was a Democratic president who vetoed the 1995 legislation that binds Persons and Chitwood in what Persons calls a " professional " but " acrimonious " relationship . Congress overrode the veto . <p> President Bill Clinton supported the goal of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 , which is " ending frivolous lawsuits , " he noted in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to sign legislation that will have the effect of closing the courthouse door on investors who have legitimate claims . " <p> In a nutshell , the act : <p> * Calls for the shareholder with the most at stake to be the lead plaintiff , who picks the lead law firm . The purpose is to have shareholders calling the shots instead of the lawyers , Persons said . <p> Other plaintiffs may have their own lawyers , but lead law firms are in charge of a suit and are in line for the lion 's share of fees . <p> * Delays evidence-gathering until a court decides if a case should continue or be dismissed . That reduces costs . The discovery process is " unbelievably expensive , " Persons said . <p> But the delay is a hardship on his side , said Chitwood . <p> " You almost have to know most of the case before you file it , " he said . " It 's different from any other litigation . " <p> * Gives public companies a shield against lawsuits if they provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be specific about alleged instances of fraud . <p> Persons does n't think it has worked as well as intended . <p> " In my view , we still have abusive litigation , " he said . " I think that is a monster that is still out there . " <p> The monster is the legislation , not the litigation , Chitwood argues . <p> " The securities reform act of 1995 was a step backward , " he said . " It was meant to be a step backwards . The people who lobbied for it and the Contract-for-America Congress that passed it meant for it to be a protection and an insulation for corporate America so they would have more freedom to do as they pleased without fear of lawsuits . <p> " Scandals resulted . ... The Enrons grew straight out of that . " <p> In his view , the 1995 act has made it tougher to bring shareholder lawsuits and the courts more demanding of plaintiffs , who he maintains are outmanned and outgunned by corporate defendants . <p> " That would be the spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's point of view . <p> What has happened , said Persons , is that sometimes courts bend over backward to avoid dismissing shareholder lawsuits . And attorneys who lose on their bids to lead the case find other ways to attack , he said . <p> " The competing plaintiffs and plaintiffs ' firms that lose out on being lead counsel still want to get a place at the table , or a piece of the action , " said Persons . <p> So some of the plaintiffs and their lawyers may file separate suits against different , but related , defendants . They may sue a corporation 's directors , standing in for the corporation . Or they may sue the trustees of a pension plan if company stock is included in the plan 's assets . <p> Millions invested <p> Chitwood views his work as a " civic duty . " <p> On the other hand , " I 'm a businessman . We have to make sure that our business is profitable . <p> " We 're on a contingency basis , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have substantial merit , because we invest sometimes millions of dollars worth of attorney time in these cases , and we have invested in the largest cases millions of dollars of costs . We do n't do that lightly . " <p> Chitwood wo n't say what his firm 's contingency percentage is , but Persons says plaintiffs ' lawyers get a third of each settlement . Other lawyers estimate it 's a quarter to a third . <p> " The stockholders do n't get very much out of this thing , " said Persons . " They will get something more than what they had before . But the big cheese is the attorneys ' fees . " <p> Attorneys on both sides of the battle say Chitwood 's strengths lie in evaluating the best cases to take , and in his ability to form relationships with institutional investors , such as mutual funds and pension funds , which are increasingly the lead plaintiffs in shareholder suits . <p> Chitwood stipulates to both counts . He 'll also admit he 's wanted to be a lawyer since high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Georgia Tech and later decided to study law . <p> " I felt then , and I guess I still believe , that lawyers have a better opportunity to understand the rules upon which society operates , " said Chitwood . " Therefore , lawyers have an opportunity to have an influence on society , perhaps disproportionately to what most people in most businesses would have . <p> " I always wanted to be someone who would be able to have an impact on society . " The number of shareholder lawsuits dropped in 1996 , the first year after a major change in the law governing those cases . But the numbers picked up again in 1997 . At least 199 suits were filed in 2003 . The total through Dec. 31 has not been compiled . Number of federal suits filed 1996 : 108 1997 : 174 1998 : 240 1999 : 204 2000 : 213 2001 : 172 2002 : 226 The total amount paid to settle suits has been rising . The total in 2000 was enlarged by Cendant 's $3.19 billion settlement with shareholders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in billions , from ' 96 to ' 02 . ) Sources : Cornerstone Research , Stanford Law School / TROY OXFORD / Staff
