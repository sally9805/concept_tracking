<p> Jason Wu greets every day in San Francisco 's Civic Center with meditation and the slow , graceful exercises of Falun Gong , the spiritual movement banned in China and considered dangerous by some expatriates . <p> Since he began practicing Falun Gong in 1996 , the 70-year-old said , he has felt more energetic and healthy and has had no need to see a doctor . <p> A belief system that incorporates the breathing and exercises of qigong , which has been practiced for millennia , Falun Gong gained the sympathy of elected officials across the United States after the Chinese government moved to silence it in 1999 . <p> But many American counselors , qigong teachers and lay people liken the movement to a cult . They say it can endanger adherents and that it actually benefits from the controversy surrounding it . <p> Followers say such criticism originates in Chinese government propaganda . The Chinese government allegedly put Falun Gong followers in prisons and labor camps in 1999 , and founder Li Hongzhi fled to the United States . <p> San Francisco 's Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 for repressing the movement . Congress passed just such a resolution last year . And in July representatives of new Chinese-oriented media outlets with financial ties to Falun Gong testified on Capitol Hill about the influence of China 's government overseas . <p> Falun Gong does not maintain a membership list , but it claims 100 million practitioners worldwide , with the bulk in China . The Chinese government says the movement has only 2 million followers in China . <p> For people in China , where religious activity is strictly controlled , Falun Gong seemed to fill a spiritual void when it was founded in 1992 . Its core texts , Zhuan Falun and Falun Gong , teach people to be truthful , compassionate and tolerant . <p> Adherents in the Bay Area , who are estimated in the thousands , practice the exercises at more than two dozen public sites every day . They are mostly Chinese American and have a range of professional backgrounds . <p> Wu , a retired electronics technician , bent and glided beneath a double row of trees as traditional Chinese music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed out flyers detailing Falun Gong 's teachings and five main exercises and denouncing China 's government . <p> " The number of Falun Gong practitioners simply grew too large for the Communist leadership 's liking , " Wu 's flyer reads . " The persecution was ordered by Communist leader Jiang Zemin , who feared losing control over people 's minds . " <p> Cult or not ? <p> Critics say that even though the movement does n't keep formal membership lists , its demand for loyalty makes it a cult . <p> " They 're told not to think negative thoughts , and are given fears if they consider any other reality , " said Steven Alan Hassan , a Somerville , Mass. , cult counselor . Founder Li Hongzhi " comes very much out of the cult extreme , the authoritarian stereotype . " <p> David Clark , a Pennsylvania cult counselor , said Falun Gong 's fight against the Chinese government is a " clever marketing mechanism . " He and others dismiss Falun Gong 's assertion that the Chinese government is the force behind criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining access to get people to join the cause , " Clark said . " There 's a certain level of nobility wanting to defend the rights of people who are hurting . " <p> Qigong teachers and even those who do not consider Falun Gong a cult are concerned about followers ' belief that their faith will help cure illness . <p> " The main risk associated is the medical neglect potential . That reflects in part the idiosyncrasies of the individual practitioners , " said Michael Langone , executive director of the International Cultic Studies Association in Florida . He said Falun Gong is not strictly a cult because members are " free to come and go as they please . " <p> Many followers believe that retribution for past deeds is the root of sickness . They believe Western medicine treats symptoms and does not address the root causes of illness  --  for which some practitioners believe they should rely on the healing powers of Falun Gong . <p> " Average qigong treatments and hospital treatments only defer to the remaining half of life or later those tribulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Zhuan Falun . " The karma is not removed at all . " <p> Illness and karma <p> Samuel Luo , 34 , launched Falungonginfo.org , which denounces the movement , based on his mother 's and stepfather 's experience . <p> " I consider myself a victim of the Falun Gong because my parents were hurt by it , and the harmony of our family has been seriously damaged , " said Luo , a San Francisco massage therapist who practices tui na , traditional Chinese bodywork . <p> Peiling Cao , 64 , Luo 's stepfather , is often bedridden for days with gout , but it took years of pleading from his children before he recently agreed to see a doctor . <p> " If you do bad , then it generates karma that will make you become sick , " said Demi Chou , 59 , Cao 's wife and Luo 's mother . " Whenever I run into a health problem , I look inside to see which way I 'm not doing well . If you really go with the principles as the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview attended by Falun Gong leaders , Chou said she fervently believed in communism for decades . Her life was lacking something until she found Falun Gong . She credits the movement with helping her become an energetic , kind and patient person and said she has not seen a doctor since she began practicing in 1998 . <p> Her son speaks at conferences , writes newspaper editorials in Chinese-language newspapers and reaches out to others concerned about the influence of Falun Gong . He was scheduled to speak in July on a Falun Gong panel at the International Cultic Studies Association 's conference in Spain , but organizers canceled the panel after a representative of the Falun Dafa Association of Spain threatened to sue for defamation . Criticism of Falun Gong could be used by the Chinese government to persecute followers , the lawyer said . <p> Follower Eric Huang , 55 , a computer hardware engineer who lives in Sunnyvale , said the faith does n't prohibit seeking medical treatment . <p> " In Falun Gong , we feel sickness is related to karma and is a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of faith . It can not be explained by science , until science reaches a certain state . " <p> Falun Gong teachings  --  On people who are sick : The root cause of their problem and all their misfortune is karma , that black-matter karmic field . ... Those bad beings are also yin in nature , they 're all black , and that 's why they can come onto the body  --  the environment suits them . That 's the root cause of people 's health problems , it 's the chief source of them . Of course , there are two other forms . One of them is really , really small , high-density tiny beings . They 're something like a cluster of karma . The other is as if it 's transported through a conduit , but it 's pretty rare , and all of it is accumulated through the generations .  --  On hospitals : If hospitals could n't heal , why would people believe in them and go there for treatments ? ... It 's just that their treatment methods are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some diseases are pretty serious .  --  On ancient Chinese medicine : It was ahead of today 's medical sciences . Some people think , " Modern medicine is so advanced  --  CT scans can examine the inside of the body , and we can do ultrasound , imaging and X-rays . " Sure , modern equipment is pretty advanced , but I 'd say it 's still not as good as ancient Chinese medical science . ... It 'll be years before today 's Western medicine catches up . <p> Source : Zhuan Falun , by Li Hongzhi , translated at falundafa.org ( 1 ) Amy Wu ( foreground ) and Ivan Velinov practice Falun Gong exercises at the S.F.
