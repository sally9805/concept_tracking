I was not born a liar . I became one when , in the household of my youth , candy was outlawed . My mother , already wary of anything smacking of excess , had read several popular books on health , and these books confirmed her suspicions about the unhallowed nature of saturated fats . She scoured our house of all butters and lards . With them went the thing I loved best : sugar . These staples of my childhood diet were replaced with items of dubious edibility , sounding less like food than like the capitals of foreign countries : Quinoa . Carob . Couscous . If my sister and I begged for something sweet , my mother would say , " Have a sesame biscuit . " I felt as if we had reverted to a primitive age  --  before the birth of the recipe , before flavor , when we ate whatever we could club to death . <p> The catch was , I knew my mother had a wretched sweet tooth . I 'd seen her swoon over a spoonful of chocolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her lip . Why , I wondered , should we fight it so ? But fight it we did . Together . <p> While eating my desserts of raisins and whey , I 'd close my eyes and dream there was a lollipop in my mouth . Eventually , I caved . To get my fix , I 'd sneak to the corner store , where candy was arrayed in gorgeous , foiled rows . The less plausible the design of the candy , the more I wanted it . This one looked like chewing tobacco . That one exploded when you placed it in a can of Coke . I bought whichever caught my fancy . It became sickening to try to finish the candy before I got home , so I began to smuggle it in and consume it in secret . Once , I tried to eat an entire grocery bag full of candy , which I 'd been stockpiling for weeks , in one sitting . I was thwarted by a solid-chocolate Santa I 'd bought for 25 cents at a post-Christmas discount . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my stomach as I gazed at his gnawed-off head . <p> Memories of my prepubescent self circle shark-like around eating , dreaming of eating , lying about eating . Did I ever do anything nice ? Did I have a tendency to stand up for the underdog ? I was a big girl with a round belly and vitamin-rich hair . Once I got going , I could run pretty fast . Photos show me cartwheeling . Oh , who might I have been , what sort of noble being , if I had only been allowed a bit of candy in my youth ? <p> My excess with sweets led to excess in other forums . In college , I drank , ate , smoked , partied , did whatever I wanted . I became who I thought I was  --  a somewhat happy , immoderate American girl who never denies herself an emotion , an opinion , or a candy bar . Once , in the midst of these years , I persuaded my mother to go to one of those highway chain restaurants I loved . Such places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that I left them with a feeling I liked  --  being stuffed to the gills . I enjoyed being with my mother , but in those years my bid to be my own independent spirit put an unnatural cast on our conversations . I was always quietly out to convince her I was right about fights we 'd had years ago . My mother , for her part , was an immovable force . She is Latvian , and like all Latvians , she has a sober bearing and a quick wit , and is capable of mighty silence . <p> When we went to restaurants together , it was as if we had returned to the dinner table at which we were still silently debating the merits of the candy ban . I would order the greasiest , thrice-fried foods  --  bacon nachos or beer fries with a side of blue cheese dipping sauce . And my mother would choose the most healthful item on the menu  --  say , a salad with nonfat vinaigrette and water with no ice . When the waitress would ask for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the menu  --  for example , a molten rainbow cake with whipped cream  --  while my mother would look away , as if to give me a kind of shabby privacy . <p> But the worst was when she would ask for a second spoon . This meant that when my rainbow cake arrived and I began to eat , my mother would sample it with a tentative bite and then , setting down her spoon , she would say softly , " Yuck . " <p> Yuck . That always did it for me . Thereafter , I would eat without tasting , to make a point . For I knew , in the end , she was right . My rainbow cake was disgusting . She had science on her side , not to mention age , grace , and dignity . All I had was an abstract devotion to pleasure , to the idea that it was healthy to throw off caution , to be unburdened by consequence . <p> Anticipating all this at our lunch , I cleared my throat and asked my mother the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , to my surprise , already shut her menu and was staring into middle distance . She looked beautiful and incongruous under the green-glass-shaded lamps , a wall of baseball memorabilia behind her . <p> " Split pea soup , " she said . <p> " Really ? " I said , taken aback . " It comes with a side of cheese logs . Those are pretty high in fat . " <p> My mother did n't take the bait . She was looking out the window . It was a rainy day . Cars sluiced by below billboards . And then she gave me an answer I did not anticipate . It was a story . A story about the war . <p> At 5 years old , my mother is a serious , obedient child . Her world is a farmhouse in Latvia set amid a field of flax . Gooseberries grow there , fat and seedy , tangy currants , apple trees . Her days are busy  --  there are farmhands to pester , a soft mongrel dog for a playmate , and two sisters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latvia in 1940 , under the pretext of protecting it from the Nazis , my mother , in her farmhouse , feels no fear . In the kitchen , pots clash , and in some beautiful alchemy the currants find their way into tart jellies , the apples into turnovers , and the table , at noonday , is crowded with people . <p> Then one June night in 1944 , on the eve of the return of Stalin 's army , a force that was to violently occupy the Baltics for the next 50 years , my mother is bundled into a horse cart to begin her five years as one of the war 's displaced persons . The family passes through Riga at night , the city quiet as a seashell , its red clay roofs like a thousand leather books left open along the shores of the Daugava . They catch the last ship out of Liepaja , which takes them to Poland . A year of travel follows  --  by train , by foot , with thousands of others . And little to no food . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is n't enough , she distributes four portions : one for each daughter , one for her husband  --  and none for herself Years later , it is this gesture on her mother 's part , the sacrificing of her own bread , that is to be my mother 's weightiest memory . <p> Once they arrive at the DP camps , the monotonous provisions there seem like bounty . Even so , my mother tells me , " When we were in the camps , we used to get so tired of the food . Food would arrive in big trucks , always one item in huge quantities . You 'd have corn bread for weeks and weeks . Hard , stale corn bread , until you swore you would never in your life eat corn bread again . " And yet the barracks seem like a high old time compared to the fate she might have had if she had succumbed to her semi-starvation . <p> " But you know the food I remember best ? It was the pea soup . Endless pea soup . You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd get some disappointing pea soup in your bowl . " <p> Good enough , though , if you were a hungry little girl . <p> In 1945 , an aid worker at a DP camp in Germany asserted that " the strongest language " of complaint among refugees was reserved for " the deadly monotony of the diet . " As for pea soup , its ubiquity has been noted with a surprising amount of documentation . The Latvian refugees even invented a term for it : zalas briesmas  --  the Green Horror . <p> When Stalin forcibly annexed the Baltic nations  --  Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania  --  at the conclusion of the war , the allies turned a blind eye . Those who had not fled were subjects of a new totalitarian regime , and many were harassed , killed , or swept off to Siberia . For the ones who had fled , the world was disorder . Nothing was solid or whole or familiar . <p> Amid all this , I can see how palliative it might have been to settle down in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tea . A slice of hazelnut torte , perhaps , with a strong , hot Darjeeling and a sleeve of sugar . This was , in fact , the sort of delicacy my grandmother , my vecmamma , would produce during family gatherings in this country long into her old age  --  layers of cake , cream , and currant jelly sprinkled with the broken meat of toasted hazelnuts . This torte seems to me now an offering to ghosts . It was what she wished she could have offered her three daughters in the barracks instead of bread or , worse , no bread . <p> A body that has once been hungry always retains its hungry ghost . In November 1944 , in the same year my mother was on the refugee trail , a scientist named Ancel Keys began his now-famous Minnesota Starvation Experiment . To help treat and refeed the wrecked civilian populations of the war , Keys studied 36 healthy American menas they experienced six months of controlled semi-starvation . As these previously healthy men succumbed to a shockingly uniform series of physical and psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessiveness . Gone were the topics of sex , sports , politics . The men were incapable of not speaking about food . Their bodies ' drive to regain weight drove them into a neurotic agitation . When several of the men broke down and consumed extra calories , they suffered deep shame and self-disgust . During the refeeding period , some of the subjects found themselves utterly out of control , eating so much they became sick . It was as if the peace of the fed body was lost to them . <p> Once , as a teenager , when coming into a room where my mother was unloading groceries , I accidentally kicked a loaf of bread onto the floor . My mother stood , pointing , and an expression so fierce crossed her face that I caught my breath . It was not the first time I had wandered , haplessly , into my mother 's childhood . <p> Growing up , I wanted to hear about her war years , but she seemed unrelieved by the act of telling . Some of it she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my known life , while hers was a secret , right there in plain view . <p> Then , in 2004 , my husband and I went to teach in Latvia . The country was liberated by then , the U.S.S.R. having collapsed in 1991 . For the entire five months of our stay , we lived like the Latvians and dressed like the Latvians , and yet not once were we ever mistaken for Latvians . " It 's because you smile so much , " explained my friend Inta . <p> But off the streets , in their small , body-warmed rooms , I discovered the Latvians were themselves enamored of a curiously cheerful ritual : eating cake for lunch . <p> " Come have lunch in the faculty room , " Inta would say , " we are having cake . " Cake for lunch ! It shone through my American density like a sunbeam . Sometimes there was an occasion , but sometimes there was not . Any kind of cake would domocha cakes , marzipan cakes , cakes with cherries , moist with liqueurs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  honey cake . The honey in Latvia was potent , spiked with lavender . It retained a sharp , outdoorsy bitterness , as if you 'd cut your tongue when you tasted it . Whenever I ate honey cake , I remembered a life I 'd never had . The life , I suppose . I might have lived as a Latvian . A woodstove crackled in the gaps between imagination and memory . My mother turned from this stove , wearing an apron , and smiled at me . Are you happier here ? I whispered . Is it better now ? <p> Upon my arrival home , I was excited to tell my mother about Latvians ' guiltless preoccupation with sweets . I also felt vindicated . " There is nothing wrong with cake , " I 'd announce . " There is only something wrong with you . You ca n't enjoy yourself . " I 'd planned to say all this , but I did n't . <p> Standing before her on U.S. soil-how I 'd missed her !  --  I realized that this was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to give me permission to eat cake . I wanted her to say , " Be joyous , be guilt-free . " I went all the way across the world for this permission . But what could I tell her that she did n't already know ? I 'd never stood in a long line for food . I 'd never treasured a bowl of soup . She 'd been raised in a barracks . Did I expect this fact to be solved by a sweet ? For the first time I considered that I was attempting , well into my 30s , to eat my mother 's candy . To drink her wine . And that this discomfort with her life experience was , in itself , my worst excess . <p> Two years ago , my parents separated after 42 years of marriage . My mother moved into a condominium on the outskirts of our city . Here , so late in life , was one more transit , one more passage . When I visit her there , my head spins . I look for my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks a lot like me . My own son . <p> During a recent visit , I find myself scouring the kitchen for something that might interest this towheaded 2-year-old . The condo , sunny and new , is crowded : my family , my sister , her husband , and their two children . My mother announces her plan to jump in the shower , and I take the opportunity of her absence to open the floor for discussion . " What 's here for breakfast ? " I ask the room . <p> " There 's a box of Sticks ' n Oats , " says my husband . " You should try it . Good , if it does n't coagulate in your throat . " I roll my eyes . My mother 's unflagging zeal for health food has become a joke , something by which we identify her , like a birthmark . <p> " Come on , " I say . " What about for the kids ? Is n't there Cheerios or something ? " <p> " There 's desiccated goat 's milk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Ha , " I say . " I almost believe you guys . " Back behind a box of toasted soy nuts , I see a glint of something silver . Can it be ? My fingers close around the familiar shape of a Hershey 's Kiss . In fact , there is a whole cache of them , way back there in a Baggie . I pull one out and stare at it for some time , the conversation going on without me . Then I loosen the Kiss from its little foil jacket and slide it into my mouth . I close my eyes . Creamy , yielding . <p> There is a tap on my shoulder . I turn to face my mother . " What are you doing ? " she asks . <p> I stare at her . Finally , I open my hand , revealing the ball of foil and its tiny white flag of surrender . " Rather , " I say , " what are you doing ? " <p> She looks at the evidence for a moment . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to make this into a tactical interchange . <p> " They say it 's good for you , cacao , " she explains airily . " They 're saying that now . There 's evidence . A lot of studies . " Then a look of indifference flits across her face . She selects her own Kiss , defoils it , and pops it into her mouth . We chew . I look at her beautiful , lined face  --  and I am possessed with a kind of radiant understanding of her mystery and a sense that I am destined to love her without ever being able to completely understand her , heal her , or ask quite the right question , and even if I could , she would never be able to give the answer that satisfies all questions . <p> What if I had asked her , that day at lunch , " Why pea soup ? Why eat the Green Horror now that you 're safe ? " <p> Maybe she would have answered , " I 'm ordering it because I can . Because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer being fed ; I am eating . " Maybe she would have winked at me and said , " Just as you used to sneak to the corner store for candy because you wanted some control back . " ( You knew about that ? ) Or maybe she has fond memories of the Green Horror because it was what she ate in her childhood , just as I ate Chuckles in mine . And childhood is supposed to be happy , and if you ca n't remember yours with any happiness , what hope have you later , when life starts handing you fresh grief ? <p> Or maybe she would have spoken of the ghosts of all the people she 'd left along the road . The people who never made it to the refugee camp , or who were exterminated in camps of a different kind . Or maybe her answer would have been simpler , as perhaps it was for the subjects of Ancel Keys 's study : " Listen , you have to feel it to understand . " Hunger is the space in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world over , the basic properties of food are eclipsed by the getting , the sharing , the hoarding , and the intimation that one 's worth is somehow reflected in the watery portions . <p> The asceticism of my mother 's diet suddenly becomes comprehensible to me . Health food is whole ; you can eat small amounts of it and still be fortified . It is eminently unwasteful . It is , in a way , my mother 's comfort food . It makes the most sense with the world she has seen . I can not eat her cake , you see , because the cake tastes different in her mouth . <p> And me and my candy ? Did my slavering obsession with sweets really belie some flaw , something essentially insatiable about myself or my American childhood ? Or could it be that , for me , candy symbolizes a blessed life , a life I should just be grateful for ? <p> The sponsors of Keys 's study concluded the following : " Many of the so-called American characteristics  --  abounding energy , generosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a well-fed people . " <p> Some well-fed Americans like myself have lives of plenty . Abundance can be a good thing  --  feasts , harvests , rain  --  and does not , in itself , hurt the spirit . Excess hurts the spirit , but excess does not have to be the end result of abundance . I think of another ghost , my grandmother , passing small hunks of bread to her little girls on a train halfway across Poland , headed into the thick of an angry , unlit night . And I know , though she is gone , she would never want any debate between my mother and me on this score . " Eat , " she would say . " Eat what you want . And love . " <p> A shriek of pleasure interrupts mine and my mother 's chocolate moment . It is my son in the other room , amused by some outrageousness of his cousin 's . I can almost see his small face widening in surprise . He shuffles into the kitchen , where we stand , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell . My mother and I stoop to listen . I would give him my bread , of course I would . If we were both hungry , I would give him mine . And that would not be an act of heroism , really . It would not be anything that would require his lifelong indebtedness . It would be love . Love , simple as wheat . <p> When there is n't enough , she distributes lour portions : one for each daughter , one for her husband  --  and none for herself <p> This torte seems an offering to ghosts , what she wished she could have offered them <p> I 'd never stood in a long line for food .
