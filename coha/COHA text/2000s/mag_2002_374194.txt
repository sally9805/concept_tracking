As Tom Crandall drives slowly through the working-class neighborhood of Longview , Texas , kids pour out of their homes and follow the sound of Christian rock blasting from his Chevy pickup . " Hey , kids , do you know what time it is ? " Crandall shouts into a microphone . " We 're gon na have some fun with God ! " <P> The truck stops , Crandall gets out , and the Sidewalk Sunday School begins . " What was the Prodigal Son doing when he left home ? " the 26-year-old minister asks a swarm of giggling children , age 5 and older . As they ponder the answer , he takes a spaghetti strainer out of a sack stuffed with Bibles and turns it into a spiky helmet by filling its holes with nails facing outward . Then he places the metal headgear on a nervous volunteer . A child shouts out the correct answer  --  " Feeding pigs ! "  --  and , as a reward , gets to aim water balloons at the newly anointed human porcupine . <P> Crandall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he and a growing number of other ministers around the country are n't letting small details like that get in the way of their efforts to reach out to the young . " You 've got to do whatever it takes to keep the kids ' attention focused on God , " Crandall says . " You 've got to make it fun , or it 's just more dry religious stuff . " <P> So nowadays lesson plans are based on The Gospel According to the Simpsons , in which Homer stands in as Job , and The Gospel According to Harry Potter , in which the boy wizard 's decision to walk through what appears to be a solid wall to get to the train that will take him to his magical school becomes a meditation on faith . Church facilities have been updated with computer stations for video games like Bible Grand Slam and movie theaters for features like The Creation , narrated by Amy Grant . Teachers are baking unleavened bread as they read Exodus and aiming slingshots at large bottles for a hands-on study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skateboarding , surfing and hiking classes that teens attend with gear in one hand and Bible in the other . In short , churches are preaching to members of the Nickelodeon generation in the showy , attention-grabbing language they understand . <P> And the kids are listening . After the First Baptist Church of Jacksonville , Fla. , opened its kid-friendly facilities last summer , Sunday-school attendance jumped 50% , to 900 students , in just four months . Churches of every denomination and size are trying these new approaches and experiencing similar surges in attendance . " The more kids touch and they hear and they feel , the more likely the content becomes not only interesting , but they comprehend and understand , " says Charlotte Echols , executive director for the child-development program at Highland Park Methodist United Church in Dallas . " That transforms into the good feeling that brings them back next week . "
