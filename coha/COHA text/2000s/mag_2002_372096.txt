Apolo Ohno is scheduled to be a star . He is the best short-track speed skater in the world , and he could win a gold medal in each of his sport 's four Olympic events . At 19 , he has the fresh-faced good looks of a boy-band member , a marketable name and a signature style  --  flowing hair beneath a red bandanna and a soul patch under his lower lip  --  that makes him instantly recognizable . Abandoned by his mother as an infant , reared in Seattle by an itinerant Japanese hair-stylist father , Ohno has also waged the personal struggle required by the modern , feel-good Olympics . <P> There 's only one problem : Ohno can be something of a knucklehead . He is a teenager , just a few years removed from a pattern of skipping school and interrupting training runs with pizza binges . In December a skater named Tommy O'Hare alleged that Ohno and fellow U.S. medal hopeful Rusty Smith , who had already qualified for the American team , tanked the 1,000-m short-track final at the Olympic trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team instead of O'Hare . Despite some damning evidence , an arbitrator exonerated Ohno , but the mini-scandal is a reminder that even with his prodigious talent , Ohno is no sure thing . <P> It is hard to tell if Ohno 's rough edges are the product of an unusual upbringing or merely the symptoms of a flake . His father Yuki emigrated from Tokyo at 18 and became a hair stylist to top models . He traveled the world , married , had Apolo and quickly divorced . Apolo 's mother waived custody and split . He has seen her only in photos . <P> Yuki tried to instill discipline in his son , but Apolo was a tough nut . He chewed rocks in the schoolyard , hung out with a dangerous crowd in his early teens and made an art of defying his father . " I was rough . If my dad said yes , I said no . That 's the way it was for years . " <P> But during the 1994 Winter Olympics , both were riveted by short-track skating , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no marked lanes , at speeds of up to 35 m.p.h . It 's human NASCAR . Ohno had already won a national in-line skating championship , but Rollerbladers do n't compete for gold . So Ohno put himself on ice , and Yuki , happy to see his son inspired , shuttled him to lessons and meets . <P> Within two years , Ohno , though only 14 , was fast enough to get an unprecedented invitation to train at the Olympic complex in Lake Placid , N.Y . But he did n't want to go . When he was dropped off at the airport , he disappeared inside and called a friend to pick him up . For the second flight east , Yuki strapped him to the seat . Ohno quickly became the uncut jewel of the U.S. program , but his lack of dedication was profound . He would duck into a Pizza Hut in the middle of training runs . " I just messed around during training , not focusing , " he says now . " I did n't even know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being overweight and underprepared , Ohno was devastated when he failed to make the ' 98 Olympic team . He flew home and spent a week in a secluded cabin trying to figure out whether he had the makings of an elite athlete . <P> Ohno decided he did , and he has been nearly unstoppable on the ice ever since . He started eating right and became a master of technique , which , in curve-heavy short track , is just as important as the raw power generated by his bullet-shape 5-ft. 7-in. , 165-lb. frame .
