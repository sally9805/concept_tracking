The " F " Word In your article " Is Feminism a Four-letter Word " ( February/March 2001 ) by Jill Nelson , you began by asking the question " what 's in a name ? " A hell of a lot . As a woman who is constantly searching for my place in feminism , I certainly relate to the women in your article who ca n't reconcile themselves with the label " feminist . " Feminism does carry baggage ; it has historically turned its back on women who are not white and privileged . But how do we change that if we turn our backs on feminism ? If we want to address women 's issues of racial and economic inequalities as well as issues of sexual harassment and body image , we need some common ground . As feminists we should not deny that feminism is imperfect any more than we should deny that we as feminists are imperfect . But if we do not work together to unpack the baggage of feminism , we will not be able to fight together for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that belongs exclusively to our white mothers ' or grandmothers ' movement any more than it belongs to one race or class . Feminism is our word-it belongs to all women and men who work for women 's rights . If we do n't reclaim feminism , who will ? TARAH A. DEMANT TACOMA , WASH . As a lawyer , a member of Canada 's Pakistani community , and a wife and mother , I have definitely noticed that the word " feminist " carries a stigma . Many people feel that the narrow ideals it supposedly encompasses have little regard for the reality of their lives . Many also feel that feminists view women who choose to stay home with small children as failures in their efforts to pursue more meaningful work . Many people feel that feminist lesbians hate men and as a result should be given short shrift . As a few of your contributors suggested , the word does not always denote the passionate dream of equality for women all over the world . Why ? It is a desecration of the broad ideal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpopularity of some extreme ideals , held by few but heard by many , and by the perception of a threat to the status quo . ( Do white women really want to make room for women of color in the boardroom when the competition to get there has been so fierce ? ) It is caused by mainstream media 's constant praise of the woman who " has it all " and wears a perfect size six . Do we really want to have it all ? And is " all " all there is ? The mainstream media disrespects feminists by trivializing the achievements of women who are not models or actresses and distracts us from serious issues that concern women by failing to report on them in any depth , if at all . Your magazine is an oasis of knowledge in a desert of ignorance . It informs us about issues that concern all women . I hope that you will survive and thrive so that generations of women and men can benefit from the fountain of knowledge you spill forth . Thank you . SHAHLA KHAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on gender , and most of my students are women who do not call themselves feminists . I spend the first two weeks of class showing how we are all feminists in our beliefs , even when we do not choose to use the name . The term has been tainted by media coverage of only one kind of feminism , and only when there is some sensationalized picture to be painted . Class discussion almost always raises the question about the importance of a name . Calling myself a feminist identifies an attitude I have about the limitations of sex-role stereotypes and the importance of equal opportunity unconstrained by these societal expectations . I am a white male with no personal experience of poverty and only occasional experience with racial discrimination and discrimination due to my sexual orientation , yet no one ever questions the substance or validity of my beliefs because of these characteristics . There is no other word for what I believe in . I am a feminist . JACK DEMAREST WEST LONG BRANCH , N.J. Calling it Rape Noelle Howey 's article titled " By Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefront an issue that needs to be discussed . Too often it seems that if the act was not violent enough , or if there was any way the woman could have prevented it , then it was not rape . It is time we acknowledge the many different kinds of rape . It is sad that women have to ask themselves if they were raped when they know they did not want to have sex . The definition is what it is . So many women have had sex forced upon them , and the healing afterward never takes place . Howey wrote about a kind of rape that hits home for all the women who do not fall into the category of " random violence , " the kind of rape that needs to be talked about because it is occurring all the time . Thank you , Noelle . TRACY STEPHANOS PHILADELPHIA , PA . " By Any Other Name " is the story of a woman who did n't know how to be firm about what she wanted and then defined it as rape to explain her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she drank too much during dinner and that she was aware there was alcohol in the juice she requested later , but complied with her date 's manipulation anyway . That this man coerced and manipulated her is not to be debated . He is responsible for this , but she is responsible for allowing herself to be manipulated when she was aware it was going on and that it was n't what she wanted . Her actions entailed choices that she needs to be responsible for . It angers me to see women doing this , because they trivialize incidents in which women are powerless . Stories like this represent women as incapable of making decisions . Identifying what is and is n't rape is still an issue-but futile until we start concentrating on the fact that we as women do have choices in situations like the one this author describes . We then need to reaffirm our freedom by taking responsibility for the choices we make , even if the result is n't necessarily something we wanted . AURA J. BROSNAN MADISON , WISC . Medicine of Our Own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " February/March 2001 by Sharon Lerner ) , but it 's important that it also be gender-fair . Until recently , women were excluded from almost all heart disease research . Today , the most heavily investigated strategy for heart disease prevention for women is the use of exogenous hormones . According to gender-specific medicine , heart disease in men is due to genetic or lifestyle factors , while heart disease in women is due to failed ovaries . Healthy midlife women have been urged to take hormones to reduce their risk of heart disease , even though the best evidence shows that they do not reduce this risk . The absurd notion that women are governed by their hormones is alive and well ! Gender-fair research would examine genetic , lifestyle , and hormone factors for women and men . VICKI MEYER EVANSTON , ILL . The Abortion Pill Thanks for Molly M. Ginty 's article " What You Need to Know About RU  --  486 " ( February/March 2001 ) . It was one of the most informative articles I 've read all year . As a gender studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this medical wonder would be all around me . Quite the opposite is true . Until reading your article , I knew little more about mifepristone than that it was commonly called RU-486 or " the abortion pill . " It not only provided its history , price range , and availability , but also info on its possible ability to combat breast cancer and brain tumors . Providing various " battle plans " to keep mifepristone available was also beneficial to an active feminist like myself . Once again , Ms. , a job greatly done . CHRISTINE MUCKLE EVANSTON , ILL .

Sidebar <p>                     @x 1 <p> My eyes must be playing tricks on me . Nina Lawson glanced at the digital clock in the lower corner of her Hewlett-Packard laptop . It was two forty-five in the morning . Yes , her eyes had to be playing tricks on her . She was dog tired after staying up studying for her latest real estate exam , so she knew she should n't put much stock in the email that was blaring at her . She 'd only checked it because she came across it as she was looking for an email from one of her clients . She realized she had n't checked her numbers from Saturday 's drawing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Lottery Commission . <p> She never expected this . <p> " ' The winning lotto numbers for Saturday 's Texas Lotto drawing are **51;571;TOOLONG , ' " she mumbled , reading the email again . <p> Nina 's eyes made their way back down to the little pink ticket clutched tightly in her right hand . 4-7-14-17-21-25 . This was her fifth time comparing the numbers , and the results were still the same . <p> Slowly , any semblance of weariness began to fade away . <p> " Ohmigod , ohmigod , ohmigod . " Nina 's whispers gradually turned into an all-out shout . <p> " I won ! I won ! Yes ! " Nina began screaming as she jumped up from her leather chair , sending it toppling to the floor . She did n't realize how loud she was being until she looked up to see her fiancT , Rick Henderson , standing in the doorway to her office . <p> " What in the world is wrong with you ? " he groggily asked . " You know I have to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still up ? And why are you in here screaming like you 're crazy ? " <p> Nina shook out both her hands , trying to calm herself down . Rick was standing there shirtless , his caramel-colored skin and rippled abs reminding her why he was one of the most soughtafter personal trainers in Houston . They 'd met two years ago , after he whipped her best friend Michelle into shape . He 'd flirted with Nina , telling her how pretty she was and how much she looked like Gabrielle Union . Even so , she did n't give him the time of day because she was married at the time . Then , two months after her divorce , she 'd bumped into him at the gym where he worked . They 'd gone to lunch , and the next thing Nina knew , he was spending every night at her house . <p> Rick was sweet , caring , and the finest man she 'd ever seen . But more than that , he was good to her . After her ex-husband , Todd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love again , but Rick had quickly changed that . Too quickly , her friends said . He 'd moved in with her about six weeks after their first date to help her with her bills , which she 'd been struggling to pay since Todd left . Despite her apprehension about getting involved with someone so soon after her marriage ended , things had progressed quickly . Before she knew it , not only were they living together but they were engaged to be married . <p> " Baby , you 're not going to believe this , " Nina said , bringing her excitement level down a notch . <p> " Do you know what time it is ? " he repeated . " I have a client at five o'clock , Mrs. Brighton . And you know she comes all hyped up and ready to work . " <p> Nina smiled widely . " Well , you need to call Mrs. Brighton and tell her you are n't coming to work out with her tomorrow . Tell her you wo n't ever be working out with her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nina , what are you talking about ? " <p> She had to use everything in her power to contain her excitement . She inhaled deeply , then sauntered over to him , lightly waving the pink ticket in front of him . " This is what I 'm talking about . This little piece of paper is about to change our lives . " <p> " What is that ? " he asked , squinting . <p> " Here . " She excitedly handed him the ticket . " Take a look at this . " <p> He took it but continued to frown as she raced back over to the computer . <p> " Look , girl , I do n't have time to be playing . I need to get some sleep . " <p> " Just gim me a minute . " Nina began reading the computer screen again . " ' The winning numbers for Saturday 's Texas Lotto drawing are **52;624;TOOLONG . ' " She stood up triumphantly and pointed at the ticket . " What do the numbers on that ticket say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers say ? " she repeated . <p> He huffed in frustration , then read the ticket . " **40;678;TOOLONG ... " His eyes grew wide as he looked up at Nina . " Oh , my God . I ... is this for real ? " <p> Nina was grinning like a kid at a chocolate factory as the excitement began building up again . <p> " As real as it gets ! " She could no longer contain herself . She raced over and threw her arms around his neck . " We 're rich , baby . Rich , rich , rich ! " <p> Granted , they were n't married , but he had popped the question out of the blue two months ago . Rick was trying to open his own gym , and he wanted to be financially secure before they actually set a wedding date . He had bought her a small band , with promises to upgrade to a platinum and diamond one as soon as he got his money right . Still , Nina had no doubt that she was sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were definitely ready to marry now . <p> Rick pulled away from Nina , taking a look at the ticket again . Shock was still blasted across his face . " H-how much ? " <p> She kissed him hard . " Sixteen million , " she said , pulling back . " I mean , I did the cash option payout , so I do n't know how much that actually equates to , but I 'm sure it 's somewhere in the millions , even after taxes . " <p> Rick kept staring at the ticket like he could n't believe it . " But how , I mean ... is this for real ? " <p> She nodded . " I would n't play around with something like this , especially at three o'clock in the morning . " <p> " Since when did you start playing the lottery ? " <p> Nina shrugged . " I 'm not a regular player . I just play every now and then . I was in the gas station Saturday and found a five-dollar bill folded up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never in a million years thought I 'd win . " <p> For once Rick was speechless . He was a hustler , so he was always talking a good game . Nina always told him that his gift of gab was so great , he should 've been in sales . <p> Nina took Rick 's hand and led him out of her office , down the hall , and into the living room of their small three-bedroom home , which she 'd moved into after her divorce . <p> " Do you know what this means ? " she said , easing him down onto the sofa . <p> " It means you 're rich ? " he said slowly , like everything was still registering . <p> " It means we 're rich , baby . I can pay off those student loans , get out of debt , open my real estate business , and you  --  you can now finally open that gym you 've wanted to open . " <p> Rick had been scrimping and saving for years to fulfill his dream of opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd managed to save a nice chunk of change , but three months ago , his only brother was killed , and Rick had to use the money to bury his brother . So he was essentially starting all over . <p> A smile finally crossed Rick 's face as his eyes began to twinkle . " We 're rich ? " <p> Nina nodded , matching his smile . " We 're rich . " <p> He jumped up and swung her around in circles as they both let out piercing screams . Nina could n't remember a time she 'd been happier . She knew from that moment forward , their lives would never be the same . <p> Copyright 2009 by ReShonda Tate Billingsley <br> Continues ...
