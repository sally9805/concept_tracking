The RITE and RIGHTS of a SEPARATING SPRING // Newton 's Light // The epitaph czar of Westminster Abbey must have demurred , for the great man 's grave does not bear these intended words . But Alexander Pope did write a memorable ( and technically even heroic ) couplet for the tombstone of his most illustrious contemporary . Biblical parodies , perhaps , could not pass muster in Britain 's holiest of holies , both sacred and secular , * for Pope 's epitome of a life well lived recalled the first overt order of the ultimate boss : // Nature and Nature 's laws lay hid in night : // God said , let Newton be ! and all was light . // Pope surely wins first prize for succinctness and rhyme , but we may cite any number of statements from the wisest of his contemporaries to the best of later scholars , all affirming that something truly // special roiled the world of seventeenth-century thinkers , changing the very definitions of knowledge and causality , and achieving a beginning of control over nature ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries had not attained or , for themost part , even sought . Although hard to define , and even denied by some , this transforming period has been awarded the two ultimate verbal accolades by a generally timid profession of academic historians : the definite article for uniqueness , and uppercase designation for importance . Historians generally refer to this watershed of the seventeenth century as the Scientific Revolution . // To cite a key contemporary , a poet rather than a scientist , at least by current disciplinary allocations that would not then have been granted or conceptualized in the same way , John Dryden wrote in 1668 : // Is it not evident , in these last hundred years ( when the Study of Philosophy has been the business of all the Virtuosi in Christendome ) that almost a new Nature has been revealed to us ? That more errors of the School that is , of the medieval scholastic thinkers and followers of Thomas Aquinas , generally called Schoolmen have been detected , more useful Experiments in Philosophy have been made , more Noble Secrets in Opticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those credulous and doting Ages from Aristotle to us ? So // true it is that nothing spreads more fast than Science , when rightly and generally cultivated . // To cite one of the twentieth century 's most celebrated philosophers , A. N. Whitehead claimed , in Science and the Modern World , that " a brief , and sufficiently accurate description of the intellectual life of the European races during the succeeding two centuries and a quarter up to our own times is that they have been living upon the accumulated capital of ideas provided for them by the genius of the seventeenth century . " // A broader range of views could be cited among historians of science , but few would deny that truly extraordinary changes in concepts of natural order-changes that we continue to recognize today as the familiar bases of modern sensibilities-occurred in seventeenth-century Europe , leading to the enterprise that we call " science , " with all attendant benefits , travails , and transformation in our collective lives and societies . // In 1939 , Alexander Koyr ? , the dean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation as a " veritable ' mutation ' of the human intellect . . . one of the most important , if not the most important , since the invention of the Cosmos by Greek thought . " The Scientific evolution , according to the eminent historian Herbert Butterfield ( 1957 ) , " outshines everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces the Renaissance and Reformation to the rank of mere episodes , mere internal displacements , within the system of medieval Christendom . " And , in 1986 , historian of science Richard S. Westfall stated : " The Scientific Revolution was the most important ' event ' in Western history . . . . For good and for ill , science stands at the center of every dimension of modern life . It has shaped most of the categories in terms of which we think , and in the process has frequently subverted humanistic concepts that // furnished the sinews of our civilization . " // In the cartoonish caricature of a " one-line " primer , the Scientific Revolution boasts two philosophical founders of the early seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // observational and experimental methods , and the Frenchman Ren ? Descartes ( 1596-1650 ) , who promulgated the mechanical worldview . Galileo ( 1564-1642 ) then becomes the first astoundingly successful practitioner , the man who discovered the moons of Jupiter , rearranged the cosmos with a raft of additional telescopic defenses of Copernicus , and famously proclaimed that the " grand book " of nature-that is , the universe- " is written in the language of mathematics , and its characters are triangles , circles , and other geometrical figures . " ( Galileo 's status as martyr to the Roman Inquisition-for he spent the last nine years of his life under the equivalent of " house arrest , " following his forced recantation in 1633-also , and justly , enhances his role as a primary hero of rationality . ) But the culmination , both in triumphant practice and in fully formulated methodology , resides in a remarkable conjunction of late-seventeenth-century talent , a generation epitomized and honored with the name of its preeminent leader , Isaac Newton ( 1642-1727 ) , who enjoyed the good fortune of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most notably Robert Boyle ( 1627-1691 ) , Edmund Halley ( 1656-1742 ) , and Robert Hooke ( 1635-1703 ) . // As with all caricatures based on simplistic historical models of accreting " betterness " ( whether by smoothly accumulating improvement or by discontinuous leaps of progress ) , and on false dichotomies of a bad " before " replaced by a good " after , " this description of the Scientific Revolution can not survive a careful scrutiny of any major aspect of the standard story . To cite just two objections with pedigrees virtually as long as the conventional formulation itself : First , the break between the supposedly benighted Aristotelianism of medieval and Renaissance scholarship , and the experimental and mechanical reforms of the Scientific Revolution , can be recast as far more continuous , with many key insights and discoveries achieved long before the seventeenth century , and abundantly transmitted across the supposed divide . In an early rebuttal that became almost as well known as the basic case for a discontinuous revolution , the French scholar Pierre Duhem , in the opening years of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precursors . Here Duhem argued that several cornerstones of the Scientific Revolution had been formulated by Aristotelian scholars in fourteenth-century Paris , and had also become sufficiently familiar and accessible that even the formally ill-educated Leonardo , albeit the most brilliant raw intellect of his ( or any other ) age , sought out and utilized this work , often struggling with Latin texts that he could only read in a halting fashion , as the foundation for his own views of nature . ( Duhem developed his thesis under a complex parti pris of personal belief , including strong nationalistic and Catholic elements , but his predisposing biases , although markedly different from the a priori commitments of historians who built the conventional view , can not be labeled as stronger or more distorting. ) // Second , and in an objection close to the heart of my own persona and chosen profession , the conventional view does seem more than a tad parochial in its nearly exclusive focus on the physical sciences , and upon the kinds of relatively simple problems solvable by controlled experiment and subject to reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of natural history , which underwent equally // extensive and strikingly similar changes in the seventeenth century , // but largely without the explicit benefit of such experimental and mathematical reconstitution ? Did students of living ( and geological ) nature merely act as camp followers , passively catching the reflected beams of victorious physics and astronomy ? Or did the Scientific Revolution encompass bigger , and perhaps more elusive , themes only partially and imperfectly rendered by the admitted triumphs of new discovery and discombobulations of old beliefs so evident in seventeenth-century physics and astronomy ? ( Because these questions intrigue me , and because my own expertise lies in this area , I shall choose my examples almost entirely from this neglected study of the impact of the Scientific Revolution upon natural history. ) // I derived much of the framework , and many of the quotations , for this opening section from the long and excellent treatise of H. Floris Cohen ( The Scientific Revolution : A Historiographical Inquiry , University of Chicago Press , 1994 ) , a work not so much about the content of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians . Cohen locates much of the difficulty in defining this episode , or any other major " event " in the history of ideas for that matter , in the complex and elusive nature of change itself . We encounter enough trouble in trying to define and characterize the transformation of clear material entities-the evolution of the human lineage , for example . How shall we treat major changes in our approach to the very nature of knowledge and causality ? Cohen writes : " To strike the proper balance between a perception of historical events as relatively continuous or relatively discontinuous has been the historian 's task ever since the craft attained maturity in the course of the nineteenth century . " The Scientific Revolution becomes so elusive in the enormity of its undeniable impact that Steven Shapin , something of an enfant terrible among conventional academicians , opened his iconoclastic , but much respected , study ( The Scientific Revolution , University of Chicago Press , 1996 ) , with a zinger rich in wisdom within an apparent self-contradiction : " There was no such thing as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // We may epitomize the fundamental nature of an episode so fecund in scope and effect , albeit so difficult to characterize , by citing any preferred motto or metaphor in the tradition of " crossing the Rubicon " or " opening Pandora 's box . " Something tumultuous , permanent , and revolutionary , both for the history of society and the history of ideas , occurred during the course of the seventeenth century . And we may epitomize this extended " event " as the birth pangs and adequate initial development of what we call " modern science , " with all its practical consequences for technology , and its intellectual implications for our definition and understanding of " reality " itself . Something happened . Something very big indeed , yet something that we have still not integrated fully and comfortably into the broader fabric of our lives , including the dimensions-humanistic , aesthetic , ethical , and theological-that science can not resolve , but that science has also ( and without contradiction ) intimately contacted in every corner of its discourse and being . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships between science and these other magisteria of our full being-in this case , and for this book , the interactions between science and the humanities-we would do well to begin at the beginning of modern science , by trying to understand how the // seventeenth-century initiators of the Scientific Revolution understood their task , their challenges , their enemies , and their accomplishments . ( I discussed the other great pseudo-conflict , the supposed struggle between science and religion , in a previous book , Rocks of Ages , Ballantine , 1999 . ) How , in particular , did these // creators of modern science construe the traditional disciplines of humanistic study ? How , in even more particular ( and to foreshadow a primary theme of this book ) , did the perception of certain humanistic modes of study as impediments to be swept aside , rather than as allies to be cultivated , set an unfortunate , if understandable ( and probably unavoidable ) , initial context for interaction ? Why does this notion of inherent conflict continue to flourish , literally centuries after the growth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and philistinism ? Perhaps a new kid on the block must be scrappy , vigilant , and predisposed to a taxonomy of us against them . But a prosperous and victorious adult should welcome both the moral and the practical obligations of generosity . // My motivation to write this book stems largely from a personal sense of puzzlement . From earliest memories ( once I passed through to reality and admitted that I would never occupy center field in Yankee Stadium as a professional address ) , I wanted to become a scientist " when I grow up " - in particular , once I learned the technical term for folks who study fossils full time , a paleontologist . I could cultivate no immediate family member as mentor or role model , for my closest relatives possessed smarts in abundance , but had not enjoyed access to higher education and professional life . I always loved , for reasons of personal pleasure rather than any " ought " of class or culture , several areas of what traditional taxonomy calls the arts and humanities-from the largely passive delights of reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( beats the hell out of birdwatching , if you ask me , for those of a taxonomic bent , as buildings stay put and do n't need to be seen at 6:00 a.m. or some other odd time better spent elsewhere ) ; to serious and active participation , still continuing , in choral singing . // I never sensed any conflict among these passions ; after all , I seemed reasonably well integrated , at least in my own head and being ( my hedgehog side ) . Indeed , in the naively narcissistic way of childhood , I imagined myself as a perfectly reasonable common denominator of all these activities ( my foxy interests ) . Moreover , lacking direct or familial experience , I did n't even know that science was supposed to conflict with , or even be substantially different from , the arts and humanities . // I did learn the conventional taxonomies later , but they never made any sense to me . I do acknowledge , of course , the historical reasons for conflict-and much of this book , including these opening sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also understand that basic pursuits of the sciences and humanities often differ intrinsically and logically , so much so that the techniques of one domain frequently can not , in principle , answer the questions of the other . //
