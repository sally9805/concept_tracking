Headnote Mississippi artist Philip R. Jackson 's unconventional still lifes ask viewers to see the beauty in everyday objects . by James A. Metcalfe By casting ordinary items-a bunch of grapes , a broken egg with its ragged shell , a rustic teapot-in a bit of theatrical mayhem and bathing them in enticing light , Philip R. Jackson beckons viewers to reconsider the beauty we too often overlook in our daily lives . This Mississippi resident believes that the world of advertising and pop culture permeates our society in a way that ultimately numbs our senses and prevents us from appreciating the simpler things . He also feels strongly that his role as an artist is to present " a time away from that world where we can put our individual complications on hold long enough to experience a sense of solitude , relaxation , and enjoyment , " he explains . The element of theatre in Jackson 's work helps him achieve this vision and is what he calls " a vehicle to speak dramatically about these overlooked values of simple , funny , absurd , awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what qualities must a subject possess in order to catch Jackson 's eye ? " Something new , something old , something inventive , " says the artist . When he approaches a piece , he usually does so with a definite concept in mind . Jackson insists that his first requirement for a still life is aesthetic , " a formal balance of composition , color , and space . Second , the concept must speak to me . Whether it 's calm , invasive , or humorous , I look for something that , in the end , will elicit a strong reaction from the viewer . " After considering the focus of the piece , Jackson chooses objects from his personal collection of manmade items for their distinct characteristics , such as size , shape , texture , and color . The artist selects objects that offer strong contrasts between the manmade and the natural since , he says , " They must capture the environment in which we live . For example , I am fascinated when I look over the dinner table and see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car window and see trees and telephone poles juxtaposed . Overall , our daily interaction with such things creates an odd , but normal , existence because of the common role they play . " In his early work , Jackson 's interest was purely perceptual-how light defines form . But , as he began to experiment with various ways of arranging his objects , he says , " I began to see a rare connection in which objects seemed to build tension and communicate . " He appropriately tided this series the Tension Series . " I began exploring visual tension , the contrast of one object to another , their body language , and the weight or weightless qualities they posed , " the artist explains . His painting The Mighty Goldfish Cracker was the first in this series and actually happened by accident . " I had placed a Delftware vase in my light box along with a few other objects and took a break to have a snack : Goldfish crackers . I accidentally dropped one of the crackers in the box and left the room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewel . That moment clicked , and it was then that I really started to play with the idea of balance , giving the Goldfish cracker greater strength by outweighing the vase . " Although Jackson is a firm believer in the natural process of observation , he also knows that , above all , he is creating an illusion , and for the sake of the visual experience , there are times when decisions have to be made to sacrifice reality . " In my painting Balancing Grapes , " the artist explains , " I attempted to create an intimate conversation between objects that , by association , are polar opposites but , by gesture , have a connection between them . The teapot is more of a masculine object-hard-edged , geometric , and manmade ; the grapes are more feminine-delicate , full of life , and natural . Since I believe opposites attract , the connection is the point where both objects meet , almost as if the teapot is embracing the hand of a lovely woman . A union is formed , and the image becomes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest illusion in painting is creating a sense of space . " In my work , " he stresses , " I want to create a sensation that convinces the viewer of the air between the objects and the infinite space in which the objects are placed . I am suggesting that it is n't the time or place that is significant but the space between the viewer and the painting , an attempt to connect the viewer to an imaginable space . " He notes that developing the sensation of atmosphere in his work takes a great deal of layering . " After developing a full monochromatic study , I begin scumbling many layers of complementary tones and rotating layers of warm and cool shifts to describe both the objects and background , " he explains . " I continue this throughout the entire process , making sure both the object and atmosphere have the right consistency of paint application and color contrast in creating the best representation possible . " When painting the first background layer , I usually begin with a hue that will contrast with a dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Balancing Grapes , in particular , Jackson chose the first hue to be a very intense red-violet . " I used very thin coats of paint with very loose brushwork , " he says . " In the next few layers , I used multiple complementary neutral tones of red and green , interchanging them between each layer . This is part of the process that creates the pockets of atmosphere . Until this point I had been using low-key tones . I then began to bring in layers of middle-key to high-key tones , which set up the sense of light for the background . I used very little paint and mostly drybrushing for this technique , allowing the underpainting to be seen through the veil of light . " I was especially concerned with the distinction of touch between both objects in this painting , " the artist continues . " The grapes were a bit more complicated because of the many facets of reflected light shining through them . I chose an indirect approach , treating the paint with a fluid application to give the grapes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposing teapot I applied the paint more directly , drybrushing the layers more as a modulated tone , starting from a middle-key tone and constantly building the contrast of the reflections and highlights . " In Delicate Impact , the artist included objects that are normally used as working ingredients for something more " beautiful and tasty . " During the process , Jackson became less interested in the final product and much more intrigued by the ingredients left after their use . " I wanted to create a playful connection between the objects by taking them away from their restricted purposes . Although they provide us protein and tickle our taste buds , when have we really given thanks for what we have ? I guess this work is a plea to look closer and observe the beauty in the commonplace . I want to encourage a break from our rigorous schedule to reconsider the value of life . " Jackson 's major technical challenge with painting Delicate Impact was giving individual treatment to each of the three surfaces . " The eggshells had a very matte finish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he states . " I painted them with very thin , dry glazes , subtly building the form first by establishing the source of light , then adding reflective qualities last . " For the butter he used a thicker body of the paint to enhance its solid form , and he finished it with wet-in-wet glazes to bring attention to the slickness of the surface . " It was challenging to make the blue color of the dish really feel like a blue glaze on something ceramic , " he admits . " I tried to paint it as if I were putting the glaze on the dish , and once I revealed the color that bled into the surface of the porcelain , it became successful . " Jackson believes that the second greatest illusion in painting is convincing the viewer of the physical weight of an object . " By this I mean making a decision based on the qualities of a physical mark ( thick vs. thin ) , opacity of the mixture ( opaque vs. translucent ) , and tonal shift that is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the first mark applied works , but usually there are more that are n't working even after several attempts . Although the many mistakes it takes to get to the right touch seem endless , the viewer is invited to see the inner workings of process , the harmony between each stroke . It also creates a bond between the viewer and the painting by revealing the human touch . I am always reminding myself that I am trying to create something three-dimensional on a two-dimensional surface . This is by far the most challenging obstacle , and I believe the only way to truly achieve this is from observation . " Creating the texture of an object is often misleading when converting the real to the observed , " Jackson continues . " I have found that an object needs to be broken into several segments : the core shadow , the highlight , and the reflected light , which is a starting point to see the form . As I advance the painting , I continually reduce those sections into smaller segments to identify the character of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object , it is easy to overlook and generalize , but maintaining the integrity of the painting by re-evaluating and readjusting to each part proves to be more convincing . " The painting Broken Yolk-wherein the artist posed a dramatically lit broken egg and yolk as a metaphor for tragedy and hope-was one such work that challenged Jackson to convincingly portray the subject 's character . " The color throughout the yolk and its powerful reflection onto the eggshell was so amazing , " he says , " but very difficult to translate into a painted surface . I became convinced I needed to approach the painting from a different angle . " He began by developing a local-color study to work out his technical issues of form and then determined a consistent source of light . " Once the first layer was dry , I worked a few transparent glazes of color with a higher volume of medium into the mixture of paint . The layers of paint acted as sheets of liquid weaving on top and through one another , which solved my problem . I began to treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . " Jackson , who for the most part works with oils , readily admits that he takes most of his color and design roots from the minimalists such as Piet Mondrian and Mark Rothko . " Although my paintings deal with high contrast , " he says , " I develop them on an extremely tonal level . I focus on a neutral palette to divide the space , giving the eyes a break to relax before examining another intense or chromatic tone . My neutral tones are from full-color custom blends ranging from warm to cool , and I rarely use black . " This tonal approach also helps Jackson achieve dramatic lighting . " The role of light is probably the most important and inviting element about my work , " Jackson admits . " I see light not only as a means to reveal form but also as a metaphor-revealing grace as the element uniting everything into one . " Jackson credits the great classical painters Chardin , Pantin- La tour , Joseph Decker , and Walter Murch for inspiring this part of his process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction of paint application as well as palette choices , but all shared the relationship of how light defines form , " the artist says . " As a contemporary realist painter , I try to carry that same quality of intimate observation , also redefining the commonplace . " Sidebar Jackson 's Materials Palette Old Holland oils in the following colors : * cadmium red light * cadmium red medium * cadmium yellow light * cadmium yellow medium * ultramarine blue * cobalt blue * permanent green * titanium white * zinc white * numerous custom-made neutral mixtures Surfaces * Masonite panels Brushes * Utrecht Manglon synthetic brushes Medium * Gamblin alkyd painting medium Setting the Stage To help achieve his dramatic still-life setups , Jackson built a custom box resembling a theatrical stage replete with controlled lighting , backdrop capabilities , and a reflective surface . " Most of my setups require a careful touch in arranging the objects-they usually are n't so cooperative staying in a perfect balance , " he admits . " Often I use string to hang objects or kneaded erasers to hold things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my custom stage , I utilize several lights on a track to create various directions of shadow and reflection . I then document my setups using a digital camera , and once I have taken a number of shots from different angles , I bring the images into Photoshop to finalize the composition and make color corrections . " From that point he uses both the computer screen and the actual setup from life to use as reference while painting . Sidebar www.myAmericanArtist.com If you enjoyed this article on Philip R.
