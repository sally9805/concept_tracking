" We want the Funk ! Give us the Funk ! " No , you 're not at a George Clinton concert . That 's the sound of a raucous PGA Tour gallery when undersized underdog Fred Funk is in the field . How did Fred Funk , a 49-year-old who is unable to pound the requisite long drives that make fans delirious , become one of the most popular players on Tour ? Passion . In a sport where the top players often resemble automatons programmed solely to hit golf balls ( which admittedly is n't bad work if you can get it ) , Funk plays with unbridled emotion . And the fans love it . We caught up with Grandmaster Funk to ask him what it 's like to get more cheers than Tiger , what his future holds and whether he really is having that much fun out there . With your win at the Players Championship in March , you 're now exempt on the PGA Tour through 2010 , when you 'll be 54 years old . Can you see yourself competing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no idea . My goal is to make the Ryder Cup team next year . After that , who knows ? I really see myself making an eventual full-time switch to the Champions Tour , because I feel like I can really help their tour a lot . They need guys like me and Jay Haas and Peter Jacobsen . Guys with name recognition , but more importantly , guys who can get out there and excite the crowds . When I 'm playing well , that 's what I do best . I really enjoy acknowledging the crowds . And I feed off it . A lot of pros hide that emotion and keep the crowd at arm 's length . Why are you different ? The problem with golf is that we 're all told to be flat-liners . You do n't want to get too high when you 're playing well , and you definitely do n't want to get too low . This is what we 're taught by all these psychologists . It 's a game where you try to keep your emotions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy my good shots , which is the opposite of current logic . Instead of expecting to hit good shots , I want to really enjoy them when I do . And instead of ignoring bad shots , I expect to hit them , and when I do , I just say to hell with them . On to the next shot . When did you come up with that theory ? At Hazeltine in ' ' 02 at the PGA Championship . I remember playing with Tiger on Sunday , walking up 11 , and hoping we had a 36-hole day because I was having so much fun . I did n't want it to end . That had never happened to me before . It 's usually with Sunday pressure you ca n't wait to get to the house . But I could n't wait to get to the next shot . And I really enjoyed the atmosphere of being with Tiger . You know , he brings his own circus , everybody following him , cheering for him . Well , they were cheering for me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy I 'm playing with get more cheers than me . This is pretty cool . " And that was even more cool to hear him say it was cool . I ca n't say Tiger and I are close friends , because I do n't hang around with him , but he 's a great guy . And I would like to get to know him more . One of your Funkiest moments came at that PGA . Tiger chipped in for a big par save and gave the crowd his signature fist pump . You then sunk a par putt and followed it with your own mock fist pump celebration . Did Tiger take offense to that ? No , not at all . He thought I was nuts . He laughed about it and said , " What are you doing ? " I said , " Tiger , I was going to do this yesterday , but I did n't time it right . " So the next day , he starts messing up the first hole , hits it right , then chunks it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But now I 'm thinking , this is perfect , I 've got this eight-footer . I 've got to make this thing , and then I can do it . Because he was all pumped up already . And I tell you , that was one of the most pressure putts I 've ever had , because I knew I was going to do it if I made the putt . So I had this whole thing planned out , and I 'm thinking , " I better not miss this . " Is golf a business to you , or is it more a hobby that pays extremely well ? It 's a job . But when you 're playing well , it feels more like a hobby . When you 're not playing well , it 's a real job . When you 're spending a lot of money on travel and things like that and you feel like you 're not getting your just rewards for the work you put in , then you feel like you 're getting run over by a freight train . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here pretty bad . But when you are playing well , you must pinch yourself each morning to make sure you 're not dreaming . Not every morning . I 'm 49 years old , and I bruise easy . No , seriously , I really do appreciate where I 've come from and what I 've done . And to think that I 've had this much success out here at this age and stage of my career is baffling at times . Everything points in the direction that I should not be doing what I 'm doing . The competition has gotten stronger , and the golf courses are getting longer . On top of that , I have n't been able to take advantage of the newest golf ball technology . I do n't hit it hard enough . What 's your swing speed ? I 'm anywhere from 106 to 113 mph Depends on what machine I 'm measured on . Ball speed I 'm about 156 mph . During this year 's U.S. Open , they had a launch monitor out on the second hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 165 mph ball speed . I 've never had that much . So I do n't know what was going on . You were n't swinging out of your shoes ? Well , I 'm always trying to swing out of my shoes . That just never translated into more ball speed . Do you think championship setups are getting out of control in terms of length ? These young guys are hitting the ball a mile . So they need to do something . But instead of changing the design of the hole , they just add length . New tees . To me that 's just dumb . Ironically , our best golf courses are some of our shorter ones . Westchester , Harbour Town . You know , shotmakers ' golf courses . Those are the ones I can excel on . And I usually like golf courses like that , where if you break 70 , you get rewarded . You do n't have to shoot 63 or 64 . You go out there and shoot 68 or 69 and you feel like you 've picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Open this year , did n't it ? Oh , man , that was tough . I mean , if you broke 70 there , you really picked up ground . I shot 70 the last day and moved up 30 spots . That 's an extreme example of toughness though . Tell us about your win at the 2005 Players Championship at Sawgrass . That was the defining moment in my career . Against the strongest field we have all year , no question , including the majors . And it 's on a really tough golf course . I played 32 holes on Monday , under some really extreme conditions . Guys had to put up with that wind all day , and deal with the rough . I live there , and if you have a day like that , you do n't go out and play . You 're not even going to hit balls in it . So it felt really good to come out on top . Did it mean more to win at home ? When you have a group of people really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my loyal Funk 's Punks were at the Players , it 's a lot of fun . Can you imagine if Jason Gore was winning coming down 18 at the U.S. Open , how wild that place would have been ? I did n't make it easy for me or easy for them to watch , you know , with a couple three putts and missing all kinds of shots down the stretch . But I really wanted to give them something to cheer about . And I got it done . My family and all my hometown people were watching . So that was cool . What a special feeling . Your putt to win at 18 was n't exactly a gim me , was it ? Oh , no . They measured it at five feet . But it looked a lot longer than that . Are you really having as much fun as it looks ? I try to . But I also really push myself . In one way I pinch myself for what I 've done , but I still expect a lot of myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're grinding ? Yeah , I 'm definitely grinding . I 've got to work hard out there . Because I do n't hit the ball that far . And today 's game , like every other sport , has become a power and speed game . Guys are just better and better athletes . On top of that , we have these ridiculous technologies that allow these guys to really take advantage of their athleticism . I tell you , I ca n't imagine how fun this game would be if I could hit the ball 30 or 40 yards farther . You would n't get me off a golf course . I would play all day every day and night . You see these guys like Hank Kuehne and Tiger Woods and they can just overpower any golf course . And it would just be so fun to hit a golf ball that hard and watch it fly . I could play a hole any way I wanted . Super conservative or really aggressive . I think that if a lot of guys had to play the golf courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my second shots into the green , and have the success that I 've had out here , they 'd appreciate me even more . It 's surprising that equipment companies have n't been able to match a ball or create a ball that fits your swing speed . You do n't exactly swing like an old grandma . No , it 's not slow . But what happened was , this generation of golf balls  --  the original Pro V1 and the original HX ball from Callaway  --  changed things . There were three guys over 300 yards and 13 guys over 290 the year before the new balls came out . The next year , it was 13 guys over 300 and 65 guys over 290 . The gains were just unheard of . And you kept hearing it up and down the range from all these guys with high swing speeds . And I do n't even know what the threshold is . Maybe it 's 115 mph-plus . They were saying , " Yeah , I got this new ball and I picked up 15 yards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards in the air . " And I 'm going , " All they did was switch balls ? " So I got this ball , and I picked up like two yards . Why did n't you see those gains ? To get the true benefit of these golf balls , you need to have a certain ball speed . Mine is somewhere under 160 mph . And you have guys like Tiger who are extreme examples at 180 mph . But you get into the 165 to 170 range , and these balls just do n't come down . I mean , I 've had ideal numbers according to the computer , but I do n't get those benefits . I 'm maxed out . You seem to be doing pretty well with what you got . I 'm doing okay , but it was upsetting that nobody made a change to anything but the golf ball when these things came out . And they were getting this huge gain , and I 'm going , " Whoa , where 's my gain ? " I feel like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get it out there . Of course , when I complain about distance to my peers , you know , there 's no sympathy at all . They say , " What are you crying about ? You just won the Players . " Did you always want to be a pro golfer ? No , no , no . I did n't . I played junior golf , but I was doing all the other sports , too . I was a good boxer . I did that for 8 years , until I was 16 . But I just never got big enough . Back then , the Junior Golden Gloves 16 and under was age and weight and then Golden Gloves was just weight . So I said , no , that 's it , I 'm out . I do n't want to fight a Marine Corps guy who wants to kill me and really knows how . So I got out of that . But I did n't really get involved with golf until my late teens . And as far as being good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great . I went broke on mini-tour in ' ' 81 after I got out of college . That was when I thought , " Naw , I do n't want to do this . " So I went home to Maryland , and my coach had been promoted and offered me a job as the coach , and I took it . That was the end of ' ' 81 , early ' ' 82 . Did coaching allow you to play in more tournaments ? When we were n't in season , I was the assistant pro at the university course . And that allowed me to play in a lot of sectional events . That 's when I started to really get good . And I think what really happened was , we played the white tees in most events . I think those years really helped me . Playing the white tees , I got used to shooting really low numbers  --  63 , 64 was what you should shoot from those tees . And I did . And then when we went to the back tees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a comfort level of being way under par . A lot of times , guys get that magic number of even par and then get to one or two under and think , " Oh , man , I 'm under par , " and they panic , instead of thinking , " Okay , I 'm two under , let 's go lower . ' ' " You took some flak last year for deciding to skip the British Open . Do you still think that was the right decision ? My number one goal was to make the Ryder Cup team . So I wanted to do everything I could do to maximize my opportunity to do that . Milwaukee 's a great course for me , which is the week after the British . And I was told that Royal Troon was not great for me . But then with the weather they had over there last year , you know , it was semicalm and dry , I had a bunch of my friends come back and say , " Man , you should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I said , " Well , nobody told me that before . " And I 'm watching it on TV , and I 'm saying , " Why did n't I go ? " So in hindsight , I wish I 'd went . Because I know I would 've enjoyed it . That said , I did make the Ryder Cup team . Where is the game today compared to when you first came out on Tour ? This is a great era . I hope the kids today realize how good they have it . And Tiger 's a big reason we have these purses we have . More than that though , he 's made the game cool . He 's the guy that turned golf into a sport instead of some sort of nerdy thing . It was just never looked at as something that kids wanted to do . But Tiger made it cool to play golf . No one 's ever done that before . You know , Arnie put it on the map , but it was still kind of a rich man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for a long , long time . But then Tiger came out and turned golf on its head . He 's not only the most famous golfer , he 's the most recognized athlete in the world . He 's Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan rolled into one . Straight Arrow Funk 's swing analyzed by Shaun Humphries , Top 100 Teacher , Cowboys Golf Club , Grapevine , Texas Funk is n't a big guy , he 's just 5 ' ' 8 " , but he sure is a straight shooter . And he 's got a very simple swing . Look at his takeaway . His arms and shoulders turn fluidly together and he creates a lot of width in his swing by keeping his arms away from his body . At the top , he 's just shy of parallel , and that tells you right there he 's not going to be bombing it . And he also does n't have an incredible amount of hip turn compared to the big hitters . But it 's a nice smooth sequence from top to bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he hits it . You just know he 's hitting from the short stuff more times than not . 30 Second Bio FRED FUNK Age : 49 Height : 5 ' ' 8 " Weight : 165 lbs - Joined the PGA Tour in 1989 at age 32 - 7 career wins , including the 2005 Players Championship - $2,536,153 in 2005 earnings , eighth on the PGA Tour money list - Member of 2003 and 2005 ( upcoming ) U.S. Presidents Cup and 2004 U.S. Ryder Cup teams - Seven career Driving Accuracy titles in 15 full years on Tour , including his third-straight in 2004 - Entered the 2004 Tour Championship . 10 percent ahead of Scott Verplank in Driving Accuracy and hit one more fairway than Verplank during the week to capture the title at 77.23 to 77.13 percent . - Loves water and snow skiing - One of the first Tour players to have LASIK eye surgery for 20/20 vision Illustration THREE PHOTOS : Monte Isom PHOTO : Monte Isom Fred with wife Sharon , son Taylor ( age 9 ) and daughter Perri ( age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
