BEFORE For some riders , a scratch is a badge of honor . Covering those paint chips would be like erasing your bike 's history . But if you ride steel , you need to protect your frame ASAP , because within a week an exposed section of a steel frame can start to rust . Then your bike will be history . QUICK , MINIMAL TOUCH-UP : This six  --  step touch-up took about 24 hours to paint and dry . If you do n't have the time and value rust-protection over appearance , remove any rust , then dab on some clear  --  coat nail polish . Ten minutes and you 're set . 1 MAKE SURE IT 'S A SCRATCH Many scratches are n't even scratches at all-they 're paint from other stuff , such as furniture , walls or another bike . If you ca n't see metal , rub Turtle Wax automotive compound on the scratch to see if it disappears . If it does n't , or if the area clearly exposes metal , you have a chip to touch up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water and a soft bristle brush . Inspect the entire bike for scratches and chips . Pay close attention to the chainstays and bottom bracket-they 're prone to dings from the chain . 3 REMOVE RUST Scrape away any rust with sandpaper or a small knife or file . Do n't make the chip larger , just keep scraping at the brown and orange crusty stuff until there 's nothing but bright shiny metal showing . Painting over rust wo n't keep it from continuing to eat away at your frame . SAND ONLY RUST : Do n't sand the chipped area except to remove rust Some manufacturers treat frames with a thin phosphate coating that inhibits rust . Sanding a chip without rust until the metal is bright will remove that coating . 4 WIPE CLEAN Clean the area thoroughly with acetone to remove dirt , oil , metal shavings and dust . HOW TO TOUCH UP TITANIUM Titanium does n't have to be painted , but if you really want to touch up a scratch , buff it out with steel wool-if it 's a brush-finish frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame . Sand the area and finish up with a clearcoat of spray paint , but be careful . Titanium bends so much , the clear spray paint could develop cracks later on . 5 PRIME IT Cover the chip or scratch with a primer intended for your frame material . Rust  --  Oleum and similar products work well and are available at any hardware store . FILL IN HOLES : Most scratches and chips have some depth to them , like little potholes . You can use the primer to help fill them nearly to the level of the surrounding paint by applying several coats . Follow the directions on the primer can and wait the appropriate amount of time between coats . DO N'T SPRAY : If the primer you need to use comes in a spray can , shoot some into the lid or another receptacle and use a brush to apply it . Spraying primer or paint can put it in places you do n't want it . And it can drip , which looks nastier than a mere chip . 6 PAINT When the final coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nearly filled , you 're ready to apply the matching touch-up paint . Practice a little before working on your frame to get the feet of the brush , and then apply a series of thin coats to the prepped area . Experiment to see what works ; dabbing can be more effective than brushing . BLEND THE PERFECT PAINT : If you 've scoured the nail-polish aisle and hobby store and still ca n't find a perfect match , buy two or three colors that come close , then mix small amounts up on a separate palate to blend the right color . OVERFILL HOLES : Slightly overfill the chip or scratch , and after it thoroughly dries , wet-sand the area with 800-grit sandpaper to level it . AN INVISIBLE FINISH : Use a light polishing compound from an auto parts store to help blend the old and new paint . If the color 's right , you can get a nearly invisible finish . AFTER For the truly anal-retentive , this paint job is n't finished . The touch-up paint is n't perfectly level with the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out , lightly sand with emery cloth , add another coat of paint , then repeat until it 's smooth . LET THE PROS TAKE IT : If you still ca n't get your bike to look as perfect as you 'd like , strip all the components and ship the frame to one of about a dozen frame refinishers , such as CyclArt ( 760/599-1015 , www.cyclart.com ) , which does seamless airbrush touch-ups for $250-$750 .
