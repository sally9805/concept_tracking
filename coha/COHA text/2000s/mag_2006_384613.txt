THE LATEST TOYS TESTED-ON THE BIKE , ON OUR BODIES , ON THE TRAIL // HOTTEST COMPONENTS 1 . SHIMANO PD-M647 PEDALS HIGHS : The 647 provides the excellent Shimano clipless design in a larger platform-a benefit if you unclip often and ca n't , or do n't want to , get clipped back in immediately . The cage is made of a nearly indestructible resin , which is superior to aluminum in this case because it does n't bend and jam the clipless mechanism if you smash a rock . The binding pops up inside the cage , making it easy to find the toe-claw for lightning-fast entry . That little pop-up trick makes these the easiest Shimano pedals to use . Once clipped in , the Shimanos provide a secure feel with little play from the cleat , and just enough float . Release feel is very mechanical and consistent in most conditions . The open-binding design , introduced three years ago in the 959 pedal , is reasonably mud- and grit tolerant . LOWS : It may be " reasonably mud and grit tolerant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-force slop . PRICE : $115 WEIGHT : 571.5g CONTACT : 949/951-5003 ; shimano.com 2 . RITCHEY PRO Z-MAX MILLENNIUM UST TIRES HIGHS : Combine the amazingly predictable and confident traction of the more-than-decade-old Z-Max tire with UST compatibility and what results is one of the best tires for epic cross-country riding and racing we 've tried . The Z-Max 's oddly shaped knobs look strange but provide exceptional traction in conditions ranging from hardpack to sand ; they 're undone only by peanut-butter mud . Durability is good , and the rounded shoulders make for predictable cornering . LOWS : The UST format is offered in one size only , the 2.1 in . We 'd love to see a 2.35-in. for all-mountain use . Also , the price is high . PRICE : $67 WEIGHT : 758g CONTACT : 650/368-4018 ; ritcheylogic.com 3 . ROCKSHOX SID WORLD CUP FORK HIGHS : Rockshox SID World Cup , the longtime favorite of weight weenies , gets updated for ' 06 with a new , low-friction anodized-finish coating on the upper leg , and new Motion Control damping with PopLoc remote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old lockout , and it provided an efficient platform that 's adjustable for a wide variety of riders and terrain . Once we got the Motion Control dialed in using the tunable Floodgate we needed to use only the handlebar-mounted remote switch to turn it off for the choppiest descents . LOWS : The PopLoc remote adds clutter to the handlebar and 2.56 ounces to the lightweight 2.9-pound fork ; it 's still a flexy flier , so big and/or aggressive riders should take a look at the Reba World Cup instead . PRICE : $880 WEIGHT : 3.06 lb . CONTACT : 213/664-8800 ; sram.com LATEST ACCESSORIES 4 . BLACK BURN SYSTEM X6 LIGHT HIGHS : Blackburn 's unique , new anti-dimmmg circuitry allows you to run this dual-headed light ( one spot beam , one wide beam ) for up to 3.5 hours on full juice , maintaining the same level of light from start to finish . The Luxeon III emitters put out 85 lumens each-the equivalent of a 25-watt halogen-and are much tougher than somewhat fragile HIDs . Use the X6 's dimmer switch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , which will give you a whopping 20-hour burn time . One of the nicest features on the X6 is the hi-tech supercharger that will get you up to full power in just over 4 hours . And it 'll allow you to keep the battery plugged in when not in use without causing any damage , so you 'll always be ready for a night ride . LOWS : Some HIDs are even brighter PRICE : $250 CONTACT : 800/456-2355 : blackburndesign.com 5 . ELITE WIRELESS FLUID PRIMOTRAINER HIGHS : If you 're serious about cross-country or marathon racing , you need to be serious about training . That includes knowing your wattage production , a much more precise measure of output than heart rate . Know your watts in relation to heart rate and you 'll also know when you 're getting fitter as well as when you 're off your game . " Thanks , " you say , " but watt meters are expensive ! " We know , but here 's a wise solution , a trainer with a watt meter built right in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races and . if you 're wise , to do interval training more precisely . This one 's a bit of a splurge ( although we 've seen it for as little as $400 online ) , but it 's got several features we really like : peaks , averages and maximums for wattage and speed , and simulated distance . Because signals are sent wirelessly to a digital readout that clamps to your bike 's handlebar , setup/breakdown is a snap . This is by far one of the quietest trainers we 've ever used ; you can hear your iPod without going deaf while training LOWS : None PRICE : $499 CONTACT : 800/279-3793 ; elite-it.com 6 . LOUIS GARNEAU SPEED TS JACKET HIGHS : Cyclists too often put all their tech dollars into their bikes and not a nickel into what they wear . That 's silly . No matter how great your bike is , it 's no good if your clapped-out clothing makes you too miserable to ride . Want our advice ? Layer , and buy a few excellent pieces that can fit into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model . It prevented more than one soaking during test rides in the rain and on sopping trails , it breathes well and stretches with you so it does n't chafe , and the rip-stop nylon fabric did n't upbraid on tumbles or when smacked by tree limbs on tight singletrack . There are lighter shells , but too often these are roadie-only jackets that 'll shred on the first crash . LOWS : Too warm for summer showers : fabric is noisy . PRICE : $99 WEIGHT : 270g ( M ) SIZES : XS , S , M , L , XL , XXL CONTACT : 800/463-8356 ; louisgarneau.com . HOTTEST COMPONENTS 7 . XPEDO MF-2A PEDALS HIGHS : At 232 grams for the set , you 're getting one light pair of lockins thanks to a magnesium body and hollow titanium spindle . Plus , they 've got all the basics covered like 16-click-adjustable release tension , cartridge bearings and 2 DU bushings , rubber seals , a sturdy aluminum end cap and easy rebuildability . The Posi-Lock retention jaws accept Xpedo or Shimano cleats in equally effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the trail . We 've spent a good deal of time on the Xpedos and continue to be impressed with their flawless function . They have a small body and super light weight so even the gooniest of gram counters will be stoked . LOWS : With a 185-pound rider weight limit your best bet is to leave these pedals to the gnomish XC types . PRICE : $176 WEIGHT : 232g CONTACT : 888/804-1095 ; xpedo.com 8 . SPECIALIZED HOUFFALIZE PRO TUBELESS 1.8 TIRES HIGHS : Touted as a " slightly muddy conditions " tire , Specialized 's 625-gram tubeless Houffalize has a narrow 1.8-in. casing with small , tightly spaced knobs and a soft shoulder compound for sticky cornering . A higher-compound , low-rolling-resistance center tread is used to ensure high speeds . Despite the fact it 's made for tacky soil we used it on hardpack and sand as well with admirable results . It 's a strong contender in the soft but we were more than surprised with its " everywhere " performance . The tread rolled fast and proved to have predictable breakaway in high-speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know exactly what your tire is going to do at certain lean angles . If you are riding exclusively dry and dusty dirt look to the Fast Trak S-Works LOWS : While it works fine in dry , it does n't have any love for extra-rocky trails . PRICE : $42 WEIGHT : 625g CONTACT : 408/779-6229 ; specialized.com 9 . SPEEDPLAY DRILLIUM PEDALS HIGHS : Quite possibly the coolest-looking pedals on the market , the Drilliums feature 20 raised , replaceable pins that provide tons of grip even in thick slop . Their funky concave shape , a perfect echo of the curved outsole of your shoe , offers more comfort and surer grip than a purely flat surface . And they 've got a platform so big that even a flat-foot bozo can love them . LOWS : Clydesdales among us can snap off the pins . WEIGHT : 565g ( claimed ) PRICE : $109 CONTACT : 800/468-6694 ; speedplay.com LATEST ACCESSORIES 10 . CANON SD400 DIGITAL CAMERA HIGHS : Canon has newer point-and-shoot digitals , but the tiny SD400 remains one of our favorites for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modes and two movie modes-with sound ( the new SD430 and 450 are still-photo-only models ) . The 5.3 megapixel files make frameable 8x10 prints , and the low shutter lag means you wo n't miss a shot . The tiny Li-Ion battery on our tester never died , even when shooting snowsports on sub-zero days . LOWS : Image quality is good , but not amazing , particularly at ISO 400 ; if you 're printing , shoot in the highest resolution mode and use photo paper and photo ink . The manual features are nice , but can be difficult to access and use in action-sports settings . PRICE : $300 WEIGHT : 1150g ( w/ battery and SD memory card ) CONTACT : 800/OK-CANON ; usa.canon.com 11 . HIGHGEAR LOFT HRM HIGHS : The Loft features an altimeter , heart rate monitor , barometer , thermometer and watch functions . Mountain goat riders love the maximum and accumulated altitude functions to see how much and how high they 've climbed . Heart rate monitor functions are basic , with sellable high and low zone alarms , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display mode as well . The batteries in both lhe walch and chesl slrap are easily replaceable . We used lhe Loft during a 24-hour event in Colorado to tell us why we were seeing stars , had a hard time breathing and could n't feel our feet-it was in the low twenties , at 9.000 feet , and our heart rate was bouncing off the redline . LOWS : The somewhat large and heavy ( compared to a regular watch ) unit smacked into the back of some riders ' hands on bumpy descents .
