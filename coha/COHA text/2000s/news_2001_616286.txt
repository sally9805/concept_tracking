<p> Compared to the XFL , which started up this year and quickly flamed out , the Women 's United Soccer Association has n't burdened itself with inflated expectations . <p> After its April inaugural game featuring U.S. women 's soccer icons Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain , the WUSA settled into a low-key summertime niche alongside Major League Soccer and the WNBA , which were created in 1996 and 1997 , respectively . <p> The WUSA stamped its first regular season as a general success , but how it proceeds as the novelty wears off could prove to be a more sizable challenge . <p> The eight-team women 's professional soccer league , with a five-year , $65 million investment from five different cable and communications firms , including Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc. and Cox Communications Inc. , has slightly surpassed its initial attendance projections . But it is lagging in television ratings and corporate sponsorships . <p> While those factors are not uncommon for new sports leagues , the sliver of the sports public that the WUSA is trying to reach  --  the largely untapped fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more problematic to hold . <p> " We have proven that we 're a viable league and we have shown that there is a market for women 's soccer , " said WUSA chief operations officer Tony DiCicco , the former U.S. women 's national team coach . <p> How deep that market is and how loyal those fans are is as uncertain as when the WUSA swung into action . <p> At a time when sports-related corporate sponsorships and television ratings for sporting events are falling across the board , the first full-fledged women 's professional soccer league in the world is plunging ahead , convinced that affordable , family-friendly sports entertainment featuring accessible players can work . <p> " If you look at the other recent startups , I 'd give the WUSA an A+ , " said University of North Carolina women 's soccer coach Anson Dorrance , who has won 17 NCAA titles and was the first U.S. women 's national team coach . " You 've got a collection of players who were the original pioneers in this sport . They 've known what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's going to be around for a long time because the salaries are n't over the top . " <p> WUSA players are paid between $25,000 and $85,000 , with 24 U.S. national team players earning the top two salary scales and receiving five-year contracts as its " founding members . " The league likes to boast that players such as Hamm did n't demand exorbitant sums , although her reported endorsement income is well into the six figures . <p> Atlanta Beat striker Charmaine Hooper has earned more money playing in lesser leagues in Norway and Japan over the past decade but says the competition she 's getting here is unbeatable . <p> " It 's better than I thought it would be , " said Canada 's all-time leading goal scorer , who has 12 goals for the Beat . " I thought there would be some dropoff after the international level players . But many of them have done very well . " <p> She does n't make the WUSA maximum because of a lower scale for top international players , who have two contracts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marketable player . " While not begrudging the American stars their cache as WUSA drawing cards , she says she is concerned for players on the lower end of the pay scale , who sign on for just one season . <p> But Hooper said she does n't think the WUSA will encounter labor problems , which happened in the WNBA during collective bargaining negotiations two years ago . WUSA players also seem unlikely to challenge the single entity status of the league  --  which signs and pays players , instead of the teams  --  as several former MLS players have done in the courts . <p> " If the league continues to get more interest ( mainly from additional financial backing ) , then it wo n't come to that , " Hooper said . <p> Without the international contingent , the WUSA surely would have suffered on the field . All four playoff teams  --  the Beat , Philadelphia , New York and Bay Area  --  have relied heavily on their non-American stars . Atlanta 's Sun Wen , who won the Golden Boot award at the 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season , but the Beat has been energized on the attack by Hooper and Japan 's Homare Sawa , along with U.S. star Cindy Parlow . <p> While U.S. players such as Atlanta goalkeeper Briana Scurry , Bay Area defender Brandi Chastain and New York forward Tiffeny Milbrett have excelled individually , the WUSA has revealed that the strength of the popular American team may be more in the sum of its parts . <p> " The foreign players do have a bit of polish because they come from soccer cultures where they live and breathe the game , " Dorrance said . <p> " It 's been great to see the individual skill and flair of some of the foreign players converge with the competitive spirit and attitude of the Americans , " Beat coach Tom Stone said . " Some teams have been better at it than others . " <p> The ones that have n't pulled it off have floundered . Most surprisingly of all is Hamm 's Washington Freedom , which missed the playoffs and finished seventh . Hamm switched offensive roles several times and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking stars . <p> Regular-season attendance averaged 8,103 , slightly higher than the WUSA 's revised target of 7,500 . But Washington and Atlanta , the only teams in the eight-team league to draw better than five figures a game , have pulled up most of that number . The other six teams averaged only 6,600 combined , barely above what the WUSA charted out in the beginning . The other seven teams reported their best or second-highest single-game crowds when Hamm and Washington came to town . <p> Nationally televised games on Atlanta-based TNT have drawn an average of 0.4 ( roughly 400,000 households ) , well below what the cable network had in mind originally in the 0.6 to 0.8 range . But the current numbers are comparable to what MLS draws on ESPN and ESPN2 . <p> " We 're not satisfied that this is the best we can deliver , but it 's a nice start , " TNT Sports president Mark Lazarus said . " This is very much a niche sport , and one that is somewhat underserved . " <p> He said no ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has too few subscribers . The Beat aired nine games on Fox Sports Net , which does n't release ratings figures . <p> The WUSA replaced its top television and marketing official , Lee Berke , early in the season after what was termed a difference of opinion with league CEO Barbara Allen . The league has three national charter sponsors  --  Acuvue , Band-Aid and Hyundai  --  and five league sponsors , most prominently Gatorade , but had hoped to have more on board . During the season , it signed up AFLAC , the Columbus-based supplemental insurance firm . <p> A key component to developing a returning base of support is relentless grassroots community outreach . Like the WNBA , players are obligated to sign autographs after games , and they typically make several public appearances during the week . <p> " If this league is going to set itself apart , this is what we have to do , " said San Diego and U.S. national team captain Julie Foudy . " The WNBA has tremendous resources that we do n't have . Our job is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fazed by the prospect of attendance and TV ratings trickling downward , as has happened in the WNBA and MLS . <p> " Our goal is to get better in every area , " he said . " We need to do a better job in all of our markets and drive up attendance based on rivalries and games and not just personalities . No one 's sitting here saying we can kick back and relax . But I think we 've met some of the objectives we set for the first year . " Mia Hamm 's popularity boosted attendance everywhere she went with the Freedom . / JONATHAN NEWTON / Associated Press Graphic : AVERAGE HOME ATTENDANCE Washington ... 14,421 Atlanta ... 11,092 Boston ... 8,011 Bay Area ... 7,692 Philadelphia .. 7,154 New York ... 5,724 San Diego ... 5,714 Carolina ... 5,255 Graphic : &gt; What : WUSA semifinals. &gt; When , where : 6:45 p.m .
