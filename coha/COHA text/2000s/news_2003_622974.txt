<p> HOW DO WE DEFINE GREAT ART ? <p> Editor  --  OK , I admit I 'm a chicken about the new and original in art ( " Any bright ideas ? " Thursday ) . It took me decades to learn to appreciate art made after 1940 , and I 've been slow to adopt the new in other fields as well , notably music and movies . Newness and originality , for me , are not enough . If your " genius " is appreciated by only six or 6,000 people , then so what ? <p> To me , great art is about recognition , about glimpsing the mysteries of the human heart and mind , about an appeal to the emotions as well as to the intellect , and so greatness necessarily differs for each observer and perhaps even for each observation or reading . I had heard for years that cliche " The hair stood up on the back of his neck , " and said to myself , " Oh , that 's just bushwah . " But standing in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Jose Museum of Art a few years ago , the hair did stand up on the back of my neck . It was an unexplainable shock of recognition , a great and unforgettable experience . <p> None of us alive today can truly determine what artistic works will live beyond our brief span , although there will be some kind of consensus , and some works , maybe like the music of Morten Lauridsen , born 1943 , for instance , will survive and continue to be appreciated . Most of the stuff Steven Winn complains about so thoughtfully will disappear , and we would probably be amazed at what will be considered great a hundred years from now . <p> SUE KEMP <p> Palo Alto <p> TWAIN IS ABRASIVE <p> Editor  --  Contrary to your headline " Shania Twain 's music crafted to be pleasing " ( Jan. 6 ) , I must say that she rubs me , and a lot of the guys I talk to , decidedly the wrong way . For if any self-respecting guy bothered to take his eyes off her and actually listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a very rude awakening . <p> Twain 's message  --  revealed in such mega-hits as " Honey I 'm Home , " " Any Man of Mine " and " That Do n't Impress Me "  --  is one clearly aimed at the figurative groin of the male psyche : empowering women by ridiculing and humiliating men . " Honey , I 'm home . . . fix my dinner . . . rub my shoulders . . . pour me a drink . " " Any man of mine better toe the line . " <p> Her message is as clear as the body stocking she wears in her latest video while riding a motorcycle : Women are on top and calling the shots . That this is becoming ever more the case in our society is doubtless the reason for her mega-platinum success . But must we add insult to injury by having some cowed gent proclaiming her " pleasantness " in your paper ? That 's a little too Orwellian for me . <p> LEN BAKER <p> Berkeley <p> J.LO OVERRATED <p> Editor  --  I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 31 ) . Was n't she in one of the worst movies of all time , " Anaconda " ? She is certainly not pretty enough to get away with awful performances like that ! Has she learned acting since then ? <p> As for her being able to sing and dance , the only reason she and the majority of people in the entertainment world get away with the unbearable , low-level material they present is that the sensitivity of too many people to taste , quality and true ability has been dulled by constant exposure to substandard presentations . I mean , really  --  folks think anything , and I mean anything , is good . <p> Julia Roberts looks like Mr. Potato Head and is quite vulgar , and who told her she could act ? Meg Ryan , another annoying actor ! <p> Where are the Joan Crawfords and Gene Tierneys of our time ? <p> SUNNY SAFIYA <p> Oakland <p> ' FAMILY ' MATTERS <p> Editor  --  Thanks for an excellent introduction to " A Death in an American Family " ( " Loud echoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I totally missed the original " An American Family " and barely recall talk of it ( I was in college and did n't watch TV ) . Why on earth did they show the original episode after the recent one ? <p> KEITH WALL <p> Burlingame <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  I recall how surprised I was when the Louds split . Now I realize that I should have seen it coming  --  for them and millions of others . Same with Lance 's death . <p> JIM CLIFFORD <p> Redwood City <p> PERTINENT WORDS <p> Editor  --  Amid the revival of interest in the works of Herbert Asbury ( " Gangsters of N.Y . vs. thugs of S.F. , " Dec. 30 ) , critics seem to have forgotten the important article he wrote in 1946 for H.L. Mencken 's American Mercury , " When Prohibition was in flower . " The article was primarily a lighthearted description of the antics of Izzy Einstein and Moe Smith , two Prohibition agents who pursued Demon Rum through all the boroughs of New York during the 1920s . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of the effects of America 's 15-year-long " noble experiment " with alcohol prohibition , should be read and reread today in the light of the nation 's century-long " noble experiment " with drug prohibition . Here is Asbury 's analysis : " Prohibition went into effect throughout the United States on Jan. 16 , 1920 , and the country settled back with an air of ' Well , that 's settled . ' There had been a liquor problem . But a law had been passed . Naturally , there was no longer a liquor problem . No prophet arose to foretell the awful things that were coming  --  the rum ships prowling off the coast , the illicit breweries and distilleries , the bootleggers and the speakeasies , the corruption of police and judiciary , the hijackers and their machine guns , the gang wars , the multimillionaire booze barons , the murders and assassinations , the national breakdown of morals and manners , and all the rest of the long train of evils that sprang from the 18th Amendment . " <p> WILLIAM M. BURKE <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With reference to C.W. Nevius ' excellent column ( " Runaway media right some of the time , " Jan. 7 ) : Some of the media 's " right moments " include when they are bringing to the fore some of the Bush administration 's actions that are accomplished quietly or secretly : off-road vehicles allowed on abandoned forest roads ; special protection from suits for Eli Lilly ; snowmobiles at Yosemite ; lowering standards on clean water , gas mileage and other environmental restrictions that irritate corporate donors ; and withholding foreign aid because of the inclusion of funds for abortion . <p> Because so many areas of our country are captives of monopoly media that pursue and present the news with a bias , it is terribly important that editors and syndicated columnists monitor and publicize issues that concern the public . By doing so , the media perform a public service that strengthens our democracy . <p> BARBARA SEANEY <p> Menlo Park <p> ARTFUL ESSAY ON SANDER <p> Editor  --  Congratulations to Kenneth Baker on his fine essay on August Sander ( " Unblinking portraits of German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have read about Sander and his work , this short piece  --  including the wonderful lines from Walter Benjamin  --  is surely the smartest and the wisest . I will need to make another trip to the show with your thoughts in mind . <p> PAUL GOLDSTEIN <p> Lillick Professor of Law <p> Stanford University <p> UBIQUITOUS PHIL <p> Editor  --  As a avid moviegoer , I feel it is my civic duty to point out that there is a film loose in the Bay Area without Philip Seymour Hoffman in it . Yes , that 's right . . . " Pinocchio " ! This is , I believe , against the California State Film Law , Sec. 236B , which states , " No motion picture shall be shown in the United States that does n't have Philip Seymour Hoffman in it . To do so is a felony . " ( By the way , it 's only a misdemeanor if the film lacks John C. Reilly . ) <p> Oops ! I just realized that " Pinocchio " is one of them foreign films . Whew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities if we spot a movie made without Phil or John  --  that 's the American way . <p> CURTIS LOFGREN <p> Richmond <p> CONSIDER THE MOLE <p> Editor  --  Talk about miscasting ! If they needed a former supermodel for " Celebrity Mole , " should n't they have gotten Cindy Crawford ? ( Think about it a minute . ) <p> NARICH JONES <p> Monte Rio
