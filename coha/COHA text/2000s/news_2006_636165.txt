<p> How much noise does it take to ruin your dining-out experience ? I know people who absolutely refuse to patronize restaurants that are notoriously noisy . <p> A lot of factors go into restaurant noise . The night of the week , for example . Many restaurants are more subdued during the week than on weekend nights . How close is the bar area to the tables ? A raucous bar crowd will send the decibel level up and over the top . And being seated in a booth allows for easier , more private conversation . Also , the level of noise goes up in direct proportion to how close the tables are to one another . Some people like this style of dining , which borders on the communal , but it can be a problem at times . Restaurant owners will say they love a noisy restaurant , and that customers would rather be in a restaurant that is buzzing than one that is quiet . <p> Scoozi on West Huron is a restaurant with approximately 300 seats , so if the restaurant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will not be conversation challenged . On the other hand , if the restaurant is packed ( including bar area , which is open to the dining room ) , you can bet that the patrons ' voice levels will be bouncing off the rafters . <p> Smaller restaurants are not always a safe bet either . At Avec on West Randolph Street you can count on a shouting match to carry on a conversation . The restaurant is about as wide as three bowling lanes , and when the place is full ( most of the time ) it gets nasty noisy . At Avec , though , the patrons are generally under 40 , so it 's rock on . <p> Conversely , A Tavola on West Chicago Avenue , one of my favorite Italian restaurants , has only about 38 seats , but its small size works in its favor . Why is A Tavola conversation friendly ? For one thing it attracts a customer that is a bit older . And the intimacy and serenity of the room builds respect for quiet and polite conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the volume of background music way up there ? When all you can hear above the dining din is a thump , thump , thump , would n't it be a good idea to lose the music altogether ? Just a thought . <p> With all that in mind , here are some area restaurants I recently check out  --  decibel meter in tow  --  and the " noise factor " you may encounter on your next dining excursion . <p> Luxbar <p> 18 E.

Get a seat to the rear of the main dining room and the noise level drops considerably . <p> NOTE : Seating can be a plus or minus 10 , since restaurants often change their seating configuration to accommodate groups or to " tighten " the room . Private party room seating is not included in the seating figure . <p> Pat Bruno is a free-lance writer , critic and author . <p> HOW WE GOT OUR RESULTS <p> Just how much noise is too much noise ? Here are some normal decibel levels for reference : Normal conversation : 60-65 decibels ; rock concert : 110-120 decibels ; Passing motorcycle 90 decibels ; shouting in ear 110 decibels ; ringing telephone 78-80 decibels ; hair dryer 65-90 decibels . Eighty-five decibels and above is considered a possible damage factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in trouble if the decibel level is continuous , and over an extended period of time . <p> For this story , I made lots of use of an electronic decibel meter . The decibel meter is a hand-held device that is about 6-inches long , so it 's small enough to be discreet . Turn it on , and it registers the decibel level on a digital read out screen . The particular model I used can read decibel levels up to 100+ and as low as 60 . <p> Decibels are a logarithmic unit , so you can not add and subtract like ordinary numbers . What this means is that 70 decibels is 10 times as loud as 60 decibels , and 100 decibels has 10 times the effect of 90 decibels.  --  Pat Bruno Color Photo : Dom Najolia/Sun-Times ; Waiter Vasilis Kapoglis ( center ) introduces a bottle of wine to diners Mike Ellis and his guest Rebecca Bisenius at the Greek Islands Restaurant , where you can almost always count on a rousing good time. ; Color Photo : Keith Hale/Sun-Times ; The dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rush , is one of the most bustling in the city .
