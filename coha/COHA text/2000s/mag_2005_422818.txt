HOW ARE WHOOP-DE-DOS FORMED ? Depends which kind . Artificial whoop-de-dos have nothing in common with their natural cousins . The big rollers popular with terrain-park rats occur in nature no more often than rainbow-shaped metal rails . They 're built  --  on purpose  --  by a bunch of dudes shaping and smoothing a flat slope with snowcats and tillers , creating a wave train of symmetrical ridges that are nice for spinning 180s . Natural whoop-de-dos , on the other hand , occur when Satan , standing down in Hell , punches up at the snowpack with his pitchfork . Or so it seems on an undulating path like Snowbird 's Cirque Traverse , or the spine-compressing goat track that is Taos 's High Traverse . But , truth be told , natural whoops  --  like moguls  --  form when skiers ply the exact same route ; their braking and snowplowing form troughs and crests that get more pronounced and harder to avoid with time and subsequent snowfall . Whoop-de-do paths , however , are generally accepted  --  like frostbite or a lousy sex life or cataracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport of skiing . So suck it up . WILL ANY OF THE CURRENT SKI STARS BECOME LEGENDS ? In the ' ' 80s , you could identify the relevant ski heroes  --  Hattrup , Coombs , Cummings  --  by catching the credits of a Greg Stump film . But then Glen Plake and Scot Schmidt made off-piste skiing so cool that freeskiers began sprouting like dandelions . Now , the Doctor ca n't even count all the freeskier cliques on one glove  --  jibbers , big-mountain honchos , X Gamers , expeditioners , freeheel geeks , ski-resort " ambassadors , " and film skiers ( each company has its own posse ) . Still , some current stars will keep shining . Seth Morrison 's signature-model skis , Crayola hair , and catlike acrobatics make him hard to forget . Shane McConkey 's nude back flips , alter ego ( that 's Saucer Boy to you ) , and ski BASE jumps will likely give his celebrity long legs . But , in literal terms , he 'll need a mohawk to ever be as big as Plake . WHY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skis , which can top $1,200 , have no motor and do n't help a hoot with erectile dysfunction . If you escaped shop class with a C-minus and your thumbs , you can build a workable pair of skis in your garage , though it 'd be cheaper if you fired yourself and moved production to China . There 's the rub : Well-made skis are expensive because they require a seamless marriage of materials ( wood , metal , fiberglass ) and design characteristics ( flex , geometry ) that few engineers know well . Each ski length ( 175 , 180 , etc. ) also demands its own mold ( about $80,000 ) . Then there 's the cost of training salespeople , advertising , sponsoring athletes , covering shipping costs , and offering spot-on distribution during a blink-and-you'll-miss-it four-month buying season . According to one analysis , 12 to 15 percent of revenues from skis goes to selling the things . Bottom line : Nobody 's getting rich in the ski trade . So , unless you 're the guy who bought Flake 's Olin Mark IVs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHUTE V. COULOIR : PLEASE EXPLAIN . A couloir ( pronounced KOOL-whar ) is a dreamy , skiable gully . A chute ( shoot ) is , according to mountaineering glossaries , " a very steep gully . " So why is Mammoth 's landmark dubbed Star Chutes , while Jackson Hole 's Corbet 's is a couloir ? The " C " words are similar , but not identical , in the lingua franca of all big mountain athletes . ( FYI , saying " lingua franca " scores Flake filthy amounts of tail . ) Although Americans widely regard " chute " as the English translation of " couloir , " they 're wrong : Couloirs are mountain passages filled with snow or ice that melt and disappear . Chutes , however , can peter out or turn into cliffs  --  which is why Flake prefers couloirs . And because saying " couloir " is also a great way to score tail .
