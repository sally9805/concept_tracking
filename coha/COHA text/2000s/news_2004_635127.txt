<p> CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA <p> When : 8 p.m . Tuesday <p> Where : Symphony Center , 220 S. Michigan <p> Tickets : $14-$109 <p> Phone : ( 312 ) 294-3000 <p> Kent Nagano wants to make it clear that he really does n't hold a half-dozen music director posts stretching from Berlin to Berkeley . <p> It just seems that way for the California-born conductor , who is leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra 's current set of subscription concerts at Symphony Center this week . ( His final performance with the CSO in works by Bruckner , Bach and Schubert is 8 p.m . Tuesday . ) <p> Nagano , 52 , was in the news last month when the Montreal Symphony Orchestra put an end to weeks of rumors and officially announced that he would become the orchestra 's music director starting with the 2006-07 season . In February , the Bavarian State Opera named him to succeed Zubin Mehta as general music director , also beginning in 2006-07 . He is currently music director of the Los Angeles Opera , Berlin 's Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post he has held for more than 25 years . <p> And we thought that Daniel Barenboim , the CSO 's music director , and music director of Berlin 's Staatskapelle , was a man in motion . <p> " There 's been a bit of confusion , at least in Europe , " said Nagano by phone last week from Washington , D.C. , where he was conducting the National Symphony before coming to Chicago for his four CSO concerts . " Until 2006-07 , I stay nearly exclusively involved with the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester and the Los Angeles Opera . There 's no overlap at all . <p> " I know a lot of people thought , ' Holy smoke , ' " he added with a laugh at the speculation that he would be juggling five music directorships on two continents . <p> He will , however , appear with his Berlin orchestra as a principal guest conductor at least through the 2007-08 season until a successor is named . And he expects to continue working with the Los Angeles Opera , which he joined in 2001 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have developed quite a strong and personal partnership with Placido Domingo , " Nagano said . " I 'm sure we 'll find a way to continue working together . " <p> Nagano has been a busy man , winning plaudits for his imaginative programming , but it 's been seven years since he has conducted the CSO . During the worldwide round of musical chairs in the late 1990s when nearly a dozen orchestras from Cleveland to Berlin were on the prowl for new music directors , Nagano 's name rarely surfaced amid the endless speculation about who would end up where . <p> That has changed . He was hardly a dark horse in the search in Montreal , an orchestra that found itself without a music director two years ago after musicians complained publicly about the dictatorial style of longtime music director Charles Dutoit , who stormed off in a fury . American orchestras are desperately looking for the kind of fresh eyes and willingness to think outside the traditional concert format that Nagano has demonstrated in every post he has held , including the top musical jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine years with the Lyon Opera in France during the same period . He has the potential to succeed Barenboim when he leaves the CSO after the 2005-06 season , though accepting the Montreal post probably takes him out of the running . <p> Nagano learned the hard way that an orchestra can not simply coast on past glories when he took over the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester post in 2000 . <p> " Berlin is extremely complicated terrain , " said Nagano , his voice low and speaking in his typically careful , thoughtful manner . " When I arrived five years ago , there were 11 full-time symphonic concert series going on with 11 wonderful orchestras , three of which were the opera house orchestras plus another eight symphonic-only institutions . Each one has traditions and histories that are very , very important . <p> " When I came , problems were exacerbated because the amount of government funding was becoming very strained . It was clear all of the orchestras would be under enormous financial pressure . A few weeks after I arrived , a proposition was put forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It was clear that something was going to have to be done to set the orchestra apart , " he said . " I 've always felt that returning to the foundation of an institution 's tradition is a good starting point . " <p> The Deutsches Symphonie was one of the largest radio orchestras in Germany , formed immediately after World War II by American authorities in the American sector of divided Berlin . Its first musicians were former members of the Staatskapelle , the orchestra of the Berlin Staatsoper , whose music director had been the legendary Wilhelm Furtwangler . ( Barenboim took over the Staatsoper 's top job in 1992 and two years ago cut back to his current post as music director of the Staatskapelle . ) <p> " After the wall came down , to represent a united Germany , the Radio Orchestra became the German Symphony Orchestra , " Nagano said . " The radio aspects of the orchestra were sharply diminished , and it became much more of a symphonic concert orchestra . <p> " In choosing repertoire , we developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furtwangler years . And we also made a strong reference to our radio roots , which means an involvement and responsibility to music written today . " <p> Nagano takes a long view in planning concerts , trying to set up a coherent dialogue between an ensemble 's tradition and contemporary music over a period of three to five seasons . But one work that the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester commissioned under his watch , a version of Brahms ' iconic " German " Requiem with additional material by contemporary composer Wolfgang Rihm , illuminates the fresh ideas he brings to standard repertoire . ( He conducted the work in Washington with the National Symphony earlier this month . ) <p> " The Brahms Requiem is challenging to perform because , at least in Berlin , it 's so beloved it 's performed eight to 10 times every year , " he said . " We have to do everything we can to fight against falling into a routine when performing it . The words chosen by Brahms are so universally meaningful that the very idea that they could become routine is terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interspersed among the requiem 's seven sections . Austere but expressive , they " offer time to pause and reflect upon the text and the meaning of the words we have just heard , " Nagano said . <p> Brahms pieced his Requiem together from fragments of scripture between 1854 and 1868 , and the work went through several incarnations before finally coalescing into its final shape . Since Brahms tinkered with the work so extensively , Nagano felt comfortable adding Rihm 's interludes . <p> " That fragmented history and the history of making additions was the key to explain why further additions could even be thought of , " he said . <p> Nagano is just beginning to research the traditions of the Montreal Symphony and mulling ways to underscore its distinctive profile . Nagano has a penchant for thoroughness , so it could be exhausting work , but he does n't see it that way . <p> " It 's exciting , it 's inspiring , " he said . " It 's the love of music you can feel , that does n't need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the scholastic bits , the semantics . At the very primal level , what is most meaningful is how it communicates on a human level . " <p> Nagano 's love of music was nourished at home on a farm along California 's central coastline where he grew up with his parents and three sisters and brothers and in the local public schools . He started conducting in college at the University of California at Santa Cruz and San Francisco State University , when friends who were composition students asked him to round up some student musicians and conduct their works . <p> He does n't share the perception of so many in the orchestral world that audiences , especially in the United States , are interested only in familiar repertoire and consider contemporary music bitter medicine . <p> " I never really think about whether a work is new or not , " he said . " It 's more a matter of making sure that the curiosity we 're all born with is nourished and encouraged , especially when it 's linked to an uncompromised standard of quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music education in American public schools , the fact that recent generations have grown up without wide exposure to the arts . But he is ultimately optimistic . <p> " I 'm an American , and I do feel that it 's a part of our American culture to look toward the future and to do so with an open mind . That 's part of our heritage of being the new world . "
