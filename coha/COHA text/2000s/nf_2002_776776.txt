THE HIDDEN CULTURE OF AGGRESSION IN GIRLS // The Linden School campus is nestled behind a web of sports fields that seem to hold at bay the bustling city in which it resides . On Monday morning in the Upper School building , students congregated languidly , catching up on the weekend , while others sat knees-to-chest on the floor , flipping through three-ring binders , cramming for tests . The students were dressed in styles that ran the gamut from trendy to what can only be described , at this age , as defiant . Watching them , it is easy to forget this school is one of the best in the region , its students anything but superficial . This is what I came to love about Linden : it celebrates academic rigor and the diversity of its students in equal parts . Over the course of a day with eight groups of ninth graders , I began each meeting with the same question : " What are some of the differences between the ways guys and girls are mean ? " // From periods one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girls can turn on you for anything , " said one . " Girls whisper , " said another . " They glare at you . " With growing certainty , they fired out answers : // " Girls are secretive . " // " They destroy you from the inside . " // " Girls are manipulative. " // " There 's an aspect of evil in girls that there is n't in boys . " // " Girls target you where they know you 're weakest . " // " Girls do a lot behind each other 's backs . " // " Girls plan and premeditate. " // " With guys you know where you stand . " // " I feel a lot safer with guys . " // In bold , matter-of-fact voices , girls described themselves to me as disloyal , untrustworthy , and sneaky . They claimed girls use intimacy to manipulate and overpower others . They said girls are fake , using each other to move up the social hierarchy . They described girls as unforgiving and crafty , lying in wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off guard and , with an almost savage eye-for-an-eye mentality , " make her feel the way I felt . " // The girls ' stories about their conflicts were casual and at times filled with self-hatred . In almost every group session I held , someone volunteered her wish to have been born a boy because boys can " fight and have it be over with . " // Girls tell stories of their anger in a culture that does not define their behaviors as aggression . As a result , their narratives are filled with destructive myths about the inherent duplicity of females . As poet and essayist Adrienne Rich notes , " We have been depicted as generally whimsical , deceitful , subtle , vacillating. " // Since the dawn of time , women and girls have been portrayed as jealous and underhanded , prone to betrayal , disobedience , and secrecy . Lacking a public identity or language , girls ' nonphysical aggression is called " catty , " " crafty , " " evil , " and " cunning . " Rarely the object of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural phase in girls ' development . As a result , schools write off girls ' conflicts as a rite of passage , as simply " what girls do . " // What would it mean to name girls ' aggression ? Why have myths and stereotypes served us so well and so long ? // Aggression is a powerful barometer of our social values . According to sociologist Anne Campbell , attitudes toward aggression crystallize sex roles , or the idea that we expect certain responsibilities to be assumed by males and females because of their sex . Riot grrls and women 's soccer notwithstanding , Western society still expects boys to become family providers and protectors , and girls to be nurturers and mothers . Aggression is the hallmark of masculinity ; it enables men to control their environment and livelihoods . For better or for worse , boys enjoy total access to the rough and tumble . The link begins early : the popularity of boys is in large part determined by their willingness to play rough . They get peers ' respect for athletic prowess , resisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool , and confident . // On the other side of the aisle , females are expected to mature into caregivers , a role deeply at odds with aggression . Consider the ideal of the " good mother " : She provides unconditional love and care for her family , whose health and daily supervision are her primary objectives . Her daughters are expected to be " sugar and spice and everything nice . " They are to be sweet , caring , precious , and tender . // " Good girls " have friends , and lots of them . As nine-year-old Noura told psychologists Lyn Mikel Brown and Carol Gilligan , perfect girls have " perfect relationships . " These girls are caretakers in training . They " never have any fights ... and they are always together .... Like never arguing , like ' Oh yeah , I totally agree with you . ' " In depressing relationships , Noura added , " someone is really jealous and starts being really mean .... It 's where two really good friends break up . " // A " good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " nice before she is anything else-before she is vigorous , bright , even before she is honest . " She described the " perfect girl " as the girl who has no bad thoughts or feelings , the kind of person everyone wants to be with .... She is the girl who speaks quietly , calmly , who is always nice and kind , never mean or bossy .... She reminds young women to silence themselves rather than speak their true feelings , which they come to consider " stupid , " " selfish , " " rude , " or just plain irrelevant . // " Good girls , " then , are expected not to experience anger . Aggression endangers relationships , imperiling a girl 's ability to be caring and " nice . " Aggression undermines who girls have been raised to become . // Calling the anger of girls by its name would therefore challenge the most basic assumptions we make about " good girls . " It would also reveal what the culture does not entitle them to by defining what nice really means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Research confirms that parents and teachers discourage the emergence of physical and direct aggression in girls early on while the skirmishing of boys is either encouraged or shrugged off . In one example , a 1999 University of Michigan study found that girls were told to be quiet , speak softly , or use a " nicer " voice about three times more often than boys , even though the boys were louder . By the time they are of school age , peers solidify the fault lines on the playground , creating social groups that value niceness in girls and toughness in boys . // The culture derides aggression in girls as unfeminine , a trend explored in chapter four . " Bitch , " " lesbian , " " frigid , " and " manly " are just a few of the names an assertive girl hears . Each epithet points out the violation of her prescribed role as a caregiver : the bitch likes and is liked by no one ; the lesbian loves not a man or children but another woman ; the frigid woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manly woman is too hard to love or be loved . // Girls , meanwhile , are acutely aware of the culture 's double standard . They are not fooled into believing this is the so-called post-feminist age , the girl power victory lap . The rules are different for boys , and girls know it . Flagrant displays of aggression are punished with social rejection . // At Sackler Day School , I was eating lunch with sixth graders during recess , talking about how teachers expected them to behave at school . Ashley , silver- rimmed glasses snug on her tiny nose , looked very serious as she raised her hand . // " They expect us to act like girls back in the 1800s ! " she said indignantly . Everyone cracked up . // " What do you mean ? " I asked . // " Well , sometimes they 're like , you have to respect each other , and treat other people how you want to be treated . But that 's not how life is . Everyone can be mean sometimes and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be so nice to everyone and you 'll be so cool . Be nice to everyone ! " she mimicked , her suddenly loud voice betraying something more than sarcasm . // " But it 's not true , " Nicole said . The room is quiet . // " Anyone else ? " I asked . // " They expect you to be perfect . You 're nice . When boys do bad stuff , they all know they 're going to do bad stuff . When girls do it , they yell at them , " Dina said . // " Teachers think that girls should be really nice and sharing and not get in any fights . They think it 's worse than it really is , " Shira added . // " They expect you be perfect angels and then sometimes we do n't want to be considered a perfect angel , " Laura noted . // " The teacher says if you do something good , you 'll get something good back , and then she makes you feel like you really should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mean to my sister or my mom and dad , and I wake up the next day and I just do it naturally . I 'm not an angel ! I try to be focused on it , but then I wake up the next day and I 'm cranky . " // In Ridgewood , I listened to sixth graders muse about what teachers expect from girls . Heather raised her hand . // " They just do n't ... " She stopped . No one picked up the slack . // " Finish the sentence , " I urged . // " They expect you to be nice like them , like they supposedly are , but ... " // " But what ? " // " We 're not . " // " I do n't go around being like goody-goody , " said Tammy. // " What does goody-goody mean ? " I asked . // " You 're supposed to be sitting like this " - Tammy crossed her legs and folded her hands primly over her knees- " the whole time . " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Torie. // " Do you always feel nice ? " I asked . // " No ! " several of them exclaimed . // " So what happens ? " // " It 's like you just-the bad part controls over your body , " Tammy said . " You want to be nice and you want to be bad at the same time , and the bad part gets to you . You think " - she contorted her face and gritted her teeth- " I have to be nice . " // " You just want to tell them to shut up ! You just feel like pushing them out of the way and throwing them on the ground ! " said Brittney . " I wanted to do it like five hundred times last year to this girl . If I did n't push her , I just walked off and tried to stay calm . " // Try as they might , most girls ca n't erase the natural impulses toward anger that every human being knows . Yet the early research on aggression turned the myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The first experiments on aggression were performed with almost no female subjects . Since males tend to exhibit aggression directly , researchers concluded aggression was expressed in only this way . Other forms of aggression , when they were observed , were labeled deviant or ignored . // Studies of bullying inherited these early research flaws . Most psychologists looked for direct aggressions like punching , threatening , or teasing . Scientists also measured aggression in environments where indirect acts would be almost impossible to observe . Seen through the eyes of scientists , the social lives of girls appeared still and placid as lakes . It was not until 1992 that someone would question what lay beneath the surface . // That year , a group of Norwegian researchers published an unprecedented study of girls . They discovered that girls were not at all averse to aggression , they just expressed anger in unconventional ways . The group predicted that " when aggression can not , for one reason or another , be directed ( physically or verbally ) at its target , the perpetrator has to find other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural rules against overt aggression led girls to engage in other , nonphysical forms of aggression . In a conclusion uncharacteristic for the strength of its tone , the researchers challenged the image of sweetness among female youth , calling their social lives " ruthless , " " aggressive , " and " cruel . " // Since then , a small group of psychologists at the University of Minnesota has built upon these findings , identifying three subcategories of aggressive behavior : relational , indirect , and social aggression . Relational aggression includes acts that " harm others through damage ( or the threat of damage ) to relationships or feelings of acceptance , friendship , or group inclusion . " Relationally aggressive behavior is ignoring someone to punish them or get one 's own way , excluding someone socially for revenge , using negative body language or facial expressions , sabotaging someone else 's relationships , or threatening to end a relationship unless the friend agrees to a request . In these acts , the perpetrator uses her relationship with the victim as a weapon . // Close relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indirect aggression allows the perpetrator to avoid confronting her target . It is covert behavior in which the perpetrator makes it seem as though there has been no intent to hurt at all . One way this is possible is by using others as vehicles for inflicting pain on a targeted person , such as by spreading a rumor . Social aggression is intended to damage self-esteem or social status within a group . It includes some indirect aggression like rumor spreading or social exclusion . Throughout the book , I refer to these behaviors collectively as alternative aggressions . As the stories in the book make clear , alternative aggressions often appear in conjunction with more direct behaviors. // beneath the radar // In Margaret Atwood 's novel Cat 's Eye , the young protagonist Elaine is seated frozen in fear on a windowsill , where she has been forced to remain in silence by her best friends as she waits to find out what she had done wrong . Elaine 's father enters the room and asks if the girls are enjoying the parade they have been watching : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto mine , sitting close beside me. // " We 're enjoying it extremely , thank you very much , " she says in her voice for adults . My parents think she has beautiful manners . She puts an arm around me , gives me a little squeeze , a squeeze of complicity , of instruction . Everything will be all right as long as I sit still , say nothing , reveal nothing .... As soon as my father is out of the room Cordelia turns to face me .... " You know what this means do n't you ? I 'm afraid you 'll have to be punished . " // Like many girl bullies , Cordelia maneuvers her anger quietly beneath the surface of her good-girl image . She must invest as much energy appearing nice to adults as she will spend slowly poisoning Elaine 's self-esteem . // Some alternative aggressions are invisible to adult eyes . To elude social disapproval , girls retreat beneath a surface of sweetness to hurt each other in secret . They pass covert looks and notes , manipulate quietly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs , whisper , and smile . These acts , which are intended to escape detection and punishment , are epidemic in middle-class environments where the rules of femininity are most rigid . // Cordelia 's tactics are common in a social universe that refuses girls open conflict . In fact , whole campaigns often occur without a sound . Astrid recalled the silent , methodical persistence of her angry friends . //
