" The kid always makes it . I told you that . " Margaret McDill had not seen the man in her life until yesterday , but he had dominated every second of her existence since their meeting . He had told her to call him Joe , and he claimed it was his real name , but she assumed it was an alias . He was a dark-haired , pale-skinned man of about fifty , with deep-set eyes and a coarse five-o'clock shadow . Margaret could not look into his eyes for long . They were dark , furious pools that sucked the life out of her , drained her will . And now they carried knowledge about her that she could not bear . " I do n't believe you , " she said quietly . Something rippled deep in the dark eyes , like the flick of a fish tail . " Have I lied to you about anything else ? " " No . But you ... you let me see your face all night . You wo n't let me go after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it . " " You 're going to kill me and let my son go . " " You think I 'm going to shoot you in broad daylight in front of a freakin ' McDonald 's ? " " You have a knife in your pocket . " He looked at her with scorn . " Jesus Christ . " Margaret looked down at her hands . She did n't want to look at Joe , and she did n't want to chance seeing herself in one of the mirrors . The one at home had been bad enough . She looked like someone who had just come out of surgery , still groggy with anesthesia . An unhealthy glaze filmed her eyes , and even heavy makeup had failed to hide the bruise along her jaw . Four of her painstakingly maintained nails had broken during the night , and there was a long scratch on her inner forearm from the initial scuffle . She tried to remember exactly when that had happened but could n't . Her sense of time had abandoned her . She was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones seemed to fall out of sequence by themselves . She tried to regain control by focusing on her immediate environment . They were sitting in her BMW , in the parking lot of a strip mall , about fifty yards from a McDonald 's restaurant . She had often shopped at the mall , at the Barnes &; Noble superstore , and also at the pet store , for rare tropical fish . Her husband had recently bought a big-screen television at Circuit City , for patient education at his clinic . He was a cardiovascular surgeon . But all that seemed part of someone else 's life now . As remote as the bright side of the moon to someone marooned on the dark half . And her son , Peter ... God alone knew where he was . God and the man beside her . " I do n't care what you do with me , " she said with conviction . " Just let Peter live . Kill me if you have to , just let my son go . He 's only ten years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might take you up on that , " Joe said wearily . He started the BMW 's engine and switched the air conditioner to high , then lit a Camel cigarette . The cold air blasted smoke all over the interior of the car . Margaret 's eyes stung from hours of crying . She turned her head to avoid the smoke , but it was useless . " Where 's Peter now ? " she asked , her voice barely a whisper . Joe took a drag off the Camel and said nothing . " I said- " " Did n't I tell you to stop talking ? " Margaret glanced at the pistol lying on the console between the seats . It belonged to her husband . Joe had taken it from her yesterday , but not before she had learned how useless a gun was to her . At least while they had Peter . Some primitive part of her brain still urged her to grab it , but she doubted she could reach the pistol before he did . He was probably waiting for her to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another thing she 'd learned last night . And his hard-lined face held no mercy . " He 's dead , is n't he , " Margaret heard herself say . " You 're just playing games with me . He 's dead and you 're going to kill me , too- " " Jesus Christ , " Joe said through clenched teeth . He turned over his forearm and glanced at his watch . He wore it on the inside of his wrist so that Margaret could n't see the time . " I think I 'm going to be sick , " she said . " Again ? " He punched a number into the BMW 's cell phone . As he waited for an answer , he muttered , " I do believe this has been the worst twenty-four hours of my life to date . And that includes our little party . " She flinched . " Hey , " he said into the phone . " You in your spot ? ... Okay . Wait about a minute , then do it . " Margaret jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh my God . Peter ! Peter ! " Joe picked up the gun and jammed the barrel into her neck . " You 've come this far , Maggie . Do n't blow it now . You remember what we talked about ? " She closed her eyes and nodded . " I did n't hear you . " Tears rolled down her cheeks . " I remember . " A hundred yards from Margaret McDill 's BMW , Peter McDill sat in an old green pickup truck , his eyes shut tight . The truck smelled funny . Good and bad at the same time , like just-cut grass and old motor oil , and really old fast food . " You can open your eyes now . " Peter opened his eyes . The first thing he saw was a McDonald 's restaurant . It reassured him after his night of isolation . The McDonald 's stood in the middle of a suburban strip mall parking lot . As Peter panned his eyes around the mall , he recognized the stores : Office Depot , Barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent hours in that store . It was only a few miles from his house . He looked down at his wrists , which were bound with duct tape . " Can you take this off now ? " He asked without looking up . The man behind the wheel of the truck was hard for him to look at . Peter had never seen or heard of Huey before yesterday , but for the last twenty-four hours , he had seen no one else . Huey was six inches taller than his father , and weighed at least three hundred pounds . He wore dirty mechanic 's coveralls and heavy plastic glasses of a type Peter had seen in old movies , with thick lenses that distorted his eyes . He reminded Peter of a character in a movie he 'd seen on the satellite one night , when he sneaked into the home theater room . A movie his parents would n't let him watch . The character 's name was Carl , and the boy who was Carl 's friend in the movie said he sounded like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Peter thought Huey was probably like that . " When I was a little boy , " Huey said , peering thoughtfully through the windshield of the pickup , " those golden arches went all the way over the top of the restaurant . The whole place looked like a spaceship . " He looked back at Peter , his too-big eyes apologetic behind the thick glasses . " I 'm sorry I had to tape you up . But you should n't of run . I told you not to run . " Peter 's eyes welled with tears . " Where 's my mom ? You said she was going to be here . " " She 's gon na be here . She 's probably here already . " Through the heat shimmering off the asphalt , Peter scanned the sea of parked cars , his eyes darting everywhere , searching for his mother 's BMW . " I do n't see her car . " Huey dug down into his front coverall pocket . Peter instinctively slid against the door of the pickup truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deep but childlike voice . " I made you something . " The giant hand emerged from the pocket and opened to reveal a carved locomotive . Peter had watched Huey whittling for much of the previous afternoon , but he had n't been able to tell what Huey was working on . The little train in the massive palm looked like a toy from an expensive store . Huey put the carving into Peter 's bound hands . " I finished it while you was sleeping , " he said . " I like trains . I rode one once . When I was little . From St. Louis , after Mamaw died . Joey rode up by hisself on the train and got me . We rode back together . I got to sit in front with the rich people . We was n't supposed to , but Joey figured a way . Joey 's smart . He said it was only fair . He says I 'm good as anybody . Ai n't nobody no better than nobody else . That 's a good thing to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even a tiny engineer inside . " Whittlin 's a good thing , too , " Huey went on . " Keeps me from being nervous . " Peter closed his eyes . " Where 's my mom ? " " I liked talking to you . Before you ran , anyway . I thought you was my friend . " Peter covered his face with his hands , but he kept an eye on Huey through a crack between his left cheek and palm . Now that he knew where he was , he thought about jumping out . But Huey was faster than he looked . Huey dug into his coveralls again and brought out his pocketknife . When he opened the big blade , Peter pressed himself into the passenger door . " What are you doing ? " Huey grabbed Peter 's bound wrists and jerked them away from his body . With a quick jab he thrust the knife between Peter 's forearms and sawed through the duct tape . Then he reached over and unlocked the passenger door of the truck . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the McDonald 's . " Peter looked up at the giant 's face , afraid to believe . " Go see her , boy . " Peter pushed open the truck 's door , jumped to the pavement , and started running toward the McDonald 's . Joe reached across Margaret McDill 's lap and opened the passenger door of the BMW . His smoky black hair brushed against her neck as he did , and she shuddered . She had seen his gray roots during the night . " Your kid 's waiting in the McDonald 's Playland , " he said . Margaret 's heart lurched . She looked at the open door , then back at Joe , who was caressing the BMW 's leather-covered steering wheel . " Sure wish I could keep this ride , " he said with genuine regret . " Got used to this . Yes , sir . " " Take it . " " That 's not part of the plan . And I always stick to the plan . That 's why I 'm still around . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out , dropped the keys on the seat , and started walking away . Margaret sat for a moment without breathing , mistrustful as an injured animal being released into the wild . Then she bolted from the car . With a spastic gait born from panic and exhaustion , she ran toward the McDonald 's , gasping a desperate mantra : " The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not want .... The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not want .... The Lord is my shepherd ... " Huey stopped his green pickup beside his cousin Joe with a screech of eroded brake pads . Two men standing under the roofed entrance of the Barnes &; Noble looked over at the sound . They looked like bums hoping to pass themselves off as customers and spend the morning reading the papers on the sofas inside the bookstore . Joe Hickey silently wished them good luck . He 'd been that far down before . When he climbed into the cab , Huey looked at him with the relief of a two-year-old at its returning mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head bobbing with relief and excitement . " Twenty-three hours , ten minutes , " Hickey said , tapping his watch . " Cheryl 's got the money , nobody got hurt , and no FBI in sight . I 'm a goddamn genius , son . Master of the universe . " " I 'm just glad it 's over , " said Huey . " I was scared this time . " Hickey laughed and tousled the hair on Huey 's great unkempt head . " Home free for another year , Buckethead . " A smile slowly appeared on the giant 's rubbery face . " Yeah . " He put the truck into gear , eased forward , and joined the flow of traffic leaving the mall . Peter McDill stood in the McDonald 's Playland like a statue in a hurricane . Toddlers and teenagers tore around him with abandon , leaping on and off the foam-padded playground equipment in their sock feet . The screeches and laughter were deafening . Peter searched among them for his mother , his eyes wet . In his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , utterly unaware that he was holding it . The glass door of the restaurant opened , and a woman with frosted hair and wild eyes appeared in it . She looked like his mother , but not exactly . This woman was different somehow . She looked too old , and her clothes were torn . She pushed two children out of the doorway , which his mother would never do , and began looking frantically around the playground . Her gaze jumped from child to child , lighted on Peter , swept on , then returned . " Mom ? " he said uncertainly . The woman 's face seemed to collapse inward upon itself . She rushed to Peter and crushed him against her , then lifted him into her arms . His mother had n't done that in a long , long time . A terrible wail burst from her throat , freezing the storm of children into a still life . " Oh , dear Jesus , " Margaret keened . " My baby , my baby , my sweet baby ... " Peter felt hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the little wooden train dropped from his hand onto the pebbled concrete . A toddler wandered over , picked it up , smiled , and walked away with it .
