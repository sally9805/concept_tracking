What makes a college admissions officer say yes to one applicant and no to the next ? To answer that question , New York Times education reporter Jacques Steinberg spent a year observing the selection process at Wesleyan University in Middletown , Conn . The result is his new book , The Gatekeepers : Inside the Admissions Process of a Premier College ( Viking ) . Steinberg talks with TIME about the dos and don'ts of getting kids into the school of their choice . <P> WHAT WAS THE MOST SURPRISING FACT YOU LEARNED ABOUT HOW THE ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE WORKED ? How human the process was . I 'm sure I got taken in by a lot of these How-to-Get-In books that suggest there 's a formula that these schools use . There 's no question that they use numbers , lots of numbers , as guidelines . But there 's also the fact that admissions officers so often went with their gut , got excited when they saw a kid who looked not unlike them as a high school senior . <P> WHAT 'S THE PROPER DIVISION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal world , it 's the student who is going to this college . What better time to start asserting yourself than in the admissions process ? I would hope that the students would be the captains of these teams and that the parents and the guidance counselor would play a supporting role . But you and I know it often does n't work that way , that some parents just ca n't help themselves . And there are some kids who just simply are n't equipped to lead a search like this . Maybe that 's a sign that some of these schools are n't a good fit , because it does require a certain amount of initiative . <P> WHAT 'S THE SILLIEST APPLICATION STUNT YOU 'VE EVER HEARD OF ? Someone sent a life-size doll to Wesleyan . Students really need to keep in mind that in almost every instance the bottom-line question is , Can this student do the work at this institution ? <P> CAN ADMISSIONS OFFICERS TELL WHEN KIDS ARE JUST TRYING TO PAD THEIR RESUMES WITH EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ? Sure . They know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so obvious from some of these resumes that there was no possible way that the person could have done all the things they said they were doing , at least not do them well . <P> HOW EARLY SHOULD A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT START WORRYING ABOUT THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS ? Highly selective colleges really value kids who have taken the most challenging courses at their school , have really maxed out , not just on APs but on those courses that are toughest . That 's often the very first thing they look at . Obviously you do n't want to take the toughest math course as a high school freshman , but the hope is to really put yourself on the road early . <P> WHAT 'S THE CURRENT THINKING ABOUT SAT-PREP COURSES LIKE KAPLAN ? These courses have probably never been more popular . Some applicants get terrific results ; some do n't see any increase at all . The colleges are aware that this is one of those things that separate rich applicants from poor applicants , and they try as best they can to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same standard as kids who can take these courses and sometimes improve their lot .
