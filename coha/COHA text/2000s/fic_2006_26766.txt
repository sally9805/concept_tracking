If you looked up the word " pathetic " in the dictionary , you might find a picture of Vincent Ballard . Ballard had not always been pathetic . At one point in his life , he had been considered brilliant and dynamic . That era had coincided with the dot-com bubble , when Vincent was making more money than he could count as a partner in an Internet start-up that could not miss . In those days , Vincent rode the tiger ; hell , he had tamed the tiger and turned it into a pussycat . Before he became rich , people described Vincent , with his Coke-bottle glasses , acne , and unkempt hair , as a skinny nerd who could n't get even ugly girls to give him a second look . By the nineties , Vincent was wearing contact lenses and handmade suits from London , collecting sports cars like baseball cards , and kicking one centerfold-quality babe out of his bed as soon as another luscious cutie made his cocaine-powered dick rise . Then the bubble burst . Overnight , Vincent 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Starbucks latte . But , hey , no problem . Vincent was n't worried . He was so high all the time that reality had become irrelevant . Was he not the brilliant , sexy Vincent Ballard , brain and stud extraordinaire ? So what if his company went under ? He 'd get a new ideaand soon he 'd be rolling again . There was only one problem ; drugs had messed up Vincent 's mind so badly that the idea part of his brain was now as limp as his dick . Drug habits are expensive . Vincent sold the sports cars and his collection of fine wines . He downsized from his two-million-dollar home to a one-bedroom apartment in Portland 's fashionable Pearl District . Five years after his company went under , he could n't make the rent anymore . Now he lived in a residential motel in a single room that smelled like beer , stale pizza , and garbage ; and he worked at minimum-wage jobs when he could scam the drug tests . A few months before he met Juan Ruiz , Vincent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition that he enroll in a county drug program . Vincent had graduated summa cum laude and was as clean as a whistle . His probation officer had even helped him land a halfway decent job at a software company . Vincent had kicked the habit several times before . During the early days of cleanliness , he was always euphoric . This time was no different . Vincent knew that soon he would be back in the land of Armani and Porsche . Then he had the predictable clash with his supervisor , which led to his early exit from employment , followed by depression and the inevitable reunion with Mr. H. A few weeks after he started using again , Vincent 's connection was arrested . Vincent badly needed a fix , and he learned through the junkie grapevine about a new source for the Mexican black-tar heroin he craved . Juan Ruiz was dealing in Old Town . Since he was selling and Vincent was buying , Ruiz was higher up the food chain than his customer , but not by much . When Vincent spotted Ruiz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with the cold and damp , and his eyes were continually shifting as he scanned the dark , deserted streets for cops . " Are you Juan ? " Vincent asked nervously . He was twitchy and needed his fix . " What you want , bro ? " " Toby told me your stuff is good . " " My shit is the best , " Ruiz said . " Show me some money and you can see for yourself . " Vincent pulled out a handful of crumpled bills , and Ruiz spit out a balloon . If Vincent had been a cop , he would have swallowed it . " Where you been buying ? " Juan asked as he counted the bills . " Around , you know . " All junkies are paranoid , so Vincent was intentionally vague . " Well , you buy from me and I 'll treat you right . Our shit 's cheaper , too , " he added , holding out two bills . " What 's this ? " " A rebate , amigo . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . We got the best shit and the cheapest . You come to me . Do n't go to no other dealers . Spread the word . " A light went on in one of the few areas of Vincent 's brain that were still working . Martin Breach ran the drug business in Portland , but rumor had it that a Colombian cartel was trying to cut into his territory . Breach was not known for being a good sport or a gracious loser , and the word on the street was that he was giving drugs and money to anyone providing information about dealers who were working for Felix Dorado , the cartel 's front man . Back at the motel , Vincent shot up . First things first . But what goes up must come down . Vincent knew that he 'd need to score again soon , but he could n't afford another hit . When he was able to get out of bed , he walked up the street to Lombardi 's . The bar stank of sweat and cheap beer , and catered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes after Vincent convinced the bartender that he had some information Mr. Breach would be interested in hearing , the door opened , and two men walked over to the wooden booth where the bartender had told Vincent to wait . Vincent had once been a businessman , and this was business . He slicked down his hair as best he could , squared his shoulders , and stood up . " Vincent Ballard , " he said , offering his hand . Neither man took it . After a few seconds , Vincent felt ridiculous , and his hand dropped to his side . " Sit down , " Charlie LaRosa said as he slid in across from Ballard . LaRosa had a square face with dark , flat eyes that made him look very intimidating , so Vincent was surprised by how gentle he sounded . Vincent sat on the bench , and the other man squeezed in beside him , forcing Vincent against the wall and cutting off all avenues of escape . The man smelled of aftershave and had thick , greasy hair and long sideburns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
