Tom Delay had a bone to pick with the President when he approached him on the Truman balcony at a White House get-together last week . DeLay did n't like press secretary Ari Fleischer 's pressuring House Republicans to pass a tax credit for low-income families with children . " Last time I checked , " DeLay had snapped to reporters , " he did n't have a vote . " DeLay and conservatives resented being forced to accede to what they felt was slapdash legislation  --  and being made to look miserly for it . Bush did n't back down , saying he wanted a bill passed quickly . The flinty Congressman would not let the matter drop and moments later brought it up with some G.O.P. leaders present . " We did n't appreciate it , " he said of the White House pressure . " Well , " Bush said with a smile , " we were trying to nudge you along . " <P> DeLay knows about nudges . He 's famous for giving them  --  and the odd knee to the groin  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Increasingly , the Texas Republican feels that he and his conservative colleagues have been isolated by the Administration , despite their repeated success in passing the President 's agenda . " They take the House for granted , " a G.O.P. leadership aide said . " This was Tom saying , ' Hey , take notice of me . ' " <P> A little distance from Bush is usually not a bad thing for DeLay . An unflinching conservative advocate , he wins hurrahs from the faithful each time he sticks to his guns in public . And he translates that into legislative power . But sometimes the White House goes too far with its tendency to use him as a foil to show voters that the President is a compassionate conservative . During the 2000 campaign , Bush opposed a DeLay-backed plan on tax credits for the poor to demonstrate that he was a " new kind of Republican , " distinct from the G.O.P. 's tightfisted , meanspirited wing . At the time , Bush accused DeLay &; Co. of trying to " balance their budget on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidant , Bush later apologized and said he would not use DeLay as a right-wing bogeyman again . <P> Yet the two men continue to air differences in public . For DeLay , a former exterminator from Houston , Bush is a Republican born of privilege and more representative of his party 's country-club wing , despite his Midland , Texas , roots and frequent trips to his Crawford ranch . Explaining himself , DeLay simply says , " I 'm just a bug man . "  --  By John F. Dickerson and Michael Weisskopf
