And since that first issue hit the newsstands , its creators and its readers have understood that ESSENCE is more than a magazine : It is a salute to our women , a testimony to their lives , their history and their hope for the future . For three decades ESSENCE has been the preeminent lifestyle publication for African-American women . As we embark on a new century , we will continue to honor and celebrate our readers with a magazine as original and unrivaled as the one brought into being by our dream 30 years ago . Today The ESSENCE Awards once again fills a critical media void as the only prime-time network television special paying tribute to unsung heroes in the community who empower our people and give us " A Cause to Celebrate . " EDWARD LEWIS PUBLISHER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT FOR ME TO REALIZE that 30 years have passed since four young men anxiously awaited the birth of their new magazine , ESSENCE , in April 1970 . The moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands was among the proudest and happiest of my life . In 1987 , The ESSENCE Awards was first presented as an extension of our magazine . The drama of the Awards lies not in whose name is inside the perennial envelope but rather in the quality of the contributions to society made by so many distinguished African-Americans . I am privileged to be one of ESSENCE 'S founders . CLARENCE O.

Now retired , he is no less a force off court : In 1996 Jordan gave $1 million to his alma mater , the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , to launch the Jordan Institute for Families , part of the university 's School of Social Work . The institute strives to help solve the problems facing families by bringing together scholars and community leaders from around the country who tackle such issues as day care , teenage pregnancy and domestic violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan donated money to build the James R. Jordan Boys and Girls Club and Family Life Center in 1994 to honor the memory of his father , committing $2 million to help construct the 41,000-square-foot facility . Jordan 's focus on the family stems from his own upbringing in a strong , intact family that " nurtured and provided a positive influence for me and my siblings , " he has said . What better way to honor that legacy than by giving back , to ensure that it 's carried on in other families ? 1&gt; JCPENNEY SALUTES Photograph MICHEAL JORDAN // THE ESSENCE AWARDS 2000 HONOREES FIVE HOURS AFTER EMMA R.

Gresham has also secured the town a $400,000 block grant and a grant-loan of more than $1 million to construct a sewer system . A schoolteacher for 32 years before turning her sights on politics , Gresham represents not just the hope of a new century but also the enduring spirit of an old guard whose activism , caring and daring have always helped pave a better way , whether in the school halls or at town hall .

These three young men from Newark 's tough streets heeded a higher calling-to become doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sampson Davis pledged at a science career-day event to stick together , support one another and enter medical and dental school . This " all for one and one for all " attitude would pull them through both the challenges of undergraduate school ( the three attended New Jersey 's Seton Hall University ) and the rigors of medical and dental school . When one of them did n't feel like studying , just seeing the other two hitting the books became the motivation to get busy and buckle down , too . Thirteen years after pledging to become doctors , Rameck Hunt , 26 , and Sampson Davis , now 27 , got medical degrees from the University of Medicine &; Dentistry of New Jersey ( UMDNJ ) - Robert Wood Johnson Medical School , while George Jenkins , 27 , received a dental degree from UMDNJ-New Jersey Dental School .

Martin and his wife , Donna , took the first of four children into their home two years ago , the motivation was to alleviate grief and loneliness . Donna Martin 's mother had recently died , and caring for other children became the balm that would soothe her grieving soul . It also became the inspiration that led 23 more families in Bennett Chapel 's and the Open Door Worship Center 's congregations to follow their pastor 's lead and take abandoned and neglected children into their own homes as well . With the congregation at Bennett Chapel numbering just 200 , church members in this East Texas community have either adopted or provided foster care for nearly SO Black , biracial and Hispanic children who come from all over Texas .
