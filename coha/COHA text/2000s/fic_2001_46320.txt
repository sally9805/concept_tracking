1 . <p> THE DOCTOR SAID THAT my eye drifted . Lazy , he said . A lazy eye that must be taught-he said this to my eye itself-like a dog . Then to me : " You will make this eye act correctly if you are a determined young man . And are you ? " <p> Floater , my friends , including good friends , called me , and that was no crueler or kinder of them than of any eleven-year-olds in my town . The left eye was like a small raft on uncalm water , and while it worked for seeing , I had not been able to move it where I wished , not since birth , no matter how hard I rowed across the faces of my parents and teachers , or across the pages in the books I hungrily read . I could see properly , but I could never look like I was properly seeing . <p> The doctor showed me a light-blue rubber ball , the size of a baseball , with a little u-nail pushed into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaded through the u-nail . On the latitudes of the ball 's southern hemisphere he had handwritten the letters A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I , J , K , and L in green , with A at the south pole . On the northern latitudes he had written the numbers 0 through 11 in black , with 0 at the north pole . Two simple stories . <p> He was an eye doctor , different from the doctors who had treated me for smoke inhalation in the hospital two years earlier . As I lay on the examining table , he attached the ball to the elastic band , then the band to the fluorescent light fixture attached to the ceiling . <p> He swung the ball at an angle , so that it passed by my face and shoulder and flew off beyond the range of my peripheral vision . He said , " Read the bottom when it passes . " I could read the A but none of the other letters on the spinning ball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his fist and looked at it without looking at me . Then he swung the ball in a circle around my whole body . As it wound a closer and tighter circle around the center of me and , like a bee at work , close around my head , very close , and around my face , my nose , he said , " Read . " <p> He impatiently explained my schedule : half an hour of the southern hemisphere , and the strenuous effort to see the letters when they were close and when they were in the distant periphery ; half an hour of the northern hemisphere , and absolute concentration on the numbers as they circled me . <p> He was a tough one . It was the late ' 50s , and the dentists and doctors in our town must have all received the same military medical training , because they gave orders , they expected results . He did not bring my mother into the room . He did not want to have to see her , answer her questions . He asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this ? " <p> I had the ball in one hand . I had the elastic band in the other . I was on my back , my eye drifting . The words " if you are a determined young man " echoed in me . I did not look as if I understood anything . I had never seen him before , would probably never see him again , and why should I care if he did not meet my parents , who were both highway construction workers and more " determined " than anyone he had ever met . He did not ask about the smoke in my lungs , though he had my file on his small metal desk . I had been told by the hospital doctor that my lungs would recover from the damage . When they were healthy I would have no problem with the smoke , which would , according to him , always remain in me . <p> I did not tell my mother or father the part about him calling the eye lazy . I never told them about being called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light-blue rubber ball , my routine , my schedule . <p> My father insisted on lying down next to me on my bed so I could show him how it all worked . He asked how it would ever be possible to see the numbers at the very top of the ball . <p> I showed him that when the ball was at a particular distance and angle in its orbit you could see to the very top : 0 . You had to anticipate that brief moment . It was easy to see the A at the bottom , and possible , depending on the spin , to see the B , C , and some of the other letters . The letters and the numbers were like landmasses on a globe . <p> " An hour of this every day and you could start seeing the future , " he joked . <p> " Get up , " my mother said to him , because it was not quite right for him to be on my bed . I had never seen him like that . I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure even now-now that I 'm the age they were then-that they ever rested . <p> My father ignored her . He looked up at the spot on the ceiling where he would put the hook . From that position on the bed , he looked at the three walls before him and even seemed to look at the one behind him , all without moving his head or his sun-blackened neck . " This , " he said , " is a solid place . " He said it firmly . He was defensive of my mother , who blamed herself for the kitchen fire that had trapped me in my room for a short while and burned more than half our house down , and he was defensive about the reconstruction and the plumbing that he and a friend had done . It had taken two years . My mother 's youngest brother , Roger , did all the electrical . It took almost a year to redo the wiring Uncle Roger had done . <p> Later that afternoon , when I hung the ball on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched . " Plumb , " he said . It was not a comment on the ball , the ceiling , any of that . It was about the world , our family 's situation , our place in the big picture . Things were " plumb " or " out of plumb , " as far as he was concerned . Because of his nature and his peculiar form of optimism , it took a lot to convince him that anything was ever really out of plumb . <p> Before dinner , he and my mother sat on the same large , worn wingback chair in the living room . She sat next to him but almost in his lap ; her left shoulder-blade rested against his chest ; her cheek was near and sometimes against his . Most evenings , they read library books to each other on that chair , which was old but not smoke-damaged . Our dog , Cookie , regularly attended their little service , probably because he found their voices soothing , or because he particularly valued the Reader 's Digest condensed form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read all of the Bible once , they did not read it in their chair . They were churchgoers , but not the usual troubled , undetermined believers . They believed . <p> In my room I had swung the blue ball too fast . I swung it more slowly . I heard them reading . Usually I sat on the floor near them and listened to their unselfconsciously expressive voices , night fires sending up tiny , sizzling sparks . On top of the vinyl ottoman , Cookie gnawed and scratched himself , making enlightened grrrr-ing noises . They read one chapter only , less than ten pages . There was no discussion , but there was no lost sense of connection in the silence . <p> I could smell dumplings expanding in the yellow unclarified soup of celery and onions and paprika-rubbed chicken barely still on the bone at the bottom of the pot . Lemons were halved and crushed , the pulp scraped out . The long wooden spoon knocked the sides of the green plastic lemonade pitcher Uncle Roger 's wife , Alice , had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually just called me to supper , would come to my room to talk with me . <p> I could not see her when she stood at my doorway to watch me finish my routine . I was straining to see the numbers 9 , 10 , 11 at the equator as the ball circled beyond my vision and back into it and beyond again . I knew that with practice I could learn to track the ball 's every movement . I would eventually flinch less and keep my head still and learn how to breathe a certain way that made inhaling and exhaling part of seeing . I would see farther into the periphery . <p> She said , " Is it hard to do ? " She meant that it was not hard for a young man as determined as I was . <p> " I 'm trying to concentrate , " I said . <p> " Sorry , " she said . " Well . Concentrate . " <p> The ball circling my face counterclockwise caused thrilling dizziness and blurring . Nothing was visible to me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball bisect , the north swing out of sync across the south . When everything slowed , then reconciled , I recited what I saw . A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I , J , K , L , 11 , 10 , 9 , 8 . That was as far as I could get . <p> I did not see her melted hand , the keloid gloss on her fused thumb and first finger , the other fingers missing . I did not see the drying spoon held waist-high in her other hand . I had seen all of it before , and I can remember it now , that closed bird-claw of her left hand , the bits of damp pulp on the spoon , her pencil grip on the warped , rough wooden stem , a kind of writing motion she made with both hands , and a smile that always seemed related to that motion . <p> I swung the ball clockwise , out beyond my toes and head . It lightly brushed the walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so much pleasure . " Oh , son , " with such joy . My sense of awe increased . Though only by a small fraction , it increased , and I felt amazed at her . She showed no sadness , not a trace , though she had all but lost that hand , and she and my father , uninsured , had lost , through the fire or the smoke or the water damage , everything , including their used Bug in the garage . I had not thought of the fire except as a thing that had thrown us only a little out of plumb , and for only a short while . The fire had happened . Two years later they rebuilt . My mother joined my father on the construction crew . With no money to spare , they sent me to the eye doctor . <p> I can remember now , with great particularity , what I was almost oblivious to then , on that first day of exercising my eye . My mother was making food in a pot she had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on one of the two pieces of furniture in the living room . Cookie had just jumped off of the other piece , which did n't match ; the chair and ottoman had come from different friends of the family . There were wall plates on the light switches in my room but nowhere else . There was not a desk , not a chest of drawers and a reading lamp in their room as there were in mine . There was a mattress on their floor , not a new bed and frame . I had clothes in my closet , dress shoes and tennis shoes . <p> I practiced every day for two years , until I was thirteen , which was the only other time I saw the eye doctor . He held a mirror before me and asked me to see for myself if I was " correct . " He did not quite believe . <p> I knew it was hopeless to explain that from my first day with the ball , I no longer cared if I would look like I was properly seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to explain to him how the ball made a sound swinging over me , a breathing counterpoint to my breathing . The world , the situation , all of that , inside and outside me , seemed projected onto the ball . I would see farther and farther into the periphery . I was determined . I saw along the blue curve to the larger numbers 11 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , and , eventually , to the smaller ones , and when that world was at a certain distance and angle , I saw the black 0 at the very pole . <p> 2 . <p> " I want a big booth , on the window , " I told the hostess , " away from the clock . I 'm not in a hurry . I 'm going to just park myself here . " And think . <p> It seemed like everything I could ever think about was on the restaurant table before me . Spoon , fork , knife , wrapped in a napkin , bound in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I had to eat , did n't I ? Did eating at IHOP make me a monster ? The cops would know soon enough . They 'd find me . And what I did would n't be a crime if I said it was n't . I was the LumberWorld company nurse  --  for twenty years . The procedure went wrong , and that happens . I was lancing a sty . <p> " I 'm not ready to order yet . I need to look at the menu , " I told the waitress . Dodie . Or Dorie . <p> I was lancing a sty . <p> A two-page menu was on the table . A ketchup bottle . According to Heinz , America 's favorite ketchup is Heinz . A card cleverly folded into a tent advertised the Earlybird Special . Eggs Fresh . Ask Our Hens . <p> His lower lid almost swelled the whole left . eye closed . I taped his right eye shut . I said , " This will help , " but did n't say who or what . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his chest . I asked , " You mean you 're afraid ? " <p> He did n't answer . <p> I said , " Of course . " I said , " I 'm not through with you , soldier . " I pushed that surgical lance into the meat of his left eye , all the way in , and I julienned his eyeball , more or less . <p> The cushions at my booth had the right firmness . The table , not a flimsy table at all , was covered with pieces of information . Equal Sweetener Tastes Like Sugar . No Steak Sauce Is Better . Quality Is Guaranteed . A bunch of propaganda . <p> The left eye . Four seconds is what it took . His upper eyelid closed over the lance , some kind of reflex probably , and I turned the blade inside his eye and sliced through the lid like the skin of a grape . He passed out . I taped a gauze compress over the butchered eye . I washed up . I left . <p> And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given me what people do n't usually give a fat and unattractive woman : the benefit of the doubt . That was his mistake . <p> I wanted the real sugar , the regular coffee . The Big Deal Big Meal . I wanted the Farmer 's Gold Seal half- &-half; in those little white plastic cups . Another pat of butter . Another side of sausage . I wanted the maple , not the flavored syrup . I asked for juice with ice , and I wanted my ice . The waitress acted like I asked for the impossible . <p> When he first sat down , I taped the right eye shut . Because-he would n't look at me , and that happens to me , and I do n't like it . I said , " What are you not looking at ? " I moved his head so he had to see me through the untaped eye . The bad one . It could be I have a pretty face . It could be I have a nice face . How would he know if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't like that any more than I like being ignored . I said , " You 're eighteen . Your name 's Zack . Single . Male . " He had given me a onepage medical history . He was 5 ' 6 " or 5 ' 7 " . Pleasant smile . No glasses or contacts . <p> He said , " You 're pushing forty . Female . Your name 's Johnson , " which it was , and which was always funny for the boys his draftable age who noticed my nurse 's badge : My Name Is L. Johnson . <p> He asked , " Lynn ? Lola ? " He asked , " Ladybird ? Loretta ? " <p> " Are you going over there ? " I asked . The Vietnam question . You could n't not ask it . It 's what you asked a fit boy that age . <p> I did n't like any of it . I thought , Dora , Dodie , Dina , if you ever come back to my table , I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs runny . I did n't want my toast greased up . <p> My lipstick was fresh . I pressed my red lips together like I was spreading the color . I said , " I need you to take your shirt off . Here 's a gown . And what do you do for LumberWorld ? " <p> " Move boards from here to there , " he said , " loading-unloading , ' " and yanked his shirttails out and ducked his head in and pulled the shirt off . I was taken by surprise . There was a flimsy cage where his upper body should have been . Bones . Bones and no flesh . " And I 'm a driver sometimes , " he said . He saw me trying to look at his bare awfulness . His arms were skinny as broom-handles . <p> I took the gown out of his fists , moved his puny arms away from his waxy-skinned , narrow chest . " God , " I said . " You 're nearly starved . " <p> Dora said , " You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is it Dora , dear ? " I had my nurse 's uniform on , which as far as I could tell legitimized my scrutiny of people . I said , " I need to be less fat-do n't even comment , OK ? - and- here 's a secret-I need to be less ugly . But I need to eat . You 're fat , Dora , but you eat . You 're ugly , but you eat . Right ? " <p> He said , " I ca n't talk about it . I could maybe get in trouble with Selective Service . " <p> I said , " Them . The national undertakers . " <p> It was a nasty sty . A dark speck had made its own eye inside the swelling bubble of pus on his lower lid . It had closed his eye into a boxer 's wink . If you touch one of these you can feel it pulse . <p> I pushed two fingertips against it . He whispered , " Hurts . " <p> Dora marched off toward the Please Wait To Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who will not wait . Dora and the hostess huddled , and there was some pointing at me . Some frowning . There was some new and improved ugliness in Dora , worse than the ugliness I saw before . <p> I said , " Tell me the rest-about Selective Service . " It was none of my business . I stopped pushing . <p> He said , " You on the pill ? " Yeah . Like that . It was his way of saying , My draft number is none of your business . Or it was a preemptive strike to keep me from asking anything at all about him , or it was a young man , afraid , saying , You show me yours , I 'll show you mine . <p> I pushed hard again on the sty . " Little fucker , " I said . <p> " Fair is fair , " he said , his eye winking , his gaze focusing . He . took the gown out of my hands , put it on . <p> What you do with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut and you tweezer out the invasive stuff , and you press and press , and then you pat to drain out everything . Most of the time you do n't need to stitch . Young people heal fast . Is n't that what everybody always says ? <p> He said , . like he was a doctor , like I was his . patient , " You 're on the pill . " I tied the collar of the gown for him . The little white string . His neck was skinny as my daily newspaper . <p> He did n't know where to put his hands now that he was n't holding the gown . <p> I had to make it up to Dora for being mean . I told the hostess , " Tell her I want to make it up to her . " <p> I placed each of his hands on an armrest . I calmed them with my hands . And he spilled the beans . He had learned that if he lost forty pounds or more from his Standard Weight he would be ineligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your parents know ? " They knew , he said , and then , " You do n't know them . They 'd do anything for me . " Which meant they 'd shut up and watch . And hope . And love their disappearing son . And hope . I know about that . I remember about how my parents loved me , their strange one , their ugly child , and worried for me . They worried for me , and they loved me enough . You would think the beauty they helped me see in myself would save me from needing to recognize it through other people 's eyes . <p> I said , " We do n't freeze you for this procedure . It 's a split-second thing . " I unpackaged the surgical lance . I positioned the blade . I drew it across tissue that I pinched up with my fingertips . Expert . I tweezered out the cause of his problem . I pressed on the open eye of the wound . I thought about the way things are that a young person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He looked closely at me . Penetrating but not cruel . He looked in , entered me like a large room , looked around to see what was on the walls . <p> Probably if you tape one eye shut , the other immediately compensates by seeing what it never could . What 's the science there ? Complicated , I bet . He was diagnosing , I knew that . You have to be cold as snow on a thorn when you diagnose . You have to be injured critically to know what might kill or wound a person , and I 'm no doctor , but I know how the best , the most merciful ones measure it all . Mercilessly . <p> He whispered , " You do n't want to be on the pill . " It 's a guess you could make about any woman my age with no wedding ring . Any boy his age would speculate . That 's the age they speculate about old virgins . It 's what they do . <p> I reached behind him , pulled the little string-knot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " That made him laugh . <p> I want more than one goddamn paper napkin . I 'm greasy , and I 've spilled on myself , and if Dina or Dora or whoever wo n't wait on me I 'm not paying . I told all that to the hostess . <p> I changed my mind about forgiving him . And that does n't mean I did n't feel compassion for him . I wanted to help as much as I wanted to hurt . " I 'm going to the bathroom to clean up , " I told the hostess . " You tell Dora I expect to see-her at my table when I get out . " <p> A miserable bathroom . Poor light . No vent . Bad tiling job . Smoke  --  stained mirrors . Some of that grout , some of that smoke , air , light , some of it must have been twenty years old . A toilet the size of a toy . Whose ass fits toilets like that ? <p> I loosened the knot around his blushing throat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " How much 've you lost ? " <p> He made his best effort not to look . Lasted one second . He looked up my arms . He looked at my face . Not a nice face . Not pretty . Not at all . Tried to look at my breasts through my blouse . Eighteen . God . Boys 're just one giant infected eye at that age . <p> The boltless door to the only bathroom stall was gummy-on both sides . The sink , with a bull's-eye of green scum inside a target of lighter green , gurgled . My face in the mirror was so far away from the face in my mind . The towel dispenser , which said Clean Every Time , was empty . <p> He sank back in the chair . I was glad I had taped the right eye shut . He would n't look at me anyway . He looked over my shoulder , like he saw something behind me sweep into his view , then sweep out . <p> I said , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost enough , have you ? " <p> He said , " I ca n't lose it fast enough . " Without looking at me , he looked like he saw on me the whole world 's disinterested way of numbering boys like him . " I 'm nervous , " he said . <p> I asked , " You mean you 're afraid ? " <p> He did n't answer . <p> I said , " Of course . " <p> That 's when I unpackaged the second surgical lance . That 's when I said , " I 'm not through with you , soldier . " <p> Author Affiliation
