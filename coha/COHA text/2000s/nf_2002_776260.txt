Is Islam a Religion of Peace ? // " ISLAM IS PEACE . " // George W. Bush went to a mosque to say it late in 2001 . The September 11 terrorist attacks , he averred , " violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith . " In his September 20 address to Congress , he elaborated : " The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics-a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam . " // The President 's counterpart in London , Prime Minister Tony Blair , concurred : September 11 , he said flatly , " has nothing to do with Islam . " // In 1998 , President Bill Clinton had made a similar pronouncement in a speech before the United Nations : // Many believe there is an inevitable clash between Western civilization and Western values , and Islamic civilizations and values . I believe this view is terribly wrong . False prophets may use and abuse any religion to justify whatever political objectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that almighty God himself , the merciful , grants a license to kill . But that is not our understanding of Islam .... Americans respect and honor Islam . // Of course Americans should respect and honor Muslims , like all people , But does Islam teach Muslims in return the courtesy ? Is George Bush right in saying that the terror of September 11 represented only a " fringe form of Islamic extremism " ? // Certain assumptions are so ingrained that it is difficult even to notice their presence . In the contemporary Western world , one such assumption is that all religions are fundamentally benign-in other words , essentially like Christianity . Westerners are fond of assuming that because Islam is ( like Christianity ) a religion , it must be ( like Christianity ) peaceful at its heart . And just as Christianity has its belligerent fundamentalists who misunderstand and distort its message of peace , so does Islam . // Western commentators these days are fond of pointing out that Muslims , like Christians , worship one God only , respect Jesus and Mary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revealed Word of God , which contains stories of Adam and Abraham and Moses and David . One prominent scholar of Islam , Karen Armstrong , notes : " Constantly the Quran points out that Muhammad had not come to cancel the older religions , to contradict their prophets or to start a new faith . His message is the same as that of Abraham , Moses , David , Solomon , of Jesus . " Armstrong , indeed , even blames Christians for the misapprehension that Islam is not a peaceful religion : // Ever since the Crusades , the people of Western Christendom developed a stereotypical and distorted vision of Islam , which they regarded as the enemy of decent civilization .... It was , for example , during the Crusades , when it was Christians who had instigated a series of brutal holy wars against the Muslim world , that Islam was described by the learned scholar-monks of Europeas an inherently violent and intolerant faith , which had only been able to establish itself by the sword . The myth of the supposed fanatical intolerance of Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // If Islam truly is peaceful , then of course President Bush is right : the terrorists who attacked America must be acting against the principles of their own religion . That was the assumption at CNN when , in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , the network posted this poll question on its website : " Should a religion be judged by the acts of its followers ? " For Westerners with Christian backgrounds-that is , most Westerners-it was a loaded question . With public opinion running high against Islam , the media was keeping up steady pressure on what it saw as unenlightened religious bigotry . If Christianity should n't be judged by the sins of particular Christians , then Islam should n't be judged by the sins of those Muslims who hijacked planes and rammed them into buildings full of innocent people . // It seems a reasonable enough caveat . But the reality is more complicated . Islam is indeed like Christianity in many ways , but in others it is as different as the sun is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // It all depends on whom you ask . // To some Muslims , the terrorist attacks on America violated the fundamental tenets of Islam and the plain words of the Qur'an . To some , they did n't . This is not a matter of learned Muslims looking askance while the uneducated , inflamed by the self-serving propaganda of extremist leaders , cheer for the cameras in Palestine as they watch replays of the planes hitting their targets . In fact , it 's the learned Muslims who are split on the issue of terrorism . // This , in large part , results from the nature of authority in Islam . The religion has no central authority beyond the Qur'an , the holy book that Muslims believe was given by the one almighty God , Allah , to the Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century . There is no supreme Islamic teacher who can tell Muslims-and the world-what Islam is and what it is n't . This makes for a multiplicity of voices in Islam , all appealing to Qur'anic authority and claiming to speak for true Islam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that the believer can read the Bible and work out the truth on his own . Just as Protestant groups in practice developed their own traditions for interpreting the Bible and applying its message to their lives , so individual Muslims are guided in their communities to a right understanding of their sacred book . In Sunni Islam , which comprises over 85 percent of Muslim believers worldwide , a certain teaching authority is invested in the ulama : the ( often national ) community of muftis , the teachers and scholars of the Qur'an and Sunnah , or Muslim traditions , whose fatwas , or legal rulings on matters open to question of dispute , are generally accepted by believers . // But the muftis do n't all agree about terrorism . // Some Muslim leaders have indeed condemned bin Laden 's attacks outright . Saudi Arabia 's Sheikh Saalih al-Lehaydaan , the head of the Islamic judiciary in a country that knows no law outside of Islam , declared : " Killing a person who has not committed a crime is one of the major sins and terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave criminal act which Islam does not approve of and no one should applaud . " // Another prominent Saudi teacher of the faith , Sheikh Saalih as Suhaymee , agreed . He observed in his fatwa that Muslims are forbidden from " killing women , children , the elderly . " He addressed a popular Muslim claim when he went on to say that this prohibition still holds " despite the fact that the associates of these categories of people may be involved in fighting with the Muslims . " He thus concluded that the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center , because they killed " none but innocent non-Muslims and Muslims , from all the various parts of the world , of different races , " were " not permissible . " In fact , " Islam does not allow this kind of attack in any form whatsoever . " He even claimed that " none of the scholars " who hold " the correct form of Islam , affirm the likes of these actions . " // But this sheikh could establish no unanimity for his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did agree with him-to a point . One was Sheikh Omar bin Bakri bin Muhammad , the judge of Great Britain 's Sharia , or Islamic law court , secretary general of the Islamic World League , and spokesman for the International Islamic Front for Europe , as well as founder of the radical international Muslim group al-Muhajiroun . On its website al-Muhajiroun posted a fatwa by Sheikh Omar , saying that , yes , the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were " a crime and violation for the sanctity of Human beings sic which is prohibited in Islam . " They were a crime even though the " US Government and its Military forces are a legitimate target as far as Islam is concerned . " Muslims can legitimately attack American troops , Sheikh Omar explained , because the United States is " engaging in aggression and atrocities " against Muslims in Iraq , Palestine , Afghanistan and Sudan-and because of American support for " the Pirate State of Israel and the dictator Leaders in the Muslim world . " Nevertheless , he tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " it is not a justification to attack American People because Islam forbid us to fight people because of their Nationality , Color , etc .... rather because of their aggression or occupation sic . " // Yet this same imam , when asked what lessons Muslims could draw from the attacks on the United States , passed up the opportunity to instruct his coreligionists in how they could have responded to this " American aggression " without committing a crime in the eyes of Allah . Instead , all the lessons he drew were directed squarely at the Great Satan itself . The attacks , explained Sheikh Omar , were a consequence of " atrocities and the aggression committed by the US Government and its forces against the third World in general and the Muslim World . " Going beyond even Osama bin Laden , this influential divine enumerated atrocities including not only American support of Israel , the occupation of Somalia and the bombing of Iraq and Sudan , but also the occupation of " Muslim land in Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Egypt and Turkey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who victimize Muslims and Islam . " The Western powers , explained the sheikh , are indifferent to " Muslim lives and blood . " He pointed out that the attacks showed that Muslims had the " determination to die for a just cause . " They " shake the arrogance of the Western Government and undermine their claims to be invulnerable country in the World sic . " // The success of the attacks , Sheikh Omar concluded , showed that " there is no defense system could stand in the way of the determination of a person who wants to become a Martyr . " His conception of a martyr , it should be noted , differs from the common Western idea , derived from Christianity . A Christian martyr is someone who is killed for his faith , without bringing his own death upon himself . The notion of a " martyr " as someone who kills others viewed as enemies of the faith , and in the process gets himself killed , is a distinctly Islamic construct . // Sheikh Omar 's pronouncements about the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voiced by icons of the left such as Noam Chomsky and Susan Sontag ; though presumably they did n't intend to inspire young men to dedicate themselves to destroying the Great Satan . // Meanwhile , Osama bin Laden 's favorite imams went even further . In the celebrated video in which bin Laden , for all intents and purposes , admitted complicity in the September 11 terrorism , he asked his guest : " What is the stand of the Mosques there in Saudi Arabia ? " The sheikh who had come to pay homage to the terrorist mastermind replied , " Honestly , they are very positive . " One prominent Saudi sheikh , he said , " gave a good sermon in his class after the sunset prayers .... His position is really very encouraging . " Another , said the sheikh , " gave a beautiful fatwa , may Allah bless him . " // On the thorniest question arising from the terrorist attacks , this second sheikh disagreed absolutely with those who condemned the attacks because they killed innocents : " This was jihad and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims . He swore to Allah . " // The Wahhabis // Those who defend Islam say that these pro-bin Laden Saudis are Wahhabis , and that this explains their hard line . // The Wahhabis are the notoriously strict Muslim sect that holds sway in Saudi Arabia and maintains a haughty sense of superiority over the rest of the Muslim world . Founded by the Sunni reformist Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul al-Wahhab ( ca. 1700-1792 ) , the Wahhabis purport to restore the purity of Islam by rejecting all innovations that occurred after the third Islamic century-that is , around the year 950 . ( Presumably Islamic practice before that date could be directly traced to the words and actions of the Prophet , but after that the connection to Muhammad becomes more tenuous. ) // The most visible consequence of this reform is that Wahhabi mosques lack minarets , but the Wahhabis cut far deeper into the Islamic consciousness than that . Al-Wahhab rejected the widespread Sunni practice of venerating Muslim saints , calling it a species of shirk , the cardinal Muslim sin of worshiping created beings along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared all non-Wahhabi Muslims to be unbelievers , and waged jihad , or holy war , against them . Wahhabi fortunes waxed and waned throughout the nineteenth century , but in 1932 the Wahhabi Sheikh Ibn Saud captured Riyadh and established the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on Wahhabi principles . // Other Muslim groups , in turn , despise the Wahhabis and deny their claim to represent anything like true or pure Islam . One Muslim characterized the Wahhabis venomously as unprincipled opportunists : // While claiming to be adherents to " authentic " Sunnah Muslim tradition , these deviants are quick to label anyone who opposes their beliefs ... as " sufi , " that is , akin to adherents of the mystical Sufi sect , elements of which Wahhabis and other Muslims consider heretical while exploiting the Muslims ' love for Islam by overexaggerating the phrase " Qur'an and Sunnah " in their senseless rhetoric . // Many Western scholars blame the Wahhabis almost exclusively for terrorism , while maintaining a sharp distinction between Islam in its Wahhabi form and the genuine article . Journalist Stephen Schwartz , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentalism . " He asserts that " fundamentalism was always a tendency in Islam , as in every other religion , but did not gain permanent influence until the 18th century and the rise of Wahhabism . " The Wahhabis , he says , prosper on Saudi oil money and an American military presence . If their funding were cut off , they would " dwindle to a feeble remnant , " and presumably terrorism would decline as well . // Certainly Wahhabis have generously supported terrorists . The Saudi government 's affection for the Taliban is well documented . But the problem of Islamic terror is not simply the problem of the Wahhabis . There are disquieting signs that Muslim terror is much more broadly based . It is precisely the Wahhabis ' claim to represent pure Islam that has inspired Muslim groups from North Africa to Indonesia-and gives the Wahhabis and their spiritual kin resilience and staying power .
