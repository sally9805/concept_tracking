One She sat alone in her chambers , draped in twilight 's shadows and evening 's solitude , her thoughts darker than the night descending and heavier than the weight of all Paranor . She retired early these days , ostensibly to work but mostly to think , to ponder on the disappointment of today 's failures and the bleakness of tomorrow 's prospects . It was silent in the high tower , and the silence gave her a momentary respite from the struggle between herself and those she would lead . It lasted briefly , only so long as she remained secluded , but without its small daily comfort she sometimes thought she would have gone mad with despair . She was no longer a girl , no longer even young , though she retained her youthful looks , her pale translucent skin still unblemished and unlined , her startling blue eyes clear , and her movements steady and certain . When she looked in the mirror , which she did infrequently now as then , she saw the girl she had been twenty years earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body stayed young , her spirit grew old . Responsibility aged her more quickly than time . Only the Druid Sleep , should she avail herself of it , would stay the wearing of her heart , and she would not choose that remedy anytime soon . She could not . She was the Ard Rhys of the Third Druid Council , the High Druid of Paranor , and while she remained in that office , sleep of any kind was in short supply . Her gaze drifted to the windows of her chamber , looking west to where the sun was already gone behind the horizon , and the light it cast skyward in the wake of its descent a dim glow beginning to fail . Shethought her own star was setting , as well , its light fading , its time passing , its chances slipping away . She would change that if she could , but she no longer believed she knew the way . She heard Tagwen before she saw him , his footfalls light and cautious in the hallway beyond her open door , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come , Tagwen , " she called as he neared . He came through the door and stopped just inside , not presuming to venture farther , respecting this place that was hers and hers alone . He was growing old , as well , nearly twenty years of service behind him , the only assistant she had ever had , his time at Paranor a mirror of her own . His stocky , gnarled body was still strong , but his movements were slowing and she could see the way he winced when his joints tightened and cramped after too much use . There was kindness in his eyes , and it had drawn her to him from the first , an indication of the nature of the man inside . Tagwen served because he respected what she was doing , what she meant to the Four Lands , and he never judged her by her successes or failures , even when there were so many more of the latter than the former . " Mistress , " he said in his rough , gravel-laced voice , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed . It was an odd , stiff gesture he had affected from the beginning . He leaned forward as if to share a confidence that others might try to overhear . " Kermadec is here . " She rose at once . " He will not come inside , " she said , making it a statement of fact . Tagwen shook his head . " He waits at the north gate and asks if you will speak with him . " The Dwarf 's lips tightened in somber re-flection . " He says it is urgent . " She reached for her cloak and threw it about her shoulders . She went by him , touching his shoulder reassuringly as she passed . She went out the door and down the hallway to begin her descent . Within the stairwell , beyond the sound of her own soft footfalls , she heard voices rise up from below , the sounds of conversations adrift on the air . She tried to make out what they said , but could not . They would be speaking of her ; they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued as their leader , why she presumed that she could achieve anything after so many failures , why she could not recognize that her time was past and another should take her place . Some would be whispering that she ought to be forced out , one way or another . Some would be advocating stronger action . Druid intrigues . The halls of Paranor were rife with them , and she could not put a stop to it . At Walker 's command , she had formed this Third Council on her return to the Four Lands from Parkasia . She had accepted her role as leader , her destiny as guide to those she had recruited , her responsibility for rebuilding the legacy of the Druids as knowledge givers to the Races . She had formed the heart of this new order with those few sent under duress by the Elven King Kylen Elessedil at his brother Ahren 's insistence . Others had come from other lands and other Races , drawn by the prospect of exploring magic 's uses . That had been twenty years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time and an inability to effect any measurable change in the thinking and attitudes of the governing bodies of those lands and Races had leeched most of that away . What remained was a desperate insistence on clinging to her belief that she was not meant to give up . But that alone was not enough . It would never be enough . Not for someone who had come out of darkness so complete that any chance at redemption had seemed hopeless . Not for Grianne Ohmsford , who had once been the Ilse Witch and had made herself Ard Rhys to atone for it . She reached the lower levels of the Keep , the great halls that connected the meeting rooms with the living quarters of those she had brought to Paranor . A handful of these Druids came into view , shadows sliding along the walls like spilled oil in the light of the flameless lamps that lit the corridors . Some nodded to her ; one or two spoke . Most simply cast hurried glances and passed on . They feared and mistrusted her , these Druids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to help themselves , and she could not find the heart to blame them . Terek Molt walked out of a room and grunted his unfriendly greeting , outwardly bold and challenging . But she could sense his real feelings , and she knew he feared her . Hated her more than feared her , though . It was the same with Traunt Rowan and Iridia Eleri and one or two more . Shadea a'Ru was beyond even that , her venomous glances so openly hostile that there was no longer any communication between them , a situation that it seemed nothing could help . Grianne closed her eyes against what she was feeling and wondered what she was going to do about these vipers -- what she could do that would not have repercussions beyond anything she was prepared to accept . Young Trefen Morys passed her with a wave and a smile , his face guileless and welcoming , his enthusiasm evident . He was a bright light in an otherwise darkened firmament , and she was grateful for his presence . Some within the order still believed in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who came to her , but she had hoped for loyalty and a sense of responsibility toward the office she held . She had been foolish to think that way , and she no longer did so . Perhaps it was not inaccurate to say that now she merely hoped that reason might prevail . " Mistress , " Gerand Cera greeted in his soft voice as he bowed her past him , his tall form lean and sinuous , his angular features sleepy and dangerous . There were too many of them . She could not watch out for all of them adequately . She put herself at risk every time she walked these halls -- here in the one place she should be safe , in the order she had founded . It was insane . She cleared the front hall and went out into the night , passed through a series of interconnected courtyards to the north gates , and ordered the guard to let her through . The Trolls on watch , impassive and silent , did as they were told . She did not know their names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was enough to keep her reassured of their loyalty . Whatever else happened in this steadily eroding company of the once faithful , the Trolls would stand with her . Would that prove necessary ? She would not have thought so a month ago . That she asked the question now demonstrated how uncertain matters had become . She walked to the edge of the bluff , to the wall of trees that marked the beginning of the forest beyond , and stopped . An owl glided through the darkness , a silent hunter . She felt a sudden connection with him so strong that she could almost envision flying away as he did , leaving everything behind , returning to the darkness and its solitude . She brushed the thought aside , an indulgence she could not afford , and whistled softly . Moments later , a figure detached itself from the darkness almost in front of her and came forward . " Mistress , " the Maturen greeted , dropping to one knee and bowing deeply . " Kermadec , you great bear , " she replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How good it is to see you . " Of the few friends she possessed , Kermadec was perhaps the best . She had known him since the founding of the order , when she had gone into the Northland to ask for the support of the Troll tribes . No one had ever thought to do that , and her request was cause enough for a convening of a council of the nations . She did not waste the opportunity she had been given . She told them of her mission , of her role as Ard Rhys of a new Druid Council , the third since Galaphile 's time . She declared that this new order would accept members from all nations , the Trolls included . No prejudices would be allowed ; the past would play no part in the present . The Druids were beginning anew , and for the order to succeed , all the Races must participate . Kermadec had stepped forward almost at once , offering the support of his sizeable nation , of its people and resources . Prompted by her gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his decision was made even before the council of nations had met . His Rock Trolls were not imbued with a strong belief in magic , but it would be their honor to serve as her personal guard . Give them an opportunity to demonstrate their reliability and skill , and she would not regret it . Nor had she ever done so . Kermadec had stayed five years , and in that time became her close friend . More than once , he had solved a problem that might otherwise have troubled her . Even after he had left for home again , his service complete , he had remained in charge of choosing the Trolls that followed in his footsteps . Some had doubted the wisdom of allowing Trolls inside the walls at all , let alone as personal guards to the Ard Rhys . But she had walked in darker places than these and had allied herself with creatures far more dangerous . She did not think of any Race as predisposed toward either good or evil ; she saw them all only as being composed of creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as she saw the members of her Druid order , she thought , though she might wish it otherwise . " Kermadec , " she said again , the relief in her voice clearly evident . " You should let me rid you of them all , " he said softly , one great hand coming to rest on her slim shoulder . " You should wash them away like yesterday 's sweat and start anew . " She nodded . " If it were that easy , I should call on you to help me . But I ca n't start over . It would be perceived as weakness by the governments of the nations I court . There can be no weakness in an Ard Rhys in these times . " She patted his hand . " Rise and walk with me . " They left the bluff and moved back into the trees , perfectly comfortable with each other and the night . The sights and sounds of Paranor disappeared , and the silence of the forest wrapped them close . The air was cool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring leaves , bearing the scent of woods and water . It would be summer before long , and the smells would change again . " What brings you here ? " she asked him finally , knowing he would wait for her to ask before speaking of it . He shook his head . " Something troubling . Something you may understand better than I do . " Even for a Rock Troll , Kermadec was huge , towering over her at close to seven feet , his powerful body sheathed in a barklike skin . He was all muscle and bone , strong enough to rip small trees out at the roots . She had never known a Troll to possess the strength and quickness of Kermadec . But there was much more to him . A Maturen of thirty years , he was the sort of person others turned to instinctively in times of trouble . Solid and capable , he had served his nation with a distinction and compassion that belied the ferocious history of his Race . In the not so distant past , the Trolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-minded intent of smashing them back into the earth . During the Wars of the Races , ruled by their feral and warlike nature , they had allied themselves with the darker forces in the world . But that was the past , and in the present , where it mattered most , they were no longer so easily bent to service in a cause that reason would never embrace . " You have come a long way to see me , Kermadec , " she said . " It must be something important . " " That remains for you to decide , " he said softly . " I myself have n't seen what I am about to reveal , so it is hard for me to judge . I think it will be equally hard for you . " " Tell me . " He slowed to a stop in the darkness and turned to face her . " There is strange activity in the ruins of the Skull Kingdom , mistress . The reports come not from Rock Trolls , who will not go into that forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ones who make a living in part by telling of what they see . What they see now is reminiscent of other , darker times . " " The Warlock Lord 's domain , once , " she observed . " A bad place still , all broken walls and scattered bones . Traces of evil linger in the smells and taste of the land . What do these creatures tell you they see ? " " Smoke and mirrors , of a sort . Fires lit in darkness and turned cold by daylight 's arrival . Small explosions of light that suggest something besides wood might be burning . Acrid smells that have no other source than the fires . Black smudges on flat stones that have the look of altars . Markings on those stones that might be symbols . Such events were sporadic at first , but now occur almost nightly . Strange things that of themselves alone do not trouble me , but taken all together do . " He breathed in and exhaled . " One thing more . Some among those who come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mist and smoke , things not of substance and not yet entirely formed , but recognizable as something more than the imagination . They flutter like caged birds seeking to be free . " Grianne went cold , aware of the possibilities that the sightings suggested . Something was being conjured up by use of magic , something that was n't natural to this world and that was being summoned to serve an unknown purpose . " How reliable are these stories ? " He shrugged . " They come from Gnomes for the most part , the only ones who go into that part of the world . They do so because they are drawn to what they perceive in their superstitions as sacred . They perform their rituals in those places because they feel it will lend them power . How reliable are they ? " He paused . " I think there is weight to what they say they see . " She thought a moment . Another strangeness to add to an already overcrowded agenda of strangenesses . She did not like the sound of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its reason , its source might lie uncomfortably close to home . Druids had the use of magic and were the most likely suspects , but their use of it in places beyond Paranor was forbidden . There were other possibilities , but this was the one she could not afford to ignore . " Is there a pattern to these happenings ? " she asked . " A timing to the fires and their leavings ? " He shook his head . " None that anyone has discerned . We could ask the Gnomes to watch for it , to mark the intervals . " " Which will take time , " she pointed out . " Time best spent looking into it myself . " She pursed her lips . " That is what you came to ask me to do , is n't it ? Take a look for myself ? " He nodded . " Yes , mistress . But I will go with you . Not alone into that country -- ever -- would I go . But with you beside me , I would brave the netherworld and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , Kermadec , she thought . Boasts have a way of coming back to haunt you . She thought of what she had committed herself to do in the days ahead . Meetings with various Druids to rework studies that members of the order would undertake . Those could wait . Overseeing the repairs to the library that concealed the Druid Histories -- that one could not happen without her presence , but could wait , as well . A delegation from the Federation was due to arrive in three days ; the Prime Minister of the Coalition was reputed to lead it . But she could be back in time for that if she left at once . She must go , she knew . She could not afford to leave the matter unattended to . It was the sort of thing that could mushroom into trouble on a much larger scale . Even by her appearance , she might dissuade those involved from pursuing their conjuring . Once they knew that she was aware of them , they might go to ground again . It was the best she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape Paranor and its madness for a few days . In the interval , perhaps a way to contend with the intrigues might occur to her . Time and distance often triggered fresh insights ; perhaps that would happen here . " Let me tell Tagwen , " she said to Kermadec , " and we 'll be off . " Chapter Two They departed Paranor at midnight , flying north out of the Druid forestlands with a full moon to light their way , riding the edge of their expectations just ahead of their doubts and fears . They chose to use Grianne 's War Shrike , Chaser , to make the journey , rather than a Druid airship , thinking that the Shrike would draw less attention and be less cumbersome . An airship required a crew , and a crew required explanations . Grianne preferred to keep secret what she was investigating until she better understood what it meant . Tagwen accepted the news of her sudden and mysterious departure stoically , but she read disapproval and concern in his eyes . He was desperate for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was about so that if the need arose , he might be able to help . But she thought it best he know only that she would be gone for a few days and he must see to her affairs as best he could . There would be questions , demands perhaps , but he could n't reveal what he did n't know . She braced his shoulders firmly with her hands , smiled her approval and reassurance , and slipped away . It went without saying that Tagwen would make no mention of Kermadec unless she failed to return ; a visit from the Rock Troll was always to be kept secret . There were too many who disapproved of the relationship , and the Dwarf understood the importance of not throwing fuel on a fire already dangerously hot . Grianne could depend on Tagwen to use good judgment in such matters . It was one of his strongest attributes ; his exercise of discretion and common sense was easily the equal of her own . Had he the inclination or the talent , he would have made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as happy to have him be what he was . The flight took the rest of the night and most of the following day , a long , steady sweep out of Callahorn and across the Streleheim to the peaks of the Knife Edge and the Razors , where the ruins of the Skull Kingdom lay scattered in the valley between . As she guided Chaser onward , the rush of air in her ears wrapping her in its mindless sound , she had plenty of time to think . Her thoughts were both of what lay ahead and behind . But while the former merely intrigued , the latter haunted . Her efforts at this new life had started so promisingly . She had returned to the Four Lands with such confidence , her identity regained , her life remade , the lies that had misled her replaced by truths . She had found her lost brother Bek , whom she had never thought to see again . She had broken the chains that the Morgawr had forged to hold her . She had fought and destroyed the warlock with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that she might be given a chance at the redemption she had never thought to find . The dying touch of a Druid , his blood on her forehead marking her as his successor , had set her on her path . It was a destiny she would never have chosen for herself but that she had come to believe was right and had therefore embraced . Walker , a shade with a shade 's vision , had reappeared to her at the Hadeshorn , and given her his blessing . Druids dead and gone passed in review , their shades materializing from the ether , rising out of the roiling waters , infusing her with their knowledge and a share of their collective power . She would rebuild their order , resuming the task that Walker had undertaken for himself and failed to complete . She would summon members of all the Races to a Third Druid Council and from it found a new order , one in which the dictates of a single Druid would no longer be all that stood between civilization and anarchy , between reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been required to make the difference . Those few who had done so -- Bremen , Allanon , and Walker -- had persevered because there had been no one else and no other way . She would change that . Such dreams . Such hopes . Ahren Elessedil had talked his brother , the Elven King Kylen Elessedil , into supplying the first of the new order , two handfuls of Elves Ahren had led to Paranor personally . After Kylen discovered he had been tricked , that Walker was dead and the hated Ilse Witch had replaced him , he had sought to recall those he had sent . But it was too late ; the Elves who had come were committed to her and beyond his reach . In retaliation he attempted to poison the minds of the leaders of the other Races against her at every opportunity . That did not prove to be too difficult with Sen Dunsidan , by then Prime Minister of the Federation , who already feared and detested her . But the Dwarves and Trolls were less easily persuaded , especially after she made the effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to insist that she would place the order at their disposal so far as it was possible to do so . Remember what the Druids were created to do , she kept reminding them . If you seek a source of strength in the cause of peace and goodwill among all nations , the Druids are the ones to whom you should turn . For a time , they did so . Members of both Races came to her , and some from Callahorn , as well , for they had heard good things about her from the Rover Captain Redden Alt Mer and from the Highlander Quentin Leah , men they respected . Besides , once they learned that the Federation did not support her , they were inclined to think that was reason enough for them to do so . The war between the Federation and the Free-born was still being fought , mighty armies still locked in combat on the Prekkendorran , leaders still waging a war that had been waged since the passing of Allanon -- a war pitting unification against independence , territorial rights against free will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Federation wanted it to be a part of the Southland . At times it had been both , at times neither . There was more to it , of course , as there always is in the case of wars between nations . But that was the justification most often given by those involved , and into the breach left by the absence of any sensible attempt to examine the matter stepped the Ard Rhys . It was a fateful decision , but one she did not see how she could avoid . The Federation-Free-born war was a ragged wound that would not heal . If the Races were ever to be brought together again , if the Druids were to be able to turn their attention to bettering the lives of the people of the Four Lands , this war must first be ended . So , even as she struggled to strike a balance in the diversity of temperaments and needs of those who came to Paranor to study the Druid ways , she was attempting , as well , to find a way to resolve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with the two leaders who hated her most -- Kylen Elessedil of the Elves and Sen Dunsidan of the Federation . It required that she put aside her own prejudices and find a way to get past theirs . She was able to do this in large part not through fear or intimidation but by making herself appear indispensable to them . After all , the Druids were still in possession of knowledge denied common men , more so than ever since the events in Parkasia . Neither man knew for certain what knowledge she had gained from the Old World that might prove invaluable . Neither understood how little of that knowledge she actually possessed . But perception is often more persuasive than truth . Without the Druids to offer support , each worried that crucial ground would be lost to the other . Without her help , each believed he risked allowing the other a chance to grow more powerful at his expense . Sen Dunsidan had always been a politician . Once he understood that she did not intend to revert to her ways as the Ilse Witch or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was more than willing to see what she had to offer . Kylen Elessedil followed along for no better reason than to keep pace with his enemy . Grianne played at this game because it was the only choice she had . She was as good at it now as she had been when she was the Ilse Witch and manipulation was second nature . It was a slow process . Mostly , she settled for crumbs in exchange for the prospect of a full loaf . At times , brought close by promises made and fitfully kept , she thought she would succeed in her efforts , her goal no more than a meeting away . Just a truce between the two would have opened the door to a more permanent solution . Both were strong men , and a small concession by one might have been enough to encourage the other to grant the same . She maneuvered them both toward making that concession , gaining time and credibility as she did so , making herself the center of their thinking as they edged toward a resolution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed on the Prekkendorran , the blame for it was laid at her doorstep , and in an instant everything she had worked for nearly six years to achieve was lost . When they stopped at midmorning to rest Chaser , Kermadec reopened the wound . " Has that boy King come to his senses yet , mistress ? " he asked in a tone of voice that suggested he already knew the answer . She shook her head . Kellen Elessedil was his father 's son and , if it was possible , liked her even less than his father had . Worse , he blamed her for his father 's death , a mindset she seemed unable to change . " He 's a fool . He 'll die in the same way , fighting for something that to right-thinking men makes no sense at all . " Kermadec snorted softly . " They say Rock Trolls are warlike , but history suggests that we are no worse than Men and Elves and in these times perhaps better . At least we do not carry on wars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war has been going on for much longer than that , " she said . " However long , it is still too long . " Kermadec stretched his massive arms over his head and yawned . " What is the point ? " It was a rhetorical question and she did n't bother to attempt an answer . It had been a dozen years since her efforts at finding a solution had broken down , and since then she had been preoccupied with troubles much closer to home . " You are due for a change of guards , " Kermadec offered , handing her his aleskin . " Maybe you should think about a change of Druids at the same time . " " Dismiss them all and start over ? " She had heard this argument from him before . Kermadec saw things in simple terms ; he thought she would be better off if she did so , too . " I ca n't do that . " " So you keep saying . " " Dismissing the order now would be perceived as weakness on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me most would have that effect . The nations look for an excuse to proclaim the Druid Council a failure , especially Sen Dunsidan and Kellen Elessedil . I can not give them one . Besides , if I had to start over at this point , no one would come to Paranor to aid me . All would shun the Druids . I have to make do with things as they are . " Kermadec took back the aleskin and looked out over the countryside . They were just at the edge of the Streleheim , facing north toward the misty , rugged silhouette of the Knife Edge . The day was bright and warm , and it promised another clear , moonlit night in which to explore the ruins of the Skull Kingdom . " You might think about the impracticality of that before you give up on my suggestion . " She had thought about alternatives frequently of late , although her thinking was more along the lines of restructuring and reordering so as to isolate those most troublesome . But even there she had to be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or they would begin to shift allegiance in ways that would undo her entirely . At times , she thought it might be best if she simply gave them all what they wanted , if she resigned her position and departed for good . Let another struggle with the problem . Let someone else take on her responsibilities and her obligations as Ard Rhys . But she knew she could n't do that . No one else had been asked to shoulder those responsibilities and obligations ; they had been given to her , and nothing had happened to change that . She could not simply walk away . She had no authority to do so . If Walker 's shade should appear to tell her it was time , she would be gone in a heartbeat -- though perhaps not without disappointment at having failed to accomplish her task . But neither Walker 's nor the shade of any other Druid had come to her . Until she was discharged , she could not go . The dissatisfaction of others was not enough to set her free . Her solution to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ilse Witch . She would have made an example of the more troublesome members of her order and cowed the rest by doing so . She would not have hesitated to eliminate her problems in a way that would have appalled even Kermadec . But she had lived enough of that life , and she would never go back to it . An Ard Rhys must find other , better ways to act . By late afternoon , they had crossed the Streleheim and flown through the lower wall of the Knife Edge into the jagged landscape of the Skull Kingdom . She felt a change in the air long before she saw one on the ground . Even aboard Chaser , several hundred feet up , she could sense it . The air became dead and old , smelling and tasting of devastation and rot . There was no life here , not of a sort anyone could recognize . The mountain was gone , brought down by cataclysmic forces on the heads of those who had worked their evil within it , reduced to a jumble of rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a ruined land , colorless and barren even now , a thousand years later , and it was likely to be a thousand more before that changed . Even in the wake of a volcano 's eruption , in the path of the resultant lava flow , life eventually returned , determined and resilient . But not here . Here , life was denied . Ignoring the look and feel of the place , even though it settled about them with oppressive insistence , they circled the ruins in search of the site where the fires and the flashes had been observed . After about an hour they found it at one end of a long shelf of rock balanced amid a cluster of spikes that jutted like bones from the earth . A ring of stones encircled a fire pit left blackened and slick from whatever had been burned . When Grianne first saw it from the air , she could not imagine how anyone could even manage to get to it , let alone make use of it . Rock barriers rose all about , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as glass . Then she amended her thinking . It would take a Shrike or a Roc or a small , highly maneuverable airship to gain access , but access could be gained . Which had been used in this instance ? She stored the question away to be pondered later . Guiding Chaser to one end of the shelf , they dismounted and walked back for a closer look . " Sacrifices of some sort , " Kermadec observed , glancing around uneasily , his big shoulders swinging left and right , as if he were caged . He did not like being there , she knew , even with her . The place held bad memories for Trolls , even after so long . The Warlock Lord might be dead and gone , but the feel of him lingered . In the history of the Trolls , no one had done more damage to the nation 's psyche . Trolls were not superstitious in the manner of Gnomes , but they believed in the transference of evil from the dead to the living . They believed because they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . She closed her eyes and cast about with her other senses for a moment , trying to read in the air what had happened here . She tracked the leavings of a powerful magic , the workings of a sorcery that was not meant to heal or succor . A summoning of some sort , she read in the bits and pieces that remained . To what end , though ? She could not determine , though the smells told of something dying , and not quickly . She looked down at the fire pit and read in the greasy smears dark purpose in the sacrifices clearly made . " This is n't good , " she said softly . He stepped close . " What do you find , mistress ? " " Nothing yet . Nothing certain . " She looked up at him , into his flat , expressionless features . " Perhaps tonight , when darkness cloaks the thing that finds this dead place so attractive , we shall find out . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
