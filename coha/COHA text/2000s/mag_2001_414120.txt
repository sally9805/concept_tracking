Celebrate your unique style by fitting your home with treasures close to your heart . // We all long for a home that is a haven  --  a retreat to nurture us and to restore our mental health . One way of creating this type of refuge is to surround ourselves with items that link us to the people , places , and memories we love . Here we take a look at two different homes , both filled with furnishings and accessories that serve as reminders of what is most important in life .

They created a home with a beautifully clean , comfortable look by keeping only what David really liked , and by employing furnishings and accessories substantial enough to stand on their own . Several items had been passed down from family members and held sentimental value . A chest and mirror belonged to David 's grandparents . The dining room table had been his parents ' . " I love this table . It reminds me of meals at my dad 's house , " he says . David 's family ties are reflected in the art he collects as well . He displays several watercolors by his mother in his bedroom , and two oil paintings by his grandfather hang over the mantel . Jenny grouped these oil paintings as an unexpected pair , with the horizontal hanging over the vertical . Together they become a true focal point for the room . Some of David 's favorite accessories are n't family heirlooms but inexpensive finds he purchased just because he was drawn to them , such as a pair of tropical  --  themed oils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking advantage of good proportion , David 's home is simplistic and yet makes a strong style statement .

" While my friends were getting 8-track tapes for Christmas , I was getting old lawn-bowling balls and antique cue balls , " he says with a laugh . While Rick inherited his mother 's sense of style , Pam , too , is design savvy . Even the children ( 15-year-old Callie , 13-year-old Chandler , and 11 - year- old Richard ) have contributed prized pieces of art that are prominently displayed throughout their home . Rooms are accented by favorite collections . " Years ago , we were given a box inlaid with wood that I just loved , " recalls Pam . That one gift generated an entire grouping .
