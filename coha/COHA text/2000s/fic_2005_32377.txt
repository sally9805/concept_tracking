City of the Dead By Brian Keene Dorchester Publishing Brian Keene Jim , Martin , and Frankie stared into the distance . A cemetery stretched off to the horizon along both sides of New Jersey 's Garden State Parkway , and the highway cut right through the graveyard 's center . Thousands of tombstones thrust upward to the sky , surrounded by tenements and overgrown vacant lots . Tombs and crypts also dotted the landscape , but the sheer number of gravestones almost overwhelmed them . Jim said , " I remember this place . It used to freak me out every time I drove up here to pick up Danny or drop him off . Creepy , is n't it ? " " It 's something all right , " Frankie gasped . " I 've never seen so many tombstones in one place . It 's fucking huge ! " The old preacher whispered something beneath his breath . " What 'd you say , Martin ? " He stared across the sea of marble and granite . " I said that this is our world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frankie nodded in agreement . " As far as the eye can see . " " How long after all these buildings crumble , " Martin sighed , " will these tombstones remain standing ? How long after we 're gone will the dead remain ? " Martin shook his head sadly . They finished examining the Humvee for any damage suffered during their last battle with the dead . Then they continued on their way . As the sun began to set , its last , faint rays shoneupon the sign in front of them . BLOOMINGTON-NEXT EXIT Jim began to hyperventilate . " Take that exit . " Martin turned around , concerned . " Are you okay , Jim ? What is it ? " Jim clenched the seat , gasping for air . He felt nauseous . His pulse pounded in his chest and his skin grew cold . " I 'm scared , " he whispered . " Martin , I 'm just so scared . I do n't know what 's going to happen . " Frankie cruised down the exit ramp and flicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed a sigh of relief . " Which way ? " Jim did n't answer , and they were unsure if he 'd even heard her . His eyes were squeezed shut , and he 'd begun to tremble . " Hey , " Frankie shouted from the front seat , " you want to see your kid again ? Snap the fuck out of it and get your shit together . Now which way ? " Jim opened his eyes . " Sorry , you 're right . Go to the bottom of the ramp and make a left at the red light . Go up three blocks and then make a right onto Chestnut . There 's a big church and a video store on the corner . " Jim exhaled , long and deep , and began to move again . He sat the rifles aside and double-checked the pistol , shoving it back into the holster after he was satisfied . He pressed himself into the seat and waited , while his son 's neighborhood flashed by outside . A zombie wearing a tattered delivery uniform jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baseball bat in its grimy hands . " There 's one . " Martin rolled down the window enough to squeeze off a shot . " No , " Frankie said , stopping him . " Do n't shoot at them unless they directly threaten us or look like they 're following . " " But that one will tell others , " he protested . " The last thing we need to do is attract more ! " " Which is exactly why you do n't need to be shooting at it , preacher . By the time it tells its rotten little friends that the lunch wagon is here , we can grab his boy and get the fuck out . You start shooting and every zombie in this town is gon na know we 're here and where to come find us ! " " You 're right , " Martin nodded , and rolled the window back up . " Good thinking . " An obese zombie waddled by , dressed in a kimono and pulling a child 's red wagon behind her . Another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and few remaining entrails and yellow curds of fat spilling out around it . Both creatures grew agitated as they sped by , and the fat zombie loped along behind them , fists raised in anger . Frankie slammed on the brake , slammed the Humvee into reverse , and backed up , crushing both the zombies and the wagon under the wheels . The vehicle rocked from the jolt . She grinned at Martin . " Now was n't that much quieter than a gunshot ? " The preacher shuddered . Jim barely noticed either of his companions . His pulse continued to race , but the nausea was gone , replaced with a hollow emptiness . How many times had he driven down this same suburban street , either to pick Danny up or to take him home ? Dozens , but never suspecting that one day he 'd do so armed to the teeth and riding in a hijacked military vehicle with a preacher and an ex-hooker . He remembered the first time , right after his first complete summer with Danny . Danny started crying when Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The big tears rolled down his little face when they pulled into the driveway , and were still flowing when Jim reluctantly drove away . He 'd watched Danny through the rear-view mirror and waited until he was out of sight before he pulled over and broke down himself . He thought of Danny 's birth . The doctor placed him in his arms for the first time . He 'd been so small and tiny , his pink skin still wet . His infant son crying then too , and when Jim cooed to him , Danny opened his eyes and smiled . The doctors and Tammy insisted it was n't a smile , that babies could n't smile ; but deep down inside , Jim had known better . He thought of the summers that he and his second wife , Carrie , spent with Danny . The three of them had played Uno , and Danny and Carrie caught him cheating , hiding ' Draw Four ' cards under the table in his lap . They 'd wrestled him to the floor , tickling him till he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch together , eating popcorn and watching Godzilla and Mecha-Godzilla trash Tokyo . The message that Danny had left on his cell phone a week ago echoed through his mind as they turned a corner . " I 'm on Chestnut , " Frankie reported , " now what ? " ' I 'm scared Daddy . I know we should n't leave the attic , but Mommy 's sick and I do n't know how to make her better . I hear things outside the house . Sometimes they just go by and other times I think they 're trying to get in . I think Rick is with them . ' " Jim ? JIM ! " Jim 's voice was quiet and far away . " Past O'Rourke and Fischer , then make a left onto Platt Street . It 's the last house on the left . " In his head , Danny was crying . ' Daddy , you promised to call me ! I 'm scared and I do n't know what to do .... ' " Platt Street , " Frankie announced and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined up in neat rows , each one identical to the next , save for the color of their shutters or the curtains hanging in the vacant windows . " We 're here . " She put the Humvee in park and left the engine running . ' ... and I love you more than Spider-Man and more than Pikachu and more than Michael Jordan and more than ' finity , Daddy . I love you more than infinity . ' The phrase had haunted him over the last few days , resonating with double meaning . It had been a game he and Danny had shared , something to ease the pain of long distance phone calls from West Virginia to New Jersey . But one of the zombie 's he 'd faced had also used the phrase . " We are many . Our number is greater than the stars . We are more than infinity . " Jim opened his eyes . " More than infinity , Danny . Daddy loves you more than infinity . " He opened the door and Martin followed . Jim placed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the seat . " No , " he said firmly , shaking his head , " you stay with Frankie . I need you to watch our backs out here . Make sure we 've got a clear shot at escape . I 'm going to leave the rifles here with you guys-just in case . " He paused , and still squeezing Martin 's shoulder , raised his head and sniffed the breeze . " This town is alive with the dead , Martin . Can you smell them ? " " I can , " the preacher admitted , " but you 'll need help . What if- " " I appreciate everything you 've done for me and Danny , but this is something I have to do alone . " " I 'm afraid for what you might find . " " So am I. That 's why I need to do this by myself . Okay ? " Martin was reluctant . " Okay . We 'll wait here for both of you . " Frankie leaned over the seat and pulled one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs and checked the rear view mirror . " Coast is clear , " she said . " Better get going . " Jim nodded . Martin sighed . " Good luck , Jim . We 'll be right here . " " Thank you . Thank you both . " He took a deep breath , turned away , and crossed the street . His feet felt leaden , his hands numb . Gripping the pistol , he shook it off and clenched his jaw . " More than infinity , Danny ... " He broke into a run , his boots pounding on the sidewalk as he sprinted for the house . He turned into the yard , dashed onto the porch and drew the pistol from its holster . Hand trembling , he reached out and tried the doorknob . It was unlocked . Slowly , Jim turned it . Calling his son 's name , he went inside the house . * * * They waited in the darkness . Martin had n't realized he was holding his breath until Jim vanished through the front door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " " We wait , " he told her . " We wait and we watch for them to come out . " The night air turned chilly , and it whistled through the hole in the ruined windshield . Frankie shivered . Jim had been right . There was something foul on the breeze . " So how old is Danny , anyway ? " " Six , " Martin answered . " He was-I mean is-a cute kid . Looks like Jim . " " You saw a picture ? " He nodded . " How long you two been traveling together ? " " Since West Virginia . Jim got attacked outside my church . I saved him and then promised to help him find his son . " Frankie was quiet for a moment . Then she spoke again . " Tell me something , preacher-man . Do you really think his son is alive in there ? " Martin watched the house . " I hope so , Frankie . I hope . " " Me too . I think that ... " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards again . Carefully , she hefted the rifle . The stench was getting stronger . " What is it ? " Martin asked . " Ca n't you smell them ? They 're coming . " Martin cracked his window and sniffed the air , his nose wrinkling in disgust . " I reckon they know we 're here , somewhere . They 're hunting for us . " " What should we do ? " " Like I said , we wait . Not much else we can do . Just be ready . " They grew quiet again and watched the silent houses around them . Martin turned back to Danny 's house . His jittery legs bounced up and down and he cracked his leathery knuckles in the dark . His arthritis was acting up and he doubted he 'd find any medicine lying around for it soon . " Stop fidgeting . " " Sorry . " Random Bible verses ran through his head and Martin focused on them so that he would not have to wonder what was going on inside the house . Blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the world that He gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believes in Him , shall not perish , but have eternal life ... And on the third day , he arose from the dead ... Martin glanced back at the house again , fighting the urge to get out of the Humvee and run towards it . He thought of the father and son that saved them from cannibals in Virginia . The father had been mortally wounded and before he could turn into a zombie , the son shot him and then turned the gun on himself . He gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believes in Him , shall not perish , but have eternal life ... And on the third day , he arose from the dead ... ... His only begotten son ... he arose from the dead ... ... His only son ... arose from the dead ... Martin froze . " Frankie , I- " A gunshot suddenly rang out , shattering the stillness . It was followed by a scream . Silence returned and then a second gunshot followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankie , that was Jim screaming ! " " Are you sure ? It did n't sound human to me . " " It was him ! I 'm sure of it . " " What do we do now ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know ! " Martin 's mind whirled . He shot Danny and then himself ! He got in there , and Danny was a zombie . His only begotten son arose from the dead ! Frankie shook him . " Fuck this shit ! Come on , Reverend ! " They jumped out of the Humvee , weapons at the ready , as the first cries of the undead drifted to them on the night wind . The zombies appeared at the end of the street and the doors to the houses began to open at the same time . The undead poured forth . Martin 's voice cracked . " It-it was a trap . L-look at all of them ... " " Shit . " Frankie raised the M-16 , aimed and fired three shots in quick succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a horrendous cry , the zombies charged . Martin turned back to the Humvee , but Frankie grabbed his arm . " Move your ass , preacher-man ! " They ran toward the house , to see what had become of their friend . More gunshots echoed from inside as they approached . Above them , the newly risen moon shined down upon the world , staring at a mirror image of its cold , dead self .
