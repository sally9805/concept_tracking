Through the Hedge He stood at the kitchen window and watched her coming through the hedge . What was she lugging this time ? It appeared to be a bowl and pitcher . Or was it a stack of books topped by a vase ? The rector took off his glasses , fogged them , and wiped them with his handkerchief . It was a bowl and pitcher , all right . How the little yellow home next door had contained all the stuff they 'd recently muscled into the rectory was beyond him . " For your dresser , " she said , as he held the door open . " Aha ! " The last thing he wanted was a bowl and pitcher on his dresser . The top of his dresser was his touchstone , his home base , his rock in a sea of change . That was where his car keys resided , his loose coins , his several crosses , his cuff links , his wallet , his checkbook , his school ring , and a small jar of buttons with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror in which he occasionally examined the top of his head . Was his hair still thinning , or , by some mysterious and hoped-for reversal , growing in again ? " Cynthia , " he said , going upstairs in the wake of his blond and shapely wife , " about that bowl and pitcher ... " " The color is wonderful . Look at the blues . It will relieve all your burgundy and brown ! " He did not want his burgundy and brown relieved . * * * He saw it coming . Eversince their marriage on September seventh , she had plotted to lug that blasted armoire over for the rectory guest room . The lugging over was one thing ; it was the lugging back that he dreaded . They had , for example , lugged over an oriental rug that was stored in her basement . " Ten by twelve ! " she announced , declaring it perfect for the bare floor of the rectory dining room . After wrestling the table and chairs into the hall , they had unrolled the rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone up the walls on all four sides and met at the chandelier over the table . " This is a rug for a school gym ! " he said , wiping the pouring sweat from his brow . She seemed dumbfounded that it did n't fit , and there they had gone , like pack mules , carting it through the hedge again . The decision to keep and use both houses had been brilliant , of course . The light in the rectory would never equal that of her studio next door , where she was already set up with books and paints and drawing board . This meant his study could remain unchangedhis books could occupy the same shelves , and his vast store of sermon notebooks in the built-in cabinets could hold their place . Marrying for the first time at the age of sixtysomething was change enough . It was a blessed luxury to live with so few rearrangements in the scheme of things , and life flowing on as usual . The only real change was the welcome sharing of bed and board . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in getting the furniture settled . " Why ca n't we keep things as they were ... in their existing state ? It seemed to work .... " " Yes , well , I like that our houses are separate , but I also want them to be the samesort of an organic whole . " " No organic whole will come of dragging that armoire back and forth through the hedge . It looks like a herd of elephants has passed through there already . " " Oh , Timothy ! Stop being stuffy ! Your place needs fluffing up , and mine needs a bit more reserve . For example , your Chippendale chairs would give a certain sobriety to my dining table . " " Your dining table is the size of something in our nursery school . My chairs would look gigantic . " She said exactly what he thought she would say . " We could try it and see . " " Cynthia , trust me on this . My chairs will not look right with your table , and neither will that hand-painted magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what was the use of getting married , then ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " I mean , if no one is going to change on either side , if we 're both just going to be our regular , lifetime selves , what 's the use ? " " I think I see what you 're getting at . Will nothing do , then , but to cart those chairs to your house ? And what about my own table ? It will be bereft of chairs . I hardly see the point . " He felt like jumping through the window and going at a dead run toward the state line . " One thing at a time , " she said happily . " It 's all going to work out perfectly . " dear Stuart , thanx for your note re : diocesan mtg , and thank martha for the invitation to put my feet under yr table afterward , however , I must leave for home at once , following the mtghope you 'll understand . while i 'm at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving things around ? at Sunday School , jena iivey just had the youth group move the kindergarten bookcases to a facing wall . on the homefront , my househelp has moved a ladderback chair from my bedroom into the hall , never once considering that i hung my trousers over it for 14 years , and put my shoes on the seat so they could be found in an emergency . last but certainly not least , if C could lift me in my armchair and put it by the window while i 'm dozing , she would do it . without a doubt , you have weightier things to consider , but tell me , how does one deal with this ? i hasten to add that ii 've never been happier in my life . to tell the truth , i am confounded that such happinessin such measureeven exists . He signed the note , typed on his Royal manual , thankful that Stuart Cullen was not merely his bishop , but his closest personal friend since the halcyon days of seminary . Fr Timothy Kavanaugh , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitford , N.C. Dear Timothy : In truth , it is disconcerting when one 's househelp , SS supervisor , and wife do this sort of thing all at once . My advice is : do not fight it . It will wear off . In His peace , Stuart P.S. Martha would add a note , but she is busy moving my chest of drawers to the far side of our bedroom . As I am dealing with an urgent matter with the House of Bishops , I could not be browbeaten to help , and so she has maneuvered it , at last , onto an old bedspread , and I can hear her hauling the whole thing across the floor above me . This particular behavior had lain dormant in her for nearly seven years , and has suddenly broken forth again . Perhaps it is something in the water . * * * He could see , early on , that beds were a problem that needed working out . They had spent their wedding night in his bed at the rectory , where they had rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is this trough doing in your bed ? " she asked . " It 's where I sleep , " he said , feeling sheepish . They had been squeezed together like sardines the livelong night , which he had profoundly enjoyed , but she had not . " Do you think this is what 's meant by the two shall be one flesh ' ? " she murmured , her cheek smashed against his . The following night , he trooped through the hedge with his pajamas and toothpaste in a grocery bag from The Local . Her bed was a super-king-size , and the largest piece of furniture in her minuscule house . He found it similar in breadth to the state of Texas , or possibly the province of Saskatchewan . Was that a herd of buffalo racing toward him in the distance , or a team of sled dogs ? " Cynthia ! " he shouted across the vast expanse , and waited for the echo . They had ordered a new mattress for the rectory immediately after returning from their honeymoon in Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of Maine , they had spent time listening to the cry of the loons , holding hands , walking along the shore , and talking until the small hours of the morning . The sun turned her fair skin a pale toast color that he found fascinating and remarkable ; and he watched three freckles emerge on the bridge of her nose , like stars coming out . Whatever simple thing they did together , they knew they were happier than ever before in their lives . One evening , soon after the new mattress and springs were installed at the rectory , he found her sitting up in bed as he came out of the shower . " I 've had a wonderful idea , Timothy ! A fireplace ! Right over there where the dresser is . " " What would I do with my dresser ? " She looked at him as if he had toddled in from the church nursery . " Put it in the alcove , of course . " " Then I could n't see out the window . " " But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " When you were parading about with Andrew Gregory , a great deal of time . " His face burned to admit it , but yes , he 'd been jealous of the handsome antique dealer who had squired her around for several months . She smiled , leaning her head to one side in that way he could barely resist . " A fireplace would be so romantic . " " Ummm . " " Why must I be the romantic in the family while you hold up the conservative , **28;0;TOOLONG end ? " He sat down beside her . " How quickly you forget . When we were going steady , you said I was wildly romantic . " She laughed and kissed him on the cheek . " And I was right , of course . I 'm sorry , old dearest . " He regretted being anyone 's old dearest . " Old dearest , yourself , " he said grumpily . " I am , after all , only six years your senior . " " By the calendar , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his overall attitude about life . In any case , the fireplace issue did not come up again . * * * In truth , he had no words for his happiness . It grew deeper every day , like the digging of a well , and astounded him by its warmth and power . He seemed to lose control of his very face , which , according to the regulars at the Main Street Grill , displayed a foolish and perpetual grin . " I love you ... terribly , " he said , struggling to express it . " I love you terribly , also . It 's scary . What if it should end ? " " Cynthia , good grief ... " " I know I should n't talk of endings when this is a blessed beginning . " " Do n't then , " he said , meaning it . * * * That Barnabas had so willingly given up the foot of his master 's bed to sleep on a rug in the hall was a gesture he would never forget . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly bath without rancor , his dog was a gentleman . * * * The decisions were made , and both parties were in amicable accord . They would sleep at the rectory primarily , and on occasion at the little yellow house . Though she would work there , as always , they would treat it much as a second home , using it for refreshment and private retreat . He promised to have his sermon well under control each Saturday afternoon , with time to relax with her on Saturday evening , and he would continue to make breakfast on Sunday morning . He showed her where his will was , and promised to have it rewritten . She confessed she did n't have a will , and promised to have one drawn up . If they should ever , God forbid , have a misunderstanding , neither would dash off to the other house to sulk . He would continue to have the cheerful and enterprising Puny Guthrie , ne Bradshaw , clean the rectory three days a week , and Cynthia would use her services on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their separate checking accounts , make some mutual investments , counsel with the other about gift offerings , and never spend more than a certain fixed sum without the other 's prior agreement . He suggested fifty dollars as the fixed sum . " One hundred ! " she countered . He was glad he had opened the bidding low . " One hundred , then , and I keep that old jacket you earmarked for the Bane and Blessing sale . " " Done ! " They laughed . They shook hands . They felt relieved . Getting a marriage off on the right foot was no small matter . * * * " I reckon you 're gone with th ' wind , " said Percy Mosely , who rang up his lunch tab at the Main Street Grill . " How 's that ? " asked the rector . " Married an ' all , you 'll not be comin ' in regular , I take it . " The proprietor of the Grill felt hurt and betrayed , he could tell . " You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Percy , brightening . " I 'll be coming in as regular as any man could . My wife has a working life of her own , being a well-known children 's book writer and illustrator . She will not be trotting out hot vittles for my lunch every daynot by a long shot . " Percy looked suspicious . " What about breakfast ? " " That , " said the rector , pocketing the change , " is another matter entirely . " Percy frowned . He liked his regulars to be married to his place of business . * * * He looked up from his chair in the study . Curlers , again . " I have to wear curlers , " she said , as if reading his mind . " I 'm going to Lowell tomorrow . " " Lowell ? Whatever for ? " " A school thing . They want me to read Violet Goes to France to their French class , and then do a program in the auditorium . " " Must you ? " " Must I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they asked me to read . " " No , must you go to Lowell ? " " Well , yes . " He did n't want to say anything so idiotic , but he would miss her , as if she were being dropped off the end of the earth . A long silence ensued as she curled up on the sofa and opened a magazine . He tried to read , but could n't concentrate . He had n't once thought of her traveling with her work . Uneasy , he tried to let the news sink in . Lowell . Somebody there had been shot on the street in broad daylight . And another thingLowell was a full hundred miles away . Did she have good brakes ? Plenty of gas ? When had she changed her oil ? " How 's your oil ? " he asked soberly . She laughed as if he 'd said something hilariously funny . Then she left the sofa and came to him and kissed him on the forehead . He was instantly zapped by the scent of wisteria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eye . " I love it when you talk like that . My oil is fine , how 's yours ? " " Cynthia , Cynthia , " he said , pulling her into his lap . * * * " Guess what ? " said Emma , who was taping a photo of her new grandchild on the wall next to her desk . This was his secretary 's favorite game , and one he frankly despised . " What ? " " Guess ! " " Let 's see . You 're going to quit working for the Episcopalians and go to work for the Baptists . " He wished . " I wish , " she said , rolling her eyes , " Try again . " " Blast , Emma , I hate this game . " It 's good for you , it exercises the brain . " " Esther Bolick 's orange marmalade cake recipe is coming out in the New York Times food section . " " See ? You do n't even try . You 're just talking to hear your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a clue . " " It has to do with somebody being mad . " " The vestry . It must have something to do with the vestry . " " Wrong . Do you want me to tell you ? " " I beg you . " " Marge Wheeler left her best basket in the kitchen after the bishop 's brunch last June , and Flora Lou Wilcox put it in the Bane and Blessing sale . Somebody walked off with it for a hundred dollars ! Can you believe a hundred dollars for a basket with a loose handle ? Marge is mad as a wet hen , she threatened to sue . But Flora Lou said she does n't have a leg to stand on , since you 're always running notices in the pew bulletin to pick up stuff left in th ' kitchen . " " Ummm . Keep me posted . " " It 's been four months since the brunch , so I can see Flora Lou 's point that Marge should have picked it up and carted it home . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navajo Indians in 1920 ? " Emma sighed . " Of course , I can see Marge 's point , too , ca n't you ? " He could , but he knew better than to intervene unless asked . His job , after all , was Sales and Service . He rifled through the mail . A note from his cousin , Walter , and wife , Katherine , who had done the Ireland jaunt with him last year . Dear Timothy , Since Ireland is now old stomping grounds , why do n't you and Cynthia plan to go with us next summer ? Thought we 'd plant the seed , so it can sprout over the winter . We shall never forget how handsome you looked on the other side of the pulpit , standing with your beautiful bride . We love her as much as we love you , which is pecks and bushels , as ever , Katherine PS , Pls advise if canna and lily bulbs should be separated in the fall , I 'm trying to find a hobby that has nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the mail stack . Aha ! A note from Dooley Barlowe , in that fancy prep school for which his eldest parishioner , Miss Sadie Baxter , was shelling out serious bucks . Hey . I do n't like it here . That brain in a jar that we saw is from a medical school . I still do n't know whose brain it is . When are you coming back ? Bring Barnbus and granpaw and Cynthia . I culd probly use a twenty . Dooley There ! Not one ai n't , ' and complete sentences throughout . Hallelujah ! Who could have imagined that this boy , once barely able to speak the King 's English , would end up in a prestigious school in Virginia ? He gazed at the note , shaking his head . Scarcely more than two years ago , Dooley Barlowe had arrived at the church office , dirty , ragged , and barefoot , looking for a place to " take a dump . " His grandfather had been too ill to care for the boy , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dooley had ended up at the rectory . By grace alone , he and Dooley had managed to live through those perilous times . " I 've been wondering , " said Emma , peering at him over her glasses , " Is Cynthia goin ' to pitch in and help around the church ? " " She 's free to do as much or as little as she pleases . " " I 've always thought a preacher 's wife should pitch in . " She set her mouth in that way he deplored . " If you ask me , which you did n't , the parish will expect it . " Yes , indeed , if he could get the Baptists to take Emma Newland off his hands , he would be a happy man . * * * " Miss Sadie , " he said when she answered the phone at Fernbank . " I 've had a note from Dooley . He says he does n't like it in that fancy school . " " He can like it or lump it , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , you sure can be tough , Miss Sadie . " " If I could n't be tough , Father , I would n't have twenty thousand to dish out . " " You 'll be glad to know the headmaster says he 's doing all right . A little slow on the uptake , but holding his own with those rich kids . In fact , they 're not all rich . Several are there on scholarship , with no more assets than our Dooley . " " Good ! You mark my words , he 'll be better for it . And do n't you go soft on me , Father , and let him talk you into bailing him out in the middle of the night . " " You can count on it , " he said . " Louella and I have nearly recovered from all the doings in June .... " " June was a whopper , all right . " " We 're no spring chickens , you know . " " You could have fooled me . " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her age . Anyway , we 're going to have you and Cynthia up for supper . What did we say we 'd have , Louella ? " He heard Louella 's mezzo voice boom from a corner of the big kitchen , " Fried chicken , mashed potatoes , gravy , an ' cole slaw ! " " Man ! " he exclaimed , quoting Dooley . The announcement rolled on . " Hot biscuits , cooked apples , deviled eggs , bread and butter pickles ... " Good Lord ! The flare-up from his diabetes would have him in the emergency room before the rest of them pushed back from the table . " And what did we say for dessert ? " Miss Sadie warbled into the distance . " Homemade coconut cake ! " Ah , well , that was a full coma right there . Hardly any of his parishioners could remember he had this blasted disease . The information seemed to go in one ear and out the other . " Ask Louella if she 'll marry me , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry him . " " Tell ' im he got a short mem'ry , he done married Miss Cynthia . " He laughed , contented with the sweetness of this old friendship . " Just name the time , " he said . " We 'll be there . " * * * Autumn drew on in the mountains . Here , it set red maples on fire ; there , it turned oaks russet and yellow . Fat persimmons became the color of melted gold , waiting for frost to turn their bitter flesh to honey . Sassafras , dogwoods , poplars , redbudall were torched by autumn 's brazen fire , displaying their colorful tapestry along every ridge and hogback , in every cove and gorge . The line of maples that marched by First Baptist to Winnie Ivey 's cottage on Little Mitford Creek was fully ablaze by the eleventh of October . " The best ever ! " said several villagers , who ran with their cameras to document the show . The local newspaper editor , J. C. Hogan , shot an extravagant total of six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's bicentennial , readers saw a four-color photograph on the front page of the Mitford Muse . Everywhere , the pace was quickened by the dazzling light that now slanted from the direction of Gabriel Mountain , and the sounds of football practice in the schoolyard . Avis Packard put a banner over the green awning of The Local : Fresh Valley Hams Now , Collards Coming . Dora Pugh laid on a new window at the hardware store featuring leaf rakes , bicycle pumps , live rabbits , and iron skillets . " What 's th ' theme of your window ? " someone asked . " Life , " replied Dora . The library introduced its fall reading program and invited the author of the Violet books to talk about where she got her ideas . " I have no idea where I get my ideas , " she told Avette Harris , the librarian . " They just come . " " Well , then , " said Avette , " do you have any ideas for another topic ? " The village churches agreed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to get their youth choirs together for a Christmas performance at First Presbyterian . At Lord 's Chapel , the arrangements on the altar became gourds and pumpkins , accented by branches of the fiery red maple . At this time of year , the rector himself liked doing the floral offerings . He admitted it was a favorite season , and his preaching , someone remarked , grew as electrified as the sharp , clean air . " Take them , " he said one Sunday morning , lifting the cup and the Host toward the people , " in remembrance that Christ died for you , and feed on Him in your hearts by faith , with thanksgiving . " Giving his own wife the Host was an act that might never cease to move and amaze him . More than sixty years a bachelor , and now thisseeing her face looking up expectantly , and feeling the warmth of her hand as he placed the bread in her palm . " The body of our Lord Jesus Christ , which was given for you , Cynthia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored light that fell on her hair through the stained-glass window by the rail , as if she were being appointed to something divine . Surely there could be no divinity in having to live the rest of her life with him , with his set-in-concrete ways and infernal diabetes . They walked home together after church , hand in hand , his sermon notebook tucked under his arm . He felt as free as a schoolboy , as light as air . How could he ever have earned God 's love , and hers into the bargain ? The point was , he could n't . It was all grace , and grace alone . * * * He was sitting in his armchair by the fireplace , reading the newspaper . Barnabas ambled in from the kitchen and sprawled at his feet . Cynthia , barefoot and in her favorite robe , sat on the sofa and scribbled in a notebook . One of his antiquated towels was wrapped around her damp hair . He still could n't get over the sight of her on his sofa , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often amazed to realize , she did . " Was n't it wonderful ? " she asked . " Was n't what wonderful ? " " Our wedding . " " It was ! " She brought the subject up fairly often , and he realized he 'd run out of anything new to say about it . " I love thinking about it , " she said , plumping up a needlepoint pillow and putting it behind her head . " A tuxedo and a tab collar are a terrific combination . " " No kidding ? " He would remember that . " I think you should dress that way again at the first possible opportunity . " He laughed . " It does n't take much for you . " " That 's true , dearest , except in the area of my new husband . There , it took quite a lot . " He felt that ridiculous , uncontrollable grin spreading across his face . " It was a wonderful idea to ask Dooley to sing . He was absolutely masterful . And thank goodness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you and Stuart in his bishop 's regalia , standing in the churchyard ... and the part where Miss Sadie and Preacher Greer are laughing together . " " Another case of two hearts beating as one . " " Would you like to see it again ? I 'll make popcorn . " " Maybe in a day or two . " Had n't they watched it only last week ? " It was very sweet and charming , the way you insisted on baking a ham for our reception . " " I always bake a ham for wedding receptions at Lord 's Chapel , " he said . " I 'm stuck in that mode . " " Tell me something ... ? " " Anything ! " Would he really tell her anything ? " How did you unstick your mode long enough to propose to me ? What happened ? " " I realized ... that is , I ... " He paused thoughtfully and rubbed his chin . " To tell the truth , I could n't help myself . " " Ummm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know I love that you knelt on one knee . " " Actually , I was prepared to go down on both knees . As soon as I dropped to one , however , you saw what was coming , and seemed so happy about it , I did n't bother to advance to the full kneel . " She laughed uproariously , and held her arms out to him . " Please come over here , dearest . You 're so far away over there ! " The evening news was just coming on when the phone rang . It was his doctor and friend , Hoppy Harper , calling from the hospital . " How fast can you get here ? " " Well ... " " I 'll explain later . Just get here . " He was out the door in thirty seconds .
