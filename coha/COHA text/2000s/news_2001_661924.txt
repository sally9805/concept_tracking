In a sprawling office perched atop an empire he no longer rules , the man once called Captain Outrageous is cowering - chin on his knees , hands clasped over his head . <p> Ted Turner is obsessed with nuclear weapons , with their potential for blowing the world into bits , even after the Cold War . At the moment , he is demonstrating a 1950s civil-defense drill for schoolchildren : " Duck and cover , " he says . <p> Ten years ago , Turner ducked from no one . He was the self-styled " Mouth of the South , " Time 's Man of the Year , the mogul who turned the globe into a village that watched itself on cable 24 hours a day . <p> Now , his title is vice chairman and senior adviser of AOL Time Warner , a corporate monster two mega-mergers removed from swallowing up the broadcasting empire that bore his name . <p> " If only I had a little humility , " Turner once said , " I 'd be perfect . " <p> And now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed magazine covers in Turner 's penthouse office at CNN Center are years old , his hair no darker than a salt-and-pepper mix . They show a different man - the one who had to apologize for calling Christianity a religion " for losers . " The one who compared Rupert Murdoch to Hitler . <p> Today , Turner 's hair is white . And the man who vowed CNN would be on the air until the end of time talks in vague references to the end of his own . <p> " I 'm 62 years old , " he said flatly in a recent interview with The Associated Press . " I 'm closer to the end than the beginning . " <p> It is a strange sound - an admission of mortality from the man credited with changing television forever and helping make Atlanta the capital of the New South . <p> Along the way , Turner became a symbol of money and power . It was never clear which he wanted more . <p> That all changed in the mid-1990s , when Turner became a player in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piling up a $9.1 billion fortune while loosening his grip on his own kingdom - and watching his firecracker reputation slip away . <p> First he folded Turner Broadcasting System into giant Time Warner , accepting an unfamiliar No. 2 role and becoming the largest single shareholder of the world 's biggest media and entertainment company . <p> " When he merged with Time Warner , it was almost , I think , treated with a very subtle kind of disrespect , " said Reese Schonfeld , who helped Turner launch CNN in 1980 . " They honored most of his wishes and sneered at him behind his back . " <p> Then America Online swallowed Time Warner whole , and Turner became a vice chairman , an adviser , and - many would argue - a figurehead . He 's watched as the new corporation has divvied up his creation and fired some of his closest friends . <p> The AOL announcement came just days after Turner and actress Jane Fonda made their separation public , breaking up one of America 's best-known couples . <p> Schonfeld , who recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that has wasted away to failure , said Turner knew his life - business and personal - was changing in the late 1990s . <p> " Ted is a very smart man , " he said . " I feel certain that he knew what was going on and was happy enough to end this . I think he just started looking for other fields . " <p> He was a man with nothing to do - and billions of dollars to do it with . <p> Listening to words come out of Ted Turner 's mouth is like watching water come out of a kinked garden hose . The information trickles out in stops and starts , unpredictable . <p> Asked about his role in AOL Time Warner , he freezes and folds his arms across his tie , which features a blinding collaboration of foreign flags . " I 've talked enough about that , " he says sharply . He will not say even that much about the end of his marriage ; it is one of the ground rules for this interview that the subject not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money he is giving away - hundreds of millions of dollars he has donated over the past five years to a dizzying array of causes - and he gushes . <p> " I 'm concerned about everything on the planet , " he said . " The health of the human race . You have to have your heart , your brain , your lungs , your kidneys . You have to save everything in order to save anything . " <p> And the receipts say he is trying to do just that . <p> Turner gives about $50 million each year to the Turner Foundation , sending the money to causes ranging from promotion of population control to saving woodpeckers and black-footed ferrets . <p> He is spreading out a $1 billion donation to the United Nations in pieces , making sure it goes to four priorities - women and population , children 's health , the environment and security . Last year , he added a $34 million pledge to the U.N . to cover a reduced U.S. contribution to its budget in 2001 . <p> And he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microscopic range , like the $500 he gave to the volunteer fire department of Gordon , Neb. , which helped fight a blaze on his ranch there . <p> Most wealthy philanthropists have a handful of different interests , but Turner 's laundry list of causes is unusual , said Stacy Palmer , editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy . <p> " He gets wrapped up in a lot of passions , " she said . " And his philanthropy reflects that . " <p> For the moment , Turner 's biggest passion seems to be nuclear weapons . He raves about " Thirteen Days , " the Kevin Costner drama about the Cuban missile crisis , when the world paused on the brink of annihilation . <p> He is fond of the phrase " hair-trigger alert , " slang for nations ' capability to launch weapons of mass destruction with only precious minutes of warning . <p> " We assumed that the world would become safer when the Cold War was over , " he said . " The world basically moved on to other problems - the economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long that we just kind of got used to them . I figured we needed to get it back on the agenda . " <p> Turner committed $250 million over five years to reducing nuclear arsenals , joining former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn , who commended the mogul for committing his " energy , creativity and resources " to the problem . <p> " He has more time as he steps back from some of his business commitments , " Palmer said . " It 'll be interesting to see what his next phase is . " <p> Turner admits that he is only a small part of the AOL Time Warner giant , controlling 3 percent of the conglomerate . He talks about the 1980s and early 1990s , " when CNN reported to me . " <p> But control and competitiveness , two hallmarks of his reputation , remain key to his character . About the same time Turner focused his attention on giving away his fortune , he came up with an idea to encourage other billionaires to do the same . <p> Why not rank them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class is ranked by their success in business ? <p> " There was no similar way in which you were rewarded ( for giving ) , " Palmer said . " He started putting the word out to magazines . It 's clear that some of that competitive juice had been stirred up . " <p> He topped Fortune magazine 's list in 1998 , which counted his $1 billion gift to the U.N . And he chided Microsoft pioneer Bill Gates for not giving more : " What good is wealth sitting in the bank ? " <p> Gates and his wife led a list released last month by the Chronicle , giving $5 billion in 2000 . Turner ranked 14th . <p> " I started giving money because I had money , " he said . " If you 're a dancer , dance . If you 're a writer , write . If you 've got a lot of money , contribute . " <p> Peter Arnett , a Turner friend who reported from Baghdad during CNN 's Gulf War heyday but left the network after a reprimand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new role has left him much more time to devote to advancing causes . <p> " He 's sitting up there , but he 's not in the chain of command anymore , " Arnett said . <p> " When you look at the man , he 's done such a hell of a lot . Any one of those areas would make a great obituary item . And who knows what he 'll do in the future ? " <p> What , if anything at all ? Ted Turner , who built a reputation on restlessness , who for years seemed to fire off his mouth and his checkbook without warning , talks as though he is satisfied , finally , with what he has created . <p> Not that he shies from the notion of leaving a legacy . He makes no secret of wanting the money he has given away to ensure his influence decades from now , even as his corporate influence dwindles before his eyes . <p> " I 'm perfectly happy , " Turner said . " In the old westerns , the hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He grins . " And disappear . " <p> On the Net : <p> Turner Foundation : http : **26;5422;TOOLONG <p> U.N .
