<p> More than 40 million children participate in organized sports in the United States , a cultural phenomenon known as much for its excesses as its successes . <p> Tales of overburdened children playing sports out of season , of demands to specialize in a single sport as early as grade school , of competitive pressures that lead to national championships for 9-year-olds  --  even in something like power lifting  --  are so ingrained that they have bred a counterrevolution . <p> Increasingly , coaches and parents are doing something more than simply protesting the extremes or longing wistfully for days of sandlot pickup games . <p> In Montclair , N.J. , a group of parents fed up with clashing schedules every spring for traveling baseball and traveling soccer teams persuaded local baseball officials to sponsor a fall-only soccer team , so their children could play each sport at a high level at different times of the year . <p> At La Jolla Country Day School in San Diego , officials who were dismayed about pressures on athletes as young as 11 years old to specialize in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two sports . The school also designed an unusual dual-sport participation contract , which requires high school and travel team coaches to put in writing how they plan to resolve all scheduling conflicts to avoid overtaxing the athlete . <p> In Connecticut , the high school sports governing board prohibits athletes from playing on traveling club teams in the same season they play the sport in high school . Other states have enacted similar rules , sometimes leading to lawsuits challenging the rules . So far the high schools have prevailed , although many school officials fear this clash will ultimately be won by travel teams  --  when they replace high school sports altogether . <p> " The shame of it is you see how hardened these 14-year-olds are by the time they get to high school , " said Bruce Ward , director of physical education and athletics in San Diego 's public schools . " They 're talented , terrific players , but I do n't see the joy . They look tired . They 've played so much year-round , they are like little professionals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some critics are saying half in jest , if we planned to adopt the East German sports model ? <p> These are the tensions of the moment in youth sports , and the playing field battlegrounds are apparent in countless communities , most of them suburban , around the country . Contributing to the charged atmosphere are other voices , who are not apologizing for the new look of sports for America 's children . They are defending it . <p> These parents and coaches see the well-documented excesses of travel and club teams as aberrations the news media seize upon because they are compelling stories . The defenders point to many studies that characterize adolescents involved in athletics as less likely to drink , smoke or use drugs and more likely to be good students . They say the ultraorganized modern model of sports teams for children is simply a sign of changing times ; it is a valuable way , they say , to teach fundamental principles and competencies like teamwork , accountability , self-reliance and dealing with adversity . <p> Dave Dane is a longtime coach in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 4,000 children play ice hockey , baseball , basketball and soccer . <p> " There is this nostalgia over how we all used to play in the sandlot , " Dane said . " Well , it is n't 1953 anymore . Everything in life is a little more complicated , the numbers are far bigger and it takes some adult organizationto help the kids play . Yes , we 've all seen bad things happen : coaches or parents who have taken things too seriously and damaged their kids ' enjoyment of the game . <p> " But the vast majority of families grow positively from it . When was the last time you heard about a kid kicked off his travel team who turned around and murdered somebody in high school ? That was n't the story of Columbine . Those kids did n't do anything after school . " <p> The Stars of Massachusetts , an elite all-girl traveling soccer team of 13- and 14-year-olds , practices in Acton . At the end of a practice in September , team members discussed their harried schedules as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even three , club teams . <p> " It helps if you give up sleep , " Lydia Rodman , about to begin a 20-minute ride home to Newton , Mass. , said in the dim light of another full day not yet done . " You get more done that way . " <p> But Rodman and her teammates blanched at the suggestion that their extensive obligations to soccer could have unintended , detrimental consequences . <p> " You ca n't learn everything in school , " said Molly Blumberg , who is 13 and from Lexington , Mass . " I 've learned from getting involved out here . I 'm a stronger person . I 've learned social skills and self-esteem . I got that from this team . And it 's my choice . I had to convince my mom to do this . " <p> Critics , though , see youth sports as the product of ultracompetitive parents with unrealistic expectations who now have the time and financial wherewithal to administer and structure all so-called play . Even if it is a minority pushing too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . These parents feel pressure to buy into a system of year-round competition on travel teams , expensive private coaches and instruction at summer sports camps  --  a level of commitment routine at the upper echelons of youth competition these days . <p> To many people , this is yet another example of the modern American compulsion to overdo everything . It is a cross between a 1950 's **27;364;TOOLONG sensibility and a 1990 's chase for the very best of everything . <p> Breaking the Bonds of Soccer <p> Montclair is a hotbed of youth soccer , and the town 's soccer leaders wanted no part of a proposal for a fall-only travel team of 11-year-olds who preferred to play a different sport in the spring . They rejected the idea , keeping with the accepted notion in most locales that soccer at the travel level is a 10-month-a-year sport , played in the fall , winter and spring . <p> Some dissatisfied parents , in a novel bit of alternative thinking , turned to the Montclair Baseball Club for help . The parents hired their own professional soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league in northern New Jersey . Asked to list their official town soccer sponsor , the parent organizers wrote MBBC , for Montclair Baseball Club . <p> " As a family , we just wanted to stop changing uniforms in the car as we literally ran from one place to another every weekend , " said Joe Campeas , whose 11-year-old son , Sam , joined the soccer team under the auspices of the baseball club . " We wanted to play two sports in their seasons , and only in their seasons . " <p> Ashley Hammond is the president and co-owner of Montclair 's year-round indoor complex , the Soccer Domain , where he supervises 20 professional coaches . Of the fall-only soccer club for boys who want to play only baseball in the spring , he said : " They 're not wrong to try , but the mothers of those kids have told me they want their kids to play both sports in high school . The reality is you can not do that if you play soccer for just one season a year . Not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never accept that soccer is a year-round sport , but it is , whether they like it or not . " <p> An outgrowth of local recreational leagues , travel teams have become common wherever sports are played . These teams are like a collection of all-star players who journey to surrounding towns , or beyond , for competition . The next level is select or elite teams , which often represent a state or an entire region . In nearly all cases , the commitment level increases the farther one travels up the youth sports ladder . <p> Not surprisingly , year-round travel team schedules lead to conflict . Jerry Citro , the coach of a prominent 12-and-under travel baseball team in Montclair , has cut players from his team because they missed too many practices to attend spring soccer games or practices . <p> " That did n't sit too well with some soccer parents , but this is a team game and it 's unfair to the rest of the team if you do n't come to our baseball practices , " said Citro , who also coaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High School girls ' basketball team . " I do n't blindly accept some of these trends . The choice should be : what sport am I going to play this season ? " <p> Caught in the middle , at least last spring , were the players . <p> " I definitely felt under pressure , " said Avery Attinson , 11 , who is playing on the fall-only travel soccer team and hopes to play baseball for Citro in the spring . " You do n't want to let anyone down , and you do n't want to give up playing any of the sports . But there are conflicts , and you feel like you 're supposed to choose one . I 'm glad I do n't have to right now . " <p> But when Attinson and his soccer teammates were asked if they expected to have to specialize in one sport eventually , each 11-year-old agreed he would . Asked when , Attinson said by his freshman year in high school . <p> " No , by eighth grade , " responded his teammate Robert Chiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Younger <p> Nancy Lazenby Blaser was a newcomer in the town of Morgan Hill , Calif. , just south of San Jose , when she took her 5-year-old daughter , Alexandra , to the local playground . By happenstance , Alexandra became involved in an informal game of softball with a group of other kindergartners . <p> " One of the other mothers was watching Alexandra and said : ' Hey , she 's pretty good . What team does she play on ? ' " Lazenby Blaser said . " And I said : ' She does n't play on any team . She 's 5 years old . ' And the other mother looked at me with this serious expression and said , ' If she does n't start to play organized ball now , she wo n't be able to play in high school . ' <p> " And I laughed and said , ' Do you know what I do for a living ? ' " <p> Lazenby Blaser is the commissioner of athletics for the central-coast section of the California Interscholastic Federation . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is peer pressure , gets to most people , " she said . " You start second-guessing yourself , saying , ' Geez , am I selling my daughter short ? ' " <p> Lazenby Blaser 's initial visit to the playground was four years ago . Since then , she has had another disquieting thought . " My daughter is 9 , and you know what ? They may have been right about her , " she said . " I 'm afraid she may not be able to play in high school . Her skill level may be below those that have been playing year-round since they were really young . " <p> Four hundred miles to the south in the San Diego area , where favorable weather makes year-round play possible in any sport , there are more than 125 baseball teams for children 10 and under playing as many as 80 games a year . Some teams have two two-hour practices a week and play games on the weekends , which are also sometimes devoted to attending tournaments . <p> When Bill McClurg , the head coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mostly 9-year-olds  --  was asked to describe the length of his team 's season , he answered , " Labor Day to Labor Day . " <p> " The kids do it because they enjoy it , " McClurg said . " Maybe it 's not for everyone , but I see a lot of smiling faces . And there is no doubt their skills improve from all the training and game situations . " <p> But across town at the private La Jolla Country Day School , the sports counterreformation is in full swing . Some of the students are top college recruits , but school officials still require every athlete to try at least two sports as a freshman or sophomore . <p> " I do n't want some 14-year-old walking through the door telling me he does n't have time for other sports because he 's a soccer player , " Jeff Hutzler , La Jolla Country Day 's athletic director , said . " How does he know ? " <p> At the same time , the school tries to prevent athletes from practicing for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club team in the same season . School officials created a dual-sport participation contract after Candice Wiggins , a student who is among the top three female high school basketball recruits in the nation , tore knee ligaments last year at a club volleyball practice she attended one evening after practicing with the high school basketball team in the afternoon . <p> " Unbeknownst to us , Candice was practicing three hours a day with her volleyball team after practicing two hours with us on the basketball court , " Hutzler said . " That same year , we had a cross-country runner pass out facedown at the finish line of a state championship race . We found out she had played in a club soccer game that morning . " <p> High School Athletics Affected <p> High school teams may have the most to lose from the explosion of travel and elite teams , many school athletic officials say . While youth sports were originally intended to be feeder programs for high schools , they could end up devouring the sports programs they were created to serve . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Kanaby , executive director of the National Federation of State High School Associations , " as we continue to cut educational budgets , it is inevitable that some school official will say : ' We 've already got these clubs running the sports in town ; why not let them take over our teams ? We can save on equipment , coaching salaries and insurance . We can even make money renting the high school gyms and fields to them . ' <p> " It has already been discussed in places . That is the Euro-Asian model . Local clubs run the sports in town for high school-age athletes . " <p> Travel teams have many enticements for young athletes . They play in regional tournaments that routinely attract college recruiters , who know they can see the best players from several states in one setting . <p> But the club model is highly controversial for a variety of reasons , most notably for a lack of academic or behavioral standards , or precautionary safety regulations . <p> " Unless you 're in jail that night , you can play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Florida athletic directors ' association , said . " It does n't matter if you are failing every subject in school . And if you want to pitch 100 innings in a three-week period because you 've got three big tournaments in a row ? Go ahead . Who is going to stop you ? " <p> Since club teams are expensive , the possibility that they will replace high school teams may also establish a hefty pay-for-play agenda and highlight an existing financial reality : most travel teams outspend high school programs . <p> " By the time these kids get to high school , their club teams have flown them all over the world , " Paul Maskery , a coach or athletic director for 37 years who now presides over the Connecticut athletic administrators ' organization . " They 've played with new uniforms every year . We ca n't compete with that . At the high school , we hand them a four-year-old uniform and put them on a bumpy yellow school bus for the next game . We have a lot to offer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Some coaches and administrators are convinced that , for now , the popularity of high school football is saving high school athletics . <p> " A lot of the top kids in other sports already do n't bother with their high school team , " Rick Francis , president of the California Athletic Directors Association , said . " We had two girls who were future Division I college basketball players who did n't even talk to their high school coaches . If football were a club sport , linked to a big national association for teenage players like the other sports , we 'd be in big trouble . " <p> The Culture of Competition <p> To many people , the intensity of travel and club teams represents nothing more than Americans doing what Americans tend to do instinctively : compete zealously . <p> " We want our kids to go to the best preschool , even the best pre-preschool , " Kanaby said . " We want them to be the best reader in pre-preschool . We 're bringing the same attitude to youth sports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sees no turning back . <p> " It is too embedded in what is a highly competitive culture , " he said . " The baby boomer parents generally have been very motivated , very successful people in life , and they transfer all that to their kids . People talk about youth sports and say , ' This is only for fun . ' If you talk to parents , they might say that , but they do n't mean it . They want their kid to get ahead . <p> " It 's the same as a parent of a talented piano-playing child . They want their child to practice the piano every day to reach the elite level . It 's the way Americans are and you 're not going to stop it . " <p> Fred Engh , the most veteran voice in the booming chorus of critics , disagrees . In 1981 he created the National Alliance for Youth Sports , a nonprofit organization that touts a training and education program aimed at reclaiming sports for boys and girls . <p> " I believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing the other way , " Engh said . <p> Yet many of those most actively involved tend to reject the calls for change . They insist that a new model for children 's sports has been created , one that filled a cultural gap left by suburban sprawl . And they say that , by and large , the model serves the country 's youngsters well . <p> " What is the alternative ? " Dave Scheuer , executive director of Acton-Boxboro Youth Soccer , said . " Do we abolish all the teams , remove all the competition ? I do n't think that would make the kids happy . Many would be devastated . We have something our kids are engaged in and feel passionate about . Kept in balance , it is good for their bodies and minds . Why would you want to steer them to something else ? " <p> Behind Scheuer , cavorting across five practice fields , were hundreds of boys and girls , ages 5 to 14 . After 90 minutes , like a shift change at a factory , one mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second gaggle sprinting to the fields in shorts , spikes and T-shirts . <p> " I see the excesses and they concern me , " Scheuer said . " But I see the benefits . Do you eliminate one to eliminate the other ? " <p> Across town an hour later , the last members of the Stars of Massachusetts were sifting through the darkness , heading toward a convoy of parents in S.U.V. 's and minivans . <p> " This is n't for everyone , " Lydia Rodman , 13 , said . " It does get pretty hectic . But this is still the best part of my day . " <p> Anna Konopacz , a 13-year-old teammate of Rodman 's from Sudbury , Mass. , nodded in agreement . " I took a break and gave this up for two years , " Konopacz said . " I missed it . I wanted to come back . I figure I can relax when I get older . " <p> She smiled and added , " You 're only young once . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
