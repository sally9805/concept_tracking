A bloodred cardinal sparkled against the snow-covered ground . He 'd dropped from his perch to snatch a few bits of millet still visible by the red chokeberry shrubs scattered at the edge of the field . The snow base , six inches , obscured most of the seeds that the flaming bird liked to eat , but light winds kept a few delicacies dropping , including some still-succulent chokeberry seeds . Low gunmetal gray clouds , dense as fog in some spots , hung over the fresh white snow . In the center of this lovely thirty-acre hayfield on Orchard Hill Farm stood a lone sentinel , a 130-foot sugar maple . Surrounding the hayfield were forests of hardwoods and pine . Two whitetail deer bolted over the three-board fence . Deer season ran from mid-November to January 2 in this part of Virginia . Those benighted humans who had yet to reach their legal bag limit might be found squatting in the snow on this December 27 , a cold Saturday . Bolting across the field in the direction opposite the deer came two sleek foxhounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate , did not notice the hounds . The millet was too tasty . But when the birds heard the ruckus , they raised their crests and fluttered up to the oak branches as the hounds sped by . Before the birds could drop back to their feast , four more hounds raced past , snow whirling up behind their paws like iridescent confetti . In the distance , a hunting horn blew three long blasts , the signal for hounds to return . Jane Arnold , Master of Foxhounds for the Jefferson Hunt Club , checked her advance just inside the forest at the westernmost border of the hayfield . The snowfall increased , huge flakessticking to the horse 's coat for a moment , to her eyelashes . She felt the cool , moist pat of flakes on her red cheeks . As she exhaled , a stream of breath also came from her mount , a lovely bold thoroughbred , Rickyroo . Behind her , steam rising from their mounts ' hindquarters and flanks , were fifty-four riders . Ahead was the huntsman , Shaker Crown , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting horn to his lips . The bulk of the pack , twenty couplehounds are always counted in twos or couplesobediently awaited their next order . Sister cast her bright eyes over the treetops . Chickadees , wrens , and one woodpecker peered down at her . No foxes had just charged through here . Different birds had different responses to a predator like a fox . These creatures would have been disturbed , moved about . Crows , ravens , and starlings , on the other hand , would have lifted up in a flock and screamed bloody murder . They loathed being disturbed and despised foxes to the marrow of their light bones . On Sister 's left , a lone figure remained poised at the fence line . If Shaker moved forward , then the whipper-in , Betty Franklin , would take the old tiger trap jump and keep well to the left . Betty , a wise hunter , knew not to press on too far ahead . The splinter of the pack , which had broken now , veered to the right , and the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away across the hayfield . Whether Sybil could turn the three couple of hounds troubled Sister . A pack should stay togethereasier said than done . Sister blamed herself for this incident . It takes years and years , decades really , to build a level pack of hounds . She had included too many first-year entrythe hound equivalent of a first graderin to- day 's hunt . First-year entry sat in the kennels for Christmas Hunt , which had been last Saturday . Christmas Hunt , the third of the High Holy Days of hunting , overflows with people and excitement . Both she and her huntsman , whom Sister adored , felt the Christmas Hunt would have been too much for the youngsters . Today she should have taken only one couple , not the four included in this pack . Shaker had mentioned this to her , but she had waved him off , saying that the field would n't be that large today , as many riders would still be recuperating from the rigors of Christmas . There had been over one hundred people for Christmas Hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good number of folks . The hounds loved hunting in the snow . For the young entry this was their first big snow , and they just could n't contain themselves . She sat on Rickyroo who sensed her irritation . Sister felt a perfect ass . She 'd hunted all her life , and , at seventy-two , it was a full life . How could she now be so damned stupid ? Luckily , most people behind her knew little about the art of foxhunting , and it was an art not a science . They loved the pageantry , the danger , the running and jumping , its music . A few even loved the hounds themselves . Out of that field of fifty-four people , perhaps eight or nine really understood foxhunting . And that was fine by Sister . As long as people respected nature , pro- tected the environment , and paid homage to the foxa genius wrapped in furshe was happy . Foxhunting was like baseball : a person need n't know the difference between a sinker and a slider when it crossed home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as people knew the basics and behaved themselves on horseback , she was pleased . She knew better than to expect anyone to behave when off a horse . She observed Shaker . Every sense that man possessed was working overtime , as were hers . She drew in a cold draught of air , hoping for a hint of information . She listened intently and could hear , a third of a mile off , the three couple of hounds speaking for all they were worth . Perhaps they hit a fresh line of scent . In this snow , the scent would have to be fresh , just laid from the fox 's paws . The rest of the pack watched Shaker . If scent were burning , surely Cora or Diana , Dasher or Ardent would have told them . But then the youngsters had broken off back in the woods . Had the pack missed the line ? With an anchor hound like the four-year-old Diana , now in her third season , this was unlikely . Young though she was , this particular hound was following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hounds Sister had ever known , Archie , gone to his reward and remembered with love every single day . Odd how talent appears in certain hounds , horses , and humans . Diana definitely had it . She now faced the sound of the splinter group , stern level , head lifted , nose in the air . Something was up . Behind Sister , Dr. Walter Lungrun gratefully caught his breath . The run up to this point had been longer than he realized , and he needed a break . Wealthy Crawford Howard , convivial as well as scheming , passed his flask around . It was accepted with broad smiles from friend and foe alike . Crawford subscribed to the policy that a man should keep his friends close and his enemies closer still . His wife , Marty , an attractive and intelligent woman , also passed around her flask . Crawford 's potion was a mixture of blended scotch , Cointreau , a dash of bitters , with a few drops of fresh lemon juice . Liberally consumed , it hit like a sledgehammer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foxhunters , both in their seventh decade , listened keenly . Their daughter , Sybil , in her midforties , was the second whipper-in . She had her work cut out for her . They knew she was a bold rider , so they had no worries there . But Sybil , in her second year as an honorary whipper-in ( as opposed to a professional ) fretted over every mistake . Sybil 's parents and two sons would buoy her up after each hunt since she was terribly hard on herself . Betty Franklin loved whipping-in , but she knew there were moments when Great God Almighty could n't control a hound with a notion . She was considerably more relaxed about her duties than Sybil . Also passing around handblown glass flasks , silver caps engraved with their initials , were Henry Xavier ( called Xavier or X ) , Clay Berry , and Ronnie Haslipmen in their middle forties . These high-spirited fellows had been childhood friends of Ray Arnold Jr . Sister 's son , born in 1960 , had been killed in 1974 in a harvesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musketeers . Sister had watched her son 's best friends grow up , graduate from college . Two had married , all succeeded in business . They were very dear to her . After about five minutes , Shaker tapped his hat with his horn , leaned down , and spoke encouragingly to Cora , his strike hound . She rose up on her hind legs to get closer to this man she worshipped . Then he said , " Come long , " and his pack obediently followed as he rode out of the forest , taking the second tiger trap jump as Betty Franklin took the first . If the pack and the huntsman were a clock , the strike hound being at twelve , Betty stayed at ten o'clock , Sybil at two , the huntsman at six . Sister , thirty yards behind Shaker , sailed over the tiger trap . Most of the other riders easily followed , but a few horses balked at the sight of the upright logs , leaning together just like a trap . The snow did n't help the nervous ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared new and different . As riders passed the sugar maple , Cora began waving her stern . The other hounds became interested . Dragon , a hotheaded but talented third-year hound and the brother to Diana , bellowed , " It 's her ! It 's her ! " The thick odor of a vixen lifted off the snow . Cora , older , and steady even though she was the strike hound , paused a moment . " Yes , it is a vixen , but something 's not quite right . " Diana , her older brother , Dasher , and Asa and Ardent also paused . At nine , the oldest hound in the pack , Delia , mother of the D litters , usually brought up the rear . While her youthful speed had diminished , her knowledge was invaluable . Delia , too , put her nose to the snow . The other hounds looked at her , even her brash son , Dragon . " It 's a vixen all right , but it is extremely peculiar , " Delia advised . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . " Our job is to chase foxes , and it does n't matter if they 're peculiar or not . I say we give this field another run for their money . " Cora lifted her head to again look at Shaker . " Well , it is a vixen and whatever is wrong with line , I guess we 'll find out . " With the hounds opening , their vibrant voices filled the air with a music as lush to the ear of a foxhunter as the Brandenburg Concertos are to a musician . No matter how many times she heard her pack in full cry , it always made the hair stand up on the back of Sister 's neck . They glided across the hayfield , soared over the stone jumps on the other side , plunged into the woods as they headed for a deep creek that fed the apple orchards for which Orchard Hill was known . The cardinal once again left off the millet and flew back up into the oak tree . " Bother , " he grumbled to his mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his shrewd helpmate answered . The hounds , running close together , passed under the oak , followed by Shaker , then Sister and the field . They ran flat out for twenty minutes , everyone sweating despite the cold . The baying of the pack now joined the baying of the splinter group .
