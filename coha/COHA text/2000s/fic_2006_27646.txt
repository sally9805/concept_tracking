Soul Kitchen By Poppy Z. Brite Random House Poppy Z. Brite 1 Mardi Gras morning dawned dank and cold . The four cooks had already been at the restaurant for a couple of hours , preparing a krewe breakfast for Rickey 's mother 's truck parade . Truck parades are a Carnival Day phenomenon unknown outside New Orleans . Rather than the ornate and glamorous confections boasted by the bigger , richer krewes , their floats are basically giant wooden boxes pulled by tractor-trailer cabs that blast their air horns incessantly as they roll through the streets . Each float 's riders select a theme-Louisiana Sports Legends , say , or Favorite Desserts-and decorate their trailer in foil and crepe paper to reflect it . If they are feeling flush , they might invest in theme sweatshirts too , but many of the beads , cups , and trinkets they throw are caught from other parades earlier in the season or even the previous Mardi Gras . Truck parades are a part of blue-collar Carnival seldom seen by the tourists who frequent Bourbon Street , but a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gary " G-man " Stubbs were not a part of that segment , at least not today . Because they owned a popular restaurant , Rickey 's mother had convinced them to put on a breakfast buffet for the Krewe of Chalmatians , so named because most of its members were from NewOrleans ' Lower Ninth Ward or the neighboring suburb of Chalmette . Rickey and G-man had grown up in the Lower Ninth Ward , but moved away when they turned eighteen , a little over a decade ago . The only vestiges of downtown that remained were their gritty Brooklynesque accents and a certain reluctance to take any shit off of anyone , be it a lazy line cook , a purveyor delivering inferior produce , or a diner with an unjustified complaint about his meal . Having cooked together for fifteen years and lived together for the better part of that time , Rickey and G-man knew each other 's kitchen habits by heart and worked together as efficiently as two hands washing one another . To fill out their crew this morning they had recruited Tanker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Marquis , who was young but learning fast . He 'd started out as a salad bitch , but now they let him work the hot line on slow nights . Today he would be in charge of keeping bacon , sausage , and toast coming out of the oven , topping up the water in the rented steam tables , and cutting celery for the Bloody Marys . Tanker had reheated the big pot of crawfish etouffee they 'd made last night and was now working on a giant batch of grits . G-man , Rickey 's co-chef and the true workhorse of the kitchen , was adding clarified butter to egg yolks in a double boiler to make hollandaise sauce for Rickey 's eggs Sardou . Tall and rangy , with short dark hair tucked under a purple New Orleans Hornets baseball cap , G-man scowled at the sauce through the dark glasses he habitually wore in any bright light . He had tried to talk Rickey out of this fussy and time-consuming dish , but Rickey had insisted on it . The restaurant 's name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained some form of booze , a perfect concept for New Orleans . Of course they were n't sticking to the gimmick for this breakfast , but Rickey felt that at least one dish should pack an alcoholic punch , so eggs Sardou it was : poached eggs with artichoke hearts , hollandaise , and an Herbsaint-laced spinach cream . " Splooge , " Rickey muttered as he tasted the spinach . Not as tall as G-man and a little paunchy from a lifetime of sampling his own dishes , he was handsome enough to have been anointed a glamour boy by the national food press , but his features were sharpened by a nervous tension that seldom left him even when he was drunk or sleeping . " Baby food . All this fucking shit is baby food . It 's giving me flashbacks to when I had to work hotel brunch . " " So why 'd you sign up ? " said Tanker . " More to the point , why 'd you sign us up ? Nobody said you had to make breakfast for three hundred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they got like three hundred people in the krewe , but not all of them are gon na show up . " " You hope , " G-man said . " My mom made a signup sheet , OK ? We got one-eighty coming in . We scoop it and poop it , they eat it , everybody 's happy . " " Yeah , but why 'd you agree to it in the first place ? " Tanker persisted . " I mean , you 're a prima donna , Rickey . You hate this kinda shit . " " I know it . " Rickey pushed the blue bandanna up on his forehead and thumbed a stray drop of sweat out of his left eye . " But it 's my mom , dude . She never asks me for anything . " " Except a couple grandbabies , " G-man said . Rickey 's mother had been doing her best to ignore G-man 's role in her son 's life for years now . " Yeah , well , you know she 's never getting ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , these clowns are paying pretty good . " " I think my momma wishes she 'd quit getting grandbabies , " said Marquis . " My sister , she just done had her fifth . " " Jesus . " " And the daddy do n't help her out nohow . " " Same one for all five kids ? " Tanker asked . Marquis glanced up at him , seemed to measure whether such a fatuous white-boy question deserved any response at all , said , " Nah , dawg , " and went back to laying out strips of bacon on a sheet pan . G-man , the youngest of six children from an Irish-Italian family , silently counted himself lucky that his parents already had an even dozen grandchildren . Otherwise , his mother probably would have been pushing him and Rickey to get a kid from somewhere or other despite her strict Catholic beliefs . Of course , owning a restaurant was a lot like having a five-hundred-pound baby that never grew up . Originally financed by local celebrity chef , multimillionaire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own steam now , and they hoped to buy Lenny out with some money Rickey had inherited under strange circumstances the year before . Most of the inheritance was tied up in a piece of Texas property , however , and Lenny still owned twenty-five percent of Liquor . Fortunately , he was busy with his own two successful restaurants and mostly left Liquor alone . Rickey put the spinach cream in the lowboy refrigerator at his station and headed back to the walk-in cooler to get a case of eggs . The other cooks had begged him to use a powdered mix for the scrambled eggs-it would have made his life far easier this morning , and if Rickey 's life was easier , theirs were too-but such a shortcut simply was n't in his nature . He might be a bit of a whore , he supposed , but he was no shoemaker . He would scramble the eggs slowly and gently in a double boiler , adding a knob of butter now and then , until they took on the perfect creaminess that was the only acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the Chalmatians just shoveled the eggs into their hungry maws , too drunk to notice the difference , he would still have the satisfaction of knowing he had done them right . That satisfaction was one of the major things he lived for . In the three years since it opened , Liquor had become not just a popular restaurant but a trendy one . Between Lenny 's machinations , food-press enthusiasm , a prestigious James Beard award , and a couple of healthy doses of controversy , it was now one of the best-known new restaurants in New Orleans . ( In a city where several eateries had been in business for a century or more , it would remain a " new restaurant " for at least a dozen more years . ) Rickey had very mixed feelings about this trendiness . Because of it , and because of what Food &; Wine had once cringe-inducingly called " his dissipated-fratboy good looks , " he had been subjected to all manner of hype that had nothing to do with the backbreaking day-to-day business of running a world-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his little ways of reacting against the hype . Most hot chefs would probably turn up their coke-encrusted noses at the idea of cooking splooge for a hundred and eighty working-class yats . Rickey still considered himself one of those yats , and while he was n't exactly proud of the food itself , he liked how aggressively declasse such a breakfast was . Lost in his thoughts , he nearly tripped over some large object that had been left on the floor of the walk-in . Peering down in the dim light , he saw that it was a burlap sack of oysters . At the krewe 's request , they 'd set up a makeshift oyster bar in the dining room for those perverts who considered a dozen icy-cold raw mollusks dipped in ketchup , horseradish , and Tabasco part of a nutritious breakfast . ( Rickey liked oysters on the half shell just fine , but not at seven o'clock in the morning . ) Marquis was supposed to have lugged the oysters up front and dumped them on ice to await the shucker 's arrival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , then decided not to . Marquis was getting to be a decent cook , but he was easily distracted . If he left his station now , he 'd probably burn the bacon or worse . Instead Rickey bent to hoist the fifty-pound sack onto his shoulder . As soon as it came off the floor , he knew he 'd lifted it badly , and an instant later he felt something give deep in the small of his back . " Owwwwwwfuck ! " he yelled . His hands instinctively wanted to go to the injury , but he knew if he dropped the oyster sack now , he would n't be able to lift it again . Instead he got it the rest of the way up and stood holding his breath , waiting to see how bad the pain was going to get . It flared , twisted through his spine like a hot wire , then settled down with the air of a visitor that had found a comfortable spot and was planning to stay a while . While Liquor was something of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that of most hot spots : no dangerous-looking metal sculptures , lipstick-red walls , glass floors with saltwater lagoons underneath , giant paintings of fruits and vegetables , or Arabian fantasies . Rickey , who micromanaged every aspect of the restaurant , had been far more influenced by the look of New Orleans ' old-line joints , and so the dining room was a dark green , softly lit , clubby space accented with rich wood trim and small mirrors . On a typical night , the dining room was full of men in suits or sports shirts , women in cocktail dresses , the clink of cutlery on plates and ice cubes in glasses , the aromas of fine food and fresh bread . This morning , it was packed with people in pink sweatshirts bearing the legend krewe of chalmatians and the krewe 's logo , a spotted cartoon dog with a bouffant hairdo . The dog was supposed to be a Dalmatian , a pun on the krewe 's name , but looked rather more like a Chihuahua with chickenpox . Most of the women had hairdos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were balding . At 6:45 a.m. , the krewe members were already well-lubricated , happy , and yakking up a storm . " Raymond ! Hey , Raymond ! I hope you do n't getcha hand stuck in there again- " " Aw , Marie , hush up about dat . " " How you makin , dawl ? I ai n't seen you since Friday , maybe Saddy- " " Bud-DY ! Where y'at ? " " We got ta good team ! Dis is gon na be da year ! " At the bar , Mo-Tanker 's girlfriend and Liquor 's head mixologist-dispensed mimosas and poured Bloody Marys and screwdrivers from huge pitchers she had mixed early that morning . The waiters circulated , clearing dirty plates and topping up the buffet . The shucker , who had finally received the contents of the fateful burlap sack , slid his short flat blade between shells , severed connective muscles , nestled oysters by the dozen into platters of crushed ice . At the center of the hubbub was Rickey 's mother , Brenda Crabtree ( she had retaken her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resplendent in a fresh Copper Penny dye job and cat's-eye glasses with a dusting of tiny rhinestones at the corners . At her side was her gentleman friend , Mr. Claude , listening meekly as was his habit in life . " This is my son 's place ! " she told anyone who would listen . " My boy , he 's a famous chef ! He got him a write-up in Bone Ape Tit Magazine ! " Back in the kitchen , the famous chef winced as he bent to retrieve more eggs . A small hiss of pain escaped him . G-man , who was now cooking French toast , heard it even over the sizzle and bang of the kitchen . " Dude , what 's wrong with you ? " he called . " You been gimping around all morning . " " Nothing , " Rickey said . " Just twisted my back a little . I 'm fine . " In fact , the pain had increased so much that he felt a little nauseated . He was n't about to say anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the shift was over , but cooks in the kitchen did n't cry about their injuries . Burned yourself ? Consider the weal a badge of honor , like the tattoos most of them had . Sliced your finger open ? Slap on a bandage or some duct tape , maybe Superglue it if it 's really bad , and get back to work . Most of them had cut off at least one fingertip during the course of their careers , and all had ladders of burn scars on their forearms , hot-fat spatters on the backs of their hands , and feet that looked as if somebody had worked them over with a hammer . It was a painful line of work , but in the hyper-macho pirate crew atmosphere of the typical restaurant kitchen , complainers were apt to be mocked without mercy or hounded right out of a job . G-man looked searchingly at Rickey over the tops of his shades , but said nothing ; to challenge Rickey on this point in front of their crew would seriously violate the rough etiquette of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we only got a couple more hours . The Chalmatians got ta stage way the hell down on St. Claude , so they 'll all be out of here by eight-thirty . We can break it down and get gone by nine . " " Y'all gon na watch the parade ? " said Tanker . " Aw , I do n't know . My mom wants us to , " ( G-man rolled his eyes at that us ) " but there 's gon na be all that Zulu traffic . " " Just go on down Broad Street , " said Marquis . " You can cut over to St. Claude after Jackson . Zulu do n't go no farther than that . " " I know , I know . Continues ...
