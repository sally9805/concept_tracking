<p> When the first hint of sunlight breaks through the darkness of Sunday morning , pajama-clad youngsters , their parents and their dogs will watch from the shore of Norris Lake near Snellville . <p> In Buford , a priest at the Episcopal Church of St. Mary &; St. Martha of Bethany will work with flint to ignite a fire that will feed candles for a dawn worship service . <p> Thousands will climb Stone Mountain to continue a 57-year sunrise service tradition . <p> And Vicki Davis will shepherd 25 teens in preparing 40 pounds of pancake mix and 60 pounds of sausage for a breakfast at Christ the Lord Lutheran Church in Lawrenceville . <p> Sunday is Easter , and throughout the Gwinnett area , Christians will gather to observe the holiday and traditions with music , family , worship , fun and fellowship . <p> The day 's activities will wrap up a flurry of activity during Holy Week  --  and before  --  with congregations not only attending special services and programs but also spending time and energy preparing for the events . <p> Choirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of egg hunts have sought donations of Easter eggs and candy , Easter baskets have been filled for those in need , and churches have been dressed and redressed for the season . <p> At Presbyterian Church of the Redeemer in Snellville , preschool director Jeanne Jones is expecting a crowd of about 400 at today 's community Easter egg hunt . For a month and a half , the church has collected plastic Easter eggs and the candy to fill them . Community and church groups have helped stuff the estimated 4,000 eggs . And volunteers have spent another five hours sorting the eggs for different age groups and hiding them . <p> This is the second year the church has sponsored the event , which organizers say is a more subtle way to reach children and families in the community . <p> The breakfast prepared by the youths at Christ the Lord Lutheran Church on Easter morning is an annual tradition , said Davis , director of youth ministries . Following a substantial grocery shopping excursion on Friday , the group will be up and cooking at 7 a.m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the function . <p> The Altar Guild at the Episcopal Church of St. Mary &; St. Martha of Bethany meets today for a service , breakfast and continuation of a busy week of work . Members will be polishing silver and brass , ironing linens , putting flowers at all the windows and the baptismal font , hanging fresh floral wreaths and setting up for Easter services . They also will take down all the black draperies and dressings in the church that were used for Good Friday , exchanging them for the white used at Easter , said Martha Anne Ansari , head of the guild . <p> The changing of the draperies is a frequent task during Holy Week . While purple symbolizes Lent , red is used on Palm Sunday , then changed to white for the Last Supper and foot washing services on Thursday . Black is used on Good Friday to symbolize Jesus ' death and then everything is changed back to white for Easter , symbolizing the resurrection . <p> St. Mary &; St. Martha , like other churches in the Gwinnett area , holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , the congregation puts nails into the cross . On Easter , the nails are removed and the children of the church replace them with cut flowers , Ansari said . <p> The big public event for Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church in Norcross occurred Thursday as the church presented " Holy Thursday " to an audience of at least 3,000 . This is the fourth year Hopewell has performed the dramatic event , which involves more than 100 cast members plus technical support . <p> Each year , the church has added a new scene to the drama , which this year told the story of Jesus ' triumphant entry into Jerusalem , The Last Supper , his walk to Calvary , the Crucifixion and his Resurrection . Many members of the audience , as well as the cast , dress in biblical costume . <p> Preparations over the years have included the building of a tomb in 2000 , a task that turned out to be more daunting than expected , said Sandra Williams , who directs publishing and public relations for the church . <p> " It turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> The church wanted to dig the tomb out in a hill on the property , but the hill turned out to be a huge rock , she said , and blasting was required . <p> The service is an emotional one , particularly the Crucifixion scene , and particularly for children , Williams said . <p> It is so realistic , the children often cry , so the Rev. William Sheals , who portrays Jesus , comes out to the crowd after the Resurrection to comfort them , she said . <p> " He tells them , ' I am here , and Jesus is here , ' " Williams said . " It 's a good learning experience . It impacts them so . " <p> Among the many area events planned for Sunday morning are sunrise services  --  at churches , in cemeteries , in prayer gardens , at Norris and Lanier lakes , and atop Stone Mountain . <p> The Rev. Susan Triplitt of Norris Lake Presbyterian Church said the early morning gathering is traditionally a casual event , with children coming in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn chairs on the lake 's beach and sing their favorite hymns , accompanied by a keyboard . <p> The wooden cross for the Stone Mountain service is being erected today on top of the mountain and will be held in place by a wooden platform covered with rocks , said Jeanine Battle , special events manager for the park . <p> The Stone Mountain service , organized by the Stone Mountain Ministerial Alliance , continues a tradition begun 57 years ago by the late Lucile Lanford , a member of Stone Mountain First United Methodist Church . Lanford took youth groups up the mountain for an Easter service , a practice that has grown into an organized event with two simultaneous services  --  one on top of the mountain and one below on the laser lawn . <p> About 4,000 to 6,000 people attend the event every year , many climbing the mountain before sunrise to attend the service on top at 6:30 a.m . The park gates open at 4:30 a.m. , and admission is $7 per car . The skylift will be operating for those who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a round-trip fare is $5 for adults and $4 for children . <p> Speakers this year will be the Rev. Jonathan Holston , the district superintendent of the Atlanta-Decatur-Oxford District of the United Methodist church , and the Rev. Davidson Philips , former pastor of Decatur Presbyterian Church and retired president of Columbia Theological Seminary in DeKalb County . Holston will lead the service on top of the mountain , and Philips will speak at the service below . <p> Preparation for the Stone Mountain event begins every January as the ministerial alliance starts meeting with the park and arranging speakers for the services . <p> " We try to make it a nondenominational service , and we try to find people who are close enough to lead the service and then be able to make it back to their own church , " said Linda Hokit of the alliance . Hokit said she has received phone calls from out of town people planning to travel here , spend the night and attend the service at the mountain . <p> " This is something people have begun to make part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the longevity of the event reflects its importance to people . <p> Although the event is organized by the alliance , the duty of overseeing it rotates to various pastors within that organization . <p> The Rev. Tyler Downing , former pastor of Presbyterian Church in Stone Mountain , supervised the event last year , but this year offered to repeat the duty as part of his work on his doctorate . <p> Despite the longevity of the project , its planning has never been put into a manual form , said Downing , who said the organizers often have to " re-create the wheel " every year . As a project for his doctoral studies , Downing is creating a textbook of sorts that gives step-by-step instructions that future organizers can use in planning the event . The 40-page , loose-leaf manual will cover everything from Farmer 's Almanac sunrise times to how to put the bulletin together , he said . It will also cover the necessary but less pleasant concerns that go along with any large public event  --  concerns about the safety and health of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downing also preached atop the mountain in an Easter service five years ago . <p> " I was awed by the whole experience , " he said . <p> The darkness of the morning and the lights on the speaker required that he concentrate fully on his message , he said . But , he said , the feeling of Christians , regardless of denomination , meeting on top of a huge rock to celebrate Easter was one he will never forget . <p> " Coming down from the top of that mountain , I felt like a new person , " Downing said . " I felt like I really had been somewhere . I was charged up , and I can still feel it . " <p> Downing , who will move from Georgia to lead a church in Lynchburg , Va. , after he finishes his doctorate , said Stone Mountain has made an impression that will last . <p> " I will always have it in my heart . I 'll never forget that . " Senior Pastor William L.
