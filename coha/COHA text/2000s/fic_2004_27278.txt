Stanley , Flat Again ! Chapter One A Morning Surprise Mrs. Lambchop was making breakfast . Mr. Lambchop , at the kitchen table , helped by reading bits from the morning paper . " Here 's an odd one , Harriet , " he said . " There 's a chicken in Sweden that rides a bike . " " So do I George , " said Mrs. Lambchop , not really listening . " Listen to this . ' Merker Building emptied . To be collapsed next week . ' Imagine ! Eight floors ! " " Poor thing ! " Mrs. Lambchop set out plates . " Boys ! " she called . " Breakfast is ready ! " Her glance fell upon a row of photographs on the wall above the sink . There was a smiling Stanley , only half an inch thick , his big bulletin board having fallen from the bedroom wall to rest upon him overnight . Next came reminders of the many family adventures that had come after Stanley 's younger brother , Arthur , had cleverly blown him round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Prince Haraz , the young genie who had granted wishes for them all after being accidentally summoned by Stanley from a lamp . There was the entire family with Santa Claus and his daughter , Sarah , taken during a Christmas visit to the North Pole . There was the family again in Washington , D.C. , in the office of the President of the United States , who had asked them to undertake a secret mission into outer space . The last picture showed Arthur standing beside a balloon on which Mrs. Lambchop had painted a picture of Stanley 's face . The balloon , its string in fact held by Stanley , had been a valuable guide to his presence , since he was invisible at the time . " Boys ! " she called again . " Breakfast ! " In their bedroom , Stanley and Arthur had finished dressing . While Stanley filled his backpack , Arthur bounced a tennis ball . " Let 's go , " he said . " Here ! Catch ! " Stanley had just reached for a book on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he turned , and he banged his shoulder on a corner of the shelf . " Ouch ! " " Sorry , " Arthur said . " But let 's go , okay ? You know how long  --  STANLEY ! " " Why are you shouting ? " Stanley adjusted his pack . " C'm on ! I 'm so hungry  --  " He paused . " Oh , boy ! Arthur , do you see ? " " I do , actually . " Arthur swallowed hard . " You 're , you know ... Flat . " The brothers stared at each other . " The pump ? " Stanley said . " It might work again . " Arthur fetched the bicycle pump from their toy chest , and Stanley lay on his bed with the hose end in his mouth . Arthur gave a long , steady , pump . Stanley made a face . " That hurts ! " Arthur pumped again , and Stanley snatched the hose from his mouth . " Owww ! That really hurts ! It was n't like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " Arthur said . " We ca n't just hide in here forever , you know . " Mrs. Lambchop 's call came again . " Boys ! Please come ! " " Do me a favor , " Stanley said . " You tell them . Sort of get them ready . okay ? " " Okay , " said Arthur , and went to tell . Arthur stood in the kitchen doorway . " Hey , guess what ? " he said . " Hay is for horses , dear , " said Mrs. Lambchop . " Good morning ! Breakfast is ready . " " Good morning , Arthur , " Mr. Lambchop said from behind his newspaper . " Where 's Stanley ? " " Guess what ? " Arthur said again . Mrs. Lambchop sighed . " Oh , all right ! I ca n't guess . Tell . " " Stanley 's flat again , " said Arthur . Mr. Lambchop put down his paper . Mrs. Lambchop closed her eyes . " Flat again ? Is that what you said ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . " Stanley stood now beside Arthur in the doorway . " Just look . " " Good grief ! " said Mr. Lambchop . " I ca n't believe that bulletin board  --  " " It did n't fall on me this time , " Stanley said . " I just got flat . Arthur tried to pump me up , like before , but it hurt too much . " " Oh , Stanley ! " Mrs. Lambchop ran to kiss him . " How do you feel now ? " " Fine , actually , " Stanley said . " Just surprised . Can I go to school ? " Mrs. Lambchop thought for a moment . " Very well . Eat your breakfast . After school we 'll hear what Dr. Dan has to say . "
