Functional spaces . More comfort . These are the qualities you 'll find on the latest sedan bridge from this popular American boat builder . One of the most impressive features on the 341 is the bridge , which is roomier than some others in its competitive class . The builder achieved more usable space here by extending the bridge farther aft . As a result , there are seats for the skipper and a companion at the helm , plus a bench for up to five passengers at the rear . And because the bench is a wraparound-type , it makes it easier for guests to sit more naturally and face each other when talking . Another benefit of the extended bridge is the overhang it creates in the cockpit . This " roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the cockpit in all types of conditions . Enclose the area with the optional canvas , turn on the soft-blue LED lights and you have a cozy , all-weather entertaining area . The bridge is also an excellent place from which to run the 341 . Sightlines are exceptional , as you would imagine , with enviable visibility in all directions . Thus , close quarters maneuvering is significantly less stressful . I tested the Meridian in Florida 's Biscayne Bay . With two 320-hp MerCruiser gasoline inboards as propulsion , the boat accelerated fairly well for its size . Elapsed time from zero to 30 mph was about 24 seconds . Top speed was respectable : 32 mph . I put the boat into a series of tight , 360-degree turns at speed . The oversized propellers never gave up their grip , and the boat maneuvered nimbly for its weight . Then , running straight and level , steering response was immediate and precise . In its handling , the 341 delivered on its overall mission to make cruising more enjoyable : The ride was both soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio warned of four-foot seas . The boat 's handling manners were most impressive at the dock . Force from both bow and stern thrusters is coordinated by Docking On Command ( DOC ) , a system that 's exclusive to the Meridian brand and standard on each model . To operate the system , you use what looks like a joystick control , only it does n't have a lever . Instead , there 's a knob shaped like a boat . Point the knob towards 11 o'clock and the bowthruster swings the bow to port . Rotate the bottom of the knob towards five o'clock and the stern thruster swings the boat 's aft end to starboard . Jigger the knob sideways to nine o'clock and both thrusters work in perfect harmony , crabbing the boat 90 degrees to port . Armed with DOC , I was able to " walk " the test boat into its slip with the transmission out of gear and the engine idling away quietly . Of course , you can dock the old fashioned way , too . The 341 spins wide-diameter propellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio . Big props and big gears equal a heavy-duty column of water working against the rudder . As a result , you can dock the 341 at low rpm without applying throttle . Adeptly move into position with helm corrections ; shift as necessary into forward and reverse gears . The engine room is of modest size , which is no big surprise on this boat , given the laws of physics . Even though it 's virtually a crawl space , there 's still ample room for routine maintenance work . On the transom , I discovered a neat , shore power cord-management system that keeps the tangle out from underfoot . The simple solution : a gutter and board arrangement . As for cabin accommodations , the 341 boasts a wide-open floor plan with plenty of big windows and natural light . At day 's end , draw down the fitted curtains for privacy . There 's no dedicated dining area here , but there is a table suitable for place settings . The settee reclines . Furniture is upholstered in premium leather . The entertainment center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 20-inch flatscreen TV , a DVD-player and stereo . The galley to port includes a fridge/freezer , a microwave , electric cooktop , a Karadon countertop and cherry wood cabinets . Joinery was so tight I 'm willing to bet the drawers could hold water . The master stateroom is forward , with a queen-size island berth , plenty of storage ( including a hanging locker ) and private access to the head with shower stall . ( A second access door , for use by guests , is in the companionway . ) Nearby , the aft cabin has two single berths that can make up into a double with a filler cushion . By the time I finished my test , I had determined that Meridian 's all-new 341 is easy to handle and one of the most comfortable sedan-style models in its class . It 's the kind of boat you could live aboard and yet feel pampered at the same time . This article contains a table . Please see hardcopy of magazine . This article contains a table .
