" There are only three types of men working in the funeral trade : those born into it , those married into it , and those drawn into it . It 's the latter type that gives me pause . You were drawn here . Can you tell me why ? " A simple question , posed to me by Jerrold Anthony Stiles , manager and senior director of Morton-Albright Funeral Home and Memorial Chapel . I sat there in my black suit , praying for a simple answer to his question . I opened my mouth to speak , but nothing came out , and I could not leave Jerry 's office without a job . It was my twenty-first birthday , and I had spent the last twelve years of my life waiting for this moment . Now it had arrived , and I had nothing to say . Then I remembered the key in my pocket . The key would speak for me . I reached into my pocket and withdrew the handkerchief , embroidered with Jerry 's own initials . I stood up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I opened the handkerchief slowly , one fold at a time , to give myself a moment to think of words . None came to me , but I saw the change on Jerry 's face as I backed away . He was looking at it now , lying in the center of his own handkerchief : the key , shining like new brass -- an old skeleton key , seventy-five years old . The sun , streaming in through the window , made it gleam . " My God . " Jerry spoke in a quiet voice . With a look of slow deliberation , he moved his hand toward the object . Fingers set to grasp it , he paused , and looked at me . " May I ? " He asked . I nodded , thankful that I had not yet been required to speak , thankful that Jerry remembered the key . He picked up the key by its proper end . He leaned back in his chair and examined it , then transferred it to his palm , as though weighing it along with my intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me reprieve from my struggle for an answer . " How did this old key get so shiny ? " he asked . " It did n't look like this when I gave it to you . " I told Jerry that whenever I was scared or worried , whenever something bad happened to me , I would wrap my fingers around the key and squeeze it as tightly as I could . Every night , I went to sleep with the key in my fist . Every morning , it was still in my hand . I showed Jerry my palm . I had held on to the key so long and so tightly , it had left a permanent indentation in my hand . Because of the depth of the key 's indentation , Jerry supposed it had n't been easy for me , growing up an orphan . He said , " I remembered your family name as soon as you called for the interview . Your parents were Richard and Nancy Kight . Fortunately , we do n't hold many double funerals here at Morton-Albright . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for your folks . That plane crash was on all three channels . Tragedy always draws a crowd , son . Nineteen-sixty , I believe . " " Sixty-two , " I said . " I remember the crowd . I thought my parents were famous . " " They were , son . The crash made them famous . " Jerry began to recall the funeral . I relaxed in my chair and let him speak . He had watched me leave my parents ' service . When I did n't come right back , he searched the funeral home , looking for me . " I found you in the Rose Room , " he said . " There you were , standing on a kneeler , examining the body of an old man , lying in an open casket . " " You scared me , " I said . " I fell off the kneeler -- knocked the breath out of me . You came to me and rolled me over . I remember your face . I remember what I said to you : ' I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered Jerry 's eyes -- such a pale blue , I could see into them . His hair , now gray , had been as black as my suit . After finding me in the repose room , Jerry had brought me here , into the office . He told me if I wanted to be an Undertaker , I needed a key . He opened a cabinet and selected the skeleton key that now lay upon his desk . " This key used to open every door at Morton-Albright , " he 'd said . " Now it 's yours . It 's your Undertaker 's key . Come back and see me when you 're twenty-one . Bring your key . If you still want to be an Undertaker , I 'll give you a job . " Now I reminded Jerry of his promise . " Today is my twenty-first birthday , " I said . " Here is my key . I still want to be an Undertaker . " " But you still have n't told me why , " Jerry said . I still had no answer -- not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . Jerry kept talking . He said that I had been in shock that day -- nine years old . He confessed he had given me the key to get my mind off things -- a distraction . He had never expected to see me again -- not dressed in a black suit , looking for a job . " Most young men would n't dream of spending a birthday in a funeral home . " Jerry 's words hit me hard . My talisman key had been a distraction . I had dedicated my life to a toy . I was headed for depression , but I was struck by my own oddity , spending my birthday in a funeral home -- odd enough for a laugh , and the smile on Jerry 's face was growing larger . Now we were both laughing . Jerry was warming up to me . I could feel it . " Casey James Kight , " he said my name , shaking his head . He also said I did n't need to answer his question . I had already answered it -- by not answering . " You 're here out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in spouting off about helping the bereaved , when all they wanted was a peek at the back room -- nothing wrong with curiosity , but curiosity did n't make a good man . " I do n't know of any man in the trade who could rightly say why he 's in it . If it runs in your family , you 've got an excuse , or a tradition -- however you want to put it . " I promised Jerry I 'd work hard . " There 's something about this place , " I said . " It calls to me . " " Do n't ruin your interview with spooky talk , Casey . You were doing fine . You 're a well-mannered , clean-cut kid , and I detect sincerity . You can start tomorrow morning at seven a.m . Do n't get too excited -- last time we hired outside the trade , I swore I 'd never do it again . Think of your first day as a test -- it only takes a few hours to know for sure . " " Know what ? " " Whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told me not to buy any new clothes just yet . I could wear my black suit tomorrow . I asked him what was wrong with my suit -- it seemed appropriate for funeral work . He explained that it was an offense to the bereaved . " We do n't mourn with our families , and they know it . We serve them from a professional distance . " He told me not to worry , they would n't turn me loose on the public until I wore proper attire . He also promised to call the principal of Clearwater High School , for a reference . " I did n't go to Clearwater . I went to Dunedin . " " I thought you lived here in Angel Shores . " " I did , but my aunt Margee moved us out into the county after the accident . I went to Dunedin . " " That explains it , " Jerry said . " If you had gone to Clearwater , I would have met you long before now . " Jerry asked if he could hold on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other men . The thought of spending the night without my key brought sweat to my palms . I did n't want to risk an episode without my key , but the Presence of Morton-Albright had calmed me , and the indentation in my palm would remind me that the key was safe with Jerry . I did n't bother with the door of the green MG . The top was down , and the Florida heat had soaked me to my underwear by the time I made it across the blacktop of the Morton-Albright parking lot and hopped into my car . I yanked at my tie , and drove out onto Druid Road , the breeze in my face . I sniffed at the air , smelled the salt spray , and headed for Angel Shores Beach . I had n't been there since I was a kid . Aunt Margee hated the sand , and the sun was cruel to her fair skin . That was the reason I went to the beach that day , because Margee hated it so . I loved Margee . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , but the time had come for both of us to begin living our own separate lives . Margee had been only twenty-three when she became my adoptive mother . She was now thirty-five , and had never taken up with a man during our time together . She had devoted her life to caring for me . She had stood by my side at Tampa airport when the plane went down . Mom and Dad had won the Betty Beeson Home Permanent Hawaiian Getaway Sweepstakes -- six days and seven nights in Waikiki , and all because Mom had been born with straight hair . It was 1962 -- twelve years earlier . Jackie was in the White House , and my mother was one of millions of American women who now had a reason to experiment with glamour . The days of Eleanor Roosevelt , Bess Truman , and Mamie Eisenhower were over -- all respectable women , but none of them looked like Jackie . It nearly killed my dad to see the woman he married in pedal-pushers and short , wavy hair , but he got over it when the letter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the grand prize . At the beach now , with my hand to my forehead , I visored my eyes against the sun and surveyed the vastness of the Gulf of Mexico . I listened to the cry of gulls mingled with the sound of the waves . Another familiar sound rose up into the air from behind me -- the high-pitched noise of cicadas in the scrub across Beach Road . For a moment , the sounds all fell together , creating a single auditory event : the sound of my own name , like a whisper . " Casey . " I whipped around , startled -- it seemed to have come from behind me . I looked across the road at a vacant lot of dirty sand , scrub , a few short pines . Through the pines I saw a clearing , and a giant coquina rock -- an elevated view of the Gulf . I sat down on the big rock , careful of the only suit I owned . I removed my shoes and emptied them of the sand from climbing up the ridge . I could barely hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water was obscured by scrub . My interest diverted to the clearing itself , I noticed it was perfectly circular . A road , strewn with fallen pine needles , wound into deeper wood . I heard the sound of my name again -- still in a whisper , but muffled , as though it came from under the ground . The noise of the cicadas intensified , as if in response to the voice . I began to feel dizzy , probably from the heat . The noise became so loud , I covered my ears . It was n't insects I was hearing anymore -- it was the whine of jet engines , ready for takeoff . I was nine years old again , standing in the observation area of Tampa airport , holding Margee 's hand , watching the Hawaiian Trans-Pacific jetliner surge down the runway -- the jet climbing into the air , then falling out of the turquoise sky . The explosion at the end of the runway . The column of fire shooting upward , blossoming into a flower of black fire . Sick-faced adults , scrambling for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crash seemed impossible -- I expected to see my parents running from the wreckage , frightened they 'd worried me ; but the heat from the explosion roared into my face , and burned away the calm , thrusting me into the chaos that surrounded me . I knew that Mom and Dad were in the plane , burning at the end of the runway . My breath quickened ; my heart ready to explode , like the airplane . Margee and I turned to each other , wide-eyed , mirroring horror . With hardly a motion , I scaled the fence of the observation area and ran down the runway toward the fire . Margee screamed my name . My lungs burned as I ran . I saw a flash of yellow ; my feet left the ground . A fireman had snatched me up . I tore at his yellow slicker , trying to free myself . I kicked at him and begged , " Let me go ! They 're in there ! We 've got to get them out ! They 'll burn up if we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground , his blackened face streaked with tears . He lowered himself , eye-level with me . " Who 's in there , son ? " he asked . " Your mama ? Your daddy ? " " No ! " I heard myself scream aloud . I looked up into the sky from my perch on the coquina rock . I saw the big tail of a passenger jet , on its approach to the airport , screaming overhead . I wiped my face , wet with tears and sweat . I drove back into town , gritting my teeth , awaiting the calm that always followed an episode . The calm was nothing more than a self-imposed state of shock . Over the years , I had taught myself to prolong the calm . I prolonged it by pushing everything from my mind except my path to Morton-Albright . I knew the purpose of the episodes -- my own mind was trying to jolt me out of my shock and make me remember . I did n't want to remember -- not yet , for I suspected terror in the memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believed that the memories lying beneath could only be worse . I wanted to remember them , but not until I was safe at Morton-Albright , the only place of comfort I had ever known . For now , I was postponing the memories , but it was becoming more difficult . Occasionally , some event would trigger an episode . It could be something as simple as brushing my teeth , or something more obviously tied to the crash , like the sound of a jet airliner , passing overhead . After each episode , I remembered pieces of my childhood . Today at the beach , I remembered the real reason why Margee stopped taking me there -- not because of her fair skin but because the beach was on the air-traffic approach to Tampa airport . I knew only two distinct states of mind : the episode , and the tranquil path to remembrance . Because of this , I had few memories of my childhood . I could barely remember my life before the crash . I had only faded pictures of my mom and dad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , or had hidden them from me . I suspected the latter , because Margee was not the kind of person who 'd throw away photographs of her own brother . As I drove through town , the deceitful calm of shock settled in . I marveled at the old beauty of Angel Shores . The courthouse square , shaded by ancient trees , was surrounded by family-owned businesses , including a real soda fountain , where they still served blue-plate specials and mixed Coca-Cola syrup with carbonated water . The old money in Angel Shores had ensured the town 's preservation . Nobody cared about progress except in the unincorporated county , where Margee and I lived , with all the discount stores and car dealerships . In Angel Shores proper , no new construction was allowed to stand more than three stories high , and its look had to fit in with the small-town motif . The rules of preservation had impacted Angel Shores in an unexpected way : the town itself had become a tourist attraction . People came from all over to see life as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , and there was nothing more old South about Angel Shores than Skeeter 's Real Open-pit Barbecue . Skeeter 's family had brought the art of barbecue with them from rural Georgia . You could smell it all over town . Margee and I loved eating there , so I pulled the MG into a gas station and called her from a pay phone . I asked her to meet me at Skeeter 's for dinner . She hammered me with questions about my job interview . I 'd tell her all about it over a pork sandwich and Brunswick stew . From a picnic table inside Skeeter 's Barbecue , I watched Margee enter the restaurant . I did n't signal her right away . Instead , I sat there for a moment , watching Margee look nervous , scanning the place through her sunglasses . She always forgot to take them off , and would remember only when she realized she could n't see a damn thing . I watched her fumble them into her purse . She spied me , rolled her eyes , and headed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look at your white shirt , " she said . " How did you manage to get dirty at your job interview ? Have they got you digging graves already ? " " No , but I saw some really scary stuff . Wan na hear about it ? " " You stop that , Casey . It 's a funeral home , for godssake . It 's creepy " Morton-Albright was not creepy , I insisted . It was the most beautiful mansion in Angel Shores , its lobby full of hand-crafted antiques , velvet sofas and chairs , tables of polished oak , all illuminated by a thousand prisms of a giant chandelier . " Jerry was good to me , " I said . " He gave me the job . " " Mr. Stiles is a nice gentleman . I 'm sure he does n't go around scaring his aunt Margee . " " That 's because he does n't have an aunt Margee . I start tomorrow morning . " We ate our dinner in silence -- in the silence of the argument that had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Undertaker at Morton-Albright . Margee wanted me to be anything but an Undertaker . She did n't understand -- it was my calling : " The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning . " A verse from Ecclesiastes . Morton-Albright was the house of mourning . I knew if I dwelt there , my heart would become wise . I would remember everything , in the only place of comfort I had ever known . It did n't matter that Jerry had given me the key as a distraction . It only mattered that he had given me a key . It was the key to everything . Margee knew it , too -- she was n't really worried I 'd see something bad . She worried I would remember . " All you 'll find is more death , " Margee said . " It will only make you more sad . " " I ca n't be any more sad . I 've been sad all my life . I want to be happy , like everybody else . " I had felt happiness today , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm chills began -- the Presence of Morton-Albright fell upon me . I was home . I had been able to speak with Jerry about the crash , without worrying about an episode . I knew what Margee was thinking . She worried about more than my remembering . I just sat there , waiting for her to say it . " How are you ever going to meet a girl in a funeral home ? " She said it . " You 're twenty-one . You 've never brought a girl home . You 've never even been on a date . " " Neither have you , " I said . " Besides , all the girls at school thought I was a freak . " " What did you expect ? How many other boys came to school in a black suit ? I had good reason for staying away from men . " I knew what was coming next : Margee 's lecture about how she had given up her romantic life to raise me , how she had n't wanted some guy hanging around , pretending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way through dessert . At the foot of my bed , I spied my mother 's cedar chest . I had n't opened it in a long time . It filled the room with an old , relaxing aroma . Inside were my treasures : Mom 's handmade quilt , Dad 's army flashlight , and a cardboard box full of fourteen Green Hornet comics , each one in its own protective sleeve . I also owned a toy replica of Black Beauty , the Green Hornet 's car . I figured on a sleepless night , so I prepared myself . Despite the warmth of April , I flung my mother 's quilt onto my bed . I turned off the lights , pushed the switch on the flashlight , and laid myself down in comic-reading position . The Green Hornet looked at me from the cover of issue number three . My dad had made me wash my hands just to look at the comics while he turned the pages , never mind touching them . Dad liked the Green Hornet because of his clothing -- a normal men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not like those sissy heroes with their leotards and superpowers . " The Green Hornet fought like a man . Actually , most of the real fighting was done by Kato , the Hornet 's sidekick and chauffeur . And although the Green Hornet himself had no superpowers of his own , his car , Black Beauty , had plenty of secret armaments , which made for great car-chase scenes , especially in the TV series . I 'll never forget that first Friday night when Black Beauty roared onto our television set . " Faster , Kato ! " The Green Hornet called from the backseat of the souped-up 1966 Chrysler Imperial . My toy replica looked just like it . I had washed my hands thoroughly before bed , and was opening the comic book when Margee 's knock came at the door . She walked in and sat down on my bed . She did n't say anything for a long time , as though working on exact phrasing . Her first sentences were in fragments . I aimed the flashlight toward our faces so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me how she had mourned my parents , and how she had tried to save me from it . " Grieving hurts so bad , " she said . " I did n't want you to feel it . Now you 're going to a place where people feel it every day . I know I ca n't stop you , so maybe I was wrong to try . If you have to go , then go . Find what you 're looking for . You can always come home . " I let Margee hug me that night . I told her not to worry -- maybe I 'd meet a nice girl at a funeral .
