Section : special focus : Changing Perspectives in Music Education <p> In the past fifty years , different psychological theories of learning have had profound effects on the methodology of teaching music . <p> Since World War II , music educators have embraced four schools of thought regarding educational psychology : behaviorism , cognitivism , humanism , and , more recently , a socio/biological model to which no label has yet been applied . This article discusses some of the contributions that each approach has made to understanding the processes involved in music learning . Behavioralism : Positive Reinforcement Builds Tomorrow 's Citizens <p> In the first two decades following the second world war , Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner became the voice of behaviorism by suggesting that learning should be positively reinforced and that a child 's motivation to learn was external. 1 Behaviorists saw the mind as the composite product of experience : a child may be born with a brain-but education turns it into a mind . Working from such a premise , schools seemed to hold the power to mold children into the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems facing education were inefficient , ineffective instruction and negative reinforcement of psychological development-problems that would lead to unrealized potential and to continuing struggles with achievement and interpersonal relations . If schools could be the place where positive growth experiences occurred , then society 's social ills could be ameliorated and a new society would emerge . <p> The effort to make instruction efficient and effective centered on the " behavioral objective , " which defined the learner , the action , and the assessment in a way that assured that learning was active and sequential and that assessment was based on demonstrable actions . MENC led the profession 's efforts to bring music instruction in line with this psychological position . Under its sponsorship , J. David Boyle and others provided guides for developing and implementing objectives in the music curriculum . Statements such as " The student will describe the difference between any two of the tempo indications lento , andante , and allegro and illustrate in 4/4 meter by playing , singing , moving , or tapping " or " The student will listen to six compositions by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate a model of behavioral learning. 2 The totality of behavioral objectives defined the curriculum and established a framework for lesson plans and student evaluation . <p> Principals and teachers implemented behavioral objectives in an effort to assure that all observers knew on any given day , at any given hour , exactly what the teacher was doing and what the student was responsible for knowing . In reality , schools rarely achieved the level of controlled learning implied by behavioral objectives . Some teachers filed them in a drawer and forgot them . Many completed the writing exercises but found that implementing the objectives placed a rigid and exacting format on classroom and rehearsal activities , which stymied the vitality and effervescence of musical learning . Also , the objectives were hard for music teachers to implement because group and ensemble activities made daily individual assessments difficult . Some teachers may remember Edwin Gordon 's detailed assessment criteria for his Music Aptitude Profile , which required exact weekly record keeping of each student 's development. 3 <p> Another principle of behaviorist thought suggested that a child was motivated to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , many of whom have used contests and other incentives as integral aspects of ensemble study since the 1920s . The star for completing the piano exercise , the PTA performance , the medal at a contest , the trip to Disneyland , or the trophy for ensemble work were models of external reinforcement already in place . Many areas of the school curriculum saw music as the model for this principle . Throughout the 1960s and 1970s , math contests , district- and state-level science fairs , poetry contests , and a host of other events grew in popularity in an effort to provide various means of public recognition that would motivate students to excel and would demonstrate the effectiveness of these educational activities . <p> Such rewards , however , could easily become substitutes for learning . Has the student in band made a serious choice to study music or just to travel to away-games with the football squad and the cheerleaders ? Not all teachers and parents were convinced that the mind consisted merely of what experience had made it . Music teachers , who had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music classroom or rehearsal hall , were not satisfied that behavioral objectives could pin that joy down in learning units or could schedule the day and hour that it would occur . Learning may be active , but the behavioral objectives that guided learning often seemed too reductionist for parents and teachers . Some other explanation was needed to capture the dynamic of music learning . Cognitivism : Each Child Should Be Nurtured <p> Just when behaviorism had taken hold in American schools , a counter-argument dubbed " cognitivism " was introduced ( see the sidebar for a summary of psychological theories and music pedagogy ) . In 1960 , Jerome Bruner , recently returned to the U.S. from his work with Jean Piaget 4 in France , published The Process of Education. 5 Bruner 's book outlined a view of childhood learning in which the mind was seen to develop through distinct stages . In each stage , which he defined as enactive , iconic , and symbolic , the child saw the world differently . Bruner convinced many that , if education was to be effective , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his contributions had become the common parlance of conferences and curricular workshops and offered a solid foundation for efforts to understand music learning . <p> Cognitivists such as Bruner and Piaget returned " mind " to the debate about learning and allowed teachers to see children as active , independent learners who are quite capable of making decisions and acting on their own behalf . Classroom and rehearsal activities could be organized around music concepts , and children could be allowed to discover a variety of interpretations depending on their own preferences and levels of maturity . For example , timbre could be introduced conceptually and broadly with the cognitive approach , whereas the behavioral model had required the teacher to explicitly define all important aspects of timbre in learning objectives , which limited the creative variations that students might bring to the lesson . The cognitive approach seemed to open up the music classroom to creative play as a way to reinforce concepts . <p> As a result , cognitivists downplayed the importance of curriculum . With behaviorists , if the child 's brain could become a mind only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each student had equal experiences and assessment measures . However , with the cognitivist view , if each child 's mind was natural , curious , and unique , then the child 's right to grow and develop could not be forced into generalized expectations or predetermined curricular goals . Education had to be individualized and paced differently for each student . This view accepted the importance of cultural influences outside the classroom and allowed various cultural distinctions to be recognized and discussed . <p> In certain ways , American cognitivist efforts resonated with another philosophy of learning expressed earlier by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his book Emile. 6 Rousseau saw the child as a unique creature , needing open-ended , creative play in order to develop . Bruner and others argued that the best way to educate the child was through guided activities that were geared to the child 's level of maturity and allowed the child to discover information . By contrast , behaviorists shared some of Frederick Taylor 's concepts of social efficiency and uplift ( which had guided American business in the first half of the twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be molded into a healthy and productive adult through an appropriately standardized education. 7 Behavioral principles atomized instruction into measurable units that seemed to make schools into " businesses " that could measure the product easily against costs . <p> Most schools tried to embrace both views . While parents and teachers saw each child as unique and provided individualized instruction and support as resources permitted , the school spoke of standards measured by SAT scores and college admissions tests . American music teachers continue to live in these two worlds . On one hand , we plead for fewer students in our classes so that music learning can be tailored to individual achievement levels , yet we run to the nearest festival or contest to illustrate how group or ensemble achievement is assessed against other schools . Humanism : The Highest Potential Realized through Art <p> In the midst of this debate , a third school of psychology captured the attention of many music educators . Carl Rogers 8 and Abraham Maslow , 9 along with a number of other American psychologists , theorized not so much about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of music study . Maslow 's work tied arts study to the highest level of psychological development , which he called " self-actualization " -a stage wherein children are involved in activities that challenge their highest intellectual potentials . This school of thought was less concerned about designing procedures for developing mental functions and more focused on identifying the levels of maturity , attention , and pleasure in which music study could have full impact on the student 's emotional life . Many tenets of aesthetic education , which are based on these humanistic principles , are often echoed in the writings of Bennett Reimer 10 and Ralph Smith. 11 Re-Evaluating , plus a Socio/Biological Model <p> Since the 1980s , education has experienced a backlash against the cognitivist school of thought . In 1983 , U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett and others challenged a psychology ( and its pedagogy ) that allowed schools to uncouple a child 's achievement from societal demands for universal standards. 12 Rather than allowing cognitive theories to play out in ever more individualized instruction and subjective assessments , states across the country began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within this climate when it published the National Standards for Arts Education. 13 While these standards are voluntary , they were made possible because public debate under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush reinstated the possibility of national standards for educational practice , a direct challenge to a psychology that had moved schools from normed assessment to subjective , individualized measures of student learning such as the portfolio . <p> In the 1990s , Frances Rauscher began publishing her work on the short-term spatial memory gains that students experienced in lab settings. 14 The " Mozart-makes-you-smarter " phenomenon became national news . Rauscber , Donald G. Campbell , 15 and others suggested that certain experiences with music may promote neural changes that could translate into greater achievement . Their work implies that learning has a biological foundation that can be altered through exposure to music . This concept shifts the focus of learning from psychology to biology and can alter the way that the goals of music instruction are interpreted . Previously , the behavioral , cognitive , or humanistic views directed the outcome of music instruction to a psychological goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic dimensions of the human personality-Bennett Reimer is our most articulate spokesperson in this regard . This new biological theory counters psychology as the primary value for the study of music , supplanting it with a more fundamental goal-actual changes in cerebral tissue growth that may result in enhanced mental function . For some , that would place music education on a more solid , " scientific " foundation ; yet , to date , this biological theory has constituted only a premise for further research rather than the development of a learning model . One thing is clear , however : in the 1990s , the psychological models that had guided our professional efforts for most of the twentieth century were challenged by a biological model that could shift the focus on music learning dramatically . <p> The theory that music makes a physiological difference that enhances learning is alluring-what greater rationale for music education than the idea that it can engender greater success in other areas of schooling ? However , efforts to implement this claim have focused not on brain development per se but , rather , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals of general education . Since the early 1990s , music education conferences have sponsored sessions in which music educators speak of their successes with integrating music into other subject areas and share anecdotal evidence demonstrating that the presence of music can transform the subject matter of the lesson . The history lesson on China is more vivid for students who sing Chinese folk songs , for example . Fractions and other proportional concepts are reinforced when students learn musical rhythm and meter . Poetic stress is underscored by strong/weak beat studies in elementary music . Social and ethnic identities are highlighted when musics of varying styles and genres are performed . These examples illustrate ways in which music may be used in other curriculum areas but can never serve as viable rationales for music instruction . The study of music 's unique communicative power and structure is valid on its own ; for this reason , music education must not be lost in the rush to serve the goals of general learning . If music can make us smarter , then why not let it be for the greater understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make learning active and to develop children who would consciously embrace the values and content of their learning . However , that mode of defining and codifying learning seemed to reduce the child 's mind to merely the product of a curriculum . The cognitivists suggested that the child , as a whole person , was as active as the learning in which he or she was engaged . The mind was circumscribed only by the perceptual limitations of physical maturation . By introducing the claim that maturation was key to learning , the cognitivists were the first to introduce biology to the educational arena . But Rauscher 's work was the first indication that a physical change to the brain might occur through exposure to music study . The humanists reminded us that , regardless of one 's perspective , music study calls us to our highest potential . <p> One final observation in this journey through the last half-century : while the biological model is nascent , the psychological models of behaviorism , cognitivism , and humanism continue to influence our thinking profoundly . The taxonomies that Bloom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still provide structural models for learning that help music teachers think more clearly about lesson planning . Terms like " positive reinforcement , " " time-out , " " active learning , " and " programmed instruction " are embedded in our teaching vocabulary . Behavioral objectives allow music learning to be expressed in concrete terms and codified into full curricula . Cognitivism provides templates for what might be taught at what age , as well as rationales for individualized instruction . Humanism reminds us that the study of music reaches deeply into the values that make us civilized beings . <p> Behaviorism renewed the public debate about what kinds of education our society desired for its children and how schools could best provide it . Cognitivism recategorized " the mind " into distinct stages of mental activity and suggested that children 's performance differences can be better explained by level of maturity and experience than by inherent ability . We stand armed with the work of three generations of music educators who , by applying these psychological theories , have created methods and materials that continue to guide our professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
