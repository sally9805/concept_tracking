Chapter One Chicago , 2006 " Oh God , Abby . Do n't panic . Just ... do n't ... panic . " Sucking in a deep breath , Abby Barlow pressed her hands to her heaving stomach and studied the shards of pottery that lay splintered across the floor . Okay , so she broke a vase . Well , perhaps more than broke it . It was more like she shattered , decimated , and annihilated the vase , she grudgingly conceded . Big deal . It was not the end of the world . A vase was a vase . Was n't it ? She abruptly grimaced . No , a vase was not just a vase . Not when it was a very rare vase . A priceless vase . One that should no doubt have been in a museum . One that was the dream of any collector and ... Freaking hell . Panic once again reared its ugly head . She had destroyed a priceless Ming vase . What if she lost her job ? Granted , it was n't much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stepping into the Twilight Zone each time she entered the elegant mansion on the outskirts of Chicago . But her position as companion to Selena LaSalle was hardly demanding . And the pay was considerably better than slinging hash in some sleazy dive . The last thing she needed was to be back in the long lines at the unemployment office . Or worse ... dear God , what if she was expected to pay for the blasted vase ? Even if there was such a thing as a half-price sale at the local Mingoutlet shop , she would have to work ten lifetimes to make such a sum . Always supposing that it was not one of a kind . Panic was no longer merely rearing . It was thundering through her at full throttle . There was only one thing to be done , she realized . The mature , responsible , adult thing to do . Hide the evidence . Covertly glancing about the vast foyer , Abby ensured that she was alone before lowering herself to her knees and gathering the numerous shards that littered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice the vase was missing , she tried to reassure herself . Selena had always been a recluse , but in the past two weeks , she had all but disappeared . If it was n't for her occasional cameo appearances to demand that Abby prepare that disgusting herb concoction she guzzled with seeming pleasure , Abby might have thought that the woman had done a flit . Certainly Selena did n't roam the house taking inventory of her various knickknacks . All Abby needed to do was ensure that she did n't leave any trace of her crime and surely all would be well . No one would ever know . No one . " My , my , I never thought to see you on your hands and knees , lover . A most intriguing position that leads to all sorts of delicious possibilities , " a mocking voice drawled from the entrance to the drawing room . Abby closed her eyes and heaved in a deep breath . She was cursed . That had to be it . What else could possibly explain her unending run of bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , futilely hoping Selena 's houseguest , the utterly annoying Dante , would disappear . It could happen . There was always spontaneous combustion , or black holes , or earthquakes . Unfortunately , the ground did n't open up to swallow him , nor did the smoke detectors set off a warning . Even worse , she could actually feel his dark , amused gaze leisurely meandering over her stiff form . Gathering her battered pride , Abby forced herself to slowly turn , and keeping the broken vase hidden behind her as she regarded the current bane of her existence . He did n't look like a bane . God 's truth , he looked like a delicious , dangerously wicked pirate . Still kneeling upon the floor , Abby allowed her gaze to travel over the black biker boots and long , powerful legs encased in faded denims . Ever higher she skimmed over the black silk shirt that hung loosely upon his torso . Loose , but not loose enough , she acknowledged with a renegade shiver . Much to her embarrassment , she had caught herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silky shirts during the past three months . All right , maybe she had indulged in more than mere peeks . Maybe she had been staring . Gawking . Ogling . Occasionally drooling . What woman would n't ? Gritting her teeth , she forced her gaze up to the alabaster face with its perfectly chiseled features . A wide brow , a narrow aristocratic nose , sharply defined cheekbones and lushly carved lips . They all came together with a fierce elegance . It was the face of a noble warrior . A chieftain . Until one noticed those pale , silver eyes . There was nothing noble in those disturbing eyes . They were piercing , wicked , and shimmering with a mocking amusement toward the world . They were eyes that branded him a " badass " as easily as the long raven hair that carelessly tumbled well past his shoulders and the golden hoops he wore in his ears . He was sex on legs . A predator . The sort that chewed up and spat out women like her with pathetic ease . That was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place . Which was not very damn often . " Dante . Do you have to skulk about like that ? " she demanded , desperately aware of the priceless clutter just behind her . He made a show of considering her question before offering a faint shrug . " No , I do n't suppose I have to skulk about , " he murmured in his husky midnight voice . " I simply enjoy doing so . " " Well , it 's a very vulgar habit . " His lips twitched with amusement as he prowled ever closer . " Oh , I possess far more vulgar habits , sweet Abby . Several that I do n't doubt you would enjoy fully if only you would allow me to demonstrate . " God , she just bet he did . Those slender , devilish hands would no doubt make a woman scream in pleasure . And those lips ... Abruptly she was squashing the renegade fantasy and stirring up the annoyance she most certainly should be feeling . " Ack . You 're revolting . " " Vulgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white teeth . " My sweet , you are in a very precarious position to be tossing about such insults . " Precarious ? She battled the urge to glance down and discover if any shards of her crime were visible . " I do n't know what you mean . " With a flowing elegance , Dante was on his knees before her , those disturbing fingers lifting to lightly stroke her cheek . His touch was cool , almost cold , but it sent a startling flare of heat searing through her . " Oh , I think you do . I seem to recall a rather precious Ming vase that used to sit upon that table . Tell me , lover , did you hock it or break it ? " Damn . He knew . She desperately attempted to think of some feasible lie to explain the missing vase . Or for that matter , any lie , feasible or not . Unfortunately , she had never been particularly skilled at prevarication . And it did n't much help that his lingering touch was turning her brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she at last lamely muttered . " What ? " His brows lifted . " Lover . " " Why ? " " For the obvious fact that I 'm not your lover . " " Not yet . " " Not ever . " " Tsk , tsk . " Dante clicked his tongue as his fingers moved to boldly outline her lips . " Has no one ever warned you that it is dangerous to dare fate ? It has curve of her neck . " Sometimes quite literally . " " Not in a million years . " " I can wait , " he husked . She gritted her teeth as those skillful fingers traveled down the arch of her throat and along the neckline of her plain cotton shirt . He was merely toying with her . Hell , the man would flirt with any woman who possessed a pulse . And maybe a few who did n't . " That finger moves any lower and your stay in the world is going to be considerably shorter . " He gave a soft chuckle as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , Abby , someday you 're going to forget to say no . And on that day , I intend to make you scream with pleasure . " " My God , how do you possibly carry that ego around ? " His smile was purely wicked . " Do you think I do n't notice ? All those covert glances when you think I 'm not looking ? The way you shiver when I brush past you ? The dreams that haunt your nights ? " Conceited , puffed-up toad . She should laugh . Or pooh-pooh . Or even slap his arrogant face . Instead she stiffened as if he had hit a nerve that she did n't even know she possessed . " Do n't you have somewhere you need to be ? " she gritted . " The kitchen ? The sewers ? The fires of hell ? " Surprisingly the pirate features hardened as his lips twisted into a sardonic smile . " Nice try , my sweet , but I do n't need you to condemn me to the fires of hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I be here ? " Abby gave a lift of her brows , intrigued in spite of herself by his hint of bitterness . For God 's sake , what more could he want ? He possessed the sort of cushy life that most oversexed playboys could only dream of . A glamorous home . Expensive clothes . A silver Porsche . And a sugar mommy who was not only young , but beautiful enough to make any male hot and bothered . His life was hardly in the gutter . Unlike her own . " Oh yes , you must really suffer , " she retorted , her gaze flicking over the silk shirt that cost more than her entire wardrobe . " My heart simply breaks for you . " The silver eyes flashed with a startling heat as the fierce power that always smoldered about him prickled through the air . " Do not presume to speak of things you know nothing about , lover , " he warned . Just let it be , Abby , she sternly warned herself . Whatever his easy charm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only fools deliberately toyed with fire . Of course , when it came to men , she might as well have the word idiot tattooed on her forehead . " If you dislike being here , then why do n't you leave ? " He regarded her in unnerving silence before his eyes slowly narrowed . " Why do n't you ? " " What ? " " I 'm not the only one suffering here , am I ? Every day you seem to fade a bit more . As if your frustration and sadness has taken another piece of your soul . " Abby nearly tumbled backward at his sharp perception . She had never dreamed that anyone could possibly have noted her desperation at her tedious existence , nor the budding fear that she would soon be too old and tired to care that she was going nowhere . Certainly not this man . " You do n't know anything . " " I know a prison when I see one , " he murmured . " Why do you remain behind the bars when you could so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humorless laugh . Easily ? Obviously he was not nearly so perceptive as she had given him credit for . " Because I need this job . Unlike you , I do n't have a generous lover to pay my bills and keep me in style . Some of us have to earn our pay with actual work . " If she thought to insult him , she was far off the mark . In fact , her sharp words merely returned that mocking humor she found so damn annoying . " You believe me to be Selena 's whore ? " " Are n't you ? " He lifted a broad shoulder . " Our ... relationship is a bit more complex than that . " " Oh yes , no doubt being a boy toy to a rich , glamorous woman is astonishingly complex . " " Is that why you try to keep me at a distance ? Because you believe I share Selena 's bed ? " " I keep you at a distance because I do n't like you . " He leaned forward , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not like me , sweetness , but that does n't keep you from wanting me . " Her heart forgot to beat as she struggled not to close that shallow distance and put herself out of her misery . A kiss . Just one kiss . The tingling need was nearly unbearable . No , no , no . Did she really want to be a poor joke to relieve his boredom ? Had n't she played that humiliating game before ? " Do you know , Dante , I 've met my share of jackasses in my time , but you- " The rather tidy insult was brought to a stunning halt . In the air there was a sudden , crackling heat . As electrifying as a strike of lightning . Unnerved by the prickling sensation , she turned her head toward the stairs just as a thundering concussion ripped through the house . Caught off guard , she tumbled backward , her breath knocked from her body . Just for a moment she lay perfectly still . She half-expected the ceiling to come crumbling down upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What the blazes had happened ? An earthquake ? A gas explosion ? The end of the world ? Whatever it was , it had been enough to tumble the pictures from the walls and knock over tables . Suddenly the Ming vase she had broken matched every other priceless object . Giving a shake of her head to clear the ringing in her ears , Abby sucked in a deep breath . Well , at least she seemed to be alive , she told herself . And while she was certain to be sporting a few bruises , she did n't think anything vital was actually missing or punctured . Lying flat on her back , she barely heard the low feral growl , but it still managed to make the hair upon her nape stand upright . Dear Lord , now what ? Struggling to push herself upright , she glanced about the littered foyer . Astonishingly it was empty . No wild animal . No approaching madman . And no Dante . With a frown , Abby ignored her wobbly knees and forced herself toward the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit by the explosion ? Or thrown from the foyer ? Had he simply disappeared in a puff of smoke ? No , no , of course not . She pressed a hand to her aching head . She was thinking crazy . She must have been knocked unconscious for a moment . That would explain it . No doubt he had gone to check on the damage . Or to call for assistance . Her job was surely to ensure that Selena was not injured . Concentrating upon placing one foot in front of the other , a startlingly difficult task , she managed to climb the sweeping marble stairs and awkwardly make her way down the hallway . At the end of the long east wing , the door to Selena 's chambers was already open and Abby stepped over the threshold . She got no farther . A gasp was wrenched from her throat as her wide gaze swept over the demolished room . Like downstairs , the pictures and various objects had been tumbled to the ground , most of them smashed beyond recognition . But here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places crumbled to dust . Even the windows had been blasted from their frames . Her gaze flew to the large bed that was tumbled onto its side and at last to the center of the room where Dante was kneeling beside a limp , battered form . " Oh my God . " Holding her hands to her mouth , Abby stumbled forward , her heart firmly lodged in her throat . " Selena . " Noticing her presence for the first time , Dante jerked his head up to regard her with a frown . Almost absently , Abby noted the even sharper pallor of his skin and the oddly hectic glitter in his silver eyes . Obviously he was as shaken as she was . " Get out of here , " he growled . She ignored his warning as she fell to her knees beside the burned body . Whatever her secret dislike for the beautiful , coldhearted woman , it was forgotten as tears streamed down her cheeks . " Is she ... dead ? " she croaked . " Abby , I said to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this house ... " The dark , furious words continued , but Abby was no longer listening . Instead she watched in fascinated horror as one of the charred hands twitched upon the carpet . Holy freaking hell . Could the poor woman still be alive ? Or was it some horrible trick of her imagination ? Frozen in shock , Abby stared at the fingers that continued to jerk and spasm ever closer . It was like something out of a nightmare . A sensation that only deepened when the hand snapped upward and grasped her wrist in a painful grasp . Opening her mouth to scream , Abby discovered her breath wrenched from her body . A coldness was spreading from the fingers that dug into her flesh . A coldness that crawled through her blood with a searing , ruthless agony . With a groan , she desperately attempted to tug herself free of the brutal grip . She was going to die , she realized in stunned disbelief . The pain was clawing at her heart , slowing its beat until it was doomed to halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even bothered to start living yet . (
