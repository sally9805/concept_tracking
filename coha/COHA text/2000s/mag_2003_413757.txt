Success comes from focusing on what really works , not gambling on getting one good tree hound out of many pups tried . " So says Jerry Shaffer , the nationally known Charleston , W.Va. , coonhound trainer , and what he means by what works , of course , is a pup from a proven mating . But results from a repeated proven mating of his own hounds revealed to Shaffer how much the best genes in a selected breed can be enhanced by changes in training . While pups from the first litter became excellent coonhounds , those from the second litter started earlier , took direction better , learned faster and became superior hunters at an earlier age . The difference ? For starters , with the second litter Shaffer hunted the dam in the last third of pregnancy so the pups could begin life with greater enthusiasm for the chase , and apparently all did . But the most dramatic change took place when Jerry 's wife , Yvonne , insisted on having the pups from this litter in the house , where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes sense that early and constant association with kind and affectionate humans would develop a more complete acceptance and trust far more quickly than kennel contact would . It follows that these pups would take direction more easily and start earlier because their trust had not been violated and they had no reason to fear . And taking direction well certainly makes a faster learner . Trusting pups pay attention more naturally , and in the process become superior hunters at an earlier age . In some ways it reminds me of how my home-schooled grandson 's mind was carefully , kindly challenged . Today , at 20 , he has a master 's degree in microbiology . I saw Shaffer 's " home-schooled " litter when the pups had become too big to live together in the house and had been moved to the kennel . Shaffer opened the kennel , walked out on the lawn and clapped his hands , and all the dogs came running to their pack leader . He led them to a dead tree where he had placed a caged coon , pretended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bark and had his Walkers and some clients ' pups enthusiastically barking treed . Earlier , their treeing instincts had been awakened by the example of an experienced hound . The next step would be running free in Shaffer 's 100-acre enclosure to tree squirrels with a trained dog . Once started , they 'd hunt by themselves to develop self-reliance  --  two at a time , if possible , since they 're bolder in a pack . Finally , the squirrel process would be repeated on coons at night  --  starting with raccoons eating at a feeder in an 11-acre enclosure and finishing in the large enclosure . If you do n't have ideal training grounds ( where young hounds can find a coon every time out ) , call Shaffer at 304-965-6824 . Our Biggest Mistakes 1 We take a pup hunting without first introducing it to trailing and treeing in the woods with a caged coon . 2 Without any game introduction , the confused pup hangs around us , so we " whip it away from the light , " shouting , " Get out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods . 3 We hope our old hounds will do the training for us . Truth is , the dumbest pup is a genius at copying all of an old dog 's faults . Furthermore , unless we leave that old dog at home at least once every three or four hunts , the pup never gains the independence needed to become a top-notch coonhound .
