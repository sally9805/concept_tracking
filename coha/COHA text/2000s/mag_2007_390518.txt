Headnote Exploring the delicate and explosive mother-daughter relationship . The five years I recentiy spent researching and writing a book about mothers and daughters also turned out to be the last years of my mother 's life . In her late 80s and early 90s , she gradually weakened , and I spent more time with her , caring for her more intimately than I ever had before . This experience-together with her death before I finished writing-transformed my thinking about mother-daughter relationships and the book that ultimately emerged . All along I had in mind die questions a journalist had asked during an interview about my research . " What is it about mothers and daughters ? " she blurted out . " Why are our conversations so complicated , our relationships so fraught ? " These questions became more urgent and more personal , as I asked myself : What had made my relationship with my mother so volatile ? Why had I often ricocheted between extremes of love and anger ? And what had made it possible for my love to swell and my anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though much of what I discovered about mothers and daughters is also true of mothers and sons , fathers and daughters , and fathers and sons , diere is a special intensity to the mother-daughter relationship because talk-particularly talk about personal topics-plays a larger and more complex role in girls ' and women 's social lives than In boys ' and men 's . For girls and women , talk is the glue that holds a relationship together-and the explosive diat can blow it apart . That 's why you can think you 're having a perfectly amiable chat , dien suddenly find yourself wounded by the shrapnel from an exploded conversation . Daughters often object to remarks diat would seem harmless to outsiders , like this one described by a student of mine , Katiiryn Ann Harrison : " Are you going to quarter diose tomatoes ? " her mother asked as Katiiryn was preparing a salad . Stiffening , Katiiryn replied , " Well , I was . Is that wrong ? " " No , no , " her mother replied . " It 's just that personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fine . " But as she sliced the tomatoes , she thought , Ca n't I do anything without my mother letting me know she thinks I should do it some other way ? I 'm willing to wager that Kathryn 's mother thought she had merely asked a question about a tomato . But Kathryn bristled because she heard the implication , " You do n't know what you 're doing . I know better . " I 'm a linguist . I study how people talk to each other , and how the ways we talk affect our relationships . My books are filled witti examples of conversations diat I record or recall or that others record for me or report to me . For each example , I begin by explaining die perspective that I understand immediately because I share it : in mother-daughter talk , the daughter 's , because I 'm a daughter but not a mother . Then I figure out the logic of the other 's perspective . Writing this book forced me to look at conversations from my mother 's point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geographic , racial and cultural backgrounds , and I had informal conversations or e-mail exchanges witi countless others . The complaint I heard most often from daughters was , " My modier is always criticizing me . " The corresponding complaint from mothers was , " I ca n't open my mouth . She takes everything as criticism . " Both are right , but each sees only her perspective . One daughter said , for example , " My modier 's eyesight is falling , but she can still spot a pimple from across the room . " Her modier does n't realize that her comments-and her scrutiny-make the pimple bigger . Mothers subject their daughters to a level of scrutiny people usually reserve for themselves . A motiier 's gaze is like a magnifying glass held between die sun 's rays and kindling . It concentrates the rays of imperfection on her daughter 's yearning for approval . The result can be a conflagration-whoosh . This I knew : Because a mother 's opinion matters so much , she has enormous power . Her smallest comment-or no comment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequenty anger . But this I learned : Mothers , who have spent decades watching out for tiieir children , often persist in commenting because they ca n't get their adult children to do what is ( diey believe ) obviously right . Where die daughter sees power , the mother feels powerless . Daughters and mothers , I found , both overestimate the otiier 's power-and underestimate their own . The power that mothers and daughters hold over each otiier derives , in part , from their closeness . Every relationship requires a search for the right balance of closeness and distance , but the struggle Is especially Intense between mothers and daughters . Just about every woman I spoke to used the word " close , " as In " We 're very close " or " We 're not as close as I 'd like ( or she 'd like ) to be . " In addition to the closeness/distance yardstick-and inextricable from it-is a yardstick that measures sameness and difference . Mothers and daughters search for themselves in the other as If hunting for treasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be pleasant : After her mother 's death , one woman noticed that she wipes down the sink , cuts an onion and holds a knife just as her mother used to do . She found this comforting because it meant her mother was stlU with her . Sameness , however , can also make us cringe . One mother thought she was being particularly supportive when she assured her daughter , " I know what you mean , " and described a matching experience of her own . But one day her daughter cut her off : " Stop saying you know because you 've had the same experience . You do n't know . This is my experience . The world is different now . " She felt her mother was denying the uniqueness of her experience-offering too much sameness . " I sound just like my mother " is usually said with distaste-as is the wry observation , " Mirror mirror on the wall , I am my mother after all . " When visiting my parents a few years ago , I was sitting across from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hair long ? " I laughed , and she asked what was funny . I explained that in my research , I had come across many examples of mothers who criticize their daughters ' hair . " I was n't criticizing , " she said , looking hurt . I let the matter drop . A little later , I asked , " Mom , what do you think of my hair ? " Without hesitation , she said , " I think it 's a little too long . " Hair is one of what I call the Big Three that mothers and daughters critique ( the other two are clothing and weight ) . Many women I talked to . on hearing the topic of my book , Immediately retrieved offending remarks that they had archived , such as , Tm so glad you 're not wearing your hair in that frumpy way anymore " : another had asked , " You did that to your hair on purpose ? " Yet another told her daughter , after seeing her on television at an important presidential event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk up to a stranger and say , " I think you 'd look better if you got your hair out of your eyes , " but her mother might feel entitled , if not obligated , to say it , knowing that women are judged by appearance-and that mothers are judged by their daughters ' appearance , because daughters represent their mothers to the world . Women must choose hairstyles , like styles of dress , from such a wide range of options , it 's inevitable that others-mothers included-will think their choices could be improved . Ironically , mothers are more likely to notice and mention flaws , and their comments are more likely to wound . But it works both ways . As one mother put it , " My daughters can turn my day black in a millisecond . " For one thing , daughters often treat their mothers more callously than they would anyone else . For example , a daughter Invited her mother to join a dinner party because a guest had bowed out . But when the guest 's plans changed again at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the daughter , her mother was both readily available and expendable . There 's another way that a mother can be a lightning rod in the storm of family emotions . Many mothers told me that they can sense and absorb their daughters ' emotions instantly ( " If she feels down , I feel down " ) and that their daughters can sense theirs . Most told me this to illustrate the closeness they cherish . But daughters sometimes resent the expectation that they have this sixth sense-and act on It . Daughters want their mothers to see and value what they value in themselves ; that 's why a question that would be harmless in one context can be hurtful in another . For example , a woman said that she told her mother of a successful presentation she had made , and her mother asked , " What did you wear ? " The woman exclaimed , in exasperation , " Who cares what I wore ? ! " In fact , the woman cared . She had given a lot of thought to selecting the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the content of her talk-seemed to undercut her professional achievement . Some mothers are ambivalent about their daughters ' success because it creates distance : A daughter may take a path her mother ca n't follow . And mothers can envy daughters who have taken paths their mothers would have liked to take , if given the chance . On the other hand , a mother may seem to devalue her daughter 's choices simply because she does n't understand the life her daughter chose . I think that was the case with my mother and me . My mother visited me shortly after I had taken a teaching position at Georgetown University , and I was eager to show her my new home and new life . She had disapproved of me during my rebellious youth , and had been distraught when my first marriage ended six years before . Now I was a professor ; clearly I had turned out all right . I was sure she 'd be proud of me-and she was . When I showed her my office with my name on the door and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she asked , " Do you think you would have accomplished all this if you had stayed married ? " " Absolutely not , " I said . " If I 'd stayed married , I would n't have gone to grad school to get my Ph.D . " " Well , " she replied , " if you 'd stayed married you would n't have had to . " Ouch . With her casual remark , my mother had reduced all I had accomplished to the consolation prize . I have told this story many times , knowing 1 could count on listeners to gasp at this proof that my mother belittled my achievements . But now I think she was simply reflecting the world she had grown up in , where there was one and only one measure by which women were judged successful or pitiable : marriage . She probably did n't know what to make of my life , which was so different from any she could have imagined for herself . I do n't think she intended to denigrate what I had done and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world could not encompass the one I had chosen . Reframing how I look at it takes the sting out of this memory . Reframing is often key to dissipating anger . One woman found that this technique could transform holiday visits from painful to pleasurable . For example , while visiting , she showed her mother a new purchase : two pairs of socks , one black and one navy . The next day she wore one pair , and her mother asked , " Are you sure you 're not wearing one of each color ? " In the past , her mother 's question would have set her off , as she wondered , " What kind of incompetent do you think I am ? " This time she focused on the caring : Who else would worry about the color of her socks ? Looked at this way , the question was touching . If a daughter can recognize that seeming criticism truly expresses concern , a mother can acknowledge that concern truly implies criticism-and bite her tongue . A woman who told me that this worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter announced , " I joined Weight Watchers and already lost two pounds . " In the past , the mother would have said , " That 's great " and added , " You have to keep it up . " This time she replied , " That 's great " - and stopped there . Years ago , I was surprised when my mother told me , after I began a letter to her " Dearest Mom , " that she had waited her whole life to hear me say that . I thought this peculiar to her until a young woman named Rachael sent me copies of e-mails she had received from her mother . In one , her mother responded to Rachael 's effusive Mother 's Day card : " Oh , Rachael ! ! ! ! ! That was so WONDERFUL ! ! ! It almost made me cry . I 've waited 25 years , 3 months and 7 days to hear something like that .... " Helping to care for my mother toward the end of her life , and writing this book at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these parallel reactions . Caring about someone as much as you care about yourself , and the critical eye that comes with it , are two strands that can not be separated . Both engender a passion that makes the mother-daughter relationship perilous-and precious .
