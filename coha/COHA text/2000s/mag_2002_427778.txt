contests Bernie Johnsen , 32 , Denver Web programmer , mountain bike and road racer Bernie won Reader of the Month honors in our September online poll . He raced BMX and motorcycles as a kid , then " When I was about 15 , things like cars and girls took over . About 10 years ago , I bought a used mountain bike and those BMX skills came back ! After a mere three weeks back in the saddle , Bernie entered his first race . YOUR BIG MAINTENANCE PROBLEM ? Squeaks . There 's always a squeak . I want my bikes to run absolutely perfectly , and if there 's a squeak , it becomes a major nightmare for everyone involved , whether it 's my bike squeaking or someone else 's . I rode early technology full suspension bikes in the early ' 90s-all the bushings were brass friction . They worked really well , but they had constant squeaks . It was a squeak nightmare . " HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN YOURSELF DURING A RIDE ? " If I do n't eat property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getting the right amount of sugar , carbs and water makes all the difference . If you 're not eating properly , you 're not going to get all the potential out of the muscles you 've worked so hard to develop . " I usually drink some kind of sports drink and I like Rice Krispie treats because they have lots of sugar , some relatively complex carbs from the rice and a little bit of fat . So you get a kick right away from the sugar , but you do n't book because they digest relatively slowly . And they 're a lot lighter than energy bars-it still boggles my mind how they got to be such an industry . Unless it 's 80 degrees outside , they 're like chewing on frozen taffy . " THIS GUY WON A SWEET TEAM KIT ! Matthew Glockner of Ypsilanti , MI , won a team kit from Lotto-Adecco . Matthew , a 29-year-old Army civil servant , was searching for a used bike for his girlfriend , Laura , but decided it would be easier to win himself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , it worked . Matthew won a bike from BICYCLING.com-and not just any old bike , mind you , but a tricked-out team-issue Pinarello Surprise-and bagged a team kit , including a Lotto-Adecco jersey and shorts , Carnac shoes and a Giro helmet . The best part ? Now he can ride with his squeeze . WHAT MADE YOU ENTER ? " I was checking the Tour de France coverage and I realized if I won , I 'd have two great bikes . and Laura could ride one , as we 're almost the same height and size . It 's a gear-intensive sport , so it 's fantastic to be able to introduce someone to it so cheaply . I get the first few months on the Pinarello , though . " WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU WON ? " I got an e-mail . and I thought it was a gag . So I went to the Web site and saw my name . Then I called Laura , and she did n't believe me . " HOW 'S THE STUFF ? " The shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I wore them , I found my legs going faster than my lungs wanted to go . It sounds corny , but I felt faster wearing the clothes . " SHOES ? " Insoles are usually just cheap pieces of foam , but these feel molded to my foot-they 're sculpted to fit and very comfy . " HOW ABOUT THE HELMET ? " It feels no heavier than a cycling cap . Jt 's very comfortable and well ventilated . " VOTE ! CHOOSE THE NEXT READER OF THE MONTH Read the full interviews-and vote for your favorite-at BICYCLING.com .

I sit and dream about the fun I 'm going to have on it . Lately it 's a road bike . My friends ride them , and they seem to have fun . WHAT 'S YOUR FAVORITE CYCLING SOUND ? The sounds my dog makes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , her collar jingles , dirt and rocks kick up as she flies down the trail .

When the bike 's in motion and there 's no pedaling . The purring noise is epic ! WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE WINTER ? I swim , run and hike-anything that 's not cycling so I do n't get burned out , but I try to attend Spin classes every week . Whit Morison , 38 Customer service rep , Bristol , VA ; road SHAVED LEGS ON MEN ? I have n't yet . I 've got a friend who says the first time I crash and have road rash I 'll shave them .
