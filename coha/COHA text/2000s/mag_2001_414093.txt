Dear Dr. Cory : What causes strep throat ? Ksd Castol and Tierra Dinkins Hutchens Elementary School Mobile , Alabama Dear Kateland and Tierra : Strep throat is caused by Group A streptococci ( STREP-toe-cock-sigh ) bacteria . Most strep throat infections are passed from person to person on droplets of moisture as people breathe . A person with a strep infection is often " contagious " before he notices any symptoms-one more reason to cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough and to have good hand-washing habits . Not everyone who has a sore throat has strep throat . Many sore throats are caused by viruses . Throat cultures show if the sore throat is caused by a bacteria . If it is , then antibiotics will fight the bacteria and cure the infection .

Dear Dr. Cory : I am planning to build up muscle for athletics . I am thirteen and weigh 74 pounds . How can I do this In a healthy way ? Walter Foxworth Dallas , Texas Dear Walter : We would suggest that you look at programs at your school , community center , or health club offering strengthtraining classes that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledgeable about appropriate training for your age and stage of physical development . The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) defines strength-training as the use of a variety of methods , including exercises with free weights and weight machines , to increase muscular strength , endurance , and/or power for sports participation or fitness enhancement . Repetition and proper technique should be the focus rather than the amount of weight lifted . Power lifting should be avoided . Using lighter weights and lifting them at a slow speed forces the muscles you are using to fully contract through their full range of motion . You are also less likely to injure yourself this way . Strength-training should not be confused with the sports of weight lifting , power lifting , and body building . According to the AAP , until your body has reached full adult development ( usually between the ages of fifteen and eighteen ) you should avoid the sport of weight lifting , power lifting and body building , as well as the repetitive use of maximal amounts of weight in strengthtraining programs , because these sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Your friend , Cory SerVaas , M.D. Antibiotic medicine will not work on viruses . They are only effective against bacteria . Unnecessary and improper use of antibiotics can lead to bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics . This means that the antibiotic will no longer be able to fight the bacteria to get rid of the infection . This is something health care professionals are trying hard to prevent by educating everyone about the appropriate use of antibiotics . You can do your part by remembering to take your antibiotic medicine for the full number of days that have been prescribed for you . Some people think they can stop taking an antibiotic when they start to feel better , but this just gives the bacteria a chance to become stronger and resistant to the antibiotic .
