<p> Newly released results from metro area school systems on state standardized tests taken this spring show a wide disparity in the way students are performing . <p> In several systems , students had relatively few problems with the high-stakes tests . In Fulton , Cobb and Gwinnett counties , for instance , less than 20 percent of eighth graders tested failed the all-important math and reading exams . <p> But , in Atlanta , Clayton and DeKalb school systems , more than a third of eighth-graders might remain in middle school because they failed , according to preliminary state data . <p> Statewide , 23 percent of Georgia 's eighth-graders failed math , and 11 percent failed reading , according to data The Atlanta Journal-Constitution obtained from the state Department of Education . <p> The students can take the test again before schools reopen in August . But the high failure rates mean several thousand metro students will attend summer school in hopes of joining their class in high school . <p> This year , for the first time , eighth-graders had to pass the math and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to high school . <p> Preliminary school system results obtained using the state 's Open Records Act show a wide range of performance among large metro systems . <p> In Cherokee County , the system was " extremely pleased " with its showing this year , said spokesman Mike McGowan . Only 4 percent of Cherokee 's eighth-graders failed the reading exam . And about 12 percent failed math . <p> The system put more focus on reading and math in the grades where promotion hinges on students passing the state exam , he said . " Hopefully , the numbers will be even higher next year , " he said . <p> Although requested by the newspaper , the state did not release a breakdown by race , ethnicity or other demographics , including family income . All these factors can influence scores on standardized tests . <p> And the school systems where students struggled on the reading and math sections tend to have the greatest student poverty and proportion of black or Hispanic students . <p> In Atlanta , for example , 71 percent of students are from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third of its students living in poverty , according to state data on free and reduced lunch participation . <p> Although not available by system , the statewide data shows African-American and Hispanic students had more trouble passing the standardized exams than white or Asian students . Among eighth-graders , for example , 93 percent of Asian students and 87 percent of white students passed the math exam , compared with 66 percent of African-American students and 68 percent of Hispanic students . <p> Test scores were most depressed in systems where poor or minority students make up most of the enrollment . <p> In the Atlanta city schools , 40 percent of the eighth-graders failed the math portion of the exam , known as the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests . Twenty-two percent of Atlanta 's eighth-graders failed the reading exam . <p> Lester McKee , the system 's director of research , planning and accountability , noted that a 40-percent failure rate was an improvement in student math scores ; 51 percent of eighth-graders failed the math test last year , while 48 percent failed in 2004 . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time incrementally improve performance at all grade levels , " McKee wrote in an e-mail . " We see evidence that our programs are working not only in math but across the vast majority of our tested subject areas . " He cautioned against comparing this year 's reading scores to students ' 2005 results . He noted that this year 's test is based on a new curriculum that is more rigorous and " set(s) the bar higher by requiring students to answer more questions correctly to pass the test . " <p> In DeKalb , the state 's third-largest school system , 36 percent of the eighth-graders failed the math test and 15 percent failed reading . In that system alone , nearly 3,000 of the nearly 8,000 students who were tested may be held back from high school if they ca n't pass the retest . <p> Despite the high failure rates , the numbers have improved from earlier years in other systems as well . <p> In Clayton County , for example , 34 percent of the eighth-graders failed the math test this spring . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DeKalb County system did not respond to requests for comment . <p> A Clayton County spokesman emphasized the improvements in eighth-grade scores , and efforts to provide more after-school help . " It should be noted that the status in which Clayton County finds itself did not happen one or two years ago , " said Charles White , the system spokesman , in an e-mail message . <p> " Increasing the number of students experiencing success takes time  --  and we are seeing gains . " <p> The tests are taken by elementary and middle school students and cover several basic subjects  --  language arts , reading , math , science and social studies . The state introduced the curriculum exam in 2000 , and legislators attached high-stakes repercussions to it soon after . <p> The idea was to stop the practice of " social promotion , " in which students are pushed on to the next grade , regardless of whether they are prepared for higher-level work . <p> Two years ago , third graders had to pass the reading test to move up to the fourth grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth graders , who must pass both the reading and math exams . <p> For many parents , the news of a child 's failure was a disappointment , if not a shock . <p> Monica Aldridge has two children attending summer school this year , including 8-year-old Gabriel , who missed the reading test for third graders by two points . <p> Aldridge was sympathetic , to a point . She understands that her son may not test well , and based on sample questions , she thinks the test was hard . But she places the responsibility to pass the exam on his shoulders . <p> " He could have passed , " she said . " I try to tell him , basically , it 's survival for the future  --  education . " <p> The promotion rule does include some flexibility . A student can move ahead to the next grade , despite failing the retest , if the parent , principal and teacher agree . And in many systems , officials say the summer school and retest seem to do the trick . <p> In Cherokee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third and fifth graders who had failed the exams on the first try , passed on a second attempt after summer school , McGowan said . <p> GEORGIA CRITERION-REFERENCED COMPETENCY TESTS <p> The Georgia Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests are administered each spring to elementary and middle school students . The tests are designed to address whether students mastered what they were taught based on the state curriculum , so they are good to use for looking at school accountability . Not all grades take all five exams . Data shown are the percentages of students who took the test but failed to meet minimum standards . <p> ENGLISH/LANGUAGE ARTS <p> System name ... Grade 3 ...

Included are preliminary data for all students tested in 2006 as well as historical data for comparison purposes . Because of test contract issues , only students in grades 4 , 6 and 8 were tested in 2003 . To protect the privacy of individual students , the newspaper has voluntarily withheld data where fewer than 10 students were tested in any given category .
