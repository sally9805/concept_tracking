In Russia 's first years as a market economy , crooks and businessmen were one and the same . But Mikhail Khodorkovsky , 40 , the richest man in Russia , was a self-imposed reform movement . His Yukos Oil Co. enjoys a reputation among foreign investors as perhaps the most Western-like company in Russia . It has a cluster of Americans on its board ; among top management , it uses U.S. accounting standards ; and it was the first Russian company to detail its precise ownership structure . Yukos has been talking with both ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco about the possible sale to one of them of as much as 40% of its equity , according to people familiar with the negotiations . <P> But when Khodorkovsky was arrested last week on tax evasion and other charges , following months of intimidation , alarm bells went off in Russia and around the world . Prosecutors froze a 44% stake in Yukos , the world 's fourth largest oil company and the source of Khodorkovsky 's wealth , estimated last year at $8 billion . Khodorkovsky denies any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political . <P> The arrest could damage international confidence in the Russian economy , which had been rebounding nicely from its slump in the late 1990s . The prospect of Yukos being forcibly renationalized sent the Moscow stock market , which has performed strongly this year , down 10% in one of its biggest one-day declines since the debt crisis of 1998 . <P> Many in Russia view the arrest as the centerpiece of a power struggle between " the Siloviki , " as President Vladimir Putin 's coterie of security officials and bureaucrats is known , and " the Family , " the billionaire oligarchs and top officials who thrived during the wild days of privatization under former President Boris Yeltsin . Putin is a former KGB operative , Khodorkovsky a former Young Communist League official , a platform from which he launched his business empire . <P> The crisis even split Putin 's inner circle . His chief of staff resigned , and Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov defied an order to stay out of the affair , saying he was " deeply concerned . " <P> Khodorkovsky 's real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several opposition parties , a move widely viewed as setting himself up as a future presidential challenger . That apparently rankled Putin , whose deal with the oligarchs is blunt : You stay out of national politics ; I 'll let you be . Two other tycoons who tangled with him , Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky , have fled into exile . <P> Putin insists the Khodorkovsky case is about rooting out corporate corruption and does n't herald any shift in the Kremlin 's pro-business stance , a view he reinforced at a meeting last week with Western bankers . ( Putin was on hand at the opening of the Russian-owned Lukoil 's first U.S. gas station , in September , in Manhattan . ) For the moment , big foreign players are giving him the benefit of the doubt . " We have n't changed our long-term perspective , " says Peter Elam Hakansson , who manages a $250 million Russian-stock fund out of Stockholm for East Capital . " It 's still one of the most exciting places to invest your money . " And how .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
