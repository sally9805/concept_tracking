OCCUPATION Advertising executive who creates Spanish-language ad campaigns <P> GOAL To help mainstream companies reach out to the Hispanic audience <P> QUOTE " This culture has been beaten up and not given the admiration it deserves . I like bringing the spotlight to it . " <P> Her first client was Columbia Pictures , which was trying to figure out a way to market La Bamba , its 1987 movie about rock star Ritchie Valens , to the Latino audience . That same year she won a Clio Award  --  the first ever given to a Spanish-language ad  --  for a Mountain Bell commercial . Now , as head of her own agency based in Santa Monica , Calif. , with clients as diverse as Wells Fargo Bank and the Carl 's Jr . hamburger chain , Anita Santiago is the most prominent ad executive in a hot niche . Latinos spend $300 billion annually , an amount that will double in the next five years .

" <P> The New Jersey-born Santiago , 46 , was raised in Cuba and Venezuela by an American father and a Spanish mother , so " I really understand this market , " she says . Her ads frequently stress family values , important to Latinos . A campaign for the California milk board features families enjoying milk recipes ; another for Wells Fargo shows a grandfather telling a baby why he trusts the bank . With $16 million in billings last year , her agency is profitable and growing . " We do n't want to be the biggest Hispanic agency , " she says . " We want to be the best .
