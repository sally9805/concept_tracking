<p> " Tell the public about the boys . They 're the ones that do the work and they should get the credit . The people are interested in them , not me . " <p> Legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne , to the school 's publicist <p>  --  Notre Dame Coach Charlie Weis was rarely in the spotlight during his 15 seasons as an NFL assistant under coaches Bill Parcells and Bill Belichick , remaining in the background while his teams won four Super Bowl championships . Parcells and Belichick seldom allowed their assistants to speak to the media , instead adhering to a strict " one-voice " policy , and Weis seemed more content designing offenses and dissecting game film than talking to reporters . <p> Even now , as Weis has returned Notre Dame to national prominence in his first season and made the No. 7 Fighting Irish relevant again in college football , the sometimes gruff New Jersey native has chosen to remain in the background , deflecting attention to his players , even though he holds what many would say is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , I could go make myself look like the second coming , " Weis said earlier this week , while talking to a reporter after his team practiced on a cool , crisp evening . " But that 's really being a horse 's behind when you do that . My whole deal coming from the New England Patriots was selling how a team won all those games and Super Bowls . Well , how hypocritical would I be if I 'm talking about how the team was more important than the individual , but then I 'm out there talking to every Tom , Dick and Harry about the job I 've done ? " <p> When Notre Dame was considered the premier college football program in the country , when the Fighting Irish were winning 11 national championships and producing more all-Americans and Heisman Trophy winners than any other school , the coaches often went from average men to national celebrities . It even turned Gerry Faust , a Cincinnati high school football coach before Notre Dame hired him in 1981 , into a household name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash in a Kansas cornfield , he was so revered during the Roaring Twenties that he was often mentioned in the same breath with boxing world champion Jack Dempsey and New York Yankees slugger Babe Ruth . Notre Dame coaches Frank Leahy and Ara Parseghian appeared on the cover of Time magazine , a spot usually reserved for world and national leaders . Former coach Lou Holtz , who led the Fighting Irish to their first national championship in 11 seasons in 1988 , became so popular that he still commands tens of thousands of dollars to make motivational speeches to corporations and other groups . Even the nondescript Bob Davie , who failed to match Holtz 's success in five seasons as his successor , became a network analyst after Notre Dame fired him . <p> " If you 're the coach at Notre Dame , you 're going to be the man , that 's just the way it is , " said former Fighting Irish wide receiver Tim Brown , the 1987 Heisman Trophy winner and longtime NFL player . <p> But Weis , who has guided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Navy at Notre Dame Stadium , says he wants none of the fame that comes with the position . Aside from his weekly news conference , Weis has rarely done TV interviews , even turning away reporters from NBC , which pays Notre Dame $9 million per season to televise its home games . <p> " I 'm not going to talk about me , " Weis said . " I 'll talk about my family . I 'll talk about my special-needs daughter . I 'll talk about those things , things that are important to me . But what I 'm not going to do is talk about myself . " <p> Weis is willing to talk about his family or his foundation , Hannah and Friends , which he and his wife , Maura , started to aid children with autism and global delay . Their 10-year-old daughter , Hannah , has been affected by developmental diseases after she was born with kidney problems . <p> But ask Weis about himself , the coach who was lauded for his brilliant play-calling while the Patriots won three Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment . A 1978 graduate of Notre Dame , a relatively small , Catholic university in northern Indiana and blanketed in several feet of snow for most of the winter , Weis said the Fighting Irish do n't need a salesman . <p> " Other than his foundation and his daughter , Charlie has not been willing to go on TV and talk about himself , " said senior associate athletic director John Heisler , who handles Weis 's media requests . " He 's made it pretty clear from August until January , we 're going to deal with football here . And , when it comes to the football part of it , he says , ' Hey , come talk to our players . Not me . ' He 's been pretty consistent about it . It does n't matter who has televised our games . " <p> Weis believes staying away out of the public eye has helped him earn his players ' respect . Even though Weis occupies the biggest office in Notre Dame 's new Guglielmino Athletics Complex and draws the biggest paycheck  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pay him between $30 million and $40 million , making him the highest-paid coach in college football  --  he adheres to the belief that no individual is bigger than the team . <p> " They know you 're one of the boys , " Weis said . " I 'm not one of those guys that sits up in the tower watching practice . I 'm calling the plays on offense and , during individual drills , I go watch the defense . I 'm always around , so I 'm not trying to be holier than though . " <p> Weis believes the most important part of Notre Dame football is its storied tradition , which he felt had been neglected for too long . Weis invited Brown and former Fighting Irish players Joe Montana , Joe Theismann and Chris Zorich to serve as honorary captains during the team 's spring game , and then had nearly 50 lettermen on the sideline when Notre Dame nearly upset two-time defending national champion Southern California before losing , 34-31 , on Oct. 15 . <p> " I think bringing back all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regenerate the magic of the place , " Notre Dame Athletic Director Kevin White said . " This really is a magical place . When all of those former players are at the games , prospects can see it , smell it and taste it . " <p> Brown said the new coach 's efforts have gone a long way in repairing relations between the university and many of its former players . <p> " One of the problems with the University of Notre Dame is that it 's Notre Dame and it 's kind of a self-fulfilling beast , " Brown said . " They do n't feel like they need the alumni and lettermen back to help them recruit . Charlie just said this is what we 're going to do and here 's how we 're going to do it . Being able to go back there and being invited to nearly every home game , that means a lot . . . . There were some things about that program that I thought no one could fix and they 're not all fixed now , but Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't sure where the Fighting Irish will go this season  --  they 'll probably receive a Bowl Championship Series at-large berth if they win their last three games against Navy , Syracuse and Stanford . But Weis , who watched Notre Dame win the 1977 national championship during his senior year , knows where the Irish have been . <p> " That 's when Notre Dame was Notre Dame , " Weis said . " Coming in here , it was important for me to get everyone to understand what it was . The only what it was I knew was what it was when I was here  --  you were at the top of the world . "
