<p> ABOARD THE NORWEGIAN SEA  --  The waiter glides towards us from across the pool deck , a broad grin on his face . In his hand is a tray full of colorful concoctions . <p> " Pina colada ? Mai tai ? Bahama Mama ? " <p> Miguelito , as his nametag reads , urges us to grab one . And like dozens of other pasty-faced tourists escaping the snowy north , we happily oblige . The ship is setting sail , and the bon voyage party is about to begin . <p> " Just one moment , " he says , reaching into his back pocket as we turn toward a calypso band warming up by the pool . " Sign here . " <p> Cha-ching . <p> Miguelito had failed to mention there 'd be a charge for the umbrella-topped confections . But now that straws are at our lips , he 's quick to brandish a bill . The bon voyage entertainment may be free , but not the drinks . Not by a long shot . They 're almost $ 7 apiece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as enticing as the last-minute deals offered by cruise lines these days . With travel in the doldrums and lines struggling to fill dozens of new ships , the cost of a cabin has been sinking as fast as the Titanic . But the bargain-basement voyages seen in advertisements for as little as $ 169 a weekend and $ 399 a week are n't quite as inexpensive as they seem . <p> Even as the base prices for cruises have plummeted in recent years , cruise lines have made up for the revenue shortfall by charging ever more for onboard extras such as drinks , shipboard photography and spa services . They also have begun charging for meals in some shipboard restaurants  --  once considered heresy in a business built on selling " all-inclusive " vacations . And they have assigned steep price tags to shipboard activities such as miniature golf , ice skating and rock climbing . <p> " Cruising is no longer the all-inclusive vacation that it once was promoted as being , " says Mike Driscoll , editor of Cruise Week , an industry newsletter . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they 've been in 20 years , and judging from the upfront sticker price , that would seem to be true . But it 's just not the case , because you spend more on board . " <p> Industry watchers warn that extra charges can add hundreds of dollars a day to the typical cruise bill . Just how many hundreds ? We set out to find out . We booked one of the cheapest cruises in the Caribbean : a five-night romp aboard the aging Norwegian Sea advertised for just $ 269 ( a person ) . Then we climbed on board to find out what it really cost , once taxes , fees , tips and other onboard expenses are tacked onto the bill . <p> The final tally ( for two ) : $ 1,367.67  --  five times the advertised amount . <p> " The spa , the casino , the shore excursions  --  those are the places where they really make their money now , " says Driscoll , noting that the upfront charge seen in advertisements is representing a smaller and smaller percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent $ 176 alone to book a single shore excursion for two  --  a 45-minute ride on the Atlantis submarine in Cozumel , Mexico . And its cost was n't atypical . Aboard the Sea , 18 of the 26 shore trips offered at the two ports of call , Cozumel and Grand Cayman Island , cost $ 50 a person or more . Five cost more than $ 100 . <p> Our wallet also took a hit from the $ 10 per-person , per-day " service charge " Norwegian began adding to bills two years ago ( until recently , most lines left tipping up to passenger discretion ) . <p> And then there are those drinks . Cocktails run as high as $ 9.20 , including the 15% tip added to bills " for your convenience . " Coke is $ 1.73 . And waiters , it seems , are on a mission to sell as many as they can . Their incessant cries of " bar service " provide a never-ending chorus on the pool deck . <p> For the first-timers on board , it does n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cabin is just the start of their spending . <p> " It 's the little things you do n't think about that get you , " says Niana Hill , an Atlanta native lounging by the pool . " I 'll have at least one or two pina coladas per day , and we have a bottle of wine with dinner . It sure adds up . " <p> Hill and her husband paid $ 1,100 for their cruise . But two days into the voyage , they 've already racked up another $ 449 in charges . A printout they pulled at the credit desk showed levies for everything from shore excursions booked shortly after boarding to Internet access to the ship 's $ 10-a-head French restaurant . <p> " I looked at the bill and I was , like , ' Holy moly ! ' " she says . <p> Lots to do  --  at a cost <p> Like other lines , Norwegian 's brochures boast about the bevy of onboard activities . " You 'll never be bored " is the new cruise-industry mantra . Alas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come at a cost , and there 's plenty of not-so-subtle pressure to pay up for them . <p> The Freestyle Daily , a newsletter slipped under passenger doors , is chock-full of plugs for $ 10-a-head casino tournaments , " gala champagne " art auctions , " 40% off " emerald sales in the gift shop and myriad other ways to empty one 's wallet . The TVs in cabins play a round-the-clock rundown of shore excursions for sale . <p> Norwegian also has been rolling out all sorts of new onboard profit centers to boost spending . The Sea 's 75-cents-a-minute Internet Cafe is just 3 years old , retrofitted into a hallway . A $ 3-a-bar ice cream stand recently was plunked down in the middle of the pool deck . And Le Bistro , the $ 10-a-head French eatery , also is new . <p> And then there 's the spa . Older ships such as the Sea lack the palaces of pampering being built into newer models . But that does n't stop the eager staff from touting treatments costing as much as $ 280 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daily , we limited ourselves to a single treatment , a 55-minute facial that cost $ 111.55  --  two bucks a minute . But many cruisers spend far more . " Once you 're in the spa , they really sell you up , " Driscoll says . " You can easily spend $ 200 a visit . " <p> Still , few passengers are complaining . Even with all the extra charges , many argue that the vacation is still a heck of a deal . <p> " With the base price so low , you can afford to splurge a bit on extras , " says Brian Harris , a radiologist from Hummelstown , Pa . <p> Reviewing his spending on a ferry ride in Cozumel , Harris notes that he and his wife booked the best cabin on the ship , the owner 's suite , for just $ 2,100 , including airfare from Pennsylvania . " At a resort on land you 'd pay $ 200 a night just for the room . Here you get all your meals , too . " <p> So how good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does seem the epitome of a last-minute bargain . Booking on Expedia.com just eight days before departure , we had snagged a category " ff " oceanview cabin listed in the brochure for $ 1,009 per person . Our rate , $ 269 , represents a 73% discount and works out to just $ 54 a night . <p> But that price , of course , is " per person , based on double occupancy . " And that means the base cost of the cabin really is twice as high , or $ 108 a night . Add in the extras and the final tally for two swells to $ 280 a night . Not bad , perhaps , considering that includes meals and shows , but a bargain ? <p> Passengers on board say it depends on what you expect for $ 280 a night . Our cabin , No. 3049 , is far from fancy . Located low in the ship toward the back , it vibrates from the engines , which throb loud enough to keep a light sleeper up . The sheets are thin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a typical motel room . <p> This is a mass-market cruise in every sense . Masses of people . Mass-produced food served up by a harried staff . Mass-produced entertainment . Unlike Norwegian 's newest ships , as dazzling as any afloat , the 15-year-old Sea 's public areas are cramped and crowded . <p> Still , compared with Caribbean resorts of similar quality on land , it 's a good value , says Kevin Steward , 38 , of Circleville , Ohio . " Where else can you get five days in the Caribbean for just $ 500 a person ? " <p> You can cut corners <p> Veteran cruisers on the ship , moreover , say they have learned ways to keep onboard spending down . Carolyn Smith , 46 , of Leesburg , Va. , never books shore activities through the line . When the ship docked in Grand Cayman , she and some friends found a taxi to take them to famed Seven Mile Beach for $ 4 a person . Other friends signed up for Norwegian 's " Seven Mile Beach Getaway , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the same beach as us , except they got there an hour later , " she notes . " They were n't happy . " <p> Richard Terpolilli , 58 , of Stuart , Fla. , admits to sneaking a bottle of scotch aboard in a suitcase so he and his wife could celebrate cocktail hour in their cabin  --  a move that saved a lot in drink charges . <p> Another way to save is to just say no to onboard extras . Norwegian spokeswoman Susan Robison notes that even the automatically added service charge can be removed from bills if passengers so choose . And such extras as the Internet were added as a convenience . " A guest can choose not to use it . " Still , for many , sailing for days without spending a dime is a challenge . <p> " Not everyone drinks . Not everyone gambles . But it 's rare to find someone who can spend a week on a ship and not spend money on something , " Driscoll says . <p> As a vacation option , the cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Las Vegas . " They lure you in with cheap rates , then get you when you arrive . " <p> Not exactly all-inclusive <p> How does a cruise advertised for $ 269 end up costing $ 1,368 ? For starters , rates are " per person , based on double occupancy . " So the cabin actually costs $ 538 for two  --  before taxes and fees . Many lines also add a " service charge " to cover tips for the crew . And there are extra charges for most drinks , certain restaurants , use of most services and activities . How the costs added up on our trip for two , with moderate spending for extras : <p> Base cost of cruise <p> Cabin ( $ 269 x 2 ) $ 538.00 <p> Taxes : 113.70 <p> Booking fee : 15.00 <p> Total : $ 666.70 <p> Additional spending on the ship <p> Drinks : $ 130.02 <p> Shore excursions : 176.00 <p> Spa : 111.55 <p> Service charge : 100.00 <p> Alternative dining : 20.00 <p> Photo gallery : 37.40 <p> Total : $ 574.97 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship : $ 48.00 <p> Tips to baggage porters before/after cruise : 10.00 <p> Photo on Atlantis submarine , Cozumel : 10.00 <p> Taxi , Cozumel : 6.00 <p> Island bus tour , Grand Cayman : 40.00 <p> Tickets to Turtle Farm , Grand Cayman : 12.00 <p> Total : $ 126.00 <p> Total cost : $ 1,367.67 <p> Charges on Norwegian Sea <p> Can of Coke : $ 1.50 <p> Can of Budweiser : $ 3.25 <p> Bottle of Perrier : $ 3 <p> Bottle of Cuvaison chardonnay : $ 32 <p> Mai Tai : $ 5.95 <p> Cosmopolitan : $ 8 <p> Haagen-Dazs ice cream bar ( sold poolside ) : $ 3 <p> Dinner at Le Bistro restaurant : $ 10 per person <p> Afternoon wine tasting at Four Seasons restaurant : $ 10 per person <p> " Martini club " martini-making lessons : $ 10 per person <p> Photo , 5x7 : $ 10 <p> Photo , 8x10 : $ 20 <p> Phone call to shore : $ 5.95 a minute <p> Internet access : $ 3.95 one-time fee plus $.75 a minute <p> Baby-sitting : $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional ) <p> Massage , 50 minutes : $ 99 <p> Facial , 55 minutes : $ 99 <p> " Oxygen lifting " facial , 55 minutes : $ 117 <p> Body wrap , 55 minutes : $ 115 <p> Ladies ' haircut : $ 60 <p> Men 's haircut : $ 30 <p> Manicure : $ 25 <p> Handmade cigar in Gatsby 's cigar bar : $ 11 <p> Island and beach shore excursion , Cozumel : $ 59 per person <p> Tulum Mayan ruins shore excursion , Cozumel : $ 108 <p> Sea and Island shore excursion , Grand Cayman : $ 50 <p> Deep explorer submarine shore excursion , Grand Cayman : $ 365 <p> Souvenir cruise video : $ 29 to $ 39 , depending on format <p> Entry fee , " Victory at Sea " slot tournament : $ 10 per person <p> Service charge ( added to bills ) : $ 10 per person , per day
