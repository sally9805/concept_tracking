Chapter One Jenna Rawlins really disliked Atlanta 's Regent Street Grill . The restaurant , situated in the upscale suburb of Buckhead , was too sleek , too cold and too uncomfortable . The waiters thought they were doing you a favor by taking your order . And the prices ! Jenna swallowed as her eyes drifted down a dessert menu as thick as a Russian novel . Where did they get the nerve to charge so much ? Of course , she had to admit that Vic was right about one thing . This place was the latest trendy eatery in the city for that important business lunch . Already two of the magazine 's advertising clients had stopped by their table to say hello and buss everyone on the cheek . But honestly , with the small portions they served , what good did it do you to make contacts in the restaurant if you were too weak from hunger to remember their names ? She must have been scowling , because Victoria Estabrook , seated beside her , snatched the menu out of her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Vic commanded . " I do n't want to hear about how the company ca n't afford this right now . This is a celebration , and we 're all having dessert . " They were celebrating the anniversary of Fairy Tale Weddings , the specialty magazine she , Victoria and their friend Lauren Hoffman had founded three years ago . As a CPA and the person who kept the books for the magazine , Jenna knew perfectly well whether the company budget could stand the cost of an expensive lunch for its three partners . It could . Just not too many of them . Vic , however , had been in a contrary mood all through lunch , so it was probably pointless to argue . " I did n't say a word , " Jenna said . " You did n't have to . We can see it on your face . It 's always given you away . " Victoria looked at Lauren , seated across the table . " Am I right ? " Lauren offered an agreeable shrug and sent Jenna an apologetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How do you think we could always tell when things were n't going well with Jack ? " Jenna did n't want to talk about her ex-husband . More than five minutes , and she 'd have a headache for certain . " Be nice , you two , " she warned . " I 'm still trying to get over last night 's argument with Dad . " Victoria tossed down her soiled napkin . " I 'll tell you how to get over it . Tell him that if he wants to continue to have you and his grandsons in his life , there are some opinions he needs to keep to himself . And anything involving Jackass Rawlins , no matter how true , is one of them . " Lauren and Jenna exchanged knowing smiles . This was the kind of advice they could expect from Vic , who 'd been born assertive and who resented anyone trying to tell her how to live . But Jenna was n't like that . She might be a fully grown woman of twenty-eight , but she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . He 'd probably have a coronary right on the spot . Still , it would have been nice to find a better way to handle the " men " in her life . Taking care of two rambunctious young sons , living back home with Dad since her divorce , having two protective older brothers offering more advice than Dear Abby ... The truth was , it could make you nuts . She knew they only wanted the best for her . She knew they all loved her . But ... Was she the world 's worse mother/sister/daughter to sometimes wish she could just pack her bags , hop in the car and never look back ? Probably . Instead of commenting , she watched as Victoria motioned for their waiter , Dexter , who 'd taken their lunch orders once a week for the past six months . He waltzed around several tables to get back to them . " Tell us what 's good today , Dexter , " Victoria demanded . " The mousse is very refreshing , " he suggested brightly . " And easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . " " Six dollars for pudding , " Jenna could n't resist muttering . " Ridiculous . " Victoria shot her an evil look before smiling back up at Dexter . " We 'll all have the Chocolate Sin cake , " she told him . And probably because she felt pricked a little by that " watching your calories " remark , she added , " Make sure they put extra whipped cream on top of mine , darling . " " Of course , " he said smoothly . He knew who to count on for a big tip . Once Dexter left , Lauren leaned across the table . " What 's bothering you , Vic ? " " What makes you think anything 's bothering me ? " " Because besides dessert , you had a fried appetizer , a buttered roll , a salad without the dressing on the side and a dinner-size portion of the lamb . You only overeat when you 're worried or angry about something . So what is it ? " Victoria tossed back the last of her chardonnay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ordered . " It 's Cara , " she said morosely . " She wants to quit school and traipse off to Europe with that moron she 's dating . She 's not listening to me at all . I swear , if I could convince her to come home , I 'd lock her in the attic and toss the key off the top of Stone Mountain . " Jenna laughed . " And I thought I was the only one being tortured by overprotective older siblings . Poor Cara . " " You know I 'm not like that . But after Mom and Dad died , I worked hard to get her future settled . I wo n't let her toss away law school just because this guy gives her multiple orgasms . " Lauren 's brows arched . " Multiple ? Wow . Sounds like someone I 'd like to meet . " " Well , he 's not . He 's crude and ill-mannered and unemployed . Last week he almost talked her into having a nipple pierced . " " Ouch ! " Lauren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prude , but honestly , he 's ... " Victoria made a low , annoyed sound and raked her fingers through her long hair . " Forget him . I refuse to let him spoil our celebration . Now where were we ? " Again Jenna exchanged a glance with Lauren . She was concerned for Vic , but they both knew her well . Vic would n't elaborate further if she did n't want to . There would be another time , another place to tackle the problem of free-spirited baby sister Cara who just would n't listen to reason . Lauren said calmly , " You were telling us about the one who bit the dust . " Victoria turned her attention back to the file folder she 'd set on the table in front of her . She opened it , and Jenna saw that it contained the guts of an article the magazine had run the year before - a fluff piece listing the Ten Most Eligible Bachelors in the South . Lauren had taken the pictures . Victoria had written and edited the text . Jenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader really expected it to help them catch one of these paragons of manhood . But there was n't an unmarried woman in the world who was n't at least curious to know what kind of high-end matrimonial material was out there . That was the heart of Fairy Tale Weddings ' appeal - dreams and fantasies . Besides the latest trends in catering and wedding attire , it specialized in the fantastic . Honeymoon locations that no one else had found and spoiled yet . Weddings that could be performed in mountaintop yurts or underwater on a sunken ship . And though the publication was a pretty small fish in the publishing pond , FTW , as they referred to it , had seemed to find its niche at last . " So which one is getting married ? " Jenna asked , leaning over to get a better look . Truthfully , she was n't all that curious . She might be an equal partner in the magazine , but most of the time she was strictly back office : paying the bills , budgeting and because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each bimonthly issue . Occasionally she helped out in other areas , but the content of FTW was generally left up to Vic . ( Continues ... )
