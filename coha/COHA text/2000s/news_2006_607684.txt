<p> Cornelius Griffin spoke quietly into his cell phone the other day , his wife , Kimberly , on the opposite end of the line . " I 'm at work , baby , " he said . " I 'll be home in three or four hours . Got to watch some film . Got to finish the work . " <p> He drew the blue phone from his ear , pushed a button to hang up , and tucked it onto a shelf in his locker at Redskins Park . He pulled his hand back , but his gaze turned to the three photos he has taped up on the left side of his locker , the pictures of his baby girl Mikalah , just seven months old . Mikalah in a crib , a newborn . Mikalah wearing a smart , checked hat . Mikalah smiling , making her daddy smile right back at her . <p> " That 's my girl , " the Washington Redskins defensive tackle said . " That 's who I have to bring up right . And I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " <p> Work and family , family and work . When Griffin and the Redskins take the field today in Seattle to face the Seahawks in the NFC playoffs , Griffin will be an embodiment of those forces , of work and family , because that is what shaped him from the days he ran across the Little League diamonds in tiny Brundidge , Ala. , the kid who was always bigger than the others . He is 29 now . He stands 6 feet 3 . He weighs 300 pounds . <p> He is one of the Redskins ' most important defensive players , teammates and coaches say , and his presence in the middle of Washington 's defense could go a long way toward determining the outcome of today 's game , because Redskins ' opponents gain 90 fewer yards per game when Griffin is on the field and healthy , getting that push through the opponents ' line . <p> " Just the physical presence he brings makes a huge difference , " said Gregg Williams , the Redskins ' assistant head coach-defense . <p> Griffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " No one knows what you go through . " And it 's possible , even as the Redskins preach togetherness and commitment as they try to win their seventh straight game , that very few of the men who see Griffin at his locker , who see him on the field , who see the way he looks at those pictures of Mikalah  --  very few of them know what he went through that June night in Brundidge , when he came home from church and his daddy was dead . <p> Football ? " What 's football ? " Griffin said . <p> Sure , his teammates know about his other struggles , his injuries , because they watched them happen and then saw the impact on Washington 's defense . Two plays into the Redskins ' worst game of the year , a 36-0 loss to the New York Giants on Oct. 30 , Griffin sustained a painful injury to his hip flexor . He sat out the rest of the Giants game . He did n't play the next three weeks , not in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay and Oakland . He barely played the next week , a crushing overtime loss to San Diego when the Chargers gained 397 yards , the most the Redskins allowed all year . <p> " It was n't the same without him in there , " linebacker Lemar Marshall said . " Cornelius is a crafty veteran . He 's going to get out there and do things because he knows the tricks of the trade . After playing with him for two years , you get a feel for what he 's going to do , and when someone else is in there , maybe they 're not as quick or not as strong , and you react different , and it affects the whole defense . " <p> The statistics argue exactly that . Maybe it 's just coincidence . Maybe Griffin 's absence came in the midst of a defensive swoon and was n't , in fact , a primary cause . But the numbers are stark : In the 12 games , playoff and regular season , in which Griffin has played more than sparingly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five games in which he barely appeared or did not play , they gave up an average of 359 yards . <p> Can one man in 11  --  and , mind you , Griffin is n't a playmaking linebacker or a shut-down cornerback  --  make such a difference ? Yes , said Williams . <p> " Just occupying more than one person , " Williams said . " He 's the kind of person that can take on two people and still win . He has a presence in his pass rush . Sometimes , maybe your defensive tackles are n't maybe some of the solid pass rushers in the league . But we think he 's one of the better pass-rushing defensive tackles around . " <p> Witness his four sacks , a total that places him third on the team behind Marcus Washington , a linebacker , and Phillip Daniels , a defensive end , positions from which sacks are supposed to come . <p> So while Griffin sat out the bulk of those five games , his teammates knew what he was going through because he was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do or what might happen next . " I was encouraging those guys , " he said , and the calls were predictable . Third down ! Step it up ! Get off the field ! Let 's go . <p> But all the while , he was thinking the defensive struggles might have been limited if he had been out there . <p> " Sometimes , " he said , " you do n't know why things happen . " <p> So it was that night in Brundidge , the little burg southeast of Troy , the kind of place that 's small enough that the mayor lists his phone numbers  --  business and home  --  on the town 's Web site . It is there now , where the signs on the way into town say , " Welcome to Brundidge , Home of Cornelius Griffin , No. 96 , Washington Redskins . " <p> It was the late spring of 1998 , the time that was supposed to be the happiest in Griffin 's life . After two years of failing to qualify academically to play Division I-A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , he was finally going to the University of Alabama , finally getting the opportunity to pursue the dream his father , Willie " Buck " Griffin , had always told him he could achieve . Cornelius 's father , known in Brundidge as " Willie Buck " as if the phrase was all one word , " was a workaholic , " said Griffin 's older brother , Willis . He 'd work at a local condiment factory making mayonnaise and mustard from , say , 6 in the morning till 2:30 in the afternoon . He 'd come home and work for eight or 10 more hours as a mechanic at his own business , Griffin 's Garage . Later , he had his own trucking company . <p> " He was just real hard-working people , " said Jimmy Ramage , the mayor of Brundidge . " His word was his bond . Bible Belt . That type of good folk . " <p> " If one of his customers needed something done , he would work till he got it completed , " Willis Griffin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go get them and fix the car and get them going again . He did n't want anyone to be stranded . " <p> Least of all his family . Willie Buck Griffin was also a pastor , and he raised his seven kids in a Pentecostal background that provided simple and powerful guidelines . One of his favorite phrases resonates with the Griffin children now . If things were going a bit astray in school , Willie Buck would say , " Tighten up . " If any of the kids showed signs of not following through on a commitment , they 'd hear it again . " Tighten up , " he 'd say . Willie Buck Griffin never went to college . All of his children did . His three oldest daughters have master 's degrees . His wife , Martha , the mother of his children , is on the verge of completing a degree in psychology at nearby Troy State . <p> " You were taught there 's some things you just do n't do , " Cornelius said . " Your faith has got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One person may give up , but you may not . " <p> On Sunday , June 7 , Willie Buck Griffin preached his sermon at Lily White Church of the Living God . " It was , " Willis Griffin said , " like he preached his own funeral . " Except they could n't know it at that point . The next night , Willis Griffin got a call at 10:40 , maybe 11 p.m . There had been an accident . Come quick . He raced to the site . He saw the police cars . <p> " The first thing , I smelled alcohol , " Willis said , " and I thought , ' I ca n't believe a drunk driver killed my dad . ' " <p> Cornelius Griffin arrived home that night with Kimberly , then his girlfriend , to find a slew of cars near his family 's home . " What 's going on ? " he remembers wondering . <p> The news of Willie Buck 's death spread quickly through the fewer than 2,500 residents of Brundidge . <p> " Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just the type person , you just knew him . He had a radiant personality . He was a real big fella , like Cornelius . He always had a good laugh , and this was just real , real sad . He 's the kind of guy you have in your community , and you never expect him to be gone . " <p> He was gone . Cornelius Griffin , then 21 , was to head to Alabama later in the summer . When he got in the car to begin the drive to Tuscaloosa , he so mourned his father 's death that he turned around , turned back toward Brundidge . And then he heard Willie Buck 's words : " Tighten up . " He pointed the car back toward Tuscaloosa . He was , admittedly , " in a big fog " that first year . But his father 's lessons drove him to complete his career , to develop into a second-round pick of the New York Giants in 2000 . He had five sacks as a rookie , played in the Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30.8 million contract with the Redskins prior to 2004 . <p> Those things  --  sacks , Super Bowls , contracts  --  tend to be the items that define football players . For Griffin , football has been the vocation through which he carries on Willie Buck 's values , even though Willie Buck is n't around . <p> " I definitely think it made me who I am today , " he said of his father 's death . But how ? " Because football 's like life . You quit on a play in football , you might quit on things in life . You got to have great mental toughness to play football . You have got to do the same thing in life . If things are n't going your way , you ca n't feel sorry for yourself . You got to fight to get things turned around . " <p> If Qwest Field gets to rocking this afternoon , if the Seahawks  --  and Griffin 's old teammate at Alabama , NFL MVP Shaun Alexander  --  are moving the ball , there 's a good chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie Buck . They are the words that help him fight through a block , the words that will help him raise little Mikalah . Tighten up .
