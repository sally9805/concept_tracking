Of all the women who endured slavery in this country , only one wrote a book-length account of her life . Her name was Harriet Jacobs , and her autobiography , Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl , has one of the more satisfyingly tart closing lines in American literature . Instead of ending with marriage , she writes , " Reader , my story ends with freedom . " But Jacobs ' story  --  and the lives of other women who had been enslaved  --  did not end with freedom . Nor did their troubles . <P> Harriet Jacobs : A Life ( Basic Civitas Books ; 394 pages ) , by Jean Fagan Yellin , is the first biography of Jacobs , and it 's a harrowing case study of the cruel conundrums women faced under slavery . When Jacobs was an adolescent , her master made sexual advances toward her . She tried to discourage him by initiating an affair with a neighbor .

Her sanctuary was 9 ft. long by 3 ft. high . She stayed there for almost seven years . <P> In 1842 , Jacobs finally escaped to the North . " Sweet and bitter , " she wrote , " were mixed in the cup of my life , and I was thankful that it had ceased to be entirely bitter . " Though few slaves were literate , as a child she had served a sympathetic woman who had tutored her . Jacobs wrote Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl during hours snatched from her duties as a domestic . It became a success on both sides of the Atlantic , and then , according to Yellin , whose book continues where Jacobs ' ends , the ex-slave 's work really began .

Jacobs went over and cooked her dinner . <P> Harriet Tubman was Jacobs ' temperamental opposite , but in many ways their lives ran on parallel tracks . In Catherine Clinton 's Harriet Tubman : The Road to Freedom ( Little , Brown ; 272 pages ) , the first major biography of Tubman in more than 100 years , we see the heroine of children 's books and biopics with a new clarity and richness of detail . Born a slave in Maryland , Tubman made a break for freedom in 1849 , leaving her husband behind . " There was one of two things I had a right to , liberty or death , " she later said . " If I could not have one , I would have the other . " Like Jacobs , she was n't satisfied with just her own freedom .

" When war came , Tubman worked with the Union Army and even led a successful raid up the Combahee River in South Carolina . But Tubman 's battles did not end with the fighting . After the war , on a train back north , the conductor did n't believe a black woman could possibly have been carrying a legitimate military pass . It took four men to drag Tubman out of her seat .
