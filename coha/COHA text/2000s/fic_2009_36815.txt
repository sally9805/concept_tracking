RACHEL CRAWFORD CLOSED HER EYES while the show 's makeup artist , a spunky woman named Carmen , did a quick touch-up . <p> " The sun looks good on you , " Carmen said . " The Diva 's fake ' n bake turns her orange . " <p> " The Diva " was WDXR prime-time anchor Lisa Roberts . Lisa treated the staff like dirt and was easy to hate . Five foot ten with long , skinny legs , Lisa always complained about how much weight the camera added to her figure . Her chair had to be adjusted higher than everyone else 's , the camera always had to be positioned to capture her left side ( exposing a mole on her left cheek that she considered sexy ) , and her water had to be cold with just the right amount of ice . <p> " Maybe my next report will be on tanning beds , " Rachel said . Carmen removed the makeup cape , and Rachel checked herself out in the mirror . <p> She was no Lisa . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Rachel had one thing Lisa didn't-it was the reason for her glow . <p> " I hear tanning beds cause cancer , " Carmen said , perking up with the thought . " Not just skin cancer , either-liver , thyroid , all kinds of nasty stuff . " <p> Rachel did a subtle sideways twist , so casual that Carmen did n't notice . The blouse Rachel wore fit loosely-not so much as to be obvious , but just loose enough . She would have a few more weeks before her secret was out . <p> As a new reporter for the WDXR I-team , Rachel had been working on a piece about the effect of cell phones on pregnant women . In two weeks , she would break her own exciting news on air as part of that piece . For at least one night , Lisa would n't be the center of attention . Tonight , however , she had a very different story to cover . <p> " Thanks , Carmen , " Rachel said . She scooped up her pad and water bottle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too warm , " she said , mocking Lisa 's perfect diction . Carmen cackled . <p> " Plus , it goes straight to my hips , " Carmen shot back , cocking her chin in the air as she gave Rachel a dismissive little shake of the head . <p> Rachel smiled and left the makeup room , settling into investigative reporter mode . Most of tonight 's report was already on tape . Things had gone well during the 5 p.m. newscast . What could possibly go wrong at six ? <p> She loved her job . Yet she loved the thought of being a mother even more . She wanted to do both-part-time I-team reporter and full-time mom . But that was a conversation for another day . <p> * * * <p> Rachel fiddled with her earpiece , listening to the show 's producer give Lisa Roberts and Manuel Sanchez , Lisa 's co-anchor , instructions about the next few segments . Rachel sat up as straight as possible , though she would still be a few inches shorter than Lisa , and smiled at the camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't change her scowl until the man said zero , triggering a magical transformation from spoiled Diva to devoted and caring newswoman . <p> " Over three thousand international college students come to Virginia Beach each summer to work in the resort city , " Lisa said , reading the prompter . " An unlucky few end up being victims of the sinister human trafficking industry . I-team reporter Rachel Crawford has the details . " <p> Lisa held her pose as they transitioned to the I-team tape . She might be hard to stomach , but she was a pro . Lisa 's cover-girl looks and unshakable poise would soon carry her beyond the Norfolk market , away from the place Lisa scornfully referred to as a " dead-end Navy town , " the place Rachel loved and called home . <p> Rachel watched the report for about the fortieth time and allowed herself a brief moment of pride . The segment started with a few shots of The Surf , a popular Virginia Beach hangout , with a voice-over from Rachel about the way international student workers helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern European women tending bar , waiting tables , even taking out the trash . The camera angles had been carefully selected so the viewers could never quite get a good look at the students ' faces . The tape cut to Rachel , standing in front of the bar , a serious tilt to her head . <p> " But a few of these girls , who talked to WDXR under condition of anonymity , said there was a dark side to their summer at the Beach . " <p> The next shot featured Rachel interviewing one of the workers . The editors had blocked out the student 's face and digitally altered her voice . She talked about the owner of The Surf-Larry Jamison-the man who had promised the girls jobs and paid for them to come to America . <p> " If you did n't become one of ' Larry 's girls , ' you could never get out of debt , no matter how hard you worked . Plus , there were threats . " <p> As Rachel explained the scam , a Web site appeared on-screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously a porn site , one that Rachel had traced back to Larry Jamison . <p> " We asked Mr. Jamison about these charges , " Rachel said on the tape . " He refused to be interviewed for this report . " <p> In a few seconds , they would be live again . Rachel checked her earpiece and turned toward Lisa . She heard a pop that startled her-it might have been a few pops-something like firecrackers , coming from the other side of the studio 's soundproof door . She glanced at the doors but nobody else seemed bothered by it . <p> " Five seconds , " said a voice in her ear . " Four , three , two , one ... " <p> A cameraman pointed to Lisa , and she turned toward Rachel . " Those girls you interviewed seemed so vulnerable , " Lisa said . " Did they understand they could press charges against this guy ? " <p> Out of the corner of her eye , Rachel noticed a flash of commotion at the back of the studio . Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls were not willing to come forward . <p> " Hey ! " someone yelled . " He 's got a gun ! " <p> Shots rang out as Rachel swiveled toward the voices , blinded by the bright lights bearing down on her . She heard more shots , screams of panic and pain-pandemonium in the studio . " Get down ! " someone shouted . <p> There was cursing and a third barrage of shots as Rachel dove to the floor , crawling quickly behind the anchor desk-a fancy acrylic fixture that certainly would n't stop a bullet . Overhead , the suspended " on-air " monitor blinked off . In the chaos , Rachel looked over to see Lisa , wide-eyed with fear , her fist to her mouth , shaking with a silent sob . <p> For a moment , everything was still . <p> Chapter Two RACHEL HUDDLED BEHIND THE DESK , paralyzed by fear . Her breath came in short , staccato bursts , miniature explosions into the deafening silence . She pressed both hands against her face , half praying , half listening-shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She gasped when she caught the gunman in her peripheral vision , towering over her-Larry Jamison , the target of her I-team report . The man was wild-eyed , his gray hair disheveled , his face red and stubbled . He pointed a flat black pistol at her that looked like a chopped-off version of a weapon from a Rambo movie . He hit the magazine release and jammed a second magazine into the gun as the first one hit the floor . <p> " You 're the one , " Jamison hissed , grabbing her by the hair and yanking her to her feet . He pressed the barrel into the small of her back . From behind , he wrapped his left arm around her neck and wrenched her close . Rachel could smell sweat and alcohol , his putrid breath moist on her ear . <p> " Everybody at your posts ! " he demanded . " I want this show live in two minutes or this sweet thing dies . " <p> Trembling , Rachel scanned the studio . One of the cameramen , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay next to his camera , blood pooling from his chest . She noticed a young female camera operator hunched in a corner . The control booth had been deserted . She could n't see Lisa and Manuel-they must have crawled to the other side of the anchor desk . <p> " Get back to your camera ! " Jamison shouted at the woman in the corner . He fired several rounds into the wall above her head . Sparks flew and she screamed , scrambling to her station . " Two minutes , " Jamison repeated . " I 'm talking to one of my partners on my Bluetooth right now . He 's waiting for the television signal . " <p> Rachel fought for breath as Jamison squeezed his left arm tighter around her neck , dragging her toward the end of the anchor desk where Lisa and Manuel sat huddled together on the floor . Jamison pointed his gun at Lisa . " Looky here . " <p> He laughed as she stared at him in horror . " Get back behind your desk . We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbing , Lisa stood . She backed slowly away from Jamison , climbing into her anchor seat . <p> " Good girl , " he said . He pointed his gun at Manuel and squeezed Rachel 's windpipe tighter with his left arm . The room was beginning to spin . <p> " We 're not on the air yet , " he hissed , his frustration showing . " Somebody get in that control room . " <p> Manuel glanced quickly at the booth . " They 're gone . " <p> " I can see they 're gone ! " Jamison shouted . He turned and unloaded another stream of bullets toward the control booth , the gunshots echoing in Rachel 's ear . The bullets shattered the glass of the booth into tiny shards that dropped onto the sound and edit board . <p> He again pointed the gun toward Manuel . " Get us on the air . " <p> Manuel shook his head , beads of sweat popping on his forehead even in the clammy cool air of the studio . " I c-ca n't ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're useless . " <p> Manuel opened his mouth-a silent plea , too scared to talk . <p> Rachel was losing consciousness fast , the edges of her vision going dark . How many shots has Jamison fired ? How many are left ? She said a quick prayer and threw her elbow backward into his gut , heard him grunt , and tried to squirm free . She had nearly twisted out of his arm , but he drove the corner of the gun 's rectangular magazine against her skull . The blow knocked her to the ground . Dizzy , she could feel blood oozing down her forehead . <p> She looked up at Jamison with blurred vision . She blinked and crawled a few feet backward . <p> " You think I 'm playing games ? " Jamison asked . <p> Terrified , Rachel shook her head . He smiled at her and popped a second magazine out , quickly jamming a third into place . <p> Jamison tilted his head back and shouted . " We 're not on the air ! Every minute we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a step closer and looked down at Rachel . " Maybe I 'll start with you . " His eyes flashed with excitement . " Put your hands behind your back and lie facedown . " <p> Rachel did as she was told , fighting panic . To her left , she saw a flicker of movement , a crouching figure . She forced herself not to look . She hoped it was Bob Thomas , the show 's director , a tall and lanky man who had disappeared once the gunshots started . Bob would not let her die . <p> Jamison walked over to Rachel . He stepped over top of her , straddling her . His breath came in short , hard bursts . <p> " Beg . " <p> For a split second contempt battled her fear . She would n't beg for this man-he 'd fire anyway . But she knew she needed time . She closed her eyes . " Please do n't hurt me , " she said . " I can help you get out of this . " <p> Jamison laughed-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said softly . <p> She opened her eyes and looked over her shoulder , her neck craned as she stared at her tormentor . He bent closer , his face twisted with the pleasure of revenge . The black barrel of the gun dominated her field of vision , his maniacal grin forming the backdrop . " You need to learn a little humility , " he said . " You do n't know what it means to beg , do you ? " <p> He grabbed her hair and pulled her head back farther . " Please , " she said , tears stinging her eyes . Pain throbbed on her cheek and radiated from her neck . She closed her eyes , but the image of the black barrel and Jamison 's face would n't go away . " Please do n't shoot . " <p> " That 's not begging , " Jamison said . He let go of her hair and her head dropped toward the floor . She braced herself , feeling helpless , waiting for the impact of the bullet . She thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheltered in her womb . It was supposed to be a safe place . <p> " Open your eyes ! " <p> She did . Just in time to see Jamison turn the gun on Manuel Sanchez . " Say good-bye to your buddy . " <p> " No ! " she shouted . <p> Before Manuel could move , Jamison fired . Rachel gasped as a small hole opened in the middle of Manuel 's forehead . He grunted-the air fleeing his body-and slouched to the floor . <p> Rachel saw Manuel 's eyes go glassy as blood poured from his head . She turned away , vomit rising in her throat . <p> " You need to learn how to beg , " Jamison said , his voice flat . " Now get in your seat . " <p> Rachel got to one knee , and the room started spinning . She hesitated , wiping blood away from her eyes and mouth . She watched Jamison kick Manuel 's lifeless body , rolling the co-anchor onto his back . <p> " Hurry up ! " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die had changed things . Instead of making Rachel more afraid , it somehow steeled her . She felt responsible for Manuel 's death-this whole thing was her fault . Jamison was here because of Rachel . Now it was up to her to think clearly . Somebody had to make sure there was no more bloodshed until help arrived . <p> She staggered to her seat , keeping a wary eye on Jamison . He had moved behind Lisa . <p> " Get us on the air , " he said to Lisa . <p> " I 'm trying , " Lisa said , her voice shaking , lips trembling . " But please ... " she choked out , " stop pointing that gun at me . " <p> " You 've got thirty seconds , " Jamison said . <p> Lisa caught her breath . She pointed to a spot on the right side of the studio . " Behind there , " she said , " is our director . He can run the control booth . " <p> " Nice , " Jamison said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his hiding spot , ordering him into the control booth . A minute or two later , the large television on the floor in front of the anchor desk and the other television suspended from the ceiling changed from a technical difficulties message to a live shot of the desk . Rachel was shocked by her own appearance , blood streaking down her face and staining her blouse . She pushed back her hair and waited . <p> How long before a SWAT team storms this place ? <p> Jamison was just one man . Surely if the four of them acted together ... <p> Jamison settled in next to the sole camerawoman operating the huge boom camera . She had it on a wide-angle shot that showed both Lisa and Rachel . Jamison kept the gun on Rachel , periodically glancing over his shoulder to check the studio door . <p> " This is Larry Jamison ! " he yelled , his voice loud enough to be picked up by the wireless mikes that Lisa and Rachel wore . " You 've just seen vicious lies broadcast by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . <p> " Introduce yourself ! " Jamison shouted . He pointed the gun at Lisa . <p> " I 'm Lisa Roberts , " she said , her voice unsteady , an octave higher than normal . Out of habit , she looked straight at the camera . <p> Jamison swung the gun toward Rachel . For a moment , just long enough to show the slightest flicker of resistance , Rachel did n't speak . <p> " And I 'm Rachel Crawford , " she eventually said , " a member of the WDXR I-team . " <p> " Ten minutes ago , this woman lied to you ! " Jamison shouted . " And now she 's going to stand trial for it . " <p> He checked over his shoulder one more time and then moved forward , circling around behind the anchor desk so that he stood between Lisa and Rachel . Rachel watched as Jamison checked himself out on the TV monitors , then pointed the gun at the side of her head . <p> God help me . <p> ( Continues ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
