<p> Just for the record , he blinked first . After exactly 18 minutes of conversation , Stedman Graham  --  businessman , author , educator , former pro basketball player and well-rounded , highly accomplished citizen in his own right  --  mentions Oprah . <p> I record the moment in my notebook with a giant " O. " Later , I 'll count 17 " O 's , " which works out to about one Oprah mention every 31/2 minutes for the rest of the interview . ( Full disclosure : I did ask three Oprah-related questions . ) <p> Waiting for Graham to arrive  --  he was late , having mistakenly gone to a different members-only lunch spot before arriving at the Sear Tower 's luxe Metropolitan Club  --  I 'd decided to take him at his word . He is not just Oprah 's boyfriend . He has written several books ( or , anyway , supervised writer Wes Smith as he wrote several books ) and teaches business classes at four universities , including , most recently , the University of Illinois at Chicago 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course in leadership . He 's also launching an educational program called " Teens Can Make It Happen , " which is being piloted at several schools in California . He deserves an opportunity to talk about his own life , and his own causes . To be , in other words , more than just " Mr. Oprah . " <p> So , holding back all the shallow what's- going-on-with-that-Dr . Phil-anyway ? questions and fighting the impulse to beg for personal details  --  What are you guys eating these days ? Is it true there 's a feud with Starbucks because they wo n't let your dogs in ? Is Oprah ever not soulful and enlightened , like maybe first thing in the morning ? Why ca n't you just get married ?  --  I virtuously ask about his mission to build self-esteem in young adults , especially black boys , and whether he thinks playing sports ultimately helps or hurts them . <p> Graham starts by talking about his own life experiences , how basketball built his confidence and gave him new opportunities . He proudly lists some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe and , yes , having a relationship with one of the most powerful women in the world . Over the course of the monologue , he manages to offer at least two answers to my original question , each passionate and sincere . <p> First he says , " If I did n't have basketball , I 'd have been lost . . . . I developed self-confidence because I could play ball . " <p> Then later he says , " Sixty-seven percent of African-American boys think they 're going to be a professional athlete . . . they do n't focus on anything else but that , and they lose nine-tenths of the rest of their lives . That 75 percent of the prison system is African-American men is directly attributable to the sports and entertainment industries . It 's killing our black kids . " <p> It 's a having-it-both-ways kind of answer , the first of many . It allows him to take a stand without taking a too-large bite of the hands that feed him . He handles questions about his connection to Oprah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy for what she does , but it really does n't have anything to do with me "  --  but stressing their link when it fits his purpose . <p> " We have the same message about maximizing people 's potential , " he says , " She does on TV what I do on the ground . " <p> Despite the unshakable feeling that Oprah is somehow present for our conversation , we are , in fact , dining alone in a private room . It 's about the size of a standard corporate board room , although it looks bigger because our small , elegantly set table for two is pretty much the only thing in it . A waiter hovers self-consciously by the door , working hard at being unobtrusive . He has my sympathies . Graham is not easily interrupted . His physical presence fills the room  --  he 's 6 feet 6 and his perfectly shined black loafers are size 15  --  and his business school eloquence includes few pauses , dramatic or otherwise . He has the seasoned lecturer 's trick of talking directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's able to ignore you without seeming to and to offer you advice that you have n't exactly asked for . I find myself wondering if he talks this way at home . Or maybe he never gets a word in there . <p> When the waiter , full of apologies , does manage to step in , Graham orders black bean soup , a shrimp Caesar salad and a Perrier . He consumes them neatly and quickly , his manicured hands making only the slightest movements as he talks and eats . Graham does n't touch the bread basket and does n't even consider coffee or dessert . His well-trained physique is evident under the cut of his custom-made shirt . <p> " Part of my personal brand , " he says , " is getting up and working out in the morning . " <p> Stedman Graham has put a lot of thought into his personal brand . And he says everybody else should , too . I suppose that working out every morning is an important part of my personal brand , too , but I suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompany my trips to the gym are , unfortunately , also key elements . <p> " What separates you from someone else ? " he asks and answers himself in the same breath , " Marketing . " <p> Graham is a marketing expert , the founder of a well-regarded sports marketing firm and the author of a textbook on the subject . He is also the author of two books  --  You Can Make It Happen and Build Your Own Life Brand !  --  that translate his business expertise into the kind of self-help , personal-growth material that is favored by , well , Oprah viewers . The books have sold well and have become the basis for Graham 's corporate training and lecture circuit businesses . As Graham rightly points out , they have n't been " Oprah 's Book Club " selections , and they do n't feature her endorsements or blurbs on their jackets . Still , she is present in each one , popping up frequently in the text as an example or a source of inspiration . She has , after all , managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk me through the nine-step success process outlined in You Can Make It Happen . It is , he says , the prerequisite to creating Brand Debra Pickett . A cynic might note that unless one of the steps is " Become romantically involved with a popular television personality , " the process is unlikely to work as well for me as it has for Graham . But I 'm not a cynic . I 'm here to learn . <p> He asks me what my passion is . I tell him it 's writing . <p> " Oh . . . " he says , nodding in approval , " that 's good . Writing is a good one . " <p> Then we set to work . <p> " What you want to do , " he counsels , " is build a program so people pay you what you 're worth , not just what they pay writers . " <p> He says it with such contempt for my profession that I 'm sure he must have seen my last paycheck . I blush in deep shame as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework for the multimedia empire I should be building , the one he says will bring in about $5 million a year , as soon as I get my act together and start my own publishing house and consulting firm . <p> The prospect is so exciting that I forget to ask him my most important question : Should my boyfriend hurry up and marry me before I become a multimedia brand ? <p> E-mail : dpickett@suntimes.com
