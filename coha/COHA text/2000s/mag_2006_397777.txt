A story of personal triumph over years of pain and disability . <p> In the autumn of 1979 , while training for the Boston Marathon , I ruptured a lumbar disc . When the pain did not immediately subside . I underwent a discectomy , a limited operation that removed the edge of the bulging disc . The surgery did not fully return me to my prior state . When I tried to run , a dull ache grew in my back and hip . <p> Six months after the surgery . I moved from Boston to Los Angeles . One Sunday morning after breakfast , I stood up from a chair and collapsed . My lower back fell as if it were being twisted in a vise , and electric shocks sped down my buttocks into my legs . <p> X rays showed no clear cause for tile pain . There were no ruptured discs . I saw many consultants : rheumatologists , neurosurgeons , doctors of sports medicine . Each told me that the lumbar spine is a " black box " and often a mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions . Finally , an orthopedist in Beverly Hills told me what I wanted to hear : " Your spine is unstable . " he said . " I can fix it with a fusion . You 'll be running ill a few weeks . " A fusion , done by harvesting bone from my pelvis and inserting it like a bridge along the sides of my lower vertebrae , would create an internal brace and remedy my lumbar instability . The heady promise of running again erased any other consideration . <p> I awoke from the operation in the intensive care unit , red blood cells being infused into lily arms . As the anesthesia lightened . I was hit with excruciating pain throughout my lower body like none I had ever experienced . <p> Even more terrifying , I could not move my legs . They seemed to be frozen . No one was sure why . The orthopedist postulated that the blood spilled during surgery had inflamed my nerve roots , causing the severe pain and preventing my legs from functioning normally . I was taken home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit tightly around my lower torso . It prevented me from moving too far in any direction and stressing the bone grafts . But it was hardly necessary to artificially immobilize me . The pain was so severe that I could not stand or sit . I was in bed all day and all night , sleeping a few scant hours only with large closes of painkillers . Yet even narcotics could not stop the relentless pain in my back , buttocks , and legs . For months l lay on ice packs . the numbing cold affording a few moments of relief . <p> When I returned to see the orthopedic surgeon , I asked why I was n't getting better . His words wove a tight narrative of what I could look forward to : " You must have developed scars around the nerves from all the inflammation . With the nerves tethered , every time you move quickly , or twist or turn . they get tugged , setting off the pain . " <p> My throat closing , I asked what could be done . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scar . " <p> Would n't that cause further inflammation and new scars ? <p> Probably yes . <p> I returned home feeling as if I had entered a maze with no exit in which I would wander from one point of pain to the next . <p> I began physical therapy at a local facility . Most of the people in the treatment area were elderly , with severely arthritic hips and knees that had been replaced . The staff was corn passionate and encouraging , but the therapy was largely passive . I would lie on my back , and the therapists would slowly move my legs up and down . Then they put me in a warm pool with submerged parallel bars . I took step after faltering step , learning to walk again . <p> A stretcher was moved into my laboratory , and I spent most of the day flat , reading scientific articles and planning experiments with my technicians . I learned how to do basic things in ways that did n't set off pain  --  how to get up from a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something from the floor . After nearly two years , I could swim four or five laps and sit on a stationary bicycle to pedal some minutes . <p> In the quiet of the day , the orthopedic surgeon 's words echoed in my mind , that the scar would encase my nerves for life . Disgusted with myself for undergoing the fusion surgery , I decided Io stay away from doctors . One had badly hurt me , and none could help me . I would have to live within narrow limits . <p> And so , for 19 years , I did . The boundary on my life was like an electrified fence at the perimeter of a prison : If I ventured too far and tested it , I was thrown back from the shock of its force into my confinement . If I stayed inside the fence , I was somewhat safe . So , I assessed each movement and task of the waking day for its distance from that perilous perimeter . When I awoke in the morning , I would shift my legs over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the force of my forearms to avoid a pull on my back . In my laboratory . I would lean at a minimal angle to peer into the ocular of a microscope , or to inspect cells in a Petri dish , because quick flexion was risky . On ward rounds , I would sit down every ten minutes or so to rest my back . <p> When my sons were in grade school , I wanted to teach them to play baseball , but swinging a bat triggered sharp pains in my back , and I retreated to the sidelines . When my four-year-old daughter climbed monkey bars and jungle gyms , I worried that I lacked the resilience to catch her if she fell . I had been an avid walker , strolling the neighborhood in the evenings for an hour or more with Pam , but now , after 1 walked four or five blocks , my hips and back would cramp , forcing me to abandon the excursion . <p> There were periods of respite . months of relative comfort , but then an apparently innocuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never knew when or where it might happen . Along with unpredictable pain came its companion , a sense of prevailing fear . <p> In the summer of 1999 , such an unpredictable event occurred . A close friend , aghast at my restricted mobility , had encouraged me to try back massage . I was leery of allowing anyone to touch my spine , and my concern was borne out . Despite the licensed massage therapist 's good intentions , he was too aggressive in his work . I left the session with a growing ache , and by the end of the day I was gripped by vicious pain from the base of my neck to the bottom of my coccyx . Days passed , and the muscle spasm did not relent . <p> Frustrated , in deepening pain , I sought advice from a rheumatologist , an expert in bone and joint disease . at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center where I work . He examined me and said that the muscles in my back had been traumatized by the massage : with rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain should quiet down , and I would return to my previous level of functioning . But he made me promise that when this flare up abated , I would see a physician at the New England Baptist Hospital who specialized in rehabilitation medicine , Dr. James Rainville . " He may be able to help you in a more fundamental way , " the rheumatologist said . " The Baptist was where Larry Bird was put on his feet after his back problem . I nodded politely but did not believe that anything substantial could be done . <p> Like all Celtics fans , I had closely followed Bird 's condition , especially given my years of debility . He had undergone spine surgery and returned from rehabilitation still a star . And basketball was an unforgiving sport : The impact  --  as you fought for rebounds under the boards , took jump shots from the three point line , and made last breaks  --  would tax even a normal spine . Bird seemed more than able to keep up . <p> Contrary to the rheumatologist 's prognosis , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had episodic pains not only in my lower back but also between my shoulders and in my neck . I moved through the day with even more tension and worry than before . and I shied away from any activity that might exacerbate the muscle spasms . I went for an MRI scan of my spine , but it did not reveal a cause for the muscle spasms that gripped me from my neck to my hips . <p> Weeks passed , and my despair deepened . I came home from work exhausted by the pain . For almost two decades , I had tried to achieve an uneasy truce with my condition . Now it seemed as if I had violated the terms of the treaty , disregarding the limits that were set for me . Because it did n't make sense that the pain would be lasting for weeks , it became even more frightening . Pain can be a volatile and fickle force and . when provoked , might unleash a torrent that overwhelms the initial provocation . I knew of cases in which people suffered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remedies  --  resting in bed on ice packs . taking Valium for muscle spasms , gently stretching my legs and torso  --  were to no avail . With the sense that I had nothing to lose but also that my plight would only be confirmed , I visited Dr. James Rainville at the Spine Center of the New England Baptist Hospital . <p> The New England Baptist Hospital is a stately old brick building at the crest of Boston 's Mission Hill . Its large lobby is appointed much like a traditional Yankee living room , with muted carpeting , upholstered wing chairs , and an antique grandfather clock . A long , narrow corridor leads from the lobby to the clinics and operating rooms . Along this passageway , the history and achievements of the hospital are presented in a series of enlarged photographs arranged chronologically and annotated like a display at a museum . <p> As I walked down the corridor , my eyes stopped at a picture of a young Senator Edward Kennedy . He was lying in bed , his head propped up , offering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that , as a young man , Kennedy had been in a plane crash and had fractured his spine . He had come to the Baptist Hospital for rehabilitation . I tried to recall recent images of the senator that might indicate continued debility . But newspaper pictures and TV footage showed Kennedy standing tall in Congress . deftly navigating his boat off Hyannis , and walking briskly on the campaign trail . There was no hint that he was once bedridden with a fractured spine . <p> A few short steps down the corridor was a photographic tableau of Larry Bird . In the first photo , he was seated next to a smiling doctor in surgical garb . An adjoining picture showed Bird in the midst of physical therapy . The text explained that the celebrated Celtic had been successfully restored to the parquet of the Boston Garden . I lingered , studying Bird , his physician , and his physical therapist , then proceeded to the Spine Center oil the fifth floor . <p> As I changed into a hospital gown , I cursed myself once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My thoughts were broken as Dr. Rainville strode into the examining room . He was a tall , athletic man with thick , graying eyebrows and the rugged good looks of a Hollywood gunslinger , tie greeted me with a firm handshake . " Tell me the story from the beginning , " he said . <p> I recounted the past 19 years  --  the running injury , the fusion surgery , the many precautions of my days , ending with the massage and the unrelenting spasms . <p> Dr. Rainville listened intently , his face registering no reaction . He began a detailed physical examination , testing each muscle and joint individually lot strength by pressing with his palm . Then he applied a calibrated instrument that resembled a protractor and took exact measurements of the range of rotation of my hips , spine , and neck as I moved forward , bent backward . and turned to each side . My muscles tensed as I performed each of these maneuvers , and my jaw tightened in fear that the physical examination it self might release a shower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my spine on a lighted box on the wall and systematically inspected the film , vertebra by vertebra . Seemingly satisfied that he had reviewed all the relevant data , he turned and stood before me . <p> " You are worshiping the volcano god of pain . " he declared . " The volcano god of pain is your master . " <p> I had been warned that Rainville was a brash , in-your-face clinician who field contrarian views . But what on earth was he talking about ? <p> " What do I mean that you are worshiping the volcano god of pain ? " he asked . " You interpret pain as a red flag , a warning that yon are doing damage to your body . So you sacrifice things that you love , activities that give your life joy . to be kept free from pain . You say to the volcano god : ' I will give up walking long distances if you keep me out of pain . I will give up lifting my children if you keep me out of pain . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine . Just keep me from pain . ' <p> " But this god is never fully satisfied with any offering : It is appeased for only a short while . So the more you sacrifice , the more the god demands , until your life contracts , as it has , into a very , very narrow space . <p> " I believe you can be freed from your pain . I believe you can rebuild yourself and do much , much more . " <p> I studied James Rainville 's face . He had the burning eyes of a zealot , and he read my thoughts . <p> " Bullshit talks , results walk , " he said . " You think what I am saying is complete bullshit . You 've lived all these years with out any real hope , and it 's hard to open that door and glimpse a different kind of life . " He paused and then spoke with gravity . " It 's your choice : to try or not to try . You can walk out of my office now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and live the way you have . Or you can lest me . And I 'll tell you now , I 'm right . " <p> I remained mute , unsure how to respond to this bar rage . My thoughts raced : He does n't understand my condition , the immutable scars from the surgery . He is dangerous , threatening to upset even the little equilibrium I 've established over the years . But then a strange , powerful thought welled up : Could he be right ? <p> " How can I test you ? " I finally asked . <p> " Ignore the pain . " Dr. Rainville shot back . " No more worshiping this god . No more sacrifices . Just disregard its demands . The pain does n't mean anything serious . As your mind reorients its beliefs , the pain will lessen . Once that happens , you will be able to rebuild your body . It wo n't be easy or quick or with out setbacks . The muscles in your lower back are at 30 percent of their normal tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . They carry a memory of the trauma done to you , and they recall the pain at the slightest provocation . By using your spine , muscles , and ligaments , and strengthening them , you erase that memory . You can compensate for the damage that was done and live a normal life again . " <p> Rainville explained the basics of the program he was prescribing . My muscles would be challenged steadily with increasing weights until they were " reeducated " to relinquish their memory of past pain . Despite what I would feel during this process  --  almost certainly an increase In the muscle spasms and release of the familiar electric shocks over my buttocks and thighs  --  was not at risk of being hurt . Everything that was being done to my body would serve to rewire my brain until strength and endurance were restored and the perception of pain erased . <p> My heart was racing as I exited the hospital . It was strange : There was a perverse comfort in inertia . As a physician , I had learned the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite education and knowledge and experience , when you are the patient  --  suffering , confused , and despairing  --  it is very , very hard to take matters into your own hands . I was not like some patients who are able to stand alone and challenge the prevailing assumptions . I needed an external voice , strong and determined , to guide me . <p> But what if Rainville was wrong ? His arduous rehabilitation program might end for me with worse pain . A mere massage had triggered weeks and weeks of suffering . What would even greater stresses do ? <p> And what was he really saying in cold biological terms , not flamboyant metaphors of volcano gods ? That changing my beliefs could dampen flaming circuits of pain ? Was I some mystic or yogi who could walk barefoot over hot coals or lie down on a bed of nails ? <p> As the days passed , l kept returning to Dr. Rainville 's words , I pictured resuming activities so long gone . 1 imagined myself stronger , able to walk comfortably , to lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the possibility became too much to resist . With trepidation , I enrolled in the Baptist 's rehabilitation program , I was alarmed when the physical therapists took me into the treatment room . it was a large , open space filled with what looked like instruments of torture . A group of patients was in the midst of therapy , doing things that seemed designed to cause , not erase . pain : picking up milk crates filled with lead bricks ; brusquely rotating their torsos while holding a heavy medicine ball ; performing a back press against several hundred pounds . Was Rainville out of his mind ? How could I ever risk such maneuvers ? The thought of it terrified me . <p> But deep down flickered the desire to fight . <p> The therapist prescribed three weeks of daily stretching at home before I could take part in formal rehabilitation exercises . If I acted too quickly , my muscles would be over whelmed , and I might abandon the attempt . He instructed me to begin slowly , to move bones and joints that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausting : my body was so feeble that even lilting my legs up against gravity broke a sweat . <p> It was the beginning of the school year when I went back to the treatment room . Boston in early September pulses with the steady pace of young men and women returning to college . nervous anticipation on their faces . I told myself I was a new student , ready to reeducate my mind and body . But it did n't prove so easy . Even the first lessons in Rainville 's classroom were daunting . Each exercise caused shooting pains in my back that ran down my buttocks , thighs , and feet . The therapists were unmoved by my pains , telling me firmly to keep challenging my body . I would leave the sessions depleted , needing to rest for hours , lying in bed oil ice packs to numb the protesting nerves and muscles . <p> When the pain and exhaustion from the maneuvers were at their worst . when doubt raised its strident voice and said Rainville 's talk was bullshit , I summoned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my daughter to a pond some two miles from our home to feed ducks and search for frogs ; emerging from an airplane feeling strong and ready to explore a new city : dancing a traditional Eastern European circle dance at a family wedding . <p> Each fantasy released a current of warm , soft energy that suffused my body . My exhausted muscles and taut ligaments seemed deeply nourished in its wake . My spine , in its cacophony of pain , became distinctly quieter . These physical perceptions made me feel foolish and perplexed but also curiously intrigued . <p> Over three months or so , the constant pain became intermittent , then rare . " The body has a remarkable ability to heal , " the physical therapist had said to me at the start of one session . Those words conjured a very different picture of what existed in my body . Yes , as the orthopedist said , there had been inflammation and probably some scarring . But it was not irremediable . There were ways for the muscles , ligaments , and tendons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insulate the nerves from the strain of sharp movements . Even when the nerves spoke up , the messages they sent to the brain were modulated , their anger tempered , so that severe pain did not result . Over time these messages , once bellowing , could become a whisper , and then fall largely silent . <p> I realized that the surgeon had said to me what I had so ineptly said at times in my career to others : that there was no hope . Medicine is too uncertain a science , biology too variable , to have that kind of hubris . <p> I began to walk  --  five blocks , then ten , then 15 , then a mile . I challenged myself to travel longer distances , to hike one or two steep hills . I felt more at ease with and more eager about my rehabilitation exercises . Advancing to each new level caused days of spasm and pain , but I tried to ignore it all , repeating Rainville 's mantra that my body was relinquishing an old form of memory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were limits , that I was vulnerable to injury . I joined an aerobics class called " Funky Groove " that involved doing 250 jumping jacks while ear splitting techno music blared in the background . The pounding proved too much for my muscles and joints and caused persistent pain that did not resolve with the Rainville regimen . So I quit the class . I realized I was not 27 years old any more . But I also told myself that I could live happily within my new boundaries . I had gained , above all , the sense that I had some level of control over my choices . <p> After a little over a year , the daily pains all but passed . I awoke in the morning unafraid , moved through the day comfortably , and fell asleep with a prayer of thanksgiving on my lips . I felt reborn , it seemed almost magical . <p> For the roughly two thirds of all Americans who will experience significant lower back pain once during their lives , Harvard physician timid author Dr. Jerome Groopman offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Jerome E.
