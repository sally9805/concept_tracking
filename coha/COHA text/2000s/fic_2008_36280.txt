Samson Brown loved exactly two things in this world : his wife and his elephant . He nearly loved lots of others , of course , and had loved dearly some who were now dead and gone  --  his folks , his twin brother Jimmy , an old blue dog he 'd had once  --  but real love , in the here-and-now , he reserved for Corinna and Hannah . He knew it , and he made sure they knew it , too . Loving that hard and exclusive did n't make up for the things he could n't give them  --  and there were lots of things he could n't give them  --  but it went a ways . To a man like Sam , a realistic man , that was something . <p> The hot-poker truth about the limitations of love was something they 'd learned from the dead baby girl Corinna had delivered forty-three years ago , a perfect child with hands as small and tight as fiddleheads . The grief had nearly killed them , grief as solid and mean and unyielding as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shaking from the weight of it and had no choice but to put it down . The doctor had told them there was nothing they could have done to bring their baby out alive ; things like that just happened , he said , and sometimes no one knew why . Whatever the reason , the loss of that baby had changed them forever , especially Corinna , a woman who 'd wanted only three things out of life : Sam , a child to raise , and a reasonably good relationship with the Lord . She 'd gotten Sam all these years . Her relationship with the Lord was another thing . <p> Still , at sixty-five Corinna was solid as an old tree , someone you could get a purchase on even in a high wind . Many a time she 'd kept him going , this big , beautiful woman who always had time when people came to talk or asked her thoughts about something . And Lord God , but Corinna did have her thoughts . I 've got opinions I 'll give away for free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying . Sam 's already heard them all , and God stopped listening a long time ago . And she 'd laugh a laugh that was like warm syrup pouring from a jug . <p> <br> <p> Sam turned at the corner of Powers and Luke Street and then into the Dunkin ' Donuts drive-through . " Hey , " he greeted Rayette at the window . <p> " Hey , sugar , " she said . Rayette was a nice-looking young woman who wore her hair in a million tiny braids Corinna did for her once a month . One thing about Rayette , she always made sure she looked good , never mind anything that might be going on with her two kids and occasional husband  --  and it seemed like there was always something going on . " You want Bavarian cream today ? They just came out , " she asked him . <p> " Nah . She does n't like them as much as she used to . How about two custards and a jelly ? You got any of those strawberry ones ? She likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rayette ducked inside . <p> She 'd been selling him donuts for years . When she fetched up at the window again , holding his bag of donuts and some coffee , he asked her , " How long have you been doing Dunkin ' Donuts ? Ten years , maybe ? " <p> " More like fourteen , honey . Where 've you been ? " Rayette frowned . " Be fifteen at the end of November . " It was September , now . " We 're getting old , hon. " <p> " Do n't I know it , " Sam said , shaking his head . Rayette held onto the bag of donuts for him while he fussed up some change from under the driver 's seat . " Shoot . I 'm sorry , I know I 've got another couple quarters down here  --  " He found them and handed them over . Rayette passed him the donut bag and a cup of coffee hot enough to scald a rhino . One time Sam had n't set his cup securely and it had tipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blister on his leg . He knew why that woman had won her lawsuit against McDonald 's , even if most people thought she was a gold digger . <p> " What happened to that new girl you had ? " he asked , stowing the coffee in a cup holder clear on the other side of the car . " She gone already ? " <p> " Well , you know how they are . Kids got no staying power these days , think they should get rich overnight and when it does n't happen they dump you like it was your fault . " <p> " Mmmm hmmm . " Sam breathed in the scent of donuts . He 'd had to give them up a year ago , when he was diagnosed with the diabetes . <p> " Corinna said you were thinking about retirement again , " Rayette said , leaning out the drive-through window on her elbows . <p> " Yeah , I 've been thinking about it . " <p> " Well , you just go through with it this time , hon. I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " When the time 's right for Hannah , I 'll go . " <p> Rayette just shook her head . " She 'd get over it , honey . God makes His creatures strong . I swear , the things you 've done for her all these years . " <p> " Yeah . Well , I got to go , " Sam said . He would brook no negative comments about Hannah , never had . " I 'll see you . " " I guess you will , " Rayette said . " You watch yourself around that coffee , now . " <p> Sam steered his old Dodge Dart back into morning traffic , making sure the coffee and the bag of donuts were secure . He was a careful man and it paid off . At sixty-eight , even by his own lights , he looked damned good . He stood upright and proud , no gut whatsoever , not even a little one people would have forgiven him for , at his age . A little snowfall on the top of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temples , either . Seeing him from the back , you might think he was twenty , but when he turned around his face gave him away . It was deeply lined , like a roadmap starting someplace far away  --  Cincinnati , maybe , where he was born , or Yakima , Washington , where his daddy had had a truck farm ; then Korea , where Sam had served in the war ; and ending right here in Bladenham , Washington . <p> He drove the last mile to the Max L. Biedelman Zoo fighting a powerful urge to take a bite of one of the donuts . He was n't a drinking man or a smoker , never had been , but he did miss his Dunkin ' Donuts . <p> <br> Continues ...
