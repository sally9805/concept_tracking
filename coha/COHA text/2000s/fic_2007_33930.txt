Chapter One Delaney knew he 'd been in the dream before , knew from the hurting whiteness , the icy needles that closed his eyes , the silence , the force of the river wind . But knowing it was a dream did not ease his fear . As before , he waved his bare hands to push through the whiteness , but as before the whiteness was porous and he knew it was snow . As before , there was no horizon . As before , his feet floated through frozen powder . There was no ground beneath him . There was nothing to grip . No picket fence . No lamppost . And no people . No friend . No woman . As before : just the driving force of the snow ... Then he was awake in the blue darkness . A sound . A bell . His hand clumsy with sleep , he lifted the black telephone on the night table . Still dead . Someone at the wrought iron gate below the stoop was jerking the old bell rope , making an urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times . Shivering in cotton summer- time pajamas , he threw off the covers . Ding-ding-DING . The window shade was raised a foot , the window two inches , part of Delaney 's desire for fresh air on the coldest winter nights . Drifted snow covered the oaken sill . He raised the shade and could see the snow moving horizontally from the North River . The wind whined . A midnight snowfall was now a dawn blizzard . Ripping in from the west along Horatio Street . Goddamn you , Monique ! Answer the goddamned bell ! And remembered that his nurse was gone for the long New Year 's holiday , off somewhere with her boyfriend . Delaney pulled a flannel robe over his shoulders and parted the dark blue drapes , as if obeying the orders of the downstairs bell . Ding- ding . Ding- ding- DING . He glanced at the clock . Six-seventeen . The bell demanding attention . On a day of morning sleep all over New York . He raised the window , its glass rimed with the cold . Snow blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driving snow and looked down . At the gate under the stoop , a man was pulling the rope attached to the bell . Delaney knew him . A man who looked like an icebox in an overcoat . Bootsie , they called him . Bootsie Cirillo . Snow was piled on his pearl-gray fedora and the shoulders of his dark blue overcoat . At the sound of the window rising , he had stepped back and was now looking up . " Doc ? Eddie Corso sent me , Doc . " His voice was raspy . " He needs you . Right now . " " Give me five minutes , " Delaney said . " Make it t'ree . " Delaney sighed , closed the window , and dressed quickly in rough clothes . Thinking : These goddamned hoods are worse since the movies got sound . Make it t'ree . Christ , I 'm too old for these guys . He pulled a sweater over his denim shirt , added a scarf and a cloth cap with a longshoreman 's pin . A gift from Knocko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bridgemen 's shoes and took his time lacing them . Then he pocketed keys , some dollar bills , picked up his worn black leather bag , and went down the hall stairs to go out through the gate under the stoop . The snow hit his face , again like needles . Again he closed his eyes . The dream , the goddamned dream ... all the way from the last years of the nineteenth century . " You took too much time , Doc , " Bootsie said . " This is fucking bad . " He turned and shook the snow off his fedora and used it to brush powder off his shoulders . Snow was gathering on the roof and hood of the black Packard that was two feet from the curb . Bootsie jerked open the door on the passenger side , gesturing with his head for Delaney to get in , then moved around to take the wheel . " We 're late , " he said . " I did my best , Bootsie , " Delaney said , sliding into the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car and pulled out , the snow rising loosely from the hood . Bootsie drove east on Horatio Street , the wind whipping hard behind them . There was no traffic . The car skidded on the turn at Hudson Street . " Maybe I should walk , " Delaney said . " Eddie 's maybe nine blocks from here . " " He 's a thousand miles from here if you get us killed , Bootsie . " The fat man grunted , slowed down . The window was foggy from their breathing , and Bootsie took out a white silk handkerchief and wiped at it . Then handed the handkerchief to Delaney . The doctor wiped at the steamy front window on his side , then rolled the side window down an inch . Bootsie grunted . " How come you do n't got a car ? " Bootsie said . " You could follow me . " " Ca n't afford it . " " Come on . You 're a doctor . " " That 's why I ca n't afford it . " " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They 're poor , Bootsie . They still get sick . " The fat man turned , made a right and another right , heading toward Little Italy . A few kids were coming down from the tenements . One of them was carrying a surplice , its hem emerging below a wrapping of Christmas paper , the boy off to serve the seven o'clock mass at Sacred Heart . As Delaney so often did , long ago . He noticed that up here the streetlights were still working . Another zone in the city grid . Another world . " What happened to Eddie ? " " You 'll find out . " " Maybe I could get ready if you told me what happened . " Bootsie sighed , pondered this , made another turn through the snow- packed streets . Parked cars were turning into immense white sculptures in the wind- driven snow . " Mr. Corso got shot , maybe an hour ago . " " Where ? " " The stomach . Maybe the arm too . And maybe the hand . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where 'd it happen ? " " The club . We had a New Year 's party , all the guys , the wives . A band too , and all the usual shit , noisemakers , funny hats . Most people go home , maybe t'ree in the morning . Some of the guys go over Chinatown to get laid . Then there 's a card game , whiskey , a big pot . I cook up some breakfast , scramble eggs , sausage , the usual . Then in the door comes t'ree jaboneys , guns out . They do n't say a word . They just start shooting . Then everybody 's shooting . The t'ree shooters go down , but so does Mr. Corso . He 's hurt real bad , but he says , ' Go throw these cocksuckers in the river . ' I stay with him while the other guys haul the dead guys away . It 's still dark , see ? Nobody on the street . All the lights out . No cops . Nothing . Just the fucking snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing the Good Men Social and Athletic Club . The street was empty . He and Delaney got out . Bootsie knocked on the door . Three fast raps , then two . A sallow man with dead eyes peered out , opened the door wider . Most of the lights were out . " Took your fuckin ' time , " the sallow man said to Bootsie . " Fast as I could , Carmine . It 's a fuckin ' blizzard out there . " The club was a mess of noisemakers , funny hats , overturned tables , and blood . Delaney could see smears through the blood where bodies had been dragged . Against the wall , Eddie Corso was lying on a cot . He smiled thinly when he saw Delaney . " Medic , medic , " he whispered , and then grinned in a bleary way . There was blood on his face , probably from his wet crimson hand , but there was a huge spreading stain of blood on the white shirt . " Jesus , it hurts like a bastard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He grinned . " Morphine , morphine ... " The call of the trenches in the rain . " Please , Doc ... " Corso laughed and then moaned , and Delaney gave him what he needed . He swabbed his arm with cotton soaked in alcohol , prepared a syringe , then injected him with a shot of morphine . Corso winced , then sighed in a gargly way . Delaney ripped open the bloody shirt to look at the worst wound , then used pressure and tape to staunch the bleeding . " You 've got to go to a hospital , Eddie . " " A hospital ? You nuts ? You might as well drive me to the Daily News . " His voice was quavering and whispery with morphine . " This ca n't get out . This - " " I ca n't do what you need , Eddie , " Delaney said . " You need a surgeon . " " You did it in the Argonne , Doc ! " " And botched it for too many guys . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a professional surgeon , Eddie . Someone whose right hand works right , not like mine . Someone at St. Vincent 's . " " Anybody comes in shot , the nuns call the cops . " " Let me see what I can do , " Delaney said . " Your phone working ? " " Yeah , " Bootsie said . " Over there . " Delaney called St. Vincent 's , identifi ed himself , asked which surgeons were on duty , and held on . His eyes moved around the club , the blood and disorder , and Eddie Corso moaning , and the sallow man guarding the door , and Bootsie nibbling at some cake left on the bar . His gaze fell on the framed photographs of prizefi ghters and ballplayers , of old picnics , feasts , weddings , and then on the browning photograph of the remnant of the battalion . In a gouged field in France . All of them were still young , the farm boys and the city rats , and he could see Eddie Corso laughing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as brave as any man Delaney had ever known . He saw himself too , off on the side , with his medic 's armband , his face gaunt , a cigarette in his good right hand . " Hello , hello , " came the voice on the phone . " This is Dr. Zimmerman . " " Thank God , " Delaney said , relieved that it was this particular young intern . " Jake , I need a big favor . " It was after eleven when Bootsie dropped him off at the house on Horatio Street . They had taken Eddie Corso through an old delivery entrance at the side of the hospital and hurried him into surgery . If he lived , there would be no records . If he died , it did n't matter . Around ten , Jake Zimmerman came out , young and bony and frazzled , and told Delaney with a nod and a thin smile that Eddie would survive . The nuns would bring him along after the operation , adhering to their own special vows of silence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd your patient get those scars ? One on the back , one on the leg ? " " The Argonne , " Delaney said . " I sewed him up . That 's why it looks so bad . " " The Argonne ? " " Yeah . " " You never told me that . " " It was a long time ago , Jake . " In another life . Now he was on Horatio Street , with the snow still blowing hard . Bootsie 's exhausted breathing had fogged the windows . Delaney opened the door . " Thanks , Bootsie , " he said . " Thank you , Doc . " Then he reached over and touched Delaney 's arm . " You 're a good fuckin ' man , Doc . " " I wish , " Delaney said , and stepped into the driving snow . He looked up at the small brick house , the one he 'd been given at her death by Evelyn Langdon . Ten years ago now , in a good year , before the goddamned Depression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to the street in the 1840s , fleeing cholera and the Irish , building their impregnable brick and brownstone fortresses . He had kept her alive until she was seventy-three . She had outlived her two children and all of her friends . When she died and the will was read , there was a note to Delaney , explaining that the house was now for him and his wife , Molly , and his daughter , Grace . You have been my last and perhaps truest friend . Please use this house to enrich human life . Well , I did try , he thought as he opened the iron front gate under the stoop , remembering Evelyn 's note . I tried , and too often failed . Most of all , I 've failed those I loved the most . Then he noticed the disturbed snow on the stoop itself , and , at the top , a fog rising on the tall glass windows of the vestibule . It was like Bootsie 's fog in the car , a streaky , uneven fog made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron banister with his good left hand . Foot marks were drifted over with fresh snow . He glanced back to the street , but Bootsie was gone . The vestibule door was unlocked . It was always unlocked , so that in bad weather the boy from Reilly 's candy store could drop off the newspapers . In the left corner , he glimpsed the Times , the News , the Mirror . Maybe the footprints belonged to the newspaper boy . Maybe . Then , pushing the door open a few inches , he saw the baby stroller . It was worn and ratty with age , strands of its wicker hood sprung and loose . Like something bought at a secondhand shop . Under a pile of covers , his head wrapped in a green scarf and a yellow wool hat , was a child . He knew this boy with the wide , wary brown eyes . He had not seen him since the boy was six days old , another unformed infant huddled in the nursery of New York Hospital . But he had his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace had let him hold the boy , saying only that the boy 's father , Rafael Santos of Cuernavaca , Mexico , was out running errands . She was not even seventeen that morning , his and Molly 's only child . Now a child with a child . Smart , gifted , spoiled , but a child . Like ten thousand other young mothers in New York . When Delaney returned to the hospital , late the next morning , she and the baby were gone . Almost three years now . The postcards came for a while . From Key West . From Cuba . Later Grace wrote a longer letter from Mexico , telling Delaney and Molly that all three Santoses had boarded a ship to Veracruz , with stops along the way . I tried calling before we left , she wrote . Nobody was home . Molly read the letter fi rst , then slapped it against Delaney 's chest . " Spoiled rotten , " she said . " By you . " There were a few more letters , cryptic or guarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else . And then the letters stopped . It was like an erasure on a charcoal drawing . Grace was there in his life , and in Molly 's , but not there . He never did meet the goddamned husband . He unlocked the inner vestibule door and wheeled the silent boy into the hall , closing doors firmly behind him . His own bedroom was to the left on the street side , the former parlor converted long ago by some forgotten inhabitant , with the former bedroom now full of chairs and couches , looking out on the back garden . Sliding oak doors separated the rooms , but the parquet floors stretched from front windows to rear like a dense oaken plain . He gently freed the boy from the blankets , thinking : Goddamned swaddling clothes . The boy had a lighter version of his mother 's dark blond hair , and he gazed up at Delaney in silence . And then Delaney saw the letter on the boy 's lap . Addressed DADDY . Sealed . He dropped it on the bed . Thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the boy . I do n't want him to see my rage . She will explain herself , of course , but I ca n't stop now . He slipped off his heavy clothes and felt a chilly dampness penetrating the room . Thinking : Build a fire . He lifted the child , breathing hard on the boy 's cold cheeks . Then the boy moved his arms . His face looked as if he had a toothache . " Mam , " he said , waving a freed hand toward the door . With an accent on the second syllable . " Mam ? " " We 'll find her , boy . Do n't worry . " " Mam ? " The boy was wearing a pale blue snowsuit with a dark blue sweater underneath , and Delaney removed it and then lifted him and placed him standing beside the bed , his feet planted on the threadbare Persian rug . Carlos . His name is Carlos . A good weight . Maybe twentynine , thirty pounds . A healthy weight . Clear skin too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy stood there , a hand on the mattress , gazing around at the strange high- ceilinged room , with its electric lights rising from the channels of old gas lamps , the dark glazed paintings on the walls , the dresser that held Delaney 's clothes . The boy was looking at the two framed photographs on top of the dresser . Delaney 's wife , Molly , when she was twenty-five . Grace , when she was sixteen , about the time she met Rafael Santos somewhere out in the city . Delaney thought : The boy has intelligent eyes . Yes . His mother 's eyes . " Mam ! " the boy said , pointing . " Mam ! " " Yes , " Delaney said , " that 's your mama . " The coals were ashen gray in the fireplace , and Delaney squatted , crumpled an old newspaper , built a small house of kindling , struck a match . He thought : What the hell is this , anyway ? I 've treated about three thousand kids this size , this age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of them . Not even for a day . I did n't even know how to take care of my own daughter when she was this boy 's age . I went to the war instead . The boy watched him , his dark eyes widening as the flame erupted . He glanced back at the photograph , then looked again at the fi re , as Delaney used a shovel to lift a few chunks of coal from the scuttle . Delaney felt his right shoulder begin to ache . Not from the cold . But he would have to do something to keep the boy warm in this large , drafty house . In the good years before the Crash , Delaney had installed a hot-water system in the house , not easy because it was built in 1840 . Before he could convert the house to steam heat , the banks had failed , taking his money with them . The heat still belonged to the nineteenth century . Wood and paper and coal in a manteled fireplace . The boy seemed to love it , flexing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed him too . But almost no restaurants would be open on New Year 's Day . Not until tonight . He must need to eat . Christ , I need to eat . Breakfast . Christ , no : lunch . (
