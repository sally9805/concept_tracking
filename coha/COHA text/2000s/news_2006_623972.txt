<p> Swollen , 20-30-foot-high waves thundered out of the northwest like a stampede of marine bulls . They snorted , steamed and rampaged across the reef at Maverick 's on Jan. 4 . <p> Grant Washburn , the break 's poet laureate and cinematic historian , says it was the fourth-most potent swell ever ridden here , producing wave faces more than 50 feet tall . <p> Ten years back , big-wave surfers on this break near Pillar Point at Half Moon Bay mostly pointed their " guns " ( boards 9 to 12 feet in length ) straight down the face , accelerated , cranked a bottom turn , raced southward in a roller-coaster ride ahead of the collapsing wave peak , kicked out and up and over the lip before it began to crash down  --  then called themselves fortunate . <p> The art of facing these shaggy sea beasts has greatly evolved . Now , hard-charging surfers use nimble boards a foot or three shorter , stay nearer the peak , make more turns , ride higher on waves and count themselves blessed if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a steepening wave wall as a pitching lip shoots over their heads to crash alongside them . <p> Jeff Clark , the pioneer who surfed Maverick 's alone for 15 years until he convinced others to join him in challenging these waves , was deep within such a tube on Jan. 4 when it abruptly constricted , then collapsed . <p> " I just got rag-dolled , " Clark said , of his swift and deep immersion in the potent hydraulics . " Suddenly , I smashed into something solid . Felt like it would rip my head right off . <p> " Only later , I realized my body had been caught in a shear zone . Between two masses of water going in opposite directions . " <p> This hints of the hidden realm of Maverick 's surfing , the forces unleashed by giant waves , and the gut-wrenching peril confronted by the " watermen " here . <p> On Jan. 7 , a gathering of 24 lean , fit men hit the beach at Pillar Point . They drove the tails of their boards into the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras snapped and swiveled . This was an opening ceremony for the 2006 Maverick 's Surf Contest , the fifth to be held at this site . The contest window will remain open until March 31 ; a " go " date will be picked on 24-hours notice if conditions seem optimal . <p> Invitees and alternates , many of the world 's top watermen , next paddled into the cove inside the reef to hold hands and form a circle . They remembered their fallen , such as Mark Foo ( killed here in 1994 ) and Jay Moriarity ( lost in a dive accident in 2001 ) , expressed glee at seeing one another , then uttered prayers and hopes for safety . <p> Despite their apparent fitness , all these surfers have taken hits of varying severity from Maverick 's thick , cold , pounding waves . They 're like matadors who have been gored once or twice or several times . Yet , gathering awareness , courage and dignity , they gird themselves in their colorful , neoprene " suits of lights , " then step once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graying at the temples , moves his stiff back as one unit , like a slab of wood . His vertebrae were hurt at a boat lift when he was a teenager . He also crushed his ribs three times at Maverick 's . Once , he was clubbed by his board during a closeout . Twice , he was simply bashed in the torso by the lip of a huge , collapsing wave . <p> Grant " The G-Man " Washburn , from the East Coast , saw San Francisco 's Ocean Beach and Maverick 's in the early 1990s , and now haunts both breaks . Standing 6-foot-5 , weighing 225 pounds , Washburn , 38 , is a broad-shouldered wedge of bone and muscle ; he looks nearly impossible to hurt . But a severe closeout in 1997 drove the board of another surfer on a Maverick 's wall into his ribs , ripping them loose from the cartilage ; they 've not been the same since then . <p> Besides delivering blows , a Maverick 's wave can bury you . Tons of falling water can drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . A classic signal of this situation is " tombstoning "  --  the very tip of the surfboard , poking up vertically , starts to wave and wiggle as the deep-driven surfer strives to shinny up his leash to reach the surface . <p> Another wave can roll in and crash upon him before he gets there . Such a " two-wave hold-down " means whatever oxygen the surfer had in his lungs during the initial plunge is all he has for the ordeal . <p> " I can hold my breath three-to-four minutes , just sitting on my couch , " Washburn said . " But you burn so much energy surfing , it 's like running around the block , then trying to hold your breath . No matter how exciting it is , you need to get your pulse rate low , make your metabolism mellow , so you do n't start with a deficit . <p> " If you do wipe out and get held under , a good trick is to pull yourself into a ball , and let your wetsuit buoyancy gradually bring you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body starves your muscles of oxygen to reserve it for heart and brain . Your fingers and arms tingle , then go numb . Pretty soon , you feel paralyzed  --  ca n't move them , even if you want to . Gets pretty grim . But you must stay relaxed , not panic , and hold on to every last scrap of air until you reach the surface . " <p> Achieving that posture , tucked into a self-protective ball with all limbs folded out of harm 's way , is not always possible . <p> Evan Slater , 34 , editorial director of Surfing Magazine , went over the falls but was caught on the surface and then took the crushing impact of the wave lip on a leg in 1998 . It ripped apart two ligaments ( the ACL and MCL ) . They were repaired with replacement tissue harvested from his thigh . Despite a long and painful convalescence , Slater is back in the lineup for the Maverick 's contest . <p> " I ca n't knee-paddle anymore , " Slater said . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same places . But I may be a little more selective about which wave I pick . " <p> Another surfer who felt the bull 's horn is Mike Gerhardt , 39 . Last January , he fell off and landed under the lip , which then crushed down on him with massive force . It pushed his arms up , popped his biceps tendon , nearly stripping away the muscle , and shredded his rotator cuff . <p> " The waves were medium high . Felt like my day , " Gerhardt said . " Got more rides than ever before . Then , I had to pay . Sooner or later , everyone pays out here . " <p> After a four-hour operation , Gerhardt , a Santa Cruz building contractor , endured months of rehabilitation . But now that he can raise his arm over his head and paddle a board once more , he 's back at Maverick 's . <p> " I have n't changed my approach . I still go after it , " Gerhardt said . " I 've surfed around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't do tow-ins ( when a surfer is launched on exceptionally large waves by a Jet Ski ) . As far as butt-kicking is concerned , Maverick 's is the world 's most powerful wave . Period . " <p> " When you paddle out here , you never know what you 're going to get , " Clark said during a brief interview at the opening ceremony . " You just know it 's going to be something really special . " <p> The Maverick 's  --  The Maverick 's Surf Contest will be held , on 24-hours notice , before March 31 , when waves and weather are suitable .  --  The easiest way to see the contest is not to go . The reef is a half-mile offshore ; the small section of bluff overlooking it is steep , muddy , and gets severely crowded ; and parking near this part of Half Moon Bay becomes overwhelmed .  --  Instead , sign up for the live Webcast , at mediazone.com , and click on " Mavericks Surf contest .
