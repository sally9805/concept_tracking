When I was a kid , my favorite book was Horton Hears a Who , and , like most kids , I wanted to hear it over and over and over again . My indulgent but increasingly frazzled father tried to substitute Horton Hatches the Egg and other Dr. Seuss books , but nothing else would do , although I did permit season-appropriate readings of How the Grinch Stole Christmas . See , I had figured out what Seuss only implied : Those Whos down in Who-ville , the ones who taught the Grinch what Christmas was all about ? Clearly they were the same Whos who lived on Horton 's flower . That realization made me giddy , a five-year-old deconstructionist , taking the text down to its bones . The word was the word , the Who was the Who . For if the Whos lived on the flower , then it followed that the Grinch and his dog , Max , did , too , which meant that the Grinch was super tiny , and that meant there was no reason to fear him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much havoc could such a tiny being wreak ? A lot , I know now . A whole lot . My name is Edgar " Crow " Ransome , and I indirectly caused a young man 's murder a few months back . I did some other stuff , too , with far more consciousness , but it'sthis death that haunts me . I carry a newspaper clipping about the shooting in my wallet so I 'll be reminded every day  --  when I pull out bills for a three-dollar latte or grab my ATM card  --  that my world and its villains are tiny , too , but no less lethal for it . Tiny Town is , in fact , one of Baltimore 's many nicknames  --  along with Charm City and Mobtown  --  and perhaps the most appropriate . Day in , day out , it 's one degree of separation here in Smalltimore , an urban Mayberry where everyone knows everyone . Then you read the newspaper and rediscover that there are really two Baltimores . Rich and poor . White and black . Ours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2300 block of East Lombard Street late last night . Police arrived at the scene after a neighbor reported hearing a gunshot in the area . Those with information are asked to call . . . This appeared , as most such items appear , inside the Beacon Light 's Local section , part of something called the " City/County Digest . " These are the little deaths , as my girlfriend , Tess Monaghan , calls them , the homicides that merit no more than one or two paragraphs . A man was found shot to death in an alley in the 700 block of Stricker Street . . . . A man was killed by shots from a passing car in the 1400 block of East Madison Street . . . . A Southwest Baltimore man was found dead inside his Cadillac Escalade in the 300 block of North Mount . If they have the victim 's name , they give it . If there are witnesses or arrests , the fact is noted for the sheer wonder of it . " Witness " is the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , if you will . We 're down on snitchin ' here in Baltimore and have the T-shirts and videos to prove it . Want to know how bad things have gotten ? There was a hit ordered on a ten-year-old girl who had the misfortune to see her own father killed . Here 's what is not written , although everyone knows the score : Another young black man has died . He probably deserved it . Drug dealer or drug user . Or maybe just in the wrong place at the wrong time , but he should have known better than to hang around a drug corner at that time , right ? If you want the courtesy of being presumed innocent in certain Baltimore neighborhoods , you better be unimpeachable , someone clearly , unambiguously cut down in the cross fire . A three-year-old getting his birthday haircut . A ten-year-old playing football . I wish these examples were hypothetical . I 'm not claiming that I was different from anyone else in Baltimore , that I read those paragraphs and wondered about the lives that preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everyone else did , plotting the city 's grid in my head , checking to make sure I was n't at risk . Shot in a movie theater for telling someone to be quiet ? Sure , absolutely , that could happen to me , although there are n't a lot of tough guys in the local art houses . Killed for flipping someone off in traffic ? Not my style , but Tess could have died a thousand times over that way . She has a problem with impulse control . But we 're not to be found along East Lombard or Stricker or Mount or any other dubious street , not at 3:00 a.m . Even when I am in those neighborhoods , people leave my ride and me alone . Usually . And it 's not because I 'm visibly such a nice guy on a do-gooding mission . They do n't bother me because I 'm not worth the trouble . I 'm a red ball walking ; kill me and all the resources of the city 's homicide division will be brought to bear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . In fact , I think I 'd get almost as much coverage as Gregory Youssef , a federal prosecutor found stabbed to death last year . Perhaps I should carry a clipping of that case , too , for it was really Youssef 's death that changed my life , although I did n't know it at the time . But I 'm not likely to forget Youssef 's death soon . Nobody is . The hard part would be fitting me into a headline . Artist ? Musician ? Only for my own amusement these days . Restaurant-bar manager ? Does n't really get the flavor of what I do at the Point , which is a bar , but increasingly a very good music venue as well , thanks to the out-of-town bands I 've been recruiting . Scion of a prominent Charlottesville family ? Even if I were confident I could pronounce " scion " correctly , I 'm more confident that I would never pronounce myself as such . Boyfriend of Tess Monaghan , perhaps Baltimore 's best-known private investigator ? Um , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not how I wish to be defined . Continues ...
