How to get over the anger and get back to love . Plus , a quiz for couples . // Caria feared her marriage was ending . She and her husband , Tim , had " stopped communicating , " as she put it , and for the last five months , things had been going downhill fast . " Everything about my husband bugs me , " she said when she came to see me . " The way he calls to check on me during the day . The way he controls our money . The fact that he expects me to take care of the kids all week , then be excited to go out for dinner with his business partners on Saturday night . We fight all the time . And we hardly touch one another . " " Has anything in your lives changed recently ? " I asked her . " Clich stuff , if anything . " " Tell me about the clich stuff , " I said . " My son started applying to colleges , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I do n't think that 's the issue . I 'm getting my real estate broker 's license , so it 's not like I 'm feeling trapped . " " No ? " She shrugged . " I was hoping for more support from Tim . I wanted to take a class , but Tim could n't promise to get my daughter to gymnastics once a week . I found some property for us to invest in , and he barely glanced at the listing sheet . " I nodded . " You want to change your life , but your husband does n't seem to be getting on board . " " He 's getting in the way . " " Let me ask you another question , " I said . " Can you picture yourself walking into a restaurant with another man , running into Tim with another woman , and chatting before you head to separate tables ? " She stared at me for a moment , then said , " That would feel awful . " " Even though " everything " about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? I ca n't stand living with him , and I ca n't imagine life without him . " It is n't weird in the least . Carla was describing what I call a " bad patch , " not a bad marriage . She was n't ready for her relationship to end . But with her children growing more independent , the roles she and Tim had played for decades now felt outdated and confining . When people feel like their marriages are holding them back , they can become a lot less loving-emotionally or physically or both . But that does n't mean the marriages are over . Nearly every married couple runs into a bad patch sooner or later . The life of a relationship unfolds as we live our lives as individuals . A marriage has to keep pace with each partners personal growth . And that 's a tall order . Imagine trying to rewrite a television drama on the fly , again and again , because one of the actors wo n't stay in character . Many factors can change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister to cancer and begins to focus on her own mortality , talking about leaving a job she hates to go back to school-a change with huge financial implications for her husband . * A man who 's always been secure is out of work for months-a change that alters his wife 's vision of him as a reliable partner . * A woman with chronic depression finally goes for treatment and experiences increased self-esteem and an increased libido . That 's great news for her and her husband-and , at the same time , a dramatic challenge to the emotional balance of their relationship . My job was to help Carla and Tim see that they had run into a bad patch that coincided with their son 's getting ready to go off to college . I wanted them to see the turmoil they 'd been living through as growing pains-the start of a new phase of their marriage , rather than the beginning of the end of it . I met with Tim , a driven man who clearly derived most of his selfesteem from his career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past several months ? " I asked him . " Depressed , to an extent , " he said . " Definitely irritable . " " True , " I said . " But it 's more than that . Her role as a full-time mom is ending . She needs a new identity . " " I told her I 'm fine with her going back to work , " he said angrily . " If she wants a career , more power to her . " I leaned forward . " Here 's the thing : Right now , you seem like a pretty good fit with the Old ' Carla , a supportive mother to your kids . You are n't used to having her focus on her own interests . So you have to change too . The question is whether you love her enough to try . " He met my gaze . " More than she knows , " he said . " How do I prove it ? " The first thing Tim did was to arrange to come home early one night a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he told Carla that making room for her career was important to him , even if cutting back on his work hours was n't exactly second nature for him . Within a month , the change in Carla and Tim 's marriage was dramatic . A great deal of Carla 's resentment evaporated . Tim was n't her jailer anymore ; he was her partner again . She felt more affectionate toward him . For his part , Tim took pride in Carla 's new knowledge of real estate , and he felt good about the time he was spending with his daughter . Not every bad patch is so easily navigated . One reason is that we tend to marry people who speak to our weaknesses , not our strengths . A woman who had a controlling father might marry a meek man who wo n't overpower her . But ten years into the marriage , when she needs support because of an emotional loss or illness or just because it would feel nice to finally let someone else take charge , it can be very difficult for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to step up to the plate . And yet by identifying the roles they play-and by talking about the issues at the core of their marriagecouples find opportunities to change or grow and live more complete emotional lives . Deep inside , we all want to rise to the challenges life presents . That 's why I tell patients like Carla that bad patches , as painful and threatening as they are , really do carry with them a chance for increased intimacy-and the very best years of a marriage .
