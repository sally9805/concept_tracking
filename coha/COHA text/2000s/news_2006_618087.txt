<p> Naomi Donaldson , 91 , leads the " Let 's Talk " group in her senior independent-living high-rise in Atlanta . She also leads a singing group , a reading group and a " Fireside Chat " group , where everyone takes turns reminiscing . <p> She exercises four times a week and takes walks , and when she finds herself in an elevator with hard floors , she does a little soft-shoe . <p> " The more you keep being involved , the happier and the healthier you are going to be , " said the former teacher and pianist . " I feel like I 'm lucky . I 'm legally blind , and I wear two hearing aids . But ... I 'm not going to let it stop me . " <p> At her age , Donaldson may be more the exception than the rule , but she 's on the leading edge of a sea change among older adults : one in which rocking chairs are out and tap shoes are in . If " 40 is the new 30 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 . And 90 , apparently , is the new 70 . <p> " There 's a larger percentage of older adults who are living well  --  they 're able-bodied into their 60s , 70s and 80s  --  who are active and cognitively alert , " said Elisabeth Burgess , associate professor of sociology at Georgia State University . <p> Older adults are beating society 's perceptions of what they " should " act like and look like . They 're breaking new ground in lifestyles , turning toward active participation instead of passive wisdom . So sometimes , they surprise even themselves . <p> " This business about being wise , I keep waiting for my wisdom to kick in , and it 's not kicking in , " joked Bill Sonenshine of Norcross , who turns 70 on July 1 . " My dad died when he was 77 and my mom died in her early 70s . And I think about that ; I 'm that age now . I do n't look 70 and I do n't act 70 . . . I feel like I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or lack thereof  --  could be caused by personal and cultural shifts , sociologists say . On average , older Americans are healthier and wealthier than previous generations . According to the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics ( www.agingstats.gov ) , the age-adjusted proportion of Americans 65 and older with a chronic disability declined from about 25 percent in 1984 to 20 percent in 1999 . The median net worth of households headed by people 65 and older increased by 82 percent ( after accounting for inflation ) between 1984 and 2001 . <p> All about variability <p> Median statistics , however , do n't tell the whole story . Not everyone is living longer or better . The net worth of black and white older adults has increased , but whites still claim the lion 's share of wealth in America . <p> In 2001 , the median net worth of older white households ( headed by people 65 and older ) was five times larger , at $205,000 , than for older black households ( $41,000 ) , according to the Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy , active older people , many people in their 70s and older are in the same shape as previous generations at that age . " How you lived at 20 , 30 , 40 impacts how you live at 80 , " Burgess said . <p> People who spent their working years in a coal mine , for instance , have many of the same health problems that their coal miner parents did , she said . " The story about older adults today is really about the variability , " said Burgess , who is graduate director of Georgia State University 's Gerontology Institute . " There are people who are 70 who are great-grandmothers , and there are people who are 70 who have n't become grandmothers yet . " <p> There are people in their 70s who volunteer their time or work part time just to stay busy , " and there are adults that age still working at Wal-Mart or McDonald 's . . . because that is how they pay their rent . " <p> Susan Hart Sandler , program director of EdgeWise for Mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunwoody , says she often gets inquiries from people in their 60s about the program , which includes lecture series , book discussions , exercise classes and social gatherings for people 50 and older . <p> But " They 're calling about their 90-year-old mother . They 're looking for their parents , not themselves , " she said . " I had one lady I was describing the program on the phone to who said , ' I do n't hang out with those old people . ' She was 85 . " <p> The variability among older adults leads to incongruities such as Sonenshine volunteering at Sunrise Senior Living at Huntcliff Summit in Atlanta , where Donaldson lives , or Bernie Lovitky , now 83 , joining the Peace Corps at age 60 . Both men also give time at the Marcus center for their intellectually active peers : Sonenshine leads a book club , and Lovitky coordinates a lecture series with his wife , Bunny . <p> The activity is n't all intellectual , either . Many older adults are physically active longer , and to a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuven is a relative youngster in his three-times-a-week tennis group , which includes players in their 80s . <p> " You look around and you see folks you know are about your own age , but they look older than you feel , " said the retired psychologist , who last month competed in the Atlanta Senior Olympics in tennis and swimming . " I do n't know if you put an age on it , but you just feel younger . " <p> The fitness trend among older adults is driven by the baby boomers , said James Dowd , sociology professor at the University of Georgia . " They came of age in the ' 60s and they lived through the fitness boom of the ' 70s , and they 've taken fitness as part of what they do . So they do look younger and remain active , " he said . " The activities this generation is engaging in are far , far different from their parents or grandparents . " <p> Societal changes <p> What is driving this emphasis on youth ? Why do boomers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to " act their age " ? <p> " We do still stereotype older adults , " Burgess said . " The baby boom generation is fighting aging as much as they are hitting the cusp of older adulthood . They 're breaking the mold . I think that that generation is consciously trying to have a different view of older adulthood and is n't ready to claim that wise-old-man or wise-old-woman status yet . " <p> It could also be that these " unwise " folks have the wisdom to recognize that wisdom is n't as respected as it once was . One hypothesis , said Dowd , is that the status of old people declines with social modernization . <p> Maybe in premodern societies , the old people that were around were the repositories of social wisdom . But what old people know may not be what we need to know , he said . Today 's older adults , he said , " are still finding their way through a changing world , and maybe they 're not feeling equipped to tell younger people how to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that wisdom is out , participation is in . <p> " Intelligence and wisdom are not as socially valued as they have been in previous generations . What 's valued is being healthy and active  --  ' As long as I 'm active and physically healthy , then I 'll be OK , ' " she said . " Of course , you can be mentally active even if your body is n't working well for you . " <p> Eventually , the realities of old age do creep in , no matter how young one feels mentally . <p> " What we see in the mirror is not what other people see . When other people begin to react to us as if we were old , it affects how we feel , " Dowd said . " Eventually I think we get clued in to how old we are just because people treat you differently . " <p> And there 's nothing like seeing your family grow to make you feel your age . <p> " I tell you what kind of gets to you is when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That gets to you , " said Sonenshine , who in addition to his book club and several book review groups also participates in an acting troupe for older adults . They perform a series of skits about parents and children . <p> " I do believe the body you ca n't help ; that 's going to deteriorate . And you just hope you can escape the mind from entering into the same type of situation , " Lovitky said . " I do seek these projects out . If I become lackadaisical and do not , I feel like I 'm going backwards . At 83 , you have n't got that much time . I do want to fulfill it all I can , to the very end . " <p> * * * <p> Attitudes on age <p> " I have 88-year-olds in this lecture series , and they ask the most inquisitive , on-target kinds of questions .

" <p>  --  Bill Sonenshine , 69 , Norcross <p> " I can tell you what is true : The people who are able and chose to stay physically active are , on average , doing better by a fair amount than those who chose not to be physically active . Intellectually , physically , emotionally , I 'm a lot better off for all of that , because I chose 30 years ago to do it .

It 's easy to tell the answer . I 've read this repeatedly , that there are two ways to grow old successfully : You exercise , and you socialize . Those are the two models I go by . I go to exercise four times a week , and I take walks . When I get in the elevator , it 's the only place I go with hard floors , and I tap dance .
