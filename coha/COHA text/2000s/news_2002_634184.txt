<p> With one month left in the regular season , thrilling races for the last playoff spots in each conference are brewing . <p> Entering the weekend , five games separated seven teams  --  the Orlando Magic , Philadelphia 76ers , Indiana Pacers , Charlotte Hornets , Miami Heat , Washington Wizards and Toronto Raptors  --  battling for the last four playoff spots in the Eastern Conference . <p> In the Western Conference , seven games separated five teams  --  the Minnesota Timberwolves , Portland Trail Blazers , Seattle SuperSonics , Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Clippers  --  fighting for the last four spots . <p> This is a great statement for parity in our league , " 76ers coach Larry Brown said . The labor contract and that luxury tax have pretty much stabilized player movement . With few exceptions , teams are not willing to get into bidding wars and run up their payrolls . " <p> Unless those teams are the Trail Blazers , Dallas Mavericks or New York Knicks , whose owners are not bashful about spending big bucks to win . But despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playoffs for the first time in 14 seasons . <p> With the Raptors and Wizards fading because stars Vince Carter and Michael Jordan have been hampered by injuries , it appears the Pacers , Hornets and Heat will fight it out for the last two spots in the East . <p> The Heat has the NBA 's best defensive numbers and the best center of the three in Alonzo Mourning . But it must do a better job of scoring now that the Hornets , who swept the Heat in the playoffs last season , have Jamal Mashburn healthy again and David Wesley on the mend from his injuries . <p> The Hornets are a lame-duck team with no home-court advantage . They are the only team in the league with a worse record at home than on the road , and they rank last in attendance . <p> There 's no doubt that these small home crowds and all this talk about the team moving to New Orleans is a distraction , " Hornets coach Paul Silas said . I know we are supposed to be professionals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their minds and play their best . But they are also human . " <p> And the numbers do n't lie . <p> While the Hornets have the problem of trying to win at home , where they were 13-18 after their victory Thursday against the Jazz , the league-leading Sacramento Kings , with their league-best 30-3 record at home , were 16-15 on the road after their upset loss Thursday to the Knicks . <p> The general rule for winning 50 games , which should be good enough to enjoy home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs , is to win 75 percent of your home games and break even on the road , " Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson said . <p> But the Kings have a major stumbling block . <p> The Kings have maybe the most talent in the league , " Bulls captain Charles Oakley said . But they still have to get by the Lakers , which they wo n't do until they attack Shaquille O'Neal , get him into foul trouble and get him out of there . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scot Pollard to rotate against him and do that . " <p> Said Webber : But when he beats on us and they do n't call the fouls , it does n't do any good . I do n't mind attacking Shaq , but not if they do n't give me the calls when he hacks me . " <p> As for the last two playoff spots in the West , the SuperSonics , Jazz and Clippers are fighting over them . The Clippers have the edge in youth and depth , but the Jazz has the edge in experience because of veterans Karl Malone and John Stockton . <p> I 'd like to see the Jazz and Clippers beat out the Sonics . A Clippers victory would be most impressive because they would have to do it without injured projected starters Lamar Odom and Corey Maggette . <p> Here are the top 15 who can help make a difference : Raef LaFrentz , Mavericks ; Travis Best and Charles Oakley , Bulls ; Tyrone Hill , Cavaliers ; Jeff McInnis , Clippers ; Rod Strickland , Jimmy Jackson and Kendall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis , SuperSonics ; Michael Redd , Bucks ; Bonzi Wells , Trail Blazers ; Mike Bibby , Kings ; Keon Clark , Raptors ; and Donyell Marshall , Jazz . <p> The 6-6 Redd is one of the most underrated players in the league . Because he plays behind high-scoring Ray Allen , Glenn Robinson , Sam Cassell and Tim Thomas , he does n't get the playing time he would on most teams . But he is the Bucks ' best three-point shooter ( 44.6 percent ) and one of the NBA 's most explosive scorers . He scored 26 points , including an NBA-record eight three-pointers , in one quarter last month . <p> I like the experience I 'm getting here , and the organization is great , " Redd said . But I 'm keeping all my options open . " <p> CHARLOTTE SHUFFLE : Fellow NBA owners are speaking out against Hornets owner George Shinn 's efforts to move his team from Charlotte , N.C. , to New Orleans . Jerry Colangelo and his NBA Relocation Committee will visit New Orleans on Wednesday . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hubris of owners just picking up and leaving , and the way that trust and confidence has been broken in that environment , it 's very unhealthy for the NBA and very unhealthy for me in Seattle , " SuperSonics owner Howard Schultz said . <p> MISSING MICHAEL : The Washington Wizards are 9-0 when Michael Jordan and Richard Hamilton score at least 20 points in the same game , but they entered the weekend 2-9 without Jordan . The two victories were against the Magic and Bulls . A Wizards source says Jordan will play again this season only if the team is no more than four victories away from the last playoff spot and there are at least 10 games left . Five of the Wizards ' last 12 games are against teams with losing records . <p> BEST DEAL : If the Pacers had not traded point guard Travis Best to the Bulls , insiders say he would have been dealt to the Cavaliers for center Michael Doleac and shooting guard Trajan Langdon . This would have upset Best because he would have backed up Andre Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs playing time because he 'll be a free agent this summer . <p> ROSE VS . MILLER : Jalen Rose would have been a better pick than Reggie Miller for the U.S. team in the World Basketball Championship this summer . Rose is a better all-around player and a superior public-relations asset . Miller has been infamous for not talking to reporters before games and for being late , rude and abrupt after them . <p> Kurt Thomas , Knicks : Maybe it 's because the 6-9 Thomas is playing center in place of injured Marcus Camby that he fouls every 4.13 minutes of playing time . He also has been disqualified eight times and has committed six technical fouls . <p> FOUL-PRONE II <p> Juwan Howard , Nuggets : A 6-9 forward , he also played a lot at center for the Mavericks before being traded to the Nuggets . He commits a foul every 3.9 minutes of playing time and also has been whistled for nine technical fouls and three flagrant fouls . <p> FOUL-PRONE III <p> Kenyon Martin , Nets : Watch out for this mean 6-9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only commits a personal foul every 3.8 minutes of playing time , he has been cited for 11 technical fouls and four flagrant fouls and has been kicked out of seven games . <p> Lakers at Spurs ( 7 p.m . Wednesday , TNT ) : Two of the NBA 's best players , the Lakers ' Shaquille O'Neal and the Spurs ' Tim Duncan , clash again . The Lakers lead the four-game season series 2-0 , including a 98-81 victory without Shaq in San Antonio . <p> STAT PACK <p> 40 <p> The league season-high number of assists the Trail Blazers had in their 132-106 rout Thursday of the Mavericks . The previous high was 39 by the Jazz and Timberwolves . <p> 28 <p> Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal attempted 28 free throws  --  the most by a player in the NBA this season  --  converted 14 and scored 40 points in a 110-102 victory Thursday against the Warriors.
