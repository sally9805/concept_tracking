<p> The quiet is broken by the territorial squeaks of prairie dogs . Buffalo lounge in prairies around the bend from pine-covered cliffs . This is land the Lakota Sioux call Paha Sapa , the Black Hills . To them , it is sacred and not for sale . <p> That 's why the Sioux , among the poorest people in America , refuse the half-billion dollars offered by the U.S. government , which has claimed ownership of this land since 1877 . <p> The Indians have a longer memory . In 1868 , the United States signed a treaty setting aside the Black Hills " for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupancy of the Sioux . " Then gold was discovered there , and Congress grabbed the land after negotiations to purchase it broke down . <p> A century later , in 1980 , the Supreme Court awarded eight Sioux tribes $106 million in compensation - the 1877 value of $17.5 million , plus interest . This was payment for what the court called " a taking of tribal property . " <p> The tribes refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . Two political efforts to return federally held land failed in the 1980s . <p> The money sits in a government account , interest having swollen it now to $570 million . Still , the Sioux wo n't touch it . They say that would be a sellout of the Lakota nation , religion and culture . <p> Nowhere is the opposition more entrenched than the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation , by some estimates the poorest place in the country . Home to the Oglala band of the Lakota Sioux , Pine Ridge has an unemployment rate of 85 percent . <p> The Oglala Sioux 's share of the award is now worth $170 million . If they invested that , they could expect around $17 million a year in income without touching the principal . The annual budget for the reservation , by comparison , is $15 million . <p> It 's money that could be used for housing , business development , job training and education , or even political pressure to get the Black Hills back . <p> Today , many people on the reservation live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place to work . Mangy dogs roam and forage . <p> The center of Pine Ridge village has a couple of gas stations , a Pizza Hut and a Taco John 's , and that 's about it . The reservation , covering 5,000 square miles , has nine villages but no banks , no car washes , no barber shops , no hotels . <p> Regardless of the obvious need , opposition to taking the money consistently runs over 90 percent in newspaper surveys , according to Tim Giago , publisher of the Lakota Journal . <p> Talk of the cash reminds the Sioux of the gold-seeking explorers who swarmed into the land seven years after President Andrew Johnson signed the Black Hills treaty . <p> The resulting military battles culminated in Custer 's defeat at Little Big Horn in 1876 . <p> " Ho-ka hey ! " yelled Crazy Horse at that battle . " It is a good day to fight ! It is a good day to die ! Strong hearts , brave hearts , to the front ! Weak hearts and cowards to the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give up the Black Hills , or lose federal food , medicine and blankets , rations pledged earlier to compensate for disrupting their hunting lands with westward expansion . Only 10 percent of the adult male Sioux population signed the treaty giving up the land , but Congress enacted it into law in 1877 . <p> A federal judge , later echoed by the Supreme Court , blasted the government 's deal , saying : " A more ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealing will never , in all probability , be found in our history . " <p> The wind can whip across Pine Ridge at 50 mph , throwing stinging bits of dirt in your mouth and the corners of your eyes , hurling tumbleweeds , swirling the plastic bags , candy wrappers and six-pack cartons that litter many of the open fields . <p> But the landscape is also striking . Wide-open skies offer 360-degree views of prairies , rolling pine-covered hills and the Badlands , carved by wind and water over millions of years . <p> Try to figure the value of the Black Hills - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that is : " Wamaka Og'naka I'cante . " <p> Tribal members have their own complex calculations of that value , but they do n't involve dollars , even half a billion . <p> " A lot of white people perceive this as foolish pride , " says tribal council member Craig Dillon . " But pride 's all we have . " <p> The SuAnne Big Crow Health and Recreation Center was named after a 17-year-old star athlete killed in a 1992 car crash . With only $32 in the bank , her mother , Chick Big Crow , started a foundation that built the center . <p> A converted plastics factory , the center includes a room with photos , trophies and jerseys of SuAnne , who exhorted her peers to avoid drugs and alcohol and once scored 67 points in a basketball game . <p> Chick Big Crow remembers the struggle to get funding early on . It 's the kind of project that would have benefited from seed money from the Black Hills bounty . But she would n't have wanted it . <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asks . <p> A 16-year-old hanging out at the center 's cafe , James Red Cloud , puts it another way . <p> " If we take that , we ai n't got nothing left . No land , and nothing to fight over , " he says . <p> A copy of the U.S. Constitution rests on the couch in Johnson Holy Rock 's trailer . He also has copies of treaties and the Supreme Court 's Black Hills decision . <p> Holy Rock , 82 , wearing a belt buckle depicting an Indian warrior , has been involved in tribal government on-and-off for decades . On his wall is a framed photograph of him with President John F. Kennedy , at the announcement of the first public housing grant to the Oglala Sioux tribe . <p> " Housing was my priority , " says Holy Rock , tribal president in the early 1960s . " Up to that point , people lived in car bodies and tin shacks . " <p> Holy Rock raises livestock , and his front porch offers a view of rolling grasslands , cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I live in a natural atmosphere , so I have visitors , sometimes even coyotes , " says Holy Rock , who was widowed six years ago . A limping German shepherd dog recently started coming around . <p> Holy Rock says the Sioux refusal to take the Black Hills money has been misunderstood . <p> " The money laying there , ready to be issued out - all we have to do is say , ' OK . ' And yet , we 've chosen to live in poverty ... just poor , ignorant , heathen savages , " he says . <p> " We have a different set of values , " he continues . " We do n't think of the air and water in terms of dollars and cents . " <p> Holy Rock grew up in a log house with no foundation ; when the house burned down , the family moved into a tent . He was 6 years old when he first started looking after his father 's livestock . <p> Water was so scarce back then that when he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same hole . To this day , he considers water such a valuable commodity that he 'll have only half a glass at a restaurant . <p> Things are not as bleak for Holy Rock anymore . <p> " I 'm comfortable , " he says . " I do n't aspire to riches . " <p> At Bear Butte , a sacred site in the northeastern Black Hills about 150 miles from Pine Ridge , prayer cloths of many colors are tied to the trees , placed there by Indians as a sign of their commitment to the creator . Today , they blow in 40 mph winds like a psychedelic parade of low-flying kites . Offering pouches , filled with sage and tobacco , also hang from the trees . <p> A road at Bear Butte State Park marked " Authorized Vehicles Only " stops outside a field where several Sioux are building a fire to heat rocks for a sweat lodge . Once inside the tarp-covered lodge , they will pray , sing and use the stifling heat to cleanse their minds and bodies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The sweat lodge will teach you everything about life , about yourself . It 's like looking at a mirror , at reality , at truth . Your shield comes down . " <p> Accepting money for this land is unthinkable , says the 52-year-old . <p> " We would be telling God , ' This is n't yours . We 're wheeling and dealing . ' " <p> Charlotte Black Elk is a descendant of Crazy Horse 's friend , Little Big Man , who in 1875 threatened to kill any man who advocated selling the Black Hills . Black Elk herself is so hardcore that she uproots non-native plants from her property . <p> Had the Supreme Court made its ruling 25 years earlier , she says , the tribes probably would have accepted the money . <p> " Each generation has become much more radicalized , " says Black Elk , a thin woman who looks younger than her 49 years . " When it came to my generation , we were , ' No , we 'll never take the money . ' " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious practices . <p> " My parents ' generation lived in a world where they were socialized Christians , and attempted to maintain as much of the tribal culture as possible , " Black Elk says . " Whereas myself , I 'm an orthodox Indian . ... I have the religion that came with my culture and my blood and the land that I 'm attached to . " <p> Both her daughter and son have killed buffalo , which helps connect them with past generations that made hunting the center of society . " My daughter 's generation is Lakota in a way that our people have n't been for 150 years , " she says . <p> Black Elk lives in the reservation village of Manderson , a few miles north of Wounded Knee , site of the 1890 massacre of nearly 300 unarmed Sioux . Her house is surrounded by limestone buttes . Elk antlers and an elk head hang on her wall . <p> She is confident that the Sioux will one day own the Black Hills again . <p> Her 28-year-old nephew , D.J . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me says we should just take the money , " says One Feather , a former reservation police officer . <p> Then why not do it ? <p> " I guess it 's pride , man , " he says . " You 're giving in to the white man . I hate using terms like that - us and them - but sometimes it 's hard to get your point across without them . Hundreds of years of oppression - you 're just giving in to it . " <p> Bill Swift Hawk , a 62-year-old artist , has made it a vocation to take over places in the name of Indian power . <p> Thirty years ago , he joined in the American Indian Movement occupation of Alcatraz , the former prison island in San Francisco Bay . In 1981 , he and others occupied Wind Cave National Park in the Black Hills . Now , Swift Hawk is part of a group occupying the reservation 's tribal government building . <p> Swift Hawk left Pine Ridge and spent his 20s and 30s in California , pretty much " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made money by shortchanging cashiers , rationalizing that he was getting his Black Hills share . <p> Alcoholism affects almost every reservation family , health officials say , yet there is no detoxification center , something the Black Hills money could pay for . <p> Swift Hawk quit booze 20 years ago , and moved back to Pine Ridge . <p> The activists occupying the government building began protesting alleged corruption in tribal government , which is millions of dollars in debt , and now call for a return to a traditional government , run by elders . <p> Inside , a shrine displays a copy of the 1868 treaty , promising the land " for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupancy of the Sioux . " <p> Exchanging that for money is just not an option , Swift Hawk says . <p> " That 's the center of our world . " <p> End Adv <p>
