Trent Hergenrader lives with his wife in Madison , Wisconsin . An avid soccer fan , he worked for the US Soccer Federation and has published articles about soccer in Play On ! and elsewhere . Since attending the Clarion workshop in 2004 , he has sold short stories to Cicada and to an anthology of stories for victims of Hurricane Katrina , but it looks as though his first story to see print will be this affecting little tale of father and son . <p> " DAD , DID YOU KNOW THERE 'S a man spying on us ? " Daniel asked , not looking up from the small collection of Tinker Toys scattered on the motel 's brown shag carpet . <p> Dr. Russell peered over the edge of yesterday 's Montreal Gazette . Still fully dressed in his customary tweed suit , he reclined on the double bed , withhis shoes angled off the side so as not to soil the already discolored comforter any further . " What do you mean , son ? " <p> " Across the street , " Daniel said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window ought to have been . It was taped over with black garbage bags . " There 's a man in the tree who watches us . " <p> Russell bit on the mouthpiece of his unlit pipe . The hotel did n't allow smoking but having something in his mouth prevented him from gnawing on what little remained of his fingernails . " Do n't be silly . The branches are dead and no one should climb it . It ca n't hold the weight of a little boy . It certainly ca n't hold the weight of a man . " <p> " No , not in the branches - in the tree . The trunk itself . He looks out the hole in the trunk . He must have dug underneath and come up inside it . " <p> " Do n't make me send you to bed early , young man , " Russell said limply . He slid his legs from the bed as if to prove the point but he had little faith the ruse would work . Daniel had precious little to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one scrolled vertically no matter how the antennae was adjusted and the other showed nothing but indistinct flickering shapes moving around the snowy picture tube - and Russell had n't brought any suitable reading material for the boy , just some lab notes and a few texts full of small print but lacking in interesting photos . Without the stimulus of toys Daniel would have nothing to do except talk , and talking inevitably led to asking questions . Russell was in no mood to answer questions this evening . He considered switching off the lights and trying to coax the boy into believing they were tired enough to sleep , but such a gesture would simply condemn them to hours of fidgeting and tossing . That would keep the boy awake and then the questions were sure to come , only this time under the cover of darkness . No , better to keep him preoccupied , playing quietly on the floor . Perhaps he could end this bit of foolishness with a gentle reprimand . " Being spied on is a serious invasion of privacy . It 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joking , " Daniel said , fitting a wooden spool on the end of a green stick . " I 'm telling the truth . You should try it sometime . " <p> Russell felt a prickling sensation across his scalp as he broke into a sweat . " Damn it , Daniel . Now you 've upset me . " He half-folded , half-crumpled his paper and tossed it on the nightstand and opened the drawer . He removed the vinyl-covered Gideon Bible and thumped it ominously against his palm . <p> Daniel 's face drooped in disappointment . " Dad , this is no time for spankings or sermons . It 's time for the truth . You go first . How old am I ? " He spoke with a weary tolerance Russell recognized well , a tone he had heard often in his own voice the few times he had been exposed to children . <p> " You 're six years old . " <p> " Fine . I 'll go first , then . I broke the window on purpose . " <p> " You what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what you 're feeling . " Russell 's head began to throb . Dr. Specie 's Baby and Child Care lay somewhere at the bottom of his duffel bag but he could n't go digging for it now . Besides , Dr. Spock had never studied a child like Daniel . The boy did n't fit the same mold as other children . <p> " The window , " Daniel said patiently , pointing again to the plastic bags billowing inward with the breeze . " I broke it on purpose . " <p> " Why would you do something like that ? " Russell felt a sharp pang in his stomach and envisioned an ulcer exploding like a geyser . He felt he might be ill . He unbuttoned his collar and set his pipe on the nightstand . " That nearly got us expelled from this motel , and I 'm still responsible for the repairs . Why would you do such a thing ? " A thought occurred to him and he took a deep breath . Russell fumbled for the note pad and pen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed timbre ; softer , more pleasant , he hoped . " Are you angry about something ? " He scribbled through the motel 's garish logo to get the ink flowing . <p> " I broke it because of the man in the tree . He has a machine . I saw him testing it on the room next to ours . He points it at a window and the machine decodes the glass 's vibrations . He can tell what they 're saying . So I threw my baseball through our window so he could n't do that . " <p> " Nonsense , " Russell said weakly . " We 're talking about you now , Daniel . This is very important . What 's going through your head ? " He poised the pen . <p> Daniel sighed . Wordlessly , he lifted the flimsy chain of Tinker Toys onto the bed . Most boys would have built things - houses , trucks , maybe a space ship - with the various pieces , Russell supposed , but Daniel had n't . The boy 's creation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a caterpillar or snake . Daniel held his hands around it as though it was a house of cards that might blow over and , when he was satisfied it was n't going to fall apart , he sat back on his heels . <p> " What do you have there ? " Russell asked , hoping the toy could serve as some surrogate Rorschach . <p> " A scientist should know , " Daniel said irritably . " That 's my dinner . " <p> " What do you mean ? You already had dinner . Enough games , Daniel , my head hurts and I - " <p> " What did I eat ? " Daniel interrupted . <p> " I do n't remember . " He tried to remember the meal they 'd had just a few hours ago at the dingy diner connected to the motel . He tried looking at the construction with a boy 's imagination , or with what he perceived a boy of six 's imagination might be , but he soon shook his head in defeat . He had no idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head with finality and was going to speak when an image sprung to mind and , in that second , Russell understood everything . There was no use denying it any longer . Just like so many times in the lab , he 'd been overthinking the problem ; the answer now appeared so obvious he was shocked he did n't recognize it sooner . Perhaps it was because he did n't want to recognize it sooner . He put the pen down and pinched the bridge of his nose . <p> Daniel spoke first . " It 's a molecular model of a complex carbohydrate , similar to the spaghetti I had for dinner . I could also map out the pasta sauce , meatballs , and other ingredients , but I think I 've made my point . " <p> " Yes , Daniel , you have , " he said in a low voice . <p> " So ... how old am I ? " <p> " Two years , nine months , three weeks , four days , " he glanced at the clock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused . " Daniel , answer me this . What 's the square root of nine hundred sixty-one ? " <p> " Thirty-one , " Daniel responded immediately . <p> " And the approximate area of ... let 's say Bahrain ? " <p> " Two hundred sixty-two square miles . " The boy answered as though he 'd been asked his favorite flavor of ice cream . <p> A moment of silence separated them . <p> " Pick up your things . We should go , " the doctor said as he pulled a red spool off the model . His hands paused . Would the boy even have any use for toys anymore ? He tossed the spool next to the container on the floor . Daniel could decide . <p> " Because of the man in the tree ? " <p> " Yes , because of the man in the tree . Let 's go , " Russell said . He dashed to the bathroom counter and swept their toiletries into the wastebasket , then removed the plastic liner . He twisted the top and threw it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched as Russell worked his hands and paced the L-shaped corridor between the bed and the wall . Russell snatched his pipe and a half-eaten roll of antacids from the nightstand and hurriedly dropped them in the bag . <p> " If we go now , they 'll probably kill us . " <p> Russell 's hand froze as it reached for the car keys on top of the television set . An icy bead of sweat trickled down his side . " What did you say ? " <p> " If we rush out of here , they 'll know something is wrong and they 'll kill us . Or just you , probably . " <p> Russell left the keys on the television and faced Daniel . " May I ask you another question ? " <p> " Of course , Dad , " he said cheerily . <p> " Should we kill the man in the tree across the street before we go ? " <p> Daniel paused . " No , I do n't think so . First , we do n't have any instrument to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for combat and could fend off an attack from a scientist and a child . Third , we could n't sneak up on him while we 're under surveillance and besides , approaching him would signal that we 're aware of his presence and he would call in backup . I ca n't see us succeeding in an attempt to kill him so it 's pointless to ponder whether his theoretical death would help our theoretical escape . " <p> " You did n't mention the moral consequences of our actions , Daniel , " the doctor said gently . Or did that even matter now ? <p> " Are you suggesting that Piaget 's theory of children 's moral development is - " <p> " No , Daniel , I 'm not suggesting anything , " Russell cut him off . Theoretical escape . Russell felt his chest tighten . " One more question , quickly if you would . " <p> " Certainly . " <p> " When did you learn these things ? When did you first become aware that you knew these things ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around four-thirty . It just came on , like a television . Like when you first turn it on , the tube is dark for a few seconds and you can just hear voices , but a second later the picture snaps into view and everything becomes clear . It was like that . " <p> " Why did n't you say something earlier if you 've been like this all day ? " <p> " They were listening , of course . I was throwing my baseball up in the air and catching it . Then I felt funny for a moment , and that 's when I realized I could calculate the trajectory of each throw . Then I noticed the man was in the tree . It took a few minutes but I finally understood what he was doing . So , as naturally as I could , I threw the ball through our room 's window . You talked to the manager immediately afterward and then we went for an early dinner while he taped up the window . And you remember the trucker in the diner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of them . " <p> Russell blinked . The trucker had fallen into the booth adjoining theirs with a heavy thud , causing him to spill his coffee into its saucer . <p> " So was the woman with the blue eye shadow snapping her bubblegum and the beatnik in the green beret at the counter . They were all part of the team . In fact , I think only the waitress and the short-order cook were n't . They were so conspicuous I thought you suspected something but you just did n't want to scare me . Did n't you notice me giggling ? " <p> " Yes , but I thought .... " I thought you were just being a normal little boy , he thought . " Quickly now , Daniel , how much do you know ? We have n't much time . " <p> " Well , I 'm guessing there 's some device embedded in the frontal lobe of my cerebral cortex . I say that because I do n't have any enhanced motor skills . " <p> " That 's correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . Continue , please , " Russell said . <p> " I 'm assuming there 's been some sort of informational download or perhaps a preloaded memory cache wired to my brain , since none of this knowledge is experiential . Before I even know I have a question , I seem to have an answer for it . It 's like having a library frontloaded inside my head . " <p> " It 's much more than a library , Daniel . How much do you remember of your childhood ? " <p> " I have no memories of a mother-figure , " he said flatly . " I remember the lab but my memories cut in and out . I remember you . You were always there . You were always nice to me . I remember being wrapped in a blanket one night and being placed in a car . The wool blanket felt rough against my face . That next morning you drove us across the border . You swore at the long customs lines . " <p> " Yes , " Russell said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do next ; a part of him wished he had an implant to help him decide . The plastic over the window rustled . A fly pinged incessantly inside the light fixture . <p> " They thought the device did n't work ? " Daniel asked . <p> " They thought the device did n't work , " Russell echoed . <p> " They were probably going to dispose of me then , right ? Start over from scratch ? " He spoke without emotion . <p> Russell could find no words . He could only shake his head . <p> " It 's okay , Dad , I know it was n't you . I appreciate what you did . Besides , I understand that failed experiments need to be destroyed . They can be dangerous . I 'm sure you broke a few dozen protocols sneaking me out of there . I do n't understand why you did it . " <p> Tears blurred Russell 's vision and it took a moment before he could master his voice . " Because I cared for you very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . You have no idea how long I fought for you and I knew we were close , and the thought of them taking my boy away was too much to bear . I felt the implant might yet function if we gave it time , but then I began to fear what would happen if it did suddenly work . I did n't want them using you like some vile tool . So we fled and not a moment too soon , apparently . I never dreamed they 'd find us so soon . But for what it 's worth , I think you 're wrong , Daniel . If they catch us they 'll be upset , but they wo n't murder me for what I 've done . " <p> " Oh , they would n't , " Daniel said with a sudden look of surprise . " But they 're not the ones with the man in the tree . These are Russians . " <p> Russell nearly swallowed his tongue . " Russians ? What are you talking about ? " <p> The boy shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannerisms and body language are all quite distinct . They 're Russians . What more can I say ? " <p> " This is impossible . We 've got to get out of here . " Russell grabbed the duffel bag , inspected the contents , and threw it on the bed . He surveyed the room shaking his head . <p> " Dad , wait .... " <p> " Forget packing , we 'll just be off .... " <p> " Dad , wait .... " <p> Russell hurried to the phone and put the receiver to his ear . " I 'll call the lab and tell them what 's happening . They can contact the appropriate government agencies .... " <p> " You 're wasting your time , " Daniel said , and something hard in his voice made Russell stop , his finger poised over the rotary dial . " They 've probably tapped the phone by now and besides , that 's an international call . They 'll never let it go through . " <p> " To the manager 's office , then . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just cut the phone lines and kill him , too . " <p> " Out the bathroom window . " Russell could hardly recognize the frantic , high-pitched voice as his own . His heartbeat drummed in his ears . <p> Daniel shook his head . " Someone 's bound to be back there . They wanted to be absolutely sure they had the right man . That 's why they were all at the diner . I 'm guessing they 've been discussing contingency plans before executing . They should be here any minute . " <p> Russell slammed the receiver into the cradle hard enough to make the bell ring . " Damn it , damn it , Daniel , " he shrieked . " Why did n't you tell me sooner ? Why did n't you give us a chance to escape ? " <p> " Because , " he said , jutting out a quivering bottom lip . " It was n't going to do any good . They had us . I did n't want anyone else getting hurt . " A tear streaked down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time with you as I could . I love you , Dad . I 'm going to miss you . " <p> Russell swooned and put a sweaty hand on the wall to balance himself . His face felt numb . <p> Daniel 's head turned at the sharp rap on the door but Dr. Russell 's eyes stayed fixed on the boy . <p> IMG
