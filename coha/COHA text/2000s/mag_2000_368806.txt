There are times when less would not be more , when it would just be regrettably ... less . Umberto Eco has argued , for example , that Casablanca works because it evokes every convention of the romantic-adventure genre . If it had missed even one or two of them , he suggests , it would have been just another forgettably routine wartime movie . <P> That idea applies neatly to Men of Honor . It is one of those dramas of peacetime military service in which a determined individual attains what he wants  --  in this case , master-chief rank and to be a master diver in the U.S. Navy  --  and in the process surmounts his own shortcomings and the completely predictable prejudice and near deadly hostility of the brass . <P> Inspired ( a word that is bound to make realists queasy ) by the real-life story of a man named Carl Brashear , who is played by Cuba Gooding Jr. , the film is feverish in its desire to reduce his experiences to a compendium of cliches . Carl is , to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy in 1948 , when the military is officially desegregated yet still confines men of his race to the galley . But he sees Navy divers being heroic and decides to join their ranks . <P> Diving school is commanded by a god-like lunatic ( Hal Holbrook ) who never leaves his tower office but knows what he hates , which is a black man striving for elite status . All but one of Carl 's barracks mates move out rather than sleep in the same room with him . Day-to-day training is under the command of Billy Sunday ( Robert De Niro ) , a drunken , brawling redneck who , if he ca n't drive Carl out of school , would just as soon kill him . <P> But that 's just the beginning . In need of help with his book learning , Carl wins the support of the dubious local librarian ( an appealing Aunjanue Ellis ) . Can love and marriage be far behind ? Not in this movie . Will Carl attain his goal and Billy 's reluctant respect ? Why are we bothering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leg is shattered in an accident . The Navy wants him to retire . Instead he orders the leg amputated , thinking a prosthesis will be less of a handicap to him on duty . We may never have seen courage expressed in quite that way , but it 's also an excuse to bring a sobered-up Billy back to help Carl prove to a review board that he can return to active service . This , naturally , he does , presumably with the thanks of a grateful nation . <P> By now , you would think that even a nation with the U.S. 's uncanny taste for inspirational improbability might be fed up with Men of Honor . But that may not be so . There 's something refreshing about its utterly unembarrassed embrace of the familiar . The director , George Tillman Jr. , either does n't notice or does n't give a hoot about the way Scott Marshall Smith 's script piles up cliches . He just keeps driving his movie right on through them . What 's true of him is true of his actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of psychopathy , where menace and comedy very effectively coexist . But it is Gooding who does the most to redeem the movie , tempering his determination with a patient sweetness and casually stated masculine conviction that 's thoroughly winning . To borrow a phrase , " Here 's looking at you , kid . " <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
