Chapter One " Why are you so scared of me ? " Sebastian asked softly . She shifted away as if she planned to move down a step and then bolt . He could n't let that happen , not before he understood what had brought on this outburst . " Wilhelmina , talk to me . " He placed a hand on the wall , blocking her escape down the stairs . She glared at him with more anger and more of that uncomfortable fear . " You can bully your mortal conquests , " she said , her voice low . " But you ca n't bully me . " Sebastian sighed . " My earlier behavior to the contrary , I do n't want to bully you . Or anyone . " " You ca n't seduce me , either , " she informed him . " I do n't ... " Seduce her ? Was that what all this was about ? " Do you want me to seduce you ? " he asked with a curious smile . Maybe that was the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , the sound abrupt and harsh . " Hardly . I just told you that I did n't want you to seduce me . " " No , " he said slowly . " You told me I ca n't . That sounds like a challenge . " Irritation flared from her , blotting out some of the fear . " Believe me , I 'm so not interested . " He raised an eyebrow at her disdain . " Then why do you care about me being with that blonde ? " " That blonde ? " she said . " Is hair color the way youidentify all your women ? It 's got to be a confusing system , as so many of them have the same names . " He studied her for a minute , noting that just a faint flush colored her very pale cheeks " Are you sure you do n't want me to seduce you ? " he asked again , because as far as he could tell , there was no other reason for her to care about the identification system for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raspy and appealing in a way it should n't have been . Sebastian blinked . He needed to stay focused . This woman thought he was a jerk , that should n't be a draw for him . " Why did you say those things ? " he asked . " What have I done to make you think I 'm so terrible ? " Her jaw set again , and her midnight eyes locked with his . " Are you going to deny that you 're narcissistic ? " He frowned . " Yes . I 'm confident maybe , but no , I 'm not a narcissist . " She lifted a disbelieving eyebrow at that . " And you are going to deny egocentric , too ? " " Well , since egocentric is pretty much the same as narcissistic , then yes , I 'm going to deny it . " Her jaw set even more , and he suspected she was gritting her teeth , which for some reason made him want to smile . He really was driving her nuts . He liked that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , but he did like the fact that he seemed to have gotten under her skin . " I think we can also rule out vain , too , " he said , " because again that 's pretty darn similar to narcissistic and egocentric . " He smiled slightly . Her eyes narrowed , and she still kept her lips pressed firmly together-their pretty bow shape compressed into a nearly straight line . " So you see , " he continued , " I think this whole awful opinion that you have formulated about me might just be a mixup . What you thought was conceit , which is also another word for narcissism , " he could n't help adding , " was just self-confidence . " His smile broadened , and Wilhelmina fought the urge to scream . He was mocking her . Still the egotistical scoundrel . Even now , after she 'd told him exactly what she thought of him . He was worse than what she 'd called him . He was ... unbelievable . " What about depraved ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " What about it ? " he asked , raising an eyebrow , looking every inch the haughty , depraved vampire she 'd labeled him . " Are you going to deny that one , too ? " she demanded . He pretended to consider , then shook his head . " No , I wo n't deny that one . Although I 'd consider myself more debauched than depraved . In a very nice way , however . " He grinned again , that sinfully sexy twist of his lips , and her gaze dropped to his lips . Full , pouting lips that most women would kill for . But on him , they did n't look the slightest bit feminine . What was she thinking ? Her eyes snapped back to his , but the smug light in his golden eyes stated that he 'd already noticed where she 'd been staring . She gritted her teeth and focused on a point over his shoulder , trying not to notice how broad those shoulders were . Or how his closeness made her skin warm . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushing hers , his large body nearly surrounding her in the small stairwell . His closeness , the confines of his large body around hers , should have scared her , but she only felt ... tingly . " So , now that we 've sorted that out , " he said softly . " Why do n't we go back to my other question ? " She swallowed , trying to ignore the way his voice felt like a velvety caress on her skin . She did n't allow herself to look at him , scared to see those eyes like perfect topazes . " Why are you frightened of me , Mina ? " Because she was too weak , she realized . Because , despite what she knew about him , despite the fact that she knew he was dangerous , she liked his smile , his lips , those golden eyes . Because she liked it when he called her Mina . Because she could n't forget the feeling of his fingers on her skin . She started as his fingers brushed against her jaw , nudging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Golden topazes that glittered as if there was fire locked in their depths . Once again she was reminded of the ill-fated moth drawn to an enticing flame . She swallowed , but she could n't break their gaze . " You do n't have to be afraid of me , " he assured her quietly . Yes , she did . God , she did . ( Continues ... )
