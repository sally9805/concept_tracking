The day started out like so many others for U.S. counterinsurgency forces in Afghanistan : monitoring the airwaves for enemy communications . From the southeastern part of the country , the U.S. picked up a signal from the phone of a small-time Taliban commander , Mullah Wazir , whose band was suspected of ambushing road crews in an effort to halt reconstruction of the pitted Kabul-to-Kandahar highway . When Wazir 's phone flickered to life , the U.S. traced it to a mud-walled fortress near the town of Ghazni . The U.S. command at Bagram air base outside Kabul quickly dispatched an A-10 Warthog fighter plane , able to lay down enough fire to decimate a small army . <P> What the eavesdroppers had no way of knowing on Dec. 6 was that Wazir was long gone . He had left his sat-phone behind , and according to Afghan security officials , a local laborer had apparently switched it on . Outside Wazir 's house , nine children were shooting marbles in the dirt . Around 10:30 a.m. , villagers saw the Warthog circle once over the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing what villagers said were 35 explosive rounds . Each was powerful enough to destroy a tank . The children were in the pilot 's field of attack . There was little left of them except the marbles , a few shredded prayer caps and small pools of blood . <P> Just hours earlier , U.S. forces made a similar blunder , killing six other children along with two adults , members of a village family in neighboring Paktia province . That raid was supposed to take out a powerful clergyman named Mullah Jalani , who was accused by the Pentagon of operating training camps for mujahedin , hiding a sizable arsenal inside his stockade and firing at U.S. troops with what officials call a " crew-served machine gun . " But many question why Jalani had been targeted . Just two days before , he had been drinking tea and cracking jokes with the pro-U.S. governor of the provincial capital , Gardez . Special-forces teams that operate out of a fortress near Gardez maintained a hands-off policy toward Jalani . They say he might have set up illegal roadblocks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they do n't regard him as a terrorist . Later , local security officials said , U.S. forces were surprised when orders came to target Jalani . During the three-hour air and ground assault , the wall of a house collapsed on the eight victims . U.S. spokesmen said the damage was caused by secondary explosions from the hidden arsenal . But villagers told TIME that a U.S. bomb hit the wrong house , 50 yards from the militant 's . And one villager said Jalani escaped in a burqa when the U.S. troops allowed women to leave his compound before bombing it . <P> Among the number of Afghan casualties inflicted by the U.S. , the mistaken killing of 15 children stands out . " We are very angry , " says Ghulab Khan , a local farmer observing the row of eight rocky graves in Paktia . The incidents are bound to inflame anger at American soldiers and the pro-U.S . President , Hamid Karzai . The deaths embarrassed U.S. military commanders struggling to bring security and normality to the country , and deepened worries among Afghan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterinsurgency methods . " It shows the need for better coordination , " said Foreign Ministry spokesman Omar Samad , " and that we need to look at the intelligence-gathering process . "
