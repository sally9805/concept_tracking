So you love to paint ... or sew ... or hike ... or you 've got some other interest-and you 've always wondered whether it should play a bigger part in your life . That 's what Denise Mabilog dreamed about-a lot . Here 's how she finally learned to live her passion , and how you can do the same . by Laura Berman Fortgang " I 've always loved taking pictures , " 41-year-old Denise Mabilog told me . A shutterbug since age 8 , Denise wanted to study photography in college and even dreamed of having a career in the field . But the schools her family could afford did n't have photography programs ; she majored in English literature instead . Still , after college , she clung to her dream by working as a wedding photographer 's assistant . But because the job never led to actually taking photos , she quit , put her dream behind her , and moved on to corporate sales . She did n't find that fulfilling either , so after years of hearing from family and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good lawyer , she went to law school . She 's been an attorney for 14 years . Denise appreciates the challenges and the security of her career , and she 's proud of her legal expertise . Yet this Swedesboro , NJ , mom never stopped yearning to pursue photography . Her fantasy-which she 'd thought was too pie-in-the-sky to even consider-was to create a name for herself as a photographer . A more attainable goal , she felt , was to take time off to travel and shoot wonderful pictures . But she never got around to doing anything about it . What with a job , a husband , and a 7-year-old son , she asked herself , Who has time ? But when Denise read about the chance to have someone ( me-a life coach ) guide her to achieving her dream , she decided to go for it . She knew that giving weekly progress reports to someone who expected results was the push she needed to get photography back into her life . That was our starting point . STEP 1 Reawaken your dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself time and permission to take pictures for the pure pleasure of it , which would also help her develop her skills and explore whether photography would fit into her future . She was game , but felt guilty about making this dream a priority-particularly because her husband of 10 years , Norman , 39 , a chef , rolled his eyes every time she mentioned how excited she was about pursuing this passion . " I 'd like to think it 's not true that Norman is against this , " she said . " I want him to be interested ! " Her husband 's ambivalence could have become a serious obstacle for Denise , so I strongly recommended that she talk to him about it . When she did , the truth came out : Norman felt that a hobby would take away from the precious little weekend time the couple shared with their son , Ethan . Once Denise reassured her husband that her photography projects would n't elbow out their family life , he stopped being grumpy about her plans . " A big weight has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigh of relief . " It 's one less thing to worry about . " So Denise plunged in and brought all her lawyerly logic and research skills to her quest . She scoured the Internet to learn how to hone her talent and understand the ins and outs of a possible future as a serious photographer , which she finally allowed herself to imagine . And she invested in some helpful books . One was called Photographer 's Market , another had legal " release " forms for her photo subjects ( the lawyer in her knew she 'd need permission to use people 's images in print ) , and the last covered how to make money in the business . While doing her research , Denise discovered a local arts festival that was inviting applicants to display their work . That was a wake-up call . To submit an application-or pursue any kind of photographic direction-she realized she needed samples of her work . Denise did n't have much to show , so I gave her the assignment of picking a " story " -a theme , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She chose women-owned businesses in her town , and the growth of Woolwich Township , a rural area that was experiencing urban sprawl . Denise exploded with enthusiasm . " This is making me happy , " she said . " I enjoy it so much that I take my camera out in the yard and look for things I had n't seen before . " STEP 2 Look for opportunities . The next time Denise and I talked , she had big news . She 'd decided to try to take pictures for local publications to grow her photography portfolio . She did n't have much luck getting editors to return her calls until she mentioned her passion for picture-taking to Al Stecher , the owner of her local garden center . Turns out Al had a friend who worked at the local paper . Denise called this staffer , who led her to the editor-in-chief . She explained her background and asked about the possibility of freelancing-for free , so she could gain the experience . Two weeks later , the business editor asked Denise to shoot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on the back page of the front section of the Gloucester County Times was Denise 's first professional photograph-in full , beautiful color . Just weeks into pursuing her passion , she was published ! " I could n't believe two hours went by when I was on that assignment-it felt like five minutes ! " said Denise . " I 'm amazed at the progress I 've made in such a short time ! " Norman lit up with surprise when she showed him her work in the newspaper . " Did you get a couple of copies ? " he exclaimed . But just as Denise felt herself getting carried away with excitement , she 'd smack herself with a dose of lawyer 's logic and wonder what the point was of even trying to make a go of photography . So she and I spent a couple of sessions focusing on the " art of possibility " instead of being a slave to reason . She had to recognize that she was holding herself back by believing she was obligated to create something practical , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real " artist would . Now reenergized , Denise checked out more options for pursuing her dream . She added nature photography to her list because it could dovetail with her desire to take travel-related pictures . She got back on track with the story project we 'd originally discussed . And she made arrangements to visit the New Jersey Shore with her family to have a new environment to shoot in ( Norman and Ethan agreed to pose for pictures ) , and planned a trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania to do nature photography . STEP 3 Reach out . With a growing body of work and a published picture , Denise really felt that things were moving in the right direction . Having all this great news to share made her realize that she 'd told very few people about her dream-not even her own father . She 'd also hidden her passion from her coworkers because she had n't felt ready to reveal her artistic interests to them , and because she did n't think that talking to others about it was important . Chances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret is often a way of not committing to it . True , sharing your dreams can make you vulnerable ; after all , it 's embarrassing if you fail , and it 's easy to feel foolish if others do n't respond positively to your ideas . What most people do n't realize , though , is that sharing your dream can bring on good things . People might lead you to opportunities or help you to be more focused by keeping you true to your own word . After I encouraged Denise to let her secret out , she told her dad about her photography goals and invited him on her trip to the Poconos . She also decided to have a cocktail party and photo show in her home where friends , family , and coworkers would be introduced to her work . This was a huge step for Denise-essentially , she 'd be laying out her most intimate thoughts and wishes for all to examine . Denise did n't stop there . In preparation for the show , she booked a four-day trip to Santa Fe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online photography class . All the while , she interviewed photographers and researched grant money for the field because she was becoming more and more serious about her hobby . As she reflected on how far she 'd come with her dream , Denise told me , " It 's fitting into my life and not affecting my son or husband . I 've given up any little television I was watching before and I do n't spend as much time shopping for clothes and things to make me feel good , the way I used to . I 've also stopped my usual three-mile-a-day runs , but that 's okay for now . " In fact , pursuing her dream enhanced Denise 's family time . " It 's actually giving us more to do together , " she explained . " My son , who 'd been concerned that I 'd be too busy for him , even went with me to take pictures together on a lazy Sunday ; we just stopped the car whenever we saw something that we wanted to shoot . And Norman is painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What an act of love . " STEP 4 Strut your stuff . The big day arrived : On a sunny Sunday afternoon , Denise put her photos on display . Norman had cooked up some fabulous food , and he and Denise had spent countless hours hanging up framed prints of Santa Fe , the Poconos , the beach , and shots of trees and leaves she 'd taken for her online class . They even hung new curtains . Ethan , too , was excited when he saw all the careful prep work . And what did the guests think ? " Their mouths were hanging open ! " said Denise . " They were blown away . " One of her former bosses from earlier in her career was practically moved to tears . " Your stuff is amazing , " she said . She even bought five pieces off the walls when the party was over ! Denise was now a paid artist ! Another friend , the owner of an activity bakery called Gingerbread Kids , said she wanted to display some of Denise 's photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia-and that she 'd offer them for sale there . " It was truly one of the most memorable days I 've ever had , " Denise said , with a satisfied sigh . Her former boss 's parting words kept ringing in her ears : " You have to quit your job and do this right now ! You have got to give this a shot . " That was a big stamp of approval to end Denise 's big day . STEP 5 Put your hobby to the career test . Denise was on a high . She felt so free and happy since she 'd started working on her dream . She decided to keep riding that positive wave by entering one of her nature shots in a local photography contest sponsored by the Gloucester Soil Conservation District . The theme of the contest was " environmental , " which included landscapes and waterscapes . She also continued to toy with the idea of turning her hobby into a career . Having spoken to freelance photographers , she knew that entering that field would be tough , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ? should , should , should take more pictures , ' and now I 've done everything I 've been saying I wanted to do , " she told me . " I ca n't help thinking about pursuing it as a career , but would it still be this much fun if I did ? Also , could I earn enough-and if I could n't , would we be okay ? " she wondered . To sort things out , I asked her to think about her needs and values . Denise compared what her current job versus a photography career could offer her in terms of money and satisfaction . She learned that what she needs most is to have freedom in her schedule , relative peace and order , financial security , and to be right about her decisions ( as an attorney , she argues for what she feels is right , and she likes being right-as do most lawyers ! ) . What she values most is fairness ( another appeal of practicing law ) , having creativity in her life , experiencing nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering her needs and values , she saw that the combination of her law career and her passionate hobby as a photographer makes her happy . " I just do n't think I have to make more of it than it is right now . The bottom line is . I do n't want to change my whole life . My job allows me to travel so that I can have my hobby . If I were struggling financially , I could n't do that . Time will tell if this will be okay for me as just a hobby . " STEP 6 Spread the passion to the rest of your life . I 'm so optimistic now-life seems better in every way , " Denise said . " I 'm happy . I always have taking pictures to look forward to , and that keeps me going all day . It 's even helped me approach my legal work with new determination . " Then came more cause for celebration : She won second place in the photo contest she 'd entered ! The prize was a $25 gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to hear that , not for the prize itself , but because it was a validation of what I was trying to accomplish , " she said . Motivated by her success , she enrolled in her second online photography class and is planning to enter another photo contest . As we said good-bye . Denise was off on a business trip to San Francisco-and she 'd blocked off some time to take pictures while she was there . What 's your dream ? Are you ready to make it happen ? Tell us about it !
