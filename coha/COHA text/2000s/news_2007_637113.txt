<p> THE Grapevine : City seeks new game for Dome <p> * Atlanta Sports Council president Gary Stokan will head to this week 's ACC spring meetings with one mission : bring more college football to the Georgia Dome . Stokan said he 'll try to convince an ACC or SEC team to move one of its home games to Atlanta , beginning in 2008 . " In an age where some schools have seven or eight home games , it can make a lot of sense , " he said . The precedent has been set as Florida State moved its Sept. 29 home game with Alabama to Jacksonville for what athletics director Dave Hart said was an " attractive financial situation . " Hart said he plans to meet with Stokan in Amelia Island , Fla. , and would be interested in playing in Atlanta . <p> * Among the official items on the ACC agenda : a discussion about the future of the league championship game .

The goal : Find 1,000 alumni who will contribute $2,500 apiece over a five-year period . " We 're at a crossroads , " athletics director Ed Murphy said . " The door is partly open , and we have to push it the rest of the way . " The team currently plays at Grisham Stadium , at Carrollton High .

I was able to be a more compassionate person for being around her . " CHAN GAILEY , Georgia Tech " My mother was married to a coach and always had three meals ready to go . She washed all the ball clothes for four boys , and we even brought home clothes of our friends to wash sometimes . That was n't fair , but she always did it with a smile on her face .
