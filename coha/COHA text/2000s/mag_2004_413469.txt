Richie 's face burned from the embar- rassment of losing the Lee School Spelling Bee to Susie . The june heat hung like a cloud over his head . Susie acted like such a know-it-all , and he hated watching all the kids making a fuss over her . // CLAAANG went the bell at last . Richie dashed for the door . he hopped over the blue seat of his ten-speed racer and slammed down hard on the pedals . This was the day to open Grandma 's Christmas present . // Each year Richie saved one package from Christmas . Sometimes he forgot about the present for weeks , but it was there when he needed it . Like now . Last year Richie had saved Uncle John 's present . Richie opened it on the day his bicycle had been stolen . The huge box contained an envelope . Tucked inside the card was a check with a note that read , " Use this to pick out a new tenspeed bicycle . " It was as if someone special knew what had happened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his driveway , Richie spotted his little brother , Andy . " Hi , Richie , " called Andy grinning . " Will you play catch with me ? " " Get lost , Squirt . You hardly know how to catch a ball , " snapped Richie . He did n't stop to see the tears in Andy 's eyes . " Hello , dear , " called his mother as he trudged into the house . Just my luck , thought Richie . Now Mom will want to know about the spelling bee . " How was school today ? " his mother asked . " Awful , " he answered , " and I do n't want to talk about it . " Richie grabbed a handful of oatmeal cookies and scaled the stairs two at a time . he ran into his bedroom and slammed the door . Then he lay down on the floor and made himself as flat as a Frisbee . Richie wriggled his way under the bed and groped along the floor until his hand touched the sharp corner of the box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . he wiggled out from under the bed like a fish swimming backward . // For a few moments , Richie stared at the box with its golden ribbon and shiny red paper . The smiling snowman label read : To Richie , with love from Grandma . he closed his eyes tightly . Richie could smell the gingerbread cookies Grandma baked just before Christmas-funny little men that he decorated with white icing and raisin eyes . Richie could feel the bite of the cold wind as he shoveled snow from Grandma 's walk . Afterward he and Grandma would sample the cookies . // Suddenly a buzzing in Richie 's ear jolted him from his Christmas memories . He opened his eyes and brushed the mosquito away from his face . Richie 's hands trembled as he gingerly shook the box . Nothing moved . he decided to open the gift downstairs . His mother and Andy sat together in the rocking chair . " You must have had a very bad day at school , " said his mother . " It 's a good idea to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a little Christmas love right now . " Richie looked at Andy 's tear-streaked face . Andy stared at him . " I 'm sorry I yelled at you , " said Richie . " I was in a very bad mood because of Susan , the Spelling Bee Brat . " " I 'm sorry you lost the spelling bee , " said Mom , " but I do n't think you should blame other people when you hurt someone 's feelings . " Richie got the message . " Hey , Andy , would you like to open Grandma 's present ? " Andy grabbed the box and ripped the wrappings to shreds . " Easy does it , " Richie laughed . Andy lifted the lid and pulled out mounds of snowy white tissue paper . " Oh , boy ! " shouted Richie . " It 's a brand-new mitt and a baseball . " He slipped the mitt onto his left hand and palmed the ball . Then Richie slowly breathed in the smell of the leather . " This is great , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the playoff this Saturday . My old mitt felt a little tight , but I do n't have enough money to buy a new one . " Then he looked at his mother . " Well , I might have lost the spelling bee , but with this new mitt and some practice , I might help my team win the game . I 'm going to try my best and not be such a poor sport next time I lose . " // " I 'm proud of your new attitude , " said his mother . " You have grown up a lot today . " Richie looked at Andy and said , " I could use someone to help me practice . You can have my old mitt . Would you play catch with me ? " " Sure , " said Andy with a grin . " I can help you win ! " <p>
