This comic-book fund raiser collects more than 60 black-and-white vignettes about Sept. 11 into 208 pages . Most are indie artists ' personal accounts of that day , like Evan Forsch 's escape from the 89th floor of the north tower . With profits going to various charities , comic books like this  --  including Marvel 's Heroes and September 11 , a two-volume set jointly published by DC and others  --  are providing both an artistic outlet and a way to help . <P>  --  By Andrew D.
