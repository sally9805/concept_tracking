When Mel Gibson began looking for influential ministers to endorse his controversial film , The Passion of the Christ , high on his list was the Rev. Rick Warren , founding pastor of the Saddleback Church in Lake Forest , Calif . ( Warren loved the movie , reserved blocks of seats at local cinemas for his parishioners and on two weekends last month delivered sermons on the Passion and plans another one for Easter . ) When the White House wanted advice on how to observe the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks , aides called Warren to meet with the President , the First Lady and West Wing staff members , many of whom have dog-eared copies of his best-selling book The Purpose-Driven Life . <P> Movie stars and political leaders are n't the only ones turning to Warren for spiritual guidance . Over the past 17 months , 15 million copies of The Purpose-Driven Life have been sold . And since it was published in 1995 , an additional 1 million copies of The Purpose-Driven Church have been snapped up as well . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have participated in Warren 's pastor-training seminars and Internet classes , and more than 10,000 churches of various denominations have offered his 40 Days of Purpose group-study course . Beyond the chapel , millions of people  --  from the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour members to Coca-Cola executives to high school students to prison inmates  --  meet regularly to discuss Warren 's belief that the only way to discover who you are and what you 're living for is to divine God 's purpose for you . <P> The first line of the first chapter of The Purpose-Driven Life puts it bluntly : " It 's not about you . " Explains Warren : " Looking within yourself for answers does n't work . If it did , we 'd know it by now . As with any complex invention , to figure out your purpose , you need to talk to the inventor and read the owner 's manual  --  in this case , God and the Bible . " <P> The widespread appeal of this philosophy suggests that Warren just might be , as Christianity Today has declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly less exalted view of his role . Says Warren : " I 'm translating the truth into 21st century language , and evidently a lot of people are listening . " He 's convinced that the nation is on the verge of a spiritual awakening , as people seek fulfillment they do n't get in fast-track jobs and ca n't buy with gold cards . " The culture is asking , ' How do I fill this hole in my heart ? ' " he says . " I think religion has the answer . " <P> Warren found his own purpose at the end of 1980 , when he was the young minister of a 150-member congregation that had no church home and held services in whatever high school gym he could rent . Disillusioned and burned out from trying to keep his flock together , Warren collapsed in the middle of his sermon one Sunday and fell into a depression . He spent the next year soul-searching for a way to meet all his obligations without getting overwhelmed again . " I needed to figure out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest , " says Warren , 50 . " I wanted to be guided by purpose and not pressure . " Through prayer and Bible study , he rediscovered the Christian doctrines that formed his blueprint for " living a life of purpose and meaning .
