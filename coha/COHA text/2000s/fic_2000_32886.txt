The storm came from the south . It was predicted , but even if it had n't been , Summer VanVorn would have sensed its approach . She did n't know why that was , whether a sudden drop in the barometric pressure affected her blood , but it had always been so . With the approach of a storm , she was inevitably out of sorts . This one came up the Atlantic coast , her portable radio told her . It did n't touch land long enough to weaken , but created havoc on nearly every offshore island along the way . The Isle of Pride was in its path , which was unusual enough to explain why Summer was taken off guard . Oh , she had felt it coming . She had experienced the faint vibrating inside , the ultrasensitivity to touch , the fever-like warmth of her skin , but she had been convinced that this hurricane , like so many before it , would veer off to sea and die well before it reached Maine . Then again , perhaps she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . August was when she sailed to VanVornland . Like Pride , VanVornland was an island , though an uninhabited one with not so much as the crudest dirt road or log cabin or stone wall . To Summer 's knowledge , it was n't on any map but was , rather , her family 's secret . Particularly now that she was the last living VanVorn , the two weeks she spent there each year were a balm . Had it not been for mundane needs of the flesh , such as food , clothes and shelter when winter came , and the less mundane need to tend the meadow where the ponies of Pride grazed , she might have lived there year-round . This time Summer should have left sooner . She knew it within an hour of setting sail for home . The sky grew progressively darker , and the vibrations inside her picked up along with the wind , such that before long her hands ached trying to hold in the sails . But she did n't allow for slack . Time was of the essence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took eight hours . She was hoping to make it in six , which was about all she estimated she had before the storm hit in full . Before another hour had passed , she realized that she had been overly optimistic . The storm was upon her , racing head-on beneath a swirl of angry clouds . She pulled a windbreaker over her jersey and shorts , plaited her long blond hair with elastic bands , tied down everything in sight and braced herself as the wind rose . In an attempt to protect herself from the spray of the sea , she sank lower in the boat . Still she was soaked to the skin before another hour had passed . She was also frightened . She had sailed in bad weather before , but never in weather like this . It was all she could do to hold the rudder steady and keep the sloop headed due west . Sail home , Summer , sail home , she commanded . The ponies are alone . They may need you . But no amount of determination and grit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the storm . When the rains came , colluding with the wind to churn the sea and whip the boat furiously about , she had no choice but to lower the sails . She huddled beneath them , intent on riding out the storm . She did n't know how long she stayed there , wet and cold at the base of the mast while the boat rolled and heaved . When waves topped the gunwales and poured inside , she set one hand to bailing and held on for dear life with the other . Then , with an ominous crack , the mast split in two , and her fear approached panic . The boat listed toward where the broken mast lay , drawing in water so quickly that bailing was absurd . Grabbing the cushion on which she 'd been kneeling , she barely had time to thread her arms through its straps when a fierce wave knocked her to the floorboards . She felt a stab of pain , but it was forgotten in the next instant when , with a terrifying yawing sound , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . She sank in the chilly North Atlantic , emerging seconds later gasping and frantic . The hull of the boat lurched in the waves not far from her . She tried to reach it , but was beaten back , coughing , again and again until , as though taking pity on her , the sea gave her a backhanded toss toward the sloop . She hit the wooden hull with a cruel thud . Ignoring a cutting pain , she hauled herself up on the keel . There she lay , with her head pressed to the wet wood , while the rain pelted her and the wind and the waves dared her to ease her hold for so much as a second . That was all it would take , she knew . One second , and she 'd be lost . Hold on , Summer . Hold on . She thought of the ponies in the meadow . She thought of the small cabin nearby , where her mother had raised her and where she still lived . She thought of the harpsichord and her flute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she played the sweet music in her mind so that she would n't have to hear the roar of the wind and the waves . Inevitably , she weakened . Her limbs grew numb from the cold and the strain of holding on , and the pain in her head and side worsened until breathing was an effort . Dizzy , she lost her grip . She clawed at the keel and regained it , but no sooner was she atop the boat when she felt herself slipping again . This time the world went white and silent . When she came to , the buoyant cushion was gone , she was flailing her way to the surface , then gasping for air , and her boat was nowhere in sight . She whirled around in the water but could n't see it . She opened her mouth to cry out her anguish , only to have it filled with water before any sound emerged . She sank and surfaced choking , unable to get enough air . Then something touched her . Too defined to be a whale or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasped her waist and hauled her to the surface . " Breathe , " it yelled . She fought , first against the arm that restrained her , then , when she realized the arm would n't drag her under again , for air . The yelling went on , the voice male and strong . " That 's it . A little at a time . You 'll be all right now . You 're safe . " His legs worked behind hers , holding their heads above the waves . " My boat ! " she sputtered . " Gone , " he yelled . Shifting her to his back , he fastened her arms around his neck . " You 'll have to hold on . Can you do that ? " She nodded against his head , suspecting that it was less a case of holding on as being unable to let go now that her arms were in place . More numb than ever , she lay limply while he began to swim . Thoughts came in spurts . How could he keep them afloat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he know where to go ? Where was his boat ? She faded in and out , aware one minute , unaware the next . She knew she was trembling , but the sensation was distant . In fact , everything felt distant , even , now , the danger . She did n't know how he did it , but her rescuer was moving them steadily through the waves . He kept swimming without tiring , his body exuding equal amounts of purpose and strength . Totally depleted of the latter , Summer had no choice but to put her fate in his hands . She was only semiconscious when she felt a change in the rhythm of his stroke . Forcing herself awake , she looked through the wind and rain to see massive dark boulders looming ahead . At nearly the same instant , her swimmer drew her around , lifted her in his arms and strode out of the water . " I 'm home ! " she managed in astonishment . She did n't understand . She was sure that the Isle of Pride had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How did you ? " " We were n't as far away as you thought , " he said in a voice that was deep and hoarse . He carried her across the ribbon-thin beach and set her down on the wet sand beneath the shelter of a granite overhang . The rain blew in , but his broad back and shoulders deflected it . He bent his head toward hers . " How do you feel ? " " Numb , " she answered , but she was shaking in earnest . He slid a wet hand under the dripping plait of her hair , curving it supportively to her neck . " You 're in shock . You need to be warm and dry . Where do you live ? " Her teeth were chattering , though she was n't aware of being cold . What she was aware of was that this man was a stranger and that she did n't have men , strange or otherwise , in her home . Ever . She did n't trust them . But this one had saved her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't sure she could make it home on her own . In apprehensive bursts , she said , " I live up island . Fifteen minutes ' walk . There 's a path down the beach . It leads to a road . " The words were barely out when he lifted her in his arms again and set off . She knew he had to be dead tired and wondered where he found his strength . Without missing a step , he found the path and , holding her even closer to his chest to shield her from the storm , climbed it.At the road at the top , he leaned into the wind and headed home . For the first time in her life , Summer wished one of the islanders would drive by . But the chances of that were next to nil . After battening down the hatches , they would be staying put until the storm passed . They had no reason to budge . After all , they did n't fear for the trees in the meadow where the ponies grazed . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beeches , easily come by , easily lost . Summer knew better . Those broad leaves contained critical nutrients . If the beeches went , the ponies were doomed . Unable to even consider that possibility , she closed her eyes and focused on the man who carried her . His arms were strong , his hold oddly comforting . Knowing Pride 's landscape like the back of her hand , she tracked his progress in her mind 's eye . " There 's a road ahead , " she managed at one point , though it was an effort to make herself heard above the wind . " Go to the end . Then turn left . " The storm raged unabated . With unflagging stamina , he shouldered his way through it . Summer knew she should tell him to put her down , thank him , leave him and go on alone , but she did n't think she could walk . Pain was breaking through her numbness , most of it involving her knee . She had to tend to it , and for that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and onto her path , she forced herself to full awareness . " Stop here . I have to check the meadow . " " Not now . " " But there may be damage . " " Until the storm stops , you ca n't do a thing . Besides , you 're hurt . " She tried to deny it . " I 'm all right . Really I am . " Ignoring her , he carried her up the cabin steps and inside . With the closing of the door on the storm , its cacophony was abruptly muted . Carefully , he set her down on the cushiony sofa . " First a fire , " he said and turned to the large stone hearth . Summer pushed herself up . Fighting a wave of dizziness and a harsh twinge in her middle , she tried to stand . Her knee screamed in pain , the sound echoing up through her throat . In an instant , the man was beside her , pressing her back . His voice was as gentle as his hands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had a chance to see what 's wrong . " He took the wool afghan that had been folded over the sofa back and started to cover her but she pushed it quickly away . Continues ...
