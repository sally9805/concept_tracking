A Series of Unfortunate Events #10 : The Slippery Slope Chapter One A man of my acquaintance once wrote a poem called " The Road Less Traveled , " describing a journey he took through the woods along a path most travelers never used.The poet found that the road less traveled was peaceful but quite lonely , and he was probably a bit nervous as he went along , because if anything happened on the road less traveled , the other travelers would be on the road more frequently traveled and so could n't hear him as he cried for help . Sure enough , that poet is now dead . Like a dead poet , this book can be said to be on the road less traveled , because it begins with the three Baudelaire children on a path leading through the Mortmain Mountains , which is not a popular destination for travelers , and it ends in the churning waters of the Stricken Stream , which few travelers even go near . But this book is also on the road less traveled , because unlike books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about charming people and talking animals , the tale you are reading now is nothing but distressing and unnerving , and the people unfortunate enough to be in the story are far more desperate and frantic than charming , and I would prefer to not speak about the animals at all . For that reason , I can no more suggest the reading of this woeful book than I can recommend wandering around the woods by yourself , because like the road less traveled , this book is likely to make you feel lonely , miserable , and in need of help . The Baudelaire orphans , however , had no choice but to be on the road less traveled . Violet and Klaus , the two elder Baudelaires , were in a caravan , traveling very quickly along the high mountain path . Neither Violet , who was fourteen , nor Klaus , who had recently turned thirteen , had ever thought they would find themselves on this road , except perhaps with their parents on a family vacation . But the Baudelaire parents were nowhere to be found after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had reason to believe that one parent may not have died in the blaze after all  --  and the caravan was not heading up the Mortmain Mountains , toward a secret headquarters the siblings had heard about and were hoping to find . The caravan was heading down the Mortmain Mountains , very quickly , with no way to control or stop its journey , so Violet and Klaus felt more like fish in a stormy sea than travelers on a vacation .... A Series of Unfortunate Events #11 : The Grim Grotto Chapter One After a great deal of time examining oceans , investigating rainstorms , and staring very hard at several drinking fountains , the scientists of the world developed a theory regarding how water is distributed around our planet , which they have named " the water cycle . " The water cycle consists of three key phenomena  --  evaporation , precipitation , and collection  --  and all of them are equally boring . Of course , it is boring to read about boring things , but it is better to read something that makes you yawn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound your fists against the floor , and leave tearstains all over your pillowcase , sheets , and boomerang collection . Like the water cycle , the tale of the Baudelaire children consists of three key phenomena , but rather than read their sorry tale it would be best if you read something about the water cycle instead . Violet , the eldest phenomenon , was nearly fifteen years old and very nearly the best inventor the world had ever seen . As far as I can tell she was certainly the best inventor who had ever found herself trapped in the gray waters of the Stricken Stream , clinging desperately to a toboggan as she was carried away from the Valley of Four Drafts , and if I were you I would prefer to focus on the boring phenomenon of evaporation , which refers to the process of water turning into vapor and eventually forming clouds , rather than think about the turmoil that awaited her at the bottom of the Mortmain Mountains . Klaus was the second eldest of the Baudelaire siblings , but it would be better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitation , which refers to vapor turning back into water and falling as rain , rather than spending even one moment thinking about the phenomenon of Klaus 's excellent skills as a researcher , and the amount of trouble and woe these skills would bring him once he and his siblings met up with Count Olaf , the notorious villain who had been after the children ever since their parents had perished in a terrible fire . And even Sunny Baudelaire , who had recently passed out of babyhood , is a phenomenon all to herself , not only for her very sharp teeth , which had helped the Baudelaires in a number of unpleasant circumstances , but also for her newfound skills as a cook , which had fed the Baudelaires in a number of unpleasant circumstances . Although the phenomenon of collection , which describes the gathering of fallen rain into one place so it can evaporate once more and begin the entire tedious process all over again , is probably the most boring phenomenon in the water cycle , it would be far better for you to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several boring days reading every single boring fact you can find about collection , because the phenomenon of what happens to Sunny Baudelaire over the course of these pages is the most dreadful phenomenon I can think of , and I can think of a great many .... A Series of Unfortunate Events #12 : The Penultimate Peril Chapter One Certain people have said that the world is like a calm pond , and that anytime a person does even the smallest thing , it is as if a stone has dropped into the pond , spreading circles of ripples further and further out , until the entire world has been changed by one tiny action . If this is true , then the book you are reading now is the perfect thing to drop into a pond . The ripples will spread across the surface of the pond and the world will change for the better , with one less dreadful story for people to read and one more secret hidden at the bottom of a pond , where most people never think of looking . The miserable tale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murky depths , and you will be happier not to read the grim story I have written , but instead to gaze at the rippling scum that rises to the top of the world . The Baudelaires themselves , as they rode in the back of a taxi driven by a woman they scarcely knew , might have been happy to jump into a pond themselves , had they known what sort of story lay ahead of them as the automobile made its way among the twisting streets of the city where the orphans had once lived . Violet , Klaus , and Sunny Baudelaire gazed out of the windows of the car , marveling at how little the city had changed since a fire destroyed their home , took the lives of their parents , and created ripples in the Baudelaires ' lives that would probably never become calm . As the taxi turned a corner , Violet saw the market where she and her siblings had shopped for ingredients to make dinner for Count Olaf , the notorious villain who had become their guardian after the fire . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme to get his hands on the enormous fortune the Baudelaire parents had left behind , the market looked the same as the day Justice Strauss , a kindly neighbor and a judge in the High Court , had first taken them there . Towering over the market was an enormous , shiny building that Klaus recognized as 667 Dark Avenue , where the Baudelaires had spent some time under the care of Jerome and Esme Squalor in an enormous penthouse apartment . It seemed to the middle Baudelaire that the building had not changed one bit since the siblings had first discovered Esme 's treacherous and romantic attachment to Count Olaf . And Sunny Baudelaire , who was still small enough that her view out the window was somewhat restricted , heard the rattle of a manhole cover as the taxi drove over it , and remembered the underground passageway she and her siblings had discovered , which led from the basement of 667 Dark Avenue to the ashen remains of their own home . Like the market and the penthouse , the mystery of this passageway had not changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as V.F.D. that the children believed had constructed many such passageways . Each mystery the Baudelaires discovered only revealed another mystery , and another , and another , and several more , and another , as if the three siblings were diving deeper and deeper into a pond , and all the while the city lay calm on the surface , unaware of all the unfortunate events in the orphans ' lives . Even now , returning to the city that was once their home , the Baudelaire orphans had solved few of the mysteries overshadowing them . They did n't know where they were headed , for instance , and they scarcely knew anything about the woman driving the automobile except her name . " You must have thousands of questions , Baudelaires , " said Kit Snicket , spinning the steering wheel with her white-gloved hands . Violet , who had adroit technical faculties  --  a phrase which here means " a knack for inventing mechanical devices "  --  admired the automobile 's purring machinery as the taxi made a sharp turn through a large metal gate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wish we had more time to talk , but it 's already Tuesday . As it is you scarcely have time to eat your important brunch before getting into your concierge disguises and beginning your observations as flaneurs ... Continues ...
