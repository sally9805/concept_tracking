1664 My mother did not tell me they were coming . Afterwards she said she did not want me to appear nervous . I was surprised , for I thought she knew me well . Strangers would think I was calm . I did not cry as a baby . Only my mother would note the tightness along my jaw , the widening of my already wide eyes . I was chopping vegetables in the kitchen when I heard voices outside our front door-a woman 's , bright as polished brass , and a man 's , low and dark like the wood of the table I was working on . They were the kind of voices we heard rarely in our house . I could hear rich carpets in their voices , books and pearls and fur . I was glad that earlier I had scrubbed the front steps so hard . My mother 's voice-a cooking pot , a flagon-approached from the front room . They were coming to the kitchen . I pushed the leeks I had been chopping into place , then set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron and pressed my lips together to smooth them . My mother appeared in the doorway , her eyes two warnings . Behind her the woman had to duck her head because she was so tall , taller than the man following her . All of our family , even my father and brother , were small . The woman looked as if she had been blown about by the wind , although it was a calm day . Her cap was askew so that tiny blond curls escaped and hung about her forehead like bees which she swatted at impatiently several times . Her collar needed straightening and was not as crisp as it could be . She pushed her gray mantle back from her shoulders , and I saw then that under her dark blue dress a baby was growing . It would arrive by the year 's end , or before . The woman 's face was like an oval serving plate , flashing at times , dull at others . Her eyes were two light brown buttons , a color I had rarely seen coupled with blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but could not fix her attention on me , her eyes darting about the room . " This is the girl , then , " she said abruptly . " This is my daughter , Griet , " my mother replied . I nodded respectfully to the man and woman . " Well . She 's not very big . Is she strong enough ? " As the woman turned to look at the man , a fold of her mantle caught the handle of the knife I had been using , knocking it off the table so that it spun across the floor . The woman cried out . " Catharina , " the man said calmly . He spoke her name as if he held cinnamon in his mouth . The woman stopped , making an effort to quiet herself . I stepped over and picked up the knife , polishing the blade on my apron before placing it back on the table . The knife had brushed against the vegetables . I set a piece of carrot back in its place . The man was watching me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , angular face , and his expression was steady , in contrast to his wife 's , which flickered like a candle . He had no beard or moustache , and I was glad , for it gave him a clean appearance . He wore a black cloak over his shoulders , a white shirt , and a fine lace collar . His hat pressed into hair the red of brick washed by rain . " What have you been doing here , Griet ? " he asked . I was surprised by the question but knew enough to hide it . " Chopping vegetables , sir . For the soup . " I always laid vegetables out in a circle , each with its own section like a slice of pie . There were five slices : red cabbage , onions , leeks , carrots , and turnips . I had used a knife edge to shape each slice , and placed a carrot disc in the center . The man tapped his finger on the table . " Are they laid out in the order in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , studying the circle . " No , sir . " I hesitated . I could not say why I had laid out the vegetables as I did . I simply set them as I felt they should be , but I was too frightened to say so to a gentleman . " I see you have separated the whites , " he said , indicating the turnips and onions . " And then the orange and the purple , they do not sit together . Why is that ? " He picked up a shred of cabbage and a piece of carrot and shook them like dice in his hand . I looked at my mother , who nodded slightly . " The colors fight when they are side by side , sir . " He arched his eyebrows , as if he had not expected such a response . " And do you spend much time setting out the vegetables before you make the soup ? " " Oh no , sir , " I replied , confused . I did not want him to think I was idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . My sister , Agnes , was peering round the doorpost and had shaken her head at my response . I did not often lie . I looked down . The man turned his head slightly and Agnes disappeared . He dropped the pieces of carrot and cabbage into their slices . The cabbage shred fell partly into the onions . I wanted to reach over and tease it into place . I did not , but he knew that I wanted to . He was testing me . " That 's enough prattle , " the woman declared . Though she was annoyed with his attention to me , it was me she frowned at . " Tomorrow , then ? " She looked at the man before sweeping out of the room , my mother behind her . The man glanced once more at what was to be the soup , then nodded at me and followed the women . When my mother returned I was sitting by the vegetable wheel . I waited for her to speak . She was hunching her shoulders as if against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hot . " You are to start tomorrow as their maid . If you do well , you will be paid eight stuivers a day . You will live with them . " I pressed my lips together . " Do n't look at me like that , Griet , " my mother said . " We have to , now your father has lost his trade . " " Where do they live ? " " On the Oude Langendijck , where it intersects with the Molenpoort . " " Papists ' corner ? They 're Catholic ? " " You can come home Sundays . They have agreed to that . " My mother cupped her hands around the turnips , scooped them up along with some of the cabbage and onions and dropped them into the pot of water waiting on the fire . The pie slices I had made so carefully were ruined . I climbed the stairs to see my father . He was sitting at the front of the attic by the window , where the light touched his face . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tile painter , his fingers still stained blue from painting cupids , maids , soldiers , ships , children , fish , flowers , animals onto white tiles , glazing them , firing them , selling them . One day the kiln exploded , taking his eyes and his trade . He was the lucky one-two other men died . I sat next to him and held his hand . " I heard , " he said before I could speak . " I heard everything . " His hearing had taken the strength from his missing eyes . I could not think of anything to say that would not sound reproachful . " I 'm sorry , Griet . I would like to have done better for you . " The place where his eyes had been , where the doctor had sewn shut the skin , looked sorrowful . " But he is a good gentleman , and fair . He will treat you well . " He said nothing about the woman . " How can you be sure of this , Father ? Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? " " No . " " Do you remember the painting we saw in the Town Hall a few years ago , which van Ruijven was displaying after he bought it ? It was a view of Delft , from the Rotterdam and Schiedam Gates . With the sky that took up so much of the painting , and the sunlight on some of the buildings . " " And the paint had sand in it to make the brickwork and the roofs look rough , " I added . " And there were long shadows in the water , and tiny people on the shore nearest us . " " That 's the one . " Father 's sockets widened as if he still had eyes and was looking at the painting again . I remembered it well , remembered thinking that I had stood at the very spot many times and never seen Delft the way the painter had . " That man was van Ruijven ? " " The patron ? " Father chuckled . " No , no , child , not him . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife . You 're to clean his studio . " To the few things I was taking with me my mother added another cap , collar and apron so that each day I could wash one and wear the other , and would always look clean . She also gave me an ornamental tortoiseshell comb , shaped like a shell , that had been my grandmother 's and was too fine for a maid to wear , and a prayer book I could read when I needed to escape the Catholicism around me . As we gathered my things she explained why I was to work for the Vermeers . " You know that your new master is headman of the Guild of St. Luke , and was when your father had his accident last year ? " I nodded , still shocked that I was to work for such an artist . " The Guild looks after its own , as best it can . Remember the box your father gave money to every week for years ? That money goes to masters in need , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see , especially now with Frans in his apprenticeship and no money coming in . We have no choice . We wo n't take public charity , not if we can manage without . Then your father heard that your new master was looking for a maid who could clean his studio without moving anything , and he put forward your name , thinking that as headman , and knowing our circumstances , Vermeer would be likely to try to help . " I sifted through what she had said . " How do you clean a room without moving anything ? " " Of course you must move things , but you must find a way to put them back exactly so it looks as if nothing has been disturbed . As you do for your father now that he can not see . " After my father 's accident we had learned to place things where he always knew to find them . It was one thing to do this for a blind man , though . Quite another for a man with a painter 's eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got into bed next to her that night she remained silent , though she did not turn her back to me . She lay gazing at the ceiling . Once I had blown out the candle it was so dark I could see nothing . I turned towards her . " You know I do n't want to leave . I have to . " Silence . " We need the money . We have nothing now that Father ca n't work . " " Eight stuivers a day is n't such a lot of money . " Agnes had a hoarse voice , as if her throat were covered with cobwebs . " It will keep the family in bread . And a bit of cheese . That 's not so little . " " I 'll be all alone . You 're leaving me all alone . First Frans , then you . " Of all of us Agnes had been the most upset when Frans left the previous year . He and she had always fought like cats but she sulked for days once he was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , and had never before known a time when Frans and I were not there . " Mother and Father will still be here . And I 'll visit on Sundays . Besides , it was no surprise when Frans went . " We had known for years that our brother would start his apprenticeship when he turned thirteen . Our father had saved hard to pay the apprentice fee , and talked endlessly of how Frans would learn another aspect of the trade , then come back and they would set up a tile factory together . Now our father sat by the window and never spoke of the future . After the accident Frans had come home for two days . He had not visited since . The last time I saw him I had gone to the factory across town where he was apprenticed . He looked exhausted and had burns up and down his arms from pulling tiles from the kiln . He told me he worked from dawn until so late that at times he was too tired even to eat . " Father never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered resentfully . " He always said his apprenticeship was the making of him . " " Perhaps it was , " I replied . " It made him what he is now . " When I was ready to leave the next morning my father shuffled out to the front step , feeling his way along the wall . I hugged my mother and Agnes . " Sunday will come in no time , " my mother said . My father handed me something wrapped in a handkerchief . " To remind you of home , " he said . " Of us . " It was my favorite tile of his . Most of his tiles we had at home were faulty in some way-chipped or cut crookedly , or the picture was blurred because the kiln had been too hot . This one , though , my father kept specially for us . It was a simple picture of two small figures , a boy and an older girl . They were not playing as children usually did in tiles . They were simply walking along , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had thought of us as he painted it . The boy was a little ahead of the girl but had turned back to say something . His face was mischievous , his hair messy . The girl wore her cap as I wore mine , not as most other girls did , with the ends tied under their chins or behind their necks . I favored a white cap that folded in a wide brim around my face , covering my hair completely and hanging down in points on each side of my face so that from the side my expression was hidden . I kept the cap stiff by boiling it with potato peelings . I walked away from our house , carrying my things tied up in an apron . It was still early-our neighbors were throwing buckets of water onto their steps and the street in front of their houses , and scrubbing them clean . Agnes would do that now , as well as many of my other tasks . She would have less time to play in the street and along the canals . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched curiously as I passed . No one asked where I was going or called out kind words . They did not need to-they knew what happened to families when a man lost his trade . It would be something to discuss later-young Griet become a maid , her father brought the family low . They would not gloat , however . The same thing could easily happen to them . I had walked along that street all my life , but had never been so aware that my back was to my home . When I reached the end and turned out of sight of my family , though , it became a little easier to walk steadily and look around me . The morning was still cool , the sky a flat grey-white pulled close over Delft like a sheet , the summer sun not yet high enough to burn it away . The canal I walked along was a mirror of white light tinged with green . As the sun grew brighter the canal would darken to the color of moss . Frans , Agnes , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sticks , once a broken tile-and imagine what they might touch on the bottom-not fish , but creatures from our imagination , with many eyes , scales , hands and fins . Frans thought up the most interesting monsters . Agnes was the most frightened . I always stopped the game , too inclined to see things as they were to be able to think up things that were not . There were a few boats on the canal , moving towards Market Square . It was not market day , however , when the canal was so full you could n't see the water . One boat was carrying river fish for the stalls at Jeronymous Bridge . Another sat low on the water , loaded with bricks . The man poling the boat called out a greeting to me . I merely nodded and lowered my head so that the edge of my cap hid my face . I crossed a bridge over the canal and turned into the open space of Market Square , even then busy with people crisscrossing it on their way to some task-buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baker 's , taking wood to be weighed at the Weigh House . Children ran errands for their parents , apprentices for their masters , maids for their households . Horses and carts clattered across the stones . To my right was the Town Hall , with its gilded front and white marble faces gazing down from the keystones above the windows . To my left was the New Church , where I had been baptized sixteen years before . Its tall , narrow tower made me think of a stone birdcage . Father had taken us up it once . I would never forget the sight of Delft spread below us , each narrow brick house and steep red roof and green waterway and city gate marked forever in my mind , tiny and yet distinct . I asked my father then if every Dutch city looked like that , but he did not know . He had never visited any other city , not even The Hague , two hours away on foot . I walked to the center of the square . There the stones had been laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each point aimed towards a different part of Delft . I thought of it as the very center of the town , and as the center of my life . Frans and Agnes and I had played in that star since we were old enough to run to the market . In our favorite game , one of us chose a point and one of us named a thing-a stork , a church , a wheelbarrow , a flower-and we ran in that direction looking for that thing . We had explored most of Delft that way . One point , however , we had never followed . I had never gone to Papists ' Corner , where the Catholics lived . The house where I was to work was just ten minutes from home , the time it took a pot of water to boil , but I had never passed by it . I knew no Catholics . There were not so many in Delft , and none in our street or in the shops we used . It was not that we avoided them , but they kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were expected not to parade their faith openly . They held their services privately , in modest places that did not look like churches from the outside . My father had worked with Catholics and told me they were no different from us . If anything they were less solemn . They liked to eat and drink and sing and game . He said this almost as if he envied them . I followed that point of the star now , walking across the square more slowly than everyone else , for I was reluctant to leave its familiarity . I crossed the bridge over the canal and turned left up the Oude Langendijck . On my left the canal ran parallel to the street , separating it from Market Square . At the intersection with the Molenpoort , four girls were sitting on a bench beside an open door of a house . They were arranged in order of size , from the oldest , who looked to be about Agnes ' age , to the youngest , who was probably about four . One of the middle girls held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably already crawling and would soon be ready to walk . Five children , I thought . And another expected . The oldest was blowing bubbles through a scallop shell fixed to the end of a hollowed stick , very like one my father had made for us . The others were jumping up and popping the bubbles as they appeared . The girl with the baby in her lap could not move much , catching few bubbles although she was seated next to the bubble blower . The youngest at the end was the furthest away and the smallest , and had no chance to reach the bubbles . The second youngest was the quickest , darting after the bubbles and clapping her hands around them . She had the brightest hair of the four , red like the dry brick wall behind her . The youngest and the girl with the baby both had curly blond hair like their mother 's , while the eldest 's was the same dark red as her father 's . I watched the girl with the bright hair swat at the bubbles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white tiles set diagonally in rows before the house . She will be a handful , I thought . " You 'd best pop them before they reach the ground , " I said . " Else those tiles will have to be scrubbed again . " The eldest girl lowered the pipe . Four sets of eyes stared at me with the same gaze that left no doubt they were sisters . I could see various features of their parents in them-grey eyes here , light brown eyes there , angular faces , impatient movements . " Are you the new maid ? " the eldest asked . " We were told to watch out for you , " the bright redhead interrupted before I could reply . " Cornelia , go and get Tanneke , " the eldest said to her . " You go , Aleydis , " Cornelia in turn ordered the youngest , who gazed at me with wide grey eyes but did not move . " I 'll go . " The eldest must have decided my arrival was important after all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran ahead of her older sister , leaving me alone with the two quieter girls . I looked at the squirming baby in the girl 's lap . " Is that your brother or your sister ? " " Brother , " the girl replied in a soft voice like a feather pillow . " His name is Johannes . Never call him Jan . " She said the last words as if they were a familiar refrain . " I see . And your name ? " " Lisbeth . And this is Aleydis . " The youngest smiled at me . They were both dressed neatly in brown dresses with white aprons and caps . " And your older sister ? " " Maertge . Never call her Maria . Our grandmother 's name is Maria . Maria Thins . This is her house . " The baby began to whimper . Lisbeth joggled him up and down on her knee . I looked up at the house . It was certainly grander than ours , but not as grand as I had feared . It had two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one , with a tiny attic . It was an end house , with the Molenpoort running down one side , so that it was a little wider than the other houses in the street . It felt less pressed in than many of the houses in Delft , which were packed together in narrow rows of brick along the canals , their chimneys and stepped roofs reflected in the green canal water . The ground-floor windows of this house were very high , and on the first floor there were three windows set close together rather than the two of other houses along the street . From the front of the house the New Church tower was visible just across the canal . A strange view for a Catholic family , I thought . A church they will never even go inside . " So you 're the maid , are you ? " I heard behind me . The woman standing in the doorway had a broad face , pockmarked from an earlier illness . Her nose was bulbous and irregular , and her thick lips were pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light blue , as if she had caught the sky in them . She wore a grey-brown dress with a white chemise , a cap tied tight around her head , and an apron that was not as clean as mine . She stood blocking the doorway , so that Maertge and Cornelia had to push their way out round her , and looked at me with crossed arms as if waiting for a challenge . Already she feels threatened by me , I thought . She will bully me if I let her . " My name is Griet , " I said , gazing at her levelly . " I am the new maid . " The woman shifted from one hip to the other . " You 'd best come in , then , " she said after a moment . She moved back into the shadowy interior so that the doorway was clear . I stepped across the threshold . What I always remembered about being in the front hall for the first time were the paintings . I stopped inside the door , clutching my bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never so many in one room . I counted eleven . The largest painting was of two men , almost naked , wrestling each other . I did not recognize it as a story from the Bible , and wondered if it was a Catholic subject . Other paintings were of more familiar things-piles of fruit , landscapes , ships on the sea , portraits . They seemed to be by several painters . I wondered which of them were my new master 's . None was what I had expected of him . Later I discovered they were all by other painters-he rarely kept his own finished paintings in the house . He was an art dealer as well as an artist , and paintings hung in almost every room , even where I slept . There were more than fifty in all , though the number varied over time as he traded and sold them . " Come now , no need to idle and gape . " The woman hurried down a lengthy hallway , which ran along one side of the house all the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room on the left . On the wall directly opposite hung a painting that was larger than me . It was of Christ on the cross , surrounded by the Virgin Mary , Mary Magdalene , and St. John . I tried not to stare but I was amazed by its size and subject . " Catholics are not so different from us , " my father had said . But we did not have such pictures in our houses , or our churches , or anywhere . Now I would see this painting every day . I was always to think of that room as the Crucifixion room . I was never comfortable in it . The painting surprised me so much that I did not notice the woman in the corner until she spoke . " Well , girl , " she said , " that is something new for you to see . " She sat in a comfortable chair , smoking a pipe . Her teeth gripping the stem had gone brown , and her fingers were stained with ink . The rest of her was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though her lined face was stern her light brown eyes seemed amused . She was the kind of old woman who looked as if she would outlive everyone . She is Catharina 's mother , I thought suddenly . It was not just the color of her eyes and the wisp of grey curl that escaped her cap in the same way as her daughter 's . She had the manner of someone used to looking after those less able than she-of looking after Catharina . I understood now why I had been brought to her rather than her daughter . Though she seemed to look at me casually , her gaze was watchful . When she narrowed her eyes I realized she knew everything I was thinking . I turned my head so that my cap hid my face . Maria Thins puffed on her pipe and chuckled . " That 's right , girl . You keep your thoughts to yourself here . So , you 're to work for my daughter . She 's out now , at the shops . Tanneke here will show you round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , madam . " Tanneke , who had been standing at the old woman 's side , pushed past me . I followed , Maria Thins ' eyes branding my back . I heard her chuckling again . Tanneke took me first to the back of the house , where there were cooking and washing kitchens and two storage rooms . The washing kitchen led out to a tiny courtyard full of drying white laundry . " This needs ironing , for a start , " Tanneke said . I said nothing , though it looked as if the laundry had not yet been bleached properly by the midday sun . She led me back inside and pointed to a hole in the floor of one of the storage rooms , a ladder leading down into it . " You 're to sleep there , " she announced . " Drop your things there now and you can sort yourself out later . " I reluctantly let my bundle drop into the dim hole , thinking of the stones Agnes and Frans and I had thrown into the canal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt floor . I felt like an apple tree losing its fruit . I followed Tanneke back along the hallway , which all the rooms opened off-many more rooms than in our house . Next to the Crucifixion room where Maria Thins sat , towards the front of the house , was a smaller room with children 's beds , chamberpots , small chairs and a table , on it various earthenware , candlesticks , snuffers , and clothing , all in a jumble . " The girls sleep here , " Tanneke mumbled , perhaps embarrassed by the mess . She turned up the hallway again and opened a door into a large room , where light streamed in from the front windows and across the red and grey tiled floor . " The great hall , " she muttered . " Master and mistress sleep here . " Their bed was hung with green silk curtains . There was other furniture in the room-a large cupboard inlaid with ebony , a whitewood table pushed up to the windows with several Spanish leather chairs arranged around it . But again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this room than anywhere else . I counted to nineteen silently . Most were portraits-they appeared to be members of both families . There was also a painting of the Virgin Mary , and one of the three kings worshipping the Christ Child . I gazed at both uneasily . " Now , upstairs . " Tanneke went first up the steep stairs , then put a finger to her lips . I climbed as quietly as I could . At the top I looked around and saw the closed door . Behind it was a silence that I knew was him . I stood , my eyes fixed on the door , not daring to move in case it opened and he came out . Tanneke leaned towards me and whispered , " You 'll be cleaning in there , which the young mistress will explain to you later . And these rooms " - she pointed to the doors towards the back of the house- " are my mistress 's rooms . Only I go in there to clean . " We crept downstairs again . When we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're to take on the laundry for the house . " She pointed to a great mound of clothes-they had fallen far behind with their washing . I would struggle to catch up . " There 's a cistern in the cooking kitchen but you 'd best get your water for washing from the canal-it 's clean enough in this part of town . " " Tanneke , " I said in a low voice , " have you been doing all this yourself ? The cooking and cleaning and washing for the house ? " I had chosen the right words . " And some of the shopping . " Tanneke puffed up with pride at her own industry . " Young mistress does most of it , of course , but she goes off raw meat and fish when she 's carrying a child . And that 's often , " she added in a whisper . " You 're to go to the Meat Hall and the fish stalls too . That will be another of your duties . " With that she left me to the laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house , one a baby who would dirty more clothes than the rest . I would be laundering every day , my hands chapped and cracked from the soap and water , my face red from standing over the steam , my back aching from lifting wet cloth , my arms burned by the iron . But I was new and I was young-it was to be expected I would have the hardest tasks . The laundry needed to soak for a day before I could wash it . In the storage room that led down to the cellar I found two pewter waterpots and a copper kettle . I took the pots with me and walked up the long hallway to the front door . The girls were sitting on the bench . Now Lisbeth had the bubble blower while Maertge fed baby Johannes bread softened with milk . Cornelia and Aleydis were chasing bubbles . When I appeared they all stopped what they were doing and looked at me expectantly . " You 're the new maid , " the girl with the bright red hair declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pebble and threw it across the road into the canal . There were long scratches up and down her arm-she must have been bothering the house cat . " Where will you sleep ? " Maertge asked , wiping mushy fingers on her apron . " In the cellar . " " We like it down there , " Cornelia said . " Let 's go and play there now ! " She darted inside but did not go far . When no one followed her she came back out , her face cross . " Aleydis , " I said , extending my hand to the youngest girl , " will you show me where to get water from the canal ? " She took my hand and looked up at me . Her eyes were like two shiny grey coins . We crossed the street , Cornelia and Lisbeth following . Aleydis led me to stairs that descended to the water . As we peeked over I tightened my grip on her hand , as I had done years before with Frans and Agnes whenever we stood next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I ordered . Aleydis obediently took a step back . But Cornelia followed close behind me as I carried the pots down the steps . " Cornelia , are you going to help me carry the water ? If not , go back up to your sisters . " She looked at me , and then she did the worst thing . If she had sulked or shouted , I would know I had mastered her . Instead she laughed . I reached over and slapped her . Her face turned red , but she did not cry . She ran back up the steps . Aleydis and Lisbeth peered down at me solemnly . I had a feeling then . This is how it will be with her mother , I thought , except that I will not be able to slap her . I filled the pots and carried them to the top of the steps . Cornelia had disappeared . Maertge was still sitting with Johannes . I took one of the pots inside and back to the cooking kitchen , where I built up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to heat . When I came back Cornelia was outside again , her face still flushed . The girls were playing with tops on the grey and white tiles . None of them looked up at me . The pot I had left was missing . I looked into the canal and saw it floating , upside down , just out of reach of the stairs . " Yes , you will be a handful , " I murmured . I looked around for a stick to fish it out with but could find none . I filled the other pot again and carried it inside , turning my head so that the girls could not see my face . I set the pot next to the kettle on the fire . Then I went outside again , this time with a broom . Cornelia was throwing stones at the pot , probably hoping to sink it . " I 'll slap you again if you do n't stop . " " I 'll tell our mother . Maids do n't slap us . " Cornelia threw another stone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " A fearful look crossed Cornelia 's face . She dropped the stones she held . A boat was moving along the canal from the direction of the Town Hall . I recognized the man poling from earlier that day-he had delivered his load of bricks and the boat was riding much higher . He grinned when he saw me . I blushed . " Please , sir , " I began , " can you help me get that pot ? " " Oh , you 're looking at me now that you want something from me , are you ? There 's a change ! " Cornelia was watching me curiously . I swallowed . " I ca n't reach the pot from here . Perhaps you could- " The man leaned over , fished out the pot , dumped the water from it , and held it out to me . I ran down the steps and took it from him . " Thank you . I 'm most grateful . " He did not let go of the pot . " Is that all I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sleeve . I jerked my arm away and wrestled the pot from him . " Not this time , " I said as lightly as I could . I was never good at that sort of talk . He laughed . " I 'll be looking for pots every time I pass here now , wo n't I , young miss ? " He winked at Cornelia . " Pots and kisses . " He took up his pole and pushed off . As I climbed the steps back to the street I thought I saw a movement in the middle window on the first floor , the room where he was . I stared but could see nothing except the reflected sky .
