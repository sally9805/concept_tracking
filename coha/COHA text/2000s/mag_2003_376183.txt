Pakistan 's campaign to hunt down suspected Taliban and al-Qaeda guerrillas in the rugged territory bordering Afghanistan scored a major success last week with a raid by the Pakistani army in the country 's South Waziristan district . Eight suspected militants were killed and 18 were detained  --  all foreigners and " certainly terrorists , " said military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan . " As a matter of policy , Pakistan is determined to root out terrorism from its soil . " <P> But is it ? Skeptics note that Pakistan has a habit of announcing dramatic antiterrorism moves to coincide with high-level meetings with U.S. officials . At the time of the raid , President Pervez Musharraf had recently returned from U.N . headquarters in New York City , Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali was meeting with President Bush in Washington , and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage , who had earlier questioned whether Musharraf had the support of the entire Pakistani military , was preparing a trip to Islamabad . <P> Sultan insisted that the raid was " not at all to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , was it a response to last week 's release of a tape in which Osama bin Laden 's deputy , Ayman al-Zawahiri , called for the overthrow of Musharraf 's government . A Western diplomat in Islamabad also viewed the raid  --  which involved hundreds of Pakistani soldiers , two of whom were killed  --  as an indication that Pakistan is getting more serious in the fight against terrorism : " It was quite a bold move , because this is an area where the government has rarely operated . " Security analyst Talat Masood , a retired lieutenant general in the Pakistani army , said the raid may be evidence of a " renewed resolve " in Islamabad to fight it out in Pakistan 's tribal regions . If so , this will be welcome news to U.S. troops . Three days before the raid , an American soldier was killed just across the border in a skirmish with suspected Taliban guerrillas .  --  By Phil Zabriskie .
