First , you hear him tapping . He 's in his office , on his farm on the southern border of Michigan , making art . He 's such a big man  --  solid as a brick wall and well over 6 ft.  --  that he nearly dwarfs the conference table where he 's seated . Before him is a large piece of paper and several black markers . In the center of the paper he 's drawn a tiny boxing ring with two tiny stick figures . The larger one is labeled MUHAMMAD ALI , and it 's delivering a solid punch to the much smaller one , labeled JOE FRAZIER . <P> All around the boxing ring , all the way out to the edges of the paper , the 59-year-old artist formerly known as Cassius Clay taps away with his black marker , making hundreds of dots , each representing one spectator . " Thrilla in Manila , " he says , struggling to speak , in a low , gravelly whisper . " These are the people . " He often draws these pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him busy for hours and helps maintain his motor skills , which have been diminished by the Parkinson 's he has suffered from for two decades . But his mind and sense of humor remain sharp . While tap-tap-tapping away with his black marker , he talks about Ali , the movie about his life opening Dec. 25 , with Will Smith in the title role . <P> " He did a good job , " says Muhammad Ali , who played himself in the awful 1977 biopic The Greatest . For this new movie , under the tutelage of director Michael Mann ( The Insider ) , Smith prepared by studying Ali 's Islamic faith and learning to box , training for nearly a year . The 33-year-old star added 30 lbs . of muscle to his lanky physique and transformed his body into a nearly perfect replica of the champ 's when he was in fighting form . When this observation is shared with Ali , he pauses , then looks up from his drawing and , his eyes twinkling a bit , says with a small smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali often says things like this to shock strangers . The truth is , no one looks like Ali . Smith is arguably the most likable movie star on the planet , but not even he possesses Ali 's singular DNA pattern of beauty , grace and bravado . To make a movie about Ali  --  perhaps the most idolized , vilified and complex public figure of the 20th century  --  has been a high-wire act of both hubris and dedication . " For an African American , Muhammad Ali is the biggest role you could have . Malcolm X , Muhammad Ali and Nelson Mandela  --  with any of those roles comes a responsibility , " says Smith . " The level of dedication to this role is unparalleled to anything I 've done so far other than having a family . " <P> Ali 's journey to the screen began a decade ago , when Oliver Stone met with the champ about making a movie of his life . They remained friendly , but the professional collaboration ended when the director refused to share creative control of the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and photographer , and Lonnie Ali , his fourth wife and business partner , hooked up with producer Paul Ardaji . A friend and former advertising executive , Ardaji optioned the rights to the fighter 's life , and the project eventually landed at Sony . The Alis maintained contractual control over the movie 's basic story and met with all five writers ( including Mann ) who would work on the screenplay.
