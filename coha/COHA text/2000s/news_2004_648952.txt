<p> The Summer Olympics opened formally here Friday with a spectacle drawing heavily on the pure forms of ancient Greek mythology and the voluminous security precautions for the modern age of terrorism . <p> The Greek hosts of the Games mobilized their own fighter jets , a network of spy cameras , Awacs surveillance planes from NATO , a 100,000-strong security force and a small armada of patrol boats and warships . <p> The extraordinary measures were added to Athens 's plans after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the United States . While the Greeks did not resist and have spent more than $1.2 billion on security , the plans especially reflect the United States government 's concerns that the Americans may be at risk at such a high-profile and prolonged event . The Games run through Aug. 29 . <p> As the Olympics officially got under way , however , Western intelligence officials said they had no evidence of a specific terrorist threat . None of the recent arrests in Pakistan , for example , including those that resulted in the terrorist alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Qaeda was planning attacks on the Olympics , the intelligence officials said . <p> The first test of the security shield came as more than 70,000 people attended the parade of athletes in the main Olympic stadium , passing first through a bank of metal detectors before watching a dramatic re-enactment of the birth of the Games 2,780 years ago in Olympia . The first modern Games were here in 1896 . <p> Some 100 heads of state and other dignitaries were in Athens for the customary extravaganza that opens the Olympics , including former President George Bush and the twin daughters of the current president . <p> Security concerns did not diminish the high-spirited traditional parade of athletes , who marched in a mix of outfits like the white suits and red shirts of the Latvians and the leopard-skin loincloths of the Burundian contingent . <p> Above the brightly lighted stadium , at least six helicopters hovered with blinking lights , and a 200-foot blimp , crammed with surveillance cameras and microphones , floated like a gentle whale . <p> While security was tight at the entrances and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on guard kept a discreet profile . spectators trying to leave were penned in behind a locked fence at the end of the fireworks display . <p> Over the past three years , Greece has sent thousands of police officers for intensive training , and the government has sought to reassure other countries that no security request has been ignored . <p> Greek security forces have prepared for some 200 possible situations , " from the simplest incident to World War III , " said Col. Eleftherios Ikonomou , a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Order , which controls the national police and coast guard . <p> " This is an unprecedented task , and an unprecedented network has been put into place , " he said . <p> The Olympics present particular security challenges , experts said . The Games take place over 17 days at more than 100 sites and in 5 cities . Some 20,000 athletes from 202 countries are expected to participate and must move frequently and perform in public . <p> In addition to mobilizing personnel , Greece bought a $325 million security package from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a major provider of security systems for the American military . <p> The Greek system , a newer version of the security grid used at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , was meant to manage data from hundreds of surveillance cameras , underwater sensors at ports , vehicle-tracking devices , motion detectors fastened to fences around the event sites , and images captured by the blimp . <p> But the computer system that is the backbone of the security setup became operational only at midnight Tuesday , more than two months behind schedule . <p> Software engineers are working out the bugs , said a Western security analyst who works for one of the companies that has supplied software for the system . Most of the components are working , like the motion detectors , the analyst said , but they have not been linked to feed data to the main command post as originally envisioned . <p> The analyst and Greek officials said the absence of the link should not jeopardize security . " It does n't raise issues in operational planning , " Ikonomou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working . " <p> Over the past two weeks , as it became clear that the final computer link would not be ready , the Greeks said that they would deploy more police officers and soldiers to bolster the security system . Greek officials said this week that they would deploy 60,000 police officers , firefighters , coast guard officers and volunteers as part of the security network . An additional 40,000 soldiers were called in to help guard the event sites , state communications and utility facilities , railroad depots and border crossings . <p> When Greece won the right to be host to the Olympics in 1997 , its entire estimated budget was $1.6 billion . Recent projections put the costs at more than $7 billion , including infrastructure improvements , security equipment , bonuses for civil servants and contract overruns . <p> Despite fears that anti-American jeers might greet the United States ' athletes , the team was greeted with the same polite chorus of cheers that welcomed other national teams . The American athletes skipped any strutting and prancing , opting instead for a subdued march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few small American flags . <p> Some American Olympic veterans , including the tennis champion Venus Williams and the swimmer Michael Phelps , did not participate in the procession . Phelps is scheduled to compete  --  and is expected to win his first gold medal  --  on Saturday . <p> Dawn Staley , the three-time Olympian and the point guard on the women 's basketball team , carried the American flag . The men 's basketball players brought up the rear of the delegation , filming the moment with video cameras . <p> For the diver Caesar Garcia , the best moment was when the team emerged from a tunnel leading into the stadium and heard cheering . <p> " It was phenomenal , " he said . " The only ones I heard who got a bigger introduction were the Greeks , which is to be expected . " <p> The opening ceremony has become a ritual of the televised , branded and marketed Olympic Games . The 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles , probably the first Olympics opened with the pizazz of a Las Vegas show , featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recent years , the opening spectacles have favored the natural elements of wind , water and fire combined with tightly choreographed dancing and themed pyrotechnics . <p> The earliest Greek games struck a different note , opening with the athletes filing in solemn procession before a 43-foot gold and ivory statue of Zeus . So did the judges , swearing to carry out their duties honestly . <p> The ceremony Friday also provided some politically poignant moments . North Korean and South Korean athletes marched together . Afghanistan 's two female Olympians , the first in its history , paraded proudly behind their flag . The women  --  Robina Muqimyar , a track sprinter , and Friba Razayee , a judo competitor  --  trained in Greece the past two months . <p> But for many Greeks , the flash and fire of the opening ceremony were dimmed by the meltdown of their Olympic hopes over the past week . <p> Most painful was the uncertain future of their two star track athletes , the sprinters Konstantinos Kenteris and Katerina Thanou , whose failure to appear for a drug test was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hospital , being treated for minor injuries from a motorcycle accident on Thursday night . <p> Last week , the Greek Olympic baseball team lost two players to doping charges , and a Greek judo champion who was to compete in the Games was critically injured in a fall from a fourth-floor balcony under mysterious circumstances . <p> " We waited 108 years to enjoy these magical moments , and now for all Greeks , this event has become shrouded by doubt and questions , " the Greek newspaper Ethnos said on Friday . " Now all we can hope for is a miracle .
