Satisfied Customer Editorial reply : # Tall Dark and Furry <p> I FIND IT QUITE AWKWARD , all this silly writing about myself , but here goes . <p> I am a reasonably attractive mixed breed Setter and Blonde Lab ( on my mother 's side ) seeking a companionable mate in the vicinity of Regent 's Park , where my master takes me most afternoons between four and five thirty . I am three years old and , while still a virgin , my genitalia remain fully intact , which has led to some rather embarrassing confrontations with my master 's guests recently . Especially if they 've been in contact with a female dog in the last , say , seven or eight hours . <p> I ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I enjoy grooming ( myself and others ) , television ( with the sound off ) , and most of Hayden 's late wind concertos , even though they are normally dismissed by the world 's dull-as-dishwater Mozart enthusiasts . I 'm not dissing Mozart , understand . I just think there were a lot of equally talented eighteenth-century composers running around Europe , even if their lives were n't melodramatic enough to inspire an Oscar-winning film by Milos Forman . <p> My ideal partner would be a mixed breed like myself , since I do n't want to get into a lot of weird social games about who pisses where . She should be attractive , with a nice rump , and enjoy the same things I do , such as catching flies , and illegally bathing in the duck pond . Also , it would help if her master got along with my master , kind of like in A Hundred and One Dalmatians . My master , incidentally , is a very kind ( and totally unattractive ) human male who does n't like living alone any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flogging surplus capital in the City , he lies around the house masturbating and watching Nazi documentaries on the History Channel . <p> No time wasters , please . Photo available on request . <p> This Lady 's Not for Stroking Dear TDF , <p> I joined this service as a trial member a few nights back when I came across your profile . You sound really nice and yes , I , too , live within the immediate vicinity of Regent 's Park . <p> It feels sad joining a computer-dating service , but I 'm a middle-aged bitch who has never been on a proper date in her entire life , so I 've got to start somewhere . <p> I should mention right off that I 'm not a virgin . This is due to an unfortunate week spent in the so-called " animal-friendly " Doggy-Do Kennels in West 14 when my mistress went to Barbados . It 's an experience I 'd just as soon not talk about right now . <p> I hate trying to describe myself , so I 've attached a recent e-photo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into all my photos . And yes , I realize she is pretty unattractive , even for a human female . But she has a good heart and walks me twice a day . So I guess I probably love her . <p> I should also mention that she is American , which means brashness is part of my nature . I know it gets up British noses , but it 's the way I am . So get used to it . <p> As for my likes and dislikes , here goes . <p> I like long runs at the beach ; raw meat ( though I can get along fine on cereal ) ; and lazy days lying at home on a shag carpet with a good video . I guess it 's hard to describe . my ideal mate since it boils down to a matter of chemistry , but I value honesty and a good sense of humor above all else . And well , okay . A great-looking rump does n't hurt . <p> On the other hand , I hate phoniness and cynicism and needless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , Denise Russian Princess Seeks American Prince Zdrastvuyte from Mother Russia , where lonely Slavic princess find herself living with great-nippled Mamma and six beautiful lesbian sisters . I am being much fond of America and its people all the time , where I would like to visit shortly , preferring it be in company of tall handsome butch American so and so .

And prepare yourself for hot humpy loving all night long ! <p> Lovely Dear Denise , <p> Thank you so much for your lovely photo . I had my doubts before , but perhaps this internet dating service has its merits . <p> Time will tell , perhaps . <p> Please find attached a recent photo of myself on holiday last spring in the Lake District , a gorgeous country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I know I 'm no Rin Tin Tin in the looks department , but that has never left me wanting for female admirers , since l possess many compelling natural odors which are not convertible into Rich Text Format . <p> Of course , this innate attraction to the opposite sex has never paid off in what might be called carnal dividends . Sure , I 'm allowed to race and frolic with the ladies of Regent 's Park , but once the action gets serious ? My master hits me on the nose with a rolled up copy of Private Eye . <p> I loathe Private Eye . I do n't know about you , but I genuinely loathe it . <p> Maybe we could meet sometime soon . My master and I usually arrive at Marylebone Green around four or four thirty . <p> Is your mistress persuadable ? <p> Your New Friend , Randall Do You Yahoo ?

You 're definitely a lot better looking than you seem to realize . ( Not that looks matter to me in the long run . ) <p> Actually , I still have my doubts about this dating service . With the obvious exception of yourself , the only people who ever write me seem like total creeps and weirdos . Russian pornographers , cosmetic surgeons , international loan brokers , and e-perverts of every species and description . It makes you wonder about the genetic imperative , does n't it ? Reproduce or die . Is that what it 's all about ? <p> Being a single female in the big city has made me a little cynical , I guess . <p> As far as an assignation , I 'll see what I can do . There are two ends to every leash , as my old Mom use to say . <p> Love , Denise Doggy doggy doggy doggy Doggy doggy doggy me love doggy doggy are me favorite me like big doggy me like strong mean doggy doggy get mad and bite me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard me like big strong doggy bite me hard miaow sorry for that miaow sorry for that me a big doggy me a strong doggy and want lots of doggy love want lots of mean doggy love miaow sorry sorry big mean doggy paws are too big for master keyboard miaow love the big doggy love the big doggy doggy love me ? <p> Please write back please send photo of big mean doggy growling hot angry all night long photo please jpg format please big doggy so hot and angry me want you so bad me very big doggy me very strong doggy please love me please . <p> Your obedient doggy need discipline now , Rosco the Very Big Doggy Definitely Not a Cat miaow <p> A Perfect Day Dear Denise , <p> What a lovely day in the park .

I ca n't help myself . <p> I just start barking like crazy . <p> Will write more soon , Randall Counter-Conditioning Dearest Randall , <p> What can I say ? I detected a pretty convincing whiff from our correspondence but as soon as I smelled you coming across the children 's playground I knew you in my bones , Randall . You make me feel like radar . <p> It was so perfect . The bits of Sun shining through and the green grass and the dusty pollen everywhere . Racing and snapping at each other and then you caught me ( just at the moment I let you ) and please , do n't blame your master for getting strict with that rolled up rag . We both kind of deserved it . <p> That weird orange cat freaked me out , though . Slithering through the nasturtiums and peering and hissing and licking himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective masters hit it off ? They hardly looked each other in the eye which , considering their appalling features , is pretty understandable . And the smell ! <p> Can anybody figure how these creatures make love face to face ? <p> Love , Denise Brainy Hunk Seeks Same or Better As you can see from the attached photo , I m a great-looking , well-exercised , full-blooded German Shepard who believes in maintaining himself both in body and mind . As such , I spend large parts of the day contemplating life s impenetrable mysteries , such as the meaning of existence , or the corporate destruction of animal life . Not to mention I once caught thirty-seven Frisbees in a row at the beach . <p> Do you ever wonder what s really going on inside the heads of our bizarre and often useless masters ? Do you ever wonder how healthy , intelligent dogs such as ourselves kept in touch before this marvelous invention called the Internet ? Do you feel it s time for a revolutionary change in the cause of animal rights and I m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopped up for sandwiches . I m talking about us dogs who have been unfairly restricted from attending our nation s churches , schools , and government buildings for centuries . <p> When was the last time you saw a dog run for Congress or Parliament ? And considering the woeful state of our Western democracies , who could it hurt ? <p> If you ever stay awake nights worrying about these and other questions , please drop me a line . And don t forget to attach a photo of your hairy posterior , just so I know our chemistry is clicking . <p> Love , Rex So Long You 've Been Gone Denise ? Honey ? <p> Every day we go to the park and you 're not there . I know it 's hopeless in terms of a long-term relationship . I know our masters are too hideous to develop an attachment to one another . But I can only think about tomorrow , Denise . And I need to see you . <p> Even if it 's for only an hour or a minute . <p> Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Share the Magic Dear Randall , <p> Ca n't talk now . I 've been doing a little research and you wo n't believe what I discovered . <p> I feel so ashamed for all those silly , cynical things I said about Internet dating services ! <p> Hold on , baby . We 're almost home . <p> Love , Denise Oriental Beauty Seeks American Male for Much Loving Do you often wish for lovely Oriental bitch with much loving for to give ?

" What a fortuitous circumstance of formidable complexity ! <p> Perhaps you will not recall an incident of such inherent triviality , but we actually encountered one another in Regent 's Park last week , or more accurately , our canine associates encountered one another in what might have developed into an unwholesome public display had you not intervened with your handy ( and quite absorbing ) magazine , of which I am likewise fond on many occasions . <p> I have considered your scent often in the many weeks since our encounter and can not get your attractive buttocks out of my mind , but then you will have to pardon my American bravado and vocabulary . I believe you refer to it as your " bum , " and might consider it gauche for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in free correspondence . <p> Please excuse my American candor , however , and perhaps my resultant awkwardness in formal composition regarding these matters . But I felt I must write you since it has caused me much joy to contemplate our reencounter in a park-like setting of our mutual convenience . <p> Perhaps I might put this more bluntly . Could we perhaps meet sometime soon ? Since you are the male aggressor in such matters , I will leave the time and place to your decision utterly . <p> Might it not be pleasing to our canine associates to come along for the encounter ? I am sure they have learned their lesson , and will not grow excessively amorous in any way disturbing to public decency , especially that of the English . <p> In case you are lachrymose in recalling my attractivity , I have enclosed an e-photo of my most compelling feature . Please use as you see fit , say as a screen-saver on your computer , which would remind you of my charms periodically and well-arouse your semen-delivery mechanisms . <p> Being a female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this open display of honesty , and ask that you kindly not remind me of such displays in future , as they might scare me away , or make me less receptive to the types of licking and sniffing I enjoy upon first greeting in an amorous style of behavior . <p> Please understand that I am not a " loose woman " whatsoever , but have spent my entire life saving my passions for someone who smells just like you . <p> Anticipating Your Reply , Candy Ready for the Adventure ? Dear Denise , <p> What a brilliant bitch . I ca n't tell you how proud I am . <p> Bonehead has been running around all day with his head in the clouds . He ca n't sit still for a minute . He even bought me a new collar with these green gem-like studs . They 're just colored glass , but I ca n't wait for you to see me in it . <p> My master has done himself one better . He 's had a haircut , a facial , a manicure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly as sin , and smells as bad as Lysol air freshener , but he has a good heart and I hope your mistress appreciates that sufficiently . ( Not that she 's any gift to nature herself , if you ask my opinion . ) <p> I 'm so excited I could piss all over the crummy linoleum . But I 'm saving all I have for you ! <p> See you in the park , muchacha ! <p> Love , Randall Satisfied Customer Dear Doggylove.com , <p> My name is name withheld and I 'm writing to thank you so much for your lovely dating service . <p> I guess I 've always been cynical about these dealybops in the past , but that was before I met name withheld and found out how wonderful true love can be . <p> It seems like only weeks ago we were living in our separate domiciles , chewing our crunchy biscuits and moping , with nothing more exciting to look forward to than a scratch behind the ear from one of our sad , homely masters . Then we joined doggylove.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance . <p> Even our masters got in on the act , mated , engendered an offspring , and bought a house in the country , to which we will be transporting our doggy beds in just a few days . We ca n't wait to get there and piss on all the trees ! <p> Not to mention have a litter of our own and raise them in open harmony with nature , much like in the concluding scenes of our favorite movie , One Hundred and One Dalmatians . <p> Sometimes I turn to name withheld in the night and say to him , " Honey , bite me on the rump . I must be dreaming ! " <p> And name withheld always does exactly what I ask . Because , of course , he truly cares . <p> Oh , there 's the occasional gray cloud . For example , my mistress just bought my master a lifetime subscription to Private Eye for his birthday . ( It 's a long story . ) But we take the good with the bad , I guess . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yours sincerely , Lost in Heaven Editorial reply : Dear Lost in Heaven , <p> Thanks so much for sharing your positive , life-affirming experiences with the rapidly expanding membership of doggylove.com , which has recently opened branches in Germany , the Netherlands , Saudi Arabia , and the Philippines .
