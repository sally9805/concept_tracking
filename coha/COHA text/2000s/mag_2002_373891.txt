Each candidate has raised more than $1 million , appealed to voters through TV ads and benefited from campaigns by outside interest groups . Sound like your average congressional race ? Maybe , but this one is actually the contest between two judges running for a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court . <P> While the attention of most voters is focused on the key races for the Senate and the House , campaigning for state and local judgeships has increasingly become part of the modern , big-money political world . Spending on Supreme Court campaigns in the 38 states where such judges are elected jumped 61% between 1998 and 2000 , according to the nonprofit group Justice at Stake , and is on track for another big increase this year . Outside interests such as the Chamber of Commerce , pushing a nationwide campaign to cap jury awards , as well as trial lawyers and labor unions , are pouring money in . <P> One of the nastiest free-for-alls is in Ohio , where Republican Justice Evelyn Lundberg Stratton and Democratic Cuyahoga County judge Janet Burnside are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Stratton 's side are doctors who feel she is more likely to keep malpractice awards low . The physicians have been passing out mock " prescription pads " in their offices advising patients to vote for her . On the other side , Citizens for an Independent Court , a union-and lawyer-backed political action committee , has attacked Stratton with an ad that contrasts men laughing in a limousine  --  depicted as " their side "  --  with a family at a picnic table and a welder at work  --  described as " our side . " The most brazen of the ads , run by a group calling itself Competition Ohio but bankrolled by AT &T,; accuses local phone provider SBC Ameritech of doubling rates and taking away consumer choice and suggests that a Stratton victory would mean lower phone bills . <P> Both candidates have disavowed the ads . But the influx of money to judicial campaigns helps create an impression that justice can be bought . In two national polls over the past year , 76% of voters said they believe that judges ' impartiality is affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . North Carolina did something about it : a law providing public financing for judicial elections was signed this fall . But in other states , judges will have to keep spending .  --  By Viveca Novak
