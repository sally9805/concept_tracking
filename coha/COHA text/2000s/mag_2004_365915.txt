It 's a beautiful day in New York City , and Gary Sinise and Melina Kanakaredes are spending it on a garbage barge docked on the East River . They 're shooting on location for CSI : New York , and the pair has found a lovely corpse in fishnet stockings among the trash . Fortunately for them , it 's " clean " trash  --  Pampers boxes , garbage bags filled with paper wads . When the crew used a barge filled with real garbage on CSI : Miami , it found a bloated dead rat that  --  waste not , want not  --  it used in the scene . <P> Executive producer Anthony Zuiker gleefully surveys the set , complete with a Coast Guard helicopter thundering overhead and Coast Guard and N.Y.P.D. boats offshore . " They gave us a chopper and two cutters  --  no charge ! " he says . " How cool is that ? " <P> Way cool , if you get past the nagging worry that in a city at terrorism-alert orange , the hardware might be better used for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved CSI 's level of success , everyone wants to give you a 21-gun salute . Your viewers do ; they made CSI the most popular drama on TV and its two sequels , Miami and New York , instant Top 10 hits . Your network does ; chairman Leslie Moonves of CBS approved the New York spin-off in a meeting that essentially consisted of his asking Zuiker to pick a city . " You ca n't overestimate how important the CSI franchise is to us , " says Moonves . " It is the linchpin of the resurrection of this network . " Your peers do ; at this year 's Emmys , the original CSI was nominated for Best Drama for the third year in a row . And if imitation is TV 's highest compliment , you need only read the listings to see the crime spree the networks are on . <P> And why not ? CSI and its cohort have taught TV new visual tricks , raised its production standards and perhaps shown the dinosaur networks a way to survive the swarm of nimble cable competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they have also  --  cop show after doctor-cop show after military-cop show  --  made it more homogeneous . They have taught TV to tell entertaining , simple stories without dumbing them down  --  and left the networks uninterested in much besides simple stories . The CSI effect has produced TV that looks 21st century but is as conventional as a rerun of Mannix . In some ways CSI is among the best that network drama has to offer , and it is evidence of how limited the networks ' idea of " best " has become . <P> Within a few months in the year 2000 , CBS debuted two series that not only turned around a limping network but also reshaped network TV . The effect of the first  --  Survivor  --  and of the dozens of reality shows that followed it was quick and obvious . But the second  --  CSI : Crime Scene Investigation  --  got little initial attention , even from CBS . CSI proved a dream marriage of the edgy and the safe : an old-fashioned whodunit , set in sexy Las Vegas , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but geeky enough  --  scientists wielding swabs , not guns  --  to attract the passionate audience of a cult show .
