Chapter One Pulling out a section from HIDDEN EMPIRE is like taking a grain of sand from a beach . With all the storylines , alien races , and colorful planets , it 's difficult to pin down one piece that is representative . This chapter features a group of human " space gypsies " who call themselves Roamers . They are fiercely independent and not particularly well liked by the rest of " civilized " humanity , but they have found a very lucrative niche for themselves by taking over the dirty industry of skymining - or extracting hydrogen from the clouds of gas giant planets and converting it into stardrive fuel . Ross Tamblyn is the oldest brother in his clan , and he has broken from the family water business in order to finance and run a giant cloud-harvesting facility . Everything is at stake for him in this risky venture , and he needs to prove himself to his father ( who has disowned him ) and his fiancee , the beautiful Cesca Peroni . Skimming the night-side clouds of the gas giant Golgen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sleep . He paced the decks , eyes open , keeping a paternal watch on all systems . His life was invested here , his reputation and the inheritance he 'd scraped together before his father had disowned him . Before going out into the biting open wind , Ross dressed in warm garments , wrapping a clan scarf around his neck , shrugging a many-pocketed jacket over his shoulders . He pulled the hood over his ragged-cut dark hair , adjusted the insulated gloves , and stepped out for a breath of fresh air a thousand miles above the unseen surface of the gas giant . Ross cycled through the wind door onto his private observation deck . He loved to steal time to stare out at the milky ocean of thunderheads and cirrus veils , feeling the raw wind on his face . Most of the white doves had settled into their roosts for the night . They cooed , sounding like bubbles under water . A few of the pet birds spread their wings and flew out in long gentle courses , riding the high breezes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterile Golgen the doves would find no food other than what Ross Tamblyn put out for them . The chill night bore a taint of sulfurous fumes , rising chemicals and gases belched from internal weather patterns . Ross gripped the railing with his gloves , felt the breeze stir his hair and flap his hood . The atmosphere yawned beneath him through uncharted cloud layers . With increasing depth , the air grew thicker and hotter until it terminated at the planet 's super-high-density metallic core , where nothing could survive . As he peered into the silvery cloud deck , Ross noticed deep lightning storms that hid under layers of multicolored mist . The disturbance was far beneath the tentacle-strung weather probes that dangled from the skymine 's belly . He could hear no thunder in the vastness of Golgen 's sky , only a gentle cooing of doves . As he watched , though , the lightning storms appeared to climb higher , a turbulence approaching the habitable atmospheric levels . The white birds stirred in their roosts , as if they could sense something ominous. ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen to be anywhere else . The Blue Sky Mine was his home and his dream . At the age of twenty-seven , shortly after he 'd invested in this wild venture , Ross had been brash and bold - and why not , since he was already attempting to do an impossible thing ? ? With a smile , he recalled the day he had approached Cesca Peroni , a woman he 'd long admired but did not know very well . He met her in an empty tunnel in the clustered asteroids of Rendezvous . Willing to take a gamble and ready to accept failure , Ross had walked right up to her and asked her to marry him . Cesca had raised her eyebrows and assessed the broad-shouldered young man , the outcast son of a powerful clan determined to make his own success . When she 'd smiled at Ross , his heart had melted and he knew he 'd made the correct choice . Cesca was taken with him , though hesitant . After being trained by Speaker Jhy Okiah , the young woman was politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She had touched a fingertip to her full lower lip . " I admit your Blue Sky Mine is a viable commercial opportunity . But if you do n't succeed and I 'm already betrothed to you , then I 'll have thrown away my chance to make a good marriage alliance . " He could n't tell if she was teasing him . " I realize you might be wary of me , Cesca , " he had said . " I 've already been ostracized by my father , but I swear I 'll make my own way. ? I know I can pay off the Golgen facility . My dream is to become independent and strong , and I know exactly how to accomplish it . " She shrugged . " And what would my family say ? The Peronis are a powerful clan in their own right. ? Since I 'm his only daughter , my father expects great things from me . " Ross had clasped his hands in front of him . " And well he should . But you are clearly being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for even his pride ? " He was glad they had a chance to talk frankly , but he could n't decide if she was playing with him , or genuinely considering her options . Though the two felt warm toward each other , their decision would be based on a reasonable analysis of consequences , rather than frivolous romantic giddiness . A true Roamer match . " I can offer you this , Ross Tamblyn , " Cesca finally said , crossing her slender arms over her chest and trying to hold a cool mask over what seemed to be an amused smile . " I will agree to wed you if you 're able to pay off the Blue Sky Mine and make a profit . " He had laughed. ? " Easily done ... though it might take a few years . Are you willing to wait ? Give me four years . " " I 'm in no hurry. ? Four years , then . I think I can manage to remain unmarried in the meantime . " And so , for the past three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving , never giving up hope , never interested in reconciling with his old father . He had worked diligently in the Golgen clouds , where the harvesting grounds were a particularly rich source of stardrive fuel . Now , at the age of thirty , he was clearly on the road to paying off the enormous industrial structure. ? It was a matter of pride for him , and it would prove himself in front of his father . This year , he would finally meet his goal ; their marriage date had already been set .... Now , with a gust of cool wind , the huge skymine shuddered in the air . The white doves fluttered from their roosts , and four more took wing. ? Ross looked over the deck rail and watched the angry knot of flashing fireballs , deep lightning storms like a boiling electrical sea . Coming closer . The intercom startled Ross as the captain on watch located him . " Big disturbance below , Chief . Something large , unlike anything we 've seen before . " The watch captain had spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had seen every possible atmospheric phenomenon by now . He raised his voice as the biting wind grew louder , whistling around his hood . " Do you think we should move the skymine ? " The captain responded immediately . " The disturbance is moving too fast , Ross . We could n't maneuver around it , even if we tried . " Then the thick cloud decks split open like a blister , and Ross strained his eyes to see , to believe. ? An awesome crystal shape emerged from the silent depths , a shimmering diamond globe that rose higher ... growing larger . " Shizz ! Do you see - " The speaker crackled with static , as if the local intercom transmission had been disrupted . Ross stared and finally , with even greater amazement , realized what he was seeing . A ship . The alien vessel was a huge sphere studded with triangular protrusions , like intersecting pyramids half-caught within a glass bubble . Blue lightning crackled from the points of the pyramids , connecting them with an electrical spiderweb , arcs jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bizarre structure from the deepest strata of the gas world . He could n't imagine what sort of mind might have built it - or what it wanted . Ross staggered backward , releasing his hold on the support rail . " Take us up ! " he shouted , but he did n't know if the watch captain could hear him . " Give me another kilometer of altitude - hell , make it ten ! " Still the alien ship kept coming , silent and ominous . By comparison , the skymine looked like a gnat in the air . Ross had a sudden vision of a sea monster on old Earth rising to devour a sailing ship . His mind could n't even grasp the curvature of the diamond hull that reflected the clawlike lightning . " By the Guiding Star ! " He had heard old Roamer tales about mysterious sightings on gas planets , a crazy survivor of the long-ago disaster on Daym - but no one had ever dreamed that such deep-core dwellers might actually exist . All the doves scattered now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself into the open air , growing larger and larger . " What are you ? What do you want ? " His words could never be picked up through the storm and wind , nor would they be comprehended by whatever might exist within that strange vessel . He shouted as loud as he could , " We mean you no harm ! " As the enormous construction loomed over the skymine , it sent low-frequency pulses through the air , like basso words in a voice that might have been spoken by a whale in the depths of an Earth ocean . The vibrations blasted Ross , pounding his skin and making his skull shudder . The watch captain had already sounded alarms throughout the facility , rousing all the workers from their sleep shifts . But the skymine had no weapons , no defenses . The serpentine energy bolts reached a brilliant intensity , sparking from point to point on the sharp protrusions , then leaped outward . Ross shouted , covering his eyes . Electrical lances tore open the skymine complex , slicing apart the ekti reactors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nozzles . Another explosion shook the decks . The Blue Sky Mine lurched , tilted ... then began to plummet . Exposed on the deck , Ross could barely hang on . The white doves , shrieking , flew farther away into the sky , though with the skymine gone , they would never find another place to land . The doves would fly without food or rest until they died from sheer exhaustion . A second blast from the spike-studded alien globe split the Blue Sky Mine down its structural spine. ? The components broke apart , and flaming wreckage tumbled like meteors into the bottomless sky . Ross could hear the screams of his crew . He felt his heart ready to explode with helplessness . He could not even answer the words the exotic alien had spoken. ? The lurch of another explosion hurled him from the observation platform out into the open air with the rest of the debris . High above , the destructive alien ship observed what it had done and sent no further words of condemnation . Ross plummeted , arms outstretched , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the complete ruin of everything he valued ... before the thickening clouds swallowed him up . He still had more than a thousand miles to fall . ( Continues ... )
