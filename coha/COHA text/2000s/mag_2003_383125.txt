A stellar riddle turns up at the Milky Way 's core <p> For nearly a decade , Andrea M. Ghez has tracked the motion of stars at the Milky Way 's core . The great speed with which these centrally located stars whirl around provides the best evidence to date for the existence of an extremely dense and massive object  --  a supermassive black hole  --  right in the bull's-eye of the galaxy . Like most astronomers , Ghez , who is based at the University of California , Los Angeles , had assumed these closely orbiting stars were relatively old and lightweight . <p> Last summer , she had her first inkling that something was wrong with this picture . In June , the prime month for viewing the galactic center with the Keck Telescope 's ultra-sharp optics on Hawaii 's Manna Kea , her team took the highest-quality spectrum ever of any of these close-in stars . So puzzling were the results that the young astronomer passed up an opportunity last July to share the new data at a research conference . By August , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubbed S0-2 confirmed that it and the other stars circling near the galaxy 's core are unusually young and massive  --  some 15 to 20 times as heavy as the sun . One of the stars lies as close to the galactic center as twice Pluto 's distance from the sun . <p> Such stars have no business being anywhere near that close to the galactic center . Massive stars are short-lived . They burn their nuclear fuel so fast that they can last no more than 10 million years , Ghez and her colleagues note in the April 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters . <p> " These are stars ... that are short-lived , in astronomical terms , in a region that 's incredibly inhospitable to star formation , " notes Ghez . " In fact , given our current understanding of how stars form and the properties of the galactic center , it 's not allowed to happen . " <p> Under ordinary conditions , no star could be born so close to a supermassive black hole . Stars arise from the gravitational collapse of cold clouds of mostly hydrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diameter of 30 light-years and a low density . The tidal forces exerted by the supermassive black hole  --  the differences in the gravitational tug the black hole exerts on the different parts of such a cloud  --  would be so enormous that it would rip the cloud to shreds long before stars could emerge . <p> On the other hand , models in which massive stars are born at a safe distance from a black hole  --  about 100 light-years  --  and then migrate toward its galaxy 's core have their own problems . Since massive stars last only a few million years , they should die out long before they complete the journey inward . <p> Making sense of the massive stars near the Milky Way 's core " is a real challenge , " says Reinhard Genzel of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching , Germany . Genzel has tracked the motion of stars orbiting the galactic center since the late 1980s . Theorists , he notes , first began to worry a decade ago , when researchers found massive stars about a light-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apparently massive stars at one-hundredth that distance from the core 's black hole , theorists are faced with a much tougher puzzle . <p> SUPERDENSE GAS CLOUDS There 's an outside chance that stars might form in the immediate vicinity of a supermassive black hole , but the birthing process would be unlike any other known in the galaxy , says Mark Morris of UCLA . For example , if a gas cloud can compress to a million times the usual star-forming density , it should withstand the black hole 's tidal forces and remain intact long enough to make stars . <p> If such a process actually unfolded at the Milky Way 's center , however , the gas density would have to have been dramatically larger 5 million to 7 million years spilling its stars into orbits around the black hole . ago , when the stars were forming , than it is today . <p> Nonetheless , Morris notes , there 's a possible source for such gas clouds : a ring of gas , about 6 light-years in diameter , that encircles the galactic core . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star birth at the galaxy 's center , he speculates . <p> As Morris envisions it , the gravity of the supermassive black hole lures the ring inward , compressing parts of the rings gas to enormously high densities . When the ring approaches the center , its density might be high enough to form stars like the massive ones that astronomers have recently imaged . <p> Massive stars often have fierce winds , notes Morris . In the Milky Way , such winds might have pushed the ring back outwards , where it now resides . However , a few million years from now , after the massive stars at the core have died out and the winds have vanished , the black hole may pull the ring of gas back toward it , ripe for yet another round of star formation . <p> MIGRATING STARS For scientists who are reluctant to justify a change in the common view of how dense gas clouds near supermassive black holes can behave , there 's another scenario . In this model , notes Morris , the stars now in the neighborhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main challenge to this model is that if these massive stars formed beyond the gravitational grasp of the black hole , they must have traveled to the center in a hurry or they would have burned out . If each star were initially a member of a heavy , tightly bound cluster , however , this fast migration would be possible . A cluster that forms some 10 to 30 light-years from the core would lose energy as it passes through fields of stars and spiral rapidly inward , lured by the collective mass of all the stars and gas that lie closer to the galactic center . If the cluster were still intact as it came within 4 light-years of the core , within the gravitational grasp of the supermassive black hole , it would soon disintegrate , spilling its stars into orbits around the black hole . <p> There 's now evidence that such clusters exist . Over the past decade , researchers have found two stellar groupings that lie within 100 light-years of the galaxy 's center . If such a cluster of stars were to migrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black hole 's tidal forces could split it up . Jo that case , the cluster 's most massive members , now traveling solo or perhaps in pairs , would journey even further inward . <p> In an upcoming Astrophysical Journal , Andrew Gould of Ohio State University in Columbus and Alice C. Quillen of the University of Rochester in New York describe details of one such migration scenario . Their model focuses on the final step  --  a cluster of stars that rips apart as it comes within 0.1 light-year of the supermassive black <p> The researchers calculate that for a massive star from that cluster to come as close to the galactic center as the stars that Ghez ' and Genzel 's teams have studied , it must have a partner several times as heavy perhaps 60 times the sun 's mass . The black hole at the galaxy 's center will ultimately disrupt this pas de deux , and in some cases , will capture the lighter star into an orbit about 25 times as large as that of Pluto , Gould and Quillen say . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that the massive , short-lived stars found at the galactic center may have had companions that were even more massive and therefore shorter lived . That would mean that the stars that now closely orbit our galaxy 's supermassive black hole are widows of much more massive stars . <p> These survivors could harbor important clues about their former megapartners . Little is known about the evolution of such extreme heavyweights , but cosmologists speculate that such stars first lit up the universe almost 13 billion years ago . <p> After considering all the known populations of stars that lie near the Milky Way 's core , Brad Hansen of UCLA and Milos Milosavijevic of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena find that none can exert a strong enough gravitational tug to rapidly draw in a group of massive , short-lived stars born a few light-years from the core . Instead , the astronomers propose in an article posted online June 3 ( http : **35;1985;TOOLONG ) the most likely gravitational source is an unidentified intermediate-mass black hole , some 1,000 to 10,000 times the mass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermassive black hole , could easily form at the center of a dense star cluster that formed farther out and then sank towards the center , dragging young stars along with it , the researchers note . <p> Supporting evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole may come from high-resolution radio wave maps that track the motion of the supermassive black hole at the galaxy 's core . Its motion across the sky would be slightly altered by the presence of an intermediate-mass black-hole companion , Hansen and Milosavljevic suggest . <p> Making that model more credible is the first evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole residing near our galaxy 's center . Morris and his collaborators have made as yet unpublished observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory that hint that such a black hole resides about a light-year from the core , Morris told Science News . <p> YOUTHFUL MASQUERADE In early May , Ghez latched onto another hypothesis that she thought might solve the conundrum of the central stars . <p> In this model , the stars that her team has observed are n't really young and massive . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much longer-lived , they could have formed far from the galaxy 's core and then taken hundreds of millions of years to migrate there . <p> To flesh out this idea , Ghez says , " we need some kind of astronomical Botox , some way of making stars look young when they 're , in fact , old : ' One potential mechanism for such a disguise intrigues Ghez : Bash together two elderly stars known as red giants . Although they 're no more massive than the sun , these stars have bloated atmospheres . A collision would blast away the stars ' atmospheres and expose their hot , bright cores . From a telescopic perspective , such a stripped-down star , which looks hot and bright , could well be mistaken for a young , massive star , notes Ghez . <p> The model would also appear to explain one puzzling feature of the stars nearest the supermassive black hole . No two orbits lie in the same plane . Multiple collisions involving red giants and other stars might yield the random orbits her team has observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News , she was no longer confident of that model 's promise . Calculations by other astronomers have shown that red giants whose envelopes are stripped by collisions cool down in 10,000 years  --  a mere blink of an eye in astronomical terms . That means the youthful-looking stars that closely orbit the supermassive black hole are too hot to have formed this way . <p> Furthermore , a closer analysis by Ghez and her colleagues has revealed that the orbits of the close-in stars are not random in all their properties . Although no orbit is in the same plane as another , all the orbits are elongated and many are elongated in roughly the same direction . <p> Researchers have proposed other explanations for how old stars at the galactic center may look young . In one model , several elderly , low-mass stars merge to form a single massive body that appears bright and young . A more exotic model posits the existence of small black holes not far from the supermassive one at the galactic center . Each of these black holes might attract gas and stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescope , the combination of a small black hole and an atmosphere could resemble a young star . <p> " Scientifically , this has been one of the most exciting few weeks of my life , " says Ghez . " I 've been bouncing ideas off colleagues , and we 're all trying to come up with a satisfying theory . " <p> Whatever the solution to the mystery of the massive stars in the galaxy 's middle , the answer " is bound to be a new and incredibly interesting twist on how star formation and movement can take place in the extreme environment surrounding a supermassive black hole ' says Morris . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : BULL 'S EYE  --  X ray image shows the region within 10 light years of the center of the Milky Way X-ray glow emanates from an extended cloud of hot gas surrounding the supermassive black note at the galaxy 's core , indicated by arrow . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : CENTRAL CLUSTER  --  The Arches a cluster of stars about 30 light years from the galactic enter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , massive stars circling the supermassive black hole at our galaxy 's core . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : AROUND AND AROUND  --  Orbits of some of the stars closest to the supermassive black hole at our galaxy 's center . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : CLOSE-IN STARS  --  Our galaxy 's supermassive black hole appears as the bright spot at the center of this radio wave map of the central Milky Way .
