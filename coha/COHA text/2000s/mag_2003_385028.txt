TABLE <p> LOCK UP your sons and daughters , John Wesley is riding into town ! According to Roy Hattersley , Wesley was a man of " dubious conduct . " Maybe he was even a psychologically disturbed religious megalomaniac who used the Methodist movement as a vehicle for establishing his own status and salvation . <p> As a man , Wesley was " silly about women " and " remained , into old age , dangerously susceptible to every woman who seemed to admire him , " Hattersley charges . His relationships were characterized by " emotional irresponsibility " and even bordered on " emotional masochism . " Perhaps the problem of sexual impotence accounted for his " juvenile pursuit of women " well into middle age ? <p> As a theologian , Wesley was " not an original thinker " but " susceptible to whatever influence was most recently upon him , " to the point of being " intellectually footloose , " according to Hattersley . If " women were his weakness , doctrinal promiscuity was his abiding sin . " He had " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the man to allow a malign purpose to prevent the endorsement of a convenient conclusion . " Wesley was a pragmatist after all , for whom theology at times " had to be forgotten in order to attract men and women who were frightened by long words and complicated ideas . " <p> As a pastor , Wesley was intolerably superstitious : he actually believed in supernatural realities and miracles . And he held that all of life was subject to the providence of God . As a result , he had the habit of " taking piety too far " and seemed " incapable of experiencing , or even understanding , normal human emotions . " It is also likely that Wesley was a hypochondriac and a valetudinarian who reveled in the self-absorption of ill health . <p> As a leader , Wesley possessed an " unscrupulous determination never to admit that he had been wrong " : he " intimidated ( as well as influenced ) those around him " and " constantly sought to deceive others . " Indeed , he was a tyrannical autocrat who " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that calls for democracy must immediately be crushed . " The fact is , Hattersley says , " Methodism was made up as it went along  --  very largely inside John Wesley 's troubled mind "  --  and was then governed by his " ruthless organization . " In short , Wesley was a capricious and egocentric attention seeker . <p> As a work of modem criticism Hattersleys biography seeks to present the historical Wesley warts and all , with the objectivity of an outsider 's point of view . But there is no such thing as neutral reporting , not even from the pen of a former British Labor Party politician turned Lord of the Realm like Hattersley . It is clear that he reads his sources through the lenses of a self-confessed atheism and the secular prejudices of modern psychosocial categories . <p> To this Methodist scholar it seems that the author portrays a " tabloid " version of Wesley 's life : sensational and sweepingly judgmental ; often historically inaccurate ; and largely ignorant of the research of Wesley scholars over the past few decades . <p> Ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hattersley may be led to conclusions very different from his . Many will not find it strange that Wesley could , innocently desire female companionship and even the sexual intimacy of marriage , while struggling to accept his true calling to a single life . Many will find it strange that the author condemns Wesley for being both unyieldingly dogmatic and pragmatically susceptible to doctrinal revision . The combination of openness and conviction can be seen as admirable qualities in a Christian leader . <p> Many will not find it strange that Wesley refused to break " new intellectual ground , " if that meant joining the rationalists or latitudinarians in suspending the authority of scripture and Christian orthodoxy . Many will find it strange that the author continually portrays the ambiguities of Wesley 's leadership in Machiavellian terms , rather than in terms of the subtle complexities of sustaining a renewal movement within the Church of England while striving for a genuine catholic spirit . <p> Many will not find it strange that Wesley chose to live and minister to others as though what he professed to believe about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great flaw of Hattersley 's book is that he ruthlessly sacrifices balanced judgment and plain coherence in order to cast Wesley in the worst possible light . <p> To his credit , the author does draw upon a broad range of primary sources in the Wesley corpus and a fair number of important secondary works . Despite attempts to separate " fact from fable , " however , his substantial reliance upon older texts , combined with his unquestionable talent for storytelling , leads to some repetition of half-truth and legend . <p> Hattersley does a decent job of summarizing complicated historical events and theological ideas , placing them carefully within the wider social context of 18th-century England , and still managing to keep the whole account interesting . At its best , the biography highlights many important modulations in Wesley 's life and thought : Wesley 's own spiritual and theological journey ; the controversies over doctrine and practice within the Methodist movement itself ; the struggle to resist schism from the Church of England ; and the development of American Methodism into an independent church . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the classic work " on Wesley will either succeed for all the wrong , reasons or-fail on scholarly grounds . Its usefulness as an antidote to Methodist hagiography is seriously hampered by the unrelenting and unwarranted assassination of Wesley 's character . Hattersley finds nothing much good to say about him and finally dismisses any lasting significance of early Methodism as a whole , except , perhaps , as an embarrassing precursor to the influence of 19th-century Methodism on working-class Britain . <p> Historians will be constantly frustrated by the book 's ubiquitous historical and typographical errors  --  from Wesley 's christening name in 1703 to the place of his near death experience in 1775 . And theologians will be dissatisfied with the often confused treatment of key doctrinal questions , especially what Wesley means by real Christianity and its relation to the pursuit of perfect love . <p> Finally , pastors will be disappointed by the scant attention paid to the means of grace ; the practices of disciplined small-group fellowship ; , the way Methodist societies worshiped ; the contributions of lay leaders in the movement ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among many others , have been the lasting gifts of Wesleyan discipleship and spirituality to the church as a whole . <p> Reviewed by Philip R.
