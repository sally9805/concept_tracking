The Porch 1999 I began putting my life back together at the feet of my older sister and her family . She lived in Momma 's housethe family shrineon the front beach of Sullivan 's Island . Every time I went over to the Islandwhich was frequent in the first months after Tom leftI tried to leave the harsh realities of my new life behind me . My old station wagon rolled slowly across the causeway , liberating my daughter and me from the starched life of the peninsula to the tiny dream kingdom of Sullivan 's Island . Black magic and cunja powder swirled invisibly in the air . The sheer mist became the milky fog of my past . From within the pink and white branches of the overgrown oleanders , which lined both sides of the road , floated the spirits of decades long gone . The haints were still there , just waiting for us in the tall grasses and bushes . Suffice it to say that everything in the Lowcountry was just a-wiggling with life and it was n't always a warm body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breathe in the musk-laden drug of the marsh . The scents of plough mud and rotting marsh life filled my senses like a warm shower of rare perfume . Then the sirens sounded their cue and the drawbridge lifted up before us to allow passage for a tall-masted sailboat . We would be detained on the Charleston side for fifteen minutes . I left my car to stand outside and feel the air . Beth stayed in the car listening to the radio . I walked to the edge of the marsh.The full force of the salty air washed my face and , in an instant , I was a young girl again . I was hurrying home to my momma and Livvie , my heart already there . The sweet steam of Livvie 's simmering okra soup beckoned in a long finger all the way from the back porch . In my mind I heard the voices of my brothers and my sister as we converged on the supper table , all of us bickering in Gullah over the largest piece of cornbread . Livvie ran interference , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was odd what I remembered about growing up . My first associations were tied into the smells of the marsh and the aromas of the kitchen . Maybe I should have done fragrance research instead of planning literacy programs at the county library , but I was always more inclined toward saving the world . One thing was for sure , I needed a job that would let me offer my opinions because , according to everybody I knew , that was one area where I excelled . Livvie . God , not a day passed that I did n't remember her . She raised meall of us , actually . Here was an old Gullah woman who put her own five children through college working as a housekeeper . Just when she should have been thinking retirement , she took on the notorious clan of Hamilton hardheaded ignoramuses . She was the captain of our destiny , redirecting our course as often as needed . With every snap of her fingers we woke up to the truths of life and our own potential a little more . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd shake her head and lecture . " Feast your hungry brain with a good book , " she 'd say . " Quit wasting time ! Life 's short . Humph ! " Humph , indeed . Who was I kidding ? It was because of her that we were not all in some treatment program . She had taught us how to thinkno small feat . She 'd probably have had plenty to say if she could have seen Beth and me right now , playing instead of working . I 'd told my boss I had a doctor 's appointment . A tiny lie . But I had an excellent excuse for playing hooky on this particular weekday afternoon . Heat . Over one hundred degrees every day since last week . We were having a heat wave , Lowcountry style . It felt as if old-fashioned southern cooks were deep-frying us in bubbling oil like a bunch of breaded chickens . One flip of the wrist and the whole of Charleston and its barrier islands sizzled in a cast-iron skillet . We 're talking hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Geechee ? That would be someone born in the Lowcountry , which extends from the Ogeechee River down in Georgia clear up to Georgetown , South Carolina . I was raised in the downy bosom of the Gullah culture , as opposed to a Charlestonian reared in the strictures of the Episcopal Church . Big difference . Gullah culture ? Ah , Gullah . It 's Lowcountry magic . That 's all . Coming to the Island made me feel younger , a little more reckless , and as I finally went back to my car and closed the doorpausing one moment to lower the audio assault of the radioI realized the Island also made me lighthearted . I was willingly becoming re-addicted . As we arrived on the Island , I pointed out the signs of summer 's early arrival to Beth , my fourteen-year-old certified volcano . " Oh , my Lord , look ! There 's Mrs. Schroeder ! " I said . " I ca n't believe she 's still alive . " The old woman was draped over her porch swing in her housecoat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mom ? She 's an old goat ! " " Well , honey , when you 're an old goat like her , you will . Look at her , poor old thing with that wet rag , trying to cool her neck . Good Lord . What a life . " " Shuh ! Dawg life better , iffin you ask me ! " I smiled at her . Beth 's Gullah was n't great , but we were working on it . " This ' eah life done been plan by Gawd 's hand , chile , " I said . It was a small but important blessing how the Gullah language of my youth had become a communication link to her . A budding teenager was a terrible curse for a single parent , especially given the exotic possibilities of our family 's gene pool . But speaking Gullah had become a swift ramp to her soul . Gullah was the Creole language developed by West Africans when they were brought to the Lowcountry as slaves . While it mostly used English words in our lifetime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most especially it had many unforgettable idiomatic expressions . It was spoken by Livvie , taught to us , and we passed on the tradition to our own children . We used it to speak endearing words to each other , to end a small disagreement or to ignite memories of the tender time we spent with Livvie . When I was Beth 's age every kid on the Island spoke Gullah to some extent , at least those lucky enough to have someone like Livvie . I stopped at the corner for some gas at Buddy 's Gulf Station , the Island institution renowned for price gouging on everything from gasoline to cigarettes . We got out of the car , I to perform the elegant task of pumping the gas and Beth to get a cold Coke . A group of old Island salts were ogling the thermometer in front of Buddy 's store . One of the old men called out to Buddy . " Jesus ! If it 's this hot in June , what 's August gone be like ? " " Gone sell y'all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gone be hotter than the hinges on the back door of hell , that 's what ! " the old man shot back . " Humph ! " I smiled , listening to them . They sounded the same as Islanders had sounded for generations , same accent , same lilt in their speech . Traces of Gullah phrasing . It was my favorite music . As we drove down the Island I decided to take Atlantic Avenue to check the horizon , watch the shrimp boats and container ships . Today 's slow ride did not disappoint us . Boats were everywhere . I pointed them out to Beth . It was the whole world , these container ships , coming and going from our busy port as they had done for centuries . She nodded with me in agreement . First , that it was beautiful , second , that we were lucky to be there . Along our drive by the water , we passed ten or so young mothers pulling their offspring home in wagons from the sweltering beaches , hopping from one bare foot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid is that ? " Beth said . " What ? " " Shoot , Momma , even I know not to go to the beach without flip-flops or sandals ! God , they must be dying ! " " Please . Do n't use the Lord 's name , unless you 're in prayer . It 's a hundred years in purgatory . " " You do . " " I 'm an adult and personally responsible for my own immortal soul . " " Whatever . " She made one of those sounds of disgust , the kind that could be confused with indigestion , used for running defense against parental dominance . Beth . This child got the cream of our genetic smorgasbord . She inherited the Asalit blue eyes , a shade of chestnut hair with more red and wave than mine , my brains and grapefruits ( bosoms ) , Maggie 's tiny waist and when she finally stops growing she could be five feet , nine inches . She was a colt , all legs and a shiny coat , looking for a place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked it too , pulling all her poor momma 's chains . " Two hundred years of Catholicism coursing in your veins is gon na make a lady out of you if it 's the last thing I do , " I said . " Well , at least you 're not trying to make me a nun , " she said with some relief . " Honey , I would n't encourage my worst enemy to the doors of a convent . " " Come on , Momma , step on it . I 'm dying to go to the beach ! It 's so hot I could scream ! " I was just cruising along , enjoying the scene before me and looking around to see if I knew anyone . The Island had changed so much from when I was a child , but thankfully all the attempts to make it slick like Hilton Head or Kiawah had failed . Part of me depended on that . If it stayed the same I still owned it , even though my sister , Maggie , got the Island Gamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mother closed her eyes for the last time . I got the haunted mirror and that seemed like a fair trade to me . The rest of us had always known Maggie would walk those floors in adulthood . She would raise her children within the same rooms . Tradition was as much a part of her makeup as rebellion was of ours . Digging roots off the Island had been essential to my sanity . I would have tied that house up in a bow and given it to her rather than live there . There were too many ghosts in the paneling , too many tears in the pipes . I had too much energy to stay , and back then I had no desire to reconcile the issues . No , there was no argument from me on who should get the house . If Maggie wanted itand I would never understand why until I was well into my thirtiesit was just fine with me . I had run an entire seven miles away from home to Charleston . But seven miles from this Island was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard next to Maggie and Grant 's boat and tooted the horn to announce our arrival . The back door swung open and Maggie called down to us from the back porch . " Susan ! Beth ! Where have y'all been ? " She waved , smiling at seeing us . She looked frighteningly like a nineties version of June Cleaver , Beaver 's mom , only with frosted blond hair . I hated to admit it , but she was beautiful and always had been . She had Bermuda blue eyes like all the Asalits . A natural blond toned to a perfect size six , she was pleased to no end with her life . Maggie was hopelessly lost in a Talbot 's world of flowered skirts and hand-knitted sweaters . She was the president of the Garden Club and active with the Junior League . Even though we disagreed on everything from politics to the merits of duck decoy collecting , when her blue eyes met mine , we were family . " Getting gas at Buddy 's and smelling the marsh , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got caught by the bridge again . " " That awful old bridge ! Y'all come on in ! Beth , the boys are waiting . You want to go crabbing ? Tide 's perfect ! " " Ab ! I brought my bathing suit . " Beth grabbed her straw beach bag and pushed past us to find her cousins . " In the parlance of today 's young people , ab is short for absolutely , " I said . " God , is it hot or what ? Thanks for letting us invade your afternoon . I thought I was gone die in Charleston . It 's so hot in the city the blacktop sinks under your feet . " " Y'all moving in ? Let me help you with some of that . " " Thanks , " I said . I followed her up the steep steps into the kitchen ; my eyes struggled to adjust to the low light inside . " I hate the heat too . Well , this summer 's gon na be a scorcher , I guess . You want something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refrigerator and pulled out a pitcher of iced tea . " Please . " I reached for two glasses from the cabinet and handed them to her . " No Diet Pepsi ? " " Picky , picky . No , I have to go to the store . " " Tea 's fine . I 'm gon na change into some shorts and hit the porch . " " Okay . Wan na go for a swim ? " " Maybe later . First I have to calm down and cool off . " " Tom ? " Maggie cleared her throat with a knowing " ahem . " I hated that little " ahem " thing she did . " Who else ? " I leaned against the counter as she poured , feeling embarrassed that my whole life had spun clean out of control . " What 's happened now ? " " Maggie , you should 've been a shrink . I ca n't keep dumping stories on you about him . I 'm gon na drive you crazy . Let 's just say that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a long drink of the tea . " Thanks . I 'll meet you on the porch . Can you sit awhile ? " " You bet . Let me just start the dishwasher and marinate the steaks for tonight . Grant got a new grill for Father 's Day and wants to break it in . " " I wish he 'd break it in by putting Tom Hayes 's behind on a spit , " I said , thinking that I 'd been muttering a lot lately . " See you on the porch . " I sprawled out in her Pawley 's Island hammock , using my heel to kick off from the porch banister . The hammock , a testimony to the practical application of macram , was like all the ones that have hung on the western end of this porch since I was a child . Hammocks were generally undervalued , except in the South and probably the Amazon . There was nothing like crawling in , stretching out and swinging away your troubles . I closed my eyes and began daydreaming about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my house in the city , it would be a veranda . But over here on the Island , it was a porch . That general lack of pretension was one more feature that made the Island so appealing . I could be blinded and still find everything here . If I hopped out of the hammock , I could take three steps and sink into one of the two old metal frame chairs , the kind that bounced a little . There was an ancient coffee table between the chairs and the glider . If I wanted to perch in the bench swing that hangs from the other end , or park myself in a rocker , I would only have to stretch out my right arm and follow the ferns that Maggie had hung in perfect intervals above the banister . The only differences between the porch of today and the one of forty years ago were the ceiling fans that moved the air around , making the suffocating heat bearable , and the fresh coat of paint on the furniture and the floor . In my day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorate , Grant painted . The porch used to be entirely screened in with doors to the outside , but Grant and Maggie took them off . The house looked wonderful without them and nobody seemed to mind an occasional yellow jacket . Even the most persnickety old-timers on the Island agreed that Maggie and Grant had done a great job with the house . You have to understand that the old Islanders were highly suspicious of any sort of change . Busybodies . After all , Grant was from Columbia , and what in the world would he know about historic beach houses ? But , they crept around , one by one , with a pound cake or some fresh fish as a house gift , to see what Maggie and Grant were up to . In the end , they all said that Maggie and Grant had done all right . Like many of the older houses on the Island , this one had its own name : the Island Gamble . Living on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean , our house had its own tide that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , went mad . Everything inside and outside was suffused with the smell of salt water and sea life . The Island Gamble was very nearly a living , breathing thing . Our mother 's parents , Sophie and Tipa Asalit , were its second owners , its first being a lady of dubious background . Legend holds that she entertained a handsome sea captain here for a prolonged period of time while her husband was in Philadelphia on business . It must 've been true , because when Tipa and our father renovated the house they found torrid love letters between the floorboards and thousands and thousands of Confederate dollars . Island Gamble . Our grandmother had always hated the name . She said it made us sound like a bunch of hooligans . The argument was one of the few times that our grandfather ever stood up to her , that I knew of anyway . He insisted that the name not be changed , suggesting it was tampering with history to remove it . Lord knows why he picked that battle to fight , given the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Island Gamble has belonged to our family for nearly one hundred years . At first it was our family 's summer house , but when Grandma Sophie became frail , Tipa moved her from the city to the beach permanently , believing the salt air would do her some good . The Island Gamble was a sentinel ; she stood tall with a commanding view of Charleston harbor and Fort Sumter . Her white clapboards made up three stories , built in the old Island style that only God could pull asunder . Her wide hips were wraparound porches and her French doors swung open for airflow . The most interesting original details were her cupola and widow 's walk on the top of the house . They sat up there like a bonnet on her lovely head . When I was little , I used to climb up there to hide from everyone to write in my journals , privacy being a precious commodity in those days . In our family , the birth of every new baby was preceded by a building frenzy . Our grandfather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides or off the back like a line of freight train cars . Our house was kind of crazy looking , the patchwork quilt of our family 's history . She gave the impression she could withstand anything and , indeed , she had weathered scores of hurricanes , sheltered many broken hearts and played host to hundreds of people in her history . Her heart had harbored too many secrets for my blood , but I seemed to be the only one really bothered by that . " Oh , if these walls could talk ... " people would say . And I 'd say , If these walls started talking , the entire Island would be put under quarantine while the government moved in an army of psychiatrists . But there were marvelous things about this place too . The hammock , for one , was extremely comforting , and Maggie was a great friend to let me come here to nurse my wounded heart . I did n't sleep too well these days with all that I 'd had on my mind . I tossed and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visualization of this porch and hammock always helped me make headway toward some peace . Just as I was about to drift off for a little desperately needed shut-eye , the screen door slammed . " You want me to paint your toenails ? " Maggie had arrived to cure me with a cosmetics bag and a tray of food . I looked down at my feet and shrugged in agreement . " They look bad , ' eah ? Whatcha got in that basket ? Feed me , I 'm starving . " ' Eah . Great Gullah word , versatile like anything . It means here , yes , right now , do you hear me , is n't it so , do n't you agree and just about anything you want it to . " You do n't look to me like you 're starving , although you do look thinner , " she said . " Okay , you can paint my toenails if it makes you feel better . " These days , if anyone told me I looked thinner , I became the most agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hammock and inspected the snacks . " Sit ' eah and I 'll pour you some more tea . " I took a stalk of celery and dipped it in fat-free ranch dressing . Maggie pointed to the glider for me to sit in and began a replay of our childhood ritual . She wadded up pieces of Kleenex and stuck them between my toes . Then she moaned in disgust about my corns and calluses , while she buffed them away . Next , she lectured me on cuticles while she clipped and finally , thank the Lord , she applied a base coat followed by two layers of some color she got as a gift with purchase from Lancme . She always felt better when she could work on my appearance . " I 've lost twelve pounds , " I told her as she applied the top coat . " I see it in your ankles . " Of course , if she lost twelve pounds , she 'd look cadaverous . " Thanks a lot , " I said . " I can see it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a diet counselor from Jenny Craig . " Listen , twelve pounds is a lot , ' eah ? Turkeys weigh twelve pounds ! How 'd you do it ? " " Swell . I 've only got a few more turkeys to go . I 'm counting fat grams . Can I have a tomato ? " " Well , you 're looking much better ! " Maggie twisted the top of the nail polish bottle back in place and offered me the Sweetgrass basket filled with raw vegetables . " ' Eah , try one . They 're fabulous ! " I got up carefully , trying not to wreck my pedicure , chose a deep red one , and hobbled back to the hammock . Twisting off the stem , I chomped through its rosy skin like an apple . The juice escaped at once and ran down my chin , seeds and all . I lifted the hem of my T-shirt , exposing my **30;474;TOOLONG pink stomach , and wiped my face . Maggie watched , just shaking her head . What did she know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ femme fatale . Okay . Truth . I knew my ability to break hearts was momentarily eclipsed by my unfortunate girth . I ignored her and lost myself in the joyous simplicity of munching on a perfectly vine-ripened tomato . " Damn ! This is so good ! Dee-vine ! Where 'd you get ' em ? Are they Better Boys ? " " Yep . Mr. Andregg brought ' em over from his garden as a thank-you for ten pounds of blue mackerel the boys and Grant caught last week . " She reached for a tomato for herself , wrapped it in a napkin , and took a small bite . No drip . I ignored that too . " Keep those boys in the river ! Where 's the salt shaker ? " " You do n't need salt . Bad for your blood pressure and makes you retain water . " " Right . You 're right . So I only have a thousand more pounds to go and I 'll look like my old self . Any suggestions ? I mean , I 'm starving myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrinking with glacier speed ... " " Forget fat grams ... just eat what you want in moderation . " " I ca n't forget them if I ever want to get laid again , " I said under my breath . I sat up a bit and looked out over the railing toward the ocean . The sight always took my breath away . The dark green velvet of the front yard contrasted with the radiant white of the sand dunes that separated the family 's property from the beach . The white mounds cut a wavy line across the deep blue of the Atlantic , like the finger paint of a child in his first attempt to create something beautiful . Feathery sea oats grew in clumps across their tops . The water glistened and the sun danced on the phosphorus . An illusory field of diamonds . " You know , this must be the most beautiful place on this earth , " I said , realizing my voice was barely a whisper . " I hope you do n't talk like that in front of my niece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , Susan , your reference to your sex life . Beth does n't need to ' eah that . " " Maggie , my sex life is nonexistent . Besides , she 's barely fourteen ! Beth is clueless about that stuff . " " Trust me . She 's not clueless . Remember when you were fourteen and had that mad crush on Simon ? " " I need a cigarette . Where 'd you hide my purse ? " " It 's under the hammock . I wish you would n't smoke . It 's nasty . " I nearly fell out of the hammock trying to reach my purse and , finally having retrieved it , I dug out my Marlboro Lights and my old Zippo . I lit it and exhaled away from Maggie . " Give it up , Maggie , " I said . " You ca n't cure me in one day . " " I 'm not trying to cure you , " she said with all the indignation of an older sister , " but you should try the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in case you have n't noticed . " " Right . Have you heard from Simon lately ? " " Not since Christmas . Let 's call him . He 's living in Atlanta now , you know . Who knows ? Maybe his marriage is on the rocks ! " I had to giggle at the thought of calling Simon . " I 've got my cell phone right ' eah ! Got his number ? " I said with bravado . " No , but I 've got yours . Big talker . " " Oh , well . " She raised her eyebrows at me . Maggie had been a saint since Tom left me three months ago , but with the single lift of that brow , she let me know she knew I was a chicken . " You 're right . I 'm not ready for men yet , even Simon . Men still stink . " I drained my glass and flicked my cigarette butt over the rail , regretting it the second I did it , knowing it landed in her roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't worry about it . " " Yeah , Simon . God , he was cute , ' eah ? I 'd love to see him again . Maybe that little girl he married ran away or something . " " Well , his card did n't say anything about her , just that he was in Atlanta to teach a course on rare viruses and fevers or something at Emory . " " Oh . Do you know that man has n't written me in over ten years ? " " Call him . " " Yeah , right . " Simon , Simon , I thought . I wondered if he still had all his hair . When he was young he had the almighty head of silky brown hair . God , I loved him , for years and years . He must be fifty by now . I felt the heat surge again . Although the tide was coming in , there was n't a breath of air to be had . " Guess who did call ? " I said . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she could answer . " Our dahlin ' baby brother ? What 's up with him ? " " Well , bless his mercenary little heart , he just wanted to know if I needed anything . Is that nice , or what ? " " It 's out of character , that 's what , " Maggie said . " Well , normally I would be highly suspicious , but he was sincere , I think . Maybe Paula does n't have any more plastic surgery left to do and he does n't know what to do with his money . " " We 're terrible , " Maggie said . " Yeah . " The heat was paralyzing . " Maggie , was it this hot when we were kids ? I do n't remember it ever being this hot . " " I hate to break this to you , but you 're getting older . Have you had your estrogen checked ? " I looked over at her stirring her tea like the Queen of England . I took the bait . " Estrogen ? Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication of menopause is a broken thermostat . It 's either that or your weight . In any case , if you do n't do something , you could be dead by August . " " God , middle age is an unending insult . " I closed my eyes and pretended to nap . It took about two seconds for me to sense her towering over me , her and her " **44;506;TOOLONG " lips . I opened my weary eyes . " What is it ? " I said rather testily . " What now ? " She just stood there , feigning mild offense , waiting for me to beg her to tell me how to fix my life . Her wheels cranked and turned in her head over the gentle rustling of the palmetto fronds and the incoming waves . She drove me crazy sometimes . " Nothing , " Her Highness said , and heaved a deep sigh . She sighed the same way our mother used to . An unfair advantage . " Come on , Maggie , spit it out . You 're gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the coffee table and poured me another glass of tea . She dropped a lemon in the glass and handed it to me . I pushed it in with my finger , realizing I was being a little difficult . " Okay , I 'm sorry , " I said . " I admit it . Nobody has ever done more for me than Livvie Singleton and you . So tell me what you 're thinking , besides that it would be nice if it were eighty degrees instead of a billion . " " Susan , you have a serious opportunity here . " I just stared at her . " You do , " she said . " Come on , let 's rock . " " What do you mean opportunity ' ? What I 've got is a daughter with probable simmering hormones , a stack of bills you could lay end on end to Charlotte that Tom wo n't help me pay , a backside that looks like thunderous Jell-O , no matter how I starve the thing . All I do is worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time finding the opportunity in all this . " I was prepared to mount my high horse now and she knew it . I took a seat in the rocker next to her . " The butt 's easy to fix , just walk to work instead of driving . " She was perfectly calm , as though dealing with the borderline deranged , " You 're probably right ... " " And the exercise would do you a world of good , give you a chance to think about how to handle the rest of the stuff . Exercise is good for your brain . " " I know . You 're right , you 're right , you 're right . But , Maggie , it 's easier for you to see what I need to do than it is for me to do it ! " " Susan , listen ' eah ! Do you know how many women would trade in their husbands if they had the gonads ? " " Yeah , but I never wanted to trade Tom , he traded me , remember ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you gon na do about it ? First of all , it 's been three months . Do you have a separation agreement yet ? " " No , I 'm not ready for that . " " Well , if he wanted to come home , would you let him ? " I looked out at the ocean again , remembering the good things about my marriage to Tom . The way he kissed , the way it felt to be in his arms . But then , I remembered finding him in bed with his young thing and I felt my heartbeat quicken from the anxiety of his betrayal . I drained my glass . The boulder in my throat made it hard to talk about a separation agreement . " Remember how Livvie used to say that if you rocked a chair when you were n't in it , you rocked away your life ? " I said . " That always spooked me . " I avoided giving the decision and Maggie was having no part of it . " Because you were wasting time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else , Livvie Singleton would beat you to a pulp if she could see the time you 're wasting now . She raised us to spit in the faces of those who did us wrong , not to get fat and depressed and lie around moaning . Tom Hayes is a bum and the sooner you realize it and do something about it , the sooner you can rebuild your life . If Livvie was ' eah , she 'd tell you to buck up ! " " Do n't mince words now . Tell me how you really feel . " " I 'm sorry , Susan , it needs to be said . You 're my closest sister and I love you . Now , for once and for all , if Tom came to you and said he was sorry , would you take him back ? Please , think this through , because if you 'd forgive him , so would I. " I had given hundreds of hours of thought to how it would be if Tom came home . I might forgive him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust him again . A good marriage was impossible without trust , I knew that . " No , I 'd never take him back now , Maggie . No , it went too far and he 's just been awful to us . He 's the one who screwed another woman in our bed and walked out . " " Are you absolutely sure ? " " Yes , I 'm sure . If I took him back , he 'd just do it again the first time some bubble wit lifts her Wonder Bra in his direction . Who needs it ? " " You 're ready . I 'll get you a list of lawyers and you can start interviewing them next week . " " Okay . " I inhaled the healing salt of the beach and exhaled my soured marriage . " I just hate dealing with this , you know ? ' " I know , I do n't blame you for that at all . " Maggie reached over , patted my arm and continued .

Sounds to me like he 's the loser , not you . " " I hope he rots in hell . " " That 's the spirit ! " Maggie started cleaning up . She took our glasses and put them on the tray and , balancing it , wiped the tabletop with a napkin . " You need a new haircut . " Having someone who always told me what I needed was a little exasperating , but I knew it did n't pay to call her on it . " You 're right , I need to do something about my looks . But that tightwad I need to serve with papers still has the five bucks his Aunt Helen gave him for his tenth birthday ! I need another job or something .

Where are our children ? It 's getting late . " " You just relax , I can handle this . I guess they 'll be home soon . Listen , if they caught anything , why do n't you stay for supper ? Crab cocktails and grilled steaks ? Not the worst meal on earth . " " Sounds good , " I said . " Hey , Maggie ? " I stared at her while I dug around for the right words . " I 'm gon na get a lawyer . I just have to find the right person and I have to find my nerve , you know ? " " Since when have you had a problem finding nerve ? " " Very funny . What I mean to say is that I really appreciate your advice . " She smiled at me . " Well , you know your own mind . You always have . I just do n't want to see you victimized again . " " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina and was too bullheaded to see it . " " Well put by the family poet ! " Maggie smiled at me again . " I just want you to be yourself again , you know ? Like a bad dog , chasing cars . I miss that about you . I mean , what would you do if you could do anything with your life ? Like , change careers ? " She balanced the tray on her hip , held the screen door open and challenged me to come clean . " I do n't know . Maybe ... oh , shoot , Maggie , I do n't know . " " Well , think about it , little sister . There 's a new world out there if you want it . Seize the day and all that . Livvie did n't raise us to wallow . " " You 're right . Hey , you know , on the growing list of things I intend to do with my life is another tidbit . " " Yeah , what 's that ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She ran her fingers through her hair and looked at me like I had said something foul . " Give it up , Susan , " she said . " Daddy 's been dead for decades . " " That 's not it , Maggie , " I said . " I just have to know that I did n't cause it . " " Susan . I 'm your sister . I love you .... " " I know that .... " " You need to concentrate on other things . Daddy died of a heart attack . Period . " I hated when she looked at me like that , taking the posture that her word was the final one on the subject . So I said , " It ai n't period . It 's a question I have to resolve for my own soul . " " Suit yourself . But I think your time 's better spent on other avenues , " she said . " Whatever . But , I 'm telling you I know in my guts that Daddy was murdered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this planet who loves you more than me but I 'm telling you I ca n't stand to listen to this . " " Maggie , " I said , " I ca n't stand to think it . I have to know that the fight did n't cause him to die . I have to believe it was the Klan . " " What is this fight you always refer to ? I do n't know what you 're talking about ! " She was becoming agitated . It was suddenly clear that for some reason she did n't remember the fight . Maybe she had blocked it from her mind . I did n't know . I just wanted the waters smooth again . " Never mind , " I said , " I 'll figure it out someday . " " Well , my advice is worry about the living . The dead had their chance . " " Whoa , that 's cold , " I said . " No , it 's not . I care about you and Beth . That 's all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loud thwack and the sound of wood slapping wood woke me up like a sock in the jaw . Maggie had just succinctly reduced my life to an ancient Latin maxim and some hard facts . She was right about Livvie too . Livvie would be incensed to have seen me rolling around in my despair of chocolate chip cookies and fast food for the past three months . Maggie was always right . When all hell broke loose , Maggie was right there at my side . She 'd taken Beth under her wing too . She had listened to me wail and moan ad nauseam . It was enough now . I looked defeated and that had never been a word in my vocabulary . It 's just that my head was in gridlock at the thought of a new life . I was a little afraid , you know ? What if I failed ? What if I could n't take care of Beth ? What if she went wild and flunked out of school and got pregnant ? What if this was all there was ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ! I peeled myself up from the rocker , knowing the slats had left their imprint on the back of my legs . I decided to throw one leg over the banister and straddled it like a horse , hanging on to a support beam , the same way I did when I was a child . The tide was almost high and its power was mesmerizing . I wished I could have some of it for myself . The waves had now grown from the baby hiccups they were at low tide to crashing rollers , and washed everything in their path with silvery foam . They began down at the eastern end of the Island at Breach Inlet . Danger , danger . People drowned in whirlpools and ebb tides there every year in spite of posted warnings . Did n't people read ? I knew that attempting to investigate Daddy 's death was dangerous too , but the compulsion to do so was growing each day . Of all the stones I carried in the sack tied to my heart , his death was the heaviest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the guilt stemmed from being the only one who seemed to care if he had died at all , never mind how . Added to that was . Tom 's deception , which only exacerbated my thirst for truth . The waves arrived in stacked sets of three , the current driving them in on an angle . As they reached our end of the Island , they seemed to calm in the faint , sweeping beams of the lighthouse . Turning tides were hypnotic . The water flooded the shore in anger , then turned , withdrew and renewed itself . The beams from the lighthouse grew in intensity , spreading protection for boats at sea . It was in these moments that I was sure there was a God . He was tapping me on my stubborn shoulder , telling me the scene before me was a metaphor for my own life . Withdraw and renew ; life goes on . Maybe Beth and I would stay for dinner , crack some crabs , grill steaks and shoot the breeze . Maggie was right . I needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old dog still hunt ? I could just see Beth and Maggie 's boys now , coming down the beach in silhouette against the edge of dusk . They were swinging a basket of crabs and a bucket of bait . It could have been a photograph of our childhood , the happy days . So many days I spent with Maggie , Timmy and Henry , catching fish and crabs , throwing plough mud at each other ... those were , I think , my happiest memories . We 'd come home all sunburned and sticky and present Momma and Livvie with our catch of the day . They 'd act like we were heroes for feeding the family . We were so proud . And then there was our daddy , Big Hank.
