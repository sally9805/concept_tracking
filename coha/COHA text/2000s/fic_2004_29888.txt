RING AROUND MY HEART By Pat White Dorchester Publishing Pat White " Loverboy , this is our new PR gal , " Cosmo said . " She 's coming on board to redefine things a little . Teach you how to behave in public . " " Jesus , Cosmo , I 'm a grown man . I know how to behave , " he said , snatching a T-shirt from his duffel bag . She took a few steps toward him , wanting to see his face again , cursing her terrible memory . She had the absolute worst memory when it came to faces and names . Although selective memory came in handy when she wanted to forget nights of forced passion with the Ex . " Alexandra Hayes . " She stuck out her hand . He looked at it , then narrowed his eyes . " And you know who I am . " Arrogance dripped from his voice . " Loverboy Luke Silver , " she said , the name sounding all wrong . She withdrew her hand and gazed into his striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One too many cups of coffee no doubt . Loverboy glanced away and rifled through his bag . " Have we met before ? " she asked . He turned to her , a slight curve to his mouth . " Lady , that is the sorriest excuse for a pick-up line I 've ever heard . Even I gave that one up years ago . " " I 'm serious . " " So am I , sweet cheeks . " He winked , grabbed his bag and headed for the dressing alcove . She followed him . " You called me Lexy , " she said . " Got you mixed up with someoneelse . " He started into the alcove and she touched his shoulder . Glancing down at her hand , a wry smile played across his lips . " Sorry , Babe , there 's only room for one . " " But- " He ripped the curtain closed . Drat . She did n't know what she hated more-not knowing who this man was , or having to deal with his cocky attitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in order to do her job she needed to know everything about Mr. Loverboy . She had to focus on his strengths and mask his weaknesses , know him inside and out , anticipate his response to things and teach him new , appropriate responses . " I was n't done talking to you , " she called through the curtain . Nothing . " Mr. Loverboy ? " He was purposely ignoring her . An all too familiar feeling . She ripped open the curtain . " Hey ! " he protested . He 'd slipped on a navy T-shirt but still wore the terry towel around his waist . " She 's the one who needs a lesson in manners , Cosmo . " " How do I know you ? " she asked . " Obviously not well enough , " he smiled , then snapped the towel from his waist . Any other woman would probably swoon at the sight of him , semi-hard and , she suspected , larger than most . Unfortunately sexuality was non-existent in Alexandra 's libido , yet another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife being lukewarm about something as sizzling as sex . Oh well , there were worse things than having an orgasm disorder . Like being unemployed and childless , if she failed to earn a decent living . She wavered at the thought . " She 's goin ' down ! " One of the wrestlers called . " I 'm fine , " she said , staring into Loverboy 's eyes , her fingers gripping the curtain for support . She would n't let him think his hard body had any effect on her . " Must be low blood sugar , " she said . " I 've got some candy , if you 're interested . " The twinkle in Loverboy 's eyes made her want to slap him upside the head . " Oh , you do , do you ? " Cosmo cupped her elbow and snapped the curtain shut . " My fault , my fault . They need their downtime after a match . Let 's wait outside . He 'll be easier to talk to when he 's not crowded . " Cosmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this mess of condoms , " Loverboy ordered the other wrestlers . Alexandra heard the metal rings of the dressing curtain scrape open . She glanced over her shoulder at Loverboy . " I 've got my own supply . " He looked her straight in the eye and shot her a half smile , a wolf 's smile . " Now if I could only find someone to help me break them in . " She shook her head and wondered how on earth she was going to work with this man . Cosmo led her into the hallway . " Sorry about that , " he said . " See , that 's what I mean . The boy needs a lesson in how to deal with people . " Cosmo shoved his hands into his blazer pockets . " No need to apologize . He does n't scare me . " She waved him off and leaned against the cement wall . " You sure ? You looked a little pale in there . " She stood straight . " Mr. Perini , do n't think a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm immune . " " Excuse me ? " " Never mind . Let 's focus on business . I 'd like to see your storylines for the next three months and your promotional schedule for Mr. Loverboy . " She paced a few steps and back again . Think , plan , execute . Keep your mind trained to the objective . Shoo away the nagging thoughts brought on by the utterance of a childhood nickname . Lexy . The name evoked memories of Checkers , her cock-a-poo , the tire swing out back in the old house , and her little brother , Christian , hooking himself to the dog run and sailing into the neighbor 's rose bushes . Lexy . Who had called her that ? " I 'll get you the story lines ASAP , " Cosmo said . " The promotional schedule is nil at present . Once he turns from heel to hero and the fans take to him , we 'll set up a tour . " She remembered the blonde bimbos falling over themselves to get to the wrestler . Obviously the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain this to me again , " she said , pulling a small notebook from her briefcase . " He seems awfully popular as he is . " " Popular as a heel . We want him to get over with the fans as a hero . " " Get over what ? " " That means , get popular with the fans . " " But he 's popular now , is n't he ? " " We need a hero , a good guy who can draw that kind of loyalty . Wrestling has n't had a baby face like that since the Hulkster back in the 80 's . Only a handful of guys have that kind of charisma , and Loverboy Luke is one of them . I 'm telling you , if we do n't do something radical , we 're going to lose all our fans to Steel 's Outrageous Wrestling . I ca n't stand the thought . That 's not wrestling , it 's porn . " The door to the locker room swung open and Loverboy sauntered out , buttoning the cuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You still here ? Let me guess , you want a one-on-one with yours truly . " She stood tall , but still barely came up to the breast pocket of his shirt . " Sorry to disappoint you , Mr. Loverboy , but this is strictly business . " " I 'm sorry to hear that . " With that mischievous smile , his eyes roamed the contours of her body . She fought back the anger-induced adrenalin rush and narrowed her eyes in warning . " I 'm hiring her to straighten you out , " Cosmo said . " You 're going to be seeing a lot of each other . " " I know what I need right now , Cosmo , and it is n't lessons on how to talk , walk , or handle the media . Now , if she were offering something else ... " Her heart pounded with irritation . He was too close . The man did n't know the meaning of personal space . " But then I have a feeling she 's the one needing lessons in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gritted her teeth . For the first time in months she felt that familiar burn bubbling in her stomach , and once again the words caught in her throat . " I 'm outta here , " he said . Loverboy walked away , awfully fast in her opinion . Why did she get the feeling he wanted to escape her presence more than he wanted a hot and willing woman ? She shoved the notebook into her purse . He probably could n't stand the thought of being around a cold , asexual creature . He had to sense it . " Disturbing . " That was the word David had used . Disturbing and devastating to his ego . If men valued anything , it was their egos . " Loverboy , hang on . " Cosmo chased after him , his loafers scuffling across the cement floor . " I want you to go with this one , kid . It 's important . " " It 's a waste of time . " " I do n't think so . " Cosmo hesitated . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You threatening me , Cosmo ? Is that what you 're doing ? " He dropped his duffel bag to the floor and backed Cosmo against the wall . Alexandra automatically took a step back and she was a good fifteen feet away . Scary when provoked . She made a mental note of that . Cosmo 's eyes widened and he swallowed hard . " It 's not a threat , it 's a reality check . We need to carve out a new piece of the market . If you want to keep fighting we need to make changes . " " What kind of changes ? " " New characters , new heroes , " Cosmo said . " I could never do that . " " You 've got to try . " " Bullshit . I 'll quit first . " Alexandra stared at him in disbelief . The man was morally opposed to becoming a good guy ? " Think real hard about this , kid , " Cosmo said . Loverboy clenched his jaw , then marched towards Alexandra . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed down way too many times . This was business and represented a big job , big money and a way to protect her son . He closed in and her legs started to move on their own volition-backward . She held firm , planted her hands on her hips and cocked her chin up a notch . Towering over her , the scent of musk after-shave tickled her nose . If he got any closer he 'd be inside her . " Go back to wherever you came from , little girl . I 'm not working with you now , tomorrow or ever . Got it ? " he said , his turquoise eyes a blaze . She held firm , but did n't speak . No sense provoking him further . He marched away , damp hair trailing down his back . The man was madder than a penned bobcat and probably just as dangerous-to the wrong person . But for all his grunting and physical intimidation she sensed he would n't hurt her physically . Something told her he was a gentle man , but he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the heck did she know about men anyway ? Especially this one ? Loverboy stormed past the waiting press and adoring fans that 'd been lucky enough to snag backstage passes . The steel door slammed behind him . She looked at Cosmo . " He 'll come around , " he assured , leading her toward the exit where a cab was waiting . " You still interested ? " He chewed nervously at his lower lip . Cosmo reminded her a little of Dad : well meaning , but not completely together . She smiled . " Do n't worry , Cosmo . I can handle him . By the end of our three-month contract you 'll know you 've made the right decision . " Now , if she could only convince herself of that . ( Continues ... ) by Pat White
