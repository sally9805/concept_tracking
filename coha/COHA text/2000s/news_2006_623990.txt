<p> The boy is not a Martian , he 's just white . <p> That 's what the sage black surgeon tells his daughter in the newish movie " Something New . " It 's a romantic comedy about a driven African American accounting executive who 's torn between her desire to find the " IBM "  --  the ideal black male  --  and her attraction to a sweet blond , blue-eyed landscaper who rubs against the expectations of her upper-middle class black milieu . He 's definitely not the cat to bring to the black cotillion . <p> " Do I know women like her ? Absolutely . I identified with the character , " says Sanaa Lathan , the actress who plays the lead role of Kenya in " Something New . " It was written by a black woman , Kriss Turner , and directed by Sanna Hamri , who calls herself a real African American : Her father is Moroccan and her mother is a gringo . <p> Lathan has dated white guys and felt the draft of resentment and racism from both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of older black men , the unease of a white boyfriend 's liberal parents , her reluctance to bring the guy to black gatherings and the relief a few people in her family felt when the couple called it quits . Lathan knows the movies about a black man and a white woman  --  " Jungle Fever " comes blazing to mind  --  but with the exception of small films like " Zebrahead , " she 'd never seen the reverse portrayed onscreen , from a black woman 's perspective . <p> " That 's huge , " said the actress , on the horn from her Los Angeles home . <p> If statistics mean anything , according to Newsweek , 13 percent of African American men marry outside their race , compared to 5 percent of African American women . Black women are more reluctant to date outside their community , Lathan says . <p> " There is a sense of guilt , a sense of abandoning our black brothers . You feel it from yourself and from the community . It goes way back to our history in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black women . It 's a very painful past that 's still in us to this day . It 's almost easier to date somebody who 's not white , like a Latino , " she added , because the black-white symbolism " is way more loaded . " <p> The whole " male-female dynamic " comes into play , too , Hamri adds by phone from her Los Angeles office . Men have always had more freedom . " A man sleeps around , he 's a stud , a woman is a whore , " the director says . " Take that simple premise , that formula , and if you add the race thing , it becomes even more of a deadly potion . " <p> Lathan has stressed over the situation in the past , " but I do n't think I 'd have that feeling if I fell in love with a white man now . I would n't care what other people think . I love this movie because it 's not saying you should be in an interracial relationship ; it 's saying you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> That 's what timpanist Elayne Jones did in 1953 , when she married George Kaufman . He was a young New York doctor whose Orthodox Jewish parents sat shivah  --  the traditional seven-day mourning ritual  --  when they learned their son was marrying a black woman . For them , he was dead . <p> " This gorgeous Jewish man in love with me ? I could n't believe it , " says Jones , a Harlem-born Julliard graduate who was the first black musician to play with the New York Philharmonic and who retired from the San Francisco Opera orchestra in 1998 . <p> Jones was playing drums in a little swing band at a progressive Adirondacks resort in the summer of ' 52 when she locked eyes with a dark-haired man in the crowd . As luck had it , another guest played drums and sat in so Jones could slip onto the open-air dance floor . <p> " I met George and we started dancing , " recalls Jones , a small , lively 78-year-old who has a nifty two-tone hairdo  --  blond top , copper-brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aplomb . She 's sipping coffee in her Rossmoor retirement condo in Walnut Creek , picturing that distant August night . " It was such a beautiful place , and the moon was so beautiful . Everything was just perfect . Oh , it was very romantic . " <p> The couple married five months later and made a rich life for themselves and their three kids in St. Albans , a racially mixed section of Queens . They were close with other interracial couples and deeply involved in progressive politics . The late Kaufman , to whom Jones was married for 10 years , became a leader of the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , attended to beat-up civil rights workers in the South and organized a demonstration that got more black people hired at the 1964 World 's Fair . <p> Jones played with the New York City Opera , and in the American Symphony under Leopold Stokowski . A picture of her and the maestro hangs on her living room wall , along with a signed photo of her old tennis partner Luciano Pavarotti ; images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jones with her children , grandchildren and great-grandchildren  --  a cross-cultural clan of many shades . Her fair-haired , blue-eyed granddaughter Hyacinth is married to a man from Mexico . Jones moved back from New York last year to be close to her brood . <p> She never met her in-laws . But her parents , immigrants from Barbados , embraced her marriage to Dr. K. <p> " They never instilled in me this thing about color , " says Jones , whose mother wanted to be a pianist but worked as a domestic . " There were no black ( classical ) pianists back in the ' 20s , " she says . " No Andre Watts . She always said to me , ' I do n't want you to clean white people 's floors . You 're going to do something respectable . ' " <p> As a teenager , Jones occasionally dated black men , but at the time , " I was not considered pretty by black standards , " she says . " I was dark-skinned , had thick lips , my hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had to look like Lena Horne . " She was rejected by one kid whose mother said she was n't pretty enough . " Those things really made me focus on my music . And through my music I met George . He was attracted to my music . " <p> After the couple split , Kaufman married a Christian woman , got deep into the church and cut off contact with his former wife and children after they moved to San Francisco in the early ' 70s , when Seiji Ozawa hired Jones for the Symphony . Her son is violinist Stephen Kaufman , a street performer known as Thoth who was the subject of the 2002 Oscar-winning documentary of the same name . In the film , he speaks about the loving , interracial world he grew up in , and the disillusionment he felt when he got to know the larger , mean world we all live in . <p> " My girls did n't seem to suffer that much , " says Jones , whose daughter Harriet is a UC-trained midwife who lives in Ghana with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheryl , is a schoolteacher who lives in Sacramento with her second husband , an African American . Years ago Cheryl was married to a Caucasian guy . Jones opposed that union . <p> " Not because he was white , but because he did n't fit into our family , " she says . It was the green that bothered her . " He was a Vietnam vet who joined the Green Berets . We were a progressive family , into the arts . All my friends ' sons were off in the war resistance or going to Sweden or Canada . And my daughter should come home with a guy that volunteered in the Green Berets ? I do n't think race is the question . It 's what your goals are , who you are . " <p> Jones , a good-humored atheist who started a secular humanist group at Rossmoor , has taken flak from some black people who consider classical music , her great love , " white music . " New York felt less accepting when she returned there in ' 98 . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to identify yourself with what you like , and follow your heart . Suppose you like Beethoven . You should be able to go and pursue Beethoven . You might like hip-hop . I do n't like hip-hop . Does that mean I 'm not a black person ? I still know who I am . But I have a choice about what I want to do . " <p> As for romance , " If we think in terms of what we needed , given our inner strength , we would n't be thinking in terms of race , " says Jones , who 's had her share of heartbreak . " Love should be the only thing you focus on . " Jones breaks into song : " Because love makes the world go ' round . " <p> Gary and Alicia Radnich fell for each other a decade ago , got hitched and have two beautiful young daughters . <p> A lot of people on the street recognize Radnich 's big cheery mug . He 's the veteran KRON-TV sportscaster and KNBR talk show host who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jibes . But once in a while , when he 's out with his wife , he feels someone 's gaze lingering longer than usual . <p> Radnich likes to turn around with a smile and ask , " Excuse me , is she too black or too young ? " <p> The flustered party usually blurts out something like , " Oh , no , she 's a beautiful girl , " Radnich says . " That stops ' ' em right there . " <p> He and his family are dining on seafood salad at Fisherman 's Grotto No. 9 on the Wharf , one of their hangouts . Padrone Mike Geraldi coos over the kids in their brown and pink polka-dot dresses  --  Jolie is 6 , Isabella , 21 months  --  <p> and takes them over to see the fish tank so the folks can talk . <p> The couple met in ' 94 at KRON , where Alicia became a writer and producer . She was leery of office romances . But Radnich happened . " I fell in love with Gary , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his spirit . He 's a kind man . He has a really great sense of humor , and I think I 've a good sense of humor . I married my best friend . He has a little bit of soul , and that does n't hurt . " <p> Race was n't an issue , she says . " It was never a question of , ' Oh my gosh , he 's Caucasian . ' I grew up in West Los Angeles in a diverse , multicultural neighborhood . My mom was a teacher , and she raised us to accept and embrace all ethnicities , all cultures . " <p> Radnich was drawn to Alicia  --  " I got a kick out of her , and what the hell , she 's pretty good-lookin ' , too , " he says  --  but wanted to take it slow . He 'd been divorced for about five years after a 15-year marriage that produced three kids , now grown . He was n't looking to get hitched . <p> His caution , he says , had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference that gave him pause . At 55 , he 's 17 years older than Alicia . <p> " I said , ' Kid , if you ca n't find anybody else , stick with me . If you can find somebody younger , a little better guy , go ahead . If you ca n't , I 'm not going anyplace . ' " <p> " And here we are , " she chimes in , " all these years later . " <p> Unlike some checkerboard couples , these two encountered no resistance from their respective families . Once Alicia 's grandma Nana gave Gary the thumbs up , the rest of her family was cool . <p> " She loved him immediately , " Alicia says , " and she does n't like too many people . " <p> Radnich 's folks were equally supportive . He was very close with his late father , William Radunich , a one-time boxer , rancher and pest-control guy whose father had immigrated from Belgrade . Gary 's mom is a Santa Barbara gal of Scottish stock . <p> " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about time , ' " Radnich recalls . " Here 's a guy who 's pretty set in his ways , and a 17-year younger black woman is in love with ( his son ) . You could see where that would jolt you a little bit . But they never said a word . " <p> Radnich grew up in San Jose , where he spent summers playing basketball on city playgrounds with black guys . He was good , ( Radnich went on to play at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas ) and sought out the best players to test his skills . Skin tone did n't matter , he says . " If you were a black guy and could n't play  --  my brutha , nothin ' , get him off the court and get a white guy in here who can play . " <p> Racist remarks occasionally come his way . After seeing a picture of his family in a newspaper story about his 20th year on KRON , Radnich got a letter from a guy who said he could n't be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was black . He brushes it off . Some people are just ignorant , he shrugs . <p> " When it comes down to it , everybody wants the same thing , whether you 're black or white . Everybody wants to be respected , everybody wants to be able to pay the rent , everybody wants to have somebody to love and somebody to love them . " As for the rest of it , " who cares ? " <p> On occasion , Alicia has been mistaken for her daughters ' nanny . One woman asked how long she 'd been taking care of Jolie . <p> " Since she was conceived , " replied Alicia . She mentions her brother , who 's married to a fair-skinned Venezuelan woman . Because mom 's white and dad 's black , his kids wanted to know " what are we ? " He answered by pouring chocolate syrup over vanilla ice cream and mixing it up . " You ca n't separate it now , " he told his kids .
