Hellfire hallelujah and halitosis . Mike Schmidt sits to pee . How you doing , fuckface ? My name 's Henry Tobias Toohey . I love Jesus , rock and roll , and Grace McClain but not in that order . Can I get an amen ? Can I get a witness ? I come to you in the Holy Name of God , Yahweh , the Big Finger , the Eye in the Sky , He Be Who Be . He came to me in a vision and gave me a mission of love . He said : Henry , make Grace your wife . Sing to her and propose marriage in front of a wedding reception crowd . Do it for her love , for your parents to fall back in love , and for your depressed older brother to snap out of his sad sleep . Is that all , Big Fella ? Not a problem . Your Will Be Done . Good morning , St. Patrick Street . Good morning , Philadelphia . City of brotherly love . City of dead-end and one-way streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opportunity for criminals both organized and unorganized . Home of the Phillies , Flyers , Sixers , and Eagles , in that fucking order .

I leave anybody out ? Tough break , fuckheads . It 's a perfect Friday morning on the last weekend of summer vacation , 1984 . The sun punches through the NFL curtains on the window of the bedroom I share with my older brother , Stephen Joseph Toohey , who 's eighteen and a drunk . Stephen sleeps below me on thebottom bunk . He 's snoring loud , has puke on his pillow , and most likely does n't remember last night 's fistfight with our dad , Francis Nathaniel Toohey Junior . Stephen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fight Night with the Tooheys , every night . In this corner , standing five-nine , weighing a buck fifty , looking lost to everybody , is the underdog , Stephen Toohey . The Pug with the Lonely Mug . In the opposite corner , standing five-seven , weighing a buck eighty , and having more hair on his back than on his head is our champion , Francis Nathaniel Toohey Junior . Francis the Fighting Mailman . I want a clean fight , fellas . No rabbit punches no clinches . Keep quiet so the neighbors do n't call the cops again , so Cecilia Regina Toohey Senior and Cecilia Regina Toohey Junior , AKA Cece , do n't cry . Please refrain from punching Francis Nathaniel Toohey III when he comes inside the living room from his house next door to break up the brawl . Most important , keep the action away from the television , which has recently been equipped with cable . Knocking over a cable television is more of a mortal sin than pissing in a priest 's chalice , so if you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Philadelphia Phillies alarm clock says ten-thirty . Damn . I 'm supposed to meet my best pal Bobby James now . I 'm not worried , though . I 'll be down there in an hour after I get dressed and comb my hair . Before I do anything , though , I have to deal with Mike Schmidt . I guess I should explain who he is in case you are either A ) a broad or B ) a fella who plays with dollies . Mike Schmidt plays third for the Phillies and is my mortal enemy for reasons I do n't care to discuss right now due to personal inner pain . I 'm trying to get on with my life since the Incident . Bull's-eye . The spitball I shoot at his poster hits him square in his big honker , the fucker , next to hundreds of other spitballs . I do this every morning . It 's therapy . I 'm already feeling better . I walk down the hallway toward my parents ' bedroom straight ahead , past Cece 's bedroom and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection , like my hair , is spectacular . She owns every album made between 1950 and 1979 . Stacks of LPs line the walls , and 45s are stuffed in spilling cabinets . I go to the 45s  --  wo n't be time to hear an album . What do I feel like ? Here we go : " Let It Hang Out ( Let It All Hang Out ) " by the Hombres . Good tune . I pull it out of the sleeve and walk to the record player in Cece 's room , where our band , Phillies Alarm Clock , practices . I drop the needle . The song starts with a sermon . It also has handclaps . I dance and sing along in my white underwear . Tell me the truth : have you ever seen such rhythm in a honky ? Say yeah . Make me laugh . " Henry , shut the fuck up and turn that down , " yells Stephen from his bed . I lower the volume , stop singing , and do the hustle backwards to the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing . A quick check for armpit hair reveals none . No stubble on the face either . Fuck a duck , I 'm thinking , as Stephen staggers into the bathroom , kneels in front of the bowl , and pukes . " Yo . Henry , there 's something wrong with you . You know that , do n't you ? " Stephen has bright green eyes , even when he pukes in the bowl after a bender . His black hair is a wet , spiked mess . He 's five-nine , handsome , but not like I am . Far as handsome goes , I 'm in my own freaking league . Ask any broad , or me . " Yo . How do you figure ? " I ask , as I soak my head under the sink faucet . " Where would I start ? The music . The hair combing . The preaching . " He pukes . " I was n't preaching . That was part of the record . I was singing along , jerk-off . " " Maybe so , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff TV preachers say . " " So what ? " I ask . " They 're funny . Do n't you think so ? " I watch preachers on cable and dig their clothes and hairstyles . If I 'm not watching preachers , it 's stand-up comedians . Same thing , really , except comedians have bad hair or bald heads and ca n't dress for shit , the fucks . " I would n't know , " he says . " I do n't watch them . " Puke . " Do n't know what you 're missing , " I tell him . " If you say so , " he says . " I like it better when you imitate the stand-up comedy . " " I do n't imitate nobody , you fucking fuckball . Stay here , " I say , then walk pissed to our bedroom and open my top dresser drawer , where a box protects Big Green , my comb . Once I open the lid , remove a brown bag , unzip a sandwich bag , and unroll a wad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appears . " What 's up , pal ? " I say . Yeah , I talk to my comb . Fuck you . Big Green , a man of action , says nothing . I walk him to the bathroom , where Stephen now sleeps on the rim of the bowl . He put on fifteen pounds since he left high school last June with a diploma he 'll need to cover his head when he 's sleeping on the street in the rain , which is what Francis Junior has been threatening him with . Stephen started drinking a year ago after his girlfriend Megan died in a car crash up the block . Then he quit football a month later , for his senior year . His grades dropped . His personality disappeared . He was always funny before . He made everybody laugh , he made everybody feel better about themselves , about life , especially me . He was my hero . He always stepped in to stop a bullshit fight with a couple jokes . He was never not smiling . A room buzzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom dropped out on him . Francis Junior got involved , and it 's been downhill from there . Stephen drinks , comes home , throws hands with Francis Junior , and passes out . He wakes up the next day , pukes in the toilet , falls asleep on the toilet , wakes up , and asks me questions about the night before , which he does n't remember . " Henry , you seen Daddy this morning ? " asks Stephen . " No , " I say . " Ai n't seen him since you two fought last night . " " What ? " he asks . " When did we fight ? " " You 're kidding , right ? " " No . I remember coming in and having a hard time climbing the stairs . " I rub two globs of gel into my hair . Next , I comb the hair straight back . I 'm ready to make a part in the middle , but I want to tell Stephen what the fuck happened last night . I can only do one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen or the hair otherwise . " You did have trouble getting up the stairs , " I say . " Yeah , see , I told you , " he says , relieved . " Daddy and Frannie carried you upstairs . You were out cold . So you could say you had a hard or easy time , depending on how you look at it . " " Seriously ? " " Seriously . " " Daddy go after me or I go after him ? " he asks . " I do n't know , " I tell him . " I was on the top step , filling out a fight card , eating jujubees and malty balls . " " Shut up . What I say to him ? " " Do n't really remember . Fuck you , fuck off , jerk-off , cocksucker . The usual . " " I mention Daddy porking Mrs. Cooney behind Mommy 's back ? " asks Stephen . Francis Junior is cheating on his wife , our mom , Cecilia Regina Toohey Senior , with Mrs. Cooney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the other end of the block . We 're the last house on this side . If St. Patrick Street was a rectangle , a straight path from the Tooheys ' to the Cooneys ' would cut it in half into two triangles . " No , nothing like that , " I say . " Did Mommy cry ? " " Yup . " " Shit . What else happen ? " All of a sudden I 'm not up for telling him more . First off , I still have n't parted the hair . Second , I still have n't parted the hair . So I let him off easy . Mentioning the police visit or his sobbing wo n't do any good right now . Have to get to the hair here . " It was n't that bad , " I say . " You knocked over some shit is about all . " " So that was it ? You sure I did n't say nothing stupid in front of Mommy ? " " I 'm sure . She knows anyway , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out for her . There 's a thing called class . " He pukes . " Look , this has been real , " I say , " but I got ta fix the hair , buddy . Go back to bed . " " Yeah , I 'm gon na right after this , " he says , then dry heaves . " There , that 's better . Have a good day , young Henry . Put some clothes on . You go out like that , broads will run from everywhere to shove dollar bills in your BVDs . " He walks back to our bedroom , moaning and muttering that life blows , in a scary-nervous voice . The idea of broads shoving bucks in my trunks excites me . Now I have a boner , standing at the bathroom mirror in my white underwear . Look at this fucking thing . I wish I knew how to get rid of them . I need to hit the library . Time to get my mind off the boner and back to the hair . It ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampooing so I can start from scratch , but I 'm not that desperate . I 'm not what you 'd call a bather . I part and feather the hair  --  piece of cake  --  then spray . Here 's a tip : when you spray your hair , do n't pay attention to instructions on the can . Let it rip for three minutes straight . You want the bathroom in a cloud of haze so thick that you fart and mistake it for a foghorn . Done and done . Now that the hair 's complete it 's time to dress . But first a quick review of my hair and fashion tips . Showering every day is overrated . There 's no need . I stick to Mondays , Wednesdays , and Saturdays . Sundays are Days of the Lord , and it should be noted that vain exercises like bathing are sins . However , hair care and not bathing are only two steps to looking and feeling great . Step three is picking an outfit that separates you from the herd . How ? Simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or feed slop to pigs . Try a collared shirt with buttons like the one I 'm putting on now . No one will find one as cool as mine , what with all the moose on the shirt , but the point is to find one that says you like a shirt full of moose says me . Ignore those gurgling and snorting noises Stephen makes . Choosing shorts is simple . With a moose shirt it only makes sense to wear plaid shorts . No way a broad like Grace can resist . For shoes I 'll wear black sneakers with yellow racing stripes . They throw off the color scheme I got going , but it does n't kill you if the shoes do n't match the rest . Next , I tuck Big Green inside a tube sock for quick-draw access . Finally , no outfit is complete without some article of clothing that praises Jehovah somewhere . I go low-key with scapulars , which are like two cloth stamps with pictures of saints attached to shoestrings . You wear scapulars like a double necklace , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautiful thing : scapulars are a get-out-of-Hell-free card , guaranteed . You die wearing scapulars , you go straight to Heaven , no questions asked . For instance , say today I go outside , hijack a bus , and , I do n't know , run over old ladies with walkers . Then I get off the bus and empty the change out of their purses . I take that money , go to the bar , get drunk . At the bar , I start an argument with a fella about who 's better looking , me or Bobby Redford . He says me by a little . I say me by a lot . I go back outside , get behind the bus wheel , come through the bar wall , and run him over . I take money out of his wallet , walk over to the juke , and punch up the song " Old Time Rock &; Roll " by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band . I sit back down , order another drink , and start another argument with another fella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says De Niro by a little . I say De Niro by a lot . I end that argument also by running him the fuck over with the bus . I settle in for another drink . De Niro walks in the bar , sits down next to me , orders a shot , and knocks it back like the badass he is . He squints and asks , You talking about me ? Were you talking about me ? I tell him Yeah , but I was saying good things , Bobby . He is n't buying that shit . He pulls out a big-ass Mob gun , blows me full of holes . I 'm dead but wearing scapulars . After all that , the question is , do scapulars save me from Hell ? Yes and no . Ordinarily I 'd go straight to Heaven , even if I passed through the Pearly Gates holding the bus steering wheel and a cold beer . But we forgot the worst sin of all . Worse than murder , or missing Mass even . I played Bob Seger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit . The living room is a mess . A lamp lays on the floor next to the overturned coffee table and spilt magazines . Plastic covers on the sofa and love seat are n't fastened firmly . At least the television and cable box are safe . I grab the remote off the cable box and push the power button . It 's the usual shit heap : talk shows that 'd be funnier if folks fistfought , music videos with German jerk-offs playing pianos like guitars , cooking shows hosted by fat broads , black-and-white reruns , soap operas , and game shows . Finally I find a Jesus channel , where a preacher with high Elvis hair , ruffled shirt , and powder blue tuxedo holds the fat hands of a whale woman with tits like two waterbeds . The whale woman with the waterbed tits blubbers . She lost Jesus somewhere but found Him again , praise God . The preacher smiles and sweats . The audience applauds and shouts shit . I flick off the TV . Then back on . Then back off . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outside , a dog growls , and a man yells in pain . I run to the front porch , where my dog Gwen Flaggart is biting the mailman , who 's also my dad , Francis Nathaniel Toohey Junior . Francis Junior calls Flaggart a fat bitch as she chomps his ankle . " Yo , Dad , " I say . " Got a package for me today ? " Me and Bobby James placed an order in the back of MAD Magazine for a ton of shit including , but not limited to , plastic dog doo , trick gum , smoke pellets , and a hovercraft . We 're going to ride the hovercraft to school . Hovercrafts get chicks . " Yo , Henry , " he says . " What ? You talking about this ? " He pulls a small brown box out of his stuffed mailbag and hands it to me while Flaggart growls and bites . He points his dog spray at her and lets go with the juice . Bam . Flaggart , one ugly bitch , rolls on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneezes , her yellow fangs looking almost like a smile . " Get her in the house before I kill her , Henry , " he says . I open the door and he kicks her in the ass . Inside , she bitch-strolls over to Gene , our other dog , who 's sleeping . Gene wakes up , spots Flaggart , and moves . Flaggart sits down in his warm lost place . Me and Francis Junior stay outside on the porch . " Henry , is Stephen still asleep upstairs ? " he asks . " Nah , " I say , " he was awake . " " How 's he doing ? " " Not too good . He 's puking . " " I figured that . I meant did he seem upset ? Sad ? " " Yeah , but he 's always that , " I say . " I know , " replies Francis Junior , who looks exactly like Stephen with a gut , less hair , a fatter face , and dark circles under his eyes . " He mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did he ? Wow , " says Francis Junior . " Maybe something I said sunk in . " " Yeah , OK , Dad , " I say , patient , although he 's dumb to think that . " You understand my point about school and shit , do n't you ? " " Sure . " Up the street , Bobby James pokes his fat head out his door and looks toward my house but is too blind to spot me from this far . This is good because if he saw me he 'd throw a hissy fit . Once he goes back inside , the phone rings behind me . " I got ta stay on his shit now , Henry , " says Francis Junior . " He 's drifting . Ca n't let one heartbreak break you , goddammit . Life blows , that 's a fact , but it moves on and you have to too . He should play ball and go to college . You too . I do n't want you lugging junk mail and running from dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hear you , brother , " I say . " Stop being funny . I 'm serious now . This job ai n't easy , " he answers , a faraway look in his eyes . This means he 's launching into a speech , which he has to stop here and there to answer questions about the mail from the neighbors . " Henry , I just want to see you get more than I got out of life  --  Hello , Mildred , yes your Reader 's Digest came in , I 'll be right there  --  I was working at the Post Office when I was sixteen , Henry , I only got a break from that to go to Vietnam  --  Harry , that insurance check did n't come today , I 'll keep looking for it , I promise  --  your brother ai n't thinking straight and will kick himself later for bad decisions he makes now  --  Eunice , I 'll be there in two minutes , for crying out loud , you toothless old coot  --  you 're even smarter than Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catering halls when you could be reading important books at college , chasing skirts , away from all this noise and nonsense . I ca n't let Stephen throw everything away because his high school sweetheart died . I carried my baby brother dead out of my own house when I was seventeen and he was seven . I had work the next day . I went . Life was waiting . If I got ta fight your brother to keep him on this planet , I will , goddammit  --  Yes , my own dog bit me , Mike  --  look , I have to go before these people light torches and chase me down for the mail . Your hair looks fine ; you can put that thing away . Listen , what are you doing with yourself today ? " " The usual , " I say . " Hanging with Bobby James . Looking for chicks and loose change . Professing my love for Yahweh out loud . " I always say shit like this because he does n't listen . " Write your mom a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You got any money ? " " Do I ever ? " He pulls out his wallet , which has three ripped one-dollar bills . He hands me two , looks at the last bill , then hands me that too . " Here , " he says . " Thanks , pal . " " Do n't mention it . " " Dad , " I say , switching gears , " why would a fella pork another broad behind his wife 's back ? " " What ? " he asks , almost jumping out of his sneaks before dropping his bag to bend down and retie them and not look at me . " Why do you ask ? " " No reason , " I say . " Somebody mentioned it the other day up at the playground . " " Who were they talking about ? " " I forget . Not you . " " I was n't thinking me , " he says , standing up , putting his bag back on his shoulder . " I know , " I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? " " Yeah , something like that . Look , I got ta move . Be good today . " " You too . " Francis Junior leaves to finish the street , climbing porch railings with his legs windmilling like he 's a gymnast . I watch him for a minute , then walk back in the house , find a pen and paper , and write , " Ma , I went out . I 'll be back . Yours in Christ , Henry . " Cecilia will laugh at that . She likes Jesus jokes . I click off the television with the remote , then turn it on and off again . Remote controls . Wow . It 's five minutes to noon . The phone rings in the kitchen . Stephen pukes and moans upstairs . The needle scratches at the 45 I never turned off . I step out into the sweet summer air . The sunshine hits me with the warmth of Yahweh 's infinite love .               @ @ @ @ @ @
