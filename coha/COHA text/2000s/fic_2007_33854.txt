Sword paused on the path below the pavilion , an empty jug in his hand . Standing a few yards past the brewer 's house that marked the end of the village 's central cluster of homes , he leaned forward , listening . He thought at first it might just be an echo of someone speaking up in the pavilion , that rambling ridgetop structure that served as the village 's communal storehouse and gathering place , but the direction was wrong even for an echo . In all the years he had lived here , all the hundreds of times he had walked this path , he had never before encountered such an auditory illusion . Then he thought he might be imagining it , or hearing spirit voices rather than anything physical , but no , he could definitely hear something happening far ahead , off to the left , in the trees-not in the pavilion or anywhere else in the village lands , but in the trees beyond the edge of town . It was n't birds , he was sure , nor squirrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , human ones , and much rustling and thrashing . He frowned , wondering what that was about . There were n't any homes or fields down that way ; the town of Mad Oak ended at the boundary shrine a hundred yards ahead , and the sounds were coming from somewhere well beyond that , in the wilderness . The voices were human and male , but he had no idea what men would be doing out there . The old path to Willowbank ran through that general area , but no one used it anymore , not since the guide had retired . Even when the Willowbank Guide had been working , no one would have been thrashing about like that . The local ler , the spirits of that particular bit of forest , were not likely to appreciate such a disturbance . Ler that had made their accommodation with humanity would tolerate it , and a man could generally rattle about in town without worrying about angering the spirit of each branch he brushed aside , or each blade of grass he trod upon , but out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forgiving . Anyone venturing out there was likely to find thorns embedding themselves in his legs , branches lashing at his eyes , and the entire natural world in general trying to kill him . So who was making all that noise ? Sword looked down at the jug in his hand , and at his empty belt . If he had been wearing his sword he might have decided to investigate , but he had just been going up to Brewer 's storeroom under the pavilion to fetch a gallon of beer . He had n't seen any reason to go armed . He had his silver talisman in his pocket , as he always did , but had not his sword , nor any ara feathers to ward off hostile magic ; he could almost certainly survive a little jaunt into the wilderness , but it might be unpleasant . " What 's happening ? " someone asked from behind him . " Sword , do you know ? " " No , " Sword replied . " I do n't think it 's anything to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen townsfolk had heard the commotion as he had , and had emerged from their homes to peer into the underbrush beyond the boundary , trying to make out what was going on . " They 're coming closer . " Sword knew the woman who said that as Curly . " Yes , they are , " he agreed . He realized that the others were all watching him expectantly , and he sighed . He knew that they thought that exploring this phenomenon was somehow his responsibility . Being one of the Chosen , the eight magical defenders of Barokan , was not supposed to mean that he had to check out every potentially dangerous oddity that might happen along , but convincing his fellow townsfolk of that seemed to be impossible . They seemed to feel that if they had a hero living among them , they were entitled to see heroics . " I 'll get my sword , " he said . He resisted the temptation to say anything about the beer ; after all , he could fetch that any time . He turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared with his mother and younger sisters , where he set the still-empty jug on the kitchen table and fetched his sword belt from the peg by the door . He buckled it in place , making sure the blade was loose in its sheath , then hurried back out , through the village square and along the path below the pavilion . A score of the townsfolk had gathered at the boundary stone and were staring out into the forest , though none set so much as a toe beyond the marker . Much rustling , thumping , and unintelligible conversation could still be heard out in the wild . Whatever was making the noise seemed to have come a little closer . As Sword neared the group one of his childhood friends , a big fellow called Brokenose , said , " They 've been calling , but we have n't answered . We were waiting for you . " " Thank you , " Sword said sourly , and not at all sincerely . He remembered why he and Brokenose did n't spend much time together anymore as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain he glimpsed movement , though he was not sure what he was seeing . " Has anyone told Priest or the priestesses ? " " Younger Priestess is fetching Elder Priestess from the northern fields , " said a man called Flute . " Priest is still ill . " " Ill " was a euphemism . Old Priest was dying , and everyone in Mad Oak knew it , though not all were willing to admit it . " I know he 's ill , " Sword said . " He should still be told . " " Wo n't the ler tell him ? " Curly asked . " Maybe , " Sword acknowledged . " Ho , the village ! " came a distant cry . " Ca n't you hear us ? " Several people turned expectant faces toward Sword , who raised his hands to either side of his mouth . " We hear you ! " he shouted back . " Who are you ? " There was a mutter of what might have been cheering , and then a voice called , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggered a round of murmuring , and Sword sighed again . " Are you sure we should let them get here ? " Curly asked . " I 'll go see who they are , " Sword said , and with a hand on his sword hilt he marched down the slope . He paused at the boundary shrine , knelt briefly , and said , " I thank you , spirits of my homeland , and pray that I may return safely to your protection . " Then he rose and stepped past , into the wilderness . He could feel the change instantly as he left behind the familiar , accepting ler of his village and stepped into the territory of the wild ler that dwelt outside human bounds . The air seemed suddenly hot and hostile , rather than warm and comforting . The gentle breeze turned harsh . Weeds tore at his trousers . Most people in Mad Oak would never have dared to set foot beyond the shrine without a guide and the protection of ara feathers , but Sword , as one of the Chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harass him , but were unlikely to do him any serious harm . Except for the bloodthirsty Mad Oak itself , up on the ridgetop to the southwest , he did not think anything near the village posed a real threat to him , and even that terrible old tree had failed to lure him in the one time he had gotten close to it . Putting his hand on the hilt of his sword had been enough to alert the ler that protected him and break the oak 's spell . He kept a hand on his sword 's hilt , just in case , as he marched boldly down into the birch grove . He did not have to go far ; as soon as he passed the first line of undergrowth that bordered the grove he could see the strangers , fifty yards away among the birches . There were at least a dozen of them , all big men in matching attire . They wore broad-brimmed , cloth-covered helmets crowned with ara feathers , and despite the heat they were clad in thick quilted jackets and leggings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed signs of hard use , with hundreds of little slashes and tears , patches of mud and smears of green , thorns and briars everywhere . The feathers were crumpled and broken in many places . Clearly , these men were not appeasing the wild ler , nor dodging them , as a guide might , but were simply bulling their way through , relying on their strange clothing to protect them from lashing branches , stabbing thorns , and the claws and teeth of small animals . Heavy leather gloves held sticks and shovels and machetes , and the men were hacking and digging their way through the undergrowth . The damage to their protective clothing made it clear that the undergrowth and its ler had not yielded without a fight . Sword had never seen anything like this before , nor heard of such a thing . The people of Barokan had always respected ler , always tried to cooperate with the spirits of the land and sky and forest . Every town and village had made accommodations with its own ler , usually through a priesthood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities had been left alone . Until now . These men were clearly not leaving the wilderness alone . Sword kept walking into the birch grove , watching the men intently . He did n't recognize any of them . None were from Mad Oak , nor were any of them guides he knew . This whole scene was unspeakably bizarre . Whole gangs of men simply did not venture into the wilderness like this , and ordinarily nobody would tear up the natural landscape in such a brutal fashion , so utterly heedless of the ler . The normal thing to do would be to either try to slip through without disturbing the ler , or to appease them as best one could , but these men appeared to be deliberately antagonizing the wilderness spirits . " Who are you ? " Sword demanded , as soon as the strangers noticed his approach . The slashing , chopping , and shoveling stopped as the entire party turned to look at him . " The Wizard Lord 's road crew , " one of them called back . " Who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm called Sword , " Sword replied . " What do you mean , road crew ? " " Sword ? The Swordsman ? Really ? " Several voices spoke at once , as the entire party lowered their tools and turned to stare . " The Swordsman , yes . " Sword drew his weapon and let it hang loosely in his hand . " Now , who are you people , and what are you doing here ? " " He told you , we 're a road crew , " a man called . He reached up and doffed his helmet , revealing sweat-matted hair and a long , half-healed slash across his forehead that seemed to indicate that at least one ler had put up resistance . " We 're cutting a road through from Willowbank to Mad Oak . " Sword blinked and lowered his blade further . " Cutting a road ? " " That 's right . You do n't have a guide for this route anymore , so we 're cutting a road , and if it 's properly maintained you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment with this concept . He knew that in the Midlands the towns were often so close together that they were connected by broad roads , wide enough for two carts to pass , where no guide was needed to protect travelers from the untamed ler of the wilderness ; he had been there , and seen it for himself . But that was in the Midlands , where one town was only rarely separated from the next by more than a mile , and where the land between was as likely to be open grassland as forest . There were no open roads in Longvale , where a good ten miles of thick woods and marshland divided Mad Oak from Willowbank ; there were only narrow , winding paths that required a skilled guide to navigate safely . Or rather , there had been only narrow , dangerous paths until now . Looking past the self-proclaimed " road crew , " Sword could see that they had indeed cut a broad , straight path through the forest-a strip of bare , sun-dappled brown earth stretching away as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lining either side . He could smell the rich scent of fresh soil , an odor he associated with fields , rather than forests . Bits of leaf fluttered about those side mounds in ways that had nothing to do with the faint breeze that found its way through the birches , and little glimmers of light and color moved through them where no sunlight could reach ; the ler of the plants and other things that had been cleared away were obviously still active , and struggling to respond to the disruption of their home . The road itself , though , seemed clear and untroubled . Sword pointed at it . " That goes all the way to Willowbank ? " " Indeed it does , " said the man who had first told him he faced a road crew , glancing proudly back over his shoulder . " Oh , it 's not all as straight as that , as we had to route it around the bogs , but it 's a good road . And before that we cut a road from Rock Bridge to Willowbank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did ? " " We did . And if the other crews have done their jobs , you can now walk from here all the way to Winterhome without a guide , so long as you stay on the road and wear a few feathers . " That was more than Sword could comprehend all at once . " Winterhome ? " " Winterhome . That 's where the Wizard Lord lives , after all . " Sword nodded . " Of course , " he agreed . He had heard that the current Wizard Lord had chosen Winterhome as his home . He had vaguely wondered why , since he knew the Wizard Lord was not a native of Winterhome , but he had not pursued the matter . After all , a Wizard Lord could live anywhere in Barokan that he chose ; if the current one wanted to live at the foot of the Eastern Cliffs , in the town where the Uplanders wintered , that was his business , and none of Sword 's concern . But Winterhome had to be a hundred miles away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through all that wilderness ? He stared at the road . After a moment 's awkward silence , the apparent crew chief turned and called , " All right , now , we have work to do ! We want this cut through to Mad Oak while it 's still light-with luck we 'll dance with the girls in the town 's pavilion tonight ! " A murmur of agreement sounded . The men lifted their tools and resumed hacking at the underbrush , extending their road through the birch grove . Sword shifted his gaze from the road vanishing into the forest to the hands swinging machetes and hoes . He stared for a moment , then turned without another word and headed back to town . This was all strange and new , and he had no idea how to react to it , but it did not seem to call for hostility . The road crew was not breaking any laws , so far as he knew . It was not customary to disturb all those wild ler , but there was no formal stricture forbidding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrine , and did nothing to upset the town 's own ler , there was no obvious reason to interfere . Besides , Sword had no real authority in Mad Oak ; he was n't a priest . He would go back and let the rest of the town decide what to do . As he neared the boundary he could see a score of his townsfolk waiting for him just beyond the shrine-not just those who had been there before , but more . Elder and Younger Priestess had joined the party , and looked unhappy ; the sigils of office on their foreheads seemed to be pulsing and glowing red , rather than their usual pale and steady gold . Sword waved to them to indicate that all was well , but he was not actually sure that was true . " What 's happening ? " Younger Priestess called . " The ler are upset ! " " They 're building a road , " Sword called back . " All the way to . . . to Willowbank . " The priestesses exchanged glances ; then Elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building a road , " Sword repeated , though he was close enough to the border now that he no longer needed to shout . " They 're clearing a path through the wilderness , so we wo n't need guides anymore . " " Can they do that ? What about all the ler ? " Younger Priestess asked . Her hand reached up to rub at her forehead . Sword shrugged . " The men do n't appear to be having any real problems . A few cuts and scratches . They 're wearing protective clothing and carrying ara feathers . " " They are disturbing the ler , though , " Elder said . " Many , many ler . We can hear them . " " And feel them , " Younger added . Sword glanced over his shoulder at the flashing machetes and thumping shovels . " They do n't seem to care . " " Well , they do n't need to live here ! " Younger exclaimed . " Those are our ler . . . " " No , " Elder said thoughtfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sword . " They 'll stop at the border ? " " I assume so . One of them said something about dancing in our pavilion tonight . I do n't think they mean us any harm , nor anything in Mad Oak . " " They 're disrupting many spirits , though-earth and leaf and tree . And those wo n't just quietly vanish . " The light and movement in those mounds alongside the road had told Sword as much . " What will they do ? " he asked , genuinely curious . " I 've never heard of anything like this . " The priestess frowned . " Well , they 'll dissipate eventually-a ler like that without a home , without a solid object to bind it to our world , fades away in time . " " Not all ler are tied to objects , though , " Sword protested , looking down at the sword in his hand . " The ler of the land are , " Elder said . " Any ler a priest can deal with is . The so-called higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wizards , not priests , and I doubt they 're being disturbed by this . These men are n't defying wind or fire or strength or warmth or any of those , they 're uprooting branch and stalk , and turning earth . " " So the disturbed ler will dissipate . . . " " Eventually . But until then they 'll strike out in any way they can . They 'll form into misshapen ghosts to strike at their attackers , they 'll look for things they can possess , new homes they can claim . " " But the men are protected , " Sword said . " They 're wearing ara feathers , and good sturdy clothes . " " Then they may be safe enough , but I wo n't walk that road they 're building any time soon . And I think we may want to keep a close watch on the livestock and the children for the next few days , and be wary of bad dreams . " She looked Sword in the eye . " Did they say who began this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in this way ? " " The Wizard Lord , " Sword said . " The Lord of Winterhome . " " Ah , " Elder said . For a moment no one spoke ; then she added , " Do you think you may need to kill him ? " The question was not as bizarre as it might seem , and Sword took it very seriously . The Wizard Lord was selected by the other wizards of Barokan , the so-called Council of Immortals , to rule over all the land from the Eastern Cliffs to the Western Isles , and was given great magical power to do so . The Wizard Lord controlled the weather , and had power over wind and fire , over disease , and over many of the beasts of the wilderness . He was empowered to serve as judge and executioner of any wizard who misbehaved , and any criminal who fled from the towns into the wild . And as a check on the dangers of such great power , eight ordinary people were chosen to take up special roles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the duty of these eight to remove any Wizard Lord who proved himself unfit for his high office . Sword , the Swordsman , was one of the Chosen . The silver talisman he always carried in his pocket bound him to the ler of muscle and steel and ensured that he was the world 's greatest swordsman , unbeatable in single combat . In the past , when Wizard Lords had gone bad , it was usually the Swordsmen of the time who eventually slew them . This particular Swordsman had thought the job was ceremonial when he first accepted it , as more than a century had passed without any known misbehavior by a Wizard Lord , but that long streak of good fortune had already been broken once . Several years ago Sword had struck down the Dark Lord of the Galbek Hills with a single blow to the heart . But that Wizard Lord had slaughtered a village ; this one was merely building roads . How could building roads be a crime punishable by death ? Yes , it disturbed the natural order , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord had not gone mad , and was not harming anyone , nor trying to exceed the powers allotted him , then he was not a Dark Lord and did not need to be removed . The Chosen were not responsible for maintaining order , but only for ridding Barokan of Dark Lords . Elder was waiting for a reply . " I hope not , " Sword said . " I very much hope not . "
