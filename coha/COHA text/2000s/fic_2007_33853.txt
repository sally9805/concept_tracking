History of the Clans Many moons ago , the forest was a wilderness , untamed by territories . In the north lay sweeping moorland ; in the south was dense woodland . On the edge of the trees , a tumbling river flowed out of a dark ravine . Cats came into the forest . They were drawn by the soft rustlings of small creatures , shadows under the water , and the sudden commotion of birds ' wings in the trees . These were not warrior cats . They lived in small groups , not yet Clans . There were no borders set down . And they fought constantly , fearful that prey might run out and that their overlapping territories were being threatened . It was a lawless , bloody time for the forest , and many cats died . One night , when the moon was full , the cats agreed to meet at a clearing in the forest surrounded by four great oak trees . They argued over stolen prey . Claws flashed ; challenging yowls rang across the forest . A terrible battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . Many cats died that night . Exhausted by their wounds , the survivors slept where they had fought . When they woke they were bathed in moonlight . All around them they saw the spirits of their slain kin , no longer torn and bloodied but shining like fallen stars . They huddled on the ground , and , as the spirits spoke , they saw terrible visionsof the future . They saw the forest drowned in blood , their kits stalked by death at every pawstep . And they knew that the fighting had to end . " Unite or die , " said the spirits . From among the living cats , a black female was the first to speak . She rose from the ground on stiff , battle-wearied legs . " My name is Shadow , " she mewed . " How should we unite , unless we have a leader ? I can hunt in the depths of the darkest night . Let Shadow rule the forest ! " " And you would lead us into darkness too ! " meowed a silvery gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I move through the forest along secret paths and hidden places . It is River , not Shadow , who should unite the forest ! " " The forest is more than River and Shadow , " growled a wiry brown female . " Wind alone reaches its distant corners . I am as fast as the wind that blows from the high moors . I should be the ruler . " The largest surviving cat was called Thunder . He was a fiery orange tom with amber eyes and large white paws . " What good is any of that compared to my strength and skill at hunting ? If any cat was born to rule , it is I. " A furious yowling broke out under the four great oaks , watched in silence by the spirit-cats . Dark clouds suddenly blew across the moon , and the living cats trembled in fear . On the top of a high rock , they saw a tabby cat , one of the fallen , her fur shining though there was no light in the sky . Her eyes flashed angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all as foolish as ducks ! " she meowed . " Ca n't you think beyond yourselves for one moment ? Think of your kits ! " The four cats-Shadow , River , Wind , and Thunder-looked up at the tabby , but none of them spoke . " The forest is big enough to feed all your families and many more , " she meowed . " You must find other cats like you , choose a home in the forest , and set down borders . " At that moment , the moon broke free of the clouds , revealing a circle of starlit spirit-cats around the edge of the clearing . A white tom stepped forward . " If you do this , " he meowed , " we will reward you with eight more lives , so that you may lead your Clans for many moons to come . " Next to speak was a slender tortoiseshell . She stepped forward and stood beside the white tom . " We will watch over you from Silverpelt , " she promised , and lifted her eyes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We will visit you in your dreams and guide you on your journeys . " " Once a month , " meowed the white tom , " at the full moon , you will gather together here , between the four great oak trees , for a night of truce . You will see us above you in Silverpelt and know we are watching . And if blood is spilled on those nights , you will know we are angry . " " You will be warriors ! " yowled the tabby from the high rock . Thunder , River , Wind , and Shadow bowed their heads . " From now on , you will live by a warrior code . Your hearts will be filled with courage and nobility , and if you must fight , it will be not for greed , but for honor and justice . " There was a long silence . Finally Thunder nodded his broad orange head . " This is wise advice . I believe we can choose our territories and lay down borders fairly , in peace . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they returned to their homes and sought out cats like themselves , with similar strengths and abilities . River found cats willing to fish for their prey . Shadow gathered nighttime hunters with clever minds and sharp claws . Thunder found hunters who could track prey through the thickest undergrowth . To Wind came the fastest runners and cats who loved the open moors . Then they divided the forest so each Clan had enough prey to survive , and all the cats could live in safety . And when the leaders returned to the four great oaks for the first night of the full-moon truce , their starry ancestors gave them eight more lives , as they had promised . There was not always peace between the Clans , but that was to be expected-cats are born with claws and teeth for a reason . Still , as long as they lived by the warrior code , their fallen ancestors would watch over them and guide them through their lives . And so the age of the warrior Clans began .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
