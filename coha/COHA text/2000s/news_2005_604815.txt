<p> At first , Todd Andrews assumed the dull pain in his left forearm came from too much basketball . So he could hardly believe it when doctors told him he had osteosarcoma , a type of bone cancer , and would need surgery and chemotherapy . <p> But Andrews , an account manager at Karwoski &; Courage Public Relations in Minneapolis , was n't going to let treatment interfere with work . He had a permanent catheter inserted into his chest in order to take chemotherapy . Andrews came to the office every day with his chemotherapy bag slung over his shoulder . Then he would set the bag up at his desk . He worked with it beside him , listening to the soft zoom of the pump as it delivered chemicals through tubes under his shirt . <p> Cancer is no longer the death sentence it used to be , and longer survival rates and better ways to manage the side effects of treatment mean more people like Andrews are staying in the workforce during treatment . That 's creating challenges for employers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt better when I was up and moving , and my co-workers are also my friends , " says Andrews , 28 , who is now continuing treatment for the cancer that has recently spread to his lungs . " Work has said to take whatever time I need . They care about me as a person . " <p> About 40% of the more than 1 million Americans diagnosed with some form of cancer each year are working-age adults , and nearly 10 million people in the USA are cancer survivors . High-profile Americans with cancer are continuing to work . Before his death this year , Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist underwent treatment for thyroid cancer and returned to the bench . Sen. John Kerry , D-Mass. , had surgery for prostate cancer in 2003 and continued his campaign for the presidency . FBI Director Robert Mueller also had prostate cancer surgery . <p> The federal government is also focusing attention on the issue . The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) this year issued a publication explaining how and when federal anti-discrimination law protects employees with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconception about the work abilities of employees with the disease . <p> " We were frustrated , " says Joyce Walker-Jones , a senior attorney at the EEOC . " We wanted employers to look at this more as a chronic health issue . People are working more with cancer than they were 10 or 20 years ago . These are the hidden disabilities employers will have to deal with as employees get older . " <p> Employers will also grapple with how to accommodate employees with cancer as baby boomers continue to work rather than retiring . If cancer rates follow current patterns , the number of people diagnosed with cancer will double from 1.3 million in 2000 to 2.6 million in 2050 , according to a report by the National Cancer Institute and other health organizations . <p> That means there will be more people like Arnold Gold . At 87 he is battling liver cancer , and every three weeks he drives 20 minutes to his hospital for chemotherapy . But Gold , who is semiretired , continues to work as an independent contractor in the kitchen cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design installations . <p> The side effects from his chemotherapy , such as fatigue and tingling and numbness in his fingers , at times can be bothersome when he 's working . He says he 's been upfront with clients about the diagnosis . <p> " I know some people do n't talk about it , but I do n't have fear . I tell them I have cancer in the liver , " says Gold , of Pikesville , Md . " It does n't affect my business . " <p> Challenges at work <p> But lawyers and legal experts such as Walker-Jones say cancer can also have a negative impact on employment : Job hunters with cancer may wonder when , or whether , they should tell prospective employers . People who run their own businesses often ca n't stop working because then they could n't afford health insurance . And employees may see promotion opportunities vanish because employers view them as unable to do more work . <p> Frank Micle , 55 , is president of his own firm , Industrial Illustrators , in Irwin , Pa. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lung cancer in 2002 after he started coughing up blood . But he had to keep working , downing codeine to try to stop coughing before meeting with customers . <p> " I got sicker and sicker , and I 'm trying to run a business , " says Micle , who feels better today under a new treatment . He gets chemotherapy in Tulsa every month at Cancer Treatment Centers of America , but he is able to keep working by setting up a laptop , a printer and a stapler in his room . <p> " I 've got lung cancer , " he says , " but I 've got a business to run . " <p> Since fiscal year 1992 , the federal government 's EEOC has received more than 5,000 complaints from employees who believe they 've been discriminated against because of cancer . In July 2005 , the agency settled a lawsuit for $100,000 with Kindred Pharmacy Services in New Berlin , Wis . The EEOC says a manager was fired after trying to return to work following medical leave for cancer surgery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pharmacy is committed to equal opportunity principles and prohibits unlawful discrimination . They also said they reached the agreement because it was in the best interests of the parties . <p> " People with cancer may still be seen as having a death sentence . They do n't get promoted because ( employers ) are afraid they wo n't be there . There 's terrible anxiety about how others will react , " says Elizabeth Clark , executive director of the National Association of Social Workers in Washington . <p> Clark says one woman with breast cancer returned from medical leave to discover co-workers had cannibalized her desk , taking her supplies and claiming her space . <p> But co-workers can be a vital source of support . Beverly Hill , 49 , a labor-and-delivery nurse at Boca Raton Community Hospital in Boca Raton , Fla. , was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003 and underwent surgery , chemotherapy and radiation . She continued to work full time and tried to keep her diagnosis quiet , but word got out . <p> One day , a nurse called her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread over the bed . As a surprise , her co-workers had each taken a square of fabric , decorated it in her honor , and sewn them all together . <p> " I was so pleased and thrilled , " says Hill , of Deerfield Beach , Fla . " I kept it hanging in my room . It was such a message of hope , " she says , adding that she could n't have made it through work without the help of her co-workers . <p> In May 2005 , Hill began having dizzy spells and discovered she had a brain tumor . After surgery and radiation , she returned to work , starting back unsteadily at first with a walker , then with a cane . The experience , she says , has shown her that her co-workers are family . She says it 's also changed her own perspective on her job . <p> " I feel like I 'm a lot more empathetic with my patients , " she says . <p> Accommodating patients <p> Many companies make accommodations for employees who have cancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take time off with full or partial pay . For example , under a short-term disability program , employees may get 60% of their regular pay for 13 to 26 weeks . <p> *Employees can take time off for medical treatments under the Family and Medical Leave Act : The federal law provides for up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off in a year , and that time can be taken in short increments . <p> " Employees watch how companies handle it , because they know it can happen to them , " says Carolyn Messner , director of education and training with CancerCare , a non-profit support organization in New York . " It sends a message . " <p> Employers also are adopting more prevention and disease-management programs to combat cancer , and they 're providing employee assistance or mental-health services that can assist employees who have a cancer diagnosis . <p> At HomeBanc there are formal benefits , such as health insurance , to help employees with cancer . There is also informal assistance . About 60% of the staff of 1,300 are loan officers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , co-workers have taken over closing the loans or added some of their own loans to their ailing colleague 's pipeline to ensure their colleague gets the same level of pay . Flexible hours let employees leave as needed for treatments . And the company has contracted through Corporate Chaplains of America for chaplains . <p> There is also an associate emergency fund , supported by voluntary payroll deductions , that has gone to employees with cancer . <p> " We want you to get better . Your job is going to be here , and we 're going to work through this with you , " says Dwight " Ike " Reighard , chief people officer at HomeBanc . " This could happen to any one of us . " <p> Other companies have continued to support their workers ' careers , even in the face of cancer . When Bill Seman , 63 , was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , he initially thought about retiring and had a retirement plan drawn up that he kept in his desk . Instead , he underwent chemotherapy and radiation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plant manager . <p> " Coming to work , you feel like you still count for something . The group here , they did n't treat me any differently , " Seman says . " Xerox as a company did n't treat me any differently . "
