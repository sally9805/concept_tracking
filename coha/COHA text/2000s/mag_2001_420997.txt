With tips from a master baker and Headnote fresh ingredients from the garden , you can make rustic , artisan-style bread at home Photograph A round of Garden Tomato Bread and a batard of Leek and Walnut . Photograph Lou Preston // Mornings often find Lou Preston , owner and winemaker of Preston Vineyards near Healdsburg , California , mixing bread dough , not cuvees , and deftly loading his brick oven with dozens of uniform loaves . Heavy wood farmhouse tables cohabit amicably with gleaming stainless steel equipment in the winery 's commercial bakery , an arrangement echoed by the way Preston keeps track of the recipes for his artisan breads-on a floury Palm Pilot in his pocket . Much of what grows on the winery grounds-vegetables , herbs , olives , even the grapes themselves-finds its way into Preston 's crusty loaves . It makes sense that a passion for baking bread would coincide with a passion for making wine . Both depend on warm weather to ripen the harvest that imbues them with the character of the place where they were made ; both develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for both , a successful blend of flavors depends on no one element overwhelming the rest . Combinations like leek and walnut and tomato and herb inspired us to adapt Preston 's recipes and techniques for the home kitchen . We offer them here , along with tips and shortcuts , in the cause of making artisans of us all .

Sidebar TERMS AND TIPS Artisan steps Sidebar BIGA : A yeast-based starter for which a portion of the dough is mixed first and allowed to ferment , giving the finished loaf some of the characteristics of bread made with a sourdough starter . Shortcut : Without the biga , our recipes still produce great loaves . In the basic recipe , just increase the yeast by 1 1/4 teaspoons , the bread flour by 1 1/2 cups , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many variables that affect the dough 's consistency , the amounts of flour we call for are somewhat approximate . The dough should be soft , malleable , and slightly sticky . If the mixer is laboring or the dough feels stiff , add water , 1 tablespoon at a time , and continue kneading until it 's soft and elastic . If dough sticks to the sides of the bowl or is too sticky to knead by hand , add more flour , 2 tablespoons at a time , until it pulls cleanly from the sides or feels only slightly sticky . SLOW RISE : When bread rises slowly at a cool temperature , it develops more flavor than when it rises quickly in a warm place . Sidebar PROOFING : Once the loaves are shaped , they need to rise again before they are baked . To tell whether they 've proofed long enough , press one gently ; your finger should leave a distinct imprint that fills in slowly . Underproofed loaves feel tight and spring back quickly ; overproofed loaves feel flabby and offer little resistance when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaf a place to grow during its last burst of expansion in the oven . BAKING STONE : A stone distributes the heat more evenly Sidebar and makes a crisper crust . At least 30 minutes before baking , set the stone on a rack in the lower third of the oven and heat oven to 450 deg . STEAM : Prevents the crust from forming before loaf has fully expanded and contributes to the find thick , hard crust . You can create steam in your oven by using a spray bottle filled with clean water . // <p>
