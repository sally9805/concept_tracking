CORRECTION : Published March 2004 page 12 : CORRECTION : In " The Tragedy of Tillamook Bay , " the description of Ed Loll , one of the 11 people who died , was incorrect . Loll was in good health before the accident . He suffered from neither hip nor heart problems . We regret the error .  --  THE EDITORS Sharon Davis had a stomachache that morning . She 'd felt queasy for days , actually , so when her husband , Doug , got up as usual at 4:30 , he packed his own lunch : two turkey sandwiches , a cookie , and a soda . Then he came back into the bedroom and gave his wife a quick hug . They 'd been married 45 years . " If you 're still sick this afternoon , honey , " he said , " I think I 'll take you to the doctor . " Doug Davis threw on his green wind-breaker and drove down into the center of Garibaldi , Oregon , toward Tillamook Bay , whose brackish waters drain , a little over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skies were overcast that June morning and the winds , blowing south at three knots , were fairly gentle . Davis , a 66-year-old sea captain , was eager to get out onto the water ; semiretired now , he had been out only once all season . So when he stepped into the office of Garibaldi Charters , he was a chipper employee . " If anyone has a bet going on who 'll catch the first fish , " he often said to clients in such moments , " I can be bribed . I 'll cut your friend 's line , for a price . " The humor  --  jabbing but gentle  --  was pure Garibaldi . With a population of 1,000 scattered in modest homes on a hill overlooking the bay , Garibaldi is a bona fide fishing village  --  a place where the bars are rife with thick-bellied guys , unshaven and walleyed after three days at sea . It 's also a tourist town , the nearest port to landlocked Portland , 70 miles east , and home to five charter-boat companies . Thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks want a captain who 's a bit of a salty dog but not a raving , peg-legged Ahab Davis was perfect . A longtime store manager for F.W. Woolworth , he 'd skippered boats for Garibaldi Charters for the past 17 years . He 'd navigated the Northwest 's most treacherous waters , at the mouth of the Columbia River , scores of times without incident . His fellow captain Tron Buell fondly recalls , " Doug could n't catch fish worth a damn , but he knew where to find them . " Still , it may be that his primary skills were interpersonal . Here was a sea captain who moonlighted as a real estate agent and managed somehow to sell homes to the passengers on his 35-foot boat , a well-maintained fiberglass inboard called the Taki-Tooo Davis charmed them , always , with that warm , gibey wit , and he did his best gags in tandem with his favorite deckhand , Chuck Allen , a 71-year-old South Carolina native But Allen felt sick that morning , too . At the dock he told Davis , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fishing tackle , " and he even made vain attempts to convince one paying customer to stay ashore . " It 's rough out there , " he said It was . Outside the harbor , a fast ebbing tide  --  one of the year 's lowest  --  was confronting waves that were inexplicably high , rising to 15 feet as they rolled toward the beach . These waves stacked up against the tide , and this made them exceedingly steep . Davis ' colleague , Capt . Joe Ockenfels , would not even start his engine that day But there were 17 passengers signed up to ride the Taki-Tooo , and at least one of them , Ed Loll , had a bet going . Sixty-six years old , from Cedar Rapids , Iowa , Loll had never once been out on saltwater . But as the Taki-Tooo idled in the harbor , he elbowed his son Brian , a 34-year-old surveyor who weighs an imposing 300 pounds , and he spoke with mock gravity , into cupped hands . " I need everybody 's attention , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigger fish than my son . " Davis gave a quick safety lecture , telling the passengers he 'd let them know if they needed a life jacket , and then the Taki-Tooo went out toward the sea THE DEADLY BAR At the edge of nearly any ocean harbor , there is a bar where fresh-water meets saltwater and the waves chop against an ocean floor made shallow by the piles of dirt and sand kicked seaward by the freshwater . The danger zone outside Garibaldi 's harbor is called the Tillamook Bar . It 's small as bars go , covering about a square mile , and it affords sea pilots little room to maneuver against the turbulent waters that surge out of the bay , through a relatively narrow , quarter-mile-wide channel formed by two long , slim jetties The Tillamook Bar has claimed more than 200 lives in recorded history . It was most dangerous before the 1920S , when the adjacent channel was first dredged , but a recent trend , perhaps spurred by global warming , has wrought a new threat . " The winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast , " says Paul Komar , professor emeritus of oceanography at Oregon State University . " It 's extending into June , and the waves are getting bigger and bigger . " The largest winter waves were 33 feet high a quarter century ago . Now they can reach 39 feet . They 've been known to sweep up onto the north jetty of Tillamook Bay , onto the road there , and throw cars off the ground . Last year , a particularly bad wave pinned a woman under a truck , putting her into a coma for weeks Doug Davis first saw the big swells when the Taki-Tooo cut into the slot between the jetties . There is a 40-foot-high Coast Guard tower on the north jetty , topped by an orange sign reading ROUGH BAR . Deck-hand Tamara Buell  --  the sister of Tron Buell , and Chuck Allen 's 22-year-old replacement on the Taki-Tooo that morning  --  did n't set the fishing rods out on the deck , as she usually would have . She waited Meanwhile , passenger Mark Hamlett , 52 , tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor and a competitive bass fisherman , Hamlett was the leader of an angling party that included his two grown sons ; his son-in-law , Brian Loll ; and Brian 's dad , Ed . " When we got to the docks that morning , " Hamlett recalls , " my first thought was , " That boat 's awful small . ' " Hamlett considered calling off the trip , but he did n't . He knew that 3 or 4 miles off the Oregon coast , 100 feet down , the reefs are rife with fish every spring : 5-pound black sea bass , seatrout , ling cod , canary rockfish , and yelloweye . " I went against my better judgment , " Hamlett says . " Ed really wanted to go out . " As the boat cruised to sea , Hamlett stood on deck telling Doug Davis how , on a recent fishing trip , he 'd caught five sturgeon that were " 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 feet long . " Davis did n't say much . He was concentrating : squinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the Taki-Tooo inside the slot , deliberating for nearly an hour . Three charter boats crossed successfully . When one of the captains , Tron Buell , reached the open ocean , he radioed back , " That was hardly worth it . Do n't tell my mom . " Davis laughed , but he knew enough to hold a certain awe of the ocean . " Doug and I had a running joke , " remembers another Garibaldi boat captain , Jim Weisberg . " We 'd sit out there by the jetty and we 'd say , Who 's gon na turn around first , you or me ? ' Over the years , we probably turned back 50 or 60 times . " GOING DOWN Davis hit the throttle and went outside the jetty , onto the bar . Then the big waves came on . There were two 10-footers , Hamlett recalls , and at the top of the next one , Davis paused and shifted into reverse , possibly to avoid slamming into one of the two logs bobbing loose by the north jetty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , and the next wave was the biggest yet  --  perhaps 25 feet high . Tron Buell had encountered monsters like this while crossing the bar , too , and he 'd dodged them , skirting left or right toward their edges to avoid a deluge over the bow . Maybe Davis had this tactic in mind , or maybe , as Hamlett suggests , " He just panicked the way a driver on an icy hill hits the brakes . " Davis turned right , broadside to the wave " Right then , " Hamlett says , " I thought , My wife and daughter just lost their whole family . ' " He took cover below deck . Then the wave hit and the boat rolled . It turned one and a half times , and the six men down below slammed against the ceiling and walls . Igloo coolers ricocheted through the air , smacking heads , and all 13 people up on the deck , including the captain , were thrown , without life vests , into the 51-degree water of the Pacific Ocean Tamara Buell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of stopped down there , underwater , to look for the surface . I saw some light green and I swam up . " She was about 300 yards offshore . " I knew I was going to die , " she says , " but I thought about my family and everybody close to me and how sad it would be for them if I died . I just got pissed off and I swam toward the shore . " Meanwhile , down in the hull the water was 3 feet high and the light oddly tranquil . " It was like dusk in there , " remembers one passenger , Richard Forsman . " The windows were underwater . " The men were trapped by them , and by the closed hatch . Hamlett passed out life jackets . The men stood on the ceiling , now the floor , and wondered how they might crack the thick window . Would too much water gush in before they could escape ? And what would they use to shatter the window ? " Brian , " said Ed Loll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Loll was a big man . In his youth , he 'd been , like his son , a college football player , a lineman . He 'd taught Brian how to pass a football in the backyard back in Cedar Rapids and he 'd taught him how to fish in Minnesota . But now he had a new hip , and he 'd suffered two heart attacks . He was a retired computer programmer who drove a yellow school bus each morning , and yet he still tried to retain a certain alpha-like authority over his son . " On the way out to Garibaldi , " Brian remembers , " I said , I 'm paying for the fishing . This is a Father 's Day present . ' He was like , I 'm not going to let you pay . I 'm your father . I 'm here to support you . ' We argued all the way to the harbor . Then he paid . " Brian wanted to reciprocate on this visit  --  to pay his father back , to take care of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't even see his dad . He just kept calling his name : " Dad , are you okay ? " " I 'm fine , " Ed Loll said hoarsely Suddenly , the boat rolled again . A window broke , and the water went from Brian Loll 's waist to his neck within half a minute . " I feel like I should have been able to do something , " he says , " like get my dad to the window : push him out toward safety . I 'm a big guy . I 've been able to bully stuff around my whole life . " But in the deep water Brian lost contact with his dad , and a certain voice in his head , sent from God , he believes , told him , " Either you drown here in the boat , or you go out and fight in the ocean . " Loll took off his life jacket and held it over his head , and then he squeezed through the small window and swam up toward sunlight By now , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lifelong surfer , was safely making her way to shore . Most of the others who 'd been on the deck were far older . They were struggling now , presumably , and the 47-foot Coast Guard inflatable that had arrived within five minutes of the accident was not able to rescue a single person . The swimmers were too hard to spot and reach amid the heaving waves Brian Loll did n't have his life jacket  --  he 'd lost it , coming out the window  --  so now the waves broke on top of him . " I would get slammed down and churned around and then I 'd come up , gasping for air , " he remembers . He chopped at the water , using a crawl stroke he 'd learned decades before , but mostly he just rode the waves as they surged shoreward . Then , still about 200 feet out , thigh deep , he stood and began lumbering in until he collapsed in 6 inches of water . When someone finally helped him up and toward the warmth of an idling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand . " I knew my dad was wearing white tennis shoes , " he says . " I was looking for shoes like that on those bodies . " He did n't see them , and later , after seven of the Taki-Tooo 's survivors were rushed to the Tillamook County General Hospital , to receive treatment for mild hypothermia , a mood of terrified shock prevailed . " They were all physically okay , " says nurse Marta Cauble . " They were n't going to die , but they were traumatized and they repeatedly asked us , What 's going on ? ' They were asking and wondering who survived . " " I was scared , " Brian Loll remembers . " I kept asking everybody , Have you seen this guy Edward ? ' " Finally , around 8:20 , Mark Hamlett arrived . His two sons had swum to shore unharmed . Hamlett plowed his way into Brian Loll 's room and then told him the story . Recalling it now , he says , " Brian 's father and I were the last ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' All I heard was a moan that stopped midmoan . There was no gurgling , no fighting , no struggling . He just died on the boat . " " I broke down , " Brian says . " I cried . I felt like I had abandoned my dad . I 'm here and he 's not . " THE AFTERMATH In the end , 11 people died . It was the most devastating accident in U.S. waters since 1999 , and soon afterward the National Transportation Safety Board would take issue with Davis ' spare lecture at the docks . " No demonstration of donning a life jacket was given , " read the NTSB 's preliminary report , " and no passengers donned life jackets at that time . " The final report wo n't be released until next year , but bereaved families are unlikely to wait to place blame . At least three of them have enlisted Portland attorney Zig Zakovics to file " wrongful death " suits on their behalf . Zakovics anticipates that the families of the Taki-Tooo 's victims , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vie for a piece of the proceeds from Garibaldi Charters ' million-dollar insurance premium , as well as a piece of Capt . Davis ' estate and the assets of Garibaldi Charters But what lingers most now , in the wake of the capsizing , is a certain video clip that played often in Oregon last summer . The clip zeroed in on a Coast Guard helicopter hovering over the crashing surf and the wrecked Taki-Tooo , and then it followed a wet suit  --  clad rescue swimmer as he descended a cable amid all the clatter , went down underwater , and came up with bodies . One of the dead recovered in this manner wore a green windbreaker : Capt . Doug Davis " It 's a blessing that he did n't make it , " says Sharon Davis , " because if he had to live with what happened  --  10 passengers dying  --  he would 've been devastated . But still , I never expected that he would die on the ocean . We never had that discussion , and that morning he was just going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a normal day .
