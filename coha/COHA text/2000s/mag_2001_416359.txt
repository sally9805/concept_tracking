THE NEW STEEL I read with interest your article on zero waste ( " Can We Be Garbage-Free ? " March/April 2001 ) . I have worked with a number of individuals quoted in the article on bringing zero waste from a grass  --  roots movement to an accepted practice . Many of the companies I represent have been practicing efforts to become zero-waste firms for years . In particular , the U.S. Steel Group has eliminated so much waste that it has recently shut down a landfill that was only one-third full and turned it into a wetlands and educational center . I take exception to the photographic caption on page 31 : " America 's solution to its gigantic waste problem has been to landfill it , wasting valuable resources and creating a mountain of trash . " The photograph shows a pile of steel scrap ready to be processed by a shredder . It is not a pile of trash ! As a matter of fact , scrap is the steel industry 's most important raw material . Additionally , when looking at " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm surprised that Star-Kist 's new Flavor Fresh Pouch did not make this list . This new package , totally non  --  recyclable , is positioned to displace consumers ' purchasing habits away from canned tuna , which comes in a highly recyclable container that has an almost 60 percent recycling rate . Obviously , we in the steel industry are concerned with the loss of this product to a pouch , but more importantly , as a lifetime board member of the National Recycling Coalition , I am concerned about replacing any recyclable product with a non-recyclable product . Bill Heenan President , Steel Recycling Institute Pittsburgh , PA SHAVING OFF WASTE After reading your cover story on zero waste and the E packaging hall of shame , I want to commend Norelco for making its latest product packaging a little more environmentally friendly . Having recently purchased an electric razor , I was surprised to find that in place of the vacuum-molded plastic packaging insert , the company has switched to a 100 percent recyclable pulp-paper tray . The outer box is made of greyboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of this is that the company does not choose to trumpet this on the box as a P.R . plug . I was pretty impressed , and I thought someone should recognize whoever was behind the packaging change . Thanks , Norelco ! Robert Newell Detroit , MI Congratulations on an excellent article . It was superb , to say the least , and shows a very good understanding of the zero waste issues on E 's part . I would like to distribute some copies of the article to the Mayors of the Zero Waste Councils around New Zealand . Warren Snow Zero Waste New Zealand Auckland , New Zealand STAMPING TREES I just read your article " All Decked Out " ( House and Home , March/ April 2001 ) , and I would like to clear up an error . In the Dara raph describing options for selecting wood , you state , " ... and certified wood products , designated by a Certified Forest Products Council label . " The Certified Forest Products Council ( CFPC ) is an independent , nonprofit group dedicated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible forest-products buying in North America . We urge people and businesses to buy certified wood products , and we help businesses find certified suppliers and educate them on how to become certified . But we do not certify wood , and there is no CFPC label . There are a number of certification programs . To evaluate them , we have developed a set of criteria . A credible certification program must : Be international in scope ; Deal with issues of environmental performance , social responsibility and economic viability ; Provide for independent , third  --  party assessment of on-the-ground performance against endorsed standards ; Be developed through a transparent , democratic process involving a wide range of stakeholders . To date , only the certification program of the Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) meets CFPC 's criteria . We are continually reviewing developments and improvements in other programs . The FSC accredits several uou s to conduct audits and confer certification . Two U.S. groups that have received this accreditation are Scientific Certification Systems and SmartWood . A company can become certified either as landowner or chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tracked through the value chain , maintaining its identity through each step of the manufacturing and distribution process , and can be traced back to the forest from which it came ) . When a company becomes FSC-certified , it can mark the wood either with a stamp or a label . The rest of the statement is correct . If the product is marked or has an FSC label , it is " ... the only way you 'll know the wood comes from sustainably harvested forests . " Jean Sneed Certified Forest Products Council Beaverton , OR TOXIC TAMPONS AND NOXIOUS TOBACCO Regarding your article on tampons and sanitary napkins ( " Inner Sanctum , " Your Health , March/ April 2001 ) , I live near Perry , Florida , where P &G/Buckeye; operates a pulp mill producing cellulose for these products . You were misled into believing that the company does not use elemental chlorine at this mill . The company actually has two mills-in  --  one here : One uses chlorine dioxide , the other , elemental chlorine . The rayon and cellulose for tampons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elemental chlorine . Our community is a disaster because of toxic pollution . Joy Towles Ezell Salem , FL In the Your Health discussion of toxic feminine hygiene products , it was pointed out , according to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , no safe level for dioxin exposure exists . " It might also be pointed out that in the most recent EPA assessment of dioxin , it was determined that dioxin is 10 times worse than previously thought . The most interesting and troubling aspect of this is that even now , in the middle of a huge international outcry about the negative health effects of cigarettes , the EPA , the Department of Health and Human Services , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the Department of Agriculture , the National Cancer Institute and every government agency with oversight and regulatory powers continue to permit high levels of dioxin , without notice to consumers , in typical ( non-organic ) cigarettes . The EPA expresses concern about Environmental Tobacco Smoke but ignores its own information about the dioxin in that smoke . Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent that dioxin be removed from smoking products . Inhalation of incinerated dioxins is considered to be more than a thousand times greater of a health risk than even the exposure through feminine hygiene products or any other route , yet it is still legal . Dioxins in typical cigarettes come from the many chlorinated pesticide residues , the chlorine  --  bleached paper , any number of the hundreds of non-tobacco additives and the industrial waste cellulose that , according to U.S. patents , may constitute all or part of the stuffing in these concoctions . Comparisons of negative health effects of these processed cigarettes and those of dioxin exposures elsewhere turn up an almost identical list of pathologies . The EPA is compelled to address dioxin because the issue is impossible to hide , but the EPA et al. , in deference to cigarette makers , cigarette ingredient suppliers , chlorine/dioxin industries , pesticide manufacturers , all of their insurers and investors and the complicit campaign-funded legislators , choose to blame " smoking " diseases on anything but pesticides , chlorine and dioxin . The victims were not protected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpatented tobacco plant is yet unstudied for its potentially negative effects . If one wishes to hit dioxin in its Achilles ' Heel for the sake of those human beings and wildlife exposed to all products and processes , there is no better way than through what even the government says is the worst health threat area : typical multi-ingredient cigarettes .
