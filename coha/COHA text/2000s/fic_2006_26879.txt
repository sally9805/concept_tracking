Sir Horace 's Helmet It all began when I was in my Thursday bedroom doing my ghost practice . I have always done regular ghost practice , as I was sure it would be much easier to find a ghost if the ghost thought that I was one too . I have always wanted to find a ghost , but you know , even though our house is called Spookie House , I have never , ever seen a single ghost , not even a very small one . I thought that Aunt Tabby had scared them off  --  she would scare me off if I were a ghost . Anyway , I was busy doing my practice and I had my ghost sheet over my head , which is why I tripped over Sir Horace 's left foot . Stupid thing . And then his left foot fell off , and Sir Horace collapsed into hundreds of pieces . Stupid Sir Horace . And then all the bits of stupid Sir Horace rolled all over the floor , and I stepped on his head and got my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a real head . Sir Horace is just a crummy old suit of armor that 's always hanging around here , lurking in various dark corners . I was yelling at it to get off and hopping around shaking my foot like crazy , but Sir Horace 's stupid head was totally stuck . Then , with really great timing , Aunt Tabby shouted , " Breakfast ! " in **74;276;TOOLONG voice  --  not that we have a cat , but she would if we did have one , I know she would . So I gave my foot the biggest shake ever  --  in fact , I am surprised my whole leg did n't come off  --  and Sir Horace 's helmet flew off , shot out of the bedroom door , and hurtled down the attic stairs . It made a fantastic noise . I could hear it all the way down to the basement . Sound travels really well in this house , so I could easily hear Aunt Tabby 's scream , too . I thought I 'd better get going , so I slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to see if Uncle Drac had gone to sleep yet  --  he works nights  --  because if he had , I was going to wake him up and make him come downstairs with me just in case Aunt Tabby was going to pitch a fit . His bedroom door is the little red one at the end of the top corridor , the one that goes to the turret . I was very careful pushing the door open , as it 's a sheer drop down for miles . Uncle Drac took all the floors out of the turret so that his bats could fly wherever they wanted . Uncle Drac loves his bats ; he 'd do anything for them . I love bats too . They are so sweet . I pushed Big Bat out of the way , and he fell all the way down to the bottom of the turret . It did n't matter , though , as the floor of the turret is about ten feet deep in bat poo , so it 's very soft . Without Big Bat clogging up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag . It was hanging from one of the joists like a great big flowery bat  --  and it was empty . Great , I thought , he 's still downstairs with Aunt Tabby . So , to save time , I slid down the big stairs ' banister and the basement stairs ' banister too  --  which I 'm not meant to do as it keeps falling over  --  and I was outside the **47;352;TOOLONG in no time . It was suspiciously quiet in there . Oops , I thought , trouble . I pushed open the door really considerately , and I was glad I did as Aunt Tabby was sitting at the end of the long table , buttering some toast in a way that made you think the toast had said something really personal and rude . It did n't look like a fun breakfast time , I thought . The signs were not good . First not-good sign : sitting in the middle of the table was Sir Horace 's helmet . It had a lot more dents in it than when I last saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was okay when it left my foot . Second , third , fourth , and fifth not-good signs : Aunt Tabby was covered in soot  --  apart from two little windows in her glasses which she had wiped clear so that she could attack the toast . Aunt Tabby being covered in soot is one of the worst signs . It means she has had a fight with the boiler and the boiler has won . I sat down in my seat in a thoughtful and caring way . Uncle Drac looked really relieved to see me . You see , I live with my aunt and uncle because my parents went vampire hunting in Transylvania when I was little and they never came back . Uncle Drac was busy scraping out the last bit of his boiled egg , and he had soot all around his mouth from the sooty toast that Aunt Tabby had buttered for him . " Hello , Minty , " he said . " Hello , Uncle Drac , " I said . I tried to think of something nice to say to Aunt Tabby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all with Sir Horace 's helmet staring at me with its little beady eyes . It does n't really have eyes , of course , but I often used to think it was looking at me , even though I was sure it was nothing more than an empty tin can . Aunt Tabby plonked my bowl of oatmeal down in front of me , so I said , " Thank you , Aunt Tabby . " And then , because Aunt Tabby likes polite conversation at breakfast , I said , " Have you been having trouble with the boiler again , Aunt Tabby ? " " Yes , dear  --  but not for very much longer , " Aunt Tabby said , hardly moving her lips . I used to think that when Aunt Tabby spoke like that she was practicing to be a ventriloquist , but now I know it means she has made her mind up about something and she does n't care whether you agree with her or not .
