. Striped bass are so plentiful and so eager to feed that even novice anglers can get in on the action . GANNETS ARE EVERYWHERE , wheeling , screeching and diving on hapless baitfish driven to the surface by marauding striped bass . The slaughter is so devastating that scales from the devoured menhaden shimmer in the sunlight as they drift through the water . Fishing just does n't get any better , and , starting in September , the pace gets crazier as ocean waters chill and migrating schools of predatory fish head south , feeding with abandon . This is the fall run , when striped bass head from the waters off New England to their wintering stations near Virginia and North Carolina . Along the way they will take every opportunity to gorge themselves on a buffet of forage fish moving out of bays and coastal rivers . With the population of these gamefish at historically high levels as a result of over 20 years of strict management programs , anglers , even the neophytes among us , have never had greater opportunities to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should get familiar with the variety of techniques experienced anglers have used with success . There are many techniques that make prospecting for " linesider " gold easy , but few are more consistently productive than trolling . Whether you spend the money on a pair of wire line outfits replete with the large lures designed for them , or if your fishing is a bit more casual and you opt for a few light outfits and some deep-diving plugs , you 're guaranteed to catch bass this fall . Finding the fish at this time of year is the easiest part of the game . Bass spend much of their time close to the beach , rarely moving more than a mile or two off . Their habit of staying close in accounts for the hundreds of anglers lining the beaches along the Northeastern coastline , surf-fishing . Chances are you will encounter vast schools of small menhaden driven right into the wash by stripers bent on turning them into fat stores for the coming winter . Watch for bird activity as searching gannets and terns will pinpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's a good bet they 're over stripers that are driving the bait to the surface . If the birds are not marking the spots for you , then use your depthfinder ; it 's like a second pair of eyes that can locate predators and prey . If you 're really serious about catching a cow  --  the term given to stripers over 35 pounds  --  then trolling bunker spoons ( metal lures the size of hubcaps ) with wire line is the way to go . Wire requires special rods and reels designed for the rigors the stuff inflicts on tackle . Why wire ? It provides " depth control " by allowing you to place lures at predetermined depths as gauged by the amount of wire line you have in the water . The rule of thumb is 10 to 1 , so if you put 200 feet of wire out your lure will be tracking 20 feet down . Stripers spend most of their time in the lower third of the water column . If you can present lures in the " zone " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't your idea of fun , rig up a few medium-action conventional outfits with super braid line made from Spectra or Dyneema . Then get a bunch of deep-diving plugs , like Mann 's Stretch 25s . At striper trolling speed they dig in and get down 20 or 30 feet , where they wiggle enticingly and encourage passing bass to take a swipe at them . A typical outfit will have 300 yards of 30- or 50-pound braid over mono backing and six feet of 50-pound test fluorocarbon leader with a snap at the end to make changing lures quick and easy . Set two or three of these plugs behind the boat , staggered between 100 and 150 feet , and the bass will jump all over them . Do n't be afraid to mix up your trolling pattern ; any angler who fishes for stripers on a regular basis will vary his spread . Try a couple of wire line outfits with a braid outfit and a deep-running plug down the middle . That way you 're covered no matter what the stripers want . BOX Bucket Brigade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slower is definitely better . Whether you are fishing with wire or braid , your boat has to be capable of trolling down to three knots . If too much speed is a problem for your rig , here 's a cheap fix that will scuff off the excess . Rig a five-gallon bucket with ten feet of 3/8-inch nylon line tied to the handle . Attach it to the spring cleat so the bucket is hanging in the water alongside the transom . One bucket is sufficient for most slow speed-challenged craft , but I 've seen sterndrive- and diesel-powered boats that required two  --  one on each side .
