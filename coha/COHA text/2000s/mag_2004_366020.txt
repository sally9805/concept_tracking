In the auditorium of Tripoli 's Corinthia Hotel , a number of Libyan officials sit onstage in dark suits and ties , addressing scores of Western executives in flawless English about the country 's new business opportunities . A few feet away is a huge portrait of the most famous face in Libya , Muammar Gaddafi , in his trademark African robe and sunglasses , fist in the air , a defiant look on his face , as if to say to the roomful of businessmen , I still run things around here . But the businessmen do n't seem to notice . Instead they are transfixed by a tall young man with wire-rimmed spectacles and a fashionably shaved head . When he talks about a new economic strategy for Libya , including private enterprise , job creation and international financial institutions , the audience hangs on his words . After decades of centralized state control , he says , " we have a new reality in Libya . " <P> The hip speaker should know . He is Seif al-Islam Gaddafi , the second son of Libya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year coaxing his father into transforming his 35-year-old revolution , which Gaddafi has led since he waged a military coup in 1969 . The aging revolutionary has ruled over a centralized socialist system , repressing dissent and supporting armed attacks against American targets . Seif , 32 , is believed by many analysts and diplomats to be Gaddafi 's probable political heir . He is a doctoral student at the London School of Economics , a skilled artist and a keen tennis player who frequents the courts of Tripoli 's Regatta Club , a favorite beachside haunt for the city 's resident expatriates and Libyan lite . With no official role in government , Seif heads the Qaddafi International Foundation , a quasi-independent organization that has negotiated hostage releases and sent relief aid around Africa . He finally persuaded his 62-year-old father to make peace with the international community  --  thus opening the country to foreign investment . " It took nine months  --  nine months ! " Seif told TIME , stretching his long legs out in front of the couch under another portrait of his father . <P> Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still unclear . But Gaddafi agreed to curtail Libya 's nuclear-weapons program as well as pay damages to the families of those killed in the 1988 Pan Am airline bombing over Lockerbie , Scotland , and the non-American survivors of the 1986 bombing of a West Berlin discothque . As a result , President Bush announced he would begin lifting economic sanctions against Libya . The European Union recently followed . " It was the right decision , " says Seif of his father 's new Western-friendly stance , " the right initiative . " <P> Since then investors and business executives of all stripes have poured into Libya  --  especially oil executives . Oil accounts for more than 90% of Libya 's revenues . At a time when world oil prices are over $50 per bbl. , analysts estimate that Libya 's known oil reserves hold 30 billion bbl.  --  more than $1 trillion worth  --  enough to keep the pumps turning in Libya for decades . What 's more , only about 25% of the country has yet been explored . Already this year , some 120 companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new oil in 15 areas ; the bid results are expected in January .
