Scotman Thomas Sutherland , a manager at a shipping company , wisely recognized the profits to be had in the burgeoning trade in a developing market like China . The bank he helped start , Hongkong and Shanghai , now called HSBC , became one of China 's top financial institutions within just a few years of its founding . That was in 1865 . <P> Today history is going full circle . The London-based megabank  --  the world 's second largest bank by market value in mid-January  --  is returning to its roots . China , the world 's fastest-growing economy , is the hottest market in global finance , sending international banks on a mad scramble for acquisitions and customers . <P> And HSBC is sitting pretty . It boasts the most extensive branch network of any foreign bank on the mainland , with 20 outlets spread from Chengdu in the far west to Tianjin on the northeast coast . The bank has invested more than $4 billion since 2001 to buy stakes in Chinese financial institutions , including nearly 20% in both Bank of Communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance , its second biggest life insurer . Compared with the same period in 2004 , pretax profits in China increased sixfold , to $161 million , in the first half of 2005 .

From South Korea to India to Brazil , HSBC is expanding its branch network , launching new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired 10% of Vietnam 's Techcombank ; in November HSBC said it planned to launch the first independent investment bank in Saudi Arabia ; and in late October it purchased 70% of an investment bank called Dar Es Salaam in , of all places , Iraq . Says Stephen Green , HSBC 's global chief executive , who in November was named the bank 's next chairman : " These are markets into which we should be prepared to invest significant dollars . " <P> Much of the world remains unbanked . China 's 1.3 billion people , for example , carry about 10 million credit cards , compared with 1.2 billion in the U.S. In Mexico only 1 in 5 people has a bank account . Rising middle classes in developing countries are low-hanging fruit for multinational financial-services companies . " In the next 25 years , you 'll see economic wealth distributed more evenly with the world 's population , " says John Bond , HSBC 's outgoing chairman . " Demand for financial services in emerging markets is going to grow consistently and probably grow faster than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
