This is how Steve Stiletto , drop-dead gorgeous , globe-trotting photographer , finally got me , Bubbles Yablonsky , Pennsylvania hairstylist and occasional newspaper reporter , to break my chastity vow . I was relaxing on the back porch one golden , late-summer evening , polishing my nails to a deep and glossy plum . A few of my neighbor Mrs. Hamel 's red tomatoes in our shared garden were plump on the vine . The tiny green grapes were coming into their own and the steel mill was closing down for the night with a pump , pump , pump . Suddenly the backyard gate swung open and there stood Stiletto , tall and tanned from India 's hot sun . He was wearing tight jeans , the familiar worn leather bomber jacket over his broad shoulders , and those Mel Gibson eyes of his were twinkling their mischievous blue . " You 're back , " I whispered , the nail polish bottle tumbling down the porch steps . " Yablinko , " was all he said before leaning down to kiss me , hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With one movement he swooped me up in his strong arms , and I felt helpless as he kicked open the screen door and carried me upstairs . " But . . . " I protested weakly . " Shhh . " He placed me gently on the bed and let his lips trace the curve of my neck . " Listen . I nearly went mad in the desert without you , Bubbles . Marry me . " He had done it . Stiletto had uttered those two magic words and I was now released from my chastity vow , free to respond with a lusty abracadabra . After our first , passionate moment of lovemaking , which was furtive and desperate , I ran my plum nails over his broad chest and down his muscular thighs , drinking in the warmth of him , the tingling satisfaction of our mingling . " Oh , Steve , you 're so- " " For the one thousandth time it 's Chip . Chip . Chip . Chip ! When in the hell are you gon na get that straight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I found myself staring into a fleshy , white shoulder . " Aaaagh , " I screamed . My hands squeezed what they had been gripping under the covers . Not muscle . Flab . Mounds and mounds of gut . " Oww , stop that . You 're hurting me . " I bolted upright , pulling the sheets tightly around me . " Oh . . . my . . . God . " Dan the Man , my fat , adulterous , ambulance-chasing lawyer of an ex-husband , lay next to me in bed , arms behind his head , a scowl on his face . " No one calls me Dan anymore , " he said . " Everyone calls me Chip . All except you and those buffoons down at Legal Aid . " " Where 's Steve ? " " Steve ? You mean that punk photographer ? How in the bejeezus am I supposed to know ? " Stiletto 's return from overseas must have been a dream . My stomach felt weak and nauseous . I was afraid I 'd throw up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a headache , like I 'd been crowned by an anvil . " I think I 'm going to be sick , " I croaked . " Would n't be surprised considering the condition you came in last night , Bubbles . " Dan threw back the covers , revealing his blubbery belly and a pair of ripped , yellow-striped boxer shorts . " Boy , were you sloshed . You passed out here , right on the convertible couch . " " I was not sloshed , " I lied . " I was just very , very tired . " " Right . And as a former Lehigh University frat boy I do n't know from tanked . " Dan snorted as he made his way to the bathroom . " Getting blotto was my major . I graduated summa cum laude in alcohol overload . " Could Dan have been right ? Could I , Bubbles Yablonsky , thirty-four-year-old single mother , hairdresser , aspiring investigative journalist and one of the few living Polish-Lithuanian Barbie dolls in Lehigh , Pennsylvania , have allowed myself to get , gasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It tastes gross and . . . I dropped the sheet . I was still wearing my spiffy fire-engine-red sequined dress , now wrinkled and reeking of cigarette smoke . My black hose were bunched at the ankles and a gigantic run exposed my big toe . Ohhh . I collapsed in a heap of self loathing , painfully recalling how I 'd spent the night before-at the bachelorette party for Lehigh Police Department records clerk Janice Kramer , fiance of Detective Mickey Sinkler and my best source for sealed search warrants . It was those darn strawberry-kiwi Jell-O shots Janice 's coworkers at the police department brought to the party . They must 've been spiked . I winced at the memory of me howling Lynyrd Skynyrd 's " Free Bird " into the karaoke machine at Uncle Manny 's Bar and Grille , which had opened on a Sunday night just to host our festivities . Janice had covered her mouth first in shock and then in delight when I jumped onto the pool table to play air guitar while the other partygoers whooped and cheered . Only Manny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels digging into the green felt . To top it off I had evidently teetered home and passed out next to my ex , Dan the Man , who-at the insistence of our daughter , Jane-had been sleeping on our pull-out couch ever since his socialite wife Wendy had given him the heave-ho two weeks ago . Of this I was certain , however : while I had slept with Dan , I had not slept with Dan . A bug trap full of Spanish flies could n't make me do that . What I needed was sleep , a tall glass of ginger ale , two aspirin and a hot shower with plenty of Ivory soap . But mostly sleep . I closed my eyes and drifted off . " Hey , are n't you supposed to be getting ready for that wedding ? " Dan was suited up for his Legal Aid job and munching on a hoagie . " I thought by the time I returned for lunch you 'd be long gone . It 's eleven-thirty . " Mickey and Janice 's wedding . It was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor ! " How long did I sleep ? " Dan checked his watch . " About four hours . " " Why did n't you wake me ? " " What do I look like ? Your personal valet ? " I leapt out of bed . Here I was , unwashed and hungover , lazing about while Mickey 's sweet bride , a kind and shy woman who had trusted me to lead her down the aisle , was probably pacing the narthex in frantic worry . Ugh . I pushed Dan aside and scrambled up the stairs to the bathroom . Usually a Bubbles Deluxe took a good forty-five minutes if my Sunshine Blonde Number Eight locks were to be teased and sprayed into an indestructible beehive . Eyebrow penciling alone could eat up five . I had , what , ten minutes tops to shower and change into a Bo Peep bridesmaid 's outfit complete with hoopskirt , bonnet and satin-covered staff . There was no way I could get to the church in time . At best , I 'd arrive right when Mickey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed . For as I was soon to discover , there would be no blushing bride and beaming groom emerging from St. Lenny 's South Side Catholic Church . No dollar dance at Walp 's and fancy smorgasbord . No four-night , three-day honeymoon in the Pocono Mountains sipping sparkling wine by a Hotel Paupack heart-shaped bathtub . There would be no wedding . Only murder . Looking back , I blame the Skynyrd.  --  From Bubbles in Trouble by Sarah Strohmeyer ( c ) June 2002 , used by permission .
