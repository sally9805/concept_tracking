In the time just after the big war , when banks were n't to be trusted and when snapper turtle stew , a cheap meal for the big families common in those days , bubbled on stovetops in farm kitchens , the three Richter brothers led Lester Sutter to the edge of Spider Lake to watch him drown through the sights of their rifles . They drove him in with the barrels of their guns and stood guard among the cattails as the water filled his boots and soaked his overalls . The rocks they 'd stuffed and then stitched into his pockets sank him . Lester Sutter had earned this . Even if he was n't quite right in the mind , thought the brothers , he should have known better than to violate their sister . Only an hour before , Herman Richter , the middle brother , had ordered Liesel , the Richters ' only sister , to stay in the house . He directed his other brothers to hide in the grove and wait for Lester Sutter to come . He always came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grove until Liesel came out with the supper slops . He would slink around the oak trees . Sometimes he sat at the foot of a tree trunk and watched Liesel from afar . Sometimes he trailed back and forth , just a few feet behind her , as she bustled about the yard . When she 'd whip around to face him and plant her hands on her hips , he 'd turn around too , show her his back , and pretend to be studying some far-off cloud or tree . She usually smiled and returned to her work without scolding him . Liesel had always been far too permissive . Sometimes Lester approached her , and they talked . Of what , Herman had no idea . Lester Sutter was dense as pipe smoke . At times , Liesel put Lester to work hoeing in her garden or carrying heavy water pails from the well to the house . Though Liesel had insisted she did n't mind Lester 's company , Herman did . He told her to stay away from Lester . But she had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , splashing at the water 's edge , taking a few steps forward and then backing toward the shore , croaking like some amphibious animal and making this deed harder than it needed to be . " Get in the water , Lester , " Herman Richter yelled . His eyes were pale blue and his ears bright red . He spoke in English but with a slight German accent . The Richters ' papa , a German immigrant , spoke German but had learned English well and had insisted his children do the same . Lester Sutter turned to face the brothers on the shore . He worked out the meaning of the words and mouthed them with his thin and cracked lips . Then he imitated Herman Richter : " Get in ta water . " Herman fumed . He directed the tip of his gun back and forth between Lester 's chest and the middle of the lake . " Get in , " he said . " Get in , " repeated Lester . He giggled and glanced from one brother 's face to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herman . His brothers looked at him . One told him to take it easy . " I have shot better men than this , " Herman yelled . " I will not hesitate to shoot this dog too . " But really , Herman hoped he would n't have to . He hated guns and killing and blood . Why could n't Lester see that Herman was giving him a chance to do the dignified thing and die on his own terms ? Sweat ran from Lester 's head into his eyes . As a boy , he had pulled out all of his eyelashes , and now none grew . The rims were perpetually red and irritated , but the whites of his eyes were always clear and not a red vein crossed them , not even when the sweat nipped at his eyeballs like the bites of hay mites . Lester knew what a gun could do . His own pa hunted with one , and Lester did n't want to risk the blast of smoke and bullet by disobeying the men . He did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart or anywhere . The day was cloudy . Heat a man could reach out and hold was trapped between the earth and sky . The sun throbbed against the backs of the clouds , waiting for its chance to press through and ignite the day . Lester Sutter , standing now knee-deep in Spider Lake and wringing his hands , was n't an educated man . He suffered from the sort of weakness that came from years of hard blows from his pa 's fists . He did n't understand why he was here , why these brothers , his neighbors , whom he 'd always thought were friendly , were pointing guns at him . At first , he 'd thought maybe they were playing a game . But now he was scared and wanted to see Liesel . The youngest gun-toter , Otto Richter , no more than a boy really , a boy who had fished and hunted turtles with Lester Sutter many a time , saw that he was confused . So Otto looked up from his rifle , unsquinted his aiming eyes , and yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said to get in the water , Lester . " Lester waved to Otto , then pointed to himself and said , " It 's me . Lester . " " I know , " said Otto . The boy was shushed by Herman and told to get his gun back up . Otto rested the thick wood of it against his bony shoulder . His long bangs hung nearly into his eyes . " Do not talk to him , " said Herman . He took short steps on the shoreline toward Lester , closing the distance between them to fewer than a few steps . He pointed the gun from Lester to the middle of the lake again . " Get in , Lester , " he said . " We do n't have all day . " Lester understood finally and backed up . Dark fingers of lake water curled around his thighs and bade them come in . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
