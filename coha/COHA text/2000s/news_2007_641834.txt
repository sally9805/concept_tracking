<p> People who watch TV on older television sets without the aid of cable or satellite service will be forced into the digital age in February 2009 . <p> Although it 's more than a year off , the analog-to-digital conversion is weighing heavy on the minds of those charged with easing the transition for the public and for manufacturers making converter boxes . <p> " What we need to do right now is get consumers aware of what is happening and what their choices are , " said Debra Berlyn , AARP federal affairs consultant . <p> The federal government wants to use the existing analog-TV spectrum for emergency communication . <p> About 20 million American households rely on free , over-the-air analog signals for TV , according to the National Association of Broadcasters , a trade association representing more than 8,300 free , local radio and TV stations . <p> Another 14.6 million households have secondary over-the air TV sets , generally a second or third TV in a kitchen or bedroom not equipped with cable or satellite . Those TVs will need to be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box or signed up for cable or satellite service , said Shermaze L. Ingram , spokeswoman for the NAB 's digital television transition department . <p> This January , analog-to- <p> digital converter boxes will hit store shelves to help consumers make the transition . <p> To date , three manufacturers have announced plans to put a converter box on the market in early 2008 - LG , Thomson/RCA and Samsung . More manufacturers are expected to join them later . <p> " The converter box comes with all you need . a red , yellow and white cable and a remote control , " Ingram said . " Your rabbit ears ( or rooftop antenna ) are still your way of getting the ( digital ) signal . You grab it out of the air , and then your converter box becomes the translator . " <p> The LG box will be available at retail stores , such as Circuit City , Wal-Mart and Radio Shack , said John I. Taylor , vice president of public affairs for LG Electronics USA . <p> " Our goal is to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We expect it to cost $60 . " <p> Both Taylor and the NAB said that rabbit-ear viewers will see a remarkable improvement in TV reception when they connect a converter . Digital-TV signals are transmitted in DVD-like quality . <p> Consumers do n't have to wait until 2009 to use their new converter box , as 92 percent of local broadcasters nationwide are already sending out digital signals . <p> Financial aid is available to offset the cost of a converter box through a government coupon system beginning Jan. 1 , 2008 . Every U.S. household is eligible for two $40 coupons that can be used on certain converter boxes at participating retail stores . The federal government has set aside a total of $990 million for the coupons and $5 million for a consumer education program . <p> " We always contemplated that there would be a modest cost for consumers , " Taylor said . " This is not a high-margin product but the right thing to do to support the nation 's transition to digital TV . " <p> But some people , particularly those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on federal rules about who is eligible for a coupon . According to the rules , only those homes that have a distinct address and/or apartment number fall under the definition of a household to qualify for a coupon . <p> The current definition would leave out people living in nursing homes , group homes and assisted-living facilities , said the AARP 's Berlyn . <p> " The ( government ) is using the definition of household that does n't seem to cover certain types of institutions , " she said . <p> However , U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl , D-Wis. , introduced a bill last week that would give those without cable or satellite priority in receiving a coupon for two digital converter boxes . <p> It would also make those living in nursing homes and other nontraditional households eligible for a coupon , establish a grant program for agencies to help seniors and make public service announcements about the transition mandatory . <p> Berlyn said seniors may have difficulty understanding their need for a digital TV and some may simply be unable to move large TVs to even hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps have more challenges to meet in terms of making this transition work for them , " Berlyn said . " AARP is working with the federal agencies and Congress on some of these challenges . " <p> Kimberly S.
