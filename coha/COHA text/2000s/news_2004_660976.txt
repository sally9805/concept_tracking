<p> Last fall , a brand new BMW 3-series car rolled into the Old Dominion Carstar Collision Center in Eugene , Ore . - literally . A teenager was " driving dad 's car , " says shop owner Patty McConnell , and rolled it over - with little apparent structural damage . The teen walked away , and normally the damage would n't have been hard to repair . But the BMW had so many air bags " it looked like a balloon , " recalls Ms. McConnell . The new car , worth more than $ 30,000 , was totaled . <p> Costly air bags , expensive electronics , and lightweight body materials are driving up the cost of fixing new cars . Not only do many more parts have to be replaced rather than repaired , but fewer and fewer body shops can afford the special equipment and training required to do the work . " We 're moving closer and closer to the disposable car , " says Dan Bailey , an executive vice president at Carstar , the largest auto-body repair franchise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade ago , for example , cost an average of $ 2,578 per claim , while in 2003 , the cost had ballooned to $ 3,681 , a 43 percent increase that has outpaced inflation , says Kim Hazelbaker , senior vice president and head of loss claims analysis with the Highway Loss Data Institute ( HLDI ) in Arlington , Va . <p> Normally it takes a lot of damage to total a brand-new vehicle . Insurance companies calculate the value of a car before the accident and subtract its value as scrap . As long as the result is more than the cost of repair , the car is worth fixing . <p> But many new cars today cost so much to fix that it 's becoming harder to justify repairs . The BMW that hit McConnell 's shop had dual front , side , and side- curtain air bags . Federal safety rules do not allow air bags to be reused . So each bag would have had to be replaced with a brand new one . The sensors and pyrotechnics that set them off also required replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 for each air bag , and even more for the sensors , and the result is a totaled car . <p> Before the advent of air bags , only 8 percent of damaged cars were totaled . Today , the figure is nearly 20 percent and rising . " As they continue to put more air bags in these vehicles , the figure is going to continue to escalate , " says Mr. Bailey of Carstar . Not only do the number of air bags ( two in front have been required since 1996 ) increase costs , today 's new " smart " air bags , with sensors that control whether they deploy and how hard , cost more than older bags . Seat belts , too , have " once-and-done " pretensioners that have to be replaced - even on unoccupied seats - after an accident . <p> " There are a lot of electronics in cars today that were n't there in the past , " says Mr. Hazelbaker of HLDI . " And if they 're damaged , they are going to have to be bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you 're going to pay full retail price . " <p> While air bags are the most expensive technology to repair after a crash , other high-tech items are also pushing up repair costs . For example , the world 's bestselling vehicle , Ford 's F150 pickup , uses a magnesium radiator mount - which gets crunched every time an F150 runs into anything . Magnesium is strong and light , but brittle . Even if it bends without breaking in an accident , a body shop ca n't bend it back . Like air bags , it has to be replaced at a cost of more than $ 300 . <p> To meet fuel-economy requirements , automakers are using more lightweight parts . Magnesium , titanium , and carbonized plastic are among the rapidly expanding number of components found under the hood . <p> And then there 's aluminum . At least five cars come with all-aluminum bodies and frames , including the Audi A8 , Acura NSX , Honda Insight , Mercedes CL , and the new Jaguar XJ8 . So far , few body shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 13 body shops nationwide can do repairs on the XJ8 . So if you wreck one in a remote area , insurance companies will factor in the cost of shipping it to an authorized shop . <p> Body shops that deal with aluminum have to wall off separate work areas and buy tools separate from those used on steel cars . That 's because steel shavings can contaminate aluminum . <p> Because aluminum is difficult to weld , most parts are " bonded " ( glued ) and riveted together . A riveting tool to replace aluminum parts costs $ 10,000 . Another tool to remove rivets runs $ 9,000 . The total investment in training and tools to run an aluminum-body repair shop can run as much as $ 200,000 . <p> " If we 're going to keep up with changes in the industry in the next three to four years , it 's going to take a bigger investment than we have ever seen , " says Mr. Bailey . He predicts almost half of today 's repair shops wo n't make that investment . <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-tech parts can leave you with big repair bills . The celebrated find for car thieves these days is xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights . They can cost up to $ 3,000 each . That 's just for the part , not labor . <p> Stories of thieves ripping these headlights out of Audis and Nissans - and doing thousands more in body damage - are becoming legion in urban areas . Even when the lights are n't stolen , repairs can be expensive . One body shop that had to remove the lights from a new Audi A8 found they had to be sent back to the manufacturer to be reactivated ; otherwise , they would n't work . <p> Now Nissan and other automakers have started using taillights with multiple LEDs rather than a single inexpensive light bulb . The LEDs light faster in a panic stop to give drivers following more warning , but they 're also more expensive to replace . <p> From headlights to taillights , nothing is getting simpler in cars today . As a result , insurers are expecting higher premiums for these premium cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates on cars with xenon headlights . " Aluminum cars are too new to have reliable figures . And the companies are trying to stay competitive . But it will happen , " he says of higher rates for aluminum cars . <p> To reduce costs , the repair industry is now pushing for measures that would allow body shops to use " preowned " never-used air bags from cars in junkyards . " That will have to come , " says Bailey . <p> Meanwhile , the industry is bracing for more and more technology . " This is something the automakers have to do to meet their fuel economy requirements , " says Bailey . " And we 're going to have to learn to deal with it . " <p> As cars get more complicated , fewer skilled technicians to repair them <p> If today 's cars are harder to repair , the skills needed to repair them are also harder to come by . <p> Technicians - do n't dare call them mechanics - often have to complete four years of school : two years of technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that , a student works as an apprentice for three years before being fully qualified . <p> Automotive technicians held about 818,000 jobs in 2002 , according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics . That figure is expected to increase by 10 to 20 percent annually . <p> " There 's no shortage of general technicians , but there is a big shortage of qualified people to work on drivability and emissions issues , " says Robert Rodriguez of Automotive Service Excellence . The Leesburg , Va. , organization certifies repair shops and technicians . <p> These specialist technicians need advanced reading , problem-solving , and basic electronics skills , he says . " The best people to find are those who have worked in the IT information technology industry , " he says . <p> Twenty years ago , repair manuals for certain cars were 100 or so pages long . Now , they hold over 1 million pages and are available only electronically , says John Paul , who handles repair-shop certification for AAA Southern New England . <p> Schooling at the Universal Technical Institute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs up to $ 15,000 , depending on proficiency . And technicians have to buy their own tools at a cost of $ 10,000 or more . <p> " We have to fight to get people who are bright and motivated , " says Mr. Rodriguez . " There is tremendous pressure in society against letting little Johnny go into car repair , " he says , adding , " I would n't want my kid to become a mechanic . " <p> So recruiters are turning more to women and immigrants . More technical manuals are written in Spanish , says Rodriguez , who remains hopeful that the gap will be filled with time . " There are still a lot of these guys that have gas in their blood and all they want to do is work on cars , " he says . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
