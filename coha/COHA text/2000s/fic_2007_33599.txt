Chapter One San Antonio , Texas July 25 , 1973 Captain Russell Jefferson ran his fingers through his dark hair and shifted his weight impatiently in the deep , soft chair . He glanced at his wristwatch . Two minutes since he had last checked . He felt the waiting room closing in on him . He was the only person in the room except for the receptionist , who was typing and seemed to have forgotten he was there . She seemed also unaware that time no longer moved . He started to say something to her , then changed his mind . He looked at his watch again and stood . The United States Air Force uniform , its insignias and silver wings gleaming , fit Russ Jefferson 's six-foot frame perfectly . Although he could n't have been much more than thirty , his expression , hardened by conflict or pain , made him seem older . He moved about uncertainly . He rubbed the back of his neck . His eyes darted back and forth at every small noise . Now he turned squarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three . Are you sure he wants to see me again ? " She stopped typing , looked at him , and said , " It 's only five after , Captain . The doctor will see you in a moment . " She gave him a brief , understanding smile and then quickly turned away , perhaps to avoid staring at the scars . They were ugly , covering the cheek and temple at his left eye and extending above his eyebrow . Her fingers had become a blur over the Selectric typewriter when the intercom buzzed . She picked up the phone , pushed the lit intercom button , and answered , looking at him . " You may go in now , " she said as she returned the receiver to its cradle . He thanked her , crossed the room , and opened the wide door of the office . A heavy , balding man rose from behind a cluttered desk . His thick glasses reflected light from the overhead fluorescents . " Come in , Captain , " the psychiatrist said . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't answer , taking the chair indicated by the doctor . " And it 's soon to be Major Jefferson , is n't it ? " A perfunctory smile appeared . " Congratulations on your promotion . " " Thanks . " " When do you pin on the gold leafs ? " " A couple of weeks . " The psychiatrist sat down and began a search of his desktop . The smile did n't last long . " Things been going okay since we last talked ? " " I guess so . No problems . " " You look tanned and fit . " " A few rays at the pool . Not much else to do . " " Ah , yes , I am your last hurdle , are n't I ? " the doctor said , as if they were old friends . He found the file he was looking for and opened it . The friendly tone did n't work . Russ remained edgy . " Yes , you are , " he said . " You 've come a long way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned a page , glanced at it , and put the file down . " I 'm impressed . " " Impressed ? " " Yes . Yes , I am . " " Do n't be impressed with me . I just lay there . The docs did the work . " " I 'm told you were very cooperative . " The doctor removed a pipe from an ashtray and began filling it with tobacco from a leather pouch . " Did I have a choice ? " The laugh was an abrupt snort . " I suppose it seemed that you did n't . But you did well in physical therapy . That was a lot of painful work , Captain . " Russ said nothing . " I see in your file that Dr. Pendleton recommended further plastic surgery . He said that your scars could be minimized . Perhaps two more procedures . " With a pudgy index finger , he gently tamped the tobacco in the bowl . " Why did n't you let him do that ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitches and staples . " The pilot shrugged . " Besides , the eye works . " " You 're very fortunate , you know . No permanent damage to your vision . " " Yeah . That was my lucky day , all right . " Casually , the doctor jotted a note as he asked , " How are you feeling about things now ? " " Things ? What things ? " " Things we 've talked about before . " Russ shifted restlessly . " Fine , " he said . " Really terrific . " " You seem a bit agitated . Something happen ? " " No . I just do n't think this is necessary . " " Do n't you ? " The doctor struck a match . He held the match just above the bowl and began puffing slowly . " I do n't know why I 'm here . " " Nothing sinister . Nothing mysterious . " The doctor 's round face was half hidden behind the smoke . " We need to talk about your capture , Captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . " " We 're completing our interviews with you now . All of you . " " Interviews ? " A cynical smile appeared briefly on the captain 's face . " Yes . There 's always much to learn from the human experience . " The man behind the desk puffed again . " You and the others experienced a lot of pain during the time you were POWs . " Russ 's expression did not change . " Self-discipline , Captain . When you were released , every one of you wore a somber face until you were on the plane because you did n't want the North Vietnamese to see any expression of emotion . That 's amazing control . Yes , there 's a great deal we can learn from you . " " Fighter pilots have a reputation for being loose , but we do know about discipline , " Russ started to explain , then wondered why he was bothering . No need getting into a useless exercise . " Doctor , is there some particular reason I 'm here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your shoulders . The burns . " " And so ? " " And so the Air Force decided you should spend some time with guys like me . " " To see if we 've become a bunch of psychotic cripples ? " " It could be useful . You 've known a lot of mental and emotional turmoil , Captain . There may be things you want to get off your chest , things you might not want to say to a friend or a relative . " " I really do n't need this . " Russ stood abruptly and walked over to the window . He stared out into the glare of the Texas sun . An enlisted man in a work uniform was mowing grass . " Perhaps you 're right , but I do n't think it can do any harm . Do you ? " The doctor sounded nonthreatening , speaking slowly and softly . " We can finish up today . " The pilot stood silently for several moments , still looking out the window . Then he said , " Your job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes . " Russ hesitated , shrugged a reluctant agreement , and returned to his chair . He tried to find a comfortable position . " Okay . Go . " " Are you hanging out with your friends ? " " A couple of guys are still here . " " Do you spend much time with them ? " " We get together for dinner once in a while . " " How are they ? " " Okay , I guess . " " Are they feeling all right about things ? " " Yeah , except for being bugged by you guys . " " Have they received their assignments ? " " We all have . " " Your friends are returning to the cockpit , are n't they ? They 're going back to fighter squadrons . " " Yeah . " " But you 're not ? " " That 's right . " Russ 's tone became more defensive . The doctor leaned forward , his chin jutting . Behind the thick lenses , his eyes were penetrating . " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Flew up to Kansas City . Went to their home Wednesday night . " " Did you have a long visit ? " " With his mother . An hour , I guess . " " Was it difficult ? " " Of course . Do n't you think it 'd be difficult to talk to her after you 've killed her son ? " " You did n't kill her son . " " He was my backseater . It was my responsibility to get him back from the mission . " " How did you feel after talking to her ? " " I do n't know . " " Of course you do , " said the doctor . " You felt better . Or worse . " " She was nice . It was hard . " " Did you feel less guilty after you talked to her ? " " No . " The doctor paused thoughtfully , and Russ knew the line of questioning was about to change . " Tell me , " the heavy man finally said , " how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight ? " " Better than if I had been sent into the war and not allowed to fight . " " Shooting down the two MiGs . Killing two pilots . How do you feel about that ? " " Pretty damned good . They were trying to shoot me down at the time . " " And the bombing missions ? Killing civilians ? " " Better them than me . " The doctor studied his pipe bowl , then looked at the younger man closely . Jefferson was discarding questions with cocky responses , a conditioned reflex . " What about the morality of the war , Captain ? " " That 's for religious scholars and Timothy Leary to work out . " " Will history judge us favorably ? " " If we wrote it , it might . But winners write the history . This time we are n't writing it . We lost . " The sound of a lawn mower 's small motor came through the closed windows . The doctor waited until it went away , then asked , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little better than I did a year ago . " " You 're single . Met any girls since you 've been back ? " " No . Have you ? " " I 'm not a hero flyboy , " the doctor said with a smile . " Besides , I 'm married . " " Congratulations . " " You were married . " " Yes . " " How long since the divorce ? " " A couple of months . " " Tough . Must 've been difficult to come back to a marriage and- " " I did n't come back to a marriage . " Russ shifted his weight uncomfortably . " She left me more than two years ago . The paperwork got held up . " " What caused the breakup ? " " Who knows ? Things . " " Let 's talk about your marriage . " " Let 's not . " Russ 's voice tightened as if his throat hurt . A different pain . " Where were you when the marriage broke up ? " " Broke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You make it sound like a train wreck . " " Maybe it was . What caused the wreck , Captain ? " " She did n't like life on a remote Air Force base in the middle of a desert . " The younger man 's eyes were coldly locked to the doctor 's . " She grew up in Beverly Hills . " " You were at that remote base when she married you . She must have seen something attractive about your life . " " At first she found it exciting and adventurous . But it turned out to be the wrong kind of excitement . The wrong kind of adventure . " He arched an eyebrow . " Where she was from , excitement was an afternoon polo match . Adventure was sailing to Santa Catalina . " " And ? " " And she soon learned she did n't belong in a world where her husband 's adventure is a war in Southeast Asia and excitement is staying alive . " An emotional silence gripped the room . A long , empty silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't normal . She could n't stay in it . " The doctor studied his pipe for a moment and then looked up . " Are you ready to face the world ? " " Is n't that your job ? " Russ asked through a half-smile . " To get me ready ? " " I 'll rephrase the question . Do you feel ready to reenter the world ? " " Doctor , I 'm on my way to London . Embassy duty . Know a better way to reenter than that ? " " Think you 're ready to handle the pressure ? " " It 's the embassy . Pressure ? Embassy pressure is like the pressure you work under . You screw up and you just stop at a bar on your way home and have a couple of fancy drinks with umbrellas in them . Fighter pilots work under a pressure that if you screw up , you 're a smoking hole . " " You do n't have to go to the embassy , " said the doctor . It sounded like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . You could 've had an assignment to F-4s in North Carolina . Practically at home . " Russ said nothing . He straightened in his chair . " Is n't that right ? " The nod was almost imperceptible . " Yes , " Russ said tightly . The doctor paused to relight his pipe . After he got it going again he squinted at his patient and in a cold voice asked , " Why did you choose the embassy ? " Russ 's eyes hardened . He looked at the doctor for a moment and then said , " Say again ? " " Why do n't you want to fly ? " Bright reflections in the thick eyeglasses obscured the doctor 's eyes . " Why did you ask your General Kreeger to get you an assignment to the safe work of an embassy rather than return to the cockpit ? " Russ leapt to his feet and pounded his fist down on the desktop with a loud crash . A framed picture toppled . " That 's enough ! " he hissed sharply . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out of the office , slamming the door behind him . Russ drove the rental car slowly toward the officers ' club . It was early . There was time for a drink before dinner . He concentrated on his driving , not for reasons of safety but in an attempt to block out the meeting with the psychiatrist . It did n't work . The questions kept ringing in his ears . Why ? Why ? Why was he alive and why was Noonan dead ? It was hot and the Texas summer had been dry . Sprinklers were busy on both sides of the street , silently swinging their clear arcs in large circles . Water was nurturing and keeping the grass alive , and he wondered what would nurture him , what would keep him alive . The shrink had hit a nerve . What caused the breakup ? He did n't want to think about Jenny . He had willed his mind to not think about her . There was too much pain and he had to shut out the hurt . Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you want to fly ? The one thing he had loved . The one thing he had done best . And he would n't return to it . Why had he chosen the embassy ? He did n't know . Why did n't he know what he wanted ? Only a few cars were in the parking lot , and he took a space near the entrance to the officers ' club . He strode into the main foyer and followed the wide hallway to the bar . It was a large , well-appointed room . He took a stool at the long L-shaped bar and looked around . The place was almost empty . Not like a fighter squadron 's club . One man sat at the other end , and a couple of others shared a small table near the bar . He ordered a bourbon and water . Russ glanced at the two officers at the table . They were wearing class B , short-sleeved uniforms and pilot wings . One was a lieutenant , the other a captain . Russ could see that the captain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand to depict an aircraft in a roll . Fighter pilots could n't talk about flying if they could n't use their hands . His drink was placed in front of him , and he lit a cigarette as he studied the amber liquid . At the small table , the captain illustrating the maneuver to his friend had n't noticed Jefferson enter the bar . He was saying , " So I was showing my student how smooth an aileron roll should be , " and then he suddenly stopped talking and became quiet . " I 'll be damned , " he said in a lowered voice . " What is it ? " asked the lieutenant as he turned to see what had distracted his friend . " Someone I never expected to see again . " The lieutenant turned back to the captain . " Who ? The guy at the end of the bar ? " " Yeah . " " You know him ? " " Not personally . He was at Udorn when I first got there . He shot down two MiGs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know him , but I knew who he was . Everybody knew who he was . " " Who is he ? " " That 's Russ Jefferson . One hell of a fighter pilot . Maybe the best of the best . Lots of people thought he 'd be wearing stars someday . " " Oh , really ? " The lieutenant turned again to look at the MiG killer . The captain sipped his drink . He remembered the day Jefferson had been shot down . He 'd never forget it : May 10 . Last year . The strike was one of the biggest of the war , and losses were high , but the buzz that night at the bars was about Jefferson because he was one of only a few fighter pilots who had gained celebrity status in Vietnam . Word had it that the F-4 Phantom pilot had ejected right over the target he had just bombed . No one expected that he would ever make it back . Not ever . " I 'll be damned , " the captain said again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russ Jefferson . " (
