On Sept. 11 our new world was a small town with a huge Main Street where everyone suddenly knew everyone else , wore the same colors , felt like kin . It 's hard to imagine we could have huddled comfortably in such close quarters for very long . <P> A country founded by rebels and settled by refugees is a happily untidy place , slow to conform , quick to adjust . Another week passes , another adjustment : first came permission to laugh again , make fun of the President , shop ; now comes the license to argue again  --  the " music of democracy , " one House member mused last week . It was almost a relief to watch lawmakers who used to loathe one another make common cause in their loathing of John Ashcroft 's antiterrorism bill . Did anyone actually mourn the death of bipartisanship ? It was a bloodless phantom anyway : all lawmakers love their country and would do anything to defend it , and that includes doing their jobs , which is to disagree over how best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to try to understand the enemies ' motives , or whether the effort reeks of apology and appeasement . New Yorkers argue over whether to rebuild the Twin Towers and whether to let Rudy be Mayor for Life . Minnesotans argue whether it 's appropriate for state workers to strike during wartime . <P> The public arm wrestling is oddly consoling . No one argued about much of anything on Sept. 11 ; we were truly united , in shock and grief , and lingered there a while , finding safety in numbers . But it was disturbing to watch censors enforce intellectual curfews and hear of fights over the proper way to display an American flag . If people feel safe enough to argue in public again , maybe things really are moving back to normal . <P> It was getting awkward , holding hands all the time . We each move through all this rubble at our own pace , and it 's not fair to hold others back or drag them along faster than their balance allows . People confess that they have stopped returning phone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation is getting too raw between those who believe the world has changed forever and those who may agree but still want to move on . You 're wallowing in misery . No , you 're in denial . But I ca n't sleep . I do n't want to talk about it anymore . A Chicago psychotherapist goes to church in search of calm and respite . " I had to listen to 100 different versions of how horrendous an event this was , " he says . " I did n't want to hear any more pain , to have more emotions thrown at me . The pastor felt that he needed to talk about whether people are being too patriotic and too gung-ho . That 's fine . But that was not what I went there for . "
