HOT READ // Now that the league has decided that the Saints will play only three of their 16 games at " home "  - -  in San Antonio , where the team is living and practicing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina -- how will the displacement affect their season ? " It 'll be interesting to see if that emotion ends up lifting us up or tearing us down , " G.M. Mickey Loomis said last week . " This ca n't be an albatross on our shoulders . It 's got to be a leprechaun . " Maybe it 's a good thing the Saints will be frequent fliers : Under Jim Haslett , they 're 25-17 away from home ( including Monday 's 27-10 loss to the Giants ) , 18-22 in the Superdome . What Haslett will sell to running back Deuce McAllister ( above ) and the rest of his players is the role they can play in keeping the nation 's eyes on the battered Gulf Coast . " You remember the tsunami ? Two weeks of big news , then forgotten , " Haslett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but people moved on . I feel it 's our obligation to the entire region to win , to keep the attention focused on the relief efforts in Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama . That 's why we ca n't focus on where the games are . Just play ' em . And win . " // HEAD TO HEAD // Eli Manning versus the Chargers // There 's only one reason a Giants-Chargers game will be on national television on Sunday night : Manning 's rejection of the Chargers . Before the 2004 draft , in which San Diego had the first pick , Manning ( left ) announced that would not play for the organization . The Chargers took him at his word : They selected him , then dealt him to the Giants . If NFL history is a guide , the kid better wear earplugs when he takes the field at Qualcomm . In 1983 , after John Elway forced a trade from Baltimore to Denver under similar circumstances , Elway started the second game of his career at Baltimore . " The reception was brutal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' G.M. " I do n't know if I 've ever seen anything like it . We sold out the game . It was hot , noisy and really rough on him . " Elway got yanked with the score tied 3-3 , and Steve DeBerg stepped in to throw two touchdown passes in a 17-10 Denver win . // THREE POINTS // 1 . Most impressive emerging defensive lineman : Colts tackle Larry Tripplett , a powerful and quick slasher . He 's Warren Sapp from five years ago . // 2 . I do n't think I 've ever seen a team display as much negativity toward its quarterback as the dispirited Lions showed Joey Harrington late in his five-interception debacle in Chicago . I ca n't see Harrington making it in Detroit . // 3 . Has a team with such great expectations ever been as stunningly awful as the Vikings ? Even so , Minnesota would have to be three times worse for coach Mike Tice ( above ) to get fired , because there 's not a logical person on his coaching staff -- not even the once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense -- to serve as interim coach . // Peter King 's Monday Morning Quarterback , every week at SI.com/football.
