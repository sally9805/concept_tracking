Section : The Tip Sheet MONEY <p> FUNNY HOW CONGRESS keeps ranting about the need to streamline the income-tax code . Yet whenever legislators hunker down in the back rooms with lobbyists , they make things worse . Every interest group expects a special indulgence . Every congressman brags to voters about the clever new tax cuts passed . Last month a tax-reform panel proposed a raft of good ideas for simplifying returns , but do n't hold your breath . Cleaning up subclauses in the tax code always takes someone 's favorite deduction away , and this Congress is n't interested . <p> The good news ( if there can be such a thing ) is that not much is new for individuals this year . You 'll find just a few bennies on your return , besides the usual increases in the indexed deductions and exemptions . The bad news is that you 're probably missing some write-offs and credits you deserve , because so much has changed in the recent past . Several big , fat tax savers are just sitting there , waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW FOR 2005 <p> <p> Inflation-adjusted increases . The personal exemption rises to $3,200 this year , up $100 from last year . The standard deduction goes to $10,000 for couples filing jointly ( up $300 ) , $7,300 for heads of household ( up $150 ) and $5,000 for singles ( also up $150 ) . <p> If you always take the standard deduction , there might be a better way , says financial planner Dave Ragan at Grunden Financial Advisory in Denton , Texas . Pay two years ' worth of property taxes in a single year  --  by mailing your 2005 taxes in January and your 2006 taxes next December , assuming that there 's no penalty . The double payment will probably give you enough to itemize next year . You could double up on your charitable contributions , too . <p> Ragan suggested that strategy to clients Ron Aparo and Patricia Foster , both 59 . On a calendar-year basis , they did n't have enough deductions to make itemizing worthwhile  --  mainly because their home is paid off ( no mortgage interest , what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a single year , they 'll exceed the standard-deduction limit by $3,526 , saving $574 in taxes in the 15 percent bracket . In 2007 , they 'll go back to the standard deduction . In 2008 , they 'll double up and itemize again . <p> Bigger tax breaks for serious savers . If you 're saving the maximum in your retirement plan , you can now put even more away . The new ceilings : 1 . For Individual Retirement Accounts . You can save , and tax-deduct , as much as $4,000 , plus an extra $500 if you 're 50 or older . That 's $1,000 more than you were allowed to put away last year . Couples can save up to $8,000 ( or $9,000 , if you 're both older ) . In 2006 , the saving cap rises to $5,000 per person , plus $1,000 for those 50 and up . In 2003 ( the latest data available ) , roughly 13 percent of IRA holders had put the maximum away . 2 . Employee retirement plans , such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra $4,000 for those 50 and up . Next year those limits rise to $15,000 plus $5,000 . That 's in addition to whatever your employer contributes to your plan . The self-employed , with Keoghs and SEP-IRAs , can save as much as $42,000 this year and $44,000 next year . <p> You say you ca n't afford to save ? Sorry , anybody can , if it 's top priority . Take Betsy Hyde , 56 , of Oklahoma City , who earns about $40,000 a year in a hospital marketing job . Her house and used Toyota Camry are paid for . This year she socked away 30 percent of her salary in her 403(b) and $4,000 in an IRA . In January , she 'll increase her IRA savings to the new $5,000 limit . " I want to enjoy my retirement and not be a burden on my children , " she says . Hyde 's planner , David Bize , likes her prompt 2006 IRA contribution . She picks up a full year of tax-deferred earnings , compared with people who contribute late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people affected by Hurricane Katrina  --  both victims and rescuers . The write-offs go only to people in the official disaster areas , and do n't include victims of Hurricane Rita or other blows . All the details on how to claim these deductions have n't been published yet . To follow them , and find out which counties are covered , go to irs.gov or call the IRS at 866-562-5227 . The tax breaks include : 1 . Bigger deductions for casualty losses . If Katrina damaged your property , you can deduct the entire , uninsured loss on your tax return . For any other disaster , you have to reduce your casualty loss by $100 plus 10 percent of your adjusted gross income . <p> Kenny Taylor , 48 , of New Orleans , who sells insurance for Allstate , was one of the last in his neighborhood to evacuate . He grabbed his family , dog and checkbooks and headed for relatives in Lafayette , La . The next time he stepped into his Victorian home , most of the ground floor was underwater , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His nearby office was underwater , too . Ironically , Taylor did n't have enough flood insurance to cover the contents of his home , and none at all for the contents of his business . At a hurricane-relief center , an IRS representative explained that he could take his casualty loss against last year 's higher income by filing an amended 2004 return . " Really helpful , " Taylor says . There 's just one rub : the size of your deductible loss depends on the predisaster value of your property , and what can you prove when your records are gone ? The IRS has n't answered that yet . 2 . Three breaks for victims who had to pull money out of their retirement accounts . You can take up to $100,000 without owing the 10 percent penalty on withdrawals prior to age 59i . You 'll have to pay income taxes on the money , but can spread the payments over three years . Normally , you ca n't put money back into a retirement account once you 've taken it out . But Katrina victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole again . 3 . An OK to file certain tax forms late . This applies to people whose records were damaged in Hurricanes Katrina , Rita and Wilma . For details , see the IRS Web site . 4 . A tax break for good Samaritans who took in homeless Katrina victims for at least 60 days . You can take an extra $500 exemption for each of your guests , up to a maximum of $2,000 . ( You 'll need their Social Security numbers to make your claim . ) <p> Linda Sullivan , 55 , who lives in Baton Rouge , La. , has a long history of taking in hurricane strays  --  usually friends from coastal towns . " The first night was kind of a fun outing , " she says . But then the influx of newly homeless people turned Baton Rouge into a nightmare town , she says . " They were stopping you all the time , to see if you knew somewhere they could stay . " Evacuees , including strangers , have been rotating through Sullivan 's rooms . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only one friend stayed for the full two months , she says , so she 'll get $500 . DECISIONS , DECISIONS <p> The trickiest tax deductions are those that balance one write-off against another . Here are three that you might come up against : <p> 1 . Which tax break is the best for child-care expenses ? You can take a tax credit on your return if your child is younger than 13 and you work for pay ( or go to school full-time ) . The amount depends on your income and how many young children you have . For one child , it ranges from $1,050 for low-income parents to $600 for those earning more than $43,000 . <p> But there may be a better alternative . Many employers let you put money into a tax-free " flexible spending account , " using payroll deduction . You use that money to help cover child- care costs . If you 're eligible for both tax breaks , here 's how to choose , says tax attorney Donna LeValley , of J.K. Lasser 's annual guide , " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modest income taxed at 15 percent . Use the flexible-spending account if you 're in the 25 percent bracket and higher . It will generally net you more . <p> Andrea Price , 38 , a manager at the publisher John Wiley &; Sons , has been taking a $600 child-care credit since her son was born two years ago . She 'd never heard of the flexible-spending option , or that Wiley offered it . " I may have gotten materials about it and not understood it , " she says . This year she 'll switch . Her tax saving should exceed $1,000 , LeValley says . <p> If your company offers this tax break , you normally have to sign up before the year-end so that money can start coming out of your paycheck on the first of the year . You can also use it to help with the cost of caring for a disabled spouse or aging parent who lives with you . <p> 2 . Which should you deduct on your return , sales taxes or state income taxes ? You can take one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales tax , of course , in the eight states that do n't tax wage income ( Alaska , Florida , Nevada , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas , Washington and Wyoming ) . But you have to know how . Jenny Muscarella , 33 , of Frisco , Texas , did n't take the deduction last year because she had n't kept her sales-tax receipts . Later , she discovered that she did n't need them . The IRS gives you a table for acceptable deductions , to which you can add taxes paid on the purchase of homes , cars , planes and boats . The tax table is mailed to people who usually itemize returns , or look for it in Publication 600 , at irs.gov . An accountant helped Muscarella amend her 2004 returns ; she got an extra $830 write-off . <p> The sales-tax deduction might be an option in other states if you find that you wo n't owe much in state income taxes . It expires this year , unless Congress extends it . <p> 3 . When do you get the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have one on order , try to take delivery in 2006 . This year you can take a $2,000 deduction to help defray the cost . But next year you get a new tax credit that should be worth much more . The credit will vary by vehicle . According to estimates by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy , the 2006 write-off will reach $3,150 for the Toyota Prius and less for other hybrids ( for the list , posted in August , go to aceee.org/transportation ) . <p> Financial planner Holly Hunter , 50 , and her husband , photographer Dan Gair , 48 , of Portsmouth , N.H. , were thinking about trading their SUV for a hybrid 2006 Ford Escape . Its tax credit is expected to come to $1,950 . But after doing the numbers , they backed off . With gasoline at $2 a gallon , they figured it would take four and a half years to cover the hybrid 's extra cost , and after eight years , she says , a new battery could cost them $10,000 . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green costs more , " Hunter says . " It gives you pause . " <p> Next year you 'll get an additional credit of up to $500 for making your home more energy-efficient , adding insulation , installing a heat pump or upgrading your furnace or water heater . If you 're working on such a project now , try not to complete it until January so you 'll get the tax break , says Mark Luscombe of CCH , a tax-information company . <p> Personally , however , I 'd give up these gimmicks in a heartbeat in return for a simpler tax code . Dream on , Jane . In real life , gimmicks buy the vote . Does your company offer a flexible spending account for child-care costs ? <p> Be sure to ask . It 's often a bigger tax saver than taking the child-care credit on your tax return . You 'll need to sign up before the year-end . How big a casualty loss can you deduct on your tax return ? <p> Katrina victims can deduct all their un-insured losses . Everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When do you get the best tax break for buying a gas-saving hybrid car ? <p> There 's a big tax credit coming if you buy next year . But the car may cost you more than you 'll save in gas  --  so you got ta be green at heart . What 's your reward for being a good Samaritan after Katrina raged ? <p> A tax exemption worth up to $2,000 , for sheltering newly homeless people under your roof ( but you need their Social Security numbers ! ) . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : NEW MATH : Price weighs tax options for child care <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : BIG LOSS : Taylor was devastated <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : GAS UP : Gair and Hunter car-shop <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : SHELTER : Sullivan and her full house <p> By Jane Bryant Quinn <p> With : Catharine Skipp , Miami and Karen Springen , Chicago ; Reporter Associate : Temma Ehrenfeld <p> Correction <p> IN " GIVE ME A ( TAX ) BREAK !
