I wanted him to hear it before he went . ? Marley , ? I said , ? You are a great dog. ? " // - John Grogan , Marley and Me // How do you know that your dog is unstable ? If you are like the majority of my clients , you just know . Your dog gets aggressive with other dogs on walks and at the dog parks . Or howls for hours when you leave the house . Or compulsively runs away . All this is puzzling to you , because the family dog from your childhood was perfect  --  or that is the way that you remember him . In the amber glow of your memory , your beloved Blackie was mellow , obedient , and content to stay in the background . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dogs . He fetched and returned the tennis ball , walked beside you to school , and never peed in the house . So why does your current dog dig up your garden ? Why does he hide under the table when the garbage truck drives by ? What in the world is up with him when he manically spins in circles when he gets excited ? Of course , like most of my clients with unstable dogs , you simply accept that your dog was born with something missing  --  or has some sort of mental disorder . Or , if your dog was adopted from a rescue organization , you create a story  --  that he had such a traumatic experience in his past placements that he will never be able to forget the terrible abuse he suffered during those dark , lonely years before he met you . So of course , he will never be stable , and you should not complain , but instead , remain tolerant and feel really sorry for him when he pees all over your sofa whenever you turn the television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who comes near his food dish , knowing what he ? s been through in his short but traumatic life ? You decide you have to pay the price to live with an unstable dog , because of everything that happened to him before . You owe it to him . // They ? re All Great Dogs // The truth about dogs is , they don ? t feel bad about the past . They don ? t dwell on their bad memories . We are the only species that does that . Dogs live in the moment . If they feel safe and secure in the moment , then any past conditioned behavior can be reconditioned , provided we give our time , our patience  --  and our consistency . Dogs move on  --  often , very quickly . They  --  like everything else of Mother Nature  --  naturally want to return to balance . Too often , it is we , the humans , who are unknowingly preventing that balance from occurring . // We are human beings and one of the most beautiful things about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including an animal  --  who we care about is in distress , we feel bad for them . We hurt when they hurt . But in the animal world , hurt is a weak energy . Feeling sorry is a weak energy . The kindest thing we can do for our animals who have suffered in the past is to help them move forward into the present . In short , that uncontrollable , neurotic monster you are living with is just waiting for you to help guide him on the way to becoming one of the world ? s greatest dogs ! // Marley &amp; Me // John Grogan ? s book Marley &amp; Me : Life and Love with the World ? s Worst D o g hit the best-seller list in November of 2005 and , as of this writing , is still in the top ten . It ? s easy to see why  --  this fun-to-read , touching tale of a lovable but out-of-control family Labrador , Marley , could easily be the life story of many of my clients dogs . Marley is usually destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ? s even described on the book jacket as wondrously neurotic . To me , joining the words wondrous and neurotic is part of the reason that there are so many unstable dogs in America . Many people who love their dogs think that their pets ? unhealthy issues are just " personality quirks . " When author Grogan first published his tribute to the recently deceased Marley in the Philadelphia Inquirer , he initially thought that his former companion was one-of-a-kind - " the world ? s worst dog . " He was soon flooded with letters and e-mails informing him that he was actually just one member of a giant " Bad Dog Club . " // " My in-box resembled a television talk show , " Grogan writes , ? Bad Dogs and the People Who Love Them , ? with the willing victims lining up to proudly brag not about how wonderful their dogs were but about just how awful . " Like many of my clients , however , all these well-meaning dog lovers may not understand that their dog isn ? t happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year when the wonderful Grogan family actually became my clients . Through my National Geographic channel series , Dog Whisperer , they contacted me and invited me to their home in Pennsylvania to help them with Gracie , their current dog . Also a gorgeous yellow lab , Gracie had a very different issue than Marley ( which I ? ll get to chapter 4 ) . But as different as the two dogs were , Gracie and Marley ? s problems were both caused by the same human issues  --  lack of leadership . When I finally met John Grogan and his wife , Jenny , Marley ? s story made more sense to me . They are highly intelligent , compassionate people who see the world through the eyes of talented journalists . They observe , analyze , and describe , but they don ? t interfere or try to change . They assumed they were stuck with Marley the way he was  --  that , in the words of John ? s father , Marley just " had a screw loose . " Indeed , as the Grogans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for Marley ? s quirks , there wouldn ? t have been a wonderful book for so many people to identify with , and to bring tears to so many people ? s eyes . That ? s the catch , isn ? t it ? We don ? t want to change our dogs because they make us laugh , or feel unconditionally loved , or needed . But very often we don ? t put ourselves into the position of how the dog feels . When a dog has a fear , or an obsession , or any of the many other problems I am called in to solve , most of the time we ? re not talking about a " personality quirk . " We ? re talking about an unfulfilled and sometimes an unhappy dog . // After I finished wiping the tears in my eyes and put down Grogan ? s book , the first thing that came to my mind was that Marley was perfectly capable of being that " great dog , " all the time ! In the book , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of their second son and , overwhelmed with the frustration of caring for two babies and a dog that destroys furniture on a daily basis , she finally breaks down and orders the uncontrollable lab out of the house for good . Previously , Marley had been kicked out of obedience class , but John knows that if he can ? t get the dog to follow some basic commands and learn not to jump up on people who come to the house this time around , he ? s going to lose his best friend . So John actually did it . With grim determination , John buckled down , worked really hard to become a serious " pack leader , " and finally helped Marley to graduate from obedience class at last  --  even though he was seventh in an obedience class with eight dogs in it . With the help of a friend , John breaks Marley of his habit of tackling people who come to their front door . The point is , John was a pack leader when he absolutely needed to be  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Together the two of them rallied to the challenge and did what needed to be done in order to keep the pack together . In my reading of the book , however , once Jenny recovered from her depression and things mellowed out at home , John stopped following through in his leadership . So Marley only went so far in learning how to obey household rules , boundaries , and limitations . // John and Jenny also had an advantage that many people who adopt older dogs or shelter dogs don ? t have  --  the opportunity to condition Marley to be a well-behaved dog from puppyhood . Again , seeing their dog as journalists  --  in a detached way  --  they failed to interfere with what they assumed was Marley ? s natural development . They observed all his antics with wonder and good humor . Plus , he was so darn cute ! The endearing photograph on the cover of the book says it all  --  the curiously cocked head , the pleading brown eyes , how could anyone with a heart ever want to correct or give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny made the well-meaning but common mistake of believing that Marley ? s destructive antics as a puppy were evidence of his developing personality , his " spirit . " When you study dogs in nature  --  from wolves to wild dogs to domestic dogs that raise each other , like some farm dogs do  --  you will witness discipline and order instilled in their lives from their very first days as puppies . You ? ll also see the elder canids putting up with an awful lot from the pups  --  instead will allow the little ones to crawl on them , tug on them , even nip . They won ? t deny their innate playfulness , however they set definite limits on it . When playtime is over , the elder dog lets the pups know it right away  --  by nosing them to the ground with a gentle bite or lifting them up by their scruffs , if necessary . Sometimes , only a growl will get their point across . The older dog always follows through and the pups always back off . If danger is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herded together and inside the safety of the den in the blink of an eye  --  to the envy of any kindergarten teacher out there who daily tries to get a pack of five-year-old kids to come back into class from the playground ! The point is , the pups get the message very , very quickly that they must follow the rules of the pack . At no point in time is their playful " spirit " ever diminished , but they do come to understand early on in life that there is a time and a place for everything . Mother Nature has no trouble setting limits in a firm but loving way . But when it comes to cute puppies ( and often , our own cute kids ) , most people just can ? t bear to set them on the road to good behavior  --  especially when their antics provide such memorably humorous moments . But when those pups reach 100 pounds , the fun and games that used to seem cute suddenly become destructive and sometimes dangerous . // John and Jenny had a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loyalty with him . What they didn ? t accomplish was respect , however , and respect is an essential ingredient in the structure of any healthy pack . When the students don ? t respect the teacher , a school class doesn ? t learn . A military unit can not function at its best when the soldiers do not respect their commander . Parents can not properly guide their children if the kids do not respect them . In the same way , your dog will not feel safe and calm and stable if she does not respect you as pack leader . // Part of the reason John and Jenny did not gain Marley ? s full respect was that they always addressed themselves to Marley - the name and personality , first . Marley to them was just plain old , goofy , **30;518;TOOLONG , loyal Marley . They were not addressing themselves to the animal in Marley , the dog in Marley , or even the breed of Marley , a Labrador retriever . // Remember this key concept : // When you interact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to correct out-of-control behavior  --  you must train your mind to relate to him in this order : // Animal // Species : dog ( canis familiaris ) // Breed ( Labrador Retriever ) // Name ( Marley ) // First , it ? s important to address yourself to the " animal " in your dog because that is // what you have in common with him  --  you are both animals . We ? ll talk later about how to project the kind of small furry person with a tail . All dogs have certain traits in common and certain ingrained ways of behaving . Learning to recognize what is " dog " and what is " Marley " is the key in distinguishing unstable behavior from normal behavior . Then there ? s breed . Recognizing breed is especially important if , like the Grogans , you have a purebred animal . The genes that make him " pure " also give him special needs that you must know how to fulfill in order to ensure his happiness and balance . We ? ll talk more about fulfilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal and dog , finally , there ? s Marley  --  the name , the irrepressible " personality . " Most of the time , what we think of as a dog ? s personality is in our own heads , the story we made up about the dog . Often it ? s based on how the dog looks or acts , and I ? m sorry to say that , far too often , what we think of as personality is actually based on the dog ? s own issues of instability . // So , how do you tell your dogs ? " personality " from your dogs ? " issues " ? What are " issues , " anyway ? // ISSUES : // Aggression : Directed toward other dogs and/or people . Includes fear-biting , growling over food , lunging at strangers or strange dogs , aggressive possessiveness . // Hyperactive Energy : Includes jumping on people upon meeting them or when they enter the house ; compulsively spinning or twitching , destructive activity such as chewing and digging ; overexcited panting , etc . Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Includes barking , whining , scratching , etc.  --  whether you are there or after you leave the house ; pacing ; destroying things when you ? re away . // Obsessions/Fixations : Includes an " addiction " or unusual preoccupation with anything from a cat to a tennis ball ; expressed by tense body language , obliviousness to owner ? s commands , food rewards , even physical pain . // Phobias : A fear or traumatic incident that the dog has not been able to move beyond  --  anything from shiny floors to thunder to the UPS truck . // Low Self-esteem/Timidity : Weak energy , irrational fear of anything ; total freezing up . An extreme degree of fear . // Any kind of behavior that falls into these categories is not " just your dog ? s personality . " It is a problem . // It ? s important to remember that each of the issues described above can have a medical component . A disease or parasite can cause your dog to act unstable , as can an inborn neurological disorder . In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very small percentage  --  maybe one percent - of all dogs with behavior problems . It ? s important however to always have your dog checked out on a regular basis by a vet , especially if there is a sudden behavior change . Chances are , using the leadership methods I describe in my teachings will help rehabilitate your dog  --  but make sure you get a medical opinion first , just in case there is a health issue . I have several wonderful vets with whom I work , and I like to think medicine and behavioral therapy can go hand in hand in creating a world full of healthy , happy dogs . // Personality versus Issues // What characteristics actually comprise your dog ? s natural " spirit , " or " personality " ? First of all , you must understand that " personality " has a different meaning to a dog than it does to you . If you are a human who would like to date a person who complements your personality , you will place a personal ad and say things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go hiking , enjoy romantic sunset jogs on the beach ; I like action movies "  --  indicating that you are an active-type , high-energy person and you are looking for someone to match your energy . If you place an ad that says , " I like drinking hot chocolate by a fire , staying in and renting videos , and doing crossword puzzles , " you are indicating that you are a lower-energy person who wants to meet someone with a similar energy . You would describe yourself or another person as laid back , or high-strung , or shy or outgoing . As a human , you regard all these things as personality . // Personality is similar in a dog ? s world , but it is not expressed in words , or in likes and dislikes , but rather by scent and energy . When two dogs in my pack make friends with each other , they will first use their noses to sniff each other ? s genitals , which will give them all kinds of information about the sex , energy level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog has been , and so on . The energy level is important because the dog will get along best with another dog whose energy is compatible . Have you ever seen two dogs playing , where the energy level is not a good fit ? This happens often with an older dog who is with puppies . The older dog has naturally less energy , even if he was a higher-energy dog in his youth . The puppy almost always has a higher energy . The puppy will be driving the older dog crazy wanting to play , when the older dog just wants to chill out . This happens to a different degree with the dogs in my pack : the dogs naturally seek out as " friends " the dogs who can match their level of play . Even though all the dogs in the pack get along , certain dogs will gravitate to certain other dogs based on their energy levels and how they like to play . A great example of this kind of attraction happened when I was working with Punkin , a Rhodesian Ridgeback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal was to bring him to the center to learn from the pack ? s role models  --  balanced dogs who couldn ? t care less about rocks , but who have learned to play with tennis balls in a disciplined way ( meaning play always has a beginning and an end , as determined by me , the pack leader ) . Punkin was an anxious , high-energy-type dog , and when we got to the dog park , he immediately was drawn to LaFitte , a very large , very high-energy standard poodle . It was like the stereotype of the " two eyes meeting across a crowded room . " They instantly recognized in each other ? s scent and energy that they would match each other ? s level of play and have a great time romping together . Recently , I had a high-energy Jack Russell named Jack staying at my center , whose favorite play-friend was a huge but medium energy pit bull named Spike . Even though Jack was half Spike ? s size , the two just meshed together perfectly . Scent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " personality . " // As humans , we naturally strive to create symbols and put names on things , and we tend to associate personality with names . As far as current science knows , we are the only species that started describing our world with symbols , artwork , and most of all , with labels and names . Today , we Homo sapiens have millions of different languages and symbols that we use to communicate with each other . Just look around you  --  we have the little man and woman on restroom signs ; the no smoking logo ; even the American flag , to tell us where we are and how we should be relating to our environment at that moment . We have millions of different words and phrase combinations to describe things . As people , we tend to organize and personalize pretty much everything that happens around us . It ? s how we understand things , how we see the world through our human eyes . For example , we give hurricanes names . We classify flowers and trees . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have names . They have a scent , and they have a specific use for the dog in its environment . Is this tree poison or will eating the bark of this tree make my stomach feel better ? Is this tree at a crossroads so I can mark it with my scent ? they think . This how a dog views the tree - from the point of view of her survival , . Dogs don ? t need names to understand and identify each other , either . They look at the big picture  --  their own survival and the survival of the group . Your personality  --  your " name " to your dog  --  is how you fit in his life ; your energy , your scent , your role in the pack is what is important . // Dogs don ? t have a name within the pack ; they have a position within the pack . Some people who study dogs would name the ranks , " alpha , beta , omega , " and so forth . Other labels that we create would define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and number four . Many people misunderstand me and say that I ? m looking at dogs simplistically , as if it ? s all about dominance . What they fail to realize is I believe that all the dogs are important within the pack . Dominance doesn ? t mean the alpha dog is better than the others . In charge , yes ; better , no . Every dog serves a purpose within the pack . The one in the back is the most sensitive of all ; he ? s often the one that keeps everybody aware of possible intruders . The one in the front  --  the pack leader - makes sure everybody gets fed , finds food and water , and is defended from rivals or other predators . It ? s not a democracy , but it ? s definitely all about the whole being better than the sum of all the parts . It ? s all about the " we . " // " Me versus You " / " I-I " versus " We " // Humans  --  at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very " me versus you " context . Especially in America , where rugged individualism is typical , the almighty I is the center of the universe . To my mind , that ? s what makes our interpersonal difficulties so common . Divorce rates are higher than 50 percent ; kids rebel against their parents , people fight with their bosses and quit their jobs in anger  --  because at the heart of our relationships , it ? s almost always me against you . Quite differently , if a dog could have an inner voice expressed in words , he would be thinking of his world in terms of " we , " all the time . Pack first , individuals later . Even the pack leader thinks this way . Perhaps that ? s partly why so many of us insecure humans gravitate to dogs when we have difficulties with people . When a dog comes into your home , you instantly get a " we "  --  and that never changes . It ? s just in the nature of the dog , and it is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraught with tension . // This is not to say that every dog isn ? t an individual  --  of course he is ! But how do you distinguish what is your dog ? s true uniqueness from what may or may not be his " issues " ? There are certain characteristics that vary from one dog to another , which become how we humans usually gauge our dogs ? " personalities . " Every dog is curious to a degree - that ? s a part of a dog ? s spirit . Every dog is joyful to a degree  --  dogs live in the moment and every day for them is a kind of Christmas morning , even if they are a lower-energy or older dog . Every dog is playful to a degree . How he likes to play is partly determined by the breed , and partly by the energy . Every dog is loyal to a degree - because in nature , the pack needs loyalty in order to stay together and survive . Every dog knows how to learn  --  that ? s part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be challenged . Every dog knows how to follow a leader ? s directions and rules and understands the importance of such rules . Every dog is affectionate to some degree . Every dog likes and needs to walk with a pack leader in migration mode  --  how much , again , depends partly on breed and partly on energy . Every dog needs to be useful , to work for food and water  --  to be a helpful , productive member of your pack . Dogs are not solitary like many species of cats  --  they are social carnivores and their deep social needs are hardwired into their brains . Being social means they need the pack to be happy and fulfilled . Because we have domesticated dogs , we have become their default pack members throughout our long history together . If we were not around , they would still form packs . During the Katrina crisis , some of the dogs left behind did exactly that temporarily , in order to survive . But we ? ve been " pack leaders " to them and/or their ancestors for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hundreds of thousands - of years , so although they absolutely realize that we are not dogs but humans , they will naturally follow us if we provide them with the correct direction . // Exercise // Below you ? ll find two columns with single adjectives . One describes a normal dog ? s characteristics or traits that you might define as a dog ? s true " personality " ; the other describes traits that are more likely to be issues of instability . It is a very general list , of course , as many of these traits vary depending on the breed , but I think it ? s a good overview for assessment . Read the list and note the adjectives that you would apply to your dog at least 75 percent of the time . Then make an honest assessment of what you and your dog need to work on . // Normal Dog Traits or Personality // Active // Playful // Responsive to general commands and signals // Eager to join in " pack " ( family ) activities // Sometimes cautious // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Curious // Happy-go-lucky // Alert // Exploratory // Patient  --  practices waiting // Responsive to food // Affectionate // Dog Issues or Instability // Hyperactive // Jumps on people // Disobedient  --  doesn ? t come when called // Runs away // Overly fearful  --  fear of biting , barking or peeing ; shies away from people , animals , or objects . // Obsessive barking // Antisocial  --  " doesn ? t like " dogs or humans // Aggressive or predatory // Overly territorial // Possessive of toys , food , furniture // Obsessive over object or activity ( compulsive retrieving ; chewing ; tail chasing ) // Shrinks from touch // Once again , the news is good  --  in 99 percent of the cases I ? ve dealt with , all of the above issues can be resolved with my three-part fulfillment formula for any dog : // Exercise ( the walk ) // Discipline ( rules , boundaries and limitations ) // Affection // in that order ! // When you provide these things for your dog , you are taking a positive step toward becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding the importance of remaining calm and assertive and remembering not to " punch out " on your responsibilities for your dog any more than you would punch out on your children . I ? ve heard children described as " little cameras that never turn off "  --  and dogs are exactly the same way . Living in the universe of the " we , " they are always observing you and processing your signals for clues to how to behave . When we send dogs inconsistent signals , we create instability in them . // Once again , we ? re back to the part of the fulfillment formula that many of us have a problem with - discipline . Discipline isn ? t about showing a dog who ? s boss ; it ? s about taking responsibility for a living creature you have brought into your world . Many of my clients think that if they set any boundaries for their dogs , they automatically become the bad guy . That ? s certainly the problem John and Jenny Grogan had . Without discipline , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , boundaries , and limitations he needed in order to live a more peaceful life . He ended up full of what they saw as " personality quirks " but what I would call instability . By giving a dog rules , boundaries , and limitations , you don ? t kill his spirit . You just give him the structure he needs in his life in order to find peace  --  and allow his true dog self to emerge . Your dog can be that " great dog " you imagine  --  but you ? ve got to be the one to lead him there ! // Be The Pack Leader Success Story // Tina Madden and Nunu // If you ? ve watched the first season of my show , you probably remember Nunu the Demon Chihuahua , whose pint-sized aggression was making the lives of his owner Tina and her roommate Barkely unmanageable . Three years later , Tina Madden ? s life has changed dramatically since she became the Pack Leader . Now she not only works at my Dog Psychology Center , but she rehabilitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she feels about herself  --  empowered as a woman and a person . Here ? s her story in her own words : // " Before Nunu , I was extremely insecure . I didn ? t leave the house very much . I had issues with myself , my body image , what people thought of me , how they viewed me . I was always insecure and anxious . I cried all the time . Anyway , I decided I ? d rather be around dogs than people , so I quit my bartending job and went to work as a vet tech . // I was okay at work because the animals needed me . But outside of the work environment , I was afraid of the world . Even going to the grocery store scared me . I was isolating myself , and it was just getting worse . This kept going in a downward spiral . I wasn ? t rock bottom . But I was heading there . // I got Nunu in February . He comes in . I ? m insecure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and I think , there ? s got to be something I can do . Everybody kept saying , " Put him down . He ? s terrible . He ? s too damaged to ever be a good dog . Just put him to sleep . " And then in April , in walks Cesar , and when he walked out of my house , my life changed that day . It was because he had such " can-do " energy . He wanted me to become more confident and show more leadership  --  something I would have found impossible to imagine before . But his words to me were , " No matter what , you can do this . You just have to do it . " And if I wasn ? t going to do it for me , at least I could do it for my dog , who I loved . // First of all , I immediately had to get over my fear of going out . Cesar absolutely ordered me to walk Nunu every day , and so that ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said an hour . So at least two to two-and-a-half hours a day , before and after work , seven days a week , we ? d be walking . And in my walking , because Nunu ? s so cute , people wanted to approach him , so I began to meet people that way . I started making friends in my neighborhood . Suddenly I had a social life - people were inviting me to their houses . And I had a ritual . Before I would go out on my walk every day , I would visualize . " This is going to be a great walk . This is going to be a perfect walk ! Any obstacle we come across , we can handle . I have the knowledge and the presence to handle it . " I used to walk by dogs behind fences and even face-to-face with dogs , and I would be terrified they were going to bite Nunu . I thought I didn ? t know how to handle it . But little by little , I noticed I did know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the better it became and the more confident I became . // Nunu didn ? t completely change the next day . He wasn ? t all " fixed " the next week , or even the next month , but the more I changed my behavior around him , which meant being more confident , he started to really change . I ? m proud of Nunu for changing  --  but the big energy change came from me . From empowering myself . // My self-confidence has increased so much . And not just around dogs . The way I connect with other people has changed completely . I think one of the hardest things for some people is to be able to read another person . Are they good ? Are they bad ? Can you trust them ? But really , understanding other people begins with understanding yourself . Learning to be aware of my own energy has really made that easier for me ? and that ? s something I learned from Cesar and Nunu . And I don ? t feel like a victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about every situation . // I did " transform my dog , " and then " transform my life . " I am very happy now . . And all because of one little dog . One little one-pound dog . //
