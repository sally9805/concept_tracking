Body composition measurements vary greatly in degree of measurement difficulty and accuracy . Hydrostatic weighing , chemical dilution or their equivalents were the accepted " gold " standards for assessing fat mass . Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) is fast replacing these techniques as the preferred standard . However , these direct measurement techniques require expensive and precise equipment and must be operated by highly trained personnel . For this reason the " Body Mass Index " or " BMI " is being widely used to indicate body composition . The BMI is thought to be reasonably accurate and simply requires body weight and height measurements . Between these two extremes lie the many other approaches and their corresponding algorithms . The discrepancies inherent in these algorithms are discussed . The prediction accuracy of the more popular empirical algorithms is evaluated . These evaluations indicate that a promising approach to body composition measurements is a combination of both BMI and bioelectric impedance measurements . <p> Body composition such as the ratio of fat mass to total body mass can not be measured . However , parameters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parameters are classed as either primary or secondary . Primary parameters are used in analytical algorithms to represent body composition . Secondary parameters are used in empirical algorithms to predict primary parameters . Secondary parameters are needed since primary parameters are difficult to measure . However , prediction errors are inherent in the use of these secondary parameters . This paper evaluates the accuracy of skin fold , body mass index and three bioelectrical secondary algorithms . The bioelectrical algorithms ( presented by Kushner , 1992 , and Thomas , Cornis and Ward , 1992 ) are implemented by the Tanita Corporation . The accuracy of these algorithms is indirectly compared to the well accepted hydrostatic weighing technique ( as first described by Garrow , Stalley , Diethelm et al , 1979 ) . Method <p> In order to establish a common basis of understanding , a model of body composition measurement techniques and terminology is first presented . With this background , the measurement techniques to be evaluated are selected and described . Also , a suitable data base for testing these measurement techniques is developed . Finally , performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A Body Composition Model <p> Figure 1 shows a model of the components of body composition technology . Body composition can be represented in either the volumetric ( plethysmography ) or hydrometric domain . The two domains are equivalent . Equivalency is insured by domain transforms . In both domains there are primary algorithms that operate on primary measurements to represent body composition and there are secondary algorithms that operate on secondary measurements to predict primary measurements . The primary algorithms are well accepted by the industry since they are analytical and use well accepted assumptions for the domain constants . The secondary algorithms are not yet well accepted by the industry . One reason for this lack of acceptance is that the techniques have either been demonstrated to be inaccurate or have not yet been fully evaluated for accuracy . The latter is the case for the body mass index and bioelectric techniques . Inaccuracy is inherent in the secondary algorithms since they must be empirically derived by statistically fitting the secondary parameters to a finite set of measured primary parameters . <p> Primary Algorithms <p> In the volumetric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition is : <p> ( 1 ) f(D) = DfDo / ( Df- D o ) ( D- 1- Do- 1 ) <p> where : D f = Density of body fat , D o = Density of other lean <p> body tissue , D = Composite body density <p> and <p> f(D) = Ratio ( as a function of D ) of body fat mass to total body mass . <p> This algorithm was first reported by ( Siri , 1961 ) . <p> The composite body density , D , is total body weight normalized by body volume . Body volume is usually measured by body displacement techniques using either hydrostatic weighing or , more recently , the " Bod Pod " described by ( Fields , Goran and McCrory , 2002 ) and ( Yee , Fuerst , Salamone et al , 2001 ) . The hydrostatic weighing technique measures water displacement and is based on an application of Archimedes ' principle whereas the Bod Pod measures air displacement and is based on an application of Boyles ' law . More recently , Dual Energy X-ray Adsorptiometry or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being used to directly measure body density . <p> In the hydrometric domain , the de facto standard primary algorithm for representing body composition is : <p> ( 2 ) f(w) = 1 - w/K o <p> where : <p> K o = Ratio of body water mass to total mass of lean body tissue , <p> w = Ratio of body water mass to total body mass and <p> f ( w ) = Ratio ( as a function w ) of body fat mass to total body mass . <p> This technology was first developed by ( Pace and Rathburn , 1945 ) . Pace and Rathburn used the value of K o = 73% however , more recent studies ( by Garrow , 1982 ) indicates that 72% might be more accurate . Body water is usually measured by chemical dilution techniques as described by ( Schoeller , Santen , Peterson et al , 1980 , and Schoeller , Kushner , Taylor et al , 1985 ) . These techniques measure the dilution of heavy water as it passes through the body . <p> In order to insure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that equation 1 equals equation 2 so that for measured values of D the transform of equation 3 applies . i.e. <p> ( 3 ) w = D o / ( D o - Df ) ( 1- D f D- 1 ) Ko <p> In like manner the measured value of D must be such that for measured values of w the inverse transform of equation 4 applies , i.e. <p> ( 4 ) D = D o D f K o / K oo- ( DO- Df ) w <p> It should be noted that the choice of domain parameters D o , D f &; K o must be chosen so that consistency between domains is accomplished ( i.e. equations 3 &; 4 are satisfied ) . From the transform of equations 3 and 4 we see that only one set of domain measurements is needed in order to work in either domain . <p> Secondary Algorithms <p> Secondary algorithms operate on secondary measurements to predict primary parameters . In the volumetric domain these algorithms predict body density . In the hydrometric domain these algorithms predict body water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many ways the effects of body composition can be detected . These algorithms are usually statistically developed by empirically fitting mathematical functions to measured data points of independent , primary and their dependent , secondary parameters . Since the primary parameters are not solely dependent on the measured secondary parameters , other personal data parameters are needed to increase the accuracy of the algorithm . This data is typically age and sex and , in the case of the Tanita algorithms , physical condition . Only the most popular algorithms will be studied . <p> The Skin Fold Algorithms <p> The skin fold algorithms ( such as developed by Jackson and Pollock , 1978 ) are based on the measurement of skin fold as its secondary parameter . For this algorithm skin fold is measured in three locations on the body . These locations are sex dependent as is the algorithm . Also the algorithm is age dependent . Of all the body density algorithms , skin fold is chosen here because of the simplicity of equipment ( calipers ) needed . The Jackson-Pollock algorithm is chosen because it appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( when evaluated by Scherf , Franklin , Lucas et al , 1986 ) <p> The Body Mass Index <p> The " Body Mass Index " or " BMI " has been widely accepted as the standard measure for indicating body composition . It is most conveniently calculated as the ratio of body mass to the square of body height . As such the BMI is a secondary volumetric parameter and not a secondary algorithm . Since body composition parameters have no basis for comparison , the accuracy of the BMI , as such , can not be tested . However , the BMI can be incorporated into a secondary algorithm by performing a least square linear regression of BMI onto the inverse of body density measurements . The representation evaluated in this paper is : <p> ( 5 ) D -1 = 0.864 + 0.00255 BMI for males <p> ( 6 ) D -1 = 0.899 + 0.00243 BMI for females <p> where : BMI is the body mass index in grams per square centimeter . <p> The Tanita Algorithms <p> Tanita has implemented four body composition algorithms into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bioelectric device in that it measures the body impedance between two electrodes applied to the bottom of each foot . Two of the four Tanita algorithms are volumetric and the other two are hydrometric . All four algorithms are functions of body impedance as well as BMI . Both volumetric and hydrometric algorithm pairs consist of 1 ) a " standard " algorithm and 2 ) an " athletic " algorithm . The " standard " algorithm is intended for subjects who , among other things , exercise less than 10 hours a week and have a resting pulse rate of greater than 60 beats/min . The standard algorithm is also a function of age . <p> University of Montevallo Data Base <p> Sixty-one University of Montevallo students were measured using the Jackson-Pollock skin fold technique and three of the four bioelectrical algorithms implemented by Tanita . This population consisted of 16 adult education students ( six male and 10 female ) and 25 male and 20 female kinesiology department students . This data base is shown in Table 1 . The body water , body impedance and body fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TBF 300A . The skin fold measurements were made by Lange skin fold calipers and applied to the Jackson-Pollock skin fold algorithms . The three Tanita algorithms used were the " standard " and " athletic " body fat and the athletic body water algorithms that reside in the model TBF 300A Analyzer . The " std. /athl. " column of table 1 is a combination of the " standard " and " athletic " algorithms . The " standard " algorithm was used for those subjects who do not qualify as " athletic " and the " athletic " algorithm was used for those subjects who do qualify as athletic . All University of Montevallo students listed in table 1 were approved for testing as required by the University of Montevallo . <p> Performance Criteria For Testing Procedures <p> Discrepancies in representing body composition may result from 1 ) measurement inaccuracies , 2 ) inaccurate assumptions or 3 ) prediction errors . Inaccurate assumptions are most often made in using the analytically derived primary algorithms whereas prediction errors will always exist to some degree when using the empirically derived secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicitly assumed that the density and percent water content of lean body tissue is the same from subject to subject . However , these constants will vary somewhat depending on the proportion of muscle mass in lean body tissue ( see Womersley , Durnin , Boddy et al , 1976 ) . These variations have been observed to cause as much as four to five percent variation in percent body fat . Also variation may be caused by aging , racial or ethnic differences . This paper does not evaluate measurement inaccuracies or inaccurate assumptions . It does , however , evaluate prediction errors made by secondary algorithms . <p> Prediction Errors <p> The value of secondary algorithms is judged by the ease of secondary parameter measurement and the prediction accuracy of the algorithm . In this paper prediction accuracy is defined by the accuracy with which the algorithm under test can correctly categorize a subjects ' body composition condition as either excellent , good , fair , poor or very poor . Table 2 shows the " Phoenix Fitness &; Racquet Club " category norms used for this evaluation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categorization . Normally we would use hydrostatic measurements to acquire this knowledge . However , accurate hydrostatic measurements could not be obtained . Therefore , an equivalent replacement was needed . This replacement resulted from correction of the athletic mode of the volumetric , Tanita measurements . Figure 2 shows a statistical comparison of the body fat measurement error for hydrostatic as reported by ( Scherf Franklin , Lucas et as , 1986 ) vs. the Tanita measurements of Table 1 . These errors are referenced to the Jackson-Pollock skin fold measurements . When the Tanita measurements are corrected by consistently subtracting 1.8% , the mean and root mean square ( rms ) error of the corrected Tanita measurements are made equal to the hydrostatic measurements . Thus the corrected Tanita measurements are a likely replacement for hydrostatic weighing . Results <p> Figure 3 shows the errors made in categorizing fat mass condition as either excellent , good , fair , poor or very poor . These errors were counted for the subjects of Table 1 using the norms specified by Table 2 . They were counted for the secondary body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The corrected athletic mode was used as a replacement for hydrostatic weighing for determining the correct categorization . All of the algorithms evaluated , except body water are volumetric algorithms in that they predict body density . The hydrometric body water algorithm evaluated was the Tanita athletic mode algorithm . Discussion <p> Use of fat mass measurements as an indicator of fat mass condition has not been widely accepted . The parameters necessary to represent body fat have either been too difficult to measure or their results can not be trusted . Instead the " body mass index ( BMI ) " has become the standard . Based on the Figure 3 results , it does appear that the skin fold and Tanita standard/athletic techniques are quite inaccurate . The BMI did not fair as well as expected in that only three out of four subjects were categorized correctly . A more accurate approach is to combine BMI with the bioelectric impedance measurements as is done in the Tanita athletic and body water algorithms . More precisely , the Tanita athletic mode algorithm can be corrected as a practical replacement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate volumetric or hydrometric algorithms based on BMI and body impedance measurements can be deployed and easily used to accurately monitor body fat conditions . The techniques employed in this paper can be used to test the prediction accuracy of various body composition algorithms . The error performance definitions along with appropriately simulated data could be used as a basis for design of uniform industry standards . Table 1 University of Montevallo Data Base PREFORMATTED TABLE Table 2 Categories for Body Fat Measurements PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> DIAGRAM : Figure 1 . This is the authors ' concept for classifying the various body composition algorithms studied here . These algorithms are classified as either volumetric ( body volume based ) or hydrometric ( body water based ) . The data inputs to these algorithms are either primary ( ie. uses direct measurements ) or secondary ( ie. uses indirect measurements ) . <p> DIAGRAM : Figure 2 .

The corrected Tanita athletic mode algorithm is derived by subtracting 1.8% from each and every Tanita athletic mode measurement in table 1 . The above comparison shows that the hydrostatic and corrected Tanita algorithm are for all purposes equivalent in their first and second moments . Therefore the corrected Tanita algorithm is a likely replacement for hydrostatic weighing . <p> GRAPH : Figure 3 .
