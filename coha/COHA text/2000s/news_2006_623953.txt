<p> As far back as the second century B.C. , Chinese ships set sail from this storied city on the Pearl River for the far shores of India and Africa , laden with fine Chinese silk . <p> Today , Guangzhou is still a bustling trading center , with mammoth container vessels departing from here and nearby boomtown Shenzhen , loaded with computers , toys , textiles , electronics and cars bound for ports around the world . <p> Also known as Canton , this city of more than 10 million people is the capital and largest city in Guangdong province , China 's leading maker of exported goods and its most powerful magnet for foreign companies . <p> Many such companies are based in California , where the province has forged strong commercial and cultural links , thanks to generations of Chinese immigrants to the Golden State . <p> Lured by tax cuts , cheap land , newly built infrastructure and other incentives , major Bay Area companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. , Intel Corp . and Autodesk Software Co. are active in Guangdong province . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Dublin 's Achievo Corp. , a software and information-technology outsourcer , and Richmond 's MBA Polymers Inc. , a recycler of plastic from junked personal computers . <p> International companies in Guangdong are often led by Chinese Americans whose cultural and linguistic ties to the province make business deals a relatively easy " get . " Guangdong also exercises a powerful appeal for mainland Chinese , who flock to the southeastern coastal province in search of opportunity . <p> As a result , Guangdong is a dynamic polyglot of big-idea entrepreneurs , powerful executives at the helm of major shipping and manufacturing concerns , newly arrived job-seekers from around the country and enterprising foreign expatriates . ( See accompanying profiles on Page J6 . ) <p> Less glamorous and politically important than Beijing or Shanghai , some parts of Guangdong province are more prosperous than either , thanks to radical pro-market reforms introduced here in the late 1970s , before change took root anywhere else in China , which is still nominally communist . <p> Indeed , this swath of the Pearl River Delta area " has been the fastest-growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , " notes a report from Invest Hong Kong , a government agency in Hong Kong , 60 miles from Guangzhou and closely tied to it by commerce . <p> The poetically named Pearl is very much a working river in the modern mode . Giant metal cranes and stacked cargo containers flank the waterway as it nears the South China Sea . Polluted battleship-gray skies over the river in central Guangzhou display the cost of breakneck industrialization . Nevertheless , new companies continue to come ; some are zeroing in on the area 's environmental needs , finding market opportunities there . <p> MBA Polymers , partnering with state-owned Guangzhou Iron &; Steel , recently built a $12.6 million plant on land that used to be covered by banana trees . The plant , opened late last year , is 55 percent owned by MBA Polymers . <p> " If you 're a very large company , you do n't need to have a Chinese partner , " said Richard McCombs , MBA Polymers ' chief financial officer . But for a small company like privately held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner is invaluable , he says . <p> MBA Polymers found its local partner by using Galaxaco China Group LLC , a San Francisco company run by well-connected investment bankers George Sycip and Richard Chong , who scour China for deals , McCombs said . They brought in Guangzhou Iron &; Steel , which wanted to diversify into new technologies . <p> MBA Polymers uses a proprietary technology to break down the hard plastic in discarded PCs so it can be re-molded by other companies and used again in other products . This appeals to Chinese officials , McCombs said , because the fast-developing nation has a huge appetite for plastic , which usually has to be imported . Breaking down the plastic within China allows the Chinese to avoid the costs and delays of importing the plastic they need for manufacturing , and helps to reduce China 's widespread pollution by recycling material that would otherwise be buried in landfills or simply burned . <p> " There are millions of pounds of plastic , " McCombs said . <p> MBA Polymers also operates a busy plant in Richmond , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , he said . Both are cheaper in China , where the new plant employs state-of-the-art technology that is more advanced than anything the company uses in the United States . <p> McCombs acknowledges that doing business in China is not always easy for a U.S. company . Job turnover in booming Guangdong is high , with new enterprises spelling new opportunity . So , new workers often have to be hired and retrained . And local contractors can be unreliable . At MBA Polymers ' new plant in the Nansha Development Zone near Guangzhou , all the electrical work had to be redone because the work was not good enough . <p> Add to that what many China-watchers decry as weak protection of intellectual property , corrupt Communist Party cadres and sometimes confusing contracts , and the challenges of operating in the world 's sixth-largest economy can be daunting . <p> Still , the lure of this dynamic part of China is hard to resist . <p> For one thing , most infrastructure in the Nansha Development Zone at the water 's edge just south of Guangzhou is ultramodern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " made in California " label . The first phase of Guangzhou 's New Baiyun International Airport , which opened in July 2004 and cost $520 million , was built by Parsons Corp. , a Pasadena rival of San Francisco 's Bechtel Corp . <p> Already five times bigger than the city 's old airport , it will grow still larger in the next few years , and may attract U.S. airlines . Certainly , airline interest is there . United Airlines has petitioned the U.S. and Chinese governments for permission to fly nonstop between San Francisco and Guangzhou , and has opened a small sales office in Guangzhou in the hope that permission will be granted . <p> South of the airport , two 35-story office towers are rising in central Guangzhou . They were designed by architect Brian Lee , a partner in the San Francisco office of Skidmore , Owings and Merrill LLP , which is busy in China . The firm has also worked on major projects in Shanghai and in Beijing , where Lee designed a huge , state-owned bank building . <p> " Guangzhou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going through a growth phase now that 's happened in Beijing and Shanghai already . Guangzhou is going to have a new central business district , a new library , a new Shangri-la Hotel , a new convention center . " <p> California companies are not only designing and putting up new buildings , they 're snapping up Chinese companies and opening offices throughout Guangdong province . <p> Achievo Corp . bought Guangzhou 's Jeyo Computer Technology , a small Chinese outsourcing provider , late last year , and has big dreams in China , according to Achievo Chief Executive Officer Robert Lee . " We will grow both organically and through acquisitions , " said Lee , who did n't disclose the price of the Jeyo purchase . <p> Lee , who was born in China and is now a U.S. citizen , is keen on China as an outsourcing locale , saying it 's preferable in many ways to Bangalore and other famed Indian outsourcing centers . <p> " China is a lot closer to the U.S. , time-zone-wise , " he said . " The flights are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker turnover rate in India is very high these days because of their success . " <p> Privately held Achievo , which has been in China for four years and has 80 percent of its 600 employees there , has set up shop in a sprawling new industrial park near Shenzhen , a city of 7 million that sits on the border with Hong Kong . <p> Since its creation in the 1980s at the behest of China 's late leader Deng Xiaoping , Shenzhen has been a manufacturing center and back-office city for Hong Kong , which many foreign companies choose for their regional Asia headquarters to take advantage of Hong Kong 's strong banks , rule of law and business transparency . <p> Although Shenzhen is robustly profit-minded , touches of China 's socialist command and control economy linger . Near Achievo 's Shenzhen digs , recordings of brassy march tunes blare in the morning air , and a billboard admonishes workers to keep busy : " Empty talk endangers the nation . Positive work brings prosperity , " it reads , in Chinese and English . <p> Achievo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DaimlerChrysler , Toshiba and the United Way of Silicon Valley . <p> None of the drawbacks of doing business in China has stopped California companies from jumping into commercial hot spots like Guangdong province , says Guangpei He , a senior manager for Autodesk Software ( China ) Co . San Rafael 's Autodesk claims 90 percent of the China market for architectural and construction software , according to Guangpei , and counts among its clients the Guangzhou Design Institute , which oversees development . The institute uses Autodesk 3-D software in its work and is considering other products from the Bay Area company , he said . <p> All this is consistent with the hustle and flow of Guangdong province , where intense development just seems to whet the appetite for more development , and work reigns supreme . On the road to the ferry terminal that links Shenzhen to Hong Kong , a hortatory billboard declares , " Time is money . Efficiency is life . " <p> Guangdong at a glance <p> What it is : South China province that produces one-third of all Chinese exports and attracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Population 110 million . Capital is Guangzhou ( Canton ) , with a population of more than 10 million . Border boomtown is Shenzhen , population 7 million . <p> Historical connection : Guangdong is the ancestral homeland of many Chinese Americans , from the 19th century to today . <p> Why Bay Area firms are setting up shop there : Tax breaks , cheap land , fast track for building projects , modern rail , road , water and airport facilities and well-educated Pearl River Delta workforce for manufacturing . Proximity to Hong Kong for front-office administration , banking and shipping . <p> Who 's there : U.S. firms such as Cisco ; Oracle ; Intel ; Proctor &; Gamble ; Autodesk ; Skidmore , Owings and Merrill ; GE Plastics ; plus medium- and small-size American companies ; Japanese carmakers Toyota and Honda .
