<p> A clash of views on Savage <p> Editor  --  If I read the article about Michael Savage ( " Savage Talk , " Feb. 6 ) correctly , it seems as if he was hiding in academia at a time when he could have been drafted . <p> Am I the only one fed up with these " chicken hawks " who trumpet their " patriotism " and desire to send other people off to war , and possibly death , while declining to serve themselves ? <p> ROLLAND CARLSON <p> Reno . <p> Editor  --  As a longtime subscriber to The Chronicle , I was taken aback by the article about talk show host Michael Savage . <p> I do not listen to any radio talk shows , preferring to gain my information through print . However , I am aware that the airwaves are full of commentators expressing political and social views ranging almost exclusively from far right to far , far , far right . <p> The Chronicle certainly has the right to print an article about one such host ; however , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of his outrageous , insulting and crude comments . It seemed almost as if you were amused or entertained by them and hoped your readers would be , too . <p> I only recently became aware that the Fairness Doctrine , which I had believed was still in effect , had been repealed as long ago as during Reagan 's term . If we cherish free speech , should n't there be free speech across the entire political spectrum ? <p> It really scares me to think that many people who can not be bothered to read newspapers , wherein are printed many points of view , get all their " information " exclusively from these radio sources . <p> ROBERTA HOLLOWELL <p> Santa Rosa . <p> Editor  --  The article on Michael Savage confirms what many of us already know : He 's a hate-monger who will drop to any depths to gain notoriety . Conversely , we have two of the most articulate , accomplished and respected talk show hosts in the country on KGO . Both Ronn Owens and Gene Burns are reasonably objective , incredibly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subjects . How about an interview with these two gentlemen ? <p> KENT MITCHEL <p> Healdsburg . <p> Editor  --  Dan Fost 's article about Michael Savage was full of contempt . It is to be expected . I am an admirer of Savage 's because it is almost impossible to find someone in the public eye that tells the truth these days . Savage does it , and that is the reason why some people do n't like him . <p> Yes , I 'll concede that he is egotistic , but who is n't in that business ? A shy , self-effacing individual would never make it in talk radio or television ! <p> As for Savage bashing immigrants , I am Hispanic , I came to the United States as a legal immigrant , I am a U.S. citizen and like Michael Savage , I am against illegal immigration . Mr. Fost has taken literary liberty by stating that Savage bashes immigrants . Not true . He is against illegal immigration . <p> I hope more radio talk show hosts follow his footsteps . The mainstream news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps it in the dark and feeds it a lot of manure . <p> NHAYDEE PAVIA <p> Laguna Woods ( Orange County ) . <p> Editor  --  So The Chronicle has just now discovered that Michael Savage has a huge audience in the Bay Area and around the nation ? Had you guys moved your dial away from NPR once in a while , it might not have taken 10 years to make this discovery . <p> BRIAN MALONEY <p> Talk show host <p> KIRO 710 AM <p> Seattle . <p> VIVID MEMORIES OF WAR <p> Editor  --  Thank you for Jon Carroll 's column this morning ( " We are punting for the coffin corner , " Feb. 11 ) . The memories of the blood dripping from the dead and wounded in Vietnam are still vivid to me . That is why I marched and demonstrated against the Vietnam War after returning to the states , and why I continue to march against Mr. Bush 's plans to invade Iraq . <p> To settle a dispute by ripping a fellow human 's body into bloody pieces is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life , and only as a last resort . Vietnam did n't meet that criteria , and neither does today 's situation in Iraq . <p> PAUL BARWICK <p> San Francisco . <p> MEDS CA N'T TREAT CREEPS <p> Editor  --  Tim Goodman writes ( " Jackson show is over but he 's still creeping us out . " Feb. 12 ) : " Reason 34 why we could n't be a TV journalist : Two or three or 23 times we would have said to Jackson , ' Um , you are sooooo off your meds . ' " <p> The pharmaceutical industry must be delighted that " off his meds " has become an acceptable phrase in popular culture . <p> However , despite the drug companies ' ad campaigns and effective use of front groups , psychotropic medication is no more a cure for " creepiness " than it is for homelessness or other things that we might find disturbing . <p> KATHIE ZATKIN <p> Berkeley . <p> BIGGER IS N'T BETTER <p> Editor  --  I read with great pain the article on the megaplex experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 ) . <p> Living here in Hayward , I have seen the theaters in this city go from three to two to one , and as of last month , zero ! All because of the bookended threat of the Century 25 in Union City and the Century 16 in San Leandro . Much harder to take is the demise of many of the great theaters I used to frequent growing up here : the Laurel and Tivoli in San Carlos , the Manor and Hillsdale Cinema in San Mateo , the Fox in Redwood City , the Varsity in Palo Alto , the UC Theater in Berkeley and many more . <p> I used to go to the 4 Star , Pagoda Palace and others to see Jackie Chan films before any of the mall theater patrons knew who he was . Some of his best films were shown there , movies that will never be on U.S. multitheater screens . <p> Smaller theaters also used to show old films and classics . Going to the Laurel to see marathons of the Three Stooges or a 3-D showing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connery James Bond film was always a blast . The UC Theater in Berkeley had great programs and many excellent older double-features . Theaters like this are getting harder and harder to find . <p> Now we 're stuck with megaplexes that show a single " blockbuster " on a half-dozen screens the first week of release , only to have it relegated to a single screen about the size of the TV in my bedroom on subsequent weeks when the masses figure out how bad it really is . <p> There should be a way for the two types of venue to coexist : the megaplexes for the new films and the single-/double-screen smaller houses for harder-to-see films . DVD and cable also contribute to the extinction of the smaller theaters . People should realize that there is no substitute for seeing a movie as it was meant to be shown , on a large 35mm or 70mm projected image . <p> BOB JOHNSON <p> Hayward . <p> CRITIC MISREAD MUSIC <p> Editor  --  Joshua Kosman 's review of Dmitri Shostakovich 's Eighth Symphony performed by the San Francisco Symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Feb. 8 ) fails to understand the composer and does regrettable injustice to the conductor . <p> The article reminds the reader of the reception this work received by parts of the communist elite after its initial performances . Mr. Kosman 's criticism , though one would presume is not ideologically based , is just as misguided . <p> In both instances , the main contention is with the symphony 's finale , which tends to leave the audience in quiet awe and in some cases bewilderment rather than bringing them ecstatically to their feet . <p> Shostakovich wrote this C minor symphony during the summer of 1943 , a time much different from the 1941 of his preceding symphony , the Leningrad . It is this very difference in time and place , since the Seventh was begun in his besieged hometown while the Eighth was written in an artists colony away from the front lines , that helps explain this symphony and its last movement . <p> The previous winter of 1942-43 had seen some of the most fierce and brutal fighting of the war , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " grim " and as " setting some kind of record for unmodulated savagery . " That same winter , though , had brought the decisive German setback at Stalingrad and with it the realization that Nazi defeat , and thus Soviet victory , was eventually inevitable . <p> In the fifth movement of his first symphony after this crucial battle briefly , subtitled " Stalingrad " but subsequently left without such dedication , Shostakovich 's music starts to look already past the still-raging war and beyond future victory parades . <p> The scores of war dead  --  in the end there would be 20 million of them in his country alone  --  do n't lead to a heroic musical score , at least not in this work . There is , however , a sense of hope in this musical ending , a deep knowledge that life will ultimately return to a sense of normality . <p> It is exactly this quiet , melancholy yet hope-filled finale that Stalin 's commissars did not understand or appreciate , for it did not offer glorification of the war . <p> Mr. Kosman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , misses exactly that point when he calls the finale " weirdly lighthearted , but irrelevant . " It is a profound misreading of a great symphony , a false impression that Mr. Rostropovich , who first met Shostakovich the year he composed the Eighth , tried to dispel once and for all from the podium .
