Type in " Catholic " on an Internet search engine , and the more than 4 million results are proof that Catholics are a cyberforce to be reckoned with . // The lunchtime Ash Wednesday Mass at the university chapel was packed with people , and everyone was on a tight schedule . So when it came time for the homily , the presider 's message was brief . He said , " I know we 're all pressed for time , so I 'll keep it short . Please check out our Lent Web site for daily homilies . " in the Archdiocese of St. Louis , a prayer-request section on the archdiocesan Web site has received 13,000 submissions since its inception last September . Many Catholics are lobbying for a patron saint of the Internet . After all , pasta eaters and pilots have one , so why not Internet users ? These recent news briefs indicate an emerging trend : a grand Catholic presence on the Web . The empirical evidence ? Type the word " Catholic " into the search engine Google ( www.google.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-described " cybermonk " Brother John Raymond , author of Catholics on the Internet ( Prima Publishing ) , who estimates that 18 to 20 million Catholics are online . In addition , a recent study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that more than 2 million Americans search the Internet for religious or spiritual material . If sheer numbers are any indication , the marriage of Catholicism and the Web will be a lasting one . They may seem strange bedfellows : a religious tradition spanning two millennia and a newfangled and fast technology . However unusual , the cyber-spiritual union portends some exciting changes for the church , particularly in the areas of spirituality , community , and social justice . Spirituality at work Catholics have always had many choices when it comes to spirituality . The immediate dilemma facing anyone seeking spiritual information online is n't the paucity of information but the plenitude . Web visitors can participate in online retreats , submit prayer requests to religious communities , make " virtual pilgrimages " to holy sites , or pray the Ignatian exercises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback pages " indicates how the Web is changing the way people pray . Many people have Internet access only at the office . Long and stressful workdays in front of the computer provoke workplace Web denizens to search for a moment of solace and reflection . In the midst of deadlines and duties , the Web serves as a portal for prayer . Those who visit the Irish Jesuits ' Sacred Space ( www jesuit.ie/prayer ) , a 10-minute online version of the Ignatian exercises , share thoughts of gratitude for the assistance to pray while " sitting in an office trying to handle a stressful job while traffic rumbles outside , " as one Web traveler from Hong Kong says . " Today , " he continues , " I add Sacred Space to my favorites list on the PC in my office . Being one of a management staff in a finance company , I find it very confusing to choose between God and earning a living . Fortunately I could get close to God through Sacred Space in the office whenever I need . " A Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer for the local county jail .... Visiting Sacred Space has given me peace to quietly minister to both fellow officers and inmates alike . " And from Adelaide , South Australia : " I arrive at work early to allow myself 10 minutes of peace and spiritual nourishment to strengthen myself for the many encounters of the day . " Arriving at the office early in order to pray ? Now that 's revolutionary . Unlimited access Houses of worship close for the night . Places of pilgrimage are often noisy and crowded , or perhaps they are too far away . One grateful retreatant using Creighton University 's Online Ignatian Retreat ( www.creighton.edul **38;451;TOOLONG ) comments : " For years I 've tried to find a way to make an Ignatian retreat , but the retreat center is about 300 miles from where I live . The Lord seems to have a way of seeing that we get what we need when we need it . " Virtual pilgrimages and prayers will never rival the experience of real , live communal prayer , yet the uniqueness of online prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation . One can access spiritual sites from an armchair at home or from a hotel overseas at 2 in the morning . There is room for anyone , 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . Photograph The dilemma facing anyone seeking spiritual information online is n't the paucity of information but the plenitude. // No one seems as appreciative of this availability than those who are homebound or handicapped . Says one cyber-retreatant : " I have a disability and have not been out of my home since October , waiting for a ramp to be built for my electric wheelchair . ... The Ignatian Retreat site has given me a way to make a retreat that otherwise would be impossible . " An Australian visitor to Sacred Space echoes a similar sense of appreciation : " Being disabled , wheelchair-bound , and using the Internet for research purposes , I find that Sacred Space is very helpful indeed . I will visit during my research periods . " Virtual prayer sites can be visited in the middle of the afternoon or at 3 in the morning-when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car is not running , or the kids are in bed , writes Brenda Brasher , author of Give Me That Online Religion ( Jossey-Bass ) . Whenever the opportunity for contemplation arises , online religion is there . There are no space limitations in virtual chapels . Cyberspace is wide , deep , and timeless . High-speed spirituality Technological problems with one 's modem not withstanding , one of the chief characteristics of cyberspace is speed . Is such alacrity compatible with a tradition that cherishes such practices as lectio divina or contemplative prayer , which require slow and deliberate reflection ? Some skeptics say that Internet-generated images invite mere reaction rather than reflection and invite it at the level of instinctive , rather than reflective responses . Chris McGillion , a reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald , laments , " What we gain in information we lose in insight . " The Web , with its onslaught of information and , in particular , links that invite and persuade readers to move from one link to the next , seems to encourage a sort of flippant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is intended in most Catholic spiritual practices . Is it possible to read lots of interesting or well-written material on the Internet without feeling the urgent need to click and move on ? At the bottom of almost every Web page lurks an enticing promise of many more links . This may indeed be the case , but many of those who pray online are able to overcome the temptation to " surf . " A visitor to Sacred Space writes : " Often , visiting this site is the highlight of my day and makes me long to spend more time deep in the Word . Now at church I find the texts so jam-packed that it is like a symphony played over the top of another . Cascading come the ideas one on top of another , like a crowded theater spilling out after a play .

We gather together Anyone who has been to a humdrum liturgy or poorly planned prayer service is aware that physical presence alone does not guarantee a prayerful experience of community . As Henri Nouwen , Donald P. McNeill , and Douglas A. Morrison , authors of the book Compassion ( Doubleday ) , point out in their chapter on community : " People who live together do not necessarily live in community , and those who live alone do not necessarily live without it . Physical nearness is secondary . The primary quality of community is a deep sense of being gathered by God . " Using this as a criterion for community , one can easily come to the conclusion , based on the many positive responses , that people who visit prayer sites-though they are not gathered physically-do experience some form of community . Gregory Pierce , who facilitates an email discussion group on spirituality in the workplace , acknowledges that " there is an intimacy and immediacy to the Internet that does not exist in other media . " Pierce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of community is generated by mutual interest in a topic . This certainly seems to be the case at the Henri Nouwen Literary Centre Web site ( nouwen. net ) , where the spiritual writer 's former students , friends , those he mentored , and readers share their memories of Nouwen . A Vancouver , Washington man writes , " I am moved by the comments I read of people who have been touched by this man . It sounds like his influence will continue to be felt for a long time to come . " The Internet , being the " democratic " medium that it is , levels the traditional hierarchies or discrete roles present in realtime gatherings like liturgical prayer . Variables like race , gender , and education level are masked by a screen name or e-mail address . The Internet provides an egalitarian atmosphere in which people share very readily and honestly . Such broad participation is one of the primary characteristics of authentic community , according to the authors of Compassion : " It is remarkable how many people still think of priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual elite .... The danger of this way of thinking is that it divides the People of God into " ordinary " Christians and special Christians , ' not leading to togetherness but separation . Real community can reveal that what separates us is less important than what unites us . " The genius of Internet prayer sites is that they give people a space in which to share . And is n't genuine sharing at the heart of community ? Community at its core is the sense of shared thoughts and ideas , a sense of mutual interchange . And this mutual interchange is providing comfort for many , such as this participant in Creighton 's Online Retreat : " Today my husband had a CT scan to recheck a spot that might be cancer . I had just started an online retreat and was inspired . Late last night , I read a note from someone in a very similar situation . I realized that we are not alone in our prayers and that none of us is alone in our suffering . " The challenge left for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this liminal sense of community to a real , live worshiping community . Avery Dulles , in Models of the Church ( Doubleday ) , writes , " The church is never more church than when it gathers for the liturgy . " The content on truly community-oriented Web sites should draw people to parishes , to retreat centers , to campus ministry offices . For example , the campus ministry Web site at the University of Dayton ( www.udayton.edu/-campmin ) posts reflections on Reconciliation next to dates and times that indicate where and when the sacrament is available . The Christ in the Desert Monastery homepage ( www.christdesert.org ) invites Web visitors to " live " community as well . Clicking on a monk icon calls up information about housing at Christ in the Desert , along with an online form to reserve space there . These kinds of connections are vital if Web developers want to draw people into a live , physically gathered , learning , and praying community . Closing the digital divide No discussion of the Internet and social justice is complete without addressing the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a March 1998 address to the New Tech ' ' 98 Conference in Denver , said , " As I see it , the issue of access is the overarching new justice issue ' calling for some measure of resolution in our times . " People who use the Internet either have sufficient income to pay for access or are engaged in activities that make access available to them . Recent U.S. Department of Trade and Commerce statistics report that there is a direct correlation between poverty and lack of access to information technology , and the specifics are even more disturbing . First , Caucasians are more likely to have access to the Internet from home than many minority groups have from any location . Second , households with incomes of $75,000 and higher are more than 20 times more likely to have Internet access than those at the lowest income levels and almost 10 times as likely to have a computer at home . The " digital divide " between the information-rich and the information-poor is a matter of social justice . And social justice , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and systems , " says Ron Krietemeyer , director of the Office for Social Justice ( OSJ ) in the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis . Part of Krietemeyer 's own effort to " change the rules " is the OSJ Web site ( www.osjspm.org ) . The OSJ site catalogs hundreds of pages of Catholic social teaching in various formats , including tips for teachers and parish social-action committees . The Catholic social teaching information is organized in an attractive , step-by-step format that " encourages people to go to the next level , " says Krietemeyer . " We try to entice .... Most people will probably never look at a full Catholic social teaching encyclical . Hopefully they will become curious , go deeper , maybe read the whole thing .

Though he uses the Internet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krietemeyer discourages people from using e-mail for legislative advocacy . " We would rather get a small number of phone calls or letters . They take more time , require a special effort . We use e-mail only as a last resort . " Though e-mail may not be an effective tool for legislative advocacy , it has had a positive effect on those who work in social justice arenas , according to Deborah Wallace Ruddy at the John A. Ryan Institute for Catholic Social Thought at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul , Minnesota . " In the social justice arena there is a lot of sharing of material via Web sites and e-mail , " she says . " People really believe in Catholic social teaching , and it 's a matter of getting the word out . They are sharing PowerPoint presentations , programs for in-services , and lots of other resources . There are no turf wars . There is a good spirit in the social justice community . The online sharing allows people to work as a team . " Both Krietemeyer and Ruddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in a honeymoon period . " It 's still early , " says Krietemeyer , and , according to Ruddy , " the grand vision is not yet established . " Yet , given new technology 's proven ability to influence religion , the Net 's early success guarantees that it will have a transformative impact on Catholicism . Sidebar Maybe this has happened to you . While online , you decide to drop in on a few Sidebar of the Catholic Web sites you 've bookmarked , monitored , but never dared to participate in-even with the anonymity of having a bogus user name . But tonight 's discussion catches your eye , and you decide to weigh in with your two cents ' worth on using artificial contraception . Sidebar Wham ! You get slammed by two surly surfers who call you " anti-family , " selfish , and hell bent There 's a third who 's not as mean-spirited as the others , but the saccharine in her paternalistic tone-poor dimwitted you , you 're " misguided " - smarts just as much as that employed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense and tell the other posters to Sidebar take a hike . But Sidebar you 're left with the lonely feeling of being all by yourself in front of the computer , amazed at how " mere words " can sting when they 're negative and how inadequate they are when coming to your defense . It was experiences like these that caused one woman to ask Yahoo 's Theology and Religion discussion group just why there seemed to be so much ultraconservativeand seemingly **25;491;TOOLONG on the Web . She was seriously considering the possibility of becoming a Catholic , but when she went online to explore the more weighty matters of faith , such punitive responses left her puzzled and disappointed . " So " , she asked the discussion group 's niceguy moderator , " what gives ? Is it just me , or Sidebar are there Sidebar more conservative voices on the Internet than progressive ones ? " " Why do you hear more from our more traditionalist or conservative Catholics ? " asked discussion leaderJohn Switzer .

" We humans tend to say little when things are going " our " perceived way . But Sidebar when it changes , watch us hoop and holler and yell and scream and rave . And I find those metaphors to be accurate for some of the extremely traditionalist or ultraconservative groups . Those in the middle , however , are beginning to wake up and are becoming heard . But we 're often portrayed as not committed or of being of weak morals or faith ( those were slung at me when I taught religion ) or as dissenters . " So , do n't give up . Ultimately , we 're all cafeteria Catholics and we 're all progressives . That 's because none of us can know the mind of Christ perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner that exactly mirrors God 's glory . A 2-ounce bottle can not contain the ocean .
