Superstar Janet Jackson performs during a concert and with justin Timberlakc ( right ) during the controversial Super Bowl half-time performance . // JANET JACKSON appears demure and fragile as she sits on a low but comfortable sofa in a West Los Angeles recording studio . She offers to share her Asian lunch of rice and seaweed and a large green salad tossed in a teriyaki dressing . It is 10 days after the Super Bowl incident , and she is trying to get on with her life . She has an album to finish , a tour to organize , videos to shoot , and a personal life to nourish . In a barely audible angelic voice , she insists that she is " okay , " that she 's strong and can tough it out . But the hurt and embarrassment are evident on her hauntingIy beautiful face and in the language of her lithe , well-toned body . " This is the first time I 've ever had to deal with something like this , " she says softly . Until Super Bowl Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the quiet and talented one among the huge and talented Jackson clan . No trouble , no controversy . She sold out concerts and spun out platinum-plus albums . Yes , she had survived the heartbreak of two broken marriages , but that only made her more human , more normal . But that all changed at halftime of the Super Bowl , when during a performance with justin Timberlake her right breast was suddenly exposed . She and Timberlake immediately said it was an accident , that it was a " wardrobe malfunction , " a theatrical moment that went very wrong . A media brouhaha and moralizing followed . The FCC threatened to fine CBS and MTV , which produced the halftime show . ( Both are owned by media giant Viacom . ) Despite Janet 's taped apology being broadcast worldwide , she was " uninvited " to participate in the Grammy Awards ( also on CBS ) one week after the Super Bowl . Then she and Timberlake were told they could participate in the music industry 's biggest event if they apologized during the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show . Topping off a wild week of media frenzy , the FCC hosted media decency hearings on Capitol Hill , during which CBS and MTV executives testified they knew nothing about the Jackson performance stunt . " It was not intentional . It was a costume accident , " says soft-spoken Janet during an exclusive interview with EBONY , the first media interview she has given since the Super Bowl . " I 've moved on . I feel fine . There 's been a lot of support . There 's still a lot going on , " she says of the media onslaught that has been called " unfair , " " blown out of proportion " and " racist . " Why did it all happen ? " It was an accident , " she says . " That was basically it . " When asked if she felt her family gets singled out and picked on because they are Jacksons , she said : " Yeah . I was with my brother Mike and my brother Randy just yesterday morning . And I was thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well may be because of who we are . It 's a lot harder . A lot of times I think it 's because of who the family is , " she continues , then hesitates , pondering her words . " We 're very strong , as a people period . And I have a very strong family . We can handle it . What 's so funny is that this is my first time of truly having to deal with something like this , which I 've never experienced before . My brothers and sisters have though . But I 'm okay . Photograph Shown with her boyfriend Jermaine Dupri ( top photo ) , Janet says : " I 'm in love . " She is pictured above with brothers Michael and Randy and father Joe after Michael 's arraignment . // " People have always said I look like my mother , I feel that I look more like my father . My mother 's so beautiful . But I have my mother 's strength more so than anything . I realize that now . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that . " She is very strong . She 's gone through a lot too . Since she was a baby , having polio when she was younger . Every time her children go through something , just being a parent , she goes through it too . That was my worry when this happened . My parents , and my nieces and nephews . Kids at school can be so cruel with all the jokes and teasing . And there are so many of them more than 20 nieces and nephews in all . It 's going to take a while to touch base with each one of them , but I 'm working on it . It 's not an easy thing for them to deal with . And it 's not their fault . They just have that last name . " Jackson . It is a name symbolic of talent and music and family . In recent years , it is a name associated with unusual behavior and scandalous headlines . In past years older sister LaToya has made headlines , and brother Michael , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jackson clan , is now embroiled in a court case in which he is accused of child molestation . Janet says there have been so many mistruths concerning the Super Bowl performance that she ca n't keep up with them all . " I 'm now told that Luther said he did n't want to receive the Grammy unless I presented it to him , but I was told initially that his family thought it was better that I not present it to him . But that did n't come from his family . A lot of things they put a hush on , like his statement . " She goes on to say that some television stations did n't run all of her taped apology . " Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident , " she says . " That 's what the media does , that 's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way . I probably should have done it live , but there was so much going on at the time that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . And it will pass and I 'm fine with it . I 've already moved on to completing my project . " That project , Damita Jo , will be Janet 's eighth album , five of which have been No. 1 . She also has five Grammy Awards , and she 's done two films and gotten an Oscar nomination . She 's sold millions of records , but this recording will be a departure for the pop diva . Whereas in the past she has worked exclusively with super-producers Jimmy ( Jam ) Harris and Terry Lewis , this time she is working with the dynamic duo in addition to a variety of other hot producers , including Kenneth ( Babyface ) Edmonds , Kanye West , Dallas Austin and Rock Wilder . In the days and weeks after the Super Bowl incident , she has busied herself in the studio doing what she does best-making great music . And everywhere she goes , the camera-toting paparazzi are n't far behind . " I 've always had the paparazzi around me , but now they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stop at a light and they get out of their cars and try to take photographs of me . That 's a bit much . They followed me here . I get followed all the time . " Jackson describes herself as a very giving person . " I put others first and worry about other people 's feelings and their issues before I worry about myself , " she confesses . " It 's not a good thing because you are supposed to take care of yourself first . How can you be there for someone else if you ca n't take care of yourself ? Photograph Comedian Eddie Griffin ( from left ) , Firpol Carr and rapper Treach speak in support of Janet Jackson , who was disinvited from participating in the Grammy Awards after the Super Bowl incident . // " And I definitely have a bad temper , but you 've got to push me for it to come out . When you push me , you see horns and the steam and my eyes turn red . " She laughs . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says confidently . " But not in anger . Iget I mad though , and that 's not a good thing . My anger displayed itself when my brother had his hearing . " She tells how as they were leaving the courthouse , she , Michael and her mother all witnessed incidents in which the police were mistreating fans . " My brother and mother saw the cops with dogs take a girl by her hair and yank her down to the ground . At the same time I saw a cop take a girl and shove her right in the throat , and she fell back . We put our heads out the windows and yelled at the cops . But the TV cameras did n't show what the cops were doing . And the kids were n't doing anything wrong . They were just excited . You know where my head went immediately ? Back to the civil rights protests when they had the dogs . For a split second my head went back to all that footage I 've seen . People were getting pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of it . So , that was a little bit of my anger . " The softer side of Janet Jackson comes through when she peppers the conversation with references to her romantic partner , renowned record producer Jermaine Dupri . She turns rather girlish and giggly when his name comes up . She tells how she took him to one of her favorite vacation spots , Peter Island in the British Virgin Islands , because she wanted to share it with him . She is delighted that her family likes him . " Things are great with us , " she says , hiding her blushing face behind two well-manicured slender hands . " I 'm sorry , but I get so tickled when you say his name . It 's so funny because I 've never been in a relationship when my friends adore him and my family just loves him . It 's a first for me . But more importantly , I love him . Everything is great . " She tells how Dupri teases her because she ca n't remember when they first met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and gradually became close friends before falling in love . She says they have been " committed " for about 16 to 17 months . " How did I know he was the one ? " she asks , repeating the question . " It just sneaked up on me . I did n't expect it . THhere is something different about him . And even my sister LaToya , just being the big sister that she is , just embarrassed me when he visited the family . She said , " You know Janet has never brought anyone she 's dated home to meet the family before/ She was just telling him all kinds of things about me , about my cooking , and he 's looking at me with those big eyes , and I 'm still getting questions about why I wo n't cook for him . Honestly , Lynn , it just hits me and it just keeps getting stronger and stronger . When I think it ca n't go any further , it gets stronger . " I 've never had anyone who has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for me . It 's weird because you go through so much bad crap in your life , so much pain , and you never think you 'll get it right . Everything just fell into place . " She goes on to say that " everything is special about him , " that " he 's so nice . " One sure sign that he 's the one is that her family loves him . " You know that it 's something different when your whole family falls in love with him , when your brothers and sisters love him . And with me having eight brother and sisters , there are some major eyes on him . And they all adore him . So that 's really good . " Asked how she responds to those who say that she and Dupri are not a good match , she says : " People need to stay out of other people 's business . Honestly , how can they say what is a good match for me and what is a good match for him ? They really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They need to stay out of other people 's business and deal with their own issues . " Miss Jackson has spoken .
