The way in to the office of Gordon Hinckley , the president of the Mormon church , leads through long carpeted corridors with wood-paneled walls and security doors that swing open noiselessly with no visible movement from the guards . It is like walking into a David Lynch movie . In these hushed precincts , groups of gray-haired men in identical black suits pass by , beaming smiles like undertakers . Everyone is scrupulously polite , but as a visitor , one feels that one has been dropped into the middle of a plot , without knowing the beginning or the end . <P> Hinckley , Mormons believe , is in direct contact with God and so presumably is party to the whole plot . Thus the faithful paid close attention last July when the head of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints stood up to make his annual speech for Pioneer Day . But instead of a soothing homage to Mormon virtues and achievements in the 154 years since the pioneers settled Utah , Hinckley , 91 , gave the world 's 11 million Mormons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that Utah 's population had now acquired " great diversity , " Hinckley admonished the Mormon majority for being clannish and adopting holier-than-thou attitudes . The speech has become a watershed in Utah , a focus of debate over the church 's future . Hinckley , whose smiling bonhomie floats over such controversy , told TIME in an interview in his office , " I am an open individual . I think we all ought to be that way  --  but it is all a process ; it does n't happen in a day . " Since becoming president in 1995 , the media-savvy Hinckley has been trying to gently nudge the LDS church to be more open . It has not been easy . Even recent proposals to supply condoms to Olympic athletes drew protest . Mormonism is virtually synonymous with Utah , and the conservative religion has shaped the state politically , socially and culturally . But as the church changes , so does the state . Both have seized upon the Olympics , with its anticipated 1.5 million visitors and 3 billion worldwide TV audience , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images before the world . " We hope , with so many people among us , it will be helpful in dispelling old prejudices , " says Hinckley . <P> The image of Utah was briefly sullied by the revelation in late 1998 that members of the International Olympic Committee had accepted cash , gifts and college tuition for their children amounting to more than $1 million in advance of awarding the Winter Games to Salt Lake  --  following an ugly precedent set by other winning cities . Tom Welch , a former president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee , and Dave Johnson , a former senior vice president , were indicted on federal charges , including bribery and fraud . The charges were dismissed last year , but the Justice Department last month appealed the dismissal . All along , the Mormon church has tried to keep the scandal at arm 's length  --  Hinckley says he had instructed the church to remain strictly " neutral " in every aspect of the Olympics . The hope is that by the opening ceremonies , the scandal will be largely forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
