<p> LOS ANGELES - When the last labor negotiations got particularly hot and Michael Jordan made a rare appearance at the negotiating table , Jordan tried to take on Wizards owner Abe Pollin for the first time . <p> No one has owned an NBA team longer than Pollin , who for all the failings of his team , rightly considered himself to be one of the architects of the stage on which Jordan had made his legend and fortune . <p> The league 's owners had argued that without changes , they would be run out of the business . And when Jordan told Pollin that if he could no longer afford to run an NBA franchise , then maybe he should get out , Pollin leaned across the table and responded with a bitter , two-word suggestion . <p> Owners applauded Pollin 's gumption to out trash talk even Jordan . But all was apparently forgotten when Jordan thought he had cashed in on his power to join the NBA 's exclusive ownership club and run Pollin 's team . <p> But Jordan forgot too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is admired and liked around the league . But he showed himself to be petty and small when he so gracelessly canned Jordan last week . <p> He let Jordan play executive for 3 1/2 years and indulge himself with two seasons back on the court . But mostly , Pollin let Jordan carry his woeful franchise from complete irrelevancy and make him a fortune by selling out every home game in which he played . <p> To argue that Jordan deserved to be fired because he was a bad executive misses the point . Did anyone actually think the Washington Wizards he took over would be any more than they are now ? They were a horrible team paralyzed by horrible contracts . <p> Not every move could be considered wise . Hiring Leonard Hamilton and trading Richard Hamilton were mistakes . Other moves - drafting Kwame Brown , Juan Dixon and Jared Jeffries - will be judged later . <p> But horrible NBA franchises are not turned around in 3 1/2 years . The other guys are trying , too . <p> But that was not why Pollin fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization and in the locker room that came with Jordan 's unforgiving and caustic nature and unwillingness to accept that everyone was not driven as he . <p> He did not like the way Jordan did not kowtow to those in the front office before him . He did not like the way his franchise , long a genial , comfortable place to work , had become so tense . <p> The Wizards no longer felt like his team , so Pollin took them back . He had used Jordan all he cared to and then was willing to throw him out . <p> It did not matter that Jordan could have scratched his itch to play anywhere and only chose the Wizards out of loyalty to Pollin and for the implied understanding that he would return to his front office position . <p> It did not matter that Jordan took the franchise that Pollin had led to consistent failure and at least made it Pollin 's own ATM machine . It did not matter that Pollin , long respected and admired in D.C. , would have been ripped as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their meeting at the negotiating table had been forgotten . But Pollin had showed a taste then for being able , at almost 80 years old , to beat the great Michael Jordan . <p> So he beat Jordan again last week . But even if Jordan turns out to be the inadequate executive many have suggested , Pollin lost . <p> Around the league <p> Racism lingers - Nets coach Byron Scott has been popping off about all things Boston , calling Celtics fans " cruel and crazy . " Scott said he and other black players were never comfortable playing there in the 1980s . <p> " I think there is still a part of that out there , " Scott said about the race issue . " They are not very good fans . You can have a great tradition and be a great fan without being crazy and hostile . <p> " Some organizations have n't caught up to the year 2000 . Their fans can be very cruel , and they can be crazy . The come in pretty juiced up . " <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the league to fill the open jobs around the league , largely because some of the top candidates are still in the playoffs and because Paul Silas is suddenly available . But things are taking shape . <p> Silas spent some time with the Mavericks this week and could succeed Don Nelson . But he has spoken with the Raptors and will be a candidate with the Hawks and Clippers . Incredibly , he might choose to leave George Shinn and Ray Wooldridge , whom he called " crazy " owners , to work for Donald Sterling in Los Angeles . <p> Mike Dunleavy will be a candidate with the Clippers , Cavaliers and Hawks . Dunleavy could wait to see if the Cavaliers land LeBron James , but is close to future Hawks owner David McDavid and most likely would land in Atlanta . <p> Mike Fratello 's friendship with Wooldridge makes him an early favorite in New Orleans , though former Bulls , Iowa State and University of New Orleans coach Tim Floyd will be a candidate and would love a chance to actually coach a real NBA roster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite to land in Toronto . He 's calmed down a bit since his days at Marquette and Northwestern and is widely credited for designing the system that helped the Pistons become the league 's top defensive team . <p> Meanwhile , former Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy wants to get back in coaching but is likely too expensive for the Hornets , who have never paid more than $ 1.5 million for a coach or ranked higher than 19th in the league in coaching salary . Dave Cowens was fired for complaining about his salary . <p> " When or where that is I have no idea , " Van Gundy said of his return to coaching . " So I 'll look for a situation that 's the right situation . I had a dream job for so many years with the Knicks . But the next job , you will know it when you talk to ownership and they share views on how important winning is . <p> " I need to go to a place where they 're really trying to win and winning a championship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Pistons coach Rick Carlisle , darn him , took the high road . After calls for his dismissal in Detroit when the Pistons fell behind in the first round , Carlisle refused to claim any vindication after the Pistons rallied to eliminate the Magic . <p> " This is about winning , " Carlisle said . " I came under attack to a certain degree , but that 's part of the game . If you want an opportunity to sit in this chair , you are going to have to deal with certain things . " <p> Pistons president Joe Dumars met with Carlisle before Game 5 , reassuring him that his job was safe and that the media criticism was overblown . <p> " Joe came into my office and he said , ' Hey , do n't pay attention to any of that stuff . ' But mostly , I am just really proud of the players , " Carlisle said . " To crawl out of that hole and make history ( seventh team to win a series after trailing 3-1 ) is a great tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Garnett top priority - Even if the Timberwolves had not just gone through their seventh consecutive first-round elimination from the playoffs , they would have work to do . <p> They really do n't have many options to improve . But general manager Kevin McHale and owner Glen Taylor will spend the summer in negotiations with their own , starting with Kevin Garnett . <p> Taylor wants Garnett 's name on a contract extension by the start of next season . Garnett is going into the last season of his six-year , $ 126 million deal and is eligible for an extension beginning at $ 29.5 million a season . That will force the Wolves to negotiate a paycut with Garnett as he comes off the best season of his career . <p> Taylor , however , said he will not deal Garnett , as he did Stephon Marbury , if he can not get an extension done this summer . <p> " The only way we would probably trade him is if Kevin said that he really thought that was the best thing for him , or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be built on something I could n't even think of right now . We do n't want to and I do n't think he would want to , but that would be the scenario , I suppose . I do n't think I would necessarily accept that just because he said that . But that 's a possibility . " <p> The Wolves could have eight free agents : Rasho Nesterovic , Rod Strickland , Kendall Gill , Loren Woods , Gary Trent , Felipe Lopez , Mike Wilks and Anthony Peeler , who has a team option . <p> It was bound to happen - Did anybody anywhere actually think the Mavericks would be run out of the playoffs without one night similar to Thursday 's blowout against the Kings ? The Mavericks ca n't help but turn games into layup lines and target practice on occasion . The question that does not change is if they can win when they are not shooting so incredibly well . . . . Former Rockets assistant Bill Berry was fired by the Bulls . Berry is widely respected , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . <p> To put Shaquille O'Neal on the All-interview team is insane . As interesting as he can be , he is only occasionally available and usually mumbles too much to be heard . . . . <p> The best story on the All-Rookie teams ? Second-team pick J.R . Bremer , the Celtics point guard who was n't drafted out of St. Bonaventure and who had considered making any team an accomplishment . " It feels good just to be out here playing right now , " he said . " From being an undrafted free agent to starting and playing a lot of minutes to being in the playoffs , it 's been a great year for me . " Selection to the first-team All-Rookie team was also an accomplishment for Drew Gooden . He was the fourth player taken in the draft but had to survive a coaching change in Memphis and a trade to Orlando . " I took a step back and was like , ' This was a tough season , ' " Gooden told the Orlando Sentinel . " Going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two different teams , two different cities , 15 assistant coaches , and all of them thinking you do n't even know how to go to the bathroom . It was a learning experience . " <p> <p> Not the way to react <p> Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan messed up big time and no one , including Ryan , would argue that his suggestion that Joumana Kidd should be " smacked " was not offensive and stupid . <p> But where does Nets coach Byron Scott come off suggesting Ryan deserves to be fired or worse ? <p> " I think Bob should be out of a job , " Scott said . " I think that 's ridiculous . I think that 's uncalled for . <p> " Tell him to come here . Just tell him to come right in here and he can say that in front of me and Jason and some of our players , that he would like to slap her around a little bit . He 'll see how well he 'll be received . " <p> As inexcusable as it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kidd kept his job after actually doing it . And as offended as Scott is that Ryan would say that someone should be hit , he apparently would be just fine with assault and battery in the locker room . But maybe he was just expressing an opinion and went way over the line .
