<p> For weeks , the raw images inside Jason Read 's mind had disappeared . <p> The five days he had spent at ground zero after the towers fell  --  wiggling into smoldering holes to search for survivors , picking through rubble , watching last rites given to firefighters younger than himself  --  all gone . <p> " My brain was probably doing it to protect me , " he said . " That was good because no one is strong enough to process everything that happened down there . You needed time to heal first . " <p> For Read , a rower on the United States national team and volunteer chief of the Amwell Valley Rescue Squad in Ringoes , N.J. , the healing came in quiet places . In his room , with the lights low . At a church , head bowed . On the water , pulling on his oar . <p> And now , though the painful memories of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center will never be gone , Read has transformed them into a positive force : motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glamour event , the men 's eight , at this summer 's Olympics . Although he has been on the senior national team three times before , he said this time would be different . He wants to help the United States eight win its first Olympic gold medal in 40 years  --  not for himself , but for America , for the people who lost their lives or loved ones on Sept. 11 , 2001 . <p> " All of my emotions from that time have been building up inside of me for so long , " Read said , holding back tears . " They are fuel for me , and I 'm going to harness them and win . <p> " I envision it every day , " he added . " I 'll be standing there under the American flag , singing the national anthem . Well , I 'll sing , I guess , if I can . I 'll be so broken up . I 'll be lucky to talk at that point . " <p> Read , whom his teammates and coaches call " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 feet -1 inch and 180 pounds , with brown unruly hair and tanned skin . But what stands out most is his quirky personality , a combination of sensitive and cocky , serious and goofy . <p> One instant , Read is the man who , at 21 , became the youngest volunteer fire chief in New Jersey . He is soulful , mulling over thoughts before verbalizing them in what may be poetry . <p> The next , he is giddy , showing off photos of his most recent crush , a Princeton woman he met while training at the university 's boathouse . During rowing practices , to cut the tension , he always finds something upbeat to say . " I know how to inject needed levity into any situation , " Read said , all scholarly . <p> When he was 12 , his two brothers , both older , simply thought he was obnoxious . Blame it on a friend 's police and fire scanner , which he listened to daily . <p> Soon , Read had a scanner of his own and listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " He drove them crazy with all those little beeping sounds , " said Read 's mother , Joan . " It was like when he was 4 , he was obsessed with naming all the state capitals , all day long . He puts his mind to something and stays there . " <p> Read was 14 when he joined the Hopewell Fire Department in New Jersey as a junior volunteer . At 16 , he became an emergency medical technician . At 17 , during summers , he signed onto the Atlantic City Beach Patrol . <p> When he was 13 , just before his career in rescue began , Read joined his school 's crew team , first as a coxswain , the small guy who sits in the stern of the boat , steering and shouting commands . As a freshman at The Hun School of Princeton , he switched to rowing , just a scrawny kid , at 5-1 , 115 pounds , with big hopes . That season at the Princeton University boathouse , where his school trained , he met Mike Teti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team coach . <p> Read walked up to Teti , smiling wide , silver braces gleaming , and said , " I 'm going to row with you in the Olympics one day . " Teti remembers looking at the boy slim and light as a Popsicle stick and saying , " Sure , kid , sure . " <p> Eventually , Read grew another 12 inches , but was still small for heavyweight rowing , in which there is no maximum size . He has size 14 feet , but is the shortest and lightest man in the United States ' men 's eight . The other rowers are at least 6-3 and 200 pounds . The biggest one is 6-7 , 215 . <p> Teti said Read 's confidence makes up for his size . " I do n't even think J.R . has to train , " he said . " His will is just that powerful . Usually , rowing is 30 percent physical , 30 percent technical and 30 percent psychological , but with Jason , it 's 10 percent physical , 5 percent technical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the man . " <p> At home in New Jersey , Read is the man , in a different way . He lives with his mother in a perfectly appointed house , on a farm of rolling hills where his family used to stable horses and hounds for fox hunting . Between rowing practices at Princeton , 20 minutes away , he is still chief of his rescue squad , active in administrative and hands-on duties . <p> When not trying to raise $100,000 for a new squad station , he tends to car accidents , fires and construction-site mishaps , like a recent one in which a worker broke his leg and several ribs , and could not breathe . <p> " If my teammates and coach knew I was going into a burning building or doing these dangerous things , they 'd kill me , " he said . " So I just tell them I took a nap . " <p> And napping is what Read was doing the morning of Sept. 11 , before he woke up to the sound of his mother crying . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowing Championships in Lucerne , Switzerland , depressed because the team had finished fourth . Returning to regular life , he was commuting to Temple University in Philadelphia , where he was a senior economics major on a rowing scholarship . <p> But on Sept. 11 , he was neither student nor athlete ; he was a rescue worker . He grabbed his lifesaving gear and was off . That night at Liberty State Park , at 23 years old , he was the volunteer communications officer , in charge of mobilizing about 500 doctors , nurses , E.M.T. 's and other emergency workers . <p> In the silence of an eerie evening , even after no survivors came ashore from Manhattan , he kept going . He took a ferry to ground zero to help set up one of the site 's major treatment areas . <p> Walking through the World Financial Center , he learned what he would be dealing with . " It 's where I found a leg , " he said . <p> " For most people , 9/11 was different because they had to digest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " But for the people who were there , we have to somehow reflect and face a profound experience . Our minds were inundated with hundreds of thousands of images . Do you know what kind of introspection that causes ? I thought , ' Why am I still rowing ? I should be enlisting . " ' <p> The images are burned into Read 's head now : an American flag waving above the wreckage that was the World Trade Center , many American flags draped over the bodies of the dead firefighters pulled from the twisted , smoldering metal . He had nightmares for months after that search-and-rescue mission . <p> That fall , he took the semester off from Temple , worrying his mother because he did not talk much anymore . <p> " He backed away from a lot of family and friends , " Joan Read said . " And he threw himself into rowing . " <p> With Read in the boat , pulling hard and always keeping what he calls the " morale-o-meter " up with his encouraging words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds that year . Last year , it was silver . This June , Read was in the United States four that shocked the favored Canadians and British by winning a World Cup race in Lucerne . This year , Teti said , is Read 's best season yet . <p> Read said a newfound spirituality has played a part in that . He was baptized Lutheran , rarely going to church before Sept. 11 . But on Easter 2002 , he reaffirmed his faith in God and was confirmed in the Catholic Church , moved by the support he was given after Sept. 11 by Catholic friends and the Rev. Thomas Mullelly , the chaplain for the national rowing team and for Princeton . <p> On his confirmation day , Read received a small card from his sponsor , Hank Teti , Mike Teti 's father . On it is his name , the word " Healer " and a Bible verse . <p> Read choked up when he read the card , gently touching the edges as he whispered : " I 've been given strength by someone  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the most compromising positions . I do n't know why . I do n't know why I 've been blessed that way . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Read practicing with his teammate Wyatt Allen , left , on Lake Carnegie near Princeton .
