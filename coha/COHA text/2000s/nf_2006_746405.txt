Investigations of physical self-concept among children have repeatedly shown that boys have higher physical self-concept than girls . Given the masculine nature of physical activity and sport , this result seems reasonable . However , previous studies have not assessed the social phenomenon of gender-typed sports . It stands to reason that because of social stereotyping , boys and girls may experience different physical self-concept in traditionally masculine ( boys ' ) sports or traditionally feminine ( girls ' ) sports . Furthermore , boys and girls who participate in cross-gender typed sports ( e.g. , boys in traditionally girls ' sports and girls in traditionally boys ' sports ) may yield different results regarding physical self-concept . Toward that end , this study examined the physical self-concept of middle-school-aged boys and girls who participated in different gender stereotyped sports . Results indicated that boys and girls experienced different degrees of physical self-concept depending on the type of sport in which they participated . Boys and girls who participated in gender-typed and cross-gendered sports experienced higher physical self-concept than those who participated only in gender-typed sports . Stereotype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making suggestions for future research . <p> Physical activity participation and perceived competence in physical activity has been credited for a number of positive developmental outcomes such as leadership , altruism , and independence ( Larson , 2000 ) . Furthermore , self-concept has been recognized as an important element in positive human development for decades . Physical self-concept is a construct that focuses on perceptions of self within the physical activity domain , Investigations of physical self-concept are important in order to better understand the psychological benefits that participation in physical activity yields . The Physical Self Description Questionnaire ( PSDQ ) ( Marsh , 1994 ) , which measures physical self-concept independent of other domains , is an important research tool is this process . This study used the PSDQ to examine differences in each domain of physical self-concept for girls and boys participating in gender-typed sports ( i.e. , sports deemed socially appropriate for their gender ) , cross-gendered sports ( i.e. , sports deemed socially appropriate for the opposite gender ) . Physical Self-Concept and Gender <p> Research focused on physical self-concept has indicated consistent gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the physical activity and sport arena ( Klomsten , Skaalvik , &; Espnes , 2004 ) . Gender , as Bern ( 1981 ) contended , exists on a continuum of masculine and feminine . Because of its aggressive and highly competitive nature , sport falls on the masculine end of the scale ( Deaux , 1985 ) . Given the social construction of gender and the characteristics associated with " acceptable " gender behavior , the consistent finding that boys have higher physical self-concept than girls is not surprising . <p> As outlined by Marsh ( 1994 ) , physical self-concept is not a unidimensional construct , but consists of several domains or dimensions including coordination , physical activity , body fat , sports competence , global physical self , physical appearance , strength , flexibility , and endurance . Some physical self-concept dimensions are stereotypically masculine traits ( e.g. , sports competence , endurance ) while others are stereotypically feminine traits ( e.g. , flexibility , physical appearance ) . Klomsten et al . ( 2004 ) examined gender differences in the domains of physical self-concept . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , endurance , and strength dimensions ( e.g. , stereotypical masculine characteristics ) and girls to score higher on the flexibility dimension ( e.g. , a stereotypical feminine characteristic ) as assessed by the PSDQ . Interestingly , this was not the case . Boys had higher self-concept than girls in every dimension of the PSDQ with the exception of flexibility , where there was no difference between the sexes . Other studies also have demonstrated relationships between possession of masculine traits and participation in masculine sports and dimensions of physical self-concept such as global self-worth and self-esteem ( Bowker , Gadbois , &; Comock , 2003 ; Rose &; Montemayer , 1994 ) . <p> Investigations of gender differences in physical self-concept have failed to assess the gender stereotype of the sport in which individuals participate . For example , the sample population Klomsten et al . ( 2004 ) examined included competitive and recreational sport participants from an array of sports ( such as basketball , handball , dance , gymnastics , horseback riding , baseball , and football ) . The authors indicate that boys participated more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests failed to take the effects of gender sport stereotypes and social expectation into consideration in regard to participants ' physical self-concept . Despite efforts toward equality in sport opportunities and participation , gender stereotypes in sports persist ( Riemer &; Visio , 2003 ) . <p> Steele and Aronson ( 1995 ) contended that peoples ' behavior and performance is affected by social stereotypes . Because of gender stereotypes in sports , it stands to reason that girls ' and boys ' physical self-concept would differ depending on the sport in which they participate . Moreover , the salience of social stereotyping in sport and the degree to which masculinity plays a part ( i.e. , sports are a domain in which boys and men are encouraged to practice , display , and even develop masculinity ) , the few boys who participate in cross-gendered sports ( i.e. , stereotypically girls ' sports ) will likely have a well-developed and high sense of self because they need to have confidence to go against the norm ( Connell , 2002 ; Messner , 2002 ) . The phenomenon also should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports they too are going against the expected norm of society . The differences may be more apparent for boys because it is more common and socially acceptable for girls to participate in cross-gendered sports than for boys to participate in cross-gendered sports . <p> The purpose of this study was to examine the physical self-concept of boys and girls in gender-typed and cross-gendered sports . Analyses were conducted separately for boys and girls given noted gender differences in physical self-concept . Differences in each domain of physical self-concept were assessed for those who participated in gender-typed sports vs. those who participated in gender-typed and cross-gendered sports . Based on stereotype theory ( Steele &; Aronson , 1995 ) and previous findings of the effects of gender-typing on sport and physical activity participation , it was hypothesized that children who participate in gender-typed and cross-gendered sports would have higher physical self-concept than their counterparts who participated only in gender-typed sports . Method Participants <p> Participants included 202 middle school girls ( n = 93 ) and boys ( n= 108 ) ranging in age from eleven through thirteen . The participating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mean age of girls and boys was 12.5 .08 and 12.7 .08 respectively . Study procedures were reviewed and approved by the Office for Research Protections at the university out of which the research was being conducted . Trained research assistants visited 6th through 8th grade homerooms to introduce the study . The introduction included a synopsis of the goals of the study and what participation in the study involved . Consent forms incorporating background questionnaires for demographic data were mailed home to families within one week of the homeroom visits . Interested students were required to return completed parental consent forms and to complete an assent form in order to participate in the study . Questionnaires were completed during English classes per the request of the administration of the participating school . Measures <p> Sport participation and physical self concept were the primary variables of interest . Information was also obtained on background characteristics ( i.e. , parent education , family income ) , BMI and pubertal status to assess as potential covariates . <p> Sport participation . The types of sports in which adolescents participated were assessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soccer , cheerleading , football ) . A preliminary list of sports was developed and then presented to physical education teachers at the middle school where the data were collected as a means of confirming the appropriateness of the sports included to the sample population . The physical education teachers suggested that two sports ( rollerblading and skateboarding ) be added to the list so as to include sports popular among the student body at the time . For each sport , participants were asked to indicate whether or not they participated in the sport competitively or on a regular basis ( e.g. , three times a week for 30 minutes or more ) currently or within the past year . <p> Physical self-concept . Physical self-concept was measured using the Physical Self-Description Questionnaire ( PSDQ ) ( Marsh , 1994 ) . The PSDQ consists of fifty-four items and is measured on a 6-point scale ranging from ( I ) " false " to ( 6 ) " true . " The scale consists of nine sub-domains posited by Marsh ( 1994 ) as dimensions of physical self-concept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , physical activity ( " I often exercise until I breathe hard " ) , body fat ( " I 'm too fat " ) , sports competence ( " I play sports well " ) , global physical self ( " I 'm happy with my physical self ) , physical appearance ( " I 'm good looking " ) , strength ( " I 'm physically strong " ) , flexibility ( " my body is flexible " ) , and endurance ( " I can run a long way and not get tired " ) . The scales for each sub-domain consist of six items . Internal consistencies for the nine sub-domains were acceptable , ranging from a = .83 ( flexibility ) to a = .93 ( body fat &; sports competence ) . <p> Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . The school nurse collected students ' height ( to the nearest quarter inch ) and weight ( to the nearest .1 or a pound ) as part of the annual protocol for the school . These data were used to calculate BMI ( weight(kg)/height(m)2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated using CDC growth curves ( Kuczmarski , Ogden , Grummer-Strawn , Flegal , Guo , Wei , Mei , Curtin , Roche , Johnson , 2000 ) . Participants were classified as overweight if they had a BMI percentile &gt; 85 . <p> Pubertal Development Scale ( PDS ) . Previous research shows that pubertal development is linked with adolescent 's perceived physical self concept ( O'Dea &; Abraham , 1999 ) . Therefore , stage of pubertal developed was assessed in this study as a potential covariate . Participants completed the Pubertal Development Scale ( PDS ) . The PDS consisted of three items , two of which were the same for boys and girls : growth in height , and changes in skin ( such as the presence of pimples ) . Boys were asked if they had noticed a deepening of their voice , and girls were asked if they had started to menstruate . Reliability and validity of the scale has been established and supported in previous research ( Petersen , Crockett , Richards , &; Boxer , 1988 ; Petersen , Tobin-Richards , &; Boxer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender-typed and cross-gendered sports . Of the twenty-eight sports on the activity checklist , twelve were eliminated from analysis . Ten were eliminated because they had less than fifteen participants ( e.g. , racquetball , field hockey , rowing , ultimate frisbee , biathlon , skiing , sailing , aerobics , ice skating , martial arts ) . Baseball and softball were eliminated because they were categorized as one sport on the questionnaire ( e.g. , baseball/softball ) . The dual categorization of a socially stereotypical masculine sport ( baseball ) and a socially stereotypical feminine sport ( softball ) virtually cancelled out any gender related idiosyncrasies that the sports may have shown . <p> Fourteen of the remaining sports have been investigated in previous research geared toward identifying gender-typed sports ( Colley , Nash , O'Donnell , &; Restorick 1987 ; Koivula , 1995 ; Metheny , 1965 ) . These sports were categorized as feminine ( girls ' ) and masculine ( boys ' ) , and gender neutral according to the results of the previous studies . Four of the sports are classified as boys ' sports : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five are classified as girls ' sports : cheerleading , dance , gymnastics , horseback riding , and baton twirling . The remaining five sports are classified as gender neutral sports : basketball , soccer , track , volleyball , and cycling . Participation profiles of boys and girls in the fourteen sports by category are presented in Table 1 . <p> The final two sports ( i.e. , skateboarding , rollerblading ) were not categorized because they are contemporary sports with little research history to justify categorizing them as gender-based or cross-gendered sports . These sports were added to the list at the suggestion of the physical education teachers of the school where data were collected . <p> Classifying participation in gender-typed and cross-gendered sports . As previously outlined , participants were asked to indicate if they had participated in different sports regularly ( e.g. , 30 minutes or more , three or more times a week ) or on a competitive basis within the last year . Using these data and the classification scheme outlined above , a four category sport participation variable was computed consisting of " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ' sports , " and " both sports . " Individuals who indicated that they had participated only in girls ' sports within the last year were grouped into the " girls ' sports " category , individuals who indicated that they had participated only in boys ' sports within the last year were grouped into the " boys ' sports " category , and individuals who indicated they had participated in both sport types within the last year were grouped into the " both sports " category . The final category , " no sports " , consisted of individuals who indicated that they had not participated in girls ' or boys ' sports within the last year . <p> The cross-gendered and no sport participation categories are not presented in the tables because the groups were too small to have an effect or statistical analysis was impossible . A total of four girls were grouped in the " only boys ' sports " category , and three girls were grouped in the " no sport " category . One boy was grouped in the " only girls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " no sport " category . <p> Statistical analyses . Analyses were conducted using SPSS v. 12.0 for Windows . Demographic characteristics including family income , parents ' education level , as well as participants ' BMI and pubertal status were examined as potential confounding variables . Participation in gender neutral sports may serve as a protective factor for participation in gender-typed or cross-gendered sports and was therefore also examined as a potential confounding variable . In the event that the demographic variables , pubertal development or participation in gender neutral sports was significantly associated with the independent ( sport participation ) and dependent ( physical self-concept ) variables , it was included in analyses as a covariate where appropriate . Results Sample Population <p> The sample population was predominantly non-Hispanic , White ( 97% ) . Over half of the fathers ( 56% ) and almost half of the mothers ( 45% ) of participants had completed some high school or had a high school diploma . Over half ( 57% ) of the sample came from families with a combined income of between $20,000 and $50,000 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were classified as being overweight . Differences in Physical Self-Concept Based on Sport Participation <p> The aim of this study was to assess whether physical self-concept differs for boys and girls who participate in different types of sports based on social stereotypes . Boys and girls were examined separately . Demographic characteristics including parents ' education , family income , BMI , pubertal development , and participation in gender neutral sports were included in analyses to explore their potential as confounding variables . None of the demographic , developmental , or participation characteristics were correlated with the independent and dependent variables . Therefore , the characteristics were not included as covariates in further analyses . <p> Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) was used to assess differences in physical self-concept for girls ( Table 2 ) and boys ( Table 3 ) who participated in gender-typed and cross-gendered sports . The hypothesis guiding the study posited boys and girls who participated in gender-typed and cross-gendered sports would have higher perceived physical self-concept that their counterparts who participated in only gender-typed sports . The hypothesis was partially supported . Because physical self-concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in different sport types in the various dimensions of physical self-concept . <p> Girls who participated in both sport types reported significantly higher perceived strength than girls who participated only in gender-typed ( i.e. , girls ' ) sports ( Table 2 ) . Boys who participated in both sport types experienced higher perceived coordination , physical activity , sports competence , physical appearance , strength , and endurance than boys who participated in only gender-typed ( i.e. , boys ' ) sports ( Table 3 ) . <p> In the case of skateboarding , girls who participated reported higher perceived physical activity ( t=3.61 , p=.002 ) , global physical self ( f=2.92 , p=.008 ) , flexibility ( t=3.34 , p=.003 ) , and endurance ( t=3.10 , p=.003 ) and lower perceived body fat ( t=3.11 , p=.006 ) . There were no differences in perceived physical self-concept among boys who participated in skateboarding and boys who did not participate in skateboarding ( Table 4 ) . <p> Exploratory analyses using t-test were run to assess differences in physical self-concept based on participation in skateboarding and rollerblading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were examined separately . In the case of rollerblading , girls who participated reported significantly higher perceived sports competence , global physical self , flexibility , and endurance than girls who did not participate . There were no differences in perceived physical self-concept among boys who participated in rollerblading and boys who did not participate in rollerblading ( Table 5 ) . Discussion <p> Previous research has shown that boys and girls differ in their physical self-concept , specifically , that boys have higher physical self-concepts than girls in the sport arena . Yet , previous studies have not taken gender-typing of sports into consideration . According to stereotype theory , social stereotypes affect behavior and people will sometimes curb their self-perceptions of competence and activities according to social expectation ( Steele , 1997 ; Steele &; Aronson , 1995 ) . Using stereotype theory as a framework , it was predicted that boys and girls who participate in cross-gendered sports would have higher physical self-concept than boys and girls who participate in gender-typed sports . Results partially supported this hypothesis . Boys and girls who participated in both sport types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls who participated only in gender-typed sports . The number of domains in which this result was significant is more pronounced for boys , who experienced higher physical self-concept in six sub-domains compared to girls who experienced higher physical self-concept in one sub-domain . These findings suggest that links between physical self-concept and sport participation are more complicated than outlined in stereotype theory , and that qualifications to the theory based on gender are needed . In order to fully understand significance of these results , a discussion of gender-typed sports and social stereotypes is in order . <p> Cross-gendered participation puts individuals at risk of stereotype and the stigmas associated with going against the expected social norm ( Schlenker &; Weigold , 1989 ) . Stereotype theory suggests that individuals deal with stereotypes by ( a ) disidentifying with the area in which they may be stereotyped , and ( b ) by developing a coping mechanism to overcome the stereotype ( Major &; Cracker , 1993 ; Major , Spencer , Schmader , Wolfe , l998 ; Steele , 1997 ; Steele &; Aronson , 1995 ) . Disidentification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a domain , or in this case activity , as a means of avoiding the risk of stereotype ( Major &; Crocker , 1993 ; Major et al. , 1998 ; Steele , 1997 ; Steele A Aronson , 1995 ) . Coping on the other hand suggests that an individual finds a mechanism through which to manage the stereotype and participates regardless . The latter is either the result of , or contributes to , a highly developed sense of self and confidence . It stands to reason therefore that individuals who cope with stereotypes and go against the expected norm of society , such as participating in cross-gendered sports and physical activities would also possess higher self-esteem and self-concept than individuals who avoid the risk of being stereotyped by not participating in cross-gender typed sports . Common thought dictates that girls are limited in their participation and are at great risk of stigma if they participate in sport because sport is a traditionally masculine domain . Yet , this thought does not allow for the notion that because of sports ' masculine definition , there is less latitude for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional stereotypes of clothing and colors provide a good example ; girls can more easily wear stereotypically boys ' clothes ( e.g. , pants ) and colors ( e.g. , blue ) than can boys wear stereotypically girls ' clothes ( e.g. , dresses ) and colors ( e.g. , pink ) . The same can be argued of girls in sports . It is more common to see a girl participate in a traditionally boys ' sport , and there are movements toward that end . There is still some risk of being stereotyped as lesbians if girls participate in particularly aggressive sports . However , the risk for girls is not as great as it is for boys . There is less social support for boys to participate in girls ' sports and risk of being labeled as gay is more prominent , thus posing the argument that boys are more limited in their participation than girls ( Cornell , 2002 ; Henderson &; Shaw , 2003 ; Messner , 2002 ) . <p> One of the phenomena at work in the current study may be the inherent masculine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been considered a masculine domain . However , in terms of gender stereotypes , the masculine nature of sport may serve as a detriment to the perceived freedom boys and men have in sport and physical activity . Because of the masculine nature of sport and physical activity , boys and men are expected to develop and display their masculine qualities in sport and are at risk of stereotype if they go against the expectation ( Connell , 2002 ; Henderson &; Shaw , 2003 ; Messner , 2002 ) . The fact that girls did not show differences in physical self-concept based on the type of sport they participated in speaks to the notion that girls and women are given more social latitude in their participation ( Connell , 2002 ; Henderson &; Shaw , 2003 ; Messner , 2002 ) . Hence , girls may not experience different levels of physical self-concept in different types of sports . The lack of variation may exist because masculine behaviors are more highly valued in society ( Czisma , Wittig , &; Schurr , 1988 ; Koivula , 1995 ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward equality in sport . In addition , girls may simply not be exposed to the same complications that boys are within the sport domain . Girls may experience high physical self-concept by participating in any capacity or sport type , whereas boys may be faced with more sensitivity to the social , emotional , and mental nuances participation in different sports may yield . <p> The results of this study are an interesting commentary on the links between social stereotypes of gender and sport participation ; boys and girls who go against the grain of social stereotype and participate in cross-gendered in addition to gender-typed sports have a higher physical self-concept than those who participate only in gender-typed sports . <p> The results for the exploratory analyses of skateboarding and rollerblading also provide interesting insight . Contrary to the results of the other sports , girls who participated in these two sports experienced higher physical self-concept in a number of sub-domains , however boys who participated did not experience the same outcome . Considering the paucity of research on these two sports in regard to gender-typed participation and gender stereotypes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Participation in rollerblading and skateboarding yielded higher physical self-concept across more domains than any other sport type participation for girls . Other results from this study suggested that participants in cross-gendered sports experience higher physical self-concept than their colleagues who do not participate in cross-gendered sports . As indicated by this exploratory test , it is conceivable that skateboarding and rollerblading ( labeled here as new sports ) may be considered boys ' sports by the population , therefore affording the girls who participate in them to have a high sense of physical self . The data presented here are but an introduction to what future research may yield . Further research investigating the gender stereotypes and physical self-concept of participants in these sports is warranted . <p> A limitation to the study is its cross sectional nature , which limits the ability to predict any patterns or long term relationships between sport participation and physical self-concept . However , it poses intriguing potential for longitudinal research investigating the outcomes gleaned from participating in sports of all kinds , despite prevalent social constructions of " appropriate " participation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students sought parent or guardian consent and ultimately participated . Students least likely to participate in a study assessing their physical activity participation may be those who do not participate in sports at all and may be in some way self-conscious of their lack of participation . Stereotype theory would propose that students fitting this description have disidentified or disassociated from physical activity . Specifically , such students do not consider themselves active , and had no interest in participating in a study investigating physical activity . The phenomenon of disidentification has been discussed in stereotype research , but few investigations have been conducted to assess how and why people disidentify from characteristics , in this case being active . The data provided by longitudinal studies and by studies investigating disidentification can be used by professionals and educators to develop programs to introduce adolescents to sports and physical activities that may otherwise be out of their realm of consideration . <p> In conclusion , the key findings from this study were that boys and girls who participate in cross-gendered and gender-typed sports experience higher physical self-concept than boys and girls who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will aid in further understanding the benefits of participation , in particular the benefits yielded by participating in sports beyond the scope of social gender construction . The strengths of this study include the highlight that the results put on the strong character requirements placed upon children and adolescents to overcome persistent and prevalent social stereotypes in sport . Without a strong sense of physical self-concept , these results suggest that children and adolescents are apt to limit to their participation only to those sports deemed socially " appropriate " to their gender . Yet , children and adolescents benefit most from having a variety of opportunities open to them for self exploration and self-concept development ( Larson , 2000 ) . According to the results from this study , this is particularly true for boys , a finding that may be attributed to the masculine nature of sports . Until social stereotypes in sports are overcome , it is important to consider them as a confounding factor in sport behavior research . Table 1 .
