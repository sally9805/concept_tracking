Prologue ? Decoration Day , 1899 // His father and sister had gone to Woodland Cemetery to plant flowers at the grave of his mother . His younger brother was busy elsewhere . It was a holiday , and the house was quiet . He could take care of the letter he had been meaning to write . // He sat , took out paper and pen , and wrote : // The Smithsonian Institution Washington . // Dear Sirs : // I have been interested in the problem of mechanical and human flight ever since as a boy I constructed a number of bats of various sizes .... My observations since have only convinced me more firmly that human flight is possible and practicable . It is only a question of knowledge and skill as in all acrobatic feats . // He was thirty-two years old and unmarried . He was lean and bald . His lips were thin and he usually held them tightly shut ; he may have been self-conscious about his teeth , which had been smashed in a hockey game years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outright homeliness . Ten years later , when he was one of the most famous men in the world , reporters had trouble getting him to say much about himself . So they remarked on his eyes as indicative of the character within . " This man is strange and cold , " one said , " but of a coldness that is smiling and sympathetic .... The countenance is remarkable , curious - the head that of a bird , long and bony , and with a long nose ... the eye is a superb blue-gray , with tints of gold that bespeak an ardent flame . " He was a shrewd observer of people and of nature . Yet he once told his sister that " my imagination pictures things more vividly than my eyes . " // The subject of his letter was not the sort of thing he would mention casually to a neighbor . On this block of Hawthorn Street , on the west side of Dayton , Ohio , the houses stood so close together you could name the song somebody was playing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was playing . Any news traveled fast , and the news that somebody hoped to fly like a bird would travel faster than usual . Aspirations here tended toward the sensible . The neighbors included four carpenters , two day laborers , a machinist , a printer , a motorman , a market vendor , an insurance salesman , three widows , and two clergymen . One of the clergymen was the young man 's father - quite a prominent man , a bishop of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ , a stout widower who kept house with his schoolteacher daughter and two of his four grown sons . Their home was number 7 , second from the corner of Hawthorn and West Fourth . // " When I saw this house , " a visitor said later , " I felt its pathetic preeminence in a street of meager homes . " It was narrow but it extended way back on the lot , with white clapboards and green shutters . At the front was the parlor , with a slant-top writing desk ; a cherrywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settee . In back of the parlor was the sitting room , dominated by a tall cherry bookcase , its contents suggesting a family of enthusiastic readers with broad interests , from Charles Dickens and James Fenimore Cooper to a six-volume History of France and Charles Darwin 's Origin of Species . Next came a spacious dining room , with a long sideboard , a drop-leaf table , and six walnut chairs . At the rear of the house was the kitchen . Upstairs there were four small bedrooms . Out in back was a " summer kitchen " - a detached shed - and an outhouse . Along the front and left side of the house there was a long porch . The young man and his brother had built it in 1892 . They kept it simple , leaving off the usual gingerbread trim . // The young man continued his letter : // Birds are the most perfectly trained gymnasts in the world and are specially well fitted for their work , and it may be that man will never equal them , but no one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can doubt that feats are performed which require three or four times the effort required in ordinary flight . I believe that simple flight at least is possible to man and that the experiments and investigations of a large number of independent workers will result in the accumulation of information and knowledge and skill which will finally lead to accomplished flight . // He once remarked that for a person endowed with greater gifts than others , but lacking in the push needed for conventional success , there was " always the danger " that he would " retire into the first corner he falls into and remain there all his life . " // This is what had happened to him , and the letter was part of his effort to get out of his corner . He possessed extraordinary gifts . Yet he had lived more than half the average span of an American man of his time without doing or making anything he could call his own . He lived in his father 's house . The woman in his life was his sister . The children he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his time to a storefront business without caring for business or money . His only advanced education had come from his father 's books . He had put his powerful mind to work in only one cause - an obscure church controversy , also his father 's . But he did not even have his father 's faith . // He was " an enthusiast , " he wrote : // ... but not a crank in the sense that I have some pet theories as to the proper construction of a flying machine ... I am about to begin a systematic study of the subject in preparation for practical work to which I expect to devote what time I can spare from my regular business . I wish to obtain such papers as the Smithsonian Institution has published on this subject , and if possible a list of other works in print in the English language ... I wish to avail myself of all that is already known and then if possible add my mite to help on the future worker who will attain final success . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publications but if you will inform me of the cost I will remit the price . // Yours truly , Wilbur Wright // By June 1 , traveling by rail , the letter arrived in Washington , where it was carried to the turreted , red-sandstone headquarters of the Smithsonian Institution , on the southern edge of the long green known then as Smithsonian Park . There the letter was opened , sorted with others of its type , and taken through echoing halls to the office of Richard Rathbun , second in command at the Smithsonian , whose duties included the oversight of the Institution 's correspondence with scholars , scientists , and the merely curious in every part of the world . // Rathbun , an expert on marine invertebrates , handled many such inquiries each week . Like Wilbur Wright , people everywhere regarded the Smithsonian as a fountainhead of scientific and cultural information , much of it published in the Institution 's own periodicals . A man once wrote to ask for all Smithsonian publications on geology , biology , botany , the National Museum , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Zoological Park , the Astrophysical Observatory , " and any other interesting subjects . " He was told that compliance with his request would require the shipment of several thousand volumes . With the financial support of the U.S. Congress and a host of private benefactors , the Smithsonian was the best-endowed , most prestigious institution of science , culture , and learning in the entire nation . Its exhibits , repositories , storehouses , laboratories , and libraries were known throughout the world , and all of these existed to fulfill the terms of the 1846 will of the Institution 's founding benefactor , the Englishman James Smithson , who had called for an American institution to foster " the increase &amp; diffusion of knowledge . " Every legitimate question was to receive a careful answer . So people wrote by the hundreds every year . // The letter from Dayton would have occasioned no special notice in Rathbun 's office but for one salient characteristic . It raised the question of mechanical flight . This was a topic of consuming interest to the fourth secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature and prestige , Langley was the most prominent scientist in the United States . His best friend was Alexander Graham Bell , the inventor of the telephone . Langley was a frequent guest at the White House . He dined regularly with the historian Henry Adams , grandson and great-grandson of presidents ; and John Hay , who had been personal secretary to Abraham Lincoln and was now secretary of state . Langley corresponded with the likes of Rudyard Kipling and the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce ; as a young man he had listened for hours to the philosophical discourses of the great British historian Thomas Carlyle . // In the entire world only a handful of men with any standing in science had suggested that human flight was possible . Langley not only had said so , but had done more than anyone else to bring the possibility within reach . He was now the leading flight experimenter in the world , and the pursuit of human flight had become the passion of his life . // Wilbur Wright would have to contend with the doubts of his neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-consciously , was assailing the arguments of Sir Isaac Newton and several of the leading mathematicians and physicists of the day , who said basic laws of logic and physics rendered human flight highly unlikely if not utterly impossible . Wright hoped to " add my mite " in the search for a solution . Langley aspired to join the pantheon of history 's greatest scientists . // To build his case , Langley had undertaken a long series of experiments in aerodynamics that culminated in 1896 with the flights of two substantial flying machines - unmanned - over the Potomac River . He called them " aerodromes , " his own coinage from the Greek , meaning " air runner . " // Among the handful who saw the first unmanned flight of a Langley aerodrome was Alexander Graham Bell , who captured the only photographs of the event . That evening he jotted a note to Langley - " I shall count this day as one of the most memorable of my life " - and to the editor of Science he sent a resounding endorsement of the secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments without being convinced that the practicability of mechanical flight had been demonstrated . " Certainly Bell was convinced , and he went back to his own flight experiments with new zeal . // " A ' flying-machine , ' so long a type for ridicule , has really flown , " Langley declared . " It has demonstrated its practicability in the only satisfactory way - by actually flying , and by doing this again and again , under conditions which leave no doubt . " As Langley 's engineer later put it , the model aerodromes known as No. 5 and No. 6 were " the only things of human construction that had ever really flown for any considerable distance . " // Now , three years later , with all the resources of the Smithsonian at his command , and the largest appropriation for research ever granted by the U.S. War Department , Langley was directing an entire staff in the design and construction of a much larger machine - a machine that would carry a man . President William McKinley had taken an interest in the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had played a key role in assuring the funding . Langley expected to conduct the first trials by the end of the year . // If the secretary had been in his office that day , Richard Rathbun might have mentioned the carefully written and well-informed request for information on mechanical flight . But Langley was in Europe . He went abroad nearly every summer , to meet with his international peers in the world of science ; to raise the Smithsonian 's profile as an institution of world rank ; and to indulge his own love for the sites of European high culture . // So Rathbun sent back a brief reply to Dayton with " a list of works relating to aerial navigation , which will probably best meet your needs , " plus several Smithsonian pamphlets . // Wilbur Wright 's letter was filed and forgotten . //
