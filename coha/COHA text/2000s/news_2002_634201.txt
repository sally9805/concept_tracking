<p> With income tax time coming and apartment leases running out , a lot of apartment dwellers are wondering if they could make the big jump to home ownership . <p> But , buying that first home is too important to be left to someone who has never done it before . <p> First-time buyers need to get some help . And , there is plenty of advice out there for them  --  shelves of books , Internet Web sites and even your Uncle Sid . <p> They can help , but they ca n't replace the information provided by an experienced professional who can fit their finances to the proper mortgage , according to Bob Shield , senior vice president of Draper &; Kramer Mortgage Corp . <p> " It 's really , really very difficult to communicate all of the options for a first-time buyer , without sitting down with them and going over all of their possibilities , " Shield said . " You have everything from FHA  --  which has traditionally been the first-time mortgage agency  --  to the agencies , Fannie Mae and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a lot of down payment assistance programs , " from various sources , including the City of Chicago , the State of Illinois , private agencies and even some individual suburbs , he said . <p> Computers have led to automated underwriting , which means that a lender or seller can plug in the details of the deal and the potential buyer 's financial situation , and determine whether he or she can qualify for a mortgage , he said . <p> " There is an awful lot of education on the Web today , " Shield said . " It 's a great place for a person to learn . But , I think sitting down with a quality lender and letting them talk to them is probably the best choice . " <p> On real estate related Web sites , " they can go in and calculate their payments , see what interest rates are , and do a rent-versus-buy analysis , " he said . <p> But computer programs are only as good , or bad , as the information plugged into them . Incorrect , insufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , he said . <p> " Bad credit is the No. 1 reason why people do n't get a mortgage , " he said . " We are seeing more and more people who have too much revolving debt . So , we counsel people to get rid of those credit cards . Do n't buy a new car right away . Get into the new house for a couple years and build up a nest egg . " <p> The bulk of first-time buyers for Draper &; Kramer are young couples , he said . But many are unmarried couples or " suddenly singles " because of death or divorce . <p> The Web site for Draper &; Kramer Mortgage Corp. , ( **27;1296;TOOLONG ) includes information for first-time buyers , mortgage calculators and a helpful glossary of terms from " adjustable-rate mortgage " to " underwriting . " <p> Many major builders have their own mortgage companies or affiliates . For suburban builder Montalbano Homes , it is Diamond Mortgage LLC ( diamondmortgage.com ) . <p> Why use the builder 's company ? <p> " We do tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mark Malouf , chief operating office of Montalbano . <p> " But , we think we can have better management over the mortgage process , " he said . " We do n't want the mortgage process to become the deal killer . We shop for our customers to get the best rate because of our volume . " <p> Buyers are assigned a representative who is available 24 hours a day via pagers , he said . <p> " A lot of consumers have done some research on the computer , " he said . " They are more educated than ever before in terms of the dollar amount they qualify for . Then , they go out and find the house that fits the amount they can afford . " <p> Montalbano has single-family developments in Lockport , Joliet , Algonquin and Crest Hill . The builder 's town-house developments are in Joliet and Lockport . Single-family prices start at about $150,000 and town houses in the $120,000s . <p> Many of the first-time buyers are forgoing upgrades and options to use that money to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most desirable location , Malouf said . <p> Many of the customers are referred by friends or family who bought through Diamond , he said . <p> Buyers can get preapproved for a mortgage of a specific amount before they go shopping , explained Tom Ward , president of Majestic Mortgage Corp. , which serves the Chicago area and nearby Wisconsin . <p> But , getting preapproval on the computer alone can have its problems for the first-timer , Ward explained . If the buyer provides incorrect or incomplete information , the approval can fall through later . <p> " There is preapproval with documentation and preapproval without documentation , " he said . " What is hurting some people is approval without documentation . " <p> The mortgage is contingent on all of the information being flaw free , he said . But , problems can pop up . <p> Buyers might think they have a spotless credit rating , he said . But , unless they have checked their report lately , there could be mistakes on it . <p> The credit problems of people with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Senior 's missed payments can get transposed to Junior 's file , he said . Those mistakes can be corrected , but it takes time , Ward said . <p> " We do the approval process fact-to-face , " Ward said . " So you have the documentation in hand and we can talk to both parties " he added . <p> Majestic 's Web site ( www. majestic-mortgage.com ) includes a check list of the financial records required for a proper approval , including : paycheck stubs for the past 30 days , W2s and income tax forms for the past 2 years and statements from any savings accounts , IRAs , 401(k)s , CDs , stocks , bonds or other forms of savings or investments . <p> CTX Mortgage Co. is the " second-largest , non-bank-affiliated mortgage originator in the nation , " and part of the big Centex Corp. , which includes Centex Homes , one of the area 's Top 10 home builders . <p> Dealing with a professional is essential for the home mortgage process , especially for the first-time purchaser , said Bill Randall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet and media sources , people have enough information to get themselves into trouble , " he said . " Information is not knowledge . Often , they will ask the right questions , but they do n't really understand the process . " <p> A recent survey , by a national mortgage publication , found that " less than 5 percent of all loans that originated on the Internet , ever make it to closing , " Randall said . " I think that 's because you do n't have the personal touch . " <p> " We want that customer for life , " Randall said . " We want to take care of the customer . When there 's a home improvement loan , refinancing , move up or move down , you want to be the first person they call . " <p> Some of today 's " first-time " buyers have owned homes before , Randall explained , such as a divorced woman , whose husband took care of those details . Other legal questions arise with the growing number of unmarried couples , including same-sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The mortgage rules keep changing , and the professionals are there to try to keep up with them , he said . <p> " I tell our loan officers and sales people to get face-to-face as quickly as they can , " he said . <p> " It 's a counseling session . It 's a learning process . " <p> Finding out if one qualifies for a mortgage and for how much need not be a complicated or time-consuming process , Randall said . Part of it can be handled over the telephone , with a personal meeting later . Or , it can all be done in person , he said . The whole process should take about an hour and a half , if the buyer has all of the proper documents . <p> The CTX Web site ( www.ctxmort.com ) includes a comprehensive " financial calculator " section that covers 18 different areas including standard mortgages , adjustable-rate loans , 15-year vs. 30-year terms , down payments , tax savings and closing costs . <p> Homeowners get a big income tax break compared with renters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compiled by Majestic Mortgage Corp . for the purchaser of a $135,000 home with a 30-year FHA mortgage at 7 percent . <p> During the first year , the purchaser will pay about $9,406.56 in interest and about $3,375 in property taxes , both of which can be deducted from the owner 's gross income . <p> But the total tax savings would be $3,578.84 , or $298.24 a month . The total payment on this mortgage , taxes and insurance is $1,298.64 .
