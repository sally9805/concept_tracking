( he transforms into Sergeant Hing ) : I was born and raised here.My family is , uh , third generation.My grandparents moved here in the early nineteen hundreds.We 've had basically three , well , my daughter makes it fourth generation.Quite a while . It 's a good place to live . Good people  --  lots of space.Now , all the towns in southern Wyoming are laid out and spaced because of the railroad came through.It was how far they could go before having to refuel and rewater.And , uh , Laramie was a major stopping point.That 's why the towns are spaced so far apart.We 're one of the largest states in the country , and the least populated . p. 3 REBECCA HILLIKER There 's so much space between people and towns here , so much time for reflection . NARRATOR Rebecca Hilliker , head of the theater department at the University of Wyoming : REBECCA HILLIKER You have an opportunity to be happy in your life here . I found that people here were nicer than in the Midwest , where I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun was shining . And it shines a lot here . SERGEANT HING What you have is , you have your old-time traditional-type ranchers , they 've been here forever  --  Laramie 's been the hub of where they come for their supplies and stuff like that . EILEEN ENGEN Stewardship is one thing all our ancestors taught us . NARRATOR Eileen Engen , rancher : EILEEN ENGEN If you do n't take care of the land , then you ruin it and you lose your living . So you first of all have to take care of your land and do everything you can to improve it . DOC O'CONNOR I love it here . NARRATOR Doc O'Connor , limousine driver : DOC O'CONNOR You could n't put me back in that mess out there back east . Best thing about it is the climate . The cold , the wind . They say the Wyoming wind 'll drive a man insane . But you know what ? It do n't bother me . Well , some of the times it bothers me . But most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uh , the university population . PHILIP DUBOIS I moved here after living in a couple of big cities . NARRATOR Philip Dubois , president of the University of Wyoming : PHILIP DUBOIS I loved it there . But you 'd have to be out of your mind to let your kids out after dark . And here , in the summertime , my kids play out at night till eleven and I do n't think twice about it . SERGEANT HING And then you have the people who live in Laramie , basically . ZACKIE SALMON I moved here from rural Texas . NARRATOR Zackie Salmon , Laramie resident : ZACKIE SALMON Now , in Laramie , if you do n't know a person , you will definitely know someone they know . So it can only be one degree removed at most . And for me  --  I love it ! I mean , I love to go to the grocery store ' cause I get to visit with four or five or six people every time I go . And I do n't really mind people knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , my business is basically good . DOC O'CONNOR I like the trains , too . They do n't bother me . Well , some of the times they bother me , but most times they do n't . Even though one goes by every thirteen minutes out where I live . p. 5 NARRATOR Doc actually lives up in Bossler . But everybody in Laramie knows him . He 's also not really a doctor . DOC O'CONNOR They used to carry cattle them trains . Now all they carry is diapers and cars . APRIL SILVA I grew up in Cody , Wyoming . NARRATOR April Silva , university student : APRIL SILVA Laramie is better than where I grew up . I 'll give it that . SERGEANT HING It 's a good place to live . Good people , lots of space . Now , when the incident happened with that boy , a lot of press people came here . And one time some of them followed me out to the crime scene . And uh , well , it was a beautiful day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky was that blue that , uh you know , you 'll never be able to paint , it 's just sky blue  --  it 's just gorgeous . And the mountains in the background and a little snow on ' em , and this one reporter , uh , lady person , that was out there , she said NEWSPERSON Well , who found the boy , who was out here anyway ? SERGEANT HING And I said , " Well , this is a really popular area for people to run , and mountain biking 's really big out here , horseback riding , it 's just , well , it 's close to town . " And she looked at me and she said : p. 6 NEWSPERSON Who in the hell would want to run out here ? SERGEANT HING And I 'm thinking , " Lady , you 're just missing the point . " You know , all you got to do is turn around , see the mountains , smell the air , listen to the birds , just take in what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story . I did n't feel judged , I felt that they were stupid . They 're , they 're missing the point  --  they 're just missing the whole point . JEDADIAH SCHULTZ It 's hard to talk about Laramie now , to tell you what Laramie is , for us . NARRATOR Jedadiah Schultz : JEDADIAH SCHULTZ If you would have asked me before , I would have told you Laramie is a beautiful town , secluded enough that you can have your own identity . A town with a strong sense of community  --  everyone knows everyone . A town with a personality that most larger cities are stripped of . Now , after Matthew , I would say that Laramie is a town defined by an accident , a crime . We 've become Waco , we 've become Jasper . We 're a noun , a definition , a sign . We may be able to get rid of that but it will sure take a while . p. 7 Act 1 , Scene 2 : Moment : Journal Entries MOMENT : JOURNAL ENTRIES NARRATOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ANDY PARIS Moiss called saying he had an idea for his next theater project . But there was a somberness to his voice , so I asked what it was all about and he told me he wanted to do a piece about what 's happening in Wyoming . NARRATOR Stephen Belber : STEPHEN BELBER Leigh told me the company was thinking of going out to Laramie to conduct interviews and that they wanted me to come . But I 'm hesitant . I have no real interest in prying into a town 's unraveling . NARRATOR Amanda Gronich : AMANDA GRONICH I 've never done anything like this in my life . How do you get people to talk to you ? What do you ask ? NARRATOR Moiss Kaufman : MOIS&amp;EACUTE ; S KAUFMAN The company has agreed that we should go to Laramie for a week and interview people.Am a bit afraid about taking ten people in a trip of this nature . Must make some safety rules . No one works alone . Everyone carries cell phones . Have made some preliminary contacts with Rebecca Hilliker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyoming . She is hosting a party for us our first night in Laramie and has promised to introduce us to possible interviewees. p. 8 Act 1 , Scene 3 : Moment : Rebecca Hilliker MOMENT : REBECCA HILLIKER REBECCA HILLIKER I must tell you that when I first heard that you were thinking of coming here , when you first called me , I wanted to say , You 've just kicked me in the stomach . Why are you doing this to me ? But then I thought , That 's stupid , you 're not doing this to me . And , more important , I thought about it and decided that we 've had so much negative closure on this whole thing . And the students really need to talk . When this happened they started talking about it , and then the media descended and all dialogue stopped.You know , I really love my students because they are free thinkers . And you may not like what they have to say , and you may not like their opinions , because they can be very redneck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there 's an excitement here , there 's a dynamic here with my students that I never had when I was in the Midwest or in North Dakota , because there , there was so much Puritanism that dictated how people looked at the world that a lot of times they did n't have an opinion , you could n't get them to express an opinion . And , quite honestly , I 'd rather have opinions that I do n't like  --  and have that dynamic in education.There 's a student I think you should talk to . His name is Jedadiah Schultz . p. 9 Act 1 , Scene 4 : Moment : Angels in America MOMENT : ANGELS IN AMERICA JEDADIAH SCHULTZ I 've lived in Wyoming my whole life . The family has been in Wyoming , well for generations . Now when it came time to go to college , my parents ca n't  --  could n't afford to send me to college . I wanted to study theater . And I knew that if I was going to go to college I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uh , they have this competition each year , this Wyoming state high school competition . And I knew that if I did n't take first place in , uh , duets that I was n't gon na get a scholarship . So I went to the theater department of the university looking for good scenes , and I asked one of the professors  --  I was like , " I need  --  I need a killer scene , " and he was like , " Here you go , this is it . " And it was from Angels in America.So I read it and I knew that I could win best scene if I did a good enough job.And when the time came I told my mom and dad so that they would come to the competition . Now you have to understand , my parents go to everything  --  every ball game , every hockey game  --  everything I 've ever done.And they brought me into their room and told me that if I did that scene , that they would not come to see me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that homosexuality is wrong  --  they felt that strongly about it that they did n't want to come see their son do probably the most important thing he 'd done to that point in his life . And I did n't know what to do. I had never , ever gone against my parents ' wishes . So I was kind of worried about it . But I decided to do it.And all I can remember about the competition is that when we were done , me and my scene partner , we came up to each other and we shook hands and there was a standing ovation.Oh , man , it was amazing ! And we took first place and we won . And that 's how come I can afford to be here at the university , because of that scene . It was one of the best moments of my life . And my parents were n't there . And to this day , that was the one thing that my parents did n't see me do . And thinking back on it , I think , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ? ' Cause I 'm not gay . So why did I do it ? And I guess the only honest answer I can give is that , well ( he chuckles ) I wanted to win . It was such a good scene ; it was like the best scene ! Do you know Mr. Kushner ? Maybe you can tell him . p. 10 p. 11 Act 1 , Scene 5 : Moment : Journal Entries MOMENT : JOURNAL ENTRIES NARRATOR Company member Greg Pierotti : GREG PIEROTTI We arrived today in the Denver Airport and drove to Laramie . The moment we crossed the Wyoming border I swear I saw a herd of buffalo . Also , I thought it was strange that the Wyoming sign said : WYOMING  --  LIKE NO PLACE ON EARTH instead of WYOMING  --  LIKE NO PLACE ELSE ON EARTH . NARRATOR Company member Leigh Fondakowski : LEIGH FONDAKOWSKI I stopped at a local inn for a bite to eat . And my waitress said to me : WAITRESS Hi , my name is Debbie . I was born in nineteen fifty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are a lot of us around , but I promise that I wo n't slap you if you leave your elbows on the table . MOIS&amp;EACUTE ; S KAUFMAN Today Leigh tried to explain to me to no avail what chicken fried steak was . WAITRESS Now , are you from Wyoming ? Or are you just passing through ? LEIGH FONDAKOWSKI We 're just passing through . NARRATOR Company member Barbara Pitts : BARBARA PITTS We arrived in Laramie tonight . Just past the WELCOME TO LARAMIE sign  --  POPULATION 26,687  --  the first thing to greet us was Wal-Mart . In the dark , we could be on any main drag in America  --  fast-food chains , gas stations . But as we drove into the downtown area by the railroad tracks , the buildings still look like a turn-of-the-century western town . Oh , and as we passed the University Inn , on the sign where amenities such as heated pool or cable TV are usually touted , it said : HATE IS NOT A LARAMIE VALUE . p. 12 NARRATOR Greg Pierotti : p. 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marge MOMENT : ALISON AND MARGE GREG PIEROTTI I met today with two longtime Laramie residents , Alison Mears and Marge Murray , two social service workers who taught me a thing or two . ALISON MEARS Well , what Larimie used to be like when Marge was growing up , well , it was mostly rural . MARGE MURRAY Yeah , it was . I enjoyed it , you know . My kids all had horses . ALISON MEARS Well , there was more land , I mean , you could keep your pet cow . Your horse . Your little chickens . You know , just have your little bit of acreage . MARGE MURRAY Yeah , I could run around the house in my all togethers , do the housework while the kids were in school . And nobody could see me . And if they got that close ALISON MEARS Well , then that 's their problem . MARGE MURRAY Yeah . GREG PIEROTTI I just want to make sure I got the expression right : in your all togethers ? MARGE MURRAY Well , yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how 's he gon na use that in his play ? p. 14 GREG PIEROTTI So this was a big ranching town ? ALISON MEARS Oh , not just ranching , this was a big railroad town at one time . Before they moved everything to Cheyenne and Green River and Omaha . So now , well , it 's just a drive-through spot for the railroad  --  because even , what was it , in the fifties ? Well , they had one big roundhouse , and they had such a shop they could build a complete engine . MARGE MURRAY They did , my mom worked there . GREG PIEROTTI Your mom worked in a roundhouse ? MARGE MURRAY Yep . She washed engines . Her name was Minnie . We used to , you know , sing that song for her , you know that song . GREG PIEROTTI What song ? MARGE MURRAY " Run for the roundhouse , Minnie , they ca n't corner you there . " ( They crack up . ) ALISON MEARS But I 'll tell you , Wyoming is bad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big high whoop-de-do jobs . But Wyoming , unless you 're a professional , well , the bulk of the people are working minimum-wage jobs . MARGE MURRAY Yeah , I 've been either in the service industry or bartending most of my life . Now I know everybody in town . p. 15 ALISON MEARS And she does . MARGE MURRAY And I do . Now that I 'll tell ya , here in Laramie there is a difference and there always has been . What it is is a class distinction . It 's about the well-educated and the ones that are not . And the educated do n't understand why the ones that are not do n't get educated . That 's why I told you before my kids had to fight because their mother was a bartender . Never mind I was the best damn bartender in town . ALISON MEARS And she was . MARGE MURRAY That 's not bragging , that 's fact . ALISON MEARS But here in Laramie , if it were n't for the university , we 'd just be S.O.L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do I have to say it ? Well , it 's shit outta luck . ( She cracks up . ) Oh Lordy , you 've got that on your tape . Boy , you are getting an education today . GREG PIEROTTI Yeah , I guess I am . So , let me just ask you  --  what was your response when this happened to Matthew Shepard ? MARGE MURRAY Well , I 've been close enough to the case to know many of the people . I have a daughter that 's on the Sheriff 's Department.As far as the gay issue , I do n't give a damn one way or the other as long as they do n't bother me . And even if they did , I 'd just say no thank you . And that 's the attitude of most of the Laramie population . They might poke one , if they were in a bar situation , you know , they had been drinking , they might actually smack one in the mouth , but then they 'd just walk away . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't swing that way , " and whistle on about their business . Laramie is live and let live . p. 16 ALISON MEARS I 'd say that Marge probably knows a lot more except she 's even willing to say , and we have to respect her for that . MARGE MURRAY Well , uh , where are you going with this story ? GREG PIEROTTI Oh , well , we still have n't decided . When we 've finished , we are going to try to bring it around to Laramie . MARGE MURRAY Okay , then , there are parts I wo n't tell you . p. 17 Act 1 , Scene 7 : Moment : Matthew MOMENT : MATTHEW NARRATOR Company member Andy Paris : ANDY PARIS Today , for the first time , we met someone who actually knew Matthew Shepard . Trish Steger , owner of a shop in town , referred to him as Matt . TRISH STEGER Matt used to come into my shop  --  that 's how I knew him . ANDY PARIS It was the first time I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he go by Matt to everyone ? DOC O'CONNOR Well , on the second of October , I get a phone call about , uh , ten after seven . NARRATOR Doc O'Connor : DOC O'CONNOR It was Matthew Shepard . And he said , " Can you pick me up at the corner of Third and Grand ? " So , anyhow , I pull up to the corner , to see who Matthew Shepard , you know . It 's a little guy , about five-two , soakin ' wet , I betcha ninety-seven pounds tops . They say he weighed a hundred and ten , but I would n't believe it . They also said he was five-five in the newspapers , but this man , he was really only about five-two , maybe five-one . So he walks up the window  --  I 'm gon na try and go in steps so you can better understand the principle of this man . So he walks up to the window , and I say , " Are you Matthew Shepard ? " And he says , " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to call me Matthew , or Mr. Shepard . I do n't want you to call me anything . My name is Matt . And I want you to know , I am gay and we 're going to go to a gay bar . Do you have a problem with that ? " And I said , " How 're you payin ' ? " The fact is Laramie does n't have any gay bars and for that matter neither does Wyoming so he was hiring me to take him to Fort Collins , Colorado , about an hour away.Matt was a blunt little shit , you know what I 'm sayin ' ? But I liked him ' cause he was straightforward , you see what I 'm saying ? Maybe gay but straightforward , you see what I 'm saying ? p. 18 TRISH STEGER I do n't know , you know , how does any one person ever tell about another ? You really should talk to my sister Romaine . She was a very close friend of Matthew 's . ROMAINE PATTERSON We never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we called him Choo-choo . You know , because we used to call him Mattchew , and then we just called him Choo-choo.And whenever I think of Matthew , I always think of his incredible beaming smile . I mean , he 'd walk in and he 'd be like ( demonstrates ) you know , and he 'd smile at everyone he just made you feel great . And he  --  would like stare people down in the coffee shop ' cause he always wanted to sit on the end seat so that he could talk to me while I was working . And if someone was sitting in that seat , he would just sit there and stare at them . Until they left . And then he would claim his spot.But Matthew definitely had a political side to him . I mean , he really wanted to get into political affairs that 's all his big interest was , was watching CNN and MSNBC , I mean , that 's the only TV station I ever saw his TV tuned in to . He was just really smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonsense things So , he moves to Laramie to go to school . JON PEACOCK Matthew was very shy when he first came in. p. 19 NARRATOR Jon Peacock , Matthew Shepard 's academic adviser : JON PEACOCK To the point of being somewhat mousy I 'd almost say . He was having some difficulties adjusting , but this was home for him and he made that quite clear . And so his mousiness , his shyness gave way to a person who was excited about this track that he was going to embark on . He was just figuring out wanting to work on human rights , how he was going to do that . And when that happens this person begins to bloom a little bit . He was starting to say , " Wow , there are opportunities here . There are things I can do in this world . I can be important . " ROMAINE PATTERSON I did hear from Matthew about forty-eight hours before his attack . And he told me that he had joined the gay and lesbian group on campus , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting ready for Pride Week and whatnot . I mean , he was totally stoked about school  --  yeah , he was really happy about being there . JON PEACOCK And in retrospect  --  and I can only say this in retrospect of course  --  I think that 's where he was heading , towards human rights . Which only adds to the irony and tragedy of this . p. 20 Act 1 , Scene 8 : Moment : Who 's Getting What ? MOMENT : WHO 'S GETTING WHAT ? DOC O'CONNOR Let me tell you something else here . There 's more gay people in Wyoming than meets the eye . I know , I know for a fact . They 're not particularly , ah , the whattayou call them , the queens , the gay people , queens , you know , runaround faggot-type people . No , they 're the ones that throw bails of hay , jump on horses , brand ' em , and kick ass , you see what I 'm saying ? As I always say , Do n't fuck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your fucking ass , but that 's not the point of what I 'm trying to say . ' Cause I know a lot of gay people in Wyoming , I know a lot of people period . I 've been lived up here some forty-odd years , you see what I 'm saying ? And I do n't think Wyoming people give a damn one way or another if you 're gay or straight , that 's just what I just said , does n't matter . If there 's eight men and one woman in a Wyoming bar , which is often the case , now you stop and think  --  who 's getting what ? You see what I 'm saying ? Now jeez , it do n't take a big intelligent mind to figure that one out . p. 21 Act 1 , Scene 9 : Moment : Easier Said Than Done MOMENT : EASIER SAID THAN DONE CATHERINE CONNOLLY My understanding when I first came here NARRATOR Catherine Connolly : CATHERINE CONNOLLY is that I was the first " out " lesbian or gay faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , that was n't that long ago . Um , I was asked at my interview what my husband did , um , and so I came out then . Do you want a funny story ? When you first get here as a new faculty member , there 's all these things you have to do . And so , I was in my office and I noticed that this woman called . I was expecting , you know , it was a health insurance phone call , something like that , and so I called her back . And I could hear her , she 's working on her keyboard , clicking away . I said , you know , " This is Cathy Connolly returning your phone call . " And she said , " Oh . It 's you . " And I thought , " This is bizarre . " And she said , " I hear  --  I hear  --  I hear you 're gay . I hear you are . " I was like , " Uh huh . " And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm one too . Not a couple , just a person . " And so  --  she was  --  a kind of lesbian who knew I was coming and she wanted to come over and meet me immediately . And she later told me that there were other lesbians that she knew who would n't be seen with me . That I would irreparably taint them , that just to be seen with me could be a problem . p. 22 JONAS SLONAKER When I came here I knew it was going to be hard as a gay man . NARRATOR Jonas Slonaker : JONAS SLONAKER But I kept telling myself : People should live where they want to live . And there would be times I would go down to Denver and I would go to gay bars and , um , people would ask where I was from and I 'd say , " Laramie , Wyoming . " And I met so many men down there from Wyoming . So many gay men who grew up here , and they 're like : " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you live there , I had to get out , grrr , grrr , grrr . " But every once in a while there would be a guy , " Oh gosh , I miss Laramie . I mean I really love it there , that 's where I want to live . " And they get this starry-eyed look and I 'm like : If that 's where you want to live , do it . I mean , imagine if more gay people stayed in small towns . But it 's easier said than done of course . p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 10 : Moment : Journal Entries MOMENT : JOURNAL ENTRIES MOIS&amp;EACUTE ; S KAUFMAN Today we are moving from our motel and heading for the Best Western . NARRATOR Moiss Kaufman : MOIS&amp;EACUTE ; S KAUFMAN My hope is that it is a better Western . NARRATOR Amanda Gronich : AMANDA GRONICH Today we divided up to go to different churches in the community . Moiss and I were given a Baptist church . We were welcomed into the services by the reverend himself standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember of his sermon that morning . p. 24 Act 1 , Scene 11 : Moment : The Word MOMENT : THE WORD BAPTIST MINISTER My dear brothers and sisters : I am here today to bring you the Word of the Lord . Now , I have a simple truth that I tell to my colleagues and I 'm gon na tell it to you today : The word is either sufficient or it is not.Scientists tell me that human history , that the world is five billion or six billion years old  --  after all , what 's a billion years give or take ? The Bible tells me that human history is six thousand years old.The word is either sufficient or it is not . STEPHEN MEAD JOHNSON Ah , the sociology of religion in the West NARRATOR Stephen Mead Johnson , Unitarian minister : STEPHEN MEAD JOHNSON Dominant religious traditions in this town : Baptist , Mormon  --  they 're everywhere , it 's not just Salt Lake , you know , they 're all over  --  they 're like jam on toast down here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going that irritates some folks . NARRATOR Doug Laws , Stake Ecclesiastical leader for the Mormon Church : DOUG LAWS And that is that we absolutely believe that God still speaks to man . We do n't think that it happened and some folks wrote it in the Bible . God speaks to us today , and we believe that . We believe that the prophet of the church has the authority to receive inspiration and revelation from God . p. 25 STEPHEN MEAD JOHNSON So , the spectrum would be  --  uh , on the left side of that panel : So far left that I am probably sitting by myself , is me  --  and the Unitarian Church . Unitarians are by and large humanists , many of whom are atheists . I mean  --  we 're , you know , we 're not even sure we 're a religion . And to my right on the spectrum , to his credit , Father Roger , Catholic priest , who is well-established here , and God bless him  --  he did not equivocate at all when this happened  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROGER SCHMIT I was really jolted because , you know , when we did the vigil  --  we wanted to get other ministers involved and we called some of them , and they were not going to get involved . And it was like , " We are gon na stand back and wait and see which way the wind is blowing . " And that angered me immensely . We are supposed to stand out as leaders . I thought , " Wow , what 's going on here ? " DOUG LAWS God has set boundaries . And one of our responsibilities is to learn : What is it that God wants ? So you study Scripture , you look to your leaders . Then you know what the bounds are . Now once you kinda know what the bounds are , then you sorta get a feel for what 's out-of-bounds.There is a proclamation that came out on the family . A family is defined as one woman and one man and children . That 's a family . That 's about as clear as you can state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . No  --  no leniency . We just think it 's out-of-bounds. p. 26 BAPTIST MINISTER I warn you : You will be mocked ! You will be ridiculed for the singularity of your faith ! But you let the Bible be your guide . It 's in there . It 's all in there . STEPHEN MEAD JOHNSON The Christian pastors , many of the conservative ones , were silent on this . Conservative Christians use the Bible to show the rest of the world , It says here in the Bible . And most Americans believe , and they do , that the Bible is the word of God , and how you gon na fight that ? BAPTIST MINISTER I am a Biblicist . Which means : The Bible does n't need me to be true . The Bible is true whether I believe it or not . The word is either sufficient or it is not . STEPHEN MEAD JOHNSON I arrived in Laramie on September fifteenth . I looked around  --  tumbleweed , cement factory  --  and said , " What in the hell am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found out what the hell I 'm doing in Wyoming . p. 27 Act 1 , Scene 12 : A Scarf MOMENT : A SCARF STEPHEN BELBER I had breakfast this morning with a university student named Zubaida Ula . She is an Islamic feminist who likes to do things her own way . ZUBAIDA ULA I 've lived in Laramie since I was four . Yeah . My parents are from Bangladesh . Two years ago , because I 'm Muslim , I decided to start wearing a scarf . That 's really changed my life in Laramie . Yeah.Like people say things to me like , " Why do you have to wear that thing on your head ? " Like when I go to the grocery store , I 'm not looking to give people Islam 101 , you know what I mean ? So I 'll be like , " Well , it 's part of my religion , " and they 'll be  --  this is the worst part cuz they 'll be like , " I know it 's part of your religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supposed to go into the whole doctrine of physical modesty and my own spiritual relationship with the Lord , standing there with my pop and chips ? You know what I mean ? STEPHEN BELBER Yeah . ZUBAIDA ULA You know , it 's so unreal to me that , yeah , that a group from New York would be writing a play about Laramie . And then I was picturing like you 're gon na be in a play about my town . You 're gon na be onstage in New York and you 're gon na be acting like you 're us . That 's so weird . p. 28 Act 1 , Scene 13 : Moment : Lifestyle 1 MOMENT : LIFESTYLE 1 BAPTIST MINISTER 'S WIFE Hello ? AMANDA GRONICH Yes , hello . My name is Amanda Gronich and I am here in Laramie working with a theater company . I went to the reverend 's , your husband 's church on Sunday , and I was extremely interested in talking with the reverend about some of his thoughts about recent events . BAPTIST MINISTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to talk to you . He has very biblical views about homosexuality  --  he does n't condone that kind of violence . But he does n't condone that kind of lifestyle , you know what I mean ? And he was just bombarded with press after this happened and the media has been just terrible about this whole thing . AMANDA GRONICH Oh , I know , I really understand , it must have just been terrible . BAPTIST MINISTER 'S WIFE Oh , yes , I think we are all hoping this just goes away . AMANDA GRONICH Well , um , do you think maybe I could call back and speak with your husband just briefly ? BAPTIST MINISTER 'S WIFE Well , all right , you can call him back tonight at nine . AMANDA GRONICH Oh , thank you so much . I 'll do that . p. 29 Act 1 , Scene 14 : Moment : The Fireside MOMENT : THE FIRESIDE STEPHEN BELBER Today Barbara and I went to the Fireside Bar , which is the last place Matthew was seen in public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , with a couple of pool tables and a stage area for karaoke . Still , the few regulars in the late afternoon were hardly the college crowd . STEPHEN BELBER First person we talked to was Matt Mickelson , the owner . MATT MICKELSON My great-great-grandfather moved here in eighteen sixty-two , he owned Laramie 's first opera house , it was called Old Blue Front , and in eighteen seventy Louisa Grandma Swain cast the first woman 's ballot in any free election in the world , and that 's why Wyoming is the Equality State , so what I want to do is reestablish my bar business as the Old Blue Front Opera House and Good Time Emporium , you know , I want to have a restaurant , I want to have a gift shop , I want to have a pool hall , and do all this shit , you know every night 's ladies ' nightSo the Fireside is the first step towards the Old Blue FrontOpera House and Good Time Emporium . BARBARA PITTS So , what about the night Matthew Shepard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , twenty or thirty people here  --  Matthew Shepard came in , sitting right  --  right where you 're sitting , just hanging out . I mean , if you wan na talk to somebody , you should talk to Matt Galloway , he was the kid that was bartending that night . You 'd have to meet him , his character stands for itself . ( Calling ) Hey , is Galloway bartending tonight ? MATT GALLOWAY Okay . I 'm gon na make this brief , quick , get it over with , but it will be everything  --  factual . Just the facts . Here we go . Ten o'clock . I clock in , usual time , Tuesday nights . Ten-thirty  --  Matthew Shepard shows up  --  alone  --  sits down , orders a Heineken . NARRATOR Phil Labrie , friend of Matthew Shepard : PHIL LABRIE Matt liked to drink Heineken and nothing else . Heineken even though you have to pay nine-fifty for a six-pack . He 'd always buy the same beer . MATT GALLOWAY So what can I tell you about Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be the  --  the most perfect bar I 've ever been in . Okay ? And nothing to do with sexual orientation . Um , absolute mannerisms . Manners . Politeness , intelligence.Taking care of me , as in tips . Everything  --  conversation , uh , dressed nice , clean-cut . Some people you just know , sits down , " Please , " " Thank you "  --  offers intellect , you know , within  --  within  --  within their vocabulary.Um , so , he kicks it there . Did n't seem to have any worries , or like he was looking for anyone . Just enjoy his drink and the company around.Now approximately eleven forty-five , eleven-thirty-eleven forty-five , Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson come in  --  I did n't know their names then , but they 're the accused , they 're the perps , they 're the accused . They walked in , just very stone-faced , you know . Dirty . Grungy . Rude . " Gim me . " That type of thing . They walked up to the bar , uh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dimes and quarters , uh , which is something that I mean you do n't forget . You do n't forget that . Five-fifty in dimes and quarters . That 's a freakin ' nightmare.Now Henderson and McKinney , they did n't seem intoxificated at all . They came in  --  they just ordered a beer , took the pitcher with them back there into the pool room , and kept to themselves . Next thing I knew , probably a half hour later , they were kind of walking around  --  no beer . And I remember thinking to myself that I 'm not gon na ask them if they want another one , because obviously they just paid for a pitcher with dimes and quarters , I have a real good feeling they do n't have any more money . p. 31 NARRATOR Romaine Patterson : ROMAINE PATTERSON Money meant nothing to Matthew , because he came from a lot of it . And he would like hand over his wallet in two seconds  --  because money meant nothing . His  --  shoes  --  might have meant something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy it . For even an iota of a second . MATT GALLOWAY Then a few moments later I looked over and Aaron and Russell had been talking to Matthew Shepard . KRISTIN PRICE Aaron said that a guy walked up to him and said that he was gay , and wanted to get with Aaron and Russ . NARRATOR Kristin Price , girlfriend of Aaron McKinney : KRISTIN PRICE And Aaron got aggravated with it and told him that he was straight and did n't want anything to do with him and walked off . He said that is when he and Russell went to the bathroom and decided to pretend they were gay and get him in the truck and rob him . They wanted to teach him a lesson not to come on to straight people . MATT GALLOWAY Okay , no . They stated that Matt approached them , that he came on to them . I absolutely , positively disbelieve and refute the statement one hundred percent . Refute it . I 'm gon na give you two reasons why.One . Character reference.Why would he approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in the bar . They say he 's gay , he was a flaming gay , he 's gon na come on to people like that . Bullshit . He never came on to me . Hello ? ! ? He came on to them ? I do n't believe it.Two . Territorialism is  --  is  --  is the word I will use for this . And that 's the fact that Matt was sitting there . Russell and Aaron were in the pool area . Upon their first interaction , they were in Matt 's area , in the area that Matt had been seen all night . So who approached who by that ? p. 32 ROMAINE PATTERSON But Matthew was the kind of person like , he would never not talk to someone for any reason . If someone started talking to him , he 'd just be like , " Oh , blah , blah , blah . " He never had any problem just striking up a conversation with anybody . PHIL LABRIE Matt did feel lonely a lot of times . Me knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have walked right into it . The fact that he was at the bar alone without any friends made him that much more vulnerable . MATT GALLOWAY So the only thing is  --  and this is what I 'm testifying to  --  ' cause , you know , I 'm also , basically , the key eyewitness in this case , uh ( pause ) @x ( pause ) I  --  I felt sick to my stomach it 's just instantly sick to my stomach . And I had to tell Romaine , " Yes , it was Matthew . It was your friend . " MATT GALLOWAY Well , I 'll tell you  --  I 'll tell you what is overwhelming . NARRATOR Matt Galloway : MATT GALLOWAY Friday morning I first find out about it . I go to class , walk out , boom there it is  --  in the Branding Iron . So immediately I drive to the nearest newsstand , buy a Laramie Boomerang ' cause I want more details , buy that  --  go home before I can even open the paper , my boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about what happened ? MATT GALLOWAY I 'm like , " Yeah . " MATT MICKELSON Was he in the bar Tuesday night ? MATT GALLOWAY I go , " Yes , yes he was . " MATT MICKELSON You 've got to get down to the bar right now , we 've got to talk about this , we 've got to discuss what 's going to go on . p. 43 JON PEACOCK By this time , I was starting to get upset , but still the severity was n't out yet . RULON STACEY It was Thursday afternoon . NARRATOR Rulon Stacey at Poudre Valley Hospital : RULON STACEY I got a call : " We just got a kid in from Wyoming and it looks like he may be the victim of a hate crime . We have a couple of newspaper reporters here asking questions . " And so , we agreed that we needed one spokesperson : As CEO , I 'll do that and we 'll try and gather all the information that we can . ROMAINE PATTERSON And then I watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the nature and the seriousness of it MATT GALLOWAY So I 'm on the phone with Mickelson and he 's like : MATT MICKELSON We need to go to the arraignment so we can identify these guys , and make sure these guys were in the bar . MATT GALLOWAY So we go to the arraignment . p. 44 Act 2 , Scene 2 : Moment : The Essential Facts MOMENT : THE ESSENTIAL FACTS NEWSPERSON Our focus today turns to Laramie , Wyoming , and the Albany County Courthouse , where Aaron James McKinney and Russell Arthur Henderson are being charged with the brutal beating of Matthew Shepard , a gay University of Wyoming student . NARRATOR Catherine Connolly : CATHERINE CONNOLLY The arraignment was on Friday . Right around lunchtime . And I said , " I 'm just going . " I just took off  --  it 's just down the street . So I walked a few blocks and I went . Has anybody told you about the arraignment ? There were probably about a hundred people from town and probably as many news media . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come out . The fact that the perpetrators were kids themselves , local kids , that everyone who 's from around here has some relationship to . And what  --  Everyone was really I think waiting on pins and needles for what would happen when the perpetrators walked in . And what happened  --  there 's two hundred people in the room at this point they walked in in their complete orange jumpsuits and their shackles , and , you could have heard a pin drop.It was incredibly solemn.I mean , lots of people were teary at that point . Then the judge came in and did a reading  --  there was a reading of the evidence that the prosecution has and  --  it 's just a  --  it 's a statement of facts , and the reading of the facts was p. 45 JUDGE The essential facts are that the defendants , Aaron James McKinney and Russell Arthur Henderson , met Matthew Shepard at the Fireside Bar , and after Mr. Shepard confided he was gay , the subjects deceived Mr. Shepard into leaving with them in their vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both subjects tied their victim to a buck fence , robbed him , tortured him , and beat him . Both defendants were later contacted by officers of the Laramie Police Department , who observed inside the cab of their pickup a credit card and a pair of black patent leather shoes belonging to the victim , Matthew Shepard . ( The JUDGE goes sotto voce here while CATHERINE CONNOLLY speaks . ) The subjects took the victim 's credit card , wallet containing twenty dollars in cash , his shoes , and other items , and obtained the victim 's address in order to later burglarize his home . CATHERINE CONNOLLY I do n't think there was any person who was left in that courtroom who was n't crying at the end of it . I mean it lasted  --  five minutes , but it kept on getting more and more horrific , ending with : JUDGE Said defendants left the victim begging for his life . p. 46 Act 2 , Scene 3 : Moment : Live and Let Live MOMENT : LIVE AND LET LIVE NARRATOR Sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I think a lot of people just do n't understand , and even I do n't really understand , how someone can do something like that . We have one of the most vocal populations of gay people in the state . And it 's pretty much : Live and let live . NARRATOR Laramie resident Jeffrey Lockwood : JEFFREY LOCKWOOD My secret hope was that they were from somewhere else , that then of course you can create that distance : We do n't grow children like that here . Well , it 's pretty clear that we do grow children like that here CATHERINE CONNOLLY So that was the arraignment , and my response  --  was pretty catatonic  --  not sleeping , not eating . Do n't  --  you know , do n't leave me alone right now . JON PEACOCK More and more details came in about the sheer brutality , um , motivations , how this happened . And then quite frankly the media descended and there was no time to reflect on it anymore . p. 47 Act 2 , Scene 4 : Moment : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CITY OF THE PLAINS ( Many reporters enter the stage , followed by media crews carrying cameras , microphones , and lights . They start speaking into the cameras . Simultaneously , television monitors enter the space  --  in our production they flew in from above the light grid . In the monitors , one can see in live feed the reporters speaking as well as other media images . The texts overlap to create a kind of media cacophony . This moment should feel like an invasion and should be so perceived by the other actors onstage . ) NEWSPERSON Laramie , Wyoming  --  often called the Gem City of the Plains  --  is now at the eye of the storm . ( Enter NEWSPERSON 2 . NEWSPERSON I goes sotto voce . ) The cowboy state has its rednecks and yahoos for sure , but there are no more bigots per capita in Wyoming than there are in New York , Florida , or California . The difference is that in Wyoming there are fewer places to blend in if you 're anything other than prairie stock . NEWSPERSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor side of town . ( Enter NEWSPERSON 3 . NEWSPERSON 2 goes sotto voce . ) Both were from broken homes and as teenagers had had runins with the law . They lived in trailer parks and scratched out a living working at fast-food restaurants and fixing roofs . p. 48 NEWSPERSON 3 As a gay college student lay hospitalized in critical condition after a severe beating this small city , which bills itself as Wyoming 's Hometown , wrestled with its attitudes toward gay men . ( Enter NEWSPERSON 4 . NEWSPERSON 3 goes sotto voce . ) NEWSPERSON 4 People would like to think that what happened to Matthew was an exception to the rule , but it was an extreme version of what happens in our schools on a daily basis . ( The voices and sounds have escalated to a high-pitch . And the last text we hear is : ) NEWSPERSON It 's a tough business , as Matt Shepard knew , and as his friends all know , to be gay in cowboy country . ( These reporters continue speaking into the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was huge . Yeah . It was herds and  --  and we 're talking hundreds of reporters , which makes a huge dent in this town 's population . There 's reporters everywhere , news trucks everywhere on campus , everywhere in the town . And we 're not used to that type of attention to begin with , we 're not used to that type of exposure . NARRATOR Tiffany Edwards , local reporter : TIFFANY EDWARDS These people are predators . Like this one journalist actually caught one of the judges in the bathroom at the urinal and was like asking him questions . And the judge was like , " Excuse me , can I please have some privacy ? " And the journalist was like OFFENDED that he asked for privacy . I mean , this is not how journalism started , like the Gutenberg press , you know . p. 49 DOC O'CONNOR I 'll tell you what , when Hard Copy came and taped me , I taped them at the exact same time . I have every word I ever said on tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fuckin ' ass . NEWSPERSON Wyoming governor Jim Geringer , a first-term Republican up for reelection : GOVERNOR JIM GERINGER I am outraged and sickened by the heinous crime committed on Matthew Shepard . I extend my most heartfelt sympathies to the family . NEWSPERSON Governor , you have n't pushed hate crime legislation in the past . GOVERNOR JIM GERINGER I would like to urge the people of Wyoming against overreacting in a way that gives one group " special rights over others . " We will wait and see if the vicious beating and torture of Matthew Shepard was motivated by hate . SERGEANT HING You 've got the beginning of the news story where they have the graphics in the background , and they 've got : " Murder in Wyoming , " and Wyoming 's dripping red like it 's got blood on it or something , and it 's like , what 's the  --  what is this , this is sensationalism . And we 're here going , " Wait a minute . We had the guys in jail in less than a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EILEEN ENGEN And for us to be more or less maligned. p. 50 NARRATOR Eileen and Gil Engen : EILEEN ENGEN That we 're not a good community and we are  --  The majority of people here are good people . GIL ENGEN You git bad apples once in a while . And I think that the gay community took this as an advantage , said this is a good time for us to exploit this . NEWSPERSON Bill McKinney , father of one of the accused : BILL MCKINNEY Had this been a heterosexual these two boys decided to take out and rob , this never would have made the national news . Now my son is guilty before he 's even had a trial . TIFFANY EDWARDS Look , I do think that , um , the media actually made people accountable . Because they made people think . Because people were sitting in their homes , like watching TV and listening to CNN and watching Dan Rather and going , " Jesus Christ , well that 's not how it is here . " Well how is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moment : Medical Update MOMENT : MEDICAL UPDATE NARRATOR Matthew Shepard update at three P.M. , Saturday , October tenth . RULON STACEY By this point , I looked out there and where there had been two or three reporters it must have been ten or fifteen still photographers , another twenty or thirty reporters , and ten video cameras . The parents had just arrived . I had barely introduced myself to them . I looked out there and I thought , " My gosh . What am I going to do ? " ( He crosses to the area where the reporters are gathered with their cameras . As he arrives , several camera flashes go off . He speaks straight into the camera . We see his image on the monitors around the stage . ) Matthew Shepard was admitted in critical condition approximately nine-fifteen P.M. , October seventh . When he arrived , he was unresponsive , and breathing support was being provided.Matthew 's major injuries upon arrival consisted of hypothermia and a fracture from behind his head to just in front of the right ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pressure on the brain . There were also several lacerations on his head , face , and neck.Matthew 's temperature has fluctuated over the last twenty-four hours , ranging from ninety-eight to one hundred and six degrees . We have had difficulty controlling his temperature.Matthew 's parents arrived at seven P.M. , October ninth , and are now at his bedside . The following is a statement from them:First of all , we want to thank the American public for their kind thoughts about Matthew and their fond wishes for his speedy recovery . We appreciate your prayers and goodwill , and we know that they are something Matthew would appreciate , too.We also have a special request for the members of the media . Matthew is very much in need of his family at this time . and we ask that you respect our privacy , as well as Matthew 's , so we can concentrate all of our efforts , thoughts , and love on our son.Thank you very much . p. 52 p. 53 Act 2 , Scene 6 : Moment : Seeing Matthew MOMENT : SEEING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty to charges . Their girlfriends , Chasity Pasley and Kristin Price , also pled not guilty after being charged as accessories after the fact . On our next trip , we spoke to the chief investigating officer on the case , Detective Rob DeBree of the Albany County Sheriff 's Department . ROB DEBREE I guess the thing that bothered me the most was when I went down to Poudre Valley , where Matthew was , and the thing that botherted me the most is seeing him , touching him . As a homicide detective , you look at bodies . This poor boy is sitting here , fighting all his life , trying to make it . I wanted it so by the book you know . AARON KREIFELS I keep seeing that picture in my head when I found him NARRATOR Aaron Kreifels : AARON KREIFELS and it 's not pleasant whatsoever . I do n't want it to be there . I wan na like get it out . That 's the biggest part for me is seeing that picture in my head . And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I happened to be the person who found him  --  because the big question with me , like with my religion , is like , Why did God want ME to find him ? p. 54 CATHERINE CONNOLLY I know how to take care of myself , and I was irrationally terrified . NARRATOR Catherine Connolly : CATHERINE CONNOLLY So what that means is , not letting my twelve-year-old son walk the streets , seeing a truck do a U-turn and thinking it 's coming after me . Having to stop because I 'm shaking so bad . And , in fact , the pickup truck did not come after me , but my reaction was to have my heart in my mouth . MATT GALLOWAY Ultimately , no matter how you dice it , I did have an opportunity . NARRATOR Matt Galloway : MATT GALLOWAY If I had  --  amazing hindsight of 20/20  --  to have stopped  --  what occurred and I keep thinkin ' , " I shoulda noticed . These guys shouldn'ta been talking to this guy . I shoulda not had my head down when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I coulda done . What the hell was I thinking ? " ROB DEBREE So you do a lot of studying , you spend hours and hours and hours . You study and study and study talking to the officers , making sure they understand , talk to your witnesses again , and then always coming back to I get this flash of seeing Matthew . I wanted it so tight that there was no way that they were gon na get out of this . p. 55 REGGIE FLUTY One of the things that happened when I got to the fence NARRATOR Reggie Fluty : REGGIE FLUTY It was just such an overwhelming amount of blood and we try to wear protective gloves , but we had a really cheap sheriff at the time , and he bought us shit gloves , you know , you put ' em on , you put ' em on , and they kept breaking , so finally you just ran out of gloves , you know . So , you figure , well , you know , " Do n't hesitate , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time  --  Do n't hesitate  --  and so you just keep moving and you try to help Matthew and find an airway and , you know , that 's what you do , you know . MARGE MURRAY The thing I was n't telling you before is that Reggie is my daughter . NARRATOR Marge Murray : MARGE MURRAY And when she first told me she wanted to be a police officer , well , I thought there was not a better choice for her . She could handle whatever came her way . REGGIE FLUTY Probably a day and a half later , the hospital called me and told me Matthew had HIV . And the doctor said , " You 've been exposed , and you 've had a bad exposure , " because , you see , I 'd been  --  been building  --  building a , uh , lean-to for my llamas , and my hands had a bunch of open cuts on ' em , so I was kinda screwed ( she laughs ) you know , and you think , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you like to talk about losing sleep ? REGGIE FLUTY So I said to the doctor , " Okay , what do I do ? " And they said , " Get up here . " So , I got up there and we started the ATZ ( sic ) drugs . Immediately . MARGE MURRAY Now they told me that 's a medication that if it 's administered thirty-six hours after you 've been exposed it can maybe stop your getting the disease REGGIE FLUTY That is a mean nasty medicine . Mean . I 've lost ten pounds and a lot of my hair . Yeah MARGE MURRAY And quite frankly I wanted to lash out at somebody . Not at Matthew , please understand that , not one of us was mad at Matthew . But we maybe wanted to squeeze McKinney 's head off . And I think about Henderson . And , you know , two absolutely human beings cause so much grief for so many people . It has been terrible for my whole family , but mostly for her and her kids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what their mom does for a living . MARGE MURRAY Well , Reggie , you know what I 'm gon na tell you now . REGGIE FLUTY And my parents told me , you know , they both said the same damn thing . MARGE MURRAY You 're quitting this damn job ! p. 57 REGGIE FLUTY And it 's just a parent thing , you know , and they 're terribly proud of you , ' cause you do a good job whether it 's handling a drunk or handling a case like this , but you 're , you know , they do n't want you getting hurt  --  MARGE MURRAY Like I said , there 's a right way , a wrong way , and then there 's Reggie 's way . REGGIE FLUTY So finally I said , " Oh , for God 's sakes , lighten up , Francis ! " MARGE MURRAY You are so stubborn ! REGGIE FLUTY They say I 'm stubborn , and I do n't believe them , but I just think , you know , okay , I 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-nine years old , you know , what are they gon na do , spank me ? MARGE MURRAY Reggie , do n't give me any ideas . REGGIE FLUTY It 'd look pretty funny . You know , what can they say ? MARGE MURRAY I just hope she does n't go before me . I just could n't handle that . p. 58 Act 2 , Scene 7 : Moment : E-Mail MOMENT : E-MAIL NARRATOR University of Wyoming president Philip Dubois : PHILIP DUBOIS Well , this is a young person  --  who read my statement on the Denver Post story , and sent me an e-mail , to me directly , and said : E-mail Writer : You and the straight people of Laramie and Wyoming are guilty of the beating of Matthew Shepard just as the Germans who looked the other way are guilty of the deaths of the Jews , the Gypsies , and the homosexuals . You have taught your straight children to hate their gay and lesbian brothers and sisters . Unless and until you acknowledge that Matt Shepard 's beating is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of random crazies , you have Matthew 's blood on your hands . PHILIP DUBOIS And uh , well , I just ca n't begin to tell you what that does to you . And it 's like , you ca n't possibly know what I 'm thinking , you ca n't possibly know what this has done to me and my family and my community . p. 59 Act 2 , Scene 8 : Moment : Vigils MOMENT : VIGILS ( We see images of the vigils taking place around the country in the monitors as : ) NARRATOR That first week alone , vigils were held in Laramie , Denver , Fort Collins , and Colorado Springs . Soon after in Detroit , Chicago , San Francisco , Washington , D.C. , Atlanta , Nashville , Minneapolis , and Portland , Maine , among others . In Los Angeles , five thousand people gathered , and in New York City a political rally ended in civil disobedience and hundreds of arrests . And the Poudre Valley Hospital Web site received close to a million visitors from across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Matthew 's recovery . p. 60 Act 2 , Scene 9 : Moment : Medical Update MOMENT : MEDICAL UPDATE NARRATOR Matthew Shepard medical update at nine A.M. , Sunday , October eleventh . ( RULON STACEY is in front of the cameras . We see him on the monitors . ) RULON STACEY As of nine A.M. today , Matthew Shepard remains in critical condition . The family continues to emphasize that the media respect their privacy . The family also wants to thank the American public for their kind thoughts and concern for Matthew . p. 61 Act 2 , Scene 10 : Moment : Live and Let Live MOMENT : LIVE AND LET LIVE JEDADIAH SCHULTZ There are certain things when I sit in church . NARRATOR Jedadiah Schultz : JEDADIAH SCHULTZ And the reverend will tell you flat out he does n't agree with homosexuality  --  and I do n't know  --  I think right now , I 'm going through changes , I 'm still learning about myself and  --  you know I do n't feel like I know enough about certain things to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you 've been raised your whole life that it 's wrong  --  and right now , I would say that I do n't agree with it  --  yeah , that I do n't agree with it but  --  maybe that 's just because I could n't do it  --  and speaking in religious terms  --  I do n't think that 's how God intended it to happen . But I do n't hate homosexuals and , I mean  --  I 'm not going to persecute them or anything like that . At all  --  I mean , that 's not gon na be getting in the way between me and the other person at all . CONRAD MILLER Well , it 's preached in schools that being gay is okay . NARRATOR Conrad Miller : CONRAD MILLER And if my kids asked me , I 'd set them down and I 'd say , " Well , this is what gay people do . This is what animals do . Okay ? " And I 'd tell ' em , " This is the life , this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say , " This is why I believe it 's wrong . " p. 62 MURDOCK COOPER There 's more gay people around than what you think . NARRATOR Murdock Cooper : MURDOCK COOPER It does n't bother anybody because most of ' em that are gay or lesbian they know damn well who to talk to . If you step out of line you 're asking for it . Some people are saying he made a pass at them . You do n't pick up regular people . I 'm not excusing their actions , but it made me feel better because it was partially Matthew Shepard 's fault and partially the guys who did it you know , maybe it 's fifty-fifty . ZACKIE SALMON Yes , as a lesbian I was more concerned for my safety . NARRATOR Zackie Salmon : ZACKIE SALMON I think we all were . And I think it 's because somewhere inside we know it could happen to us anytime , you know . I mean , I would be afraid to walk down the street and display any sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that here in Laramie . JONAS SLONAKER Well , there 's this whole idea : You leave me alone , I leave you alone . NARRATOR Jonas Slonaker : JONAS SLONAKER And it 's even in some of the western literature , you know , live and let live . That is such crap . I tell my friends that  --  even my gay friends bring it up sometimes . I 'm like , " That is crap , you know ? " I mean , basically what it boils down to : If I do n't tell you I 'm a fag , you wo n't beat the crap out of me . I mean , what 's so great about that ? That 's a great philosophy ? p. 63 p. 64 Act 2 , Scene 11 : Moment : It Happened Here MOMENT : IT HAPPENED HERE ZUBAIDA ULA We went to the candle vigil . NARRATOR Zubaida Ula : ZUBAIDA ULA And it was so good to be with people who felt like shit . I kept feeling like I do n't deserve to feel this bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " C'm on , guys , let 's show the world that Laramie is not this kind of a town . " But it is that kind of a town . If it was n't this kind of a town , why did this happen here ? I mean , you know what I mean , like  --  that 's a lie . Because it happened here . So how could it not be a town where this kind of thing happens ? Like , that 's just totally  --  like , looking at an Escher painting and getting all confused , like , it 's just totally like circular logic like how can you even say that ? And we have to mourn this and we have to be sad that we live in a town , a state , a country where shit like this happens . And I 'm not going to step away from that and say , " We need to show the world this did n't happen . " I mean , these are people trying to distance themselves from this crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone needs to own it . We are like this . We ARE like this . WE are LIKE this . p. 65 Act 2 , Scene 12 : Moment : Shannon and Jen MOMENT : SHANNON AND JEN STEPHEN BELBER I was in the Fireside one afternoon and I ran into two friends of Aaron McKinney , Shannon and Jen . ( To Shannon and Jen ) You knew Aaron well , right ? SHANNON Yeah , we both did . When I first found out about this , I thought it was really really awful . I do n't know whether Aaron was fucked up or whether he was coming down or what , but Matthew had money . Shit , he had better clothes than I did . Matthew was a little rich bitch . JEN You should n't call him a rich bitch though , that 's not right . SHANNON Well , I 'm not saying he 's a bad guy either , because he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time , said the wrong things . And I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was times that I was all messed up on meth and I thought about going out and robbing . I mean , I never did . But yeah , it was there . It 's easy money . JEN Aaron 's done that thing before . They 've both done it . I know one night they went to Cheyenne to go do it and they came back with probably three hundred dollars . I do n't know if they ever chose like gay people as their particular targets before , but anyone that looked like they had a lot of money and that was you know , they could outnumber , or overpower , was fair game . p. 66 STEPHEN BELBER But do you think there was any homophobia involved in this that contributed to some of it ? JEN Probably . It probably would 've pissed him off that Matthew was gay ' cause he did n't like  --  the gay people that I 've seen him interact with , he was fine as long as , you know , they did n't hit on him . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as long as they were n't doing it in front of him . STEPHEN BELBER Do you get the impression that Aaron knew other gay people ? SHANNON I 'm sure that he knew people that are gay . I mean , he worked up at KFC and there was a couple people up there that  --  yeah ( he laughs )  --  and I 'm not saying it 's bad or anything ' cause I do n't know , half the people I know in Laramie are gay . STEPHEN BELBER What would you guys say to Aaron if you saw him right now ? SHANNON First of all , I 'd ask him if he 'd ever do anymore tweak . JEN He would n't I bet . If I saw Aaron now I 'd be like , " Man , why 'd you fuck up like that ? " But , I 'd want to make sure he 's doing good in there . But , I 'm sure he is though . I 'd probably just want to like hang out with him . p. 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants one so bad . STEPHEN BELBER So , you guys both went to Laramie High ? SHANNON Yeah , Ca n't you tell ? We 're a product of our society . p. 68 Act 2 , Scene 13 : Moment : Homecoming MOMENT : HOMECOMING NEWSPERSON On a day that is traditionally given over to nothing more profound than collegiate exuberance and the fortunes of the University of Wyoming football team , this community on the high plains had a different kind of homecoming Saturday , as many searched their souls in the wake of a vicious , apparent antigay hate crime . NARRATOR University president Philip Dubois : PHILIP DUBOIS This was homecoming weekend . There were a lot of people in town , and there 's a homecoming parade that was scheduled , and then the students organized to tag onto the back of it  --  you know , behind the banner supporting Matt , and everybody wearing the armbands that the students had created HARRY WOODS I live in the center of town . NARRATOR Harry Woods : HARRY WOODS And my apartment has windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes south . And that is exactly the homecoming parade route . Now , on the day of the parade , I had a cast on my leg because of a fall . So I was very disappointed because I really wanted to walk with the people that were marching for Matthew . But I could n't . So I watched from my window . And it was it was just I 'm fifty-two years old and I 'm gay . I have lived here for many years and I 've seen a lot . And I was very moved when I saw the tag on the end of the homecoming parade . About a hundred people walking behind a banner for Matthew Shepard.So then the parade went down to the end of the block to make a U-turn , and I went to the other side of my apartment to wait for it to come south down the other street . p. 69 MATT GALLOWAY I was right up in front there where they were holding the banner for Matthew , and let me tell you I 've never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible . A mass of people . Families  --  mothers holding their six-year-old kids , tying these armbands around these six-year-old kids and trying to explain to them why they should wear an armband . Just amazing . I mean it was absolutely one of the most  --  beautiful things I 've ever done in my life . HARRY WOODS Well , about ten minutes went by , and sure enough the parade started coming down the street . And then I noticed the most incredible thing as the parade came down the street the number of people walking for Matthew Shepard had grown five times . There were at least five hundred people marching for Matthew . Five hundred people . Can you imagine ? The tag at the end was larger than the entire parade . And people kept joining in . And you know what ? I started to cry . Tears were streaming down my face . And I thought , " Thank God that I got to see this in my lifetime . " And my second thought was , " Thank you , Matthew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : One of Ours MOMENT : ONE OF OURS SHERRY JOHNSON I really have n't been all that involved , per se . My husband 's a highway patrolman , so that 's really the only way that I 've known about it.Now when I first found out I just thought it was horrible . I just , I ca n't Nobody deserves that ! I do n't care who ya are.But , the other thing that was not brought out  --  at the same time this happened that patrolman was killed . And there was nothing . Nothing . They did n't say anything about the old man that killed him . He was driving down the road and he should n't have been driving and killed him . It was just a little piece in the paper . And we lost one of our guys.You know , my husband worked with him . This man was brand-new on the force . But , I mean , here 's one of ours , and it was just a little piece in the paper.And a lot of it is my feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And making him as a martyr . And I do n't think he was . I do n't think he was that pure.Now , I did n't know him , but there 's just so many things about him that I found out that I just , it 's scary . You know about his character and spreading AIDS and a few other things , you know , being the kind of person that he was . He was , he was just a barfly , you know . And I think he pushed himself around . I think he flaunted it.Everybody 's got problems . But why they exemplified him I do n't know . What 's the difference if you 're gay ? A hate crime is a hate crime . If you murder somebody you hate ' em . It has nothing to do with if you 're gay or a prostitute or whatever . I do n't understand . I do n't understand . p. 71 p. 72 Act 2 , Scene 15 : Two Queers and a Catholic Priest MOMENT : TWO QUEERS AND A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is one of the last days on our second trip to Laramie . Greg and I have been conducting interviews nonstop and we are exhausted . GREG PIEROTTI We are to meet Father Roger at seven-thirty in the morning . I was wishing we could skip it all together , but we have to follow through to the end . So here we go : seven-thirty A.M. , two queers and a Catholic priest . FATHER ROGER SCHMIT Matthew Shepard has served us well . You realize that ? He has served us well . And I do not mean to condemn Matthew to perfection , but I can not mention anyone who has done more for this community than Matthew Shepard.And I 'm not gon na sit here and say , " I was just this bold guy  --  no fear . " I was scared . I was very vocal in this community when this happened  --  and I thought , " You know , should we , uh , should we call the bishop and ask him permission to do the vigil ? " And I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do that . " His permission does n't make it correct , you realize that ? And I 'm not knocking bishops , but what is correct is correct.You people are just out here on a search , though . I will do this . I will trust you people that if you write a play of this , that you ( pause ) say it right , say it correct . I think you have a responsibility to do that.Do n't  --  do n't  --  do n't , um ( pause ) do n't make matters worse . You think violence is what they did to Matthew  --  they did do violence to Matthew  --  but you know , every time that you are called a fag , or you are called a you know , a lez or whatever p. 73 LEIGH FONDAKOWSKI Or a dyke . FATHER ROGER SCHMIT Dyke , yeah , dyke . Do you realize that is violence ? That is the seed of violence . And I would resent it immensely if you use anything I said , uh , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in its smallest form . I would resent it immensely . You need to know that . LEIGH FONDAKOWSKI Thank you , Father , for saying that . FATHER ROGER SCHMIT Just deal with what is true . You know what is true . You need to do your best to say it correct . p. 74 Act 2 , Scene 16 : Moment : Christmas MOMENT : CHRISTMAS NARRATOR Andrew Gomez : ANDREW GOMEZ I was in there , I was in jail with Aaron in December . I got thrown in over Christmas . Assault and battery , two counts . I do n't wan na talk about it . But we were sittin ' there eatin ' our Christmas dinner , tryin ' to eat my stuffing , my motherfucking bread , my little roll and whatnot , and I asked him , I was like , " Hey , homey , tell me something , tell me something please , why did you  --  " Okay , I 'm thinking how I worded this , I was like , " Why did you kill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faggot later ? " You know ? I mean , think about it , he 's either gon na get humped a lot on he 's gon na die . So why would you do that , think about that . I do n't understand that.And you know what he told me ? Honest to God , this is what he said , he goes : " He tried to grab my dick . " That 's what he said , man ! He 's dumb , dog , he do n't even act like it was nothin.Now I heard they was auctioning those boys off . Up there in the max ward , you know , where the killers go , I heard that when they found out Aaron was coming to prison , they were auctioning those boys off . " I want him . I 'll put aside five , six , seven cartons of cigarettes . " Auction his ass off . I 'd be scared to go to prison if I was those two boys . p. 75 Act 2 , Scene 17 : Moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AMANDA GRONICH Reverend ? BAPTIST MINISTER Yes , hello . AMANDA GRONICH I believe your wife told you a bit about why I 'm contacting you . BAPTIST MINISTER Yes , she did . And let me tell you  --  uh  --  I do n't know that I really want to talk to anyone about any of this incident  --  uh  --  I am somewhat involved and I just do n't think AMANDA GRONICH Yes , I completely understand and I do n't blame you . You know , I went to your service on Sunday . BAPTIST MINISTER You went to the services on Sunday ? AMANDA GRONICH Yes , I did . BAPTIST MINISTER On Sunday ? AMANDA GRONICH Yes , this past Sunday . BAPTIST MINISTER Did I meet you ? AMANDA GRONICH Yes , you welcomed me at the beginning , I believe . BAPTIST MINISTER I see . Well , let me tell you . I am not afraid to be controversial or to speak my mind , and that is not necessarily the views of my congregation per se . Now as I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case  --  well , the girlfriend of the accused is a member of our congregation , and one of the accused has visited . p. 76 AMANDA GRONICH Mmmmmm . BAPTIST MINISTER Now , those two people , the accused , have forfeited their lives . We 've been after the two I mentioned for ages , trying to get them to live right , to do right . Now , one boy is on suicide watch and I am working with him  --  until they put him in the chair and turn on the juice I will work for his salvation . Now I think they deserve the death penalty  --  I will try to deal with them spiritually . AMANDA GRONICH Right , I understand . BAPTIST MINISTER Now , as for the victim , I know that that lifestyle is legal , but I will tell you one thing : I hope that Matthew Shepard as he was tied to that fence , that he had time to reflect on a moment when someone had spoken the word of the Lord to him  --  and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reflect on his lifestyle . AMANDA GRONICH Thank you , Reverend , I appreciate your speaking with me . ( Rain begins to fall on the stage. ) p. 77 Act 2 , Scene 18 : Moment : That Night MOMENT : THAT NIGHT RULON STACEY About eleven-thirty that night , I had just barely gone to bed , and Margo , our chief operating officer , called and said , " His blood pressure has started to drop . " " Well , let 's wait and see . " She called me about ten after  --  he just died . So I quick got dressed and came in , and uh went into the ICU where the family was , and Judy came up and she put her arms around me and I put my arms around her and we just stood there  --  honestly , for about ten minutes just  --  ' cause what else do you do ? And then we had to sit and talk about things that you just  --  " Dennis , it 's now public knowledge . And I 'm gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has happened . " ' Cause by this point it was clear to us that it was the world  --  it was the whole world.And so Judy told me what she wanted me to say . And I went out at four A.M. ( He crosses to the camera. ) p. 78 Act 2 , Scene 19 : Moment : Medical Update MOMENT : MEDICAL UPDATE NARRATOR Matthew Shepard medical update for four-thirty A.M. , Monday , October twelfth . RULON STACEY At twelve midnight on Monday , October twelfth , Matthew Shepard 's blood pressure began to drop . We immediately notified his family , who were already at the hospital.At twelve fifty-three A.M. Matthew Shepard died . His family was at his bedside.The family did release the following statement , The family again asked me to express their sincerest gratitude to the entire world for the overwhelming response for their son.The family was grateful that they did not have to make a decision regarding whether or not to continue life support for their son . Like a good son , he was caring to the end and removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature and left the world premature . Matthew 's mother said : Go home , give your kids a hug , and do n't let a day go by without telling them that you love them . p. 79 Act 2 , Scene 20 : Moment : Magnitude MOMENT : MAGNITUDE RULON STACEY And  --  I do n't know how I let that happen  --  I lost it on national television , but , you now , we had been up for like seventy-two hours straight and gone home and gone to sleep for half an hour and had to get up and come in  --  and maybe I was just way  --  I do n't know  --  but ( pause ) in a moment of complete brain-deadness , while I was out there reading that statement I thought about my own four daughters  --  and go home , hug your kids ( he begins to cry ) and , oh , she does n't have her kid anymore.And there I am and I 'm thinking , " This is so lame . " Um , and then we started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were just generally very kind . But I did get this one . This guy wrote me and said , " Do you cry like a baby on TV for all of your patients or just the faggots ? " And as I told you before , homosexuality is not a lifestyle with which I agree . Um , but having been thrown into this ( pause ) I guess I did n't understand the magnitude with which some people hate . And of all the letters that we got , there were maybe two or three that were like that , most of them were , Thank you for your caring and compassion , and Matthew had caring and compassion from the moment he got here . p. 80 Act 2 , Scene 21 : Moment : H-O-P-E MOMENT : H-O-P-E STEPHEN BELBER I spoke with Doc today and told him we would soon be coming back out for the upcoming trials of Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney , and this is what he had to say . DOC O'CONNOR I 'll tell you what , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything Matt would be thinking about on them . Because Matt would not want those two to die . He 'd want to leave them with hope . ( Spelling ) @x ( The stage is now empty except for several chairs stage right . They occupy that half of the stage . They are all facing the audience and arranged in rows as if to suggest a church or a courthouse . As the lights come up , several actors are sitting there dressed in black . Some of them have umbrellas . A few beats with just this image in silence . Then MATT GALLOWAY enters stage left . Looks at them and says : ) MOMENT : SNOW MATT GALLOWAY The day of the funeral , it was snowing so bad , big huge wet snowflakes .

The service invites your full participation . PRIEST The Lord be with you . PEOPLE And also with you . p. 82 PRIEST Let us pray . TIFFANY EDWARDS And I guess it was like the worst storm that they have had . NARRATOR Tiffany Edwards : TIFFANY EDWARDS Like that anybody could ever tell , like trees fell down and the power went out for a couple of days because of it and I just thought , " It 's like the forces of the universe at work , you know . PRIEST For our brother , Matthew , let us pray to our Lord Jesus Christ , who said , " I am the Resurrection and the Life . " We pray to the Lord . PEOPLE HEAR US , LORD .

We pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the funeral NARRATOR Kerry Drake , Casper Star-Tribune : KERRY DRAKE is seeing the Reverend Fred Phelps from Kansas that scene go up in the park . FRED PHELPS Do you believe the Bible ? Do you believe you 're supposed to separate the precious from the vile ? You do n't believe that part of the Bible ? You stand over there ignorant of the fact that the Bible  --  two times for every verse it talks about God 's love it talks about God 's hate . ( REVEREND FRED PHELPS continues sotto voce . ) KERRY DRAKE A bunch of high school kids who got out early came over and started yelling at some of these people in the protest  --  the Fred Phelps people  --  and across the street you had people lining up for the funeral . Well , I remember a guy , this skinhead coming over , and he was dressed in leather and spikes everywhere , and he came over from across the street where the protest was and he came into the crowd and I just thought , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUT instead he came over and he started leading them in " Amazing Grace . " ( The people sing " Amazing Grace . " ) p. 84 FRED PHELPS We would n't be here if this was just another murder the state was gon na deal with . The state deals with hundreds of murders every single day . But this murder is different , because the fags are bringing us out here trying to make Matthew Shepard into a poster boy for the gay lifestyle . And we 're going to answer it . It 's just that simple . ( REVEREND FRED PHELPS continues sotto voce . ) NARRATOR Six months later , the company returned to Laramie for the trial of Russell Henderson , the first of the two perpetrators . It was to be a capital murder trial . When we got to the Albany County Courthouse , Fred Phelps was already there . FRED PHELPS You do n't like that attribute of God . NARRATOR But so was Romaine Patterson . FRED PHELPS That perfect attribute of God . Well , WE love that attribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because God 's hatred is pure . It 's a determination  --  it 's a determination that he 's gon na send some people to hell . That 's God 's hatred ( Continues sotto voce . ) We 're standing here with God 's message . We 're standing here with God 's message . Is homosexuality  --  is being a fag okay ? What do you mean it 's not for you to judge ? If God does n't hate fags , why does he put ' em in hell ? You see the barrenness and sterility of your silly arguments when set over against some solid gospel truth ? Barren and sterile . Like your lifestyle . Your silly arguments . p. 85 ROMAINE PATTERSON After seeing Fred Phelps protesting at Matthew 's funeral and finding out that he was coming to Laramie for the trial of Russell Henderson , I decided that someone needed to stand toe-to-toe with this guy and show the differences . And I think at times like this , when we 're talking about hatred as much as the nation is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better way of dealing with that kind of hatred.So our idea is to dress up like angels . And so we have designed an angel outfit  --  for our wings are huge  --  they 're like big-ass wings  --  and there 'll be ten to twenty of us that are angels  --  and what we 're gon na do is we 're gon na encircle Phelps and because of our big wings  --  we are gon na com-plete-ly block him.So this big-ass band of angels comes in , we do n't say a fuckin ' word , we just turn our backs to him and we stand there . And we are a group of people bringing forth a message of peace and love and compassion . And we 're calling it " Angel Action . " Yeah , this twenty-one-year-old little lesbian is ready to walk the line with him . FRED PHELPS When those old preachers laid their hands on me it 's called an ordination . Mine was from Isaiah fifty-eight : one  --  " Cry aloud . Spare not . Lift up thy voice like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PATTERSON And I knew that my angels were gon na be taking the brunt of everything he had to yell and say . I mean , we were gon na be blocking his view and he was gon na be liked pissed off to all hell . So I went out and bought all my angels earplugs .

( All stand . ) NARRATOR Romaine Patterson 's sister , Trish Steger : TRISH STEGER As soon as they started jury selection , you know , everybody was coming into my shop with " I do n't want to be on this trial . I hope they do n't call me . " Or , " Oh my God , I 've been called . How do I get off ? " Just wanting to get as far away from it as they could very fearful that they were going to have to be part of that jury.And then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question the prospective jurors . And one of the questions that they ask is : Would you be willing to put this person to death ? And I understand that a lot of the comments were : " Yes , I would . " JUROR Yes , I would , Your Honor . JUROR Yes , sir . JUROR Absolutely . JUROR Yes , sir ! ( Jurors continue underneath . ) JUROR No problem . JUROR Yep . TRISH STEGER Well , can you imagine hearing that ? You know , juror after juror after juror p. 88 Act 3 , Scene 3 : Moment : Russell Henderson MOMENT : RUSSELL HENDERSON ( " Amazing Grace " begins again . ) JUDGE You entered a not guilty plea earlier , Mr. Henderson . But I understand you wish to change your plea today . Is that correct ? RUSSELL HENDERSON Yes , sir . JUDGE You understand , Mr. Henderson , that the recommended sentence here is two life sentences ? RUSSELL HENDERSON Yes , sir . JUDGE Do you understand that those may run concurrently or they may run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henderson , I will now ask you how you wish to plead . Guilty or not guilty ? RUSSELL HENDERSON Guilty . JUDGE Before the Court decides whether the sentences will be concurrent or consecutive , I understand that there are statements to be made by at least one individual . NARRATOR This is an excerpt from a statement made to the court by Lucy Thompson . LUCY THOMPSON As the grandmother and the person who raised Russell , along with my family , we have written the following statement : Our hearts ache for the pain and suffering that the Shepards have went through . We have prayed for your family since the very beginning . Many times throughout the day I have thought about Matt . And you will continue to be in our thoughts and prayers , as we know that your pain will never go away . You have showed such mercy in allowing us to have this plea , and we are so grateful that you are giving us all the opportunity to live . Your Honor , we , as a family , hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurrently two life terms . For the Russell we know and love , we humbly plead , Your Honor , to not take Russell completely out of our lives forever . p. 89 JUDGE Thank you . Mr. Henderson , you have a constitutional right to make a statement if you would like to do so . Do you have anything you would like to say ? RUSSELL HENDERSON Yes , I would , Your Honor . Mr. and Mrs. Shepard , there is not a moment that goes by that I do n't see what happened that night . I know what I did was very wrong , and I regret greatly what I did . You have my greatest sympathy for what happened . I hope that one day you will be able to find it in your hearts to forgive me . Your Honor , I know what I did was wrong . I 'm very sorry for what I did , and I 'm ready to pay my debt for what I did . JUDGE Mr. Henderson , you drove the vehicle that took Matthew Shepard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order that he might be more savagely beaten and in order that he might not escape to tell his tale . You left him out there for eighteen hours , knowing full well that he was there , perhaps having an opportunity to save his life , and you did nothing . Mr. Henderson , this Court does not believe that you really feel any true remorse for your part in this matter . And I wonder , Mr. Henderson , whether you fully realize the gravity of what you 've done.The Court finds it appropriate , therefore , that sentence be ordered as follows : As to Count Three , that being felony murder with robbery , you are to serve a period of imprisonment for the term of your natural life . On Count One , kidnapping , that you serve a period of imprisonment for the term of your natural life . Sentencing for Count One to run consecutive to sentencing for Count Three . p. 90 NARRATOR After the hearing , we spoke with Russell Henderson 's Mormon home teacher . MORMON HOME TEACHER I 've known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-one , so I 've known him his entire life . I ordained Russell a priest of the Mormon Church , so when this happened , you can imagine  --  disbelief . After the sentencing the church held a disciplinary council , and the result of that meeting was to excommunicate Russell from the Mormon Church . And what that means is that your name is taken off the records of the church , so you just disappear.Russell 's reaction to that was not positive , it hurt him , it hurt him to realize how serious a transgression he had committed.But I will not desert Russell . That 's a matter of my religion and my friendship with the family . ( All exit . Lights fade on RUSSELL , his grandmother , and his home teacher. ) p. 91 Act 3 , Scene 4 : Moment : Angels in America MOMENT : ANGELS IN AMERICA NARRATOR Before we left Laramie , we met again with Rebecca Hilliker at the theater department . She is producing Angels in America this year at the university . REBECCA HILLIKER I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a lot of work to do . That we have an obligation to find ways to reach our students . And the question is , How do we move  --  how do we reach a whole state where there is some really deep-seated hostility toward gays ? How do you reach them ? This is the beginning and guess who 's auditioning for the lead ? JEDADIAH SCHULTZ MY PARENTS ! NARRATOR Jedadiah Schultz : JEDADIAH SCHULTZ My parents were like , " So what plays are you doing this year at school ? " And I was like , " Angels in America , " and I told them the whole list of plays . And they 're like , " Angels in America ? Is that that play you did in high school ? That scene you did in high school ? " And I was like , " Yeah . " And she goes : " Huh . So are you gon na audition for it ? " And I was like , " Yeah . " And we got in this huge argument and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on is it was just after they had seen me in a performance of Macbeth , and onstage like I murdered like a little kid , and Lady Macduff and these two other guys and like and she goes , " Well , you know homosexuality is a sin "  --  she kept saying that  --  and I go , " Mom , I just played a murderer tonight . And you did n't seem to have a problem with that " I tell you . I 've never prepared myself this much for an audition in my life . Never ever . Not even close . p. 92 ROB DEBREE Not having to deal that much with the gay society here in Laramie . NARRATOR Detective Sergeant Rob DeBree : ROB DEBREE Well , once we started working into the case , and actually speaking to the people that were gay and finding out what their underlying fears were , well , then it sort of hit home . This is America . You do n't have the right to feel that fear.And we 're still going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably one of them fourteen months ago . I 'm not gon na put up with it , and I 'm not going to listen to it . And if they do n't like my views on it , fine . The door goes both ways . I already lost a couple of buddies . I do n't care . I feel more comfortable and I can sleep at night . REGGIE FLUTY Well , you 're tested every three months . NARRATOR Reggie Fluty : REGGIE FLUTY And I was able to have the DNA test done . And so they got me to Fort Collins , they drew the blood there , flew it to Michigan , and did all the DNA work there and  --  which was  --  a week later I knew I was negative for good . MARGE MURRAY I 'll tell ya , we were all on our knees saying Hail Marys . REGGIE FLUTY You were just elated , you know , and you think , " Thank God ! " p. 93 MARGE MURRAY So what 's the first thing she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's mouth . I was just happy , you know , you 're just so happy . You think , " Yeah , I hope I did this service well , " you know , I hope I did it with some kind of integrity . So , you 're just really happy and my daughters just bawled . MARGE MURRAY They were so happy . REGGIE FLUTY And the force MARGE MURRAY Oh boy REGGIE FLUTY We went out and got shitfaced . MARGE MURRAY ( Simultaneous ) Shitfaced . REGGIE FLUTY They all bought me drinks too , it was great and everybody hugged and cried , and , you know , I kissed everybody who walked through the door MARGE MURRAY Reggie , they do n't need to know that . REGGIE FLUTY I did n't care if they were male or female , they each got a kiss on the lips .

REGGIE FLUTY Oh , get over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 : Moment : A Death Penalty Case MOMENT : A DEATH PENALTY CASE NARRATOR Almost a year to the day that Matthew Shepard died , the trial for Aaron James McKinney was set to begin . CAL RERUCHA Probably the question that most of you have in your mind is ah , ah , how the McKinney case will proceed . NARRATOR Cal Rerucha , prosecuting attorney : CAL RERUCHA And it 's the decision of the county attorney 's office that that will definitely be a death penalty case . MARGE MURRAY Part of me wants McKinney to get it . But I 'm not very proud of that . I was on and off , off and on . I ca n't say what I would do I 'm too personally involved . ZACKIE SALMON Oh , I believe in the death penalty one hundred percent . You know , because I want to make sure that guy 's ass dies . This is one instance where I truly believe with all my heart an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . MATT MICKELSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't ever want to see them ever walk out of Rawlins Penitentiary . I 'll pay my nickel , or whatever , my little percentage of tax , nickel a day to make sure that his ass stays in there and never sees society again and definitely never comes into my bar again . p. 95 MATT GALLOWAY I do n't believe in the death penalty . It 's too much for me . I do n't believe that one person should be killed as redemption for his having killed another . Two wrongs do n't make a right . ZUBAIDA ULA How can I protest , if the Shepards want McKinney dead ? I just ca n't interfere in that . But on a personal level , I knew Aaron in grade school . We never called him Aaron , he was called A.J. How can we put A.J. McKinney  --  how can we put A.J. McKinney to death ? FATHER ROGER SCHMIT I think right now our most important teachers must be Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney . They have to be our teachers . How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach you that ? See , I do n't know if many people will let them be their teachers . I think it would be wonderful if the judge said : " In addition to your sentence , you must tell your story , you must tell your story . " BAILIFF All rise . State of Wyoming versus Aaron James McKinney , docket number 6381 . The Honorable Barton R. Voigt presiding . The Court is in session . p. 96 Act 3 , Scene 6 : Moment : Aaron McKinney MOMENT : AARON MCKINNEY NARRATOR During the trial of Aaron McKinney , the prosecution played a tape recording of his confession . ROB DEBREE My name is Rob DeBree , sergeant for the Sheriff 's Office . You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and may be used against you in a court of law . NARRATOR The following is an excerpt of that confession . ROB DEBREE Okay , so you guys , you and Russ go to the Fireside . So you 're at the Fireside by yourselves , right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go after you leave the Fireside ? AARON MCKINNEY Some kid wanted a ride home . ROB DEBREE What 's he look like ? AARON MCKINNEY Mmm , like a queer . Such a queer dude . ROB DEBREE He looks like a queer ? AARON MCKINNEY Yeah , like a fag , you know ? ROB DEBREE Okay . How did you meet him ? AARON MCKINNEY He wanted a ride home and I just thought , well , the dude 's drunk , let 's just take him home . p. 97 ROB DEBREE When did you and Russ talk about jacking him up ? AARON MCKINNEY We kinda talked about it at the bar . ROB DEBREE Okay , what happened next ? AARON MCKINNEY We drove him out past Wal-Mart . We got over there , and he starts grabbing my leg and grabbing my genitals . I was like , " Look , I 'm not a fuckin ' faggot . If you touch me again you 're gon na get it . " I do n't know what the hell he was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I killed him . ROB DEBREE What 'd you beat him with ? AARON MCKINNEY Blacked out . My fist . My pistol . The butt of the gun . Wondering what happened to me . I had a few beers and , I do n't know . It 's like I could see what was going on , but I do n't know , but I do n't know , it was like somebody else was doing it . ROB DEBREE What was the first thing that he said or that he did in the truck that made you hit him ? AARON MCKINNEY Well , he put his hand on my leg , slid his hand like as if he was going to grab my balls . p. 98 Act 3 , Scene 7 : Moment : Gay Panic MOMENT : GAY PANIC ZACKIE SALMON When that defense team argued that McKinney did what he did because Matthew made a pass at him I just wanted to vomit , because that 's like saying that it 's okay . It 's like the " Twinkle Defense , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing . REBECCA HILLIKER As much as , uh , part of me did n't want the defense of them saying that it was a gay bashing or that it was gay panic , part of me is really grateful . Because I was really scared that in the trial they were going to try and say that it was a robbery , or it was about drugs . So when they used " gay panic " as their defense , I felt , this is good , if nothing else the truth is going to be told the truth is coming out . p. 99 Act 3 , Scene 8 : Moment : Aaron McKinney MOMENT : AARON MCKINNEY ( continued ) ROB DEBREE Did he ever try to defend himself against you or hit you back ? AARON MCKINNEY Yeah , sort of . He tried his little swings or whatever but he was n't very effective . ROB DEBREE Okay . How many times did you hit him inside the truck before you guys stopped where you left him ? AARON MCKINNEY I 'd say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my fists and about six times with the pistol . ROB DEBREE Did he ask you to stop ? AARON MCKINNEY Well , yeah . He was getting the shit kicked out of him . ROB DEBREE What did he say ? AARON MCKINNEY After he asked me to stop most all he was doing was screaming . ROB DEBREE So Russ kinda dragged him over to the fence , I 'm assuming , and tied him up ? AARON MCKINNEY Something like that . I just remember Russ was laughing at first but then he got pretty scared . ROB DEBREE Was Matthew conscious when Russ tied him up ? p. 100 AARON MCKINNEY Yeah . I told him to turn around and do n't look at my license plate number ' cause I was scared he would tell the police . And then I asked him what my license plate said . He read it and that 's why I hit him a few more times . ROB DEBREE Just to be sure ? ( Pause ) So obviously you do n't like gay people ? AARON MCKINNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you hate them ? AARON MCKINNEY Uh , I really do n't hate them but , you know , when they start coming on to me and stuff like that I get pretty aggravated . ROB DEBREE Did he threaten you ? AARON MCKINNEY This gay dude ? ROB DEBREE Yeah . AARON MCKINNEY Not really . ROB DEBREE Can you answer me one thing ? Why 'd you guys take his shoes ? AARON MCKINNEY I do n't know . ( Pause ) Now I 'm never going to see my son again . ROB DEBREE I do n't know . You 'll probably go to court sometime today . AARON MCKINNEY Today ? So I 'm gon na go in there and just plead guilty or not guilty today ? p. 101 ROB DEBREE No , no , you 're just going to be arraigned today . AARON MCKINNEY He is gon na die for sure ? ROB DEBREE There is no doubt that Mr. Shepard is going to die . AARON MCKINNEY So what are they going to give me , twenty-five to life or just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not our job . That 's the judge 's job and the jury . p. 102 Act 3 , Scene 9 : Moment : The Verdict MOMENT : THE VERDICT NARRATOR Has the jury reached a verdict ? FOREPERSON We have , Your Honor.We the jury , impaneled and sworn to try the above entitled case , after having well and truly tried the matter , unanimously find as follows:As to the charge of kidnapping , we find the defendant , Aaron James McKinney , guilty.As to the charge of aggravated robbery , we find the defendant , Aaron James McKinney , guilty.As to the charge of first-degree felony murder ( kidnapping ) , we find the defendant , Aaron James McKinney , guilty .

That evening , Judy and Dennis Shepard were approached by McKinney 's defense team , who pled for their client 's life . The following morning , Dennis Shepard made a statement to the Court . Here is some of what he said . DENNIS SHEPARD My son Matthew did not look like a winner . He was rather uncoordinated and wore braces from the age of thirteen until the day he died . However , in his all too brief life he proved that he was a winner . On October 6 , 1998 , my son tried to show the world that he could win again . On October 12 , 1998 , my firstborn son and my hero lost . On October 12 , 1998 , my firstborn son and my hero died , fifty days before his twenty-second birthday.I keep wondering the same thing that I did when I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become ? How could he have changed his piece of the world to make it better ? Matt officially died in a hospital in Fort Collins , Colorado . He actually died on the outskirts of Laramie , tied to a fence . You , Mr. McKinney , with your friend Mr. Henderson left him out there by himself , but he was n't alone . There were his lifelong friends with him , friends that he had grown up with . You 're probably wondering who these friends were . First he had the beautiful night sky and the same stars and moon that we used to see through a telescope . Then he had the daylight and the sun to shine on him . And through it all he was breathing in the scent of pine trees from the snowy range . He heard the wind , the ever-present Wyoming wind , for the last time . He had one more friend with him , he had God . And ! feel better knowing he was n't alone . Matt 's beating , hospitalization , and funeral focused worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People have said enough is enough . I miss my son , but I am proud to be able to say that he is my son.Judy has been quoted as being against the death penalty . It has been stated that Matt was against the death penalty . Both of these statements are wrong . Matt believed that there were crimes and incidents that justified the death penalty . I too believe in the death penalty . I would like nothing better than to see you die , Mr. McKinney . However , this is the time to begin the healing process . To show mercy to someone who refused to show any mercy . Mr. McKinney , I am going to grant you life , as hard as it is for me to do so , because of Matthew . Every time you celebrate Christmas , a birthday , the Fourth of July , remember that Matt is n't . Every time you wake up in your prison cell , remember that you had the opportunity and the ability to stop your actions that night . You robbed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for that . Mr. McKinney , I give you life in the memory of one who no longer lives . May you have a long life , and may you thank Matthew every day for it . p. 104 p. 105 Act 3 , Scene 11 : Moment : Aftermath MOMENT : AFTERMATH REGGIE FLUTY Me and DeBree hugged and cried . And , you know , everybody had tears in their eyes , and you 're just so thankful , you know , and Mr. Shepard was cryin ' , and then that got me bawlin ' and everybody just  --  ROB DEBREE This is all we 've lived and breathed for a year . Daily . This has been my case daily . And now it 's over . REGGIE FLUTY Maybe now we can go on and we can quit being stuck , you know ? AARON KREIFELS It just hit me today , the minute that I got out of the courthouse . That the reason that God wanted me to find him is , for he did n't have to die out there alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , they would n't of found him for a couple of weeks at least . So it makes me feel really good that he did n't have to die out there alone . MATT GALLOWAY I 'm just glad it 's over . I really am . Testifying in that trial was one of the hardest things I 've ever done . And do n't get me wrong , I love the stage , I really do , I love it . But it 's tricky , because basically what you have is lawyers questioning you from this angle but the answers need to be funneling this way , to the jury . So what you have to do is establish a funneling system . And that 's hard for me because I 'm a natural conversationalist , so it 's just natural instinct that when someone asks you a question , you look at that person to make eye contact . But it 's kind of tough when you literally have to scoot over  --  change your position , in effect , funnel over to where the jury is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the course of my testimony . ( Everyone is amused and baffled by this last text. )
