James <p> " So , are you going to take me back to your place , or are we going to make Benny rich by running up a ridiculous bar tab ? " Crystal whispered seductively . <p> Her eyes traveled over my body , stopping a little below my belt as she took a sip of her drink . This was her way of letting me know that she was ready . The next move was mine , and her body language was begging me to make it . She lifted her head , her eyes meeting mine as she put her drink on the bar . I smiled , giving her my own once-over . I could n't help but respond with a devilish grin as I placed my hand on the small of her back , high enough to be respectable but low enough to have an effect . She shuddered slightly under my touch , even though her face failed to give anything away . <p> We had n't seen each other in almost a year , and probably would n't see each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keisha became pregnant in the next few months . Crystal had traveled back to New York from Richmond , Virginia , for Darnel 's wedding , which was tomorrow night . We 'd met at Benny 's bar , one of our old neighborhood haunts , to catch up on old times after the rehearsal dinner . <p> " So ? " she asked again , this time with a little more desperation in her voice . She wanted me . She wanted me bad . She wanted me to do what only I could do for her-satisfy that sexual itch that nobody else seemed able to reach . I know it sounds rather arrogant , but I 'd been sleeping with this woman off and on for the better part of twenty-eight years , so I knew what she needed in the bedroom , just like she knew what I needed . <p> I glanced at her again . Even in a conservative pantsuit , she had a way of enticing me . Her face was a beautiful bronze color , highlighted by a beauty mark right above the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds over the years , and her hair showed a hint of gray around the edges , but hell , whose did n't ? Besides , truth be told , I liked a woman with some meat on her bones and some mileage on her engine . Experience meant a lot in life , especially in the bedroom . <p> She turned her head slightly , exposing a small tattoo with the letters DB , our son 's initials , on the lower side of her neck . A memory of the way she cooed when I kissed her neck came to mind . Then I looked down at her chest , and the thought of her neck was quickly replaced with an image of her large , plump breasts and the silver-dollar nipples that rested atop them . My heart rate increased , and my breathing became heavier . It never mattered where I touched her ; Crystal 's body was so sexually in tune with mine that I did n't even have to take off my clothes to give her an orgasm . Oh , but when I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few women I 'd ever known . Having a child together bonded us , but it was the sex that kept us hungering for each other year after year . <p> She licked her lips , and my manhood sprang to life . I flicked my wrist so I could see the time on my watch . I was wondering if Crystal was planning on a quickie or one of our all-night marathons . I 'd already canceled a date to meet with her , so an all-nighter with someone of her sexual prowess was fine by me . That , of course , left only one question . <p> " Where 's your husband ? " I asked , getting straight to the point . <p> Crystal looked annoyed by my question . Yes , she was married , going on five years now , and she definitely preferred that I did n't mention her husband when we were getting ready to get busy . We both knew that her marital status really was n't a factor in all this anyway . We 'd played this game before , Crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't make any excuses for the fact that she was a woman who needed a man in her life . She always said that she would prefer it if that man were me , but after a while , she stopped holding her breath and moved on . <p> One thing was for sure , though : It did n't matter who she was with . If we saw each other or had the chance to talk on the phone , it was never a question of if we were going to get together , but rather when and where it would happen . <p> " He had to work third shift . He 'll be here sometime early tomorrow morning . " Crystal slid off her bar stool and folded her arms as if to say , " So , come on . We got time , but we ai n't got all night . " I knew her well , and she was not about to take no for an answer . And as good as she was looking , I was n't about to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to respect me in the morning , " I teased . <p> She did n't laugh . Instead , she came back with , " Please . You my baby daddy . I ai n't got to respect you . " Unfortunately , I knew she was n't joking , and her words stung like hell . <p> " You do n't ? " <p> " Hell no . Everybody knows you ai n't shit , James . As much as I love our son , I should have never had a baby with you . " She 'd been using this same line on me since Darnel was a baby , and now here he was , a grown man getting ready to get married and have babies of his own . Jesus , I was getting old . <p> " Then why do you want me to take you home ? Why do you keep sleeping with me after all these years ? You tryin ' to say you ai n't got no love for me ? " <p> " Please , James . You broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more ways than I will ever forget . I 'd be a fool if I still had love for you . " <p> " If you ai n't got love for me , then why are you trying to sleep with me ? " <p> " Good dick is hard to come by , " she said , like it was a simple fact of life that everyone understood . " And you 've got some really good dick . Now , are you going to sit here and debate it , or are you gon na take me home and remind me why I rented a car and drove seven hours up here instead of waiting for my husband so we could drive together ? " <p> I reached in my pocket and pulled out a twenty-dollar bill . I slapped it down on the bar , nodding my head . <p> " You know me . Last thing I want is for anyone to make a seven-hour trip in vain , " I said with a laugh . The truth of her words could have deflated my desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to waste on being overly sensitive or sentimental . Besides , I 'd known this woman my entire adult life , and there was n't a thing she could say that I had n't heard at least a dozen times before . We were too far past that nanve stage to believe we 'd ever be anything more than what we were today . <p> Crystal leaned in and kissed my full lips , then smiled as if I had just given her a large sum of money . The way she stared at me made my manhood grow , making it clear that I was the one about to hit the jackpot . In less than twenty minutes , we 'd both be in my bed , as naked as the day we were born , making love like there was no tomorrow . And as it had always been between the two of us , there would be no tomorrow-only a here and now . <p> Five hours later , Crystal was snoring with a purpose , her back to my chest and her round hips and ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in about ten minutes for another round . She would have to leave after that in order to make it back to her hotel before her husband showed up . Part of me did n't want her to leave , because I was having such a good time . I always had a good time when Crystal and I got together . <p> I stared at her face as I stroked her sweaty hair . We 'd gone at it for the better part of an hour-twice . The way she called out my name and told me that this would always be her dick was definitely good for the ego . It also told me that after all these years , no matter what she said , she was still in love with me . <p> Crystal had sacrificed most of her adult years chasing after me . We 'd met right after high school . I was far from being faithful , but she was as close to a steady girlfriend as I had during those days . <p> She looked out for me when no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best interest . There was n't anything Crystal Jackson would n't do for me . I knew that better than anyone on this earth , and the thing that haunted me the most was that she wanted only one thing in return : my love . But as much as I tried , I just could n't give it to her the way she wanted it . <p> Like most women , she wanted to be a wife much more than a girlfriend . Do n't get me wrong ; I liked her , but I was n't having no part of getting married . I was having too much fun with all the other women in my life . Crystal , on the other hand , would n't take no for an answer . As far as she was concerned , she was in love with me , and all I needed was a little coaxing to understand that I loved her too . She was so convinced of this that she got pregnant , hoping it would settle me down enough for us to get married . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fool even more . It was something I wished could have been changed , but I still had no regrets . I 'd had a good life , a fun life . Why would I mess it up by getting married ? <p> " I 'm sorry , " I whispered . <p> " Huh ? " She lifted her head . " What did you say ? " <p> " Ah , nothing . " I leaned over and kissed her cheek . <p> She rolled over to face me . " If you 're gon na kiss me , kiss me right . " <p> I smiled as I studied her face through the dim light that peeked between the curtains . She really was beautiful , and I 'd never seen a woman age so well . <p> I pressed my lips against hers , and our kiss became passionate . My hands roamed her body hungrily . Just as she mounted me for another round , my bedroom door flew open and blinding light flooded the room . <p> Crystal dove under the covers to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , squinting my eyes to adjust to the bright light as I saw what looked like a woman standing in my doorway . In that brief moment , my mind went into overdrive , trying to understand who had just broken into my house . It could have been one of any number of women I 'd been seeing over the past few months-but most likely the one I had broken a date with to meet Crystal . But how the hell had she gotten into my house ? <p> The woman yelled , " I knew you was here with her ! " and suddenly I knew who the intruder was . This was n't just any woman standing in my doorway . This was a woman I loved with all my heart , but when it came to me pursuing my love life , she could be described with only one word : trouble . <p> Chapter Two Darnel <p> " Well , tomorrow 's the big day . You 're really gon na go through with it , are n't you ? " <p> I smiled , nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slid my key into the door of my hotel room and pushed it open . We 'd just left what was quite possibly the best bachelor party ever thrown , and we were both drunk . I plopped down on the first of two queen-sized beds while Omar stumbled toward the bathroom to relieve himself . I did n't know about Omar , but I was tired , both mentally and physically drained from preparing for my big day tomorrow and from celebrating my last night as a single man with my boys . <p> Omar , who was my best man , had gone all out , inviting all our friends , along with six of the wildest strippers I 'd ever seen . They were more like erotic circus performers than strippers , with all the contortions and tricks they showed us . Add them to the top-shelf liquor our friend Reggie supplied and Bam ! One hell of a bachelor party . <p> " You know , Dee , " Omar slurred as he stood in the bathroom , " I never thought you 'd really go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all , but ... " He paused . I heard him say " Ahhhh , " followed by the sound of him relieving himself . <p> " Man , will you close the door ? Do n't nobody wan na hear you peeing . " I loved Omar like the brother I never had , but he could really be disgusting sometimes . Some might even call him repulsive . <p> " Do n't get your panties in a bunch . I 'm done now . " He walked out of the bathroom with his zipper down and his pants hanging off his ass , exposing his plaid boxers . I did n't bother to remind him to wash his hands , because , like I said , he could be a little raw . <p> " So , what were you saying about me getting married ? You did n't think I was gon na do it ? Man , I been with that woman since I was fifteen years old . That pussy is bought and paid for . I ai n't got no choice but to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the truth was , I loved Keisha with all my heart . <p> " Yeah , I know that , and you been faithful to her since you was fifteen . But what I wan na know is , do you really want to die having been with only one woman ? " His expression made it look as if he felt sorry for me . I hated that look . <p> " You act like me being faithful is a bad thing . " <p> This conversation was nothing new to me . Omar and my boys had always thought me strange because of my faithfulness to Keisha . The way they saw it , a man was supposed to get as much experience as he could with as many women as were willing to give it up . But I viewed things differently . I had given my virginity and pledged my faithfulness to Keisha , and I was n't about to hurt her by cheating with some woman who did n't mean anything to me . My father had done that to my mother . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the hurt in her eyes over and over again , so I vowed never to do that to the woman I loved . It just was n't worth it to me . <p> " Nah , it ai n't a bad thing , " he conceded , " just unrealistic . Besides , with that chick Tia as her maid of honor , who knows what they 're doing across the street at her bachelorette party . " Omar sat down on the bed across from me with a strange look on his face-like he had something important to say but could n't find the words . He was starting to piss me off . " Dee , I heard Tia hired male strippers for Keisha 's bachelorette party . Who knows what Keisha could be- " <p> I cut him off right there . " Look , bro , Keisha ai n't Tia , just like I 'm not you ! You got that ? " <p> " You think our strippers had big titties ? Can you imagine how big those male strippers ' dicks are ? Stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omar was my boy , but he was really pushing the limit tonight . " You 're drunk , so I 'm gon na ignore that . But , O , you better check yourself , " I warned him . <p> He laughed , but I wanted him to understand that I was serious . The night before my wedding was not the time for him to be disrespecting my fiancTe like this . I loved that woman more than I loved myself . <p> " I 'm just saying ... do you really think you 're the only guy Keisha has ever been with ? " <p> I stood up and pointed my finger in his face . " Best friend or not , do n't come out your face like that about her again or I'll- " <p> " Or you 'll what ? Man , sit your ass down . " He laughed . " What you gon na do , fight your best man for trying to get you some pussy the night of your bachelor party ? " He shook his head . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know why you got ta disrespect me before my wedding . " <p> He was still smiling , but he had stopped laughing . I think he could finally see that I was upset . " Yo , Dee , I 'm sorry , man . I meant no disrespect , but- " <p> " You need to shut that drunk-ass mouth of yours , then . " <p> " You right , I 'm drunk , " he admitted , still smiling at me . " And maybe I should be quiet . But just remember , drunk people usually tell the truth . So I 'm telling you , Darnel , you need to get some ass before you get married . I could set it up like that . " He snapped his fingers . <p> I was amazed at how persistent Omar was . He knew damn well that Keisha was my life , so he was wasting his time trying to convince me to cheat on her . <p> I lay down on the bed . " Ca n't do it , buddy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't such a one-woman man when that stripper was giving you that lap dance in the corner , were you ? " Omar 's smile widened . " I saw the way you was trying to hide your hard dick once she got off of you . " He imitated my actions , crossing his arms casually over his lap . <p> I turned my head away so he would n't see my smirk . I had indeed been turned on by the honey-colored stripper who called herself Destiny . She had coaxed me into a lap dance when I thought everyone was watching the other strippers do tricks . I 'd be lying if I said I did n't enjoy it . But that still did n't mean I wanted to have sex with her . <p> " You saw that , huh ? " I said . <p> " Yeah , I saw it . So did half the other brothers in the room . " <p> " Jesus Christ . " I was so embarrassed . <p> " What 's wrong with you ? It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dick not supposed to get hard when a fine-ass naked woman sits on your lap ? I 'd be worried if it did n't . " Omar smiled as he tried once again to tempt me to get laid by another woman on the night before my wedding . " You could n't keep your eyes off that fine-ass honey the rest of the night , could you ? " <p> " You just do n't understand . Keisha is my soul mate . I 'm not supposed to be attracted to any other woman that way . I made a promise , and I 'm keeping it . " <p> " No , you do n't understand . " Omar paced back and forth like a lawyer delivering a passionate closing argument . " I mean , I appreciate that being faithful shit , but you take it to another level . You need to have some fun , Dee . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
