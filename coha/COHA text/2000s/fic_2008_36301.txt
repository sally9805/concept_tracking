The Inventory <p> It 's an immense and grand ledger : clasps plated in gold , cut jewels set along the spine , elaborate tooling to ornament the black stuff in which it is bound . All the same , it 's a rather unpleasant- looking thing . <p> You can handle it , if you like , but you wo n't like the slightly clammy texture of the black stuff ; you wo n't like the weight of the book in your hands , heavier than it ought to be . <p> You can open it , if you like , and try to read the iron- red text . You wo n't be able to read it , though , not without your eyes watering , and the disconcerting hieroglyphs will call to mind snakes , whips , thorns , claws . After a few pages you will notice the smell , which will disturb you to the foundation of your consciousness . <p> It is a slave registry . <p> It was not made by any crude band of conquerors , if that 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have created anything this carefully made , nor would they have the meticulous patience to cut the point , dip the pen in-ink ? - and write the history of each unfortunate soul . . . <p> 4th day 3rd week 7th month in the 230th year from the Ascent of the Mountain . This day , flesh salvaged from the eastern face . Initially routed to Larder . Vitality detected ; rerouted to Experimental Medicine and registered as Slave 4372301 . <p> He opened his eyes to unrelieved blackness . Was he dead ? He felt nothing . The last memory was of screaming air and blinding light , and a sense of regret as he 'd fallen . He 'd come so far up the ice wall , and before that so far through the passes , that it seemed a shame to die from simple clumsiness . But his frozen hands had failed him , and so . . . <p> Dead , then . Was this the womb of the earth ? Not the way he had imagined it . He had thought it would be full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , which was nothing . No light , no sound , no sensation of cold or heat . <p> The bleak thought surfaced : Perhaps the earth would not have you . Gard considered that prospect and resigned himself . <p> It was something of an anticlimax , then , when the light appeared . It flared , it danced like yellow leaves . He started , and every nerve in his body shrieked to life . He wept in pain as the light grew brighter . It was nearing him . He could hear , now , a clanking sort of noise , echoing , and the echoing of footsteps . Now and again the light paused , but always it came on again . <p> It resolved into a man . He wore the light in a thing like an openwork basket , mounted on his head . He was carrying a . . . water gourd ? He wore a harness and woven stuff , like one of the Riders , but he did not look like a Rider . His skin was the color of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if Gard had been able to move his arm . <p> He stopped and thrust his head in Gard 's direction , in an interrogatory way . When he saw Gard looking back at him , he grinned . <p> " Hhhhnaaaii ! " he said . Something popped into existence at his shoulder , the image of a burning child , and it moved its lips and spoke when he spoke again . " The big icicle is awake ! " <p> Or , at least , that was what Gard understood him to say . Meaningless syllables sounded , but within his ear another voice spoke with meaning . Gard tried to answer him and could only sob . <p> " Yes , I daresay you would cry ! I 'd cry too , if I was in your condition . Cheer up , though ; Magister Hoptriot thinks he will save your legs . Then you 'll be lots of use . Always good to be of use , eh ? " The man set down the- gourd ? No , but it was like a gourd-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end into a wooden frame that held Gard 's arm prisoner , and Gard felt a sting in his arm , a tiny spark out of the flaming pain that consumed him . He looked at himself by the light . All bandages , and stinking salve . <p> The man set the gourd-like thing down and looked Gard over . " Poor icicle . The medicine hurts , yes ? Here 's what you need . " He pulled from a pouch at his waist a handful of leaves . They were green , nearly fresh , only a little limp with having been in the man 's pouch . He thrust them between Gard 's teeth . " You chew . Soon , you wo n't care about the hurt . " <p> Gard did as he was told , rolling the leaves into a quid with his tongue . kage baker Almost at once his tongue went numb , and then his mouth ; the numbness spread down from there , merciful as cool water . The man squatted , watching him . He chuckled . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy ? " <p> " Am I dead ? " said Gard thickly . <p> " No , not dead ! By the grace of the masters , alive . You came a long way through the snow . What were you doing ? " <p> Gard summoned memory . " Looking for a way through . " <p> " Ahhh ! To the cities on the other side ? " <p> Gard looked at the man in incomprehension , wondering what cities might be , and the flaming child at the man 's shoulder fretted and danced , and at last a tiny voice spoke in Gard 's head : **29;1687;TOOLONG of people . <p> " Too bad . You 're here now , " said the man . He laughed and shook his head . " It 's not so bad . I used to break my heart that I was n't back there , and then one day I thought , what would I be doing if I was back there ? Scrambling to find a crust to eat , a place to sleep . Do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed , at least . " He smacked his thighs and stood . <p> " Yes , you 'll get better . You 're strong . I heard they found you wrapped in a white bear 's pelt ! Did you kill it yourself ? " <p> Bear ? Gard had a hazy memory of the white thing that had come down the slope at him , an avalanche on four legs . He had run his spear down its throat and then leaped on its back and locked his arms about its neck . . . blood steaming on the snow , and how grateful he had been for the warmth of its carcass as he skinned it . A demon of the snows , he had assumed . Had that been a bear ? The burning child bounced in place , affirmed the word . <p> " But of course you must have killed it yourself . Nice ! One of the mistresses claimed that pelt , very pleased she was too . I heard that story , I said to myself , ' This is a strong one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chattered on . <p> " How are you talking in two voices ? " Gard asked . <p> " Eh ? " <p> " The fire- baby that talks in my head , " said Gard , unable to point at it . " What is it ? " <p> " That ? Why , that 's only a Translator . Clever , eh ? Otherwise I should n't have any idea what your jungle talk meant , and I 'll bet you never learned the speech of the Children of the Sun . " The man grinned wide . <p> Children of the Sun ? " Is that what you are ? " <p> " Yes , of course ! " <p> " Is that what the people here are ? " <p> The man 's grin faded . " No . " He turned and looked over his shoulder into the darkness . " No , only a few of us here . And long , and so long since I 've seen the sun . But it 's better than dying , eh ? Food and a bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your medicine doing , eh ? All drained in ? " <p> Too many new things to understand . And why bother to try , when the numbness and the blindness were so pleasant ? Gard floated away into darkness and never felt the needle removed from his arm . <p> He felt nothing until a long while later , when there was brightness in his face again . <p> The pain returned with the light . He was being hoisted from the place where he lay , someone gripping him around the legs and someone catching him around the shoulders . He gulped for breath and gave a hoarse scream at the pain . <p> " Easy with him . Poor old icicle , I 'll bet that hurt , eh ? Ca n't give you the leaf for the pain , so sorry ; Magister Hoptriot wants a look at you , and he wants you conscious . You be good and you 'll have some later , eh ? Old Triphammer promises you . " <p> Gard looked around frantically as he was swung down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so did two dark giants who crouched , one at his head and one at his feet , and lifted him . He was slung between them on a litter , such as people used to drag the sick , the dying . He was carried forward through the darkness , as the man with the light trotted alongside . Triphammer ? The burning child showed him a picture of the man with the light . Perhaps that was his name . <p> Now he could see , in the halo of light that traveled around him , that they were in a long corridor . Now and again they passed grottoes in the rock , shelves upon which other bodies lay . Some were bandaged . Some were unconscious . Some lay watching Gard pass , and their open eyes were glazed , listless , motionless . Others were bound and writhing , turning a restless , furious gaze on Gard as he passed , and they whined in their pain . They were kinds of people he had not seen before . <p> In his terror and disorientation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . what was there to save him ? Not his spear , not his knife : gone down the ice wall forever . Not the strength of his body : melted away . Nothing left but his strength of will . Nothing in his power to do but die bravely . He clenched his fists . He gritted his teeth . <p> The whole jolting way he made no sound , though he thought his kage baker teeth might never unlock again ; he endured . At last he was borne into a room that flared with brilliance painful to his eyes , and he closed them . He was raised , set down on something hard and cold . <p> Deft hands unwound the bandages from his legs and burned like hot iron in their touch . He opened his eyes , not wide , but enough to see Triphammer and two others , the ones who had carried him , standing in a line with their eyes lowered . The bearers were big , their skins the color of slate , their eyes like downcast moons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraped off smooth ; it was gloved and masked in skin too . The eyes domed out like an insect 's . It murmured to itself as it examined him , but no burning child appeared to translate for it . <p> Gard chanced a look at his body . He saw his legs and feet blackened , shriveled , bent . He closed his eyes again , laid his head back , praying for death . Now the voice spoke in his ear : " Are you conscious ? " <p> He opened his eyes again , saw the mask had turned toward him , with a burning child now dancing at its shoulder . " Yes , " he said . <p> " ' Yes , Master , ' is what you 're supposed to say , " Triphammer told him hurriedly . <p> " Will he kill me if I wo n't call him Master ? " said Gard . <p> Triphammer nodded , emphatic . The two big ones raised their eyes , stared at him . <p> " Then rot and eat filth , you slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mask tilted toward him . There was the barest hint of a shrug ; then it took a rag and dipped the rag in a bowl and daubed what was in the bowl on Gard 's feet . The black skin smoked , peeled back , sloughed away . That was the last Gard saw before the darkness fell in on him again . <p> Four moons , lined up , were shining at him out of the starless night . Gard blinked at them , bewildered . The two at the left grew larger , and he felt hot breath in his face . <p> " Rahashpa , gotu , " said a deep voice , and another of the burning children popped into view and lit the grotto . Drink , brother . The two litter bearers stood over him . One was leaning down to offer him a drinking gourd . <p> Gard drank , and gasped for breath . More fire . He had n't thought fire could be liquid . But it warmed , rather than burned , and its aftertaste was pleasant . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . it was the top of a skull . A laugh bubbled up out of his chest . He had n't thought he 'd ever laugh again . <p> " You called the master a slave , " said the nearer of the two silver- eyed , grinning and showing a mouthful of fearsome teeth . " Your testicles are like two heads . " <p> " The heads of enemies swinging at your belt , " added the other . <p> " How we laughed in our hearts , when we heard your words . " <p> " We said to ourselves , surely he is one of us . " <p> " Are you ? " <p> After a moment of confusion , Gard said , " Am I what ? " <p> " One of our kind . But you must be one of our kind . If you were one of the Earthborn , you 'd have died like a lily in the snow . " <p> " But you are strong . We saw the skin of the beast you killed . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two looked at each other , puzzled . They looked at him . " You are a lost child , then . " <p> Gard wondered what that meant . Lost child . . . yes , he had been , had n't he ? A foundling . No one 's son . The one silver- eyed set aside the skull and leaned forward , nodding as though he understood . <p> " Ah , you were abandoned . It happens sometimes . Listen to me , brother : we are born of the Air . But when one of us takes flesh and mates with an Earthborn , or a Fireborn , there are children bred sometimes- " <p> " Earthborn are the slender things who live among the trees- " <p> " Triphammer , he 's one of the Fireborn- " <p> " And you look a little like the Earthborn , but too big , too strong , and your heart is like ours . Welcome , lost child . Not to this filthy place ; but to your own kind . " <p> " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were telling him . He remembered the stories of his childhood . Were they demons , then ? <p> The one with the skull bowl lifted it to Gard 's lips again and then drew back suddenly , the silver moons blazing with emotion . <p> " By the Blue Pit ! The masters do n't know his name ! " <p> The other one came close , leaned down too , spoke in an undertone , with urgency , " Little brother , have you told anyone your name ? " <p> " No , " said Gard . <p> They chortled with laughter , and the one beat his brother 's arm so that the liquor in the skull slopped and smoked where it fell . <p> " Not your true name ? But you were born in flesh . It would be the name you were given by the she that bore you , " said the one with the skull bowl . <p> The memory of all that was past swirled by Gard , like a winter wind . <p> He shuddered and said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , let alone the name she gave me , if she bothered . " <p> The brothers rocked and hugged themselves . <p> " Oh , fortunate boy ! Then no one knows , and there is no way you can be made a slave ! " <p> " They may chain you . They may beat you . But unless the masters know your true name , they may not own you . " <p> " Even in this cell , you are free . Not like us . We must serve them . Poor old Grattur ! " <p> " Poor old Engrattur ! They called us down into flesh with promises of pleasure . " <p> " They gave us food . They made us drunk . " <p> " We were unwise . We told our names . " <p> " Now we are slaves . Now they own our wills . " <p> " Naming calls ; naming owns . " <p> " But you they 'll never call . You they 'll never own ! " <p> " So you are Grattur and Engrattur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two fools , Grattur and Engrattur . If you could see the spells that bind us round , you would wonder how we even breathe . " <p> " Trapped down here to serve them forever , and we can not even die . " <p> " They would only body us again , call us back by our names . " <p> " Body you ? " Gard asked . <p> " Make us bodies again , by craft , and lock us in them- , " said Grattur . They heard footsteps , and then Triphammer looked into the grotto . <p> " What are you doing here ? Icicle needs his rest . What is this , what is this ? Are you making him drunk ? Idiots ! <p> " Grattur showed his teeth . Engrattur took a wad of leaves from a pouch and tucked them into Gard 's mouth . " He 'll rest now , wo n't you , brother ? Remember us , remember our fates . We 're going , hothead ! " <p> They shouldered their way out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hook the medicine into Gard 's arm . <p> " Stupid demons , " he muttered . <p> Am I a demon ? Gard wondered , biting gratefully into the quid . The numbness came again , and the black bliss . <p> It was decided he would live , and so he was moved to a proper chamber ; the grottoes , as Triphammer explained delicately , being more convenient to the Larder in case the seriously ill did n't pull through . <p> The house of the stag " But look what a fine cell you 've been given ! " said Triphammer , arranging the medicine rack above the new bed . " Dry as a bone . And look at all this fine bedstraw ! Sweet as a summer meadow . I 'll tell you , the masters must think you have great potential . My other patients would envy you . You do n't often see slaves given such care , and that 's a fact . " <p> " I 'm not a slave , " said Gard . <p> Triphammer grimaced . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive , and was n't that their doing ? And all your food and drink is their gift . You owe them service , really . After all . And it 's not as though your future is so bleak . See , here 's another gift for you ! " Triphammer delved into a corner of the cell and held up two sticks , each with one end wrapped in rags . " Crutches ! I 'm to teach you to walk with them . Think of being able to get about on your own again , eh ? Why , you might get a little wheeled cart , if you 're diligent at your tasks . <p> " Perhaps even- " He dropped his voice . " There are special rewards for the best slaves , you know . Clever devices , all worked with spells . How 'd you like a pair of silver legs , eh , to replace those poor withered ones ? Set with gems , and strong enough to carry you across the world without tiring ? " <p> The burning child had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all Triphammer 's meaning . But when he understood it at last , he looked scornful . <p> " That 's a story for children . No men can make such things . " <p> " Hai ! And there you 're wrong , my friend , " said Triphammer , grinning . He pulled up a stool and sat . " I 'll tell you a story , and no children 's tale either , but the sacred truth , as I 'm my mother 's son . <p> " Long ago , when there were more gods than men , this black mountain rose up out of the earth . It was the tallest mountain in the world . It scraped the stars at night , raked up a plume of silver dust that trailed from its summit . Green lightnings crackled there , power hummed and danced there . And mages-who are drawn to the smell of power the way cats are drawn to stinking fish-went there and tried to find a way to take the power for their own and use it . <p> " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro cession of mages going up hopeful , with their servants and their baggage and beasts ; coming down broken , with their fine robes in rags , and their rich goods lost to the ice and snow . Every one of them it defeated . The power could not be taken . It would not be owned . <p> " And at last , the cleverest mage among them said , ' No one man can defeat the mountain . Yet , if two or three or ten went together , it might be done . ' <p> " They came together and worked out a spell they thought would mine power from the mountain , as men mine ore from rock . Twenty of them met , twenty , and do you know how hard it is for so many mages to gather in one place , for one purpose ? They 're quarrelsome as cats . But the thought of so much power bound them to set aside their disputations , and one fine day they climbed the mountain , with their servants and their baggage and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wading in snow , complaining . They drew the circle . They lit the braziers and cast on incense . They spilled blood , whose I do n't know , and raised their chant . The power came at their call , it danced around them like green fire , and then- <p> " It bound them ! <p> " It would not be bound , but bound them , all , with their servants and their baggage and their beasts , like a green bowl clamped down . They could not leave . They clawed and screamed at the wall that locked them in , till their fine robes were rags , and their rich goods were no use in the ice and snow . Miserable in the bitter weather they huddled there , and so at last to save their lives they dug into the mountain . <p> " They made tunnels , with their arts ; caves and galleries , grand chambers at last , deeper and deeper always , and so in time made a grand palace under the rock . We are down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you went up , you 'd see the fine rooms ! <p> " And so they made the best of a bad bargain . Devised clever ways of growing food , in chambers lit by witchlight . Cut doors in the lower slopes , through which they still could not go , but other folk could be summoned and lured in to . . . to bring them things they needed . You have to admire them , do n't you ? Now they live like kings and queens , in this palace that might have been a prison . They are famed among mages . " <p> Gard thought about this and could still not see so great a difference between mages and Riders . He saw clearly , though , that there was no use arguing with Triphammer . He said only , " And you came to serve them out of admiration , did you ? " <p> Triphammer winced and looked away . " I was traveling . I lost myself , just as you did . Their servants found me and . . . I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you came from the place on the other side of the mountains ? " <p> " Long ago . Long ago . No use trying to go back now . " <p> " Are there forests there ? " <p> " Eh ? " Triphammer looked up at Gard . " Forests ? Big trees ? Not where we live . It was open and warm , with good rock , and the blue sea . . . who 'd want to live back in the woods ? Nobody there but demons . You might walk for days and never see a living soul , just green leaves . Brrrr ! " <p> 10th day 5th week 4th month in the 231st year from the Ascent of the Mountain . This day , Slave 4372301 assigned to General Labor Pool , Class 3 . Requisitioned by Magister Tagletsit . <p> Magister Tagletsit regretted the loss of the sun . He had come from a far desert country , where the sun was worshiped as a harsh lord , unquestioned master , king of dunes and stones and serpents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shivering subjects might the better appreciate his return by morning . <p> So cruel a father must necessarily breed desperate love in his children . Magister Tagletsit , when he had found himself facing an eternity in stone- bound darkness , could not imagine life anywhere but under the blazing eye of his God . It nearly drove him to self- sacrifice ; but then he had devised a means by which his discomfort was eased . <p> He lived in a great circular chamber , partitioned into rooms , the whole strictly aligned with the unseen points of the compass . All around its outer wall ran a tunnel . The tunnel wall was pierced through with many little windows into the rooms , through which shone the light and heat , at any given moment , of five hundred oil lamps . <p> The tunnel contained five thousand lamps , ranged in brass along its length , from east to west . One slave 's duty was , each day , to consult the astronomical charts to determine at what precise spot on the horizon the unseen sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel in felt slippers and move a golden peg to the corresponding point marked off on the tunnel wall . <p> Then he would return to his bed , for he was a valued slave with advanced clerical skills . Gard , unskilled cripple , must turn an hourglass and begin the daylong task of lighting each bank of lamps , east to west , one after another , extinguishing the first when the last had been lit . Then he would turn the glass and repeat the process on the next bank of lamps , thus working his way around the tunnel . <p> Each day he labored so , naked in the tunnel , while the sweat ran from his body , while the muscles in his arms screamed for hatred of his weight , and hatred of his useless legs that dangled between the crutches . Unthinkable to stop ; for at each hour- mark a little cistern was mounted in the wall that would only discharge its drinking water for him if all the lamps to that point had been lit , and in the proper sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The leather of his tongue in his dry mouth kept him faithful . <p> And if he was tempted , still , to die and never sweat or thirst again , one thought kept him still faithful : that there really were green forests beyond the mountains , and if he lived to escape , he might go there one day , even as Ranwyr might have gone . He might find a pass through the mountains into the valley and lead a weary people to freedom , even as Ranwyr might have led them . <p> And Magister Tagletsit was happy within his rooms , watching the angled light change with the passage of hours , basking in the warmth , and was able to pray in praise , " How great thou art , O Sun , whose eye pierces even into the depths of the earth ! Truly thou art great , and none can hide from thee . " <p> " Not so bad , after all , is it ? " said Triphammer , when he would come in to tend to Gard 's legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a soft job , eh ? Just you think about what they rescued you from . Just you remember that ice , and those banks of snow . That 's what I do , when I get to feeling sorry for myself . There I was , lost in drifts over my head , and was n't I grateful to be let inside here ! " <p> Triphammer said the same thing always , reliable as the circling sun . <p> " Why were n't your legs frozen , like mine ? " Gard asked him , one night . <p> " Because I had a proper pair of boots on when I ran away , did n't I ? Was n't a naked jungle- boy like you , " said Triphammer , not unkindly . He took Gard 's foot and bent his leg at the knee . " Here , now : push with your foot , try to straighten out your leg . Hard as you can . Good ! Good boy ! " <p> A rumble of wheels came from the corridor outside , the tramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a voice mocked them , high and shrill . " Is n't he just the best little cripple that ever was ? " <p> A long- nosed , blind face came around the edge of the doorway , as though peering in . It was followed by the rest of the speaker , bulky body , big long arms , four small thick legs . It pulled a wagon that supported a pair of immense jars . <p> " Catering , " the shrill voice announced . " Where 's your bowl , cripple ? Where 's your pitcher ? Going to make me hunt for them ? " <p> " They 're right by the door , where they 're supposed to be ! " said Triphammer in annoyance . " If you 'd used your ugly nose instead of eavesdropping on people , you 'd have found them straightaway . " <p> " Ugly , is it ? " Big leathery hands groped , found Gard 's meal dish and water pitcher . " Think I 'll leave a big lump of something special in your bowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pitcher in one jar . He lifted it out and pretended to urinate in it . <p> " Just ignore him , " said Triphammer to Gard . <p> Gard leaned up on his elbow to stare a threat , but saw Catering 's empty eye- sockets . " Who put out your eyes , slave ? " <p> The blind face grimaced , the head swung to and fro on its long neck . <p> " I was made without any , " said Catering . He dipped Gard 's bowl into the other jar and withdrew it brimming with dinner , into which he pretended to spit . " Here 's your meal , cripple . May it poison you . " <p> He slammed the bowl and the pitcher down and trudged on down the corridor . " He talks like that to everyone , " said Triphammer . " All talk , though . Never you mind him . " <p> Gard wondered what would frighten a creature so immense that it took refuge in threatening like a nasty- minded child . <p> Sometimes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gard looked through the windows into Magister Tagletsit 's rooms . At any hour he might see plump Magister Tagletsit in placid contemplation of a roll of paper covered in tiny black markings , or reclining on a bed covered in rich woven stuff trimmed in gold , or pouring a bloodred drink for himself from a pitcher . The pitcher fascinated Gard . It seemed to be made of clear ice , cut and faceted in patterns , perilous beauty , and yet it never melted in the heat of the lamps . He wondered what it would feel like if he touched it . <p> One day , when Magister Tagletsit was away and the pitcher had been left on a table near a window , Gard reached through the window and touched it . He was surprised ; it was no cooler than anything else in the room . <p> He paid a price to learn that much . Hobbling back to his cell when lamp- night had fallen , he was overtaken by Triphammer , who was scowling . <p> " What 'd you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icicle ! Now we 've both got to go report to Hodrash . No , not that way ! Down this turning . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because you went and intruded , did n't you ? Stuck your big , dirty jungle- paw through the window and left handprints all over the poor magister 's nice pitcher ! " <p> " But no one saw me , " said Gard , astounded . <p> " You big fool , the magister 's spirits saw you ! These are mages . Did n't you know , they 've got spirits you ca n't see , watching over all that belongs to them ? But I suppose you did n't know , how could you know ? I do n't seem to have told you . The more blame to me . This way . Hurry ! Do n't make it worse for us . " <p> Triphammer led him along an unfamiliar corridor in the rock . They turned in at last through a doorway . The chamber beyond was high- ceilinged , and to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sat without crowding . No one sat there now but three of the masters , in their fine robes , with a fourth entering in some haste . He bowed to the others , took his seat , and turned , all expectant , to watch . <p> On the floor of the chamber crouched a demon , golden- skinned , whose arms were great with muscle . He was amusing himself with a piece of intricately carved wood , a puzzle whose interlinking sections could be shifted to form different pictures . He set it aside when Gard and Triphammer entered and rose to his feet with a sigh . " Malefactors , " he intoned in a bored kind of way . <p> " Reporting , " said Triphammer briskly . " We acknowledge our sins and submit ourselves for discipline . " <p> Gard , looking up , saw the masters lean forward in their seats . The demon went to the wall , where scourges of different sizes were hung , and looked over his shoulder at Triphammer . " Which of you is it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triphammer , divesting himself of his tunic and hanging it neatly on a hook provided for that purpose . " My fault really , I should have explained better . And it 's the boy 's first time , Hodrash . " <p> Hodrash nodded and selected a scourge . Triphammer went meanwhile to a post in the center of the floor . He stood on tiptoe to grasp hold of a bar at the top of the post . Gard watched , unbelieving , as Hodrash the house of the stag advanced and swung his big arm , and the scourge bit deep into Triphammer 's back . <p> Triphammer grunted and set his face against the post . Crack , crack , crack , in quick succession the blows fell , businesslike . Gard remembered crouching hidden at the edge of a field , watching as an overseer had beaten a poor failing slave . White anger in his heart , then , and the resolve to die before he might ever be taken as a slave . And now- <p> " Hai , " panted Triphammer , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oozed from the stripes on his back . " Over and done , thank all the gods . Come on then , icicle . Your turn . " <p> Icicle indeed ; Gard stood frozen in his tracks . Hodrash looked at him in contempt , but there was pity in his face too , and he came to Gard saying loudly , " Not easy to move on those sticks , is it ? Come along , boy . " He hissed into Gard 's ear , " Do n't shame old Triphammer . If he endured , you should , a big lout like you . " <p> So Gard let himself be led to the post , as though it were a nightmare and he had no power to resist , and let Hodrash help him to the bar , and Triphammer collected his crutches when they fell clattering to the floor . " You did n't have to bellow like that , " said Triphammer aggrievedly , as he washed Gard 's back . " Though I suppose if it was your first time , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more self- respect next time , I hope . " <p> " I will never be beaten for their amusement again , " said Gard . <p> " That 's the spirit ! Resolve to be a better boy . " <p> Gard opened one eye to look over his shoulder at Triphammer . He wanted to strike him ; but Triphammer 's own back was still bleeding , untended , and the same pain must still be throbbing in his skin . <p> " I never thought you 'd do a stupid thing like that , else I 'd have warned you , " Triphammer went on , rubbing salve into Gard 's cuts . It burned , though not so badly as the scourge . " But I did tell you they were mages , did n't I ? " <p> " I did n't think they had any real power , " said Gard . <p> " Ah ! Thought they were street conjurors , did you ? The kind who pull colored scarves out of their fists ? No , no , boy . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Gard slowly . " Everyone said he was so wonderful , so wise , that he was going to save us all . And he did n't . Things only got worse . " <p> " Very likely , with your jungle shamans . But there is such a thing as real Power , you see ? And the masters have it . You wo n't forget that now , I daresay . " <p> " Never again , " said Gard . <p> When Gard 's back had healed , Triphammer took him down to his new job . <p> " It 's not so bad , the Pumping Station , " Triphammer said , as they approached a cavern mouth that glowed red with firelight . " You 'll have lots of company , at least . You 'll be off your feet too . And I 'd find it a more satisfying kind of work if I were you , because after all , it 's more important , is n't it ? Keeping the air and water moving and all . If it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirst . So that 's some compensation , eh ? And it could be worse . You could have drawn cesspit duty . " <p> Triphammer rambled on at greater length about how fortunate Gard was , but his voice was drowned out as they entered the cavern . The cavern echoed with noise . <p> In the center of it a great fire roared ; in the roof of it great turning blades of fans were mounted , to send warmed air into the hypocaust . The fans were connected by a series of gears of increasing size to a long mechanism set in the floor , a row of a dozen handles at which eleven figures labored , cranking them , and the laborers sang as they worked , a deep plaintive repetitive chant . <p> Another bank of gears was at the far side of the cavern , with a dozen slaves laboring there , hard by where a black river emerged from rock and hurried to vanish over a precipice into darkness , from which mist rose . These gears lifted water to a turning screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire was fed by two demons who went back and forth with armfuls of some red stone , a mountain of which was piled at the back of the cavern . <p> The demons turned and stared as Gard entered with Triphammer . <p> " It 's the free boy , " yelled Grattur . <p> " It 's the little brother , " yelled Engrattur . They dropped the stones they had been carrying and advanced on Gard , grinning . <p> " You see ? " shouted Triphammer . " You 've friends here already . Wo n't that be nice ? Mind you do n't learn stupid habits from them , though . They had a nice secure job carrying litters for Magister Hoptriot , and what did they go and do ? " <p> " Stole his elixirs to make ourselves drunk ! " said Grattur proudly . <p> " Stole his powders to get ourselves stoned ! " said Engrattur . <p> " What 's he doing here ? Not gear duty ? " <p> " Not gear duty , a fine boy like this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Triphammer , gesturing at Gard 's crutches . <p> " Ah . But we 'd heard he 'd pulled duty on the Big Lantern . " <p> " So he did ! A nice secure job , and he went and lost it by breaking the rules , " said Triphammer . The brothers howled with laughter . <p> " Broke the rules ! " <p> " Broke the rules ! Ah , he 's one of us ! " <p> " Do n't encourage him , you fools , " said Triphammer , looking about nervously . <p> " We say what we like down here , hothead , " said Grattur . <p> " As long as the gears keep turning , they do n't care what we say , " said Engrattur . <p> " Yes . Well . Maybe so , and maybe not , " said Triphammer . He turned to Gard . " I 'm off to see to my other patients . Got a poor fellow lost his arm to the Blood Entertainments . No end of work retraining . You take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful , come the end of your shift , for a good exercise session with your legs . " <p> Triphammer left the cavern . The brothers pointed to the empty seat in the nearer bank of gears . " That 's your place . " <p> " Welcome to the Pumping Station ! " <p> Gard hobbled to the gear bank and took his seat under the massed glare of the other workers . Their song had fallen off-not to say fallen silent , in the unceasing commotion of that place . <p> " Who 's this big prick ? " demanded the nearest . Gard scowled at him , then started as he saw the speaker had no legs . His body ended at the hips , in a smooth asexual curve . Looking along the line , Gard could see that most of the others had suffered the same fate . <p> " What happened to your legs ? " blurted Gard . <p> " I was made without any , " said the other . He jerked his head in the direction of his fellow workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this job . They cheated us . " <p> " Only half- bodied them , " said Grattur , leaning down . " But they 're just as trapped as we are . That 's the masters for you , eh ? " <p> " Lure a poor creature in with promises of fun , and then leave off the most important bits , " said Engrattur . <p> " Grab your damned handle and help us , " said the worker . Gard obeyed . Raggedly , from the other end of the line , the song began again . <p> Excerpted from The House of the Stag by Kage Baker Copyright 2008 by Kage Baker Published in September 2008 by Tom Doherty
