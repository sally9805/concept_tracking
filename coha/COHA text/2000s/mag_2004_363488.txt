The rusting Hulks of Bethlehem Steel 's blast furnaces and coke ovens cast a long shadow over the Lehigh Valley . " Bessie " once employed 30,000 people in its namesake town in northeastern Pennsylvania . The company survives elsewhere , but what 's left of it here has been all but abandoned . The windows of the redbrick warehouses are cracked and clouded . A portion of train trestle stands idle , neither end connected to anything . Such sights would have been unimaginable 30 years ago , when the valley roared with the fires of open-hearth furnaces . <P> Does this empty shell represent the future of American manufacturing ? With cheap labor in China and other developing nations producing quality products at rock-bottom prices , can America still compete ? Or are we now an office nation , completely removed from the industries that built the modern U.S. economy ? <P> Take a tour of the valley  --  the very one Bethlehem Steel once symbolized  --  and you 'll find that American manufacturing has n't disappeared ; it is reinventing itself . As Bessie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new breed of manufacturing company has quietly emerged in the Lehigh Valley and in cities across the U.S. , even amid one of the worst manufacturing purges in recent memory . More than 2 million of the 2.5 million jobs lost over the past two years were in the manufacturing sector , and many are gone forever . But the U.S. economy is going through a major shift , one that is forcing this sector to adapt . It is a transformation similar to what agriculture experienced a generation earlier . The key : fewer people are responsible for the same or greater output . <P> Just what can the U.S. make ? Plenty , it turns out . But America 's future as a manufacturing power will look very different from its past . Thomas Duesterberg , president of the Manufacturers Alliance , an industry research group based in Washington , has a vision for the new U.S. factory . Unlike the mammoth facilities of the past that focused on large production runs , the factory that Duesterberg 's group has in mind is one that makes customized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . " We contrast that with the old , comic-book picture of manufacturing , which is making one piece of equipment a million times , " he says . <P> The transition is already happening . The manufacturers that are succeeding are n't the type that build company towns ; they are too busy churning out innovative products . They are n't the ones blaming their troubles on unions ; they 're working with them to make their plants run better . And they are n't clamoring for protection from cheap imports ; they 're competing furiously against them . They may never rise to the stature of yesterday 's industrial giants , but they are redefining what it means to be Made in America . <P> John Jones , CEO of Air Products &; Chemicals , remembers what it was like to be a young engineering graduate in the 1970s , when Bethlehem Steel was king of the valley . " When I was getting out of school , that was one of the places to go , " he says . " When people asked me where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , the usual response was pity . " They would go , ' Awww . ' " Today Air Products , with 4,300 workers , has replaced Bessie as the valley 's largest industrial employer .
