What Do Animals Need ? // what does an animal need to have a good life ? // I do n't mean a good life physically . We know a lot about what kind of food , water , exercise , and veterinary care animals need to grow well and be healthy . // I mean a good mental life . // What does an animal need to be happy ? // The animal welfare movement has been thinking about animals ' mental welfare at least since the 1960s . That 's when the British government commissioned the Brambell Report on intensive animal production . Intensive animal production means very big farms raising large numbers of animals for slaughter or egg production in very small spaces compared to traditional farms . The Brambell committee listed the five freedoms animals should have . The first three freedoms are about physical welfare , and the last two are about mental welfare : // freedom from hunger and thirst // freedom from discomfort // freedom from pain , injury , or disease // freedom to express normal behavior // freedom from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people trying to give animals a good life . Even freedom from fear , which sounds straightforward , is n't simple or obvious . For example , zookeepers and farmers usually assume that as long as a prey species animal does n't have any predators around , it ca n't be afraid . But that 's not the way fear works inside the brain . If you felt fear only when you are face-to-face with the animal that 's going to kill you and eat you , that would be too late . Prey species animals feel afraid when they 're out in the open and exposed to potential predators . For example , a hen has to have a place to hide when she lays her eggs . It does n't matter that she 's laying her eggs on a commercial farm inside a barn that no fox will ever get into . The hen has evolved to hide when she lays her eggs . Hiding is what gives her freedom from fear , not living in a barn that keeps the foxes out . I 'll talk more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express normal behavior is even more complicated and hard to apply in the real world . In many cases , it 's impossible to give a domestic or captive animal the freedom to express a normal behavior . For a dog , normal behavior is to roam many miles a day , which is illegal in most towns . Even if it 's not illegal , it 's dangerous . So you have to figure out substitute behaviors that keep your dog happy and stimulated . // In other cases , we do n't know how to create the right living conditions because we do n't know enough about what the normal behavior of a particular animal is . Cheetahs are a good example . Zookeepers tried to breed cheetahs for years with almost no success . That 's a common problem in zoos . Breeding is one of the most basic and normal behaviors there is . There would n't be any animals or people without it . But a lot of animals living in captivity do n't mate successfully because there 's something wrong with their living conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finally solved in 1994 , when a study of cheetahs on the Serengeti Plains came out and everyone realized male and female cheetahs did n't live together in the wild the way they did in zoos . When zoos separated the female cheetahs from the males , they turned out to be easy to breed in captivity . // Animal distress is even more mysterious . What is distress in an animal ? Is it anger ? Is it loneliness ? Is it boredom ? Is boredom a feeling ? And how can you tell if an animal is lonely or bored ? // Although a lot of good work has been done on mental welfare for animals , it 's hard for pet owners , farmers , ranchers , and zookeepers to use it because they do n't have clear guidelines . Right now , when a zoo wants to improve welfare , what usually happens is that the staff tries everything they can think of that they have the money and the personnel to implement . Mostly they focus on the animal 's behavior and try to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the best way to create good living conditions for any animal , whether it 's a captive animal living in a zoo , a farm animal , or a pet , is to base animal welfare programs on the core emotion systems in the brain . My theory is that the environment animals live in should activate their positive emotions as much as possible , and not activate their negative emotions any more than necessary . If we get the animal 's emotions right , we will have fewer problem behaviors. // That might sound like a radical statement , but some of the research in neuroscience has been showing that emotions drive behavior , and my own thirty-five years of experience working with animals have shown me that this is true . Emotions come first . You have to go back to the brain to understand animal welfare . // Of course , usually - though not always - the more freedom you give an animal to act naturally , the better , because normal behaviors evolved to satisfy the core emotions . When a hen hides to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you ca n't give an animal the freedom to act naturally , then you should think about how to satisfy the emotion that motivates the behavior by giving the animal other things to do . Focus on the emotion , not the behavior. // So far , research in animal behavior agrees with the neuroscience research on emotions . A really good study on whether animals have purely behavioral needs was done with gerbils . Gerbils love to dig and tunnel , and a lot of them develop a corner-digging stereotypy when they 're around thirty days old . A stereotypy is an abnormal repetitive behavior ( ARB for short ) , such as a lion or tiger pacing back and forth in its cage for hours on end . Pets and farm animals can develop stereotypies , too . Stereotypies are defined as abnormal behaviors that are repetitive , invariant ( lions always pace the exact same path in their cages ) , and seemingly pointless . // An adult gerbil spends up to 30 percent of its " active time " doing stereotypic digging in the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many researchers have hypothesized that the reason captive gerbils develop stereotypic digging is that they have a biological need to dig that they ca n't express inside a cage . // On the other hand , in nature gerbils do n't dig just to be digging . They dig to create underground tunnels and nests . Once they 've hollowed out their underground home , they stop digging . Maybe what the gerbil needs is the result of the digging , not the behavior itself . A Swiss psychologist named Christoph Wiedenmayer set up an experiment to find out . He put one set of baby gerbils in a cage with dry sand they could dig in , and another set in a cage with a predug burrow system but nothing soft to dig in . The gerbils in the sand-filled box developed digging stereotypies right away , whereas none of the gerbils in the cage with the burrows did . // That shows that the motivation for a gerbil 's digging stereotypy is a need to hide inside a sheltered space , not a need to dig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action of digging . Animals do n't have purely behavioral needs , and if an animal expresses a normal behavior in an abnormal environment , its welfare may be poor . A gerbil that spends 30 percent of its time digging without being able to make a tunnel does not have good welfare . // The Blue-Ribbon Emotions // All animals and people have the same core emotion systems in the brain . Most pet owners probably already believe this , but I find that a lot of executives , plant managers , and even some veterinarians and researchers still do n't believe that animals have emotions . The first thing I tell them is that the same psychiatric medications , such as Prozac , that work for humans also work for animals . Unless you are an expert , when you dissect a pig 's brain it 's difficult to tell the difference between the lower-down parts of the animal 's brain and the lower-down parts of a human brain . Human beings have a much bigger neocortex , but the core emotions are n't located in the neocortex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // When people are suffering mentally , they want to feel better - they want to stop having bad emotions and start having good emotions . That 's the right goal with animals , too . // Dr. Jaak Panksepp , a neuroscientist at Washington State University who wrote the book Affective Neuroscience and is one of the most important researchers in the field , calls the core emotion systems the " blue-ribbon emotions , " because they " generate well-organized behavior sequences that can be evoked by localized electrical stimulation of the brain . " This means that when you stimulate the brain systems for one of the core emotions , you always get the same behaviors from the animal . If you stimulate the anger system , the animal snarls and bites . If you stimulate the fear system , the animal freezes or runs away . Electrodes in the social attachment system cause the animal to make separation calls , and electrodes in the " SEEKING " system make the animal start moving forward , sniffing , and exploring its environment . When you stimulate these parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bite , but they report the same emotions animals show . // People and animals ( and possibly birds ) are born with these emotions - they do n't learn them from their mothers or from the environment - and neuroscientists know a fair amount about how they work inside the brain . // Here is a quick rundown of the four blue-ribbon emotion systems , which Jaak always writes in all caps : // SEEKING : Dr. Panksepp says SEEKING is " the basic impulse to search , investigate , and make sense of the environment . " SEEKING is a combination of emotions people usually think of as being different : wanting something really good , looking forward to getting something really good , and curiosity , which most people probably do n't think of as being an emotion at all . // The wanting part of SEEKING gives you the energy to go after your goals , which can be anything from food , shelter , and sex to knowledge , a new car , or fame and fortune . When a cat stalks a mouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The looking-forward-to part of SEEKING is the Christmas emotion . When kids see all the presents under the Christmas tree , their SEEKING system goes into overdrive . // Curiosity is related to novelty . I think the orienting response is the first stage of SEEKING because it is attracted to novelty . When a deer or a dog hears a strange noise , he turns his head , looks , and pauses . During the pause , the animal decides , Do I keep SEEKING , run away in fear , or attack ? New things stimulate the curiosity part of the SEEKING system . Even when people are curious about something familiar - like behaviorists being curious about animals , for instance - they can only be curious about some aspect they do n't understand . They are SEEKING an explanation that they do n't have yet . SEEKING is always about something you do n't have yet , whether it 's food and shelter or Christmas presents or a way to understand animal welfare . // SEEKING is a very pleasurable emotion . If you implant electrodes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will press a lever to turn the current on . Animals like to self-stimulate the SEEKING system so much that for a long time researchers thought the SEEKING system was the brain 's " pleasure center , " and some people still talk about it that way . But the pleasure people feel when their SEEKING system is stimulated is the pleasure of looking forward to something good , not the pleasure of having something good . // SEEKING might be a kind of master emotion . Jaak Panksepp says that seeking could be a " generalized platform for the expression of many of the basic emotional processes ... It is the one system that helps animals anticipate all types of rewards . " It 's possible the SEEKING system helps you anticipate bad things , too . There is new research showing that one area in the nucleus acumbens , which is part of the SEEKING system , responds to negative stimuli the animal is afraid of . The SEEKING system might turn out to be an all-purpose emotion engine that produces both positive and negative motivations to approach or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means the positive emotions of wanting , looking forward to , or being curious about something , and that 's the way I will be using the term in this book . SEEKING feels good . // RAGE : Dr. Panksepp believes that the core emotion of RAGE evolved from the experience of being captured and held immobile by a predator . Stimulation of subcortical brain areas causes an animal to go into a rage . RAGE gives a captured animal the explosive energy it needs to struggle violently and maybe shock the predator into loosening its grip long enough that the captured animal can get away . The RAGE feeling starts at birth - if you hold a human baby 's arms to his sides , he will become furiously angry . // Frustration is a mild form of RAGE that is sparked by mental restraint when you ca n't do something you 're trying to do . That 's why you feel mild anger when you ca n't unscrew a tight lid from a jar or when you ca n't solve a math problem . In one case the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other the mental action of solving the math problem has been restrained . Frustration from mental restraint evolved out of RAGE from physical restraint . // We should assume that some captive animals feel frustrated being locked up inside enclosures , barns , apartments and houses , yards , and cages , because being locked up is a form of restraint no matter how nice the environment is . Many captive animals try to escape as soon as they have an opportunity . That was something my dissertation adviser at the University of Illinois , Bill Greenough , used to talk about . Bill used to say that maybe when we created enriched environments for laboratory animals we were just creating an enlightened San Quentin prison . I think he was right . // FEAR : The FEAR system does n't need a lot of explanation . Animals and humans feel FEAR when their survival is threatened in any way , from the physical to the mental and social . The FEAR circuits in the subcortex of the brain have been fully mapped . Destruction of the amygdala , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The core emotion of FEAR motivated the gerbils I mentioned before to dig , because in the wild gerbils who did not dig tunnels were eaten by predators . // PANIC : PANIC is Jaak 's word for the social attachment system . All baby animals and humans cry when their mothers leave , and an isolated baby whose mother does not come back is likely to become depressed and die . The PANIC system probably evolved from physical pain . When you stimulate the part of an animal 's brain that regulates physical pain , the animal makes separation cries . Opioids are even more effective at treating social pain than they are at treating physical pain . Jaak says that 's probably why people say it " hurts " to lose someone they love . // Dr. Panksepp also writes about three other positive emotion systems researchers do n't know as much about , and that do n't necessarily run through an animal 's entire life . He calls these three emotions " more sophisticated special- purpose socioemotional systems that are engaged at appropriate times in the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sexual desire . // CARE : CARE is Dr. Panksepp 's term for maternal love and caretaking . // PLAY : PLAY is the brain system that produces the kind of roughhousing play all young animals and humans do at the same stage in their development . The parts of the brain that motivate PLAY are in the subcortex . No one understands the nature of playing or the PLAY system in the brain well yet , although we do know that play behavior is probably a sign of good welfare , because an animal that 's depressed , frightened , or angry does n't play . The PLAY system produces feelings of joy . // Taken together , these seven emotions - especially the first four - explain why some environments are good for animals ( and people ) and others are bad . In a good environment you have healthy brain development and few behavior issues . // ( Continues ... ) //
