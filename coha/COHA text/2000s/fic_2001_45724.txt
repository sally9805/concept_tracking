Sometimes by design , but usually by chance , issues of F &SF; seem to wind up with themes linking the stories in most issues . This month 's offerings have turned out to be more intellectual than usual-hey , the issue comes complete with footnotes . Ms. Emshwiller 's new story fits in with this cerebral theme . It also cuts right to the important questions of life : Who are we ! Why are we here ? What sort of head gear should we wear ? <p> FOR GENERATIONS OUR wives have said , " What ? What ! Why are you men always adoing and adoing , such that you are hither and thither all the time while we harvest and chop , set the traps , make the ropes for the bridges and the ropes for the bridges and the ropes for the slings and nets - we even make the ropes for the Project ? " I always answer , " Men are adoing . " This is the second project . The first failed . The remnants of it lie in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grandfathers failed because they did n't know as much as we know now , but I think they had tricks and theories . Easy to see they were as smart as we are . I 've seen their shattered boulders . Some are even larger than our largest , or were before they fell . We no longer attempt to raise boulders of that size . This has been a part of our lives for as long as even our oldest can remember . We ca n't think back to when the Project was not our main concern . Nor conceive of such a time . And why would we want to ? Those days must have been useless days . We are a strong people . You can see it in our noses . None but the strong could have stayed and lived here . Our hair is bleached by altitude . Our legs are stringy . Even our old ladies still jump from stone to stone . Our songs , unlike those of any other peoples , are full of hohs . Some say we do n't sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we built a fortress . This was so long ago we no longer understand its purpose . ( We live within its crumbling walls . ) Except for the mountain lion we have no enemies . And who but us would want land such as this with hardly a single flat spot larger than a split boulder ? That lion took our baby daughter . That 's why my wife keeps saying , " What ? What ! " She blames me . " Had you been ... ! Had you but been ... ! Had you ! " I say , and I say it slowly , " As . It . Is . We 've hardly enough men for the Project . " There are but eighty . We need every single one on the ropes . The stone we raise now is the largest so far . Could n't be done , they said and said , but we are doing it . The evening our baby was taken , the owl flew low , looking huge in the moonlight . I thought I could reach up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wings . First I thought it was a ghost . Then I thought , It 's just an owl , not knowing that it really was a ghost , or soon would be . As to the lion , my baby daughter must have made but a single mouthful . I 'm not the only one who has lost a child . This happens when game is scarce . It had been a dry winter . The pine nuts were few , so rodents are few . Grouse , hares , the sweet , gray foxes , few . Our wild mountain sheep , eaten to the last of them . We have to depend on our goats for everything now . ( Would that my daughter had been penned up with the kids . ) ( The blanket my wife was knitting is now for someone else 's child . ) Since we lost our little girl my wife has been blaming me even for the lack of radishes . " Not even trim the wicks , " she says . " It 's little enough , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do I sit ? Tired as I am , do I sit ? " I say , " Tired as I am . Look how my eyes are shutting . " I say , " Until you work at raising boulders , you will never understand such a tiredness as this . " Radishes ! Wicks ! Who would care but somebody 's wife ? They said the stones are too big , the mountain top too high , lightning will strike , boulders will turn red , glow , and then crack as if to deafen . I say , " Yes , yes ! Of course ! " Say what they wish , but it 's easy to see all paths lead to our village . One has only to climb to our highest places and look down to see how true that is . We 're not a way station alongside some path that goes someplace else . Therefore it 's clear there is no need to go to some lower place and look for other happenings , so we have never gone . Our catamount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her eyes shine . Disembodied . Steady on . Then a sudden freezing along the backbone , as if I saw a child on the brink of the brink . The lion is young . We think she 's only recently left the den of her birth . She 's thin . It 's the young ones , do n't yet know what they 're about , so all the more dangerous . She 's the color of our boulders . She belongs  --  as much as we do . In fact more . I 'm a strong man . A big man . The biggest . Except for me we do n't look like the people of the valley . We 're smaller and wirier . I have never been down there , but now and then one of them climbs up here . We recognize them right away and not just because we know everybody who lives up here , but by their cheekbones and their wide open eyes . We know they 're used to shadows because when we look down there , into their valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . We wonder what they 're up to here in the up instead of down in their the down . Down there they call us , " The people of the goats , or of the mountain sheep . " They even call us , " The people of the catamount . " We are more likely the people of the dinner of the catamount . My wife says , " Should n't the Project be the lion ? Should n't the lion be first so our little ones can sleep in peace or play capture the peak ? If you 'll not make the lion your project , then I 'll make it mine . " How can she ? She ca n't even draw the bow . And as to the spear .... Women use spears as canes to steady themselves as they climb over rocks . ( One evening I saw our house cat leap up and pull a bat out of the air . I know what my wife will have to deal with . ) " If you do n't go , I go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting ? For the cabbages to grow ? " Is she really going out to hunt lion , small as she is and always cold without me to warm her ? " Go , " I say , " I 'm busy with the Project . There will always be a beast , if not this one then another . " Yet I will follow . Even though I 'm not only the foreman , but the most important puller and checker and the finest fitter of all , and my voice echoes out over the canyons louder than any , I will follow . My pockmarked face has made her my one and only . Even my size was against me with the women . We men of the mountains are not like me . I 'm teased that my father was not my father but that my mother was raped by some valley man and never confessed it . " Out picking berries , one can not only come across a bear . " Though they also say my father was a bear - a bald-headed bear . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. even she would hardly be a mouthful for the lion . She 's as small as I am large . Her name is Wren and she 's like a wren . Our women are named Lark , Titmouse , Towhee , Quail , Redstart , Killdeer .... ( Killdeer because we so admire the broken wing trick and hope to see the same in the mothers of our children . ) Our men are named for raptors : Vulture , Eagle , Hawk , Goshawk , Kestrel , Falcon , and such . ( Not Owl . We would never name anyone Owl . ) My name is Harrier . We named our baby Sparrow . Now I can hardly think that word . I say , " It 's the lion that will be stalking you . " " I will be adoing . " Always .... Always the women take our time from what 's important . The Project will last for generations . Centuries . Perhaps forever . Even as long as our mountain remains a mountain . Women 's thoughts are on the everyday . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you ever thought of that ? " And I would say it except I already have and more times than I can count . What I think as I follow my woman down and then up , and then up and down and down and up again , is : How fortunate to be alive so far ! The turkey vulture soars . One tiny cloud . For a while a raven family keeps one step ahead . I 'm thinking how the Milky Way is still up there shining all across the sky , there , even though you ca n't see it in the daytime . I 'm needed elsewhere , but I will enjoy the day as it is right now , though my wife , my wren , hurries away from me with all my weapons . Whenever I top a rise and look back I see them struggling . My group at the top - all the strongest pullers . I see skids and ramps and wedges , pulleys .... They wo n't make much headway without me . ( I did n't ask leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife out here in The Nowhere , much less in The Down ? ) Did Wren look back and see I was n't there ? I would have been easy to spot because of my bulk . Now , as I look I can see that all are , just as they are , mountain men and small . No wonder they joke that I 'm the bastard of a bald-headed bear . She 's easy to follow . We wear red , the mountain color . The better to be seen . She wears a red bonnet and her fuzzy red sweater . She has her boots and her mittens tied on the back of her pack . She wears moccasins , but crosses the streams barefoot and wipes her feet with a red towel . But I wear the color of the lion and stay well behind . The black straps of my pack across my chest , my wide black hat , imitate the cracks of the mountains and make me even more like a piece of half-split rock . She goes lower , then climbs up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side and tawny , more rounded granite on the other . Behind the black side , an iron oxide peak looms orange . There 's several patches of frazzle ice to chew on . There are overhanging rocks . I 'm thinking this is a good place for a lioness . Then I know this is the place . I do n't know how I know but I can almost smell her . Here is where my wife , my lion 's mouthful , decides to spend the night . I guess if the lion finds it inviting , everyone would . She does n't look frightened as she settles in . I suppose one who has just lost a baby does n't feel any fear for a long time afterward . Perhaps never . I stay close . Then I come closer . I watch my wife sleep in the moonlight . All the nights since the baby died she has n't slept much but now she does . As if the very danger is comforting . As if what has eaten our baby might eat her so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons , dress myself in a leather apron . Surely the lion will come . Surely the lion is here already . I see her - first just eyes reflecting moonlight , then a shadow . She comes out from a low overhang , exactly where I thought she 'd come from . I 'd never have seen her if I had n't suspected she 'd come from there . She stands still and looks at me . Even though I knew ... even though I hoped she 'd be there , I feel that edge-of-a-cliff feeling , myself , about to fall . Or the Project about to come loose and crash down on us . I want to lure her away from my wife , so , like the killdeer , I limp . Down from the cozy pass , down into the switchbacks below , behind boulders , away and lower . I do n't want even the sounds .. neither my sounds nor cat sounds .... But if we 're this far down , why would my wife think they had anything to do with me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's midnight yowls , howls , screeches , caterwauling , up there near our village , and turned to each other , and said , " It 's only the young lion , fresh out of her mother 's den . " Why would my wife think anything of it except to reach for me and find me not there ? When we 're far down , lioness and I , and in a flat clear place where trees are few and the moon shines through and I can see clearly , I turn . It 's this leather apron between me and claws that saves me . And , of course , the inexperience of the lioness . She had a look in her eyes of wondering about the world . My daughter had the same . And when I killed her she had a look as if to say : I ca n't be , and already , dead . No doubt my daughter had the same when that moment came to her . When I saw that , I hesitated , but it was too late . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No doubt about it , she was starving . No doubt about it , she 'd have come after my wife . Perhaps my wife wanted her to . Warmth to warmth , fur to skin , as lovers . Or herself as gift . Or simply to close a circle . I limp back - this time the limping is real . I expected worse . I brought herbs and bandages in case . Back under the lioness 's overhang , I bandage myself . I stow my weapons and the leather apron in a comer . Then I go lie down , again not far from my wife to guard her . As I had told her , there will always be a beast somewhere out there at the edges of our lives . Pain keeps me from sleeping . One ca n't get close to any sort of cat without having wounds . I had thought my wife would turn around and go back , but she goes on . She does n't know the lion is dead . Should I stop her ? Try to ? Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midday ? Show myself ? But one look at me and she 'd know all there is to know . I 'll not yet show myself . I chafe with all this hithering and thithering . I regret every minute I spend away from the Project . We say , " What 's worth the doing is worth dying for or why be adoing . " I might well have died here in the middle of nowhere . I had always thought to die for the Project , not from cat scratchings . My wife goes on down , not knowing she 's stalking nothing . Might as well be following her own stepped-on mosses . Might as well look up and back and over her left shoulder for the special place where dead babies congregate for each other 's company - all the dead babies who have just smiled their first smiles . None of us know anything about The Down , and proud of it . There 'll be bear . There 'll be snakes and bugs and goodness knows what . Things we never heard of . Trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . From here I get a good view of this flat land . Flat as far as you can see . We know nothing about it nor care to . We do n't ponder fields , or horses or cows or plows . We say , " That which is highest is its own reward . " Those big ugly men , hunking around down there . Altitude makes them puff . Their lips turn blue . We offer them our best food knowing they 'll refuse . Always halfway along that last and steepest climb to our fortress , they throw up . If they ca n't see the importance of the Project then there 's no explaining it , neither to them nor to our women who keep saying , " What in the world ! " and , " Why ! Why ever ! " I told her and I told her , you ca n't stalk a cat . Where does she think she 's on the way to ? Does she want to see for herself all that we are proud not knowing ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply wants to find something different ? And she already has . I never saw flowers as large as these . I see her peer and sniff . I see her stroke the velvet of the petals . She leans as she leaned over our baby . I do . I do love her . I climb a mound and look back ( mound is all one can call these lumps of The Down . These silly hills make me even more proud to be a mountain man . ) I ca n't see my men anymore , nor pulleys nor ropes , but the Project is clear , bright white against the sky . Exactly as we planned it . When we cap it with that last and largest boulder , we 'll have done the impossible . My wife stands and looks and listens . She imitates the call of a bird I never heard before . ( She can imitate all the bird calls in the mountains , but this is a new sound to us . ) I see she 's here for whatever she can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She studies the ground and then steps carefully so as not to crush anything , even something small . I 'm beginning to feel as she must be feeling , that this is to be seen and known about . I look around as she looks around . The sky is flatter than I thought . Distances are different . I 'll have to walk it to understand it . And there the horned cows . Without them I 'd not have had a leather apron tough enough to save me . But this is our water . It all comes from us . As we climbed down , always we heard rushing water sounds and thought nothing of it because , up in our village , it is the sound of our daily life . Here they 've forced it into straight lines all across their land . Until now , I had wondered what those straight lines were . Nothing is as straight up there except split rocks . When the sun shined all the way down here , I had thought the waterways were of silver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife has hurried on as though to reach some new thing before some other new thing , but it 'll be dark soon . She will have to find a bedding down place even here in this pasture land . Once away from the mounds , there 's not a single boulder . None have rolled this far . But now and then there are trees and sometimes bushes , especially along the ditches that tame our water . My wife finds a place to hide . She has already taken off all her red , back in the lower hills . What will they be thinking of her here , where everything is large ? And what will they think of her trousers and her fine bleached hair ? I , being the size I am , could hide as one of them , whereas she could never . Except I would n't know how to live here . What do you say to a horse ? What do you whistle to send a dog off and around ? And what of bulls ? I 've heard things of bulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes at a faster walk . In The Up our steps are slower because the ground is rough . But even these people of The Down ca n't walk away from time . Before she goes to hide in her bushes she studies the moon . I see that she sees as I do - how life depends on water and on sky . She gestures , one palm up . She seems to make a wish . We say to children , catch a moon beam , make a wish , but you need a pinch of mountain aster for it to come true . I lie down , next bush to her . This time I do sleep . Though I wonder , what of bulls ? And what of dogs and how large do they grow down here ? This time , when I finally wake , she 's stepping away from the shelter of the trees . She 's in red again , showing herself on purpose . Nearby , at the edge of the field , there 's what I know is a plow . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so stiff and sore I can hardly get up but I do . Here , already , there 's a flatland man coming straight toward her . The man is riding sideways on one of those horse things . I had not known there 'd be so much hair at the ankles . All kinds of straps hang down . So many one wonders how he knows to hook them up . He jumps off and leads the horse to the plow and to my wife . They stand one to one . They speak . He , with the swallowed Rs of the Down and no clicks on the Ks . He calls her , Little Lady . " Little Lady of the mountains . " He reaches out his fingers . Is it as if to be smelled ? Does he think she 's an animal ? I can see he looks like me . Except no pock marks . ( I could never grow a decent beard because of that . His is decent . ) For a moment I see myself as if a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said so to my face . There came a time , though , when I won every fistfight . Then they hated me even more , but that all changed when I was old enough to work on the Project . I was foreman at seventeen . This man would scare every mountain man but me . He 's even larger than I am , but my muscles are the muscles of those who lift boulders . He and my wife reach out slowly . Touch hands as if the other is a miracle of strangeness . Then he reaches as if to touch her bleached hair . Reaches but does n't touch , though almost . Her hair has hardly any color , not enough to call it yellow . Something is happening between them . Something instant of the instant . " I want to see , " my wife says , " all the things of here . " I will show myself . I will risk as Wren does , whatever it is they do to people from Up , but mostly risk so my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've saved her . I look at myself ... my bandages leaking , my shredded sleeves and trousers , shredded everywhere where the apron did n't cover . My limp is not a pretense . My legs wobble . If I fall it wo n't be on purpose . Will either of them notice ? Does she understand what we add up to , I and my sweet Wren ? That I 've saved her and all the village and the children can play capture the peak ? For now until some other beast comes around . I will speak . I will say , As to the two of us . As to us .... And I do speak , but what I say is , " As to myself and the Project and the meaning of it .... " For a moment it 's as if the Project is before me , just as it has been every day and all the days of my life until now , shining , polished white against our sky , which is of a darker blue than this pale blue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think to say more of the things that are important , but I start to shake . I go down on my knees . They turn to me . I see my wife seeing what I wanted her to see . She says , " Oh ! " But he says , " You ! " and again , " You ! " It 's he who comes to me , lifts me and hugs me as if a brother found at last , kisses each cheek before I have time to think to pull away . I have n't the strength to anyway . This is not the mountain people 's way . The horse leans and noses me . I do n't know if he 'll bite or not . His head is much bigger than I thought a horse 's head would be and bonier . Though I 'm almost as big as this man , he lifts me over his shoulder and then pushes me up upon the creature . Sits me sideways . ( The creature is warm as a wife . Warm as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The man walks us toward the village . The movement of the horse is painful to my scratches . I gasp , but my wife is looking up at this man , not at me . She walks beside him as though it was the most natural thing in the world to be crossing this flat land with grass all over it , with a stranger , and with me on a horse . Other men , sideways on their horses are coming out , one by one and two by two , to their fields . As we meet the first , the man says , " Here 's our long lost bastard half brother . We 've waited all this time for him to come back to us . And does n't he look just like his father ? " I want to say , A bear ! A bear was my father , but I 'm too tired and sick to protest . I think my wife should do it for me considering the state I 'm in . I want her to say how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , you would see it in my walk ; and if I spoke , you would hear it in my words , but I fear she may no longer be proud of our mountains , though she knows full well the mountains are where everything begins , where even this very water , here in this very roadside ditch , rolls down from , even where the weather is engendered , else why would clouds hang at their tops ? How can it be that one look in one single moment to one man almost as ugly as I am , is enough to change her mind ? I must protest . I do n't know how much these people know of important things . Perhaps there 's no such thing as marriage as we know it up there . We always say they 're in need of speeches down here , so I begin , even just to these two men and these two horses who swivel their ears toward me , listening . I had not thought to mention the Project , but I do . I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the reasons for it ? How figure elevations so as to know the highest and therefore most important of all the mountains ? " But my wife interrupts me right in the middle of it , " What are you saying ! Even here among the strangers of the Down , you speak of such things ! Here , sick and bloodied , and having done it for my sake , even as you faint , you speak of unimportant things ! " I say , " You speak as if of turnips . " " Make a speech if you must , but you would miss my turnips if I never grew them . " If she loves me still , or ever has , it 's for everyday things that amount to very little . I lose hope . I , the foreman of the Project , the killer of the lion , having made everybody safer , fall . I must have fainted at that very moment of losing heart , because of it in fact . Next thing I know I 'm in a bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been washed and rebandaged . My scratches no longer hurt . I 'm covered with a quilt the likes of which I 've never seen . It 's as light as if a froth . There 's a smell of stew . I had not thought the Down would be as comfortable as this . A woman sits near me . She 's dressed in long skirts and no red at all unless you count her rough red hands . They 're as large as mine , and are in her lap with her darning . Her face is wide and flat as the wide flat land that must have made it so . And here 's my wife , also wearing the skirts of the Down and no red . ( Those skirts must snag and tangle in their legs . They will have to be holding them out of the way . ) She looks so odd I have the thought that she 'll even talk as they do . I wonder what she 's been doing as I 've been lying here unconscious . She comes to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pushes the dog aside so that he licks my hand instead , and tries to get under the bandages . " So , " she says , " and after all this time . " I do n't know if she means that I 've finally awakened or that I 've finally killed the lion . " The catamount ! The catamount ! " The way she looks at me .... Her eyes must seem strange to the people down here , they are the bleached blue of us mountain people ( except for mine ) , but she looks at me as though I am the stranger . She says , " So you finally . " I think to tell her something of my love so I say , " I have feelings for more than just the Project . " She shakes her head , disgusted . She 's still ... even still , put out with me . Is there no gratefulness ? From anyone ? Lions can roam great distances , even in a single night , and they 're not easy to kill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end up with scratches and gashes , top to bottom . Our lioness may well have taken children from here also . All peoples will have profited from my daring . " I have risked the killing of it . " " Did you know , all this time , your name is n't Harrier ? Has never been ? They 've kept track of you down here . You 're easily seen from halfway up . The large in you belongs to them . Look how this chair is large . Look at the bed . Look how even their pots and pans are large . " She waves the spoon at me . " Here , look , a spoon as if for a giant . " " I have risked , " I say and then I turn away . She turns away , too , and lets the dog lick my face again . At least the dog . At least him . Time goes along here as there and I recover some . First I can do little more than sit outside , I and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap . It 's just as I used to sit of an evening up home with a dog all the way on my lap . I sit and learn things of the Down . I had n't thought there 'd be so much noise down here . Even all night long , cows and horses , dogs running off barking at things yipping with high voices . We do n't have coyotes up there . Later I walk around and see things . There 's both more and less mystery to it . I see how a plow works , how to yell out to cattle and yet keep them calm . " Curious as a cow , " they say down here , and it 's true , every time I hobble down their road , cows come to see what I 'm about and then follow me . The people call me Hosli It has no relationship to any bird that I know of . It seems Wren has become a sort of personage down here . I think because of her eyes and her size and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and graceful . Since she has few skills besides knitting and cooking and looking out for goats , what other reason can there be ? Her grace should be for my eyes and none other . Her hair also , for me only . Her cheeks .... ( I saw that first man we met , he 's called Boffin ... I saw him touch her cheeks , one forefinger on each side of her face , as if he thought to measure her . ) ( Why have they named me something without one of their endings on it , as Boffin , Duggan , Mawlin , and Algun ? Is it to insult me ? Do they laugh behind their hands at the shortness of my name every time they say it ? ) I 'll not be brother to the likes of them who look at Wren the way they do . So then I look at these women swishing around in their skirts ( as Wren is swishing now also ) . They 've fed me , spoonful by spoonful , washed me .... They have salves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that Wren should have been doing . They even look at me as Wren looks at Boffin , but everything about them only reminds me of myself . Even their necks are as wide as my own . I could borrow their shoes . Every day I wonder , where is Wren ? When I see her in the distance , I always take her for one of their children at first , before I see it 's her . There 's always several men around her . I 've killed the lion only for her . There comes a day of bad weather . Thunder and lightning , off and on hail even , right here in the Down as if on the mountains . Our weather  --  they say so themselves - come all the way down here , just as our water does . Rain is so rare everybody is out to see it and feel it protected only by their sun hats . Even I , though I 've already seen more of it than I need to . Clouds roil . The light is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains . And then , out from under thunderheads , exactly over the Project , only there , the weather suddenly clears . It 's as if the Project had done it . There 's only that one place with blue sky , and I see .... Yes , it is ! The capstone is raised . Perpendicular ! Atop the eight holding stones . Around it , a circle of clear weather , as though caused by it . And why not ? With that last boulder the Project is the highest of all the peaks surrounding it . In my wildest speculations I had n't thought such beauty . I 'd thought : monumental , majestic , exalted even , but not this loveliness . And from down here , such delicacy . And with the sun on it , such sparkle . This will show my wife the importance of important things , and the need . What would the sky be without it ? Just look at the faces of the people . And my wife , as wide-eyed as any of them . " There ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look ! That 's what I 've always meant . Can you say it was n't worth it ? " Even so , wide-eyed as she is , and all glittery with the look of our Project .... Even so , she leans toward me and whispers , " But Sparrow . " " And I 'm not there , " I say . I know I sound as though I do n't care about Sparrow . It 's that I do n't know what to say . What can I say ? What should I answer ? I say , " But I 'm not even there . " She says , shouting , " Do n't shout ! " Everybody looking up . Every single one of them - stunned at first , rain and tears flowing down their faces . Then the lightning lights their grins . They 're saying , " Well , well , well ! " and , " The little brothers of the Up have done it , " and other things of that nature . They pat me on the back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had n't taken years . Generations . As if it was n't a grand and noble , even an impossible thing . Do they realize the Project will be there longer than their little lives ? Do they know I was the foreman ? I limp away , I and the dog . I 've done with them . They have their arms around each other 's shoulders . They 're in a circle doing a skipping sort of dance , which , seeing how big they are , makes them look more ridiculous than ever . ( They 'll be dancing up there , too , stamping , jumping , also in a circle , though not touching . There was a special beer saved for just this day . ) " Hosh , " they say , and they open a space for me in their dance . " Little brother . Come . " To have more pats ? They say I 'm not well enough to return , but I 'm done with their over  --  watered fields ( wasting our water ) , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone the people . On the mountain we have more dangerous dangers , but they 're dangers more to my taste . If , for instance , some night we should steal a horse and ride out , fast , through the long straight flat places .... ( I have said to myself and long before , that I would n't return without Wren . ) I 'll tell her I 've loved her just as if she was the Project and for as long . Since she 's finally seen it as it should be seen , she 'll understand the importance of my love . How it sparkles . How it will last beyond either of us . But she wo n't come . I know it ahead of time : Yet again she 'll say , " What , what ! " I 'll say , " I killed the lioness only for you , " She 'll humpf . ( It 's the dog will follow me as a wife should . Try to . He 's old and arthritic . He likes somebody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I 'll say , you stay for the love of radishes the size of turnips , for chairs too big to sit on , for spoons that do n't fit your mouth . I risked my life , I 'll say . I say it , " I risked myself . " This is the beginning of everything that happens afterward . This and lightning , and hail , as it 's falling now , big as walnuts . I look up straight into it . They 've all run inside , even Wren , but I 'm used to worse . I-suppose they 're afraid of ruining their hats . Hats ! The meaning of the meaning of life , nor beauty either , has nothing to do with hats . Photograph <p>
