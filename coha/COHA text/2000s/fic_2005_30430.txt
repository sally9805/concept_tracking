The night air , a grim mixture of wind and slanting rain , hit Boldt 's face like needles . Seattle was a police beat where the weather could and did compromise a crime scene , often in a matter of minutes . On the advice of Bernie Lofgrin and his forensic team -- the Scientific Identification Division , or SID -- the department had issued foul weather directives for all first officers -- the first patrol person to arrive on the scene . Regulations now required plastic tarps and oversized umbrellas as mandatory equipment for the trunk of every cruiser . But mistakes were still made , and that night seemed ripe for them . As Boldt hurried up the home 's short poured-cement driveway , he faced the garage , behind and to the left of the house , a basketball hoop and paint-chipped backboard mounted to face the street . His attention fixed onto the SID van parked there in the drive . Of all the divisions , SID should have understood the importance of protecting evidence , should have respected the department 's attitude toward parking on private property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked in the victim 's driveway . One expected the occasional procedural error from the medical examiner 's chuck wagon , even tolerated it when , as had happened earlier that night , an ambulance had been required to carry away a victim , and so had likely parked in the drive . But as the collectors and keepers of evidence , SID had no excuse for parking in a crime scene driveway for any reason . Some SID tech had wanted to avoid the rain , that was all and that was n't good enough . The infraction incited Boldt 's temper , and in a rare display of emotion , he exploded at the first SID tech he encountered . He ordered the van relocated to the street . Privately , Boldt blamed the Blue Flu , SPD 's first sickout by its officers in the history of the department . The Flu had so overwhelmed morale that it now apparently offered even civilian employees -- like those who peopled SID -- an excuse to turn in shoddy , rushed work . He wondered what chance law enforcement had if the five-day-old sickout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the only outcome of the Flu -- officers , including Boldt , had been threatened by anonymous calls -- lines were being drawn . Violence bubbled beneath the surface . A first-degree burglary indicated an assault , in this case a broken neck and the possible rape of Sanchez , a cop . Boldt felt the urgency of the situation -- this case needed to clear before the press had a chance to run with it , before the press became fixated on the vulnerability of a police department weakened by Flu . Already on the job , detective Bobbie Gaynes offered Boldt and the investigation a ray of hope . Because of the Flu , and a lottery-like case assignment strategy that had the depleted ranks --  lieutenants and above , mostly -- accepting whatever cases Dispatch threw at them , this crime scene belonged to neither Boldt nor Gaynes , but to Lieutenant Daphne Matthews , whose official posting was that of staff psychologist . Boldt expected Matthews on the scene momentarily , even looked forward to it . They worked well together . A woman in her early thirties who regularly altered her looks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair cut short and colored a dark red . The heavy rimmed black Geek glasses and barely there makeup created a style that was a cross between hip urban single woman and computer programmer , which actually went a fair distance to describing her personality as well . Gaynes lived for computer chat rooms these days . Her prompt arrival on the scene came as no surprise . Boldt had personally brought Gaynes to Homicide following her stellar work on a serial killer case some years earlier . Before that , she had worked Special Assaults -- Sex Crimes , as her fellow officers called it . With the Sanchez crime scene initially reported as a burglary/assault , rape could n't be ruled out . Gaynes was a good detective to have on hand . Boldt kept expecting the press . The lights . The questions . They would need answers immediately . " You knew Maria Sanchez did n't you ? " Gaynes asked . " I know her personally , " Boldt corrected . " Yes . " " I only meant --  " Boldt interrupted . " She sat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kids loved her . " Violent crimes against fellow police officers held special significance for anyone carrying a badge . All crimes were not investigated equally -- a fact of life . Members of the immediate police family deserved and received special attention . Maria Sanchez would be no exception . Daphne Matthews arrived and checked-in with Boldt and Gaynes . As lead , Matthews handed out the assignments . Boldt deferred to her -- a reversal of their usual roles . Boldt thought of Daphne as a thoroughbred : dark , lean , fit and strikingly handsome . His system always ran a little quicker when in her presence , in part out of necessity . She possessed both a facile mind and a trained eye . Technically it was her case , but they would all three work the crime scene together . A civilian employee at first , a decade earlier Matthews had undertaken the six-week academy training so that she now carried not just a title but a badge , rank , and a weapon . She assigned Boldt the second floor crime scene where the victim had been discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first officer and speak to the SID team leader . Even though Maria had been whisked away in an ambulance , the importance and power of the crime scene preoccupied Boldt as he approached the bedroom . Out on the street , the first of the press arrived . There would be more . " How 'd we find her ? " Boldt asked Gaynes . He felt surrounded by women : Liz , Daphne , Gaynes , his own CAPers captain , Sheila Hill , even his little Sarah . He felt isolated but not alone , actually far more comfortable surrounded by these women than by a bunch of car-talking , sports-crazed men who commented on every chest that passed . He wondered why , of the seventeen detectives and two hundred uniformed patrol officers remaining on the job , some eighty percent were women . Why , when the going got tough , did the men quit and the women stay behind ? Maybe it would be the topic of one of his guest lectures over at the U. Boldt felt time getting away from him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pointed to a suspect . He might as well be asking for a miracle , and he knew it . Gaynes answered , " House has a silent alarm installed . Security company telephoned the home when the alarm tripped , then responded in person , finding the place locked , then finally contacted us because they 're not allowed to kick a door . All told , it took about forty minutes before our officers arrived . " " Nice response time , " Boldt snapped sarcastically . " First officer was Ling . Patrolman . He kept the security guys out , made the necessary calls and did a pretty fair job of protecting the integrity of the scene . " Boldt said , " Matthews and I will visit the hospital on our way home . See how she 's doing . We not only want this one cleared , we need it cleared . A cop assaulted in the middle of the Blue Flu ? Press will have a heyday . " " Got it , " Gaynes confirmed . The bedroom where Detective Maria Sanchez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled of sweat and fear . Sanchez 's shoes , clothes and undergarments lay strewn across the pale carpet : gray blouse and dark pants heaped together to the left of the bed , underwear up on the foot of the bed , which remained made but rumpled . The woman 's bra lay up by the pillow . An SID tech was working the adjoining bathroom for evidence and prints . Boldt studied the layout carefully , snapping on a pair of latex gloves almost unconsciously . He circled the bed carefully , like a photographer planning a shoot . " No evidence of fluids , " he observed , " other than the blood on the pillow . Not much of it . " " The ligatures ? " Gaynes inquired , pointing to the head of the bed . Boldt noticed the two boot laces tied to each side of the headboard . He glanced back down to the floor and the ankle high black leather soled shoes missing their laces . His stomach turned . The scene was confused . It did n't feel right to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ambulance arrived , " Gaynes explained . Both laces had been cut with a sharp knife , though remained knotted where they had been tied to the bed . " Photos ? " The SID tech answered from the reverberating bathroom , " We shot a good series on her . " " Close-ups of the ligatures ? " Boldt inquired loudly . " Ca n't say for sure . You want it on the list ? " " Please , " Boldt answered , now at the head of the bed , studying one of the cut shoelaces himself . He 'd had a case earlier in the week involving rape and a young girl bound by shoelaces . The similarities were obvious . He regretted that . A serial rapist was the last thing anyone needed -- and most likely the first thing the press would suspect . " Done , " the tech answered from the bathroom . Boldt glanced around . " Tied the wrists , but not the ankles ? His earlier rape had been tied by all limbs . " The similarities suddenly lessened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmichael rape had made the news . Gaynes replied as if it were a test . " They worked this way together -- pupil and student . I caught that too , L.T. , and I could almost buy it if the bed were more of a mess . But a woman left with her legs untied ? The bed covers should be a mess . " " Boyfriend ? Lover ? We want this wrapped and cleared , " Boldt reminded her . Grossly understaffed because of the Flu , they each had too many cases to handle . A so-called black hole -- an unsolved case -- would incite the media and make trouble for everyone concerned -- Maria Sanchez most of all . She deserved closure . " You 're looking a little sick , L.T. " " Feeling that way . " Gaynes , standing on the opposite side of the bed from Boldt said , " On Special Assaults I worked dozens of rapes , L.T. " Unlike detective John LaMoia who out of habit addressed Boldt by his former rank of sergeant , Gaynes at least paid Boldt the respect of his current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his rank 's initials . " Maybe in one out of ten , the clothes are still in one piece . Usually torn to shit . No fluids ? Listen , if the stains are n't in the middle of the bed where you expect them , then you find them on the pillow or the bedspread or the vic 's underwear . But a clean scene ? You ask me , this is date rape . Look at those clothes ! Not a button missing ! Spread out in a line for Christ 's sake . " Boldt studied a large dust ring on the dresser . A television had been removed . A small gray electronics device bearing a set of wireless headphones lay in a heap to the side of the same dresser . He picked them up in his gloved hands . Gaynes said , " You use ' em so the spouse can sleep while you watch the tube . " " She was single , " Boldt reminded . " A visitor maybe , " Gaynes said . " Date rape , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets too aggressive . Accidentally snaps her spine and takes off . " " The television ? " he asked his former protege . " Stole it to cover up it was him . Make it look like someone broke in . The papers have been filled with stories about all the break-ins since the Flu hit . " Studying the headphones , Boldt said , " Maybe she just appreciated music or maybe she subscribed to the cable music channels . " He pointed to the stack of recent best sellers on Sanchez 's bedside end table . Boldt walked around the bed feeling a pit in his stomach . Gaynes traded places . Police ballet . Since the advent of the Flu , reports of robberies and burglaries were up exponentially . " We 'll want to check our sheets , " he suggested . " See if this fits any patterns . " " Got it , " she replied . She lifted the top book off the end table , an Amy Tan novel . " Bookmarked with a receipt dated two days ago . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we 're in the midst of a Flu , " Boldt pointed out . " Not like she has a lot of fun time . " " Maybe six , seven hours a night at home , max . " " So she did n't watch much television , " Boldt concluded . " Which means you 're probably right about the cable music . A hundred and seventy pages in two nights ? You think she 's been entertaining a lover ? " she asked rhetorically . " Sounds more like insomnia . " " Ask around the house about current boyfriends . " " I 'm telling you , a rapist do n't undress them like this , L.T. He tears her clothes off . It 's rage , not courtship . And if he goes to the trouble to tie her up , he rapes her hard or fires juice all over the place . We 're not seeing real good evidence here . She hollered to the SID tech , What 's that bathroom like ? " " It 's light , " the tech fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here at all . " Boldt migrated over to check the windows -- all locked -- so he did n't have to look at the bed while Gaynes talked so calmly about raping and beating and masturbating . Sex Crimes -- Special Assaults -- conditioned a detective in ways even a homicide investigator had a difficult time understanding . He looked out the window to where light from the house played on the small patch of backyard and the separate garage . " Her underwear 's clean , " Gaynes reported . " So 's the bra . This looks like someone she knew . And using shoe laces to tie her ? A necktie maybe . A belt . Something handy and fast . What 's the guy do : ask her to lie still while he unlaces her Hush Puppies and ties her wrists ? " " Maybe her neck was already broken , " Boldt suggested . " Maybe she was n't going anywhere . " " Then why tie her up at all ? " Gaynes asked , confusing the issue . An uneasy silence settled between them . Not a black hole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's another thing . The trauma supposedly occurred after she was tied to the bed ? Is that the general consensus ? Is that what we 're thinking here ? That 's what 's logical , right ? He ties her up to keep her still . Goes for oral sex or something . Yanks her head a little too hard and snaps her neck in the process ? Something like that ? But he does n't tie her ankles ? " she said skeptically . Boldt 's only mental image was of the other case -- little Leanne Carmichael , thirteen years old , the crotch of her pants cut away , her legs tied open . A dark basement . " I worked a rape/kidnapping earlier in the week . He tied up the girl with shoelaces . " " Carmichael , " she said . " The case remained open ; continued to make a lot of noise . " " We 'll want the SID lab to make comparisons . The same knots ? Anything connecting the two crimes ? " " The lab , sure , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " True enough . " Someone must have finally been moving the SID van , for headlights spread across the wet backyard . Boldt did n't like what he saw there . " I 'm going outside to look around , " Boldt said . " It 's nasty out there , " the SID tech cautioned from the bathroom . " Check her boots and meet me outside , " he told Gaynes . She cupped her hands to the window peering into the backyard . She knew Boldt well . " Now , " he reminded , his voice urgent . " Got it , " she said . Nasty . Gaynes tugged the Gore-Tex hood over her head . Boldt made a similar move with the collar of his green oilskin . He switched on a flashlight borrowed from a patrolman -- one of the ones with 6 D-cell batteries inside , enough weight to club a skull to pulp , the flashlight 's second function . Hunched over , he and Gaynes approached a disturbed area of mud in the backyard . They walked single-file , electing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house 's back door . " This is where he intercepted her ? " Gaynes suggested , dropping to one knee . " Looks like a possibility , " Boldt said . " But there 's no sign of dragging . " " Her shoes show mud . The tech bagged them . Black leather jacket , presumably hers , had a partial shoe print on the chest . A set of keys and a garage clicker in the pockets . " She added , " And yes , I 'll have the shoe print typed , if possible , " anticipating the request . Gaynes poked a raised rib of mud and grass with her gloved finger . " It 's recent enough . " Boldt kneeled beside her , the flashlight illuminating the disturbance . The grass looked like a rug scrunched up on a hardwood floor . Boldt tore some grass loose and sealed it into an evidence bag for lab comparison . He lived for such work -- his lifeblood . He heard more chaos around in front of the house . More press . More pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him unexpectedly , surprising him , a struggle and she goes down . " From behind them , Daphne spoke . " At first it 's a matter of survival for him : get her to shut up and get the hell out of here . But then there 's a change . Something primitive takes over . Primal . It 's about dominance now , about her struggling and him overpowering her . He finds he gets off on it . He wants more than to simply subdue her . He has to possess her . " " You 're buying the burglary ? " Boldt asked , peering up at her into the rain , the flashlight following . Even in the rain , Daphne Matthews looked good . " Help me out , " Daphne said . " Shoelaces on both wrists . Same as Carmichael , my thirteen- year-old rape victim . " " But not the ankles , " Gaynes said . " Not the ankles , " Boldt agreed meaning it for Daphne . This was a jigsaw , with three players picking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Daphne asked . " We 've got a crime scene with two MO 's . " Boldt said . " A burglar . A rapist . Neither fits perfectly . Why ? " Gaynes announced , " We 've either got ourselves a twisted burglar , or a greedy rapist . " She tugged on her hood . A trickle of water slid down her cheek and dripped off her chin into her shirt . Knowing full well it would be his next request , she asked , " You want SID to work this site ? " " It 's a start , " Boldt agreed . Daphne said , " Leanne Carmichael was raped . There 's no medical evidence yet Sanchez was . " " And if she was n't , then you 've got yourself a couple of contradictions , " Boldt suggested . " I do n't want contradictions . I want a suspect . I want to clear this before it gets out of control . " Daphne sounded unusually nervous . She was n't used to leading a high profile case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boldt shined the light over toward the garage . " She parked in the garage and headed for the back door . She either ran into this guy --  " " Or he was out here waiting , " Daphne interrupted . " I want to assign a guard outside her hospital room , " he said . " Lt ... You 're right , but who we gon na get to do it ? " a frustrated Gaynes asked . The Blue Flu had taken four out of every five officers off the force . " Notify hospital security . Let 's move her to a private room away from a stair entrance . We 'll require check-in at the nurse 's desk . Some guy realizes he hit a woman cop , and maybe he decides he does n't want any witnesses . Or maybe it 's a boyfriend , and the same thing goes . I want her under protection . " " Got it . " Boldt felt the pressure of the investigation then -- a sixth sense for a black hole and a case that would n't clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed this as well . " Contradictions , " he said . " Yes , " she agreed . " Not this case , okay ? " she pleaded . " We 'll each have six more cases on our desks by the time we get back , " Boldt reminded . Gaynes chimed , " And then our phones 'll start ringing and Dispatch will dish out another couple each . " " We need the sickout over with , " Boldt said . " Dream on , L.T. They 're firmly entrenched . " Daphne saw her investigation headed for a black hole . " With Sanchez gone , " she said , " we 're down to sixteen investigators left -- detective or higher . " Boldt felt sick inside . A thirteen-year-old raped . A policewoman paralyzed . A burglar on the loose . The public was certain to panic . The Emergency Communication Center 's 911 lines would be crippled with hundreds of bogus reports and sightings . Seventeen detectives had become sixteen . " The press is going to screw us on this one , " Gaynes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " agreed Boldt , " that 's just what we do n't want . " He had come here hoping for evidence . Perhaps the contradictions were the place to start . They did n't offer him much . Daphne remained angry about the Flu . " It 's a fellow officer ! They 've got to come back on the job now ! It 's time to circle the wagons . " " I would n't count on it , " Boldt and Gaynes said nearly in unison .
