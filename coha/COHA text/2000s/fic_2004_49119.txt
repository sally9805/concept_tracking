We asked Mr. Stoddard if this epic tale was written in response to the events of 9/11/01 . He said no , that his main influences included James Macpherson 's translations of the ancient Gaelic epics of Ossian , Fingal and Temora , but then he added that " I think the new patriotic climate made it easier for me to think that someone would want to read this kind of story . " Born in Kansas and raised in Oklahoma , James Stoddard has called Texas home for the last two decades . He is the author of two novels , The High House and The False House . <p> THREE THOUSAND YEARS have elapsed since the passing of America . Though scholars have uncovered multitudes of valuable archaeological evidence , little written literature exists from that era . It is indeed unfortunate that books made of paper were replaced by magnetooptical disk storage by the middle of the twenty-first century . The worldwide magnetic field disaster of the twenty-second century did more than herald a new Dark Age - it erased the literature and history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities and landmarks . Fortunately , near the end of the twenty-seventh century , an unknown scholar passed through the American regions , collecting the stories and legends we now call the " Americana . " Though we can expect little accuracy from a people dependent on electronic data storage rather than oral tradition , we believe there is always a grain of truth concealed within the tales . But to quote one of the figures from the Americana itself : " When the Legend becomes fact , print the Legend . " Young General Washington rode alone on his white stallion through the Sequoia Forest . His battle-axe , Valleyforge , hung glistening from the pommel of his saddle , the blood fresh-scrubbed from its edge . he had slain too many soldiers in the war against the Gauls and American Natives , and was glad to be going home . I will never fight again , he thought , but will return to the Mount of Vernon to become a surveyor and farmer . There was no pursuit more important to any country than to improve its agriculture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple cares of a husbandman . He brooded on the horrors of war , his dead comrades , and the American Native maid , Pocahontas , whom he had loved . he loved her still , though she had betrayed him to the Gauls . In his people 's language his name , General , meant pertaining in common to all , and that was what he had become , a leader to the American tribes in Virginia . As a youth , an enchantment had been laid on him by the Wise Woman , Betsee Ross , the Star Weaver , that he could never tell a lie . Because of this , some called him " Honest Gen. " As the last rays of twilight turned the ancient American forest golden with dust and sent the shadows streaming east , he heard the cry of the hawk and the distant howls of wolves . he shivered uneasily . The sequoias rose all around , hundreds of feet tall , the trees the American Natives called the Silent Giants . His men had accompanied him through most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by going through the woods . Even the bravest had refused to follow him then , for the forest was said to be haunted . At the time he had thought it just as well , - he had wanted to be alone , to try to forget . he had intended to pass through the woods and into the safety of Virginia before nightfall , but weariness had overtaken both him and his mount , and in his brooding he had dawdled . He dared ride no farther that night for fear of losing his way . Already shapes grew gray and indistinct . The howling of the wolves sounded nearer . If I continue , I will lame Silver , he thought . he stroked the stallion 's neck , then reined him to a stop . he dismounted , then led him forward a few paces , intending to make camp beneath one of the great trees . The shadows seemed to close around him . The hoot of an owl overhead startled him . " My nerves are frayed , " he said softly . General removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . he was unconcerned about the stallion wandering off ; the horse was loyal as a hound . Silver nickered uneasily , as if he , too , distrusted the woods . " Easy , boy , " General murmured automatically . Though he preferred traveling unseen through the forest , he needed to start a fire to ward off the wolves . Picking up twigs and dead limbs , he soon had enough wood to last the night . He knelt with flint and steel . Sparks flew and a tiny dribble of flame sprang up . Before he could fan it into a full fire , Silver nickered again . General looked up , then stood , his hand to Valleyforge . A spectral green light haloed the enormous tree trunk . Washington crept around it and looked across the forest floor . A man approached , a tall , inhumanly broad figure carrying a lantern that glowed with an unearthly luminance . Washington felt his mouth go dry , his heart pounded against his chest , for he thought he recognized the intruder . he wanted to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought him . he drew Valleyforge and held it close . The figure paused a few feet from Washington . The lantern light spread at General 's feet , turning the ground emerald and olive . " General Washington , " the figure said , his voice a deep drawl . " I am Waynejon . Some call me the Pilgrim . " " Have you come for me ? " General asked . Despite his best effort , his voice trembled . The Pilgrim rumbled a laugh . " I 'm not death , if that 's what you mean . I 'm a man . I put my pants on one leg at a time . " Washington remained unconvinced . According to legend , the Pilgrim had died many times , but death could not keep him , for he was cursed to walk the Earth until the end of the age because of an ancient wrong . He stood a head taller than Washington , who was a tall man himself , and wore a square , black hat with a buckle at its front , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyepatch covered one eye and a rooster stood on his left shoulder . he carried an ancient blunderbuss . " You look like you 're getting ready to eat . If you 'll share your fire , I have some salted beef in my pack . " General nodded , then finding his voice , tried to sound confident . " What brings you to the woods ? " " As a matter of fact , I 've been looking for you . " " And then , " Waynejon concluded , " the boys got the cattle to the railhead . " Washington laughed and sighed . The fire cackled warmly before the pair . They sat across from one another , the flames between them . In the last hour , General had lost most of his fear . " An excellent tale . Whatever happened to the lads ? " " They turned out to be good men , most of " em . But they 're all long gone to their reward on Boot Hill by now . " In the subsequent silence Washington found himself asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You get to the point . I like that . " The Pilgrim took a drink of coffee from a tin cup , then gestured with it toward the woods . " This country , this new land , it 's wild , untamed . It could be a great nation , different from any other , a place where people could come from all over the world . A place of freedom . " " We all want that . It 's why my forefathers came . " " Mine did the same . They fled the dark realm of the Old World to escape the tyrants . But it 's not enough , General . The people are n't free . " " We 've driven the Gauls back to France . " " But you did n't get Prince Louis . " Washington shrugged . " He escaped to Mexico . No American can cross the RiO Grande and live . An enchantment prevents it . " " He 's done more than escape . He 's made alliance with the Huns . " Washington drew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led by their leader , Hitler , the Wolf Prince , were a constant threat , raiding the coasts on their dragon-headed ships , striking and then fleeing . Was there never an end to peril ? " And it 's not just Louis and Hitler , " Waynejon said . " There 's a powerful wizard living in the dark regions of the Canadian north , whose heart is cold as the bitter winds that blow there . The Mounties ca n't stop him because he 's conjured a giant from the Old World , tall as a mountain . They 're climbing down the steep cliffs from the ice fields with their armies , preparing to march to York . The Huns , whose longships wait outside York Harbor , have promised the wizard great rewards if he helps them conquer America . The Gauls are reforming along the Rio Grande . We 're in danger , General . " " What can we do ? " " Only the Words of Power in the iron box on Mount Rushmore can stop the giant . The titan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A chill ran along Washington 's spine . " None have ever gone there and returned . " " It does n't matter what others have done , General . I 'm asking you . " " It was not my intention to seek further adventures . " " You gained a reputation in your battles against the Gauls . " " I heard bullets whistle , and believe me , there is something charming in the sound . " Waynejon laughed . " Sarcasm does n't suit you , General . " " I meant none . By the miraculous care of Providence , I was protected beyond all human expectation , for I had four bullets through my coat and two horses shot under me , yet escaped unhurt . It was an exhilarating experience , but one I have little desire to repeat . " He shook his head . " I fear you have chosen the wrong man . " " How do you figure ? " Washington hesitated , not wanting to say the words . " My men love me , but though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't true , at least not for me . I was the one who began the war against Gaul , when I urged the Virginian governor , Dimwiddie , to build Fort Necessity at the joining of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers . Had we not confronted the Gauls there , the colonies might have been spared much bloodshed . There should have been another way . " Under my leadership , we struck out to attack Fort Duquesne . Though I knew better , out of my own vanity , we went like soldiers on parade , for I thought our movements were unknown . In my pride I had told our plans to ... someone I cared for deeply ... someone who betrayed us . We were unexpectedly attacked by three thousand Gauls and American Natives , and though our numbers were nearly thrice their own , my men were struck with such a deadly panic that nothing but confusion and disobedience of orders prevailed amongst them . We broke and ran as sheep before the hounds . If Braggart had not reinforced us at the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mighty commander , was wounded behind the shoulder and into the breast . He died three days after . " No , Pilgrim . I , a failure in all I have undertaken , am not the man to perform this deed . You must place your trust elsewhere . " Waynejon took a long sip of coffee . " Seems to me that 's the thing about this country , General . It 's a land of second chances . Someone must go or America is lost . " Washington , who had ducked his head in shame , looked up into the Pilgrim 's steady eyes , and for a long moment they held each other 's gaze . Finally , General said , " If I make the attempt , who will help me ? " " Near the slopes of Rushmore waits the Iron Hewer . Go to him . He will show you the way . " Washington stared into the fire and sighed . War had found him again and he could not refuse . Human happiness and moral duty were inseparably connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil than to rectify mistakes , " he said . " I will set out tomorrow morning . " " That 's good . That 's mighty fine . " Waynejon set his tin cup down . " I have to be on my way . Thanks for the grub . " Without another word , the Pilgrim rose and strode into the woods , his broad back disappearing into the shadows . Washington shivered , feeling very much alone . FOR SEVEN DAYS General rode through the Sequoia Forest , and on the eighth reached the wheatcovered plains of Kansas . The whole Earth shook with the pounding hooves of herds of buffalo pursued by the valiant Comanches , who looked dreadful in their war paint . To escape their notice - for they had no love of the white man - Washington hid himself among the amber waves of grain . At night , storm clouds built in the south and swept over the plains , the lightning tearing at the sky , the tumult of the thunder reminding Washington that should he survive Rushmore , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country of Mount Ana , a stark land , all sky and earth , and came in the evening to the banks of the Little Bighorn , where sat a rider on a white horse caparisoned in midnight blue . The rider , too , who had a golden mustache and penetrating blue eyes , wore blue and gold , with a deep blue cape . His curling hair , falling down to the middle of his back , shone like ripe wheat in the Sun . But Washington did not believe fine clothes necessarily made for fine men , any more than fine feathers made fine birds . " Hurrah , good sir , " the stranger called . " What brings you to the banks of the Bighorn ? " " I am Washington , who can not tell a lie , a son of Virginia . I seek the Iron Hewer on the slopes of Rushmore . " " Then you seek death , " the stranger replied . " I am Custard , named for the creamy white of my skin and my golden hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Horsemen , Captain of the Seventh Cavalry . " Washington quickly perceived this Custard had no lack of vanity , though he was indeed a mighty warrior . But General said , " I have never been to Rushmore before . Perhaps , if you know the way ? " " Why do you want to go there ? " " I seek the Words of Power to defeat the Wizard of Canada . " Custard gave Washington a long look before replying . " I will take you at least part of the journey , though I can not stay long . I have unfinished business here . The Sioux have risen against me . " Washington nodded . " I thank you for your kindness . " Together the two set off toward Rushmore . Along the way , Arm Strong told tales of his many deeds . Though he listened politely , Washington found such boasting distasteful , for it had always been his motto to show his intentions through his works rather than his expressions . " And someday , " Custard said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east to west , and men everywhere will praise my name . " " I am unfamiliar with the word , president , " Washington said . " Like a king , but even greater , presiding as judge over the land . " " Perhaps , " Washington said , thoughtfully , " if the Huns and Gauls can be driven back . But even a president should answer to the people . " " The people should answer to their liege lord , not the other way around . " " That is the old way , the manner of kings and queens , " Washington said , as he stared out at the endless horizon . " Like all the dark necromancy of the Old World , it should best be forgotten . It will not be like that here . The purpose of all government , as best promoted by the practice of virtuous policies , ought to be the aggregate happiness of society . As the Pilgrim told me , America should be a place where everyone has a voice . " " You have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was the one who sent me . " Arm Strong fell silent then , in awe of General Washington , and dared brag no more of his own accomplishments . After two days " travel they reached the Black Hills of Dakota , where they rode through the gloom of a perpetual twilight , for the Sun never shone there and eternal shadows lay across that country . As they struggled through the gloom , Washington spied a great eagle watching them from the back of the carcass of a bull buffalo , which the bird had apparently slain . As the travelers passed , General gave a respectful bow from his saddle , calling out , " Greetings , Master of the Air . I see you will have a fine feast . " But the eagle only watched the men with unwinking eyes . That evening , they came to a valley ringed in jutting peaks , and had traveled only a short distance when a cold voice called down to them from the heights . " Who dares trespass on the aeries of the eagles ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stood an eagle twice the size of a stallion . " I am Washington , " General said , " with my companion Arm Strong , seeking passage to the Mount of Rushmore . " " This day we will surely break your bones , " the eagle screeched , " for I am E. Perilous Union , mother of the eagles who make their homes both in the Peaks of Usps and the Mountains of the Moon . " Other , smaller eagles , lurking on the lesser crags encircling the travelers , raised their voices in reply . " Hear us , I beg you , " General called , in as brave a tone as he could muster . " Spare us , not for ourselves , but for the sake of our mission , for we are on a journey for the freedom of our countrymen . " A ruffling of wings passed around the heights . " Freedom ! " E. Perilous cried . " Freedom ! You speak the sacred word of the eagles . What is the meaning ? " " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " Mother , " another eagle called across the heights . " Let us spare these men who speak of Freedom , for when I met them on the plains , the palefaced one bowed and addressed me with respect . " " Is this so ? " E. Perilous Union asked . " Tell us then , children of men , the purpose of your journey . " Washington did so , and when he was done , E. Perilous said , " We have heard of this evil wizard and despise his ways . Because my son , Apollo Leven asks it , I will permit your passage . More , in the sacred name of Freedom , I will send him with you as a guide . " Washington and Custard thanked the mother of the eagles , and Apollo Leven lifted himself off the heights to accompany them . As they continued through the Black Hills , wolves and evil spirits tried to destroy them , and more than once they battled for their lives , but Washington , his face grim and terrible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shone silver in the darkness ; and Arm Strong , wielding a golden blade , proved dreadful in combat . Apollo Leven strove beside them as well , and his terrible beak and talons slew many a foe . The eagle led them true , and they finally saw Mount Rushmore looming in the distance , awful and majestic , a living monster shaped like a mountain with four heads . The heads were craggy and ill-formed , and shifted from side to side , guarding against danger . " The Iron Hewer lives at the base of Rushmore , " Arm Strong said , " where the behemoth can not reach him . " They came by twilight to a house made of iron . As they approached , a figure stepped out dressed in simple gray garments and bearing no arms . Around his otherwise bald head he wore a circlet with five silver stars that glistened in the dusk . Washington expected to be challenged , but the man raised his hand in salute and gave a slow smile . " Welcome , strangers , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends call me Ike . " Washington found he liked Ike immediately , and the two travelers dismounted and introduced themselves . When General told Eisenhower why he had come , the Old Commander shrugged . " Though I have never liked war , I wo n't shirk from a fight , not if Waynejon sent you . " From out of his larder , Eisenhower prepared a fine meal , though where he got his victuals Washington could not guess . Afterward , full and content , they sat before the fireplace , drinking hot coffee and smoking tobacco from wooden pipes , listening to the wind whistling around the iron eaves , while Apollo stood in a corner , his eyes reflecting golden in the flames . " There is only one way to approach the creature , " Ike said . " All its heads face south , except for the fourth one , which looks to the north . But that head is blind in one eye . If we 're careful , we can creep up the northwestern slope . The box containing the Words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chins . We 'll know if it sees us , for its faces , which normally resemble rough stone , always take on the features of its victims . " " Can the monster be slain ? " Custard asked . " He can , " Eisenhower replied . " A single blow to the mountain 's heart can kill the beast , if the warrior who delivers it is pure of soul . " " Who knows if such a man is among us ? " Washington asked . " I would like to try my hand at it , " Custard said , " if the chance arises . " " Such a task is not for me , " Eisenhower said . " I am unworthy , for I 've sent too many men to their deaths . " " Is that why you live here alone ? " Custard asked . " A warrior such as yourself would be highly honored in York . " " I live here to serve and have had all the honors I need . I have led good men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives acclaim earned in the blood of his followers and the sacrifices of his friends . " " I have not fought for such , sir , " Custard said , " but for the glory of combat . You give me much to consider . Still I would like to set my good right arm against the monster . " " The Pilgrim sent me here many years ago , to act as a guide . There is a prophecy that one day a man will destroy the creature and use the Words of Power to preserve the land . I hope you are that one , but many have scaled those slopes and none have lived to tell of it . " " These are strange times , " Washington said , " filled with magic . " " True , " Ike replied , sagely , " but things are more like they are now than they have ever been before . " Washington nodded his head and stared into the fire . It was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THREE COMPANIONS rose with the morning light . They left their horses in Eisenhower 's iron stables and went on foot , angling toward the west , while Apollo wheeled away to watch from a distance , lest his presence alert the four faces . If the monster saw them , it gave no sign . By midday they reached a region strewn with boulders , where they were near enough to see the heads closely . Washington gaped up at them . Three faced toward the men , one away . They were large as houses , and all looked identical , with gray eyes , weather-beaten noses , and thin lines for mouths . Their guttural voices rose and fell , as they murmured among themselves in an ancient tongue . The travelers headed north until they came to a point behind the mount , where only the easternmost face kept watch , its left eye staring vacantly down the slope . " We begin the assault here , just before sundown , " Eisenhower said . " Should n't we wait until dark ? " Arm Strong asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the day , but at twilight the setting Sun will be in their eyes . " For three restless hours the companions waited for sunset , saying little , thinking of the coming encounter . Custard stared fixedly at the mount . " Ike , " Arm Strong finally said , " exactly where would the killing blow have to be struck ? I can not rightly ascertain the location of the beast 's heart . " Eisenhower pointed . " There , just between the two central heads . Front or back makes no difference . " " And the Words of Power ? " Washington asked . " A few yards farther down in a narrow cave . It 's hard to see from here . " " You have guided us well , " Washington said . " You need not accompany us . " " I do n't have to , but I will . I 've always stood with those who make the attempt . " When the Sun was still three finger widths above the horizon , Eisenhower ordered the travelers to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the blind side of the head , and were soon scrambling up the mountain slope . Pine trees provided concealment until they were two-thirds of the way up , but after that the mount lay barren . Washington 's heart pounded in his chest as he climbed , trying not to look up at the terrible face above him . At first he could not see the cave , but then he spied it , a narrow opening half-covered by an overhanging shelf . If they could reach it , the head would not be able to see them at all . Abruptly , the terrible visage turned , with the sound of rock scraping on stone , and the three flattened themselves against the boulders , scarcely daring to breathe . For a moment the good eye swept along the slope , but the sunlight blinded it , making it squint and look away . The men kept climbing . Custard was the first to reach the cave , and he helped the others under the protection of the ledge . They clapped one another on the back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a niche in the rocks , and Washington searched only a short while before finding the iron box set in a recess . It proved neither long nor heavy , and he drew it out easily and opened the lid , which needed no lock with such a terrible monster guarding it . Within lay a brown parchment . " The Words of Power , " Washington whispered . He placed the scroll within his breast pocket and slipped the box back into its place . " Have any ever come this far before ? " Custard asked softly . " Only two , " Ike said . " Their bones are strewn across the slope . " Shuddering at Elsenhower 's words , Washington told the Old Commander to lead them back down . They were nearly to the tree line again before Washington realized Custard was not behind him . He turned to discover Arm Strong ascending the mount . General clutched Eisenhower 's arm and pointed to their comrade . " That vainglorious fool ! " Eisenhower hissed . Reaching the region above the monster 's heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Die , beast , in the name of Arm Strong , Captain of the Seventh Cavalry ! " He looked magnificent at that moment , his cape billowing , his golden hair sweeping back behind his head , the last rays of the Sun glinting on his blade . With all his power , he thrust downward . The sword snapped beneath the weight of the blow , leaving Custard gaping at it in astonishment . A scraping noise filled the heavens as all four of the monster 's heads swiveled toward the captain . General gasped , for the faces had transformed into the features of Custard , Washington , and Eisenhower . Only the head with the blind eye remained unchanged . The air filled with roaring as the heads screamed their rage . The whole mount trembled as vast arms rose from either side , reaching toward Custard . " Let 's go ! " Eisenhower ordered . " He wo n't make it . " " No , " Washington cried , handing Ike the parchment . " Take it and flee ! " General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinting toward Custard , Valleyforge at the ready . Though it had taken several minutes to creep down the mount , he ascended in seconds and was beside Arm Strong as the giant arms groped toward both of them . Washington saw his own face , filled with hatred , glowering down upon him . Do I really look like that ? he thought . My nose seems so large . At that moment Apollo Leven streaked from the sky to harrow the faces with his talons . But the action bought the men only a moment before the rocks erupted around them , lifting them off the ground and sending them sprawling down the incline . Custard 's expression was wild , but he held a knife in his hand as he rolled to his feet . Washington scrambled back toward the mountain 's heart , axe upraised , staring straight into his own seething eyes . The mount rippled beneath him , but as he fell he brought his axe down on his target with all his strength . He expected nothing but the destruction of his weapon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rock . The whole mount screamed , a deafening blast . Blood rilled from the wound , covering General in ichor . He rolled on his back and saw the faces above him , including his own , writhing in their death struggles . He watched himself expire , the light leaving the eyes , the head lolling downward . The mountain shuddered and sank . The four dead faces stared across the plain . For a moment , Washington could hear nothing , but finally Custard 's voice came to him , as the captain helped him up . " You have shamed me , sir , and saved my life . I am in your debt forever . " Eisenhower reached them a moment later and fell immediately to his knees before Washington . " You are the one , " Ike cried , taking the circlet of five stars from his forehead and casting it at Washington 's feet . " The one who was to come . You have ended my vigil . Accept my service . Wherever you go , I will go also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I , too , will follow you , " Custard said , though he did not kneel . " Accept my service as well , General . " Scarcely understanding their words , Washington gaped up at his defeated foe . " But how ? " he exclaimed . " How could a failure such as I be named worthy to destroy the beast when Arm Strong could not ? " Apollo glided to a landing and placed his large head under General 's hand . " Do not question the turn of events , Washington Paleface , but accept the fealty of these men , and mine as well , for I , too would follow you . " Still overwhelmed , Washington laid his hands on the shoulders of the two men . " I do not understand , nor know where this will lead , but I can not refuse the service of such brave warriors , nor of this great eagle . Now rise . We have a giant to kill . " " Another ? " Ike asked . They spent the night in Elsenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his garments . In the morning they left Rushmore far behind , and the four dead heads gaped at them to the edge of the horizon . They rode once more across the darkness of the Black Hills , and as they went Eisenhower asked , " General , why did you go back for Custard ? You had the scroll . If you and I had died , there would have been no one to stop the wizard . " " I could not leave him behind . " " If a commander thinks expending ten thousand lives will save twenty thousand later , it is up to him to do it . " " Custard was not ten thousand , but one , " Washington said . " And though you have a point , I labor to keep alive in my breast that little spark of celestial fire called Conscience . I could not desert him and live with myself . " They passed back into Mount Ana , where Custard seemed to grow increasingly nervous .

Sweat broke across Arm Strong 's brow , but he said nothing . " What do you want ? " Washington asked . " Your people have sinned and there must be death , " the sitting bull said . " I have done it ! " Arm Strong burst forth . " I am not what you think me , General . I admit it , now . I have shed the blood of children . I spoke before of unfinished business .

" For a moment Arm Strong 's eyes became crafty . But he looked at Washington and shook his head . " No , General . I have been a villain , but you returned for me on Mount Rushmore when I would not have done the same for you . You must live to fight the wizard . My fate is sealed . You have shown me the way to restore my honor , and I will go with the Sun shining on my face . " Custard bowed low to Washington , then strode down the hill toward Bitter Gall , passing out of the story and into history . But Washington wondered if someday , he too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his men in the battle of Fort Duquesne . WASHINGTON and Eisenhower , grieving at Custard 's loss , made their way through the Sequoia Forest , where they had many adventures . At last they came to York , a city of magnificent spires . Others heard tell of Washington 's heroism on Mount Rushmore , and warriors came to him offering him their service , so that he gathered a group of America 's finest around him . Of these , Lafayette DeGaul was one of the greatest . Though a Gaul , he had vowed to follow Washington when General had saved his life many years before , and had been with him through the Gaul and American Native War . " Mon General , " Lafayette said , " it is good to see your face . The wizard , accompanied by his giant , approaches the city and is encamped beyond the banks of the Mighty Delaware . Those sent to stop it have been smashed to bits . I was just preparing to go myself , to die for the cause of freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plumed hat . Until he met Washington , he had been a member of the famous Musketeers , who had fought against the powers of darkness and evil in the Old World . Washington assembled his company , which had grown to more than five hundred men , just inside the gates of York . As he looked upon them , despair ran through him , for they were poorly armored and had few supplies , the Hun 's blockade of the harbor preventing needed goods from entering the city . Despite his reservations , he drew a deep breath and addressed them briefly , explaining the situation . He ended with : " The time is now near at hand which must determine whether Americans are to be Freemen or Slaves . The fate of untold millions will depend , under God , on the courage and conduct of this army . Our cruel and unrelenting enemy leaves us no choice but a brave resistance or the most abject submission ; this is all we can expect . We have , therefore , to resolve to conquer or die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leven wheeled and cried overhead . Knowing how few warriors he had , Washington ordered a special surprise in the form of large , mysterious crates loaded onto the supply wagons . As they rode out through the gates of York toward the Canadian Ice Fields , a crowd assembled to watch them go , young women pinning flowers and kisses on the warriors . Washington was approached by one of the most beautiful ladies he had ever seen , with pouting lips and eyes that flashed like fireworks . Her dark hair flared long and wild over a necklace hung with wooden teeth , suspended over a dress of forest green . She handed him a red , white , and blue standard covered with thirteen stars and stripes . " Take this , General , " she said , " and fight for York . The Star Weaver herself has enchanted it , washing it in the tears she sheds for those who die beneath the titan 's heels . Tie it to your axe-handle in your moment of need , and its magic will give your blade power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back to take the cloth , and for a moment their hands and eyes met . " What is your name ? " he asked . " Martha Custis . " " I thank you for this , " Washington said . She smiled and watched him ride away . " She is a beauty , that one , " Lafayette said . " There is no time for such things , " Washington replied , but his hand felt warm where she had touched it , and he raised the standard high . For three days the company traveled north , and by the second afternoon icy winds began to blow . Snow flurried by evening , and the warriors soon rode through banks of white . It was bitterly cold , and Washington 's men lacked sufficient clothing . By midafternoon the company reached the edge of a valley , where ran the Mighty Delaware River . In the vale 's center stood the giant , Britannia the Great , hundreds of feet tall , an enormous creature with the face of a woman , wearing a crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . Wherever it walked or struck , it flattened houses , fields and living things , a brutality that came to be known as the Stamp Act . The wizard stood upon the titan 's shoulders and an army of ten thousand red-clad warriors followed behind . " How can we face them ? " Lafayette asked . " I have a plan , " General said . " But the Words of Power will not work unless the monster hears them , so I must be very close . We will wait until nightfall . " The snow fell harder as evening progressed . The men carried halfshrouded lanterns , but it was still difficult to see through the storm . Everyone shivered with the cold , but Washington led them to the banks of the Delaware , accompanied by the wagon filled with the mysterious crates . They found boats upon the shore , left there at Washington 's request by his American Native friend , Massasoit . In the dead of night , scarcely able to find their way , the company crossed the torrent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , white , and blue banner before him . He shivered from more than the cold , knowing that if the wizard or Britannia discovered them upon the waters , they would be doomed . After a long hour , they reached the farther shore . Washington divided the men into three sections , under the comrnand of Eisenhower Iron Hewer , Stonewall Jackson , and Benedict Arnold , three of his greatest warriors . Giving them their orders , General turned to Lafayette . " The rest is up to us , I fear . Come with me . " Washington took the banner Martha Custis had given him and tucked it beneath his cloak . Together , the two comrades crept toward the titan , whose gigantic form blocked the stars . They slipped between the sentries , then waited until moonrise . As the first rays lit the land , Lafayette called in a loud voice just outside the Wizard Cornwallis 's tent . " Come out , great magician , for we have seen your might and know we have no chance against you . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's camp leapt to their feet , but Lafayette drew his bow and covered them . " Stand back , my friends . We surrender to Cornwallis alone . " As the guards hesitated , the wizard appeared at the tent door , a dazzling lantern in his hand . Lafayette lowered his weapon . The wizard wore a bulky red robe and a white , pointed hood , which allowed only his dark eyes to show . His voice was grating as he spoke . " Who dares interrupt the slumber of Cornwallis , Grand Wizard of the Empire ? " " It is I , Lafayette DeGaul , with the great General Washington , who asks you to accept his surrender . " The giant , Britannia , gave a low rumble and raised its mace , but Cornwallis bid it stay its hand . " Why do you come slinking to me in darkness ? " Cornwallis demanded . " We came as quickly as we could , to end the bloodshed , for who knows what this behemoth of yours will do ? " Lafayette replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like your people , the wretched refuse of the Old World , vermin sent to pollute these fair shores , fit to be nothing but slaves . When York is overthrown , I will show you how such should be treated . " " We are willing to do as you say , " Lafayette said through gritted teeth . " Only accept our surrender . " " I have heard of you , Washington . It is said you can not tell a lie . Tell me then , commander , is that truly why you have come ? I will believe it from your lips . " Washington dared not answer , knowing the truth would spring unbidden from his mouth . " I thought so , " Cornwallis said , signaling to the giant . " Scatter ! " Washington ordered . The Americans moved just in time to avoid a shattering blow , as Britannia brought its mace down with all its force . The impact tossed Washington off his feet , but even before he hit the ground he was unrolling the scroll containing the Words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plan , to bring the giant close to the earth in striking . On landing , Washington instantly sprang up and began reading in a mighty voice . At the first word , everything seemed to freeze in place , as if time had stopped . Britannia remained immobile as Washington spoke : We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the Pursuit of Happiness . That to secure these rights .... On and on Washington read , his voice growing stronger with the reading , his delight rising as he saw the wizard and the giant both helpless against the words . He raised his arms as he ended : And for the support of this Declaration , with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our Lives , our Fortunes , and our sacred Honor . The moment General finished , Cornwallis fell to his knees . When he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his bow and placed an arrow through the wizard 's evil heart . " Liberty , Equality , Fraternity ! " cried Lafayette . Britannia gave a terrible scream , for the Words of Power began to turn its feet to stone . With a snarl , it fled toward the south , stomping away on increasingly clumsy members . A roar rose from the valley 's edge as hundreds of fireworks , the contents of the mysterious crates , were released at once . The sky erupted in red , white , and blue flares as Eisenhower , Arnold , and Jackson led the Americans into the valley toward the Red Army , which was milling in confusion , stunned at being attacked from a direction they thought safe . " The giant ! " Washington cried . " It heads toward York . " Washington and Lafayette captured two of their enemies " horses and sped after the titan , but clearly the mounts could not keep up . As soon as they reached their camp , Washington leapt off his steed and onto Silver , who stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go on ! " Lafayette shouted to Washington . " Go on , mon General ! I will catch up . " Faster than the wind Silver ran , while Washington kept his eyes upon the giant . But when he reached the banks of the Mighty Delaware , General found the titan had already crossed . He nearly despaired at that moment , until Apollo Leven streaked out of the sky and landed before him . " You must ride upon my back , " the eagle screeched . Still bearing the banner Martha Custis had given him , Washington climbed in front of Apollo Leven 's wings . The eagle took a single bound and streaked over the great river . Yet fast as they were , the monster strode far ahead . It steadily approached the gates of York , dwarfing the city 's gleaming spires . Washington was still some distance behind it as it raised its mace , preparing to sweep the city away . In desperation , General lifted Valleyforge and tied the banner to its pommel . As he let it fly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind , and as it flew it grew , powered by the flag 's enchantment . It struck Britannia full in the back , and the monster writhed away , stumbling as it went , its massive feet missing the gates of York . In its frenzy , it thrashed into the water . Most of its lower body was stone , and it moved with awkward , hesitant jerks . Crossing the bay , it pulled itself onto a massive rock rising out of the harbor . By the time it reached the top , its waist had turned to stone , leaving it unable to move its legs . Gradually the effect crept up its body . It raised its enormous mace in defiance and turned its face toward the sea , looking for its home across the waters . Washington 's axe , returned to its former size , fell from the giant 's back and clattered down the rocks . With the giant and the wizard destroyed , the Red Army , thinking the fireworks the beginning of an enormous assault , fled in terror . Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city in triumph , the whole company singing When General comes marching home again . Washington was declared a great hero and some wanted to make him king , but he refused , remembering Custard 's words of a new office of president . He recalled what the Pilgrim had said as well , and saw that America was indeed a land of second chances . The Gauls retreated from Mexico and Hitler drew his boats back across the sea . But though Washington searched through all of York for many weeks , he found no sign of Martha Custis , nor anyone who knew her . However , he did find his axe with the flag still tied to its pommel , on the shores of the rock where the giant stood . Afterward , a great Convention was held in honor of Washington 's victory . A tremendous plan was conceived to build an enormous door , gilded with gold , across York harbor , to prevent the Huns from ever attacking again . There was talk of tearing down the stone titan , but Lafayette had the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vanquished foe . And we will call it Lady Liberty , for with its defeat we have won our freedom . " Being a poet as well as a warrior , in mockery of the words the wizard had spoken , Lafayette etched the following lines upon the base of the rock where the giant stood : Give me your tired , your poor , Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free The wretched refuse of your teeming shore Send these , the homeless , tempest-tossed to me I lift my lamp beside the golden door ! The Convention ordered a flame lit atop the statue 's mace , that became a torch burning across the waters , so bright it could be seen from the shores of the Old World . And when the kings and emperors of that shadowy realm looked upon it , they trembled . <p>
