<br> The hall ahead is dark , a tunnel of black . <p> She is in bare feet , wearing just a T-shirt , her steps slow and reluctant on the polished hardwood floor . <p> The warm Southern California breeze breathes through gauzy curtains at the windows , wafting the fragrance of night-blooming jasmine . . . but the smell is cloying , gagging , and dread rolls like black waves around her as she approaches the door , their door . <p> The sounds are louder , now . . . the grunts and moans are like physical blows . She wants to scream , wants to run . . . and she ca n't breathe , ca n't breathe , something is wrapped around her chest like a vise . <p> In the night outside , a dog breaks into hysterical yapping ; somewhere far away a siren wails . Beside her , the Art Deco clock on the wall clicks to 3:33 . She steps past the ghost of her own reflection in the large gold-framed mirror . . . takes a jerking step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sight  --  <p> They are in the bed , their bed , Matt and  --  <p> I do n't even know her name , what 's her name ? <p> Tracey . <p> She can hear their breathing , Tracey 's soft moans , Matt groaning , " Baby . . . oh baby . . . " She can smell them , feel their frantic writhing  --  Matt 's quickening thrusts , Tracey 's legs flexing and tightening around his thighs . . . <p> Every move , every thrust , every sigh , is like being stabbed , all over her body . She can feel the jabs , feel the blood pouring from her flesh , the coppery stink of blood . . . she is wrapped in barbed wire and it is tightening , tightening . . . . Matt and Tracey cry out together on the bed . . . . <p> Inside her mind , she is screaming , her cries echoing against the walls . . . <p> Please . . . please no . . . <p> And behind her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shuddering gasp , felt her heart pounding crazily against the mattress , shaking the bed . The room around her was blindingly sunny , white and high-ceilinged , with crown molding and a ceiling fan . <p> Ceiling fan ? ? ? <p> Where am I ? ? ? <p> She lay against the pillows in total disorientation , waiting for the dream to subside , to regain some kind of reality . <p> Then she sat up slowly , in the bedroom of her house in  --  her mind scrambled briefly for it  --  Durham , North Carolina . <p> She had been there for three weeks and four days , after living all thirty-one years of her life in California . <p> And she had moved in a blind rush of escape , after finding her fiancT in bed with his graduate assistant , in exactly the scenario she had dreamed , down to the very last detail . <p> She swung her feet out of bed and stood , reached for a robe , avoiding looking at the mirror on the wall . <p> She belted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , past the door of the spare bedroom with its unopened moving boxes stacked against the walls , and down the stairs of her house  --  her house !  --  her feet bare on the cool of the polished wood stairs , her left hand gliding down the satiny curve of railing . So different from the right-angled , modern condo in West Hollywood , with its recessed lighting and skylights , and stainless steel , granite-countered kitchen . <p> And that 's the point , is n't it ? I 'm as far away as I could get . <p> The dream had followed , and it never felt like dreaming ; it was always the same , like walking into the living past , into a parallel world that existed intact and constant , with her trauma captured , her silent screams echoing forever on the walls . <p> But it was less frequent , and she no longer awoke from it with barbed-wire welts in her flesh . That 's some kind of progress , right ? <p> It was the dream that had told Laurel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her Santa Barbara hotel , where she was staying the weekend at an American Psychiatric Educators conference , with raised welts in her flesh and a shattered feeling in her chest . She did n't believe in psychic flashes , had never won so much as two dollars in the California lottery , did n't know who was on the other end of the phone when she picked up ; she never even read her horoscope in the newspaper or online . She had a doctorate in psychology , for heaven 's sake ; she lectured on personality and theories of the self at Cal State L.A. ; she had multiple job offers at universities in various parts of the country ( all of which she 'd turned down to stay in Los Angeles with Matt . . . ) <p> But the dream had been more than a dream . She 'd known . <p> At 1:23 a.m. she left the hotel , got in her car , and drove two hours back to their condo in L.A . . . and it was just as in the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing curtains , the yapping dog , the clock clicking over to 3:33 as she walked down the dark hall through waves of black dread , toward the sound of moaning coming from their doorway , their bedroom , their bed . . . <p> And the mirror . . . <p> In her mind she heard the shattering and halted on the stairs , gripping the banister , squeezing her eyes closed to shut it out . . . <p> Matt had moved out immediately , they had never even talked about it . It was almost as if he 'd staged the scene for Laurel to find , to spare himself the awkwardness of an actual conversation . He was out of her life , shacked up with Tracey . Just like that  --  unengaged . <p> Stop it , Laurel ordered herself , clenching her nails into her palms . What 's the point ? You were living in a dream world . <p> She had no illusions about what the real problem was . Los Angeles was a 24/7 candy store . Beautiful young people came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faces their fortune . Laurel knew she was pleasant enough to look at in a sexy librarian kind of way : glasses and braces long gone , and her unruly mane of red-gold hair less of a disaster than it had been in her coltish adolescence . And of course there were the legs that had stopped Matt in his tracks the night they met at a faculty Christmas party  --  or so he 'd said at the time . But Laurel knew she did n't even register on the Hollywood scale . <p> She 'd never really understood what Matt had seen in her , other than the fact that she simply listened well ; she 'd been sympathetic and available when he was shattered and mooning over being dumped ( By a model , no less  --  and should n't that have been your first clue ? ) . <p> No , she 'd been an utter fool , blindly trusting , delusional , stupid in every way . <p> Better to know now , Laurel 's friends , colleagues said . Of course she would heal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find someone new , someone worthy of her . We love you , you 'll be fine . All the things that well-meaning people say . <p> Laurel had nodded and thanked them and gone home and given notice on her condo , then called the Duke University psychology department to accept a tenure track professorship that she had n't even been considering , in the middle of North Carolina , a whole continent away . <p> She said all the right things to her dismayed friends : she could n't stay an associate professor at a state college forever , tenure track jobs were almost non existent in California , she was doing the best thing for her career . <p> All true , and all lies . The truth was she ran  --  ran away from Matt , away from L.A. , away from everything she 'd known . She wanted to be someplace that no one knew her , where there was no place that she could run into people she knew , where they could ask , brightly oblivious , about the wedding  --  or worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as if she had a communicable disease . The cheated fiancTe , the abandoned bride . . . <p> She became aware that she had reached the bottom of the staircase and was just standing , unfocused , at the foot of the stairs . She looked around her , breathing in , letting her present surroundings chase away the memories of L.A. <p> The house was bright , airy , and empty , two stories of old Southern charm , with a wide wraparound porch , ten-foot ceilings , heart-of-pine floors ( the realtor had said " heart pine " ) , a screened back porch , a walk-in pantry ( with a window ! ) , and curious small square doors in the walls of the master bedroom and hall and kitchen , which to Laurel 's utter amazement turned out to be functioning laundry chutes . The windows were hung on counterweights and had thick glass that rippled like water ; the front and back yards overflowed with wisteria and honeysuckle . The quiet of it all still astonished her  --  not just of the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Laurel had been looking for a rental but she 'd gotten lost on the way to an apartment appointment and found herself driving through a quaint and timeless neighborhood with gently curving streets and wide porches with white Southern rockers , a haphazard collection of bungalows and Victorians and barnlike Cape Cods . When she saw the open house sign in front of a gingerbread house with eight-paned windows , she stopped on a whim . The house was captivating and the price so surreally low ( compared to the still-stratospheric prices of Southern California ) she 'd found herself writing a down-payment check on the spot ( stunning the chatty realtor into silence ) , and moving into the place two inspections and a scant two and a half weeks later . It was a huge and outrageous decision that she 'd made in a matter of minutes , unlike her in every way . <p> But she was not herself ; she had no sense of what " self " meant anymore . And buying meant it would be harder to ever go back . <p> She walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally , empty : she 'd spent her entire savings on the purchase , therefore furniture was not really an option . She maxed out a credit card on a bed , a kitchen table with chairs , and a very large desk for her upstairs study . The kitchen boasted a refrigerator , a stove , and an eating alcove . The rest of the house was entirely bare  --  but then , so was Laurel , so the emptiness suited her . <p> She moved across the empty hallway and turned the latch of the door . <p> She opened it and looked out , like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz  --  and felt the familiar wave of unreality to see , instead of flat , sunny West Hollywood , the curved , tree-lined street , regal houses with their own wraparound porches with rockers and ceiling fans and hanging baskets of ferns , and yards with huge and lushly flowering trees . A car might pass once every ten minutes or so , and then the thick silence would descend again , laced with the subdued twittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimes , an occasional faraway train whistle , even the tolling of church bells . <p> A white-and-orange kitty with luminous gold eyes sat on the porch , centered exactly halfway between the doormat and beginning of the stairs , and looked up at Laurel expectantly . <p> " Still here , hmm ? " Laurel said to it wryly . " You 're a trouper . " <p> The cat waited beside the door while Laurel fetched the newspaper and then walked , flowingly , in front of her into the house , through the center hall , straight to the kitchen , where it sat beside the pantry door , waiting to be fed . The morning after Laurel had moved in she 'd opened the front door and the cat had walked in as if it owned the place . The cat was light years ahead of Laurel in confidence , and she figured she could learn something from it , so they had been cohabitating ever since , the cat on one pillow of the new bed , and Laurel on the other . Laurel had yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would let her know in its own time how it wished to be addressed . <p> She tried not to think what it meant to be so vulnerable that a strange cat could dictate her life . <p> She reached for the coffeepot that she 'd programmed the night before , and her eyes fell on the window . <p> She looked out on her lovely , alien neighborhood and thought for the millionth time , What am I doing here ? What have I done ? <p> But it turned out to be the day that she found out . <p> Excerpted from THE UNSEEN by Alexandra Sokoloff <br> Copyright 2009 by Alexandra Sokoloff <br> Published in June 2009 by St. Martin
