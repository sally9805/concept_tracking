Democrats are closing in on a Senate royal flush . <p> Although still a long shot , they have raised their goal to a magic and rare 60 members , a filibuster-proof majority of enormous significance . <p> Depending on how things break Nov. 4 in a handful of states , Democrats could move from a tenuous Senate majority to that filibuster-proof margin for the first time in three decades . Republicans have n't had such a margin since 1911 . If Democrats also keep their House majority , which is all but certain , and win the presidency , they would wield power unrivaled in Washington since Democratic President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 . <p> The filibuster is a quirky but potent weapon that allows a minority of 41 in the 100-member Senate to block - and just as important , influence - all legislation before it even gets to the president . If Democrats win the White House , the filibuster would be the last institutional power left to the GOP . <p> Republicans , who for months have been measuring success in this election not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose , have taken lately to campaigning on the dangers of unchecked political power . Democrats currently hold a working 51-vote Senate majority . Nine more would put them at 60 , and they might not even need that many if they can lure remaining GOP moderates on big issues . <p> Top Senate analysts are putting Democrats haul this year at from six to nine seats , with the potential to topple even GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia if voters move in a great heave on election day to sweep out incumbents in reliably Republican states . <p> Other establishment GOP brands also may be heading for defeat : Elizabeth Dole , wife of former GOP presidential nominee and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole in North Carolina ; and John Sununu , scion of former New Hampshire Gov. and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu . <p> The shock in Senate races is n't that Democrats are winning the Republican West , but that they 're on the verge of taking seats in the South , the GOP 's stronghold since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a race in Mississippi at all ? " marveled Jennifer Duffy , who tracks Senate races for the Cook Political Report . <p> Political oddsmakers say Democrats have all but sewn up Senate seats in Colorado , New Mexico , New Hampshire , Virginia and possibly North Carolina . They have strong shots at taking Oregon and Alaska ; are in toss-ups in Minnesota and Mississippi ; and are making runs at Kentucky and Georgia . <p> The only hope Republicans had of picking up even one seat was Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu 's in Louisiana , and she is coasting with a comfortable lead . <p> " I do n't think Republicans are going to lose in Kentucky or Georgia , but I would n't bet more than a quarter on it the way things are going , " said Larry Sabato , director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia . " It 's going to be a wave election for Democrats . It 's going to be big . " <p> That would be the second wave in a row , a rarity in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Hill . Voters traditionally retrench after a sweep for one party . <p> If Democrats reach a 60-vote majority and take the White House , it would be the first time since 1979 that either party held the presidency and both chambers of Congress with a filibuster-proof Senate . But even that minimizes the historic magnitude because Democratic President Jimmy Carter had so little control over his own party . <p> The better comparison is Johnson in 1965 , Sabato said . Johnson was a former Senate majority leader and president who exercised pre-eminent power , enacting landmark civil rights , immigration and health care legislation known as the Great Society . <p> Democrats are riding almost cosmic political forces : President Bush 's deep unpopularity , a weak economy , a banking panic with a $700 billion rescue a month before the election , Republican presidential nominee John McCain 's badly managed campaign and Democrat Barack Obama 's well-run one , a string of GOP retirements , the corruption trial of Alaska GOP icon Ted Stevens , and a strong third-party candidacy in Minnesota that could split the GOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " When 91 percent of people say the country is seriously off on the wrong track , an all-time record , " Sabato said , " and the president is at 23 percent approval , 3 percent below President Richard Nixon the day he resigned , it 's just a question of how many seats the Democrats pick up . " <p> The GOP Senate campaign committee is campaigning to " Save the Filibuster . " Just three years ago , Republicans were so confident of their majority that they threatened to use what they called the " nuclear option " to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominees . <p> " Liberals are bent on handing Barack Obama a filibuster-proof Senate majority to rubber-stamp his radical agenda , " Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , vice chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee pleaded to donors . <p> Democrats are skewering Republicans who voted for the bank bailout , despite Obama 's strong support for it . That includes McConnell , often attacked as a partisan but who hailed the rescue as one of the Senate 's " finest moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss in Kentucky would be an earthquake , similar in magnitude to the defeat of former Senate Majority Leader and South Dakota Democrat Tom Daschle in 2004 . It 's the kind of year , said Nathan Gonzales , political editor of the Rothenberg Political Report , a nonpartisan newsletter , where " normally safe incumbents start to become vulnerable . " <p> Still , there are potential complications for Democrats even if they reach a 60-vote majority or close enough to lure enough moderate Republicans on some issues to get to 60 . <p> Democrats depend for their current majority on two independents , Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont . Sanders is reliably Democratic , but Lieberman , a former Democratic vice presidential nominee who broke with his party on Iraq and was shunned in his 2006 re-election primary bid , is campaigning for McCain . There is no love lost between him and Democrats . <p> Moreover , several potential new Democrats would come at the expense of moderate Republicans , such as Gordon Smith of Oregon and Minnesota 's Norm Coleman . More troublesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prone to break ranks . These include the conservative Ronnie Musgrove in Mississippi , Virginia 's Mark Warner , campaigning as a moderate , and Kay Hagan , who could topple Dole in North Carolina . <p> " I do n't think they can count on Warner 's vote 100 percent of the time , " said Duffy . " Hagan ought to be careful about what she does and how she votes . " Thirty-five seats are up for election , including midterm vacancies in Wyoming and Mississippi . The current Senate breakdown is 49 Democrats , 49 Republicans and two independents . Republicans are defending 23 seats to the Democrats 12 , including five GOP retirements . The Democrats dream is to pick up nine seats to give them a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority . The last time either party gained nine seats was in the 1994 GOP landslide , when Republicans recaptured the House for the first time in 40 years and retook the Senate . Incumbent Republican Ted Stevens versus Democrat Mark Begich . Stevens , 84 , finished testifying in his own corruption trial two weeks before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal court in Washington , D.C. , to hit the campaign trail . Stevens has miraculously narrowed Begich 's 17-point lead to a dead heat by stressing his ability to bring home the bacon . Beginning his long tenure in the Senate in 1968 and known in Alaska as " Uncle Ted , " some think Stevens could win if he is acquitted or even if the verdict is mixed the prosecution bungled and the judge threw out some evidence . Despite his frosty relationship with Gov . Sarah Palin , the GOP vice presidential nominee , Stevens could ride her coattails in this solidly GOP state . Open seat vacated by retiring Republican Wayne Allard . Democrat Rep. Mark Udall has a big lead over former GOP Rep. Bob Schaffer , a conservative from the eastern part of a state at the crumbling edge of the GOP 's long lock on the West . Democrats won a Senate seat here in 2004 and the governorship in 2006 . GOP presidential nominee John McCain is beginning to cut back advertising here . Incumbent Republican Saxby Chambliss versus challenger former state Rep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a shocker , signaling a Democratic landslide . Even Democratic pollsters say Democrats have " no business " winning here . Yet Chambliss is being hurt by his vote for the $700 billion bailout , and Martin is getting a heavy assist from his party . Chambliss has seen his 20-point lead in September dwindle to two . Incumbent Republican Mitch McConnell , challenger Democrat Bruce Lunsford . Former President Bill Clinton won this red state twice , but Obama does n't have a chance here , which makes McConnell 's slippage all the more surprising . McConnell , seeking his fifth term , is the Senate Republican leader but finds himself in a tough fight . Lunsford is a wealthy businessman whose nursing home business was beset by controversies , and he failed at earlier statewide bids for governor . Yet the latest polls put the race at a tie . Incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu , challenger Republican John Kennedy . The only place Republicans hope for a pickup , but Landrieu has a comfortable lead . Incumbent Republican Norm Coleman , challenged by Democrat Al Franken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedian embarrassed for failing to file tax returns . He lacked traction from the outset . But Coleman , a comparatively popular moderate , is also a first-termer who barely won his last race as a Republican in a deep blue state in a very bad year for Republicans . Fact is , neither major-party candidate will win with more than 40 percent of the vote because Barkley is polling in the high teens , boosted by an endorsement from former professional wrestler and Gov . Jesse Ventura . Lots of mudslinging in this race . Former GOP Gov . Arne Carlson endorsed Obama , and Coleman asked the McCain campaign to stop its robo calls in the state . Open seat vacated when Republican Trent Lott retired last year . Republican Roger Wicker was appointed to Lott 's seat ; his challenger is Democrat Ronnie Musgrove . Obama is unlikely to win Mississippi , but with a voting-age population that is 33 percent African American , the nation 's highest , his coattails are giving a big boost to Musgrove , a very conservative Democrat . Incumbent Republican John Sununu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaheen has been leading for months and few think Sununu can close the gap in a state shifting Democratic . Sununu , the Senate 's youngest senator , is not being written off yet , because he beat Shaheen to win his seat . But McCain is equally behind despite nonstop campaigning . Democrats have had their eye on this one all year . Open seat vacated by retiring Republican Pete Domenici . Republican Steve Pearce and Democrat Tom Udall squaring off , and it 's not even a contest . Udall has a crushing 20-point lead , and it looks like he could join his cousin , Mark Udall , in the Senate . Incumbent Republican Elizabeth Dole , challenger Democrat Kay Hagan . Some analysts say insider polling shows first-termer Dole is toast . Wife of former Senate Majority Leader and presidential nominee Bob Dole , Dole lives in Washington and has come under attack for being out of touch with Tarheels . The national Democratic committee is throwing money at the race ; Democratic registration gains are phenomenal , adding 300,000 new voters to Republicans 64,000 ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over John Kerry 's showing in 2004 . All signs are of a wave washing out Dole . Incumbent Republican Gordon Smith , challenger Democrat Jeff Merkley . Smith , a moderate and wealthy frozen-vegetable magnate , has broken sharply with President Bush on Iraq , the environment and gay rights , and runs ads tying himself to Obama . But in a nationalized election where such distinctions do n't seem to count , Merkley , the state House speaker , was beaten up in a tough Democratic primary and polls have had the two tied at times , but everything is moving in Democrats favor here . Open seat vacated by retiring Republican John Warner . Republican former Gov . Jim Gilmore faces former Democratic Gov . Mark Warner . The moderate Warner is a shoo-in . This former Confederate capital will soon have two Democratic senators and could help put Obama in the presidency , the way trends are moving . <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
