This law is true // for soil , plant , animal and man : the health of these four is one // connected chain . Any weakness or defect in the health of any // earlier link in the chain is carried on to the next and succeeding // links , until it reaches the last , namely , man . // //  --  Sir Albert Howard , &shy; 1945 // // In 1998 , Chensheng Lu , a researcher at the Department of Health at the University of Washington , began testing children in the Seattle area to see whether he could detect pesticide residues in their urine . He was looking for signs of organophosphates , a class of chemicals closely related to nerve agents developed during World War II , which subsequently came into widespread use as pesticides in a far less potent form , eventually accounting for half of all insecticide use in the United States . The chemicals inactivate enzymes crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough levels of exposure , can lead to symptoms as various as mild anxiety or respiratory paralysis . Long &shy; - &shy; term exposure increases the risk of neurobehavioral damage , cancer , and reproductive &shy; disorders . // // Lu and his colleagues thought that children living near farms would have the highest levels of pesticide residues , since they were subject to drift from nearby fields . But the 110 two &shy; - to five &shy; - &shy; year &shy; - &shy; olds he studied in the Seattle metropolitan area turned out to have higher levels of pesticide metabolites ( the markers produced when the body metabolizes the chemicals ) . This suggested that food residues or home pesticide use , not drift , were the primary path for &shy; exposure . // // The study also had a curious anomaly : One child out of the hundreds they had studied had no signs of any pesticide &shy; metabolites . // // " It was kind of surprising , " said Lu , who now directs the Pesticide Exposure and Risk Laboratory at Emory University ? s Rollins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewed the parents , they learned the family ate organic food almost &shy; exclusively . // This provided the first hint of scientific evidence that an organic food diet reduced pesticide exposure in children . Another study looked at pesticide residue data from 94,000 food samples from 1994-1999 and found organic food had about two &shy; - &shy; thirds less residues than conventional food . This showed that organic consumers were getting what they paid for  --  lower pesticides in food  --  but the study looked only at what was in the overall food supply , not what people ate . By identifying metabolites in the urine  --  through a technique known as biomonitoring  --  the &shy; researchers had evidence of pesticides children had actually &shy; consumed . // // Cynthia Curl , another scientist then at the University of Washington , followed up on Lu ? s finding and published the results in March 2003 . She showed that a group of children who ate mostly organic food had one &shy; - &shy; sixth the pesticide metabolites of those who ate nonorganic food , but the study could not identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ones produced the same markers . The study only concluded that eating organic food reduced the children ? s risk of exposure to harmful pesticides from an " uncertain " level to a " negligible " &shy; one . // // Lu , with funding from the Environmental Protection Agency , has since buttressed this conclusion . When a research team he led substituted organic foods for a conventional diet in children for five days , they could find no evidence of pesticide metabolites in their urine . When they reintroduced conventional foods , the metabolites returned . The paper concluded that an organic food diet provided " a protective mechanism " against pesticide exposure in a manner that " is dramatic and &shy; immediate . " // // Although the potential risks incurred by pesticide exposures over a lifetime are unknown , people who choose to eat organic for this reason have , in effect , decided to opt out of an ongoing social experiment into whether pesticides are safe . Given the number of pesticides that were once freely used but have since been removed from the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreasonable choice . For children the reasoning seems even &shy; clearer . // // Chemicals are up to ten times more toxic in the developing bodies of infants and children than in adults , according to a 1993 report by the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) , a nonpartisan , government &shy; - &shy; funded research body . At ages one to five , children also eat three to four times more food per pound of body weight than adults , and their diet is far more concentrated ( infants consume seventeen times more apple juice than the U.S. average , for example ) . So not only are children subject to a higher dose of pesticides , but the chemicals also have a greater impact on their bodies . That conclusion , reached in the NAS study , led to an overhaul of U.S. pesticide laws in 1996 , charging the EPA to consider the impact of pesticides on children , a reevaluation process that is still going &shy; on . // // " If you can reduce some risk from some usage or pathway , you actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it just so happens , for kids , the majority of exposure comes from dietary intake . So the benefit can be quite &shy; overwhelming . " // // The curious thing about this conclusion was that the people who were buying organic food  --  largely women , who make most household purchasing decisions , and especially mothers  --  already assumed it was true . It was common sense . If you ate food from organic farms that shunned toxic pesticides , less residue would end up in your body . You might not know what substance you were avoiding , or what the actual risk was , but that didn ? t really matter . Why consume pesticides at all if they added no nutritional value and might be detrimental to health ? And why not support a farmer who had figured out how to produce food without them ? This wasn ? t a giant leap of faith but a conclusion consumers could easily reach , even if it required them to pay more for &shy; food . // // amily : ' Times New Roman ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed on consumer unease with the conventional food system . This became apparent in 1989 , when CBS ? s 60 Minutes aired a report about Alar , a pesticide that the government kept on the market even though it was a probable human carcinogen . Sprayed on apples , the pesticide was converted into a potential carcinogen when apples were heat &shy; - &shy; processed into juice and applesauce , products largely consumed by children . In the spotlight , the EPA banned the substance , saying that " long &shy; - &shy; term exposure to Alar poses unacceptable risks to public health . " The entire episode created , as Newsweek put it , " A Panic For Organic , " which was a mixed blessing for the young industry , since stores soon faced shortages of organic food and fraudulent items appeared , leading Congress to pass national organic food regulations in &shy; 1990. // // More recent scares , surrounding meat , have had a similar effect , notably in Europe . Mad cow disease ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) arose in 1986 , it is believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once routinely fed to livestock . By the mid &shy; - &shy; nineties , the British government acknowledged that people who had eaten the meat of infected animals were dying from a new variant of Creutzfeldt &shy; - &shy; Jakob disease , which began with depression or anxiety and progressed to a crippling of the brain and death . More than 150 people died and cattle herds across Europe had to be destroyed . In late 2003 , the first case of mad cow appeared in the United States , several years after cattle feed rules were revamped . No human deaths were attributed to the disease , nor did meat sales suffer , but organic meat sales jumped 78 percent . While the risk of tainted meat may be infinitesimally small , that didn ? t really address the main fear . Why had the conventional food industry taken these risks , anyway , when the natural diet of cattle was grass , not other &shy; animals ? // // Yet while a third of American women and a quarter of all men believe that pesticides , hormones , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to health , the growth of the organic food industry can not be entirely attributed to food scares , which make headlines and then fade away . Nor can its rise be explained by fears about pesticides , although they , too , play a central role . Buying and consuming organic food has come to be viewed not only as a means of avoiding harm but as a benefit in itself , a personal way of aligning nutrition , health , and social and environmental well &shy; - &shy; being . A mother might buy organic apple juice for her child because she views it as healthier ; a twenty &shy; - &shy; something single making a meal with friends might choose organic lettuce mix because she thinks it ? s better for the environment ; a couple planning to celebrate a special occasion with a fancy dinner at a restaurant might seek a chef who relies upon organic food grown by small farmers and harvested at its peak . Where food comes from , who grows and processes it , and what happens to people and the environment along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Consumers don ? t just taste food , they experience it , and knowing a product came from a food system that treats farmers well may well enhance its flavor , " researchers at Tufts University in Boston &shy; write . // // While critics often portray organic farming as a pre &shy; - &shy; industrial anachronism practiced by aging hippies , romantics , Luddites , and quacks who are incapable of feeding the world , this characterization never seems to get very far with consumers because it misses the central premise . Organic food exists because , like any industry , it fulfills a need , in this case arising from lapses in the perceived quality and safety of conventional food production , and from the desire for an alternative predicated upon personal and environmental health . This demand has not been manufactured ( nor could it be  --  total U.S. sales of organic food in 2003 amounted to only a third of the $29 billion that conventional food firms shelled out for advertising that year ) .
