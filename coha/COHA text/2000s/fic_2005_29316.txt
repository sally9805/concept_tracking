At the beginning it was a bit of fun . Kris Ironside and I , both single , both thirty-one , both meteorologists employed to interpret the invisible swings and buffets of global air for television and radio audience consumption , both of us found without excitement that some of the vacation weeks allotted to us overlapped . We both worked in the Weather Center of the British Broadcasting Corporation , taking it in turns with several other forecasters to deliver the good or bad weather news to the nation . From breakfast to midnight our voices sounded familiar and our faces smiled or frowned into millions of homes until we could go nowhere at all without recognition . Kris rather enjoyed it , and so had I once , but I had long gone beyond any depth of gratification and sometimes found the instant identification a positive drawback . " Are n't you ... ? " " Yes , I guess so . " I used to go for vacations to lands that did n't know me . A week in Greece . Elephants in the Serengeti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No grand or gasp-worthy dangers . I lived an ordered life . Kris stabbed with his thumb the roster pinned to the department notice board . Disgust shook his hand . " October and November ! " he grumbled . " And I asked for August . " It was January at the time : August tended to be given to those with school-age children . Kris 's chances of August had always realistically been zero , but with Kris hope often outweighed commonsense . It was his streak of wild unpredictabilitythe manic side of his characterthat made him a good evening pub companion , but a week in his company once in the foothills of the Himalayas had left me glad to return to home soil . My own name , Perry Stuart , appeared alphabetically near the bottom of the list , ahead only of Williams and Yates . In late October , I saw , I could take the ten working days still owing to me by then and return to the screen on the eve of Fireworks Night , November 5th . I shrugged and sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supposed , honored to deal with the rain-or-no-rain million-dollar gamble on fine weather for the night the skies blazed with the multicolored firework starbursts sent up in memory of Guy Fawkes and his blow-up-Parliament gunpowder plot . Year after year if I got downpours right I winced over sackloads of letters from reproachful children who reckoned their disappointment to be my fault . Kris followed my gaze down the list and tapped my name with his finger . " October and November , " he pronounced without surprise . " Do n't tell me ! You 'll waste half of that leave on your grandmother again . " " I expect so . " He protested , " But you see her every week . " " Mm . " Where Kris had parents , brothers and a coven of cousins , I had a grandmother . She had literally plucked me as an infant out of the ruins of a gas-exploded house , and had dried her grief for my dead parents in order to bring me up . Where batches of my meteorological colleagues had wives , husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was n't unmarried by design : more by lack of urgency or the advent of Cinderella . As autumn approached the Ironside manic-depressive gloom intensified downwards . Kris 's latest girlfriend left him , and the Norwegian pessimism he 'd inherited from his mother , along with his pale skin , lengthy jaw and ectomorph physique , was leading him to predict cyclones more often than usual at the drop of a single millibar . Small groups of the great wide public with special needs tended to gravitate to particular forecasters . One associate , Beryl Yates , had cornered weddings , for instance , and Sonny Rae spent his spare time advising builders and house painters , and pompous old George told local councils when they might dryly dig up their water mains . Landowners , great and small , felt comfortable with Kris , and would cut their hay to the half hour on his say-so . As Kris 's main compulsive personal hobby was flying his own light aircraft , he spent many of his free days lunching with far-flung but welcoming farmers . They cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had been known to pollard a row of willows to provide a safe low-trajectory takeoff . I had flown with him three times on these farming jaunts , though my own bunch of followers , apart from children with garden birthday parties , had proved to be involved with horses . I seemed particularly to be consulted by racehorse trainers seeking perfect underfoot conditions for their speedy hopefuls , even though we did run forecasts dedicated to particular events . By voice transfer on a message machine a trainer might say , " I 've a fancied runner at Windsor on Wednesday evening , what are the chances of firm ground ? " or " I 'm not declaring my three-mile chaser to run tomorrow unless you swear it 'll rain overnight . " They might be pony club camp organizers or horse show promoters , or even polo entrepreneurs , begging for the promise of sunshine . They might be shippers of brood mares to Ireland anxious for a calm sea crossing , and they might above all be racecourse managers wanting advice on whether or not to water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prospect of good going encouraged trainers to send their horses . The prospect of many runners encouraged spectators to arrive in crowds . " Good going " was gold dust to the racing industry ; and woe betide the forecaster who misread the clouds . But no weatherman , however profound his knowledge or intuition , could guess the skies right all the time , and , as over the British Isles especially the fickle winds could change direction without giving notice , to be accurate eighty-five percent of the time was miraculous . Kris 's early autumnal depression intensified day by day and it was from some vague impulse to cheer him up that I agreed to his suggestion of a Sunday lunch flight to Newmarket . Our host , Kris assured me , would be catering for at least twenty guests , so my presence would hardly overload the arrangements . " And besides , " Kris added with mild routine sarcasm , " your face is your fortune , you ca n't get away from it . Caspar will slobber all over you . " " Caspar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh . " Caspar Harvey might be one of Kris 's wealthiest farming cronies , but he also owned three or four racehorses whose trainer twittered in nervous sound bites in my ears from Monday to Sunday . Oliver Quigley , the trainer , temperamentally unsuited to any stressful way of life , let alone the nerve-breaking day-to-day of the thoroughbred circuit , was , on his messages system , audibly in awe of Caspar Harvey , which was hardly the best basis for an owner-trainer relationship . I had met neither man face to face and did n't much want to , but as the day of the lunch approached I kept coming across references to " that gift to racing , Caspar Harvey " or " Caspar Harvey in final dash to honors on the winning owners ' list " or " Caspar Harvey pays millions at the Yearling Sales for Derby hopes " : and as my knowledge and curiosity grew , so did my understanding of the Quigley jitters . The week before the Caspar Harvey lunch was one of those times when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each evening , daily working out the probable path of air masses and going in front of the cameras at peak times to put my assessments on the line . Many people used to think that all Kris and I and other forecasters did was to read out from someone else 's script : there was often surprise when we explained that we were in actual fact forecasters , that it was we who predicted the weather ourselves , using the information gathered from distant weather stations and having discussed it with colleagues . We then went " live " and unscriptedand usually aloneinto a very small studio where we ourselves placed the computerized weather symbols on the background screen map of Britain . There were well over two hundred weather stations covering the British Isles , each reporting local wind speeds and direction and barometric pressure into a large central computer housed in the main Meteorological Office in Bracknell , near Ascot , west of London . Into that computer too came data from all over the world : and one could draw from it everything the world 's weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But nothing was ever certain , and a lurch of high atmosphere pressure could let in a polar gust that would refrigerate our cheerful expectations into unconvincing explanations . The late September Sunday of Caspar Harvey 's lunch , though , dawned fine and clear with a chilly wind from the east , conditions that would remain that way all day while the farmers of East Anglia harvested their late-ripening barley . " Perfect for flying " Kris said . Kris 's airplane , a low-winged single-engined Piper Cherokee , was approximately thirty years old . He , he frankly acknowledged , was its fourth owner , the third being a flying club that had sometimes put six hours a day on the propeller log ( Kris 's only gripe ) and rubbed old-age patches into the cracked leather seats . My first reaction to the antique rig a couple of years earlier had been " No thanks , I 'll stay on the ground , " but Kris had introduced me in his home airfield 's echoing hangar to a machinist who understood the relationship between loose screws and sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on the machinist 's assurance that old though the Piper might be , it was airworthy to the last rivet . Kris , in fact , had turned out to be a surprisingly competent pilot . I 'd expected him to be as volatile in the air as in his general behavior but instead he was soberly responsible at the controls and only as high as a radiosonde balloon afterwards . Many of our colleagues found Kris a difficult companion and asked me in mild exasperation how I dealt with his obvious leaning towards my company . I usually answered truthfully that I enjoyed his slightly weird views on life , and I did n't mention that in his depressive periods he talked familiarly about suicide as if discussing an unimportant life choice like what tie to wear for early breakfast broadcasts . It was regard for his parents , and for his father in particular , that deterred him from the final jump into the path of a train ( his preferred method of exit ) , and I reckoned that he had less self-hatred and more courageous staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish . At the time of Caspar Harvey 's lunch party , Kris Ironside at thirty-one had outlasted the macabre instincts of a succession of young women who had temporarily found the idea of suicide fascinating , and was beginning to face the possibility that he might yet make it to middle age . In appearance , apart from the overall tall and willowy build , he was noticeably good-looking , with pale blue intelligent eyes , wiry blond stick-out hair that refused help from barbers , a strong blond mustache , and , on screen particularly , a sort of half-grin that dared you not to believe his every word . He kept his flying pride and joy on White Waltham airfield and to its upkeep devoted the bulk of his income , gleefully informing anyone who would listen that it left aerobic exercises out of sight as a keep-fit heart-stresser . He greeted me at White Waltham with what I knew from experience to be supercharged happiness . His Cherokee , parked by the petrol pumps , was taking aboard fuel that was no more stable than himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water formed there by hot saturated air condensing as the aircraft cooled after last time out . Kris , never one of the old **28;444;TOOLONG variety of pilots , was wearing a plaid heavy wool shirt with a Norwegian-knit sweater on top . He eyed my dark pants , white shirt and navy jacket and nodded approval : in some way he considered my all-too-conventional appearance to be a license for his own eccentricity to flourish . He finished the refueling , checked that the two wing tank caps were screwed on tight and then , having with my help pushed the little white airplane a short distance from the pumps ( a small courtesy to other refuelers ) , he methodically walked round the whole machine , intoning his checklist to himself as he touched each vital part . As usual , he finished by unclipping and opening backwards each half of the engine cowling , checking that the mechanic had n't left a rag in the works ( as if he would ! ) and also wiping the dipstick clean before re-inserting it down into the sump , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to lubricate the engine . Kris had never been one to take foolish chances when it came to flying . Once aboard and sitting in the left-hand ( captain 's ) seat he equally seriously completed his pre-starting checksall switches in good order , and things like thatand finally started the engine , gazing concentratedly at its gauges . Used to his meticulous ways , I sat placidly waiting for satisfaction to relax the tension in his backbone and hands , until at last he grunted , switched on his radio , and informed the Sunday controller up in his glass tower that Ironside in his Cherokee required takeoff clearance for a simple flight to Newmarket , return expected at about seventeen hundred hours local time . Kris and the controller knew each other well ; the exchange of information was a courtesy , more than an obligation . Cleared to taxi , allowed the tower . " Thanks , kiddo , " the pilot said . Kris was right , it was a lovely day for flying . The Cherokee lifted off lightheartedly with its easy load and swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The noise of the engine in a cross between a growl and clatter made casual conversation difficult , but talking anyway was ever superfluous up there higher than eagles . Pleasure as always sat like a balloon in my mind , and I checked our progress against the map on my knees with unalloyed contentment . Maybe one of these days ... why did n't I ... learn to fly ? Kris had drawn two straight lines on the wipe-clean surface of the air map , a dog-leg route to lunch . It was he who steered by the direction indicator , allowing for magnetic variation and a crosswind , and I with small triumphs who checked our passage over the roads and rivers two thousand feet below and pointed them out to him , earning grins and nods . From White Waltham we flew north to avoid crossing straight over London , turning northeast where the north-heading multi-lane M1 highway reached the outskirts of the sprawling town of Luton , with its busy airport to the east . Kris yearned for some of the expensive avionic packages that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air navigation easier . It cost him every spare cent , however , just to keep flying , so he navigated by dead reckoning and sharp-eyed passengers , and only once , he said , had he been disastrously lost . Dead reckoning delivered us safely alive into the Newmarket area , where he sought out a large house some way south of the town and , descending to a thousand feet or so , circled round it twice , causing figures below to appear waving in the garden . " Caspar Harvey 's house , " Kris shouted unnecessarily . I nodded O.K. ; and as he was circling clockwise , with the wing on my side low to give me a good view , I brought out the handy little camera I carried with me always and took enough shots , I reckoned , to thank and please our host . Kris , breaking off from the circling , ascended again a few hundred more feet and gave me a Cherokee-eye view of the purpose-built town that the racing world called " Headquarters . " I 'd talked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trainers who worked there . I 'd corresponded with e-mail by the electronic ton . I knew voices and I knew characters , and it was n't only Oliver Quigley whose sharp anxieties begged assurances from me that I could n't give . Neither Kris nor I , as I 'd checked with him before the flight , knew which of the many stableyards in Newmarket were identifiable from the air , and once over the place and thundering along at a hundred and twenty knots , I found I was sure only of one or two of the biggest . Oliver Quigley had told me often that his string could trot straight from his yard onto Warren Hill , but with the speed and the sunshine and my ground-to-air ignorance of the town 's geography , I was n't at all sure in which quadrangle stableyard stood Caspar Harvey 's equine investments , not to mention a filly due to run on Friday . To be on the safe side of pleasing the trainer , therefore , I snapped as many stableyards as I could . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-marked gallops nor in the stableyards nor on the horse walks ( special paths for horses ) which laced the town . There were upwards of twelve hundred aristocratic thoroughbreds down there somewhere , but at lunchtime on a Sunday they were n't doing much but dreaming . Kris looked at his watch and headed south of the town , where he put the wheels down sweetly on the official grass strip that ran beside the part of the racecourse used in high summerthe July course . The Jockey Club not only allowed this but , to Kris 's indignation , charged a fee . He taxied back fast to where a Land Rover waited with a young woman in an ultra short skirt leaning against it . " Shit , " Kris said forcefully . " Why shit ? " " He 's sent his daughter . He promised she would n't be here " " She looks O.K. to me . " Kris said " Huh " with pity for my ignorance and slowed the Cherokee , and , swinging it round neatly into a tidy configuration for parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kris said . " Poison . " I unclipped my seat belt , unlatched the door , climbed out and jumped down from the wing . Kris , having checked his switches , scrambled after . I was n't sure he meant it about her name but he casually introduced us . " Bell , this is Perry . Perry ... Belladonna . Call her Bell . " I shook her hand . She said , eyebrows lifting , " Are n't you ... ? " " I expect so , " I said . She looked sugar-sweet , not deadly . Fair hair , more wispy than regulated . Blue eyes with innocuously blinking lids . Pink-outlined lips with a smile that never quite left them . Even without Kris 's comment , I 'd have been aware of witchcraft . " Climb in , " she invited , gesturing to the Land Rover . " Dad heard you circling overhead and sent me along . He 's mulling wine . He 'd never leave with cinnamon floating . " Kris , apparently deaf to the instruction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening to the small cracking noises of the metal cooling . Its white painted fuselage gleamed in the sun along with the dark blue personalized insignia of a lightning flash and the registration letters that identified Kris worldwide : and in fact he had flown in enough countries to be known ( not without respect ) as the " the fussy English . " After his final landing on wet days he sponged and dried the undersides of the wings , not just the tops , to get rid of any mud thrown up by the wheels . " Get in , do , " Bell told him , opening the Land Rover 's front passenger door for him . " This party 's today , not tomorrow . " The antagonism between them was faint but positive . I sat in the rear seat for the five-mile drive to Caspar Harvey 's house listening to the semi-polite exchanges and wondering how far their mutual dislike would go , such as , would they save each other if it risked themselves . Caspar Harvey 's home proved to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of ostentatious . The front , with small-scale Palladian pillars , seemed imposing , but the inside was only one room deep , and no one had tried to pretend otherwise . Entrance hall and sitting room , combined by a wall of arches , made a single space ample enough for the gathering of upwards of thirty people who stood around drinking hot red wine , eating handfuls of peanuts and talking about Newmarket 's main profitable cropracehorses . Caspar Harvey , noticing Kris 's arrival , eeled his way , drink held high , until he could greet his guest within shouting distance in the throng . " I heard your overhead pass . " He nodded to Kris . " And welcome to you , too , " he added in my direction . " My trainer swears by your nose for rain . He 's here somewhere . Do I run my filly on Friday ? My wife puts her faith in the stars . Have some wine . " I accepted the wine , which tasted melodiously of cinnamon and sugar , and followed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quigley , a-quiver and visibly ill at ease . " Tell him it will be dry until Friday , " Harvey said . " Tell him to run my horse . " He was enjoying , I thought , his role of lavish host . Reprehensible of me to think also that the role itself meant more to him than his guests . His expansive gestures were like his setting : a conscious indication of wealth and achievement , but one that carefully fell short of a flourish of trumpets . I told him I 'd taken aerial photos of his house and would send them to him , and , pleased , he invited me to take as many shots of his guests as they would allow . In body he was as substantial as in means , a heavy-shouldered presence with a thick neck and a trim gray grizzled beard . Shorter by only three inches than Kris 's willowy extentas I was myselfCaspar Harvey would nevertheless have been noticeable at any height , or lack of it : he had , strongly developed , the indefinable aura that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posed again , and nodded benignly at the flash . Kris drank Coca-Cola as a good little pilot should and kept his manic extravagance within bounds . It was definitely an " up " day in his psyche ; good for wit and laughter and with no question of despairing walks along railway tracks . The non-poisonous Belladonna , appearing at my side and pouring from a steaming jug of replenishment , asked me baldly why a sensible-looking person like myself should bother with Ironside 's mental switchback . " He 's clever , " I said neutrally . " Is that enough ? " " Why do n't you like him ? " I asked . " Like him ? I loved the bastard once . " She gave me a twitch of a deeper smile and a shrug of shoulders and poured reinforcements for others and I , as one does at such events , in time fetched up in a chatting bunch that contained the ever-worried trainer , Oliver Quigley . What about this wind , he wanted to know . " It 's cold , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset him . I was used to aggression and disbelief from the sort of horse-oriented people who seemed to think ( like children ) that bad weather was somehow my fault . I was accustomed to being the unpopular messenger who brought the bad news of battles lost , and I 'd been often enough cursed for smiling while I forecast blizzards ; but on the whole I 'd not caused what looked unexpectedly like fear . I must be misreading him , I thought . But then , I knew him only as an agitated weather-obsessed horse trainer , and he could havewho knewall sorts of other problems . " It depends on the Urals , " I said soothingly . He was mystified . " What does ? " " The wind from the east . It 's early in the year for a polar continental blast like this , but there may be a clear dry day for Caspar Harvey 's filly , if it goes on blowing until Friday . " " And will it ? " The question was put slightly pugnaciously by a gray-haired fiftyish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of pearls and an apologetic husband . " Evelyn dear ... " he murmured patiently . She persevered with questions . " And what do you mean by Urals ? " Her husband , a small round man in heavy dark eyeglass frames , answered her smoothly . " Evelyn , dear , the Urals are mountains in Russia . On a straight line from the Urals to London , there is no high ground to get in the way . Nothing to divert or deflect an east wind from Siberia . " He assessed me with shrewd but amiable brown eyes behind the heavy-duty lenses . He said , " Are n't you the young man who flew here with the meteorologist ? " Before I could agree that yes , I was , Oliver Quigley told him with rapid emphasis and energetic hands that I too forecast the weather and was probably even better known to the television public than Kris himself . " Robin and Evelyn , " he assured me , anxious to be understood , " are American of course , and , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British TV . " " Darcy , " said the small man , completing the introduction by shifting his wine glass carefully to his left hand and offering me the right , " Robin Darcy . " He made lunch-party small talk in a subdued Boston-type accent . " And will you be along with Kris Ironside on his vacation ? " Not that I knew of . " I do n't think so , " I replied . Robin , I thought , had just inquired very delicately about my sexual preference . And what , I wondered , was his own ? Evelyn , matronly in black and seemingly older than her husband , was nobody 's idea of a trophy bimbo . " Be sure to look us up , " she said automatically , but insincerely . " Love to . " I sounded falsely eager , as one does . Her husband rocked a little on heels and toes , his wrists folded over each other low on his stomach . His interest in me , slight in the first place , was fading rapidly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of more responsive brains . Belladonna reappeared with her jug , her gaze ahead on the Darcys . " If you like cleverness , he 's your man . " " He 's clever at what ? " Bell 's pale eyelids fluttered . " It 's like beauty . Born in him . He just is . " Darcy wandered around , however , looking insignificant and unimpressive . Evelyn 's socializing voice was the one that prevailed . " Do n't be fooled , " Bell said . " No . " " Kris said you saved his life a couple of times . " After a pause , I said , " He liked to play with trains . " " No longer ? " " Less and less . " " I would n't fly with him , " she said . " So we quarreled . " After a silence she added , " It finished us . Does n't he scare you ? " There had been a time only a year ago when the trains had all but won ; when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fetus and moaned with pain : when the only word he 'd said , in a sort of anguish , had been " Poison . " A couple of paces away Kris was at the top of his upswing , telling a flying joke and raising eye-crinkling laughter . " So the air hostess said , Yes , Miss Steinem , of course you can go up to the cockpit during this flight and talk to our lady captain and our lady first officer , but there 's just one thing , with our all-female flight crew we do n't call it a cockpit any more ... ' " " God , " Bell groaned . " I told him that bit of feminism yonks ago . " " Good jokes never die . " " Did you know that sometimes he writes verses ? " " Mm . " I paused . " Scientific , mostly . " " I 've seen him tear them up , " Bell said . So had I. A form of suicide , I 'd thought : but better to kill a poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said there was food in the dining room . There were also white-clothed tables and caterers ' gold chairs and an autumnal buffet suitable for millionaires and hungry weathermen . I collected a disgracefully full plate and was welcomed by an insistent Evelyn Darcy into a space on a round table where her husband and four other guests were munching roast grouse with concentration . The four unknowns and I went through the usual recognition routine and a promise that it would n't rain before bedtime ; and I smiled and answered them placidly because in fact I liked my job very much , and good public relations never hurt .
