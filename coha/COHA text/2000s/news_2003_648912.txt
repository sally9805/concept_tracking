<p> By the time Sunday 's game ground to its merciful end , a few thousand fans littered Giants Stadium , seemingly frozen in their seats for the final quarter in the grim chill of the day . They mustered one last wave of boos as the Giants trudged toward their locker room , a place that would provide no safe harbor . <p> There was no escaping the reality of a 27-7 loss to the Atlanta Falcons , a team widely regarded as the worst in the league through its seven-game losing streak . <p> Against the Falcons ' league-worst defense , against a second-string secondary playing in place of a set of benched starters , the Giants scored once . <p> Against an offense manned by a third-string quarterback , a patchwork line and a 180-pound running back , the Giants ' defense was shoved out of the way . <p> Boos were the least of worries for the Giants , who fell to 4-5 . <p> " We came out and played to the level of our opponent , " Giants linebacker Mike Barrow said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . It 's embarrassing . I 'm sick and tired of it . We 've got all this talent , but talent do n't mean anything if you do n't put any demand on it . " <p> All their talent , all their preseason expectations and all their reinflated playoff hopes after clawing back to a 4-4 record did not get them anywhere in this game . The Giants looked nothing like a team fighting for a playoff berth . <p> " That was , " Giants Coach Jim Fassel said , " as poor a performance as I have had a team play . " <p> Fassel did not say much to his team after the game . There was no tirade , just a few to-the-point sentiments . His face nearly glowed red . He told the players he was embarrassed . <p> Through a somber silence , the sound of tape being ripped off equipment cut through the locker room , filled with the lonely echo of water cascading in the shower . <p> Barrow 's words eventually broke the gloom , his deep voice attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how a proud run defense yielded 178 yards to Warrick Dunn , the Falcons ' little weapon in the backfield . But Barrow had to admit there was no explanation . <p> A few yards away , receiver Ike Hilliard struggled to explain the offense 's woes , while he struggled to stand on his injured ankle . There were four turnovers , two of them on interceptions by quarterback Kerry Collins , two on fumbles by tailback Tiki Barber . There was no explanation for those , either . Hilliard listened to Barrow say , " It 's time to put up or shut up , " for about the fifth time , but Hilliard could only shake his head . <p> " Now we just have to be men about it , " Hilliard said . " You can say whatever you want . You can scream at the top of your lungs . The bottom line is we need to find a way to win . It 's not the greatest of situations by any means , but we 'll be men about it . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading into a crucial division game at Philadelphia next Sunday . The Giants are tied with the Redskins for last place in the N.F.C. East . They are 1-4 at home . <p> This was supposed to be their easy game , at home against a sinking team in near upheaval . The Falcons ( 2-7 ) had not won since Week 1 . Coach Dan Reeves had benched his entire secondary two weeks ago . Starting at quarterback was the third-stringer Kurt Kittner , who also played behind a line missing two starters lost for the season to injury . Something close to a full-scale rebellion had broken out against Reeves , and the superstar quarterback Michael Vick was wearing a gray parka as he shuffled around the sideline on his slow-healing broken leg . <p> But the team with nothing to lose , did n't . <p> For the Giants , the game started poorly and deteriorated . The Falcons ' first drive became a Dunn highlight show , headlined by a 45-yard touchdown run that included missed tackles by defensive end Kenny Holmes at the line , safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal line . <p> The Falcons managed littleelse in the first half , but the Giants were not going anywhere either , except for one second-quarter drive that ended in a 2-yard touchdown run by running back Dorsey Levens . The Giants ' other scoring opportunities either sputtered behind an offensive line having its worst day of the season or ended in a turnover . Barber fumbled at the Falcons ' 22 in the first quarter . Collins threw an interception in the end zone in the second . <p> " From the very first snap , we played like we were n't ready to play , " Barber said . " It only got worse . " <p> The Giants had a chance to start anew at halftime tied at 7-7 , but the Falcons took their first drive down the field for a touchdown and the Giants went nowhere , thanks largely to two more turnovers : another Collins interception , which set up the Falcons at the Giants ' 8 for another touchdown , and a Barber fumble in Falcons territory in the fourth . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , including myself , " Barber said . " We put ourselves in position to lose . " <p> The Giants ' offense was coming off two huge performances against the Vikings and the Jets , Collins throwing for 300 or more yards each time . The Falcons were coming in with the N.F.L. 's worst defense , which had given up an average of 32.8 points in their seven straight losses . <p> In the face of an unimpressive Falcons pass rush , the Giants ' offensive line melted . It committed six penalties , four of them holding calls , yielded two sacks and allowed numerous hits on Collins . <p> " There is not one thing they did to beat us , " Giants center Chris Bober said . " We beat ourselves . We went out there and lost that game . They took advantage of our turnovers and penalties , and we killed ourselves . " <p> In contrast , the Falcons scored 27 points with Kittner completing only 9 passes for 65 yards . Dunn was their only offense . <p> " Whenever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just do n't think there 's any excuse for that , " Giants defensive end Michael Strahan said . <p> Most dispiriting to Fassel , though , was the fact that the Giants did not play hard on either side of the ball . He said it was the first time he could ever say that after a game . Before , his players had responded when he challenged them . This time , they did not . <p> " It hurts , " he said . <p> The hurt did not stop with him . It rippled through the stands with the chill wind . It flowed through the Giants ' locker room . <p> " This is n't Giants football , " cornerback Will Allen said . " I do n't know what it is . I 'm embarrassed for myself , my coaches , my teammates , the owners . It 's embarrassing . When we come out and perform like this , it 's not just us . When you go out there , you 're fighting for the rest of the guys who ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and you 're letting all those guys down . We need to realize that around here . " <p> A few fans stayed to make sure they did . <p> EXTRA POINTS <p> The Giants had a rash of injuries . Cornerback RALPH BROWN left with a separated right shoulder . Tight end JEREMY SHOCKEY sprained his knee and will have a magnetic resonance imaging test Monday . Receiver TIM CARTER sustained a concussion and tight end MARCELLUS RIVERS took a hit to the throat . Carter and Rivers spent the night in a hospital for observation . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
