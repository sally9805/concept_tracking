Chapter One When I was growing up , Sunday mornings always found me out of bed by eight . The scent and sizzle of bacon and eggs frying on the stove wafted through the house , gently waking my senses first . I would lie there with my eyes closed , absorbing everything that meant Sunday morning to me : warm sheets beneath me , a blanket that I had pulled up to my neck in the middle of the night , Jonathan 's favorite cartoon characters singing along with the white ball as it bounced over the words , and Daddy humming an incomprehensible tune while shaving in the hallway bathroom ( though I never could understand why somebody who rarely saw the church 's interior would get up so early on a Sunday ) . Still , Daddy 's scrambling right along with us was a part of the routine . If nothing else , he would help Jonathan get his tie on right . " Shondra ! " Momma called from the kitchen , " Get a move on ! " I poked my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am , " in that high-pitched " I 'm up " tone . Just one more minute . Then I began to think about my new white socks and my dress or the way Momma had rolled my hair the night before . I reasoned with myself , willing my feet to swing out and meet the cool rush of air on the other side of that bedspread . I made my first stop at the mirror , unfastened one ofthe pink hair rollers , and watched my bangs spring out of the foam . A smile spread across my face at the sight of that spiral curl . I pulled it down until it met my nose . My hair still smelled like Royal Crown grease and the smoke that embedded itself in each shaft during the pressing process . If I 'd held my head perfectly still the night before , I would n't have any burns behind my ears or at my temples . If I 'd jumped at the sound of the hot comb frying what Momma claimed was " only grease , " I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break from cooking breakfast to come in and check on me . She wore a brown fleece robe with pink house shoes , but I had lived the routine enough to know that she already had on her girdle and white stockings underneath . She 'd brushed her hair back , but there was no bun at the nape . Only a few bobby pins to hold the mass down . She would be wearing a hat that covered her entire head this morning . Probably the white one with sequins and feathers all over it . " Turn ' round here . I 'm gon na let your slip down a little more . I believe that hem on your white dress is pretty low . " She stood behind me and adjusted the straps on my slip such that it fell another inch or two . " There you go . Let me see you . " I turned to face her , all smiles . The bags puffed up beneath her eyes as she pushed her cheeks toward a wide smile of her own . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whole wide world . " " Really , Momma ? " I asked . " No doubt about it . God blessed me with a pretty , smart , wonderful little girl . " She planted a soft kiss on my forehead and stood at arm 's length to look at me again . " Wo n't be long before those little boys at church start takin ' a liking to you , you know . " " I do n't like boys . " I wrinkled my nose and bared my teeth . I did n't like it when she teased me about boys . Especially not since I 'd started getting that tickly , peculiar sensation in my stomach every time I saw people kiss on television . She gave me a glance that said , " you-just-wait-and-see . " Then she left my room , half singing and half moaning one of her favorite congregational hymns : " Servin ' the Lord Will Pay Off After While . " I wished that she would come back and do something-anything-in my room . I wanted to smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth in her notes surround me like a tattered family quilt passed down through generations . Worn to threads in some spots , but worth its original weight in gold . " Now may the grace and mercy of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ rest , rule , and abide in us all until we meet again . Let the church sing , Aaaa-men . " Pastor Simmons dismissed the congregation of True Way Church of God in Christ , and a bustle of conversation began . Sisters and Mothers , clad in a colorful array of tailored suits with fancy hats and sparkling jewelry , hugged each other and planted soft , saintly kisses on each other 's cheeks . Mother Frances hugged me and told me what a wonderful job I was doing with the children , as she always did when I saw her . " You keep up the good work , baby . God 's got a blessing for you . " I kissed her soft , wrinkled cheek and replied , " Thank you , Mother Frances . " " How 's your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underground reporting agency my mother used to keep tabs on me at True Way-I was sure of it . " Oh , she 's doing fine . " " Tell her I said hi . " " Yes , ma'am . " The men , what few there were , exchanged handshakes and visual inspections on their way to the vestibule . Younger children , who rarely got the chance to beat on the drums , ran to the drummer 's empty seat to beat out a few loud clashes before the organist shooed them away . The cheerful hum of church folk idly socializing filled the sanctuary but quickly succumbed to Deacon Bradbury 's it's-time-to-go signal of dimming the lights . I grabbed my tote bag filled with pencils , pens , and paper , and rushed over to talk with Sister Charles . I found her just past the swinging doors of the sanctuary at the water fountain . She was bent over , Bible in left hand and the bag from our denomination 's annual women 's convention slung over her right shoulder . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her last gulp . " Hi , Sister Smith . " She wiped the stray drops from her lips and then pulled me into a hearty hug . " How did Alvin do in tutoring tonight ? " " That 's what I came over to tell you-he worked so hard ! I have never seen anyone put so much effort into learning fractions in all of my life , " I laughed . Alvin , who was standing at her side , put his head down and smiled . Sister Charles 's face lit up , her oily , smooth complexion catching every bit of light that bounced off it . I got the feeling that this was the first piece of good news Sister Charles had heard about her Alvin in a long time . " Did he really ? " I placed my left hand on Alvin 's shoulder , animating my words with my right hand . " Alvin , you can do anything you put your mind to . But you can not give up when things get hard . " " I 'm so glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the church . I ca n't afford any of those fancy tutoring centers right now . " Sister Charles shook her head and smacked her lips . " Besides , you all are doing a better job here than anybody who 's ever worked with Alvin . I did n't see Brother Jenkins tonight . Is n't he the one who usually tutors Alvin ? " " Yes , but Brother and Sister Jenkins just had a new baby , so Brother Jenkins has taken some overtime at his job . Looks like it 's going to be just me for now , " I admitted . I curled my lips in and let out a heavy sigh . At the rate the tutoring program at our church was growing , I knew that I would soon be overwhelmed with struggling students . " Well , I 'll see you next time , Alvin . Keep me in your prayers . " " And you do the same . " Sister Charles smiled back . " Have a blessed evening . " I walked out of the church and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps recently added to our church 's parking lot . Those things cost an arm and a leg , I 'd heard , but came with the price of progress . True Way was growing each week as people sought out what older saints called " the old way . " I knew that sanctified path well . I understood the dos and don'ts : do raise your index finger if you need to walk in church ; do n't sit with your legs crossed knee over knee-cross at the ankle . The traditions and idiosyncrasies of the Church of God in Christ , whether founded or flippant , had been instilled in me from childhood . As I walked to my car with my black skirt brushing my ankles , I was ever thankful to have been raised in somebody 's church ; with faith , and love and a quick pinch from an usher for passing notes during the sermon . I noticed Brother Paul Pruitt 's red BMW parked next to my Honda in the lot . I hurried to unarm my car , hoping to get inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would n't have to cross paths . I did n't have anything against Brother Pruitt . He was the " okay " kind . He had a lot going for him-he was active in the church , mentored young boys , had a good job , had a good attitude , held the door open for women , and so on . But he just did n't make my heart go do any flips . Not at all . And although True Way COGIC was filled with single black women , nobody was knocking on his door so far as I knew . Mother Moore , however , believed that Brother Pruitt was " sweet " on me . She 'd pulled me aside a few Sundays ago after church and whispered into my ear with her rickety voice , " I think he 's got his eye on you . " That was all I needed to know . I figured I 'd just steer clear of him until whatever it was that Mother Moore saw brewing in him faded away . I did n't want any ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting any time pursuing me , missing out on his Miss Right . His headlights blinked on and off . Now I 've got to speak . I casually looked back over my shoulder and said good night to Paul as we both opened our car doors . We spoke our last words over the roof of his car . " How did the tutoring go tonight ? " he asked . " It went very well . " I put my foot inside my car . " That 's great ! Keep up the good work ! " Then he nodded , got into his car , closed the door , and started his engine . Mental note : Mother Moore is not the authority on sweets . Coming home that night , I kicked off my low-heeled shoes at the doorstep and dropped my bags on the leopard-print chaise-the finishing touch that made my living room look like something straight out of Africa . Miniature giraffes , elephants , and cheetahs lined the mantel , adding to the overall safari motif in my formal living room . Candles filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should n't burn them in my absence . In the kitchen , I emptied the dishwasher and loaded in my breakfast dishes : a bowl , a cup , and a spoon . It would be a while before the dishwasher filled up again . There was a peaceful silence about my home-except for the swish of my pantyhose as I walked through , picking up things that were haphazardly misplaced during my morning rush out of the house . Everything was just as it was when I left : toiletries strewn across my bathroom counter , the ironing board standing in the hallway , and the windbreaker that I 'd quickly traded for a leather coat upon opening my front door at six a.m. and meeting Jack Frost face to face . It was still early November , but it 's hard to tell the season by a calendar in Texas . I rotated the gold-toned faucets clockwise and felt my tensions ease at the sound of rushing water . I 'd looked forward to this bath all day long . The midweek tutoring followed by regular service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to work late because of some sporting event at the local middle school , where I served as vice principal . But it was well worth the sacrifice . The church kids ' grades were up , their parents were optimistic , church attendance was higher , and more children heard the gospel . Well , some of them did n't have any other choice because they 'd hitched a ride with someone who stayed through service , but that was all right . They were there , and I 'd done my part to bring them to the Word . I inched into the tub , controlling my reaction to the splendid heat that soothed me while stinging me simultaneously . Resting my head on the bathtub pillow , I closed my eyes and began thinking . My birthday was just around the corner . My soul could only look back in wonder at the years that had gone by . So many blessings and so much favor that I could n't even begin to explain . My mind began drifting down the path that only opens up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my right mind . My soul was free . But I was alone . Thirty had come and almost gone without so much as a little poof . Thirty-one was n't far away , which would make me officially in my thirties . Being in my thirties , I 'd reasoned , was different from being thirty . Thirty said that I was still a little wet behind the ears , just getting over the twenties . But in my thirties was different . Somebody in the thirties could be anybody from a newlywed to a grandmother . On the upside of youth or the underside of senior citizenry . Either way , it was time to reevaluate some things ; carefully consider how to expend my time and energy . I was too young to be worried about getting married , yet too old to take for granted that my body would cooperate fully with pregnancy . But me pregnant at my biological peak would have been a nightmare . At my biological child- bearing peak , I 'd been running myself ragged , doing everything from " people pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for love in the most desperate dead-end relationships , abusing my body and my faith in the process . Now , in my thirties and with roots that had grown deeper in the knowledge and wisdom of God , there was a part of me that had begun longing for companionship again . I 'd been blessed with many accomplishments educationally and professionally , but I was quickly falling out of ladder-climbing mode . Rather , I wanted to enjoy the rung I was on-to live the thirties without chasing the forties . I wanted to rest in the fact that God was the head of my life , my constant source . Stepping out of the tub and onto the cream-colored bathroom rug , I caught my reflection in the mirror and took a long look at my body . Is this what in the thirties looks like ? Not bad . My light brown skin was still evenly toned and taut in most places . Breasts and behind still holding up strong . Stomach a little pudgy-nothing serious . Time had done a number on my hips , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body once referred to as a " beanpole . " Next I examined my face . I was truly blessed with clear , healthy skin . I did n't wear makeup in high school or college , but after taking a professional job I decided to start wearing foundation , mascara , and lipstick . Every once in a while I did something with my eyes , but it never amounted to much behind the lenses of my glasses . I got closer to the mirror , running my hands along my cheeks . That thirty-something face belonged to a single , African-American Christian woman . My eyebrows were perfectly arched , and all other facial hair had been removed . My thick lips took on a life of their own with their natural outline and plump staging . I studied the outline of my face : high cheekbones , dimples , clearly defined chin , and slightly widened nose . It all played together pretty well , if I may say so myself . After getting into my nightclothes , I walked down the center hall of my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet . Continues ...
