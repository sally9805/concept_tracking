The meeting took place in an ancient grove of oak . They sat among the gnarled roots of a great tree and laid their plans . The future was unknown to them , but they were certain of one thing : Their alliance was strong , their bond unbreakable .  --  Hollow Planet : Destiny 's Sword I am drawing a picture of Sari Aaronsohn . Sari is my best friend . But drawing her is harder than you might think . For one thing , I do n't usually draw people . Not real people . I like to do stuff with sci-fi or horror . Intense , with a lot of action . The people I draw usually end up having horns or fangs or webbed feet . I think they 're rather cool  --  but they certainly do n't look like anybody you 'd see walking down the street . Not on this planet , anyway . But I 've decided I need to expand my horizons . Besides , until they let us into the movie , I do n't have anything else to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm pretty pleased with it . Sari has easy hair to draw , very dark and tumbly . But her face is more difficult . Partly because right now , it 's a pissed-off face . We 're waiting on this line to get into Sudden Death , which is all about the end of the world and so on . And the line is not moving . Sari 's glaring down the line , like someone 's purposely keeping us out . I say , " Sar , we 'll get in . We have tickets . " " I know . But it 's taking , like , forever . " She runs the back of her arm over her forehead . It 's one of those stinky August days when the sun is like a hammer and the air is like a huge wet hot clothpressed right in your face . You ca n't breathe , you feel gross , and all you want to do is get inside , where there 's air-conditioning . See , the thing is , it 's our last Saturday of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start high school . We have this whole great day planned . I ca n't blame Sari for not wanting to spend it waiting on line . Actually , Sari just hates waiting in general . Looking at my picture , I ca n't decide how to start her face . I should start with the eyes , because they 're definitely what you see first . But then I think I should try something easier , like her chin . A few times , I almost touch the pencil to the paper . But then I chicken out . Glancing at her , I wish she would stand still ; it 's impossible to really see her when she 's turning and twisting so impatiently . I 'd ask her to hold still , but I want the picture to be a surprise . A sort of Last Day of Freedom present . She does n't notice me drawing . We 've been friends so long , she 's totally used to me doodling away . Finally , I decide to risk it . With one stroke , I draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hair to the bottom of the page . Then I look at it , this empty face under a dark storm of hair . I ca n't figure out whether I 've done it right or not . I suspect I have n't . I suspect I 've screwed the whole thing up . I lean back and close my eyes . The sun is really hot on my face , and I imagine that I 'm on a ship , bound for the outer world of Prolus , another exile banished by the Exalted Ones . There is a knife in my boot ; the guards did n't find it . The heat is n't the sun , but the engines of the ship ... Then I hear Sari shout , " Let us in ! " and it 's like I 'm startled out of sleep . Sari starts clapping her hands , starts chanting , " Let us in ! Let us in ! ... " The other people on line are giving her looks . You can tell they 're thinking , Obnoxious teenager . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sit next to THEM . I put my sketch pad away in my backpack and start chanting with Sari . Together we yell , " Let us in ! Let us in ! " We do a little dance while we chant , swinging our arms and doing kicks on " in , " like some kind of crazed Rockettes . I 'm laughing so hard , I ca n't breathe . I 'm wondering how long I can keep this up when all of a sudden , people start coming out of the theater . The line starts to move . As it takes a big leap forward , Sari puts her arms above her head and cheers . Sari and I have been best friends since seventh grade . We had the same gym class , and we were always the last two picked for every team . Me because I was bad , Sari because she just did n't care . One game , the teacher made Sari be goalie , and she let the ball roll right into the goal . The other team started jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down on the bench next to me . I held my hand up , and we slapped hands . Basically , it was inevitable that we became best friends . We are essentially the only normal people in our entire school , the only girls not obsessed with their weight or hair , the only girls who do n't communicate by squealing and squeaking . I mean , there are a few other people not like that . But a lot of people are afraid of the cliques . You can tell they 'd like to be accepted by them . Whereas Sari and I despise them and fear no one . The movie 's dumb but kind of fun . I can watch anything that shows you a big black sky with billions of stars , the standard shot of any space action movie . In this one , a group of astronauts have to blow up Mars before it hits the earth . After the movie , I say how there 's no way a single bomb would destroy Mars , whether or not you blow it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way she would spend her last night alive with Bailey Watts , the guy who played the dudely dude second in command . As we head toward the bus stop , Sari says , " At your house we 're doing the Book , right ? " I nod . " Absolutely . " Sari 's sleeping over , and we catch the crosstown bus to my house . While she stares out the window , I go into my knapsack and get out my sketch pad . Looking at my drawing , I see I have n't gotten her at all . Even when Sari 's just looking out the window , there are a million things going on in her face . All I have here is some squiggles . I do n't know why drawing real people is so hard , but annoyingly , it is . I think I see it , I think I have it right . Then I try to get it on paper , and somehow , it all just disintegrates . In my head , I know what it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nothing ends up the way I saw it . It 's totally frustrating . Then I notice this guy across the aisle is staring at us . Well , really at Sari . He 's not trying to hide it , either . He 's old . Not old old , but way too old to be staring at a couple of kids like us . I stare back , and he looks away . This happened a lot this summer . All of a sudden , men who could be in college or even married were checking Sari out . Mostly , it was just funny . But one time , a guy ran after us and asked her to marry him . It freaked her out , I could tell . The bus rolls to a halt at my stop . As we get off , I glance back . The guy 's watching again . I give him a look like , Creep , and jump off the bus . I live on the tenth floor of our building . In the elevator , Sari pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Which , frankly , she almost does . I want to ask her if she noticed the creep on the bus . But I decide not to . It might upset her . As we ride up , Sari asks , " What do you think the Book 's going to say ? " I close my eyes and intone : " The Book must keep its secrets until the time is right . " My parents have gone out to dinner , so the apartment is dark and silent when we open the front door . I call , " Hello ? " and hear the click-click-click of my dog , Nobo , coming down the hall to greet us . Sari gives him a quick smile . Being a confirmed cat person , she is not entirely wild about dogs . We order in a pizza and eat it in the kitchen , passing an enormous bottle of Coke between us . Nobo lies under the table , hoping for the best . " Okay , here 's a question . " Sari tips her head back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night on earth  --  who do you spend it with ? " I have no answer to this , so I guess . " My family ? " Sari rolls her eyes . " No , I mean , like a guy . Like the movie . " I think . I hate questions like this . Sari loves them . Sari presses . " Your last night on earth . " " James Stewart . " " He 's dead , " says Sari . She gives me a funny look , like she 's worried I do n't know this . Or do n't care . I shrug . " Guess I 'm out of luck on my last night on earth . " " Come on , what about someone real ? " says Sari . " Someone you know ? " I made a barfing sound . " Come on , " she says . " Think of everyone you know . " " I am thinking of everyone I know . " " You never know , " Sari says . " High school could offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like that 's so likely . " I take a slug of soda . " What about you ? Who do you spend your last twenty-four hours with ? " I though she 'd have an immediate answer , but Sari thinks about it for a long time . Finally , she says , " I do n't know . I do n't think I 've met him yet . " Then she sets down her glass . " I think it 's time for the Book . " Because it 's time for the Book , we do n't turn any of the lights on in the rest of the apartment . We creep down the hall to my room , where slowly , I open the door . Then I switch on the light , because otherwise , we wo n't be able to see anything . Plus , I forgot to clean my room , and I do n't want anyone to break their neck . Unfortunately , when I turn on the light , I see something else I forgot to do . I forgot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taped everything I did over the summer up on the wall to see if I had gotten any better . It 's not something I 'd want anyone seeing anyway  --  even Sari  --  but what makes it worse is that almost every single drawing is of Hollow Planet . Hollow Planet is this series of sci-fi books about a world inhabited by people known as the Exalteds . The Hollow Planet is a perfect world , there 's no crime or violence , and nobody there is ugly or poor or stupid . But part of the reason the Hollow Planet is perfect is that its leaders have exiled all the criminals , thieves , and undesirables to the off-world of Prolus . The books are about the wars between the two groups . I am obsessed with Hollow Planet . Sari is totally not . I say , " Do n't look at those , they 're bad . " Sari does n't listen . In fact , she goes right up to look at them . I cringe . So , I 'm ridiculously fixated . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing something else while Sari checks out a picture of a woman with wild flame hair , wielding a sword above her head . Queen Rana , leader of the Undesirables . At least , as I envision her . Then Sari peers at the drawing next to it and grins . " Who 's Tusk Boy ? " I can tell from her face , she thinks the whole thing is ridiculous . " Forget it , it 's dumb . Let 's do the Book . " That gets her away from the drawings . Raising her fists , Sari exclaims , " Fetch the Book ! " Intensely relieved , I go under my bed , where I keep the Book in a special box . Sari drags an old round rug to the middle of the room and settles down , cross-legged , on one side of it . I sit down opposite her . " What are you going to ask it ? " " About this year . What 's going to happen this year . " Now the Book , in case you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just a paperback of David Copperfield , which Sari and I read last year in English . We 've decided it has the power to tell the future . We do have a reason for this . One day last year , we were studying for a test on David Copperfield and Sari was all worried she would n't pass  --  basically because she had n't read any of it . Finally , I said , " Let 's ask the book . " Sari looked at me like , Yes , she has finally lost her mind . " Ask the book ? " " Yeah . Who would know better if you 're going to pass a test on David Copperfield than Charles Dickens ? " So half joking , we held up the book and asked it if Sari would pass . Then I opened it , and without looking , Sari placed a finger on the page . For a second , we stood , nervously not looking at the page and feeling kind of stupid . Then I peeked at the sentence under Sari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora . " That means I pass ? " said Sari . I shrugged . " I guess . " And when she did pass  --  even though she spent more time worrying than studying  --  we decided to consult the Book on all matters of importance . Sari is really into the Book . In some ways , even more than I am . It 's been right a few times ; it 's been wrong a lot , too . But once she 's found something to believe in , Sari does n't let go . Fate , destiny , what 's " meant to be "  --  she believes in all that stuff . I lift the Book between us , cover closed . I say to Sari , " Will you speak the words ? " Sari closes her eyes . " Tell us , O Book , how does the future look ? " I wait . " Do you want to do it ? " Sari shakes her head . " No , you . " I open it , point , and read out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sari winces . " Ouch . " It 's dumb , but I ca n't help wondering : Is that my future or Sari 's ? Or both ? I want it to at least be both . I hand her the Book . " You go . " Sari nods . Closing my eyes , I chant , " Tell us , O Book , how does the future look ? " Sari opens and points . She points very fast , her finger landing so hard on the page , I 'm afraid she 'll tear it . " What does it say ? " Sari reads , " ' A new one . ' " She brightens up . " That 's pretty good . " I 'm jealous . The stupid Book has given Sari a better reading than me . I take the Book from her . " Yeah , but it 's referring to Mr. Murdstone . As David 's new father . " " So ? " " So , Murdstone 's evil . " Sari rolls her eyes . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning . " Sari snorts . " It 's not a warning . It means something new . Like new opportunities or love or  --  " I interrupt . " Well , if it 's a guy , he 's a jerk . " I can tell from Sari 's face I should give it up . I know I 'm being a little creepy , but still . You ca n't take half the fortune and not the other half . You have to deal with the whole thing . The thing with Sari is , she hears what she wants to hear sometimes . Still , it 's just a stupid game . So why are Sari and I all annoyed and not saying anything ? Then she says , " Why do n't you go again ? Maybe it was n't warmed up yet . " I want to say no . Rules are rules , and I had my go . But then I feel all panicky , like the Book does have power , and somehow , the difference in what it told me and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to have the same year . Not the same things happening to us , but ... I do n't know . I want us to feel the same way about things . Not her all excited , and me " Anxious to be gone . " Going again is probably cheating . But I ca n't stand how it feels between me and Sari right now . I 'm about to pick up the Book when there 's a knock on the door . Hiding the Book under the bed , I yell , " Come in , " and my mom opens the door and sticks her head in . Sari waves . " Hi , Mrs. Horvath . " " Hi , Sari . " She smiles at me . " Do n't worry , I 'm not going to interrupt . I just want to tell you , spare towels and pillows are in the linen closet , okay ? Now I 'll get out of your way . " " Say hi to Dad , " I say as Mom closes the door . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like a spell 's been broken , and we 're not sure what to do . Finally , Sari says , " So , go ahead . Do it again . " I look over at the Book . " No . I think it tells you what it tells you , and you have to accept it . " Sari nods . Then she grins . " You know what ? It 's just a dumb book . " After that , we put the Book away and discuss the following issues : Will being a freshman suck ? ( Yes . ) How much will it suck ? ( A lot . ) Will we ever make it to sophomore year , or will we be the first people at Eldridge never to leave ninth grade ? Sari says if she does n't make it out of ninth grade , I ca n't leave either . And vice versa  --  if I fail absolutely everything , she 'll stay behind with me . For a second , I imagine myself as a 102-year-old freshman . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to understand algebra . Around midnight , my mom knocks on the door and says , " Good night , girls , " in this way that means : lights off . I unfold my futon chair and drag my sleeping bag out of the closet for Sari . She changes into a T-shirt of mine that has a big dog on the front , then settles right in , lying back with a sigh . I go to turn off the light , then get into my bed . For a second , I ca n't see anything . Then I pull the blinds open so the moonlight comes in , and Sari 's there , staring up at the ceiling like she 's thinking about something really serious . " Sar ? " " Yeah ? " " If you could pick one thing not to happen this year , what would it be ? " " Um ... that I do n't completely flunk out . What about you ? " I flop on my back and concentrate . Into the dark , I whisper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eldridge . " I say " evil " in a way that makes Sari laugh . Then , for a long time , we do n't say anything . I think about the day . It was a good Last Day of Freedom . Even if it did n't end perfectly . I wish my picture of Sari had been good enough to give to her . " Sar ? " " Yeah ? " " What 's the thing you want to happen most ? " Sari 's quiet for a while . " I do n't want to say . " " Come on . " " No , it 's ... I ca n't explain it . It 's too big . Forget it . What about you ? " " No way , I 'm not saying if you 're not . " " Jess ... " " Nuh-uh . That 's it , time for sleep . " As I listen to Sari turn over , the rustle of the sleeping bag , I wonder what I would have said if Sari had said what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine I 'm free to have anything I want . In my head , I hear ... To draw . Draw better . Have people like what I do . Hang with Sari . Not be around people I ca n't stand . Then I think , Forget having people like what I do . That should n't be important . Art is n't about being liked . It 's about being ... Being free . But I do n't see how you 're free at school . Then I hear Sari whisper , " Jess ? " " Hmm ? " " What do you think will really happen ? " " This year ? " " Yeah . " I think for a very long time . But the future is too big . It 's like when I sit on the beach and try to draw the ocean . I ca n't get my eyes around it , and I always end up with a straight , flat line that does n't look like anything . " I do n't know . " " Me either . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I whisper , " Good night . " For a long time , there 's just silence . For a second , I wonder if Sari 's asleep . Then I hear her say good night back , and I feel like this year will be okay . No matter what .
