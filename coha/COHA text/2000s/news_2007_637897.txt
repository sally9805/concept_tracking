<p> Remember the days before Harry Potter ? <p> It seems long ago and far away , but it has been only nine years since the boy wizard crashed into the American consciousness like an out-of-control owl . That was before the frenzied mobs buying Harry Potter books , before the star-studded Potter movie premieres , the piles of Potter merchandise , the scores of Potter websites , Potter rock bands , Potter literature courses , the planned Potter theme park . In less than a decade , America has become a sort of Harry **31;1014;TOOLONG . <p> Now , as the seventh and last book in J.K. Rowling 's Potter saga , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , is poised for release Friday at midnight , it 's time to look back and ask : Why did this series turn into such a massive , culture-altering phenomenon ? How did this bespectacled British boy ensnare millions of readers of all ages , transcending languages , cultures and national boundaries with his magic spell ? <p> Exactly why are we all so wild about Harry ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Potter was n't part of pop culture , and it 's difficult , " says Michael Stromenger , 28 , a new father and television production assistant in Fargo , N.D. , who has been obsessed with Harry since age 19 , when Stromenger was working in a bookstore . " It 's pervasive , it 's far-reaching , hard to escape . Which is great , because I love the books . " <p> The answer to the why-Harry ? question is complicated and yet it 's not . It comes down to this : Quality will rise to the top , especially with help from the Internet . <p> " In the midst of all the hype , people forget it caught on because it was a good book , " says Kansas State University 's Philip Nel , director of the children's-lit program and author of the first book-length academic study of Harry Potter , J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter Novels : A Reader 's Guide , in 2001 . He and colleague Karin Westman , head of the English department who is just finishing up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Context , have taken turns teaching a class on Potter that is so popular , it draws long waiting lists . <p> Rowling knows her classics <p> Heir to a long tradition of English literary abracadabra , the classics-educated Rowling absorbed scores of genres and themes , especially the British boarding-school novel , and synthesized them into her own unique storytelling recipe , Nel and Westman say . The result is a ripping good read  --  funny , touching and riveting , modern and old-fashioned at the same time . <p> " You are always waiting to find out what happens next , " Nel says . " She has real , recognizable characters grounded in everyday experiences we can understand and relate to , so we care about what happens to them , which makes the mystery and narrative drive all the more compelling . She has imagined ( Harry 's world ) so fully and with such great detail . " <p> And she has virtually no rival , in any sense of the word , Westman says . " In terms of cultural knowledge , everyone knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't read the books . <p> " That level is somewhat similar to J.R.R. Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings series in the 1960s , but what Rowling has added to pop familiarity is the incredible surge in children readers and reluctant ( adult ) readers . " <p> Harry also is a boundary jumper able to engage unrelated audiences : Children and adults like him , readers and filmgoers , all classes , incomes and educational levels . <p> He has been translated into 65 languages , published in nearly every country on the planet . He 's a touchstone for an entire generation that grew up with him . <p> " When I was 11 , Harry was about 11 . Now I 'm 16 , Harry is about the same , " says high school senior Christina Stanfield of Newport , Ky . " It feels like I 've been there with him every step of the way . " <p> But the unprecedented factor in the Harry Potter phenom is the Internet , which intensifies the fan experience , magnifies word-of-mouth and provides a platform for spontaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet ' immersion in fandom ' <p> " Previously , reading was a private act , but now you can share it with others on the Internet , " says Megan Linehan , 23 , a Potterian from age 14 , whose undergrad literature thesis at American University last year was on the political and social themes in the books . <p> The Internet allowed " a new kind of immersion in fandom " not possible before and certainly not when Tolkien 's books achieved cult status decades ago , says Roger Sutton , editor of The Horn Book magazine on children 's literature . <p> " I thought ( the momentum ) would level off , but it gets bigger and bigger with each book , " Sutton says . <p> " This is not some evil marketing plot by ( U.S. Potter publisher ) Scholastic , and it 's not some weird Disney plot , either ; children around the world have chosen something for themselves , and more power to them . " <p> By now , Harry Potter bestrides the Internet like a colossus ( especially lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll die in the last book ) . There are millions of sites , blogs , podcasts and postings : Google " Harry Potter " and 97.7 million results appear . <p> " The two main sites , Mugglenet.com and The-Leaky-Cauldron.org , are so big in the Harry Potter sphere that Rowling chose to do in-depth interviews with the two webmasters of those sites , " Westman says . <p> The ' nary-a-Potter camp ' <p> True , a few people hated Harry Potter . Some Christian preachers denounced him from their pulpits for promoting witchcraft and the occult . They were mostly ignored . Even people who are n't fans still admire Harry and his creator and cheerfully acknowledge his pervasive presence . <p> " I 'm in the nary-a-Potter camp , " jokes writer , mother and public radio host Amy Krouse Rosenthal . " Ten billion people ca n't be wrong , but I guess there 's something about my genetic makeup . I just do n't get it . But I do n't have disdain for the movement . " <p> So Harry Potter has slouched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other fictional character . Others have prevailed in one or more areas , but none has hit them all like Harry . <p> Harry Potter Halloween costumes ? Check , but costume shops have featured a zillion other TV , film and comic-book characters for years . Harry fan fiction ? Check , but Star Trek followers and fans of scores of other TV cult series were scribbling about their favorite characters even before the Internet . Harry in academia ? Check , but America 's higher-ed fields being as quirky as they sometimes are , there 's always someone studying the semiotics of The Sopranos or the like . Harry merchandise ? Check , but mass-marketing of merchandise linked to fictional characters has been standard for decades in America . <p> Wizard rock , Wizarding World <p> But what other fictional character has been the inspiration for a new genre of rock ' n ' roll known as " wizard rock " ? <p> It started seven years ago with two Boston brothers , Paul and Joe DeGeorge , who call themselves Harry and the Potters and write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> By now , says Paul DeGeorge , 28 , there 's a subculture of at least 200 wizard-rock garage bands , promoting themselves online and touring regions of the country , sometimes playing at libraries and even raising money for literacy charities . <p> " Harry Potter has become a participatory culture , " DeGeorge says . <p> Then there 's the ultimate affirmation in the pop-culture pantheon : the Florida theme park . It will be called The Wizarding World of Harry Potter , located on 20 acres within Universal Orlando Resort 's Islands of Adventure theme park and will open in late 2009 . <p> The idea is to take the books and the films ( Warner Bros. is a partner , and Rowling has approved the project ) to the next level in experiential entertainment , says Universal 's Scott Trowbridge , who is designing the park . " We 're taking it from the screen and putting you in it , " he says . " We 're going to create a physical embodiment of that world so that people can experience firsthand a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Meanwhile , the book industry anxiously searches the horizon for the next Rowling , the next Harry Potter . So far , no luck , despite a wealth of talent in kid lit . <p> " Harry Potter in some ways put children 's literature on the map , " says HarperCollins ' Susan Rich , editor of the popular Lemony Snicket books . " People are always buzzing about the next best seller , but if we knew how to call it ahead of time , we 'd be signing ' em up . " <p> Still , the industry can almost certainly count on Harry to keep selling for some time , and not just because there will be two more movies coming . Most critics consider these books classics likely to endure , like Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland or Charlotte 's Web . <p> Always here to save the day <p> So Harry may be going , but he 'll never be gone . He 'll live on in the hearts of millions , as they say in eulogies , but more to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " This is the last generation that actually had to wait for each book to come out , so they 're going to have a special relationship with Harry , " says pop-culture historian Robert Thompson of Syracuse University . <p> " But for at least another century , every year a new batch of kids will be introduced to Harry Potter . There 's always going to be a new kid turning 8 years old . " <p> So take heart , world : We 'll always have Harry . <p> Potter and friends conjure up astronomical sums <p> It 's a Harry Potter world . <p> The bespectacled boy wizard is seemingly everywhere in pop culture , from books to movies to products such as action figures . <p> Books <p> 121.5 million in print in the USA for first six books . First printing for seventh and final book , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows : 12 million . <p> Films <p> $1.175 billion total U.S. box office for the first four films since 2001 .
