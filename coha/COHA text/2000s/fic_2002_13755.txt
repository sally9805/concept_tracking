( Lights fade up on MADELEINE 'S Del Mar home . Present is MADELEINE who stares at piles of flats that are ready to be taped and shaped into moving boxes . A few open , finished boxes rest off to one side . Enter HAYLEY from the back of the house with armfuls of clothes . Her delicacy is now encased in a surface hardness that is both clarifying and intimidating . She trips over the flats , which infuriates her , and then dumps the clothing onto the sofa . ) HAYLEY See Mother ? It 's in the way . It 's got to go . ( HAYLEY starts to fold clothes haphazardly . ) MADELEINE This is not what normal people do on Thanksgiving . ( HARRY , dressed entirely in white but normal clothes , hair white , skin glistening powdery white , enters as if looking for something . He is not aware of them ; he is just a spirit in motion . As he crosses the living room , MADELEINE smiles at the sight of him . Upon seeing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before returning to his search . ) HAYLEY Daddy was the only normal person in our family . I do n't see anybody normal here . MADELEINE ( looking at HARRY ) I do . p. 4 HAYLEY Who ? MADELEINE ( collecting herself ) Uh , me . I mean me , of course . I 'm a normal person . HAYLEY Yes Mother . Granted , you used to be . Maybe . Get past a two-twenty I.Q. and it 's questionable . MADELEINE ( regarding the clothes ) Stop it . Harry 's clothes are too nice to give away to strangers . Look at you , folding his clothes like a savage . Did n't a shred of my precision pass on to you ? HAYLEY Precisely . That is why I 'm going to pack up all of Daddy 's stuff in as organized a fashion as constant interruption will allow , get them to a shelter , and start putting this behind us . MADELEINE Just like that , huh ? Just like closing a deal and moving on to the next one . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a whole year . MADELEINE Put those clothes down . HAYLEY Go do something , Mother . Anything . Bake a pie . You used to have your prize blueberry pie waiting for me when I walked in the door . MADELEINE You bake it and leave these things alone . Did n't I teach you how to bake ? You might as well change your kitchen into a bedroom so at least you 'd get some use out of it . p. 5 HAYLEY Leave off , Mother . Now . You are not going to make me talk about my sex life no matter what you do . MADELEINE You leave off . This is my house . These are my things . HAYLEY Daddy 's things . MADELEINE My husband 's things . HAYLEY And you 're buried in them . It would take the jaws of life to pluck you out . MADELEINE Do n't worry . I 've " processed my grief , " as you say . ( MADELEINE watches HARRY still searching ; HAYLEY is too busy with the clothes and boxes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . HAYLEY I beg your pardon ? MADELEINE His phonograph . I bought him that CD play -- . ( stops as she realizes that HAYLEY is studying her curiously ) HAYLEY Mom , the mere thought of Daddy makes you loopy . MADELEINE That 's how it was through forty-five years of marriage . Why should it be any different now ? I should have spent more time with him . We should have gone back to Hana for vacation like he wanted . And I was so impatient with him those last few weeks because he was obsessed with fixing that old phonograph . I hid it in the attic . p. 6 HAYLEY News flash , Mother : Daddy 's dead , and you 're not . Enough with this depression . MADELEINE People in my generation do n't get depressed ; that 's your generation 's fad . My generation just has bad days . HAYLEY You mean like 365 of them ? MADELEINE ( smells a shirt ) It still smells like him . ( HAYLEY sighs in exasperation and exits to the back of the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently smells her hair , which makes her smile . HAYLEY returns with more clothes and dumps them on the sofa . HARRY nods with resignation . ) HAYLEY Why do you have that loopy look on your face again ? MADELEINE What do you think you 're doing ? You do n't just go into our room and take what you like . HAYLEY Mother , Daddy would want us to do this . He was a move-on kind of person . MADELEINE Ca n't this wait until spring ? We can do it with the spring cleaning . ( on HAYLEY 'S look ) Okay , okay . You need the closure , I guess . HAYLEY What are you talking about ? You need it . MADELEINE I 'm old . That 's closure enough . p. 7 HAYLEY Mother , at some point , you have to get rid of his slippers , clothes , shaving cream . You have to release them so you can release yourself , too . MADELEINE Do I get to keep the memories ? HAYLEY Yeah . MADELEINE Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) Come on . You make boxes ; I 'll fold . Help me help you . MADELEINE This is n't helping me . Is it helping you ? HAYLEY Mom ( she has read it all ) grief turns into depression when it 's prolonged . It 's understandable : Dad was the love of your life and your best friend , and he 's gone . ( HARRY begins to feel a bit of consternation about not finding phonograph . MADELEINE tries not to react to him , but his presence remains seductive . ) MADELEINE Tell me , Hayley will you ever have a love of your life ? HAYLEY Mom . MADELEINE It 's just that , for the last year or so , you merely seem to tolerate men between making investment deals . HAYLEY When you were an English professor , you were busy . p. 8 MADELEINE Instead of packing up your father 's things , why do n't you focus on yourself , dear . You are n't yourself anymore . HAYLEY Who am I then ? And , while we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen my mother in a while . MADELEINE ( a pause and then : ) You forgot Mother 's Day this year . HAYLEY Mother , I ca n't be your life . Just because you 're retired and Daddy 's gone does n't mean that I have to fill up all that empty space for you . I 'm only one person with a hell of a lot of empty space myself . MADELEINE Then get married . HAYLEY To what ? The only decent man I have a relationship with is the janitor at my office --  MADELEINE You 're sleeping with the --  HAYLEY I work late , Mom . Rafael 's there just doing his job . ( HARRY is amused . ) MADELEINE Rafael ? You 're on a first-name basis ? HAYLEY He 's nice to me . Sometimes he gives me candy . MADELEINE He wants to have sex with you . Especially if it 's chocolate . HAYLEY It 's Italian . p. 9 MADELEINE What 's Italian ? HAYLEY The nougat . MADELEINE The nougat ? Please tell me that 's not code for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( a pause , then ) Mom , one day , I 'll bring home a beautiful person who 's the best partner for me , a best friend and soul-mate who makes the moon seem full even when it is n't , okay ? MADELEINE And will he have a job ? HAYLEY Will I have a job . MADELEINE You mean you might get fired ? How could someone like you get fired ? HAYLEY It 's been a tough year , Mom . My boss says he understands , but understanding has a short shelf-life in corporate America . I had hoped to make partner by now , but MADELEINE My generation wanted to have a partner . Your generation 's chief goal is making partner . HAYLEY At least I have a goal . MADELEINE I do n't need a goal ; I need a grave . HAYLEY Mother , your golden years should be about , " What is it that I still want ? " p. 10 MADELEINE No , Nadine says it 's more like , " What is it I can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that May Sarton poses in her memoirs : " At the bottom of the silence what lies in wait ? Is it love ? Is it death ? Too early or too late ? What is it I can have that I still want ? " HAYLEY ( responding to noises of revelry coming from NADINE 'S ) Just exactly how does Nadine celebrate Thanksgiving over there ? They sure are noisy.How 's Conrad doing ? Her " perfect son " ? MADELEINE If you would have married Conrad --  HAYLEY Ever think about selling this house , Mother ? There are excellent retirement communities that would allow you to have an active social life . MADELEINE I have a social life . HAYLEY Mother , I 'm your social life . ( MADELEINE fixes a stray lock of HAYLEY 'S hair ) Are you reading the magazines I ordered for you ? MADELEINE How much does one really need to know about food , wine , and travel ? HAYLEY Ever thought about having an affair , Mother ? ( HARRY absorbs this with dismay and sadness . Unable to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at MADELEINE. ) p. 11 MADELEINE Do n't be ridiculous . HAYLEY What 's so ridiculous about enjoying life ? You want me to have one ; why do n't you have one too ? We can double-date . MADELEINE Enjoying life is for young people . I 'm just tolerating my process of death . HAYLEY It would do you good to have an affair , Mother . It would do me good if you would have an affair . MADELEINE Will you just look at the mess you 've made of my living room ? HAYLEY Maybe I 'll send you an exercise machine . MADELEINE Do n't . Do n't do anything . Do n't touch Harry 's clothes . Do n't make me over . Just come home and relax a little before you go back to your urbane San Francisco life . Just like you always used to do when you came home for the holidays . HAYLEY Urbane ? What do you mean by that ? MADELEINE What ? Do n't you always say that San Francisco is California 's only cosmopolitan city ? HAYLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayley-bunthrowing everything out is not going to bring anyone back , and it 's certainly not going to get rid of your grief . Just take your time . Grief is a process . p. 12 HAYLEY I do n't have time , Mother . My boss cracks a mean whip . And , besides , I 'm not grieving . MADELEINE Uh-huh . Then it 's a paper moon . ( The doorbell rings and MADELEINE exits to answer it . Quickly , HAYLEY punches in a number on her cell phone . ) HAYLEY Hey there . Miss me ? I 'm coming back early . My mother 's driving me crazy . No , I did n't tell her . No one gets to tell Madeleine Palmer anything . She spent her life giving speeches and reciting poetry . You do n't get to talk to her until the Q&amp;A . ( MADELEINE enters with NADINE THOMAS , who carries a pie . ) HAYLEY ( into phone ) Call you later . I love you like crazy . ( disconnects and puts the phone in her pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HAYLEY For what ? THOMAS You said you loved me like crazy . HAYLEY Did I say that ? THOMAS If you were n't talking to me , then who were you talking to ? Do n't hold out on us . HAYLEY I was talking to my guitar teacher . p. 13 THOMAS Sounds promising . HAYLEY Yes . I 'll be able to play " Eleanor Rigby " by the spring . THOMAS Is that all ? Oh , Hayley . Is he single at least ? MADELEINE I think it 's wonderful , dear . You 'll play it for me , yes ? HAYLEY Sure , Mom . THOMAS When was the last time you were home ? For your father 's funeral , was n't it , Hayley ? HAYLEY Yes , Nadine . THOMAS Yes . Yes indeed . Anyway , I just stopped by to give you this little pie I baked up . MADELEINE Oh . A pie . Uh , thank you . HAYLEY Ummm . What kind ? THOMAS Tangerine Cloud . MADELEINE My . THOMAS I ca n't stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayley ? He 's here with little Joey . Do you know that Conrad 's been coming to visit nearly every month since Joey was born . HAYLEY Connie has a kid ? Why did n't you tell me , Mother ? MADELEINE Because it involved talking about marriage , which for you is like discussing bowel movements at tea . p. 14 THOMAS I 'd better go . My son ca n't stand me being away for too long . See you at Christmas , Hayley . Madeleine , when are we going to start those walks on the beach ? MADELEINE It 's cold at the beach . THOMAS The beach is exciting . There are all kinds of people there . I met a nice older gentleman walking his dog . HAYLEY You go Nadine ! THOMAS But he wore a pin that said , " My WIFE gave me this dog for Christmas . " All the good ones are taken . HAYLEY Yes . All the good men . MADELEINE Or they 're dead . Haunting you . THOMAS Oh , Madeleine . Looks like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pie . ( exits ) MADELEINE ( taste a pinch of the crust ) Store-bought crust . Probably filling from a box . Decent enough though . HAYLEY Do n't be a baking snob , Mother . Just because you and Betty Crocker are the only ones still baking from absolute scratch does n't mean the rest of us are going to hell . It 's the thought that counts . MADELEINE It 's the thought that obligates you . p. 15 HAYLEY Mother . ( HAYLEY folds more clothes , but MADELEINE decides to sit right on top of them . ) HAYLEY Mom . MADELEINE Hayle . I do n't absolutely have to have a grand-child , but I do n't want you to be alone . Bring someone home someday , okay ? If not a grandchild , at least a child-like friend . HAYLEY Yes , well MADELEINE Do n't worry . One day I 'll bake again . I 'm sure I will . I may even finish writing my new book . HAYLEY Just move , Mother . MADELEINE Move ? Where ? HAYLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could you be a little less profound , dear ? ( not moving from the clothes ) Do you think they know how to roast a turkey properly in heaven ? HAYLEY You 're going to wrinkle the clothes , Mom . MADELEINE Oh , I forgot . Ever since your father died , you 're an atheist . HAYLEY A skeptic , Mother . I mean , do n't they say that when a door closes , a window will open somewhere else ? Where 's the window ? p. 16 MADELEINE Okay , Harry 'll just have to have Thanksgiving dinner with us . Ca n't have him eating improperly roasted turkey , even if angels prepare it . I 'm sure they mean well . HAYLEY Whatever you say , Mother . MADELEINE What about Christmas ? Should we have goose this year ? HAYLEY Well MADELEINE Of course , it 's oilier , but you know Daddy liked it . HAYLEY Mom MADELEINE Yes dear ? You have another idea ? HAYLEY Mom I 'm I 'm not going to able to come home for Christmas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HAYLEY I have to work through the holidays . MADELEINE Of course . HAYLEY I 'm lucky to have been able to come for Thanksgiving . MADELEINE I understand . HAYLEY In fact , I have to go back earlier than planned . Some things have come up . Pressing matters . p. 17 MADELEINE I have opera tickets for tomorrow . HAYLEY Take Nadine . I 'm leaving tomorrow . MADELEINE But , without a Saturday night stay , wo n't it be expensive ? ( HAYLEY is silent ) Maybe I could come to San Francisco for Christmas . HAYLEY I really wo n't have time to entertain . MADELEINE So who will you have Christmas dinner with then ? Rafael ? HAYLEY Mother , you do n't have a right to know anything except that I 'm alive and well and that I love you . Ca n't we talk about an interesting novel you 've read , the garden -- the now dead garden -- or the art of the English language like we used to ? Did everything die with Daddy ? MADELEINE Well , my mother always said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . So bless me , Mother , and let me have a life that is n't dependent on your happiness , and vice versa . MADELEINE Are you happy ? HAYLEY no . MADELEINE I 'm not either . HAYLEY ( to herself , mostly ) Que sera sera . p. 18 MADELEINE ( a pause ) Will you take a shuttle to the airport or may I drive you ? HAYLEY I 'll take a taxi . MADELEINE But it 's expensive . HAYLEY Mom , just give me some space , okay ? MADELEINE Space ? HAYLEY Space . ( starts to leave the room ) MADELEINE I put one of your favorite mints on your --  HAYLEY Listen to me , Mother . You ca n't preserve my past like a museum exhibit . My bedroom looks like " Room of a Former Daughter . " Get rid of my old furniture . For goodness sake , take that Bruce Springsteen poster off the wall so I can forget what he looked like when he was twenty-five saints-alive . Life can never sustain that kind of beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Turn my room into a guest room , okay ? Take in a foreign student . Leap into the present , Mother , before it gives way under your feet . Because when that happens , it goes like quicksand . MADELEINE Can I keep the pink baby sweater I knit for you ? HAYLEY Who 's ever going to wear it ? My big toe ? Mother , you idealize everything . It 's just an old sweater , not an object of art . p. 19 MADELEINE I do n't knit anymore . HAYLEY You do n't do anything anymore . ( a brief pause and then : ) Good-night . ( exits ) ( MADELEINE sits alone . HARRY arrives carrying a box . He is gleeful . He sits in another chair and removes from the box his old phonograph . At the sight of it , MADELEINE is amused , but then slowly tearful . HARRY tries to fix the phonograph , but the task seems impossible at present . Giving up , he removes a newspaper from the box and begins reading it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always the spirit in motion . ) MADELEINE She thinks you 're gone , Harry , but that 's because she 's not a believer . ( disturbed that he takes no notice of her ) Are you really here ? Harry ? Can you hear me ? ( As she grows emotional , his counterpoint is to laugh at things he is reading . This hurts her . ) MADELEINE What can I have that I still want ? What do I want that I can still have ? My whole life is nothing but a sidecar to Hayley 's and now she 's driving away and I do n't know if she 'll ever really be back . Oh she might show up-just like you , but she wo n't really hear me or see me . I 'll just be background noise to her real life . Nadine says exercise will change things : walk on the beach , walk on the beach . Hayley says it only takes a dream . But you were my dream , Harry -- more important than writing any book or teaching anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod out and falls asleep . MADELEINE suppresses tears. ) p. 20 MADELEINE Harry , I 'm having a bad day , a really bad day . ( a whisper ) Something 's got to give . ( She turns out the light and exits. ) p. 21 Act 1 , Scene 2 Scene Two ( Four days before Christmas . MADELEINE has regressed from her usual sophistication to looking frazzled and disheveled ; she is still in her pajamas although the sunlight filtering in indicates it is high noon . HARRY 'S clothes are strewn about in piles . There is a rather large box exercise-machine size to one side of the room . She picks up a magazine and tries to read it , but finds it overwhelming just to turn the pages properly . She tosses it into a garbage can . She stares at a tray of tea with toast and apple . She picks up the apple and cuts a slice . She is about to put it in her mouth , but , having no appetite , lowers it to the plate . The paring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable length of time . The ring of the doorbell startles her , causing her to drop the knife . The doorbell rings again . Slowly , she goes to the window and waves . Seemingly against her will , she gestures for someone to enter . NADINE enters . Her vitality is at cross-purposes with MADELEINE 'S lethargy . ) THOMAS Oh , honey , it 's like you were a statue or something . And in your pajamas when the day 's half over . You look like a frumpy senior citizen long resident in a mental institution . Are you having another bad day ? MADELEINE Hello Nadine . THOMAS I was afraid you 're not eating so I made you some cookies . Healthy granola cookies . Conrad 's own recipe . p. 22 MADELEINE No more food , Nadine . THOMAS You have to eat , honey . MADELEINE It feels worse in the mornings , but , at night , there 's less pressure . THOMAS Oh I get that , too . Sinuses , huh ? MADELEINE Yes , Nadine . Sinuses . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowl of key lime pie and French Chardonnay . THOMAS I 'm taking an antihistamine . Are you taking anything ? MADELEINE Yes . An anti-depressant . THOMAS Oh . I 'm sorry ; that 's what you mean . But at least that 's a step in the right direction . At least you 're dealing with these bad days . Here . These cookies ought to keep just fine over four days so Hayley can eat them when she gets here on Christmas . You said she was coming on Christmas Day , right ? MADELEINE Christmas ? Yes . Right . THOMAS Would you like me to help you box up Harry 's clothes ? I can even take them to the shelter for you . MADELEINE No thank you . THOMAS But you 've taken them out and --  MADELEINE No thank you . p. 23 THOMAS Okay . So any chance Hayley will bring someone home for Christmas ? MADELEINE Certainly . Prince William . THOMAS Poor Madeleine . Conrad always favored her , but she was too busy to give him the time of day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Madeleine . MADELEINE Lives ca n't be synchronized , Nadine . When she was ready , he was n't . When he was ready , she was n't interested anymore . I was stupid enough to think that Harry 's life-time would be synchronized with mine . ( a pause , then : ) I do n't wear a watch either . ( NADINE sees the paring knife , picks it up , studies MADELEINE for a second , and then places the knife on the tray . ) THOMAS Do n't tell me you want to synchronize your life with Harry 's ? MADELEINE I just thought Harry would out-live me . I should have died first . THOMAS I got over my husband in a week . MADELEINE Because he ran off with your housekeeper . THOMAS Yes , I always thought she was a bit too good at getting down on all fours and polishing the floors . Apparently , she was polishing something else , too . And I did n't even know it could still rise to the occasion . p. 24 MADELEINE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameless . THOMAS At least I made you laugh . You know , when Hayley comes , we ought to go out to one of those comedy clubs together . MADELEINE I was going to take her to a place she 's always wanted to visit . THOMAS Where 's that ? MADELEINE A place near Cancun . THOMAS My , how exotic . I 've never been . MADELEINE It was supposed to be a surprise . THOMAS Was ? MADELEINE Hayley . She'ssick . THOMAS Oh no . MADELEINE she may not be able to come home for Christmas . THOMAS What ? No wonder you 're devastated . This is barbaric , if you do n't mind me saying so . It 's just like when she abandoned Conrad . She told him she needed her space . Kids these days always say that . MADELEINE We said it too : Virginia Woolfa room of our own . THOMAS But our parents understood what a room looked like . But space ? What the hell is that ? Outer space ? Inner space ? I would n't recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My Blue Heaven . " p. 25 MADELEINE Do n't hold back , Nadine . THOMAS And it 's the anniversary of Harry 's heart attack , too . Shame on Hayley . Do n't you worry , Madeleine , you can have Christmas dinner with me . MADELEINE I 'd make Conrad uncomfortable . You know he 's never really forgiven me for being the mother of the girl who drove a stake through his heart without blinking . Or so you say . THOMAS You should come over . Come on . I 'll make key lime pie . ( HARRY enters with his phonograph . He nearly bumps into NADINE , which makes MADELEINE jump . He gingerly avoids any of the boxes containing his clothes . He sits on the floor near the big box and works on the phonograph . ) MADELEINE ( as she watches HARRY with love ) No , it would upset the balance of things . It 's your family 's Christmas , not mine . And I have so much to do here . THOMAS Does it have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep staring over there . MADELEINE You mean you can see --  THOMAS Of course I can . MADELEINE But how ? p. 26 THOMAS Who could miss that big box ? MADELEINE Oh . THOMAS What 's in it ? MADELEINE An exercise machine Hayley sent me after Thanksgiving . THOMAS How thoughtful of her . She is thoughtful , even if she 's ruthless . MADELEINE Cut the profanity , Nadine . THOMAS Yes dear . MADELEINE Hayley 's just trying to survive in what 's still a man 's world . And she lost her father . And she does n't have a boyfriend . Hard not to be a little glacial when you 're lonely . THOMAS Then do n't send back her gift . MADELEINE I called UPS and they 're going to pick it up . THOMAS Are you sure it wo n't hurt her feelings ? MADELEINE Earlier you seemed to imply that she had none . THOMAS It 's okay , Madeleine , really . Conrad 's married to a wonderful woman now . He could n't be happier . MADELEINE And what about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you count ? THOMAS If my son 's happy , I 'm happy . MADELEINE Are you sure ? THOMAS Absolutely . MADELEINE I mean , is that really enough ? And what if he wakes up one day and he is n't happy ? Is that your fault because you gave him porridge instead of pancakes one Saturday morning or because you could n't put on a happy face every single day of his childhood ? THOMAS You ca n't make up you mind , can you ? MADELEINE I just do n't want the damn machine , okay ? THOMAS I 'm not talking about the exercise machine . I 'm talking about whether to live or die . MADELEINE Do n't be absurd . THOMAS I understand . I felt that way once . MADELEINE But you always find a way to let it roll off your back . You make it look so easy . I worked all my life , Nadine , and looked forward to enjoying my retirement . I just never thought that , when I got here , everybody I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOMAS Is n't that what we wanted ? Did n't we say things like , Just wait til my kids grow up . I 'm going to read a hundred books , see R-rated movies , travel , enjoy the silence . p. 28 MADELEINE You said that . THOMAS Okay , so I was n't as devoted as you , but  --  MADELEINE You sent him off to boarding school three thousand miles away when he was only twelve , Nadine . THOMAS Madeleine , no matter how loud the silence is , you ca n't check out . You hear me ? After all , who am I going to drive crazy ? MADELEINE I do want to live , but my way . I do n't want to exercise , walk on the beach and meet people , or read magazines ; I do n't want to care about the incredible art of the English language . THOMAS You know , at the beach , there 's a new seafood place with --  MADELEINE Did n't you hear me ? Does n't anybody hear me anymore ? ( walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ca n't you even hear me ? THOMAS Madeleine , why are you talking to that box ? MADELEINE He 's here . THOMAS Who ? MADELEINE Harry . THOMAS You think Harry 's here ? MADELEINE I think so . p. 29 THOMAS But that 's impossible . MADELEINE Is it ? THOMAS Is n't it ? MADELEINE yes . I guess . THOMAS Is he here or not ? MADELEINE Uh , no , of course not . I meant hishis essence , you know . THOMAS Of course . MADELEINE Of course . THOMAS Are you okay ? MADELEINE Tip-top . THOMAS Because if you think you saw  --  MADELEINE I did not say I saw  --  THOMAS You 're too smart to --  MADELEINE Shut up , Nadine , please . THOMAS " Shut up " ? To an English fanatic , that 's the equivalent of profanity . Apology , please . MADELEINE I am so tired of you coming over here and telling me how wonderful your son is and how terrible my daughter was for leaving him , what ? Fifteen years ago ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck , and you keep ramming it and ramming it against me trying to knock me down to size , trying to make me feel inconsequential , trying to remind me that life steps on you if you do n't move fast and get out of the way . I 'm out of the way , Nadine , okay ? The great English professor goes the way of the dinosaurs and you , the distinguished housewife , ends up on top . Happy ? I 'm so happy I could puke , but I do n't want to mess up my beautiful ensemble . p. 30 THOMAS ( a pause , then a choice ) There are peanuts in the cookies . I hope Hayley is n't allergic to peanuts . I think it was my housekeeper who could n't eat peanuts . You 're fine with them , are n't you ? MADELEINE Nadine , I 've learned to cope with all kinds of nuts . Good-day . THOMAS Well , I like that ! Is that how you treat your friend ? MADELEINE We 're friends ? I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend you 've got , Madeleine . MADELEINE Heavens to Betsy , has it come to that ? THOMAS Believe it . You 're going to kill yourself with grief . That 's what you 're going to do . MADELEINE Then go home and just let me get on with it , okay ? THOMAS You need to see somebody . MADELEINE ( looks at HARRY ) I am seeing someone . THOMAS You are ? MADELEINE Yes . And he 's kind and bright and sensitive , and good in bed . THOMAS Well , rub it in , why do n't you ? p. 31 MADELEINE I just took a chance , Nadine . I took a chance and it was all there , right from the first kiss . THOMAS Then I guess you do n't need my company over the holidays . ( curty ) Merry . Christmas .

HAYLEY Brilliant , Mother . MADELEINE Yes . Dazzling . Resplendent . HAYLEY Did you get my Christmas present ? MADELEINE You forgot my Christmas present . p. 32 HAYLEY Mother . It 's on its way . MADELEINE It 's three days before Christmas . With holiday mail slowdown , I 'd say my gift from you has to be classified as forgotten . HAYLEY Okay , I sent it at the last minute . Sorry .

Guitar , pottery , salsa or  --  MADELEINE Number three : Love is n't on your To Do li  --  HAYLEY Mom . ( The noise of family revelry begins in the distance . It grates on MADELEINE 'S nerves , but also makes her anxious. ) p. 33 MADELEINE Please come home . Just for one day . I 'll pay the airfare . HAYLEY What did you say , Mother ? My signal 's fading . MADELEINE For goodness sake , it 's the anniversary of your father 's death . HAYLEY Make sure you put tulips on his grave . I 'll pay for them . MADELEINE What about filial obligation ? HAYLEY " Filial obligation " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas , Hayley . HAYLEY ( a pause , then : ) Maybe you can come up for your birthday . MADELEINE I 'm sending you something at the last minute , too , okay ? Look for a box to arrive . By UPS . HAYLEY That 's sweet of you , Mother . You did n't have to . MADELEINE Somehow , I could n't help myself . ( The doorbell rings . ) MADELEINE I have to go . HAYLEY Why do you suddenly sound so agitated ? MADELEINE ( looks towards door ) It 's the UPS man . p. 34 HAYLEY So ? Let him wait . Mom , listen . I want to tell you someth  --  MADELEINE My goodness , look at him . He 's a giant . He could pick up this whole house if he wanted to . Oh , look , he 's smiling at me. ( to off-stage persona as she gives a little wave ) Hi ! Just a minute ! HAYLEY Mother . MADELEINE I 'd better go help him . Bye , Hayley . ( MADELEINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hung up on , looks at her cell phone for a moment before her spotlight blacks out . MADELEINE as she exits to the door : ) MADELEINE Do n't go away , Mr. UPS . I 'm coming . ( Off-stage , a door is heard opening then MADELEINE gasping in the manner of one whose breath has been taken away . HARRY registers all this with concern . He looks up from his work and gazes in the direction of the door . Lights cross-fade ) p. 35 Act 1 , Scene 3 Scene Three ( Lights fade up . The big box is gone . MADELEINE enters as if catatonic . Her hair and clothing are somewhat disheveled . She sits on the sofa . HARRY enters and sits on the floor beside her , tools in hand , phonograph between his legs , but not working . He , too , stares straight ahead . ) MADELEINE Sorry , Harry . ( no response ) I said I 'm sorry . Go ahead and fix the damn phonograph . I 'm sorry for hiding it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hana with you . That seventeen-mile drive always made me nauseous . You saw it , did n't you ? I could n't help it . He picked me up just to show me how strong he was and , well , I kissed the UPS man . Please accept my apology . ( takes a pill ) This will help me sleep . ( tries to expectorate the pill , but it has been consumed ) What am I doing ? Why am I taking a sleeping pill when it 's still light outside ? Why am I seducing the UPS man ? ( looks at HARRY ) Remember that Russian poet Marina Tsvetsayeva ? She said , " Motherhood is a question without an answer . " She 's right . There will never be an answer to why we have children , why we love them to death , why we argue with them , why we uphold them , why we ache for them , hope for them , why we watch them fly away and resist the urge to clip their wings . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to do with ourselves when , in the December of our lives , they want nothing to do with us. ( a pause , then : ) If I have to sit here alone on Christmas , I 'll cook myself for dinner . What happened to Madeleine Palmer , they 'll ask . She was a turkey and she got roasted . Where do I run to , Harry ? Where can I go where I do n't end up feeling old , useless , and so damn alone ? ( HARRY starts to work on his phonograph ) I have to go somewhere , Harry . Because this , this is the end of nowhere . ( She tries to touch HARRY , but is disappointed by what appears to be an invisible , impenetrable shield around him . She watches HARRY go towards the door ; he exits to the doorway. ) p. 36 MADELEINE Harry ! No . Do n't go . Harry ! ( A door is heard slamming . MADELEINE is jarred , but then stares outward . ) MADELEINE ( to herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where the hell is that window ? ( Lights cross-fade ) p. 37 Act 1 , Scene 4 Scene Four ( The beach . Sounds of lapping waves , seagulls , seals , voices . Sunset , that evening . A YOUNG WOMAN lies on the sand seemingly sleeping . A sign rests against her body . She is a frail , delicate , 20-something beauty ravaged by life on the streets . Her frame and hair color are reminiscent of HAYLEY , which causes MADELEINE to look at her as she enters . She stops briefly and then keeps going . Just as she is about to exit , the YOUNG WOMAN begins to cough and then cry quietly . MADELEINE turns to look at her and returns to her side with concern . ) MADELEINE Hello ? ( no response ; reads her sign ) " I been abandoned by my boyfriend . He took my money and fucked me over . " Okay . YOUNG WOMAN ( struggles to raise herself up on an elbow , peers ) Congratulations . You can read . Now keep it moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art ? YOUNG WOMAN ( lowering herself prone again ) Right . Performance art . Go to hell . ( begins coughing again ; it persists ) MADELEINE I 'm sorry . I never know with you young people . There was a fellow down the beach who was sitting on warm coals . Or at least they looked like warm coals . He did n't want any help , just a donation . p. 38 YOUNG WOMAN I do n't want anything . Just leave me alone , okay ? ( Gradually , the sky starts to darken , and lights fade and close in on the two women . ) MADELEINE But you have a sign . YOUNG WOMAN Because people look at it , laugh , and walk away . Nobody really reads the damn thing . Before I had it , old ladies kept asking if I was all right . I 'm peachy . Just having a bad day . MADELEINE ( gingerly , looking at the sign again ) You 're missing the verb " have " in the first sentence and saying he robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " F " word . YOUNG WOMAN Those are really important concerns for me at this stellar time in my life . Thank you . ( coughing worsens ) MADELEINE ( tries to give her money ) Here . Take this . Go home to your mother . YOUNG WOMAN ( takes the bill ) Fifty dollars . Sure . This 'll save me. ( rips it into several pieces ) It 's too late . ( more coughing ) MADELEINE You know , there are shelters where you can get help . p. 39 YOUNG WOMAN Sure , lady . And Jesus loves me , too . Feel better yet ? MADELEINE ( opens her thermos ) Want some tea ? Here , you can have the whole thermos . My daughter gave it to me . Made in Japan , solid as a rock . You can drop it on concrete and it won't --  ( The YOUNG WOMAN tosses it off stage and the sound of stainless steel crashing against rock is heard . ) YOUNG WOMAN I said it 's too late . ( The YOUNG WOMAN looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and stares out to sea . Lights get darker and tighter on the two women . ) MADELEINE Yes . It is too late . YOUNG WOMAN Later than last week . Later than his promises . MADELEINE And I ca n't restore it . Any of it . YOUNG WOMAN Yeah . ( an affirmation ) There it is . MADELEINE Tell me . Did youdid you come here to YOUNG WOMAN I came here thinking about it . Why 'd you come here ? MADELEINE To get away from Harry . p. 40 YOUNG WOMAN Your old man driving you crazy , huh . MADELEINE Something like that . YOUNG WOMAN And this is where you come ? Did n't do nothing for me . MADELEINE Did n't do anything . A double negative is n't  --  YOUNG WOMAN Take a pill , lady . MADELEINE You seem like a nice , if not angry , young woman . Can I just sit here with you and watch the sun set ? YOUNG WOMAN I 'm sick . MADELEINE I am , too . YOUNG WOMAN Then go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Tell Harry to hit the road . MADELEINE I 'm not afraid of you . YOUNG WOMAN I 'm not afraid of you either . MADELEINE What do you do when it gets dark ? YOUNG WOMAN I wait for the sun to rise . ( The YOUNG WOMAN coughs uncontrollably this time and begins to hyperventilate . MADELEINE looks around in alarm and feels helpless . The YOUNG WOMAN 'S strength begins to ebb and she seems near unconsciousness . MADELEINE looks around frantically. ) p. 41 MADELEINE Oh dear god . Help ! Help ! Somebody help , please ! ( But there is no one . MADELEINE looks at the YOUNG WOMAN and then makes a decision . She prepares to administer CPR . As she lowers her face over the YOUNG WOMAN 'S and presses her lips against hers , lights black-out. ) p. 42 Act 1 , Scene 5 Scene Five ( That night . MADELEINE sits on the sofa staring straight ahead . She turns off the white noise of an unseen television . A glass of wine is nearby . She looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights the room . HARRY enters . He is upset in a reprimanding way . He blocks the television and stares at MADELEINE . ) MADELEINE Harry ? I thought you 'd gone for good . You 're angry , I know . Do n't be . The hospital would n't keep her overnight . She was only half-conscious and they were going to send her back to the streets . The nurse even cursed at her when she vomited . As if she could help it . Do n't worry . She only has a respiratory infection . They gave her antibiotics . And a sedative . She wo n't make me sick and she is n't the murdering type . She is n't . And she 's clean now , too . I went to the shelter , okay ? You think I did n't think of that first ? I just could n't leave her there with all those strangers . Harry , I must have met her for a reason . I have to believe that . Otherwise , why did I see you just hours after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room and then all of you ? That very moment , I wanted to say , Hayley , look , look ! There 's Daddy ! He is n't completely gone . Look how beautiful he is . But she would have just said I was crazy . And maybe I am . My life was always so planned until you died . I did n't plan on that . And I did n't plan on Hayley turning into snow . And ( looking towards the bedrooms ) I did n't plan on her . ( The sound of breaking glass that of a small vase is heard off stage , startling MADELEINE . A figure emerges at the edge of the darkness in a flowing white nightgown . The effect is ghostly . MADELEINE stares at it . HARRY is mesmerized by her . The figure moves shakily into the candlelight . It is the woman from the beach . Disoriented , she stares at MADELEINE in confusion . HARRY tries to touch her , but can not . He watches her and then exits. ) p. 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are you ? MADELEINE Madeleine . Palmer . YOUNG WOMAN Where am I ? ( MADELEINE turns on the lights ; lights fade up . ) YOUNG WOMAN ( squinting from the light ) You 're the lady , the lady --  MADELEINE Who rescued you from the beach . YOUNG WOMAN Who kidnapped me . MADELEINE Okay . I can take you back if you like . Let me find my keys . YOUNG WOMAN Who were you talking to ? I heard you talking . MADELEINE Uh , I wasit was the television . YOUNG WOMAN I have n't seen TV in a long time . What were you watching ? MADELEINE A news magazine show . YOUNG WOMAN About some kind of scandal , huh ? MADELEINE Yes . Aging . YOUNG WOMAN You 're old . MADELEINE Thank you . They talked about grandmothers in Tokyo being so lonely they go to agencies that specialize in leasing family members . p. 44 YOUNG WOMAN At least then you can choose your relatives . MADELEINE What a concept . And those Liverpool lads said money ca n't buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MADELEINE I 'm not shopping . YOUNG WOMAN Good . MADELEINE But you ca n't live at the beach . YOUNG WOMAN I was doing just swell . MADELEINE Do you have a name ? YOUNG WOMAN Brown . ( sniffs her arm ) I smell funny . Like medicine , but bath oil , too . MADELEINE Do n't you remember going to the hospital ? YOUNG WOMAN ( shakes her head ) So you probably know I have n't had my rabies shot yet . MADELEINE Miss Brown , you need to go back to bed . You do n't have rabies , but you have a fever , you 're dehydrated , and you have a rash on your lower trunk . YOUNG WOMAN/MISS BROWN Criminy . Did you give me a pelvic exam , too ? MADELEINE In the morning , I 'll take you to see my doctor for a more thorough --  p. 45 BROWN Doctor ? MADELEINE Yes . Someone who is licensed to practice medicine . BROWN The key word is " practice . " Not on me . No thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Garcia 's been my physician for thirty years ; she 'll give you personal attention . BROWN I 'm touched . ( MISS BROWN gulps down MADELEINE 'S wine as she tries to stop her . She starts coughing . ) BROWN Where 's my clothes ? MADELEINE In the dryer . BROWN How far am I from the beach ? MADELEINE Miss Brown , please accept my hospitality tonight . You 'll feel better after Dr. Garcia --  BROWN Whose room is that with the eyelet canopy bed and all that shitty lace ? MADELEINE You mean " pretty " lace , I hope . BROWN That your daughter 's room ? She away at college ? MADELEINE Hayley finished college years ago . BROWN And you keep her room like that ? Like somebody 's about to take a picture of it ? p. 46 MADELEINE Never mind her room . The day bed in my studio 's comfortable . I often take naps there myself . BROWN Oh . I get it . You do n't want me in the shitty lace room . Too good for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why 'd you give me CPR ? Me , a polluted homeless girl . I could have TB or AIDS or something . MADELEINE You could . BROWN I could be the Boogey Man . MADELEINE Boogey Woman . BROWN Why are n't you afraid of me ? MADELEINE When I was six , I saw a cat get hit by a car . I put her in my wagon and brought her home ; blood , guts , and all . BROWN Meow . MADELEINE Nobody else was going to help you . You could have died . BROWN And your point ? MADELEINE You 're welcome . BROWN ( looks at a photograph ) This your daughter ? She 's got an edge to her , huh ? Like she 's been riding the New York subway too long . Jaw gets set . Permanent clench . MADELEINE She did n't used to have that clench . In fact , she used to be kind of like you . p. 47 BROWN That 's a hoot . What ? A sucker ? MADELEINE Vulnerable . BROWN I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a little tough . BROWN More fun to chew you , my dear . ( yawns ) This is her nightgown , is n't it ? You save all her stuff . ( curls up on sofa ; pulls blanket around her ) MADELEINE Do you have a first name ? BROWN ( a moment of hesitation and then : ) Berit . MADELEINE Where are you from ? MISS BROWN/BERIT Is this an interview or what ? ( MADELEINE just looks at her as if measuring her mettle ) I was born on a plane so I 'm from air space . ( starts to drift off ) MADELEINE ( tries to gently lift BERIT upward , but she jumps ) Why do n't you go back to bed ? BROWN Yeah . ( drifting ) No . ( MADELEINE can not resist fixing a stray lock of BERIT 'S hair , which causes BERIT to jump. ) p. 48 MADELEINE Sorry . BROWN What 'd you touch me for ? MADELEINE Your hair . It was falling across your face . BROWN You 're not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesbians ? You make it sound as if they 're some tribe living in exile . BROWN Exile . Yeah . I can relate . I was living in exile on the beach . MADELEINE Self-imposed , I 'm sure . BROWN Then you came along and blew your breath into me . It 's weird . Part of you 's inside of me . ( An off stage , loud buzzer is heard . BERIT jumps at the sound . ) BROWN What the hell was that ? MADELEINE The dryer . Your clothes must be dry . Shall I get them for you ? BROWN Yeah . I 'd like to go home , you know ? But I do n't have any money . You think you could lend me some ? MADELEINE You mean give you some . Besides the fifty you tore up . BROWN ( coughs ) Come on , Maddy . MADELEINE Madeleine . p. 49 BROWN You ca n't keep me here against . BROWN She 's dead , is n't she ? C'm on . Tell the truth . Nobody keeps a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADELEINE Ever heard of love ? BROWN Yes , Virginia , there really is a bankruptcy court . MADELEINE Maybe if you love someone someday , you 'll understand . BROWN My mother said I 'd let a man kill me on the inside . And that was what really killed me : that she 'd said I 'd let him , as if it was only my doing , as if he could n't possibly have made me a fool and filled my insides with maggots . Oh yeah , sure , I opened my legs . But why do people have to kill you in those moments when they could just as easily save you ? MADELEINE You feel dead ? BROWN Yeah . Bankrupt heart . Ca n't you smell the burning flesh ? MADELEINE I 'm sorry , Berit . BROWN Are you alone ? MADELEINE No. ( and then : ) Yes . p. 50 BROWN Dead husband ? MADELEINE ( looks around , which BERIT observes ) I guess . BROWN You guess ? MADELEINE Did you -- do you have someone ? BROWN What does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box or cage or something ? MADELEINE Wellyou are pregnant . BROWN What ? What the hell are you talking about ? I said I had maggots inside , not a baby . MADELEINE I think you 're pregnant . BROWN I think you 're crazy . Or wanting things for Christmas you ca n't have . MADELEINE Being pregnant implies a coupling of some nature . Surely there must be someone . Unless there 's been an immaculate conception . BROWN Do n't you love words like that ? If it is n't immaculate , is it " maculate " ? If it is n't disgruntled , is it gruntled ? I had a maculate , gruntled conception . MADELEINE So you 're educated , I see . And you admit that you 're going to have a baby . BROWN Why do you need to know anything about me ? You saved me , you 'll get me some medicine from your doctor , and I 'll be on my way and you 'll win first prize at your coffee klatch for having the best gossip of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who it is I 'm helping . BROWN Me . This girl sitting here . Flesh . Bones . Spirit . MADELEINE Okay . Where did the flesh grow up ? BROWN Where do you want me to be from ? MADELEINE I do n't know . New England ? BROWN That 's good . What else can you give me ? A mother who died in a plane crash ? A father who left home when I was five ? Creative . Especially the maculate baby bit . ( removes the nightgown to reveal a camisole undershirt and panties ) Nice stuff . Can I keep them ? Your daughter wo n't want to wear these skivvies now that I 've had them on . ( smells her arms ) Of course , I 'm not so dirty now since you bathed me . I do n't think anyone 's given me a bath since I was six years old . What 's up with you ? MADELEINE You were not clean . I washed the streets off of you . Because of the sedative  --  not from me , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What else did you do to me ? Where the hell am I anyway ? Is there a train station close by ? MADELEINE There are no trains this late at night in Del Mar. p. 52 BROWN There 's always transportation for a girl like me . MADELEINE Get help and then catch your train . BROWN You lost something and you think picking up a stray is going to fix it . Clean me up , dress me up , and  --  voila  --  a new roommate and  --  MADELEINE I do n't need a roommate . BROWN Then what do you need ? Somebody fu  --  ( catches herself ) screwed up your life , too , huh . MADELEINE " Someone " is the appropriate word to use when referring to a singular entity . " Somebody " refers to --  BROWN Shut up will you ? This is what I 'm running away from . Real life asks too much of you . Who needs it ? ( heads towards the door ) MADELEINE You go back out there and you may not make it . Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lady . You just keep moving like a bat outta hell , and hope you do n't crash into yourself coming and going . You feel sorry for me , right ? Poor little homeless girl with nowhere to go . I have news for you . Nobody has anywhere to go . Including you . Everybody 's alone , especially when they look at their family or lovers or friends and think they 're so lucky because they have somebody . The minute you start thinking that , you blink your eyes and , when you open them -- BANG -- the room is empty . Nothing but vapor and ghosts . ( HARRY enters carrying a box . MADELEINE gazes at him . BERIT follows her gaze and registers his presence as well ; immediately , a chill comes over her . She pulls the blanket closer . HARRY removes the phonograph from the box as well as several LPs . With grand gesture and joy , he sets up the phonograph to play it . He selects an album and begins to play Chopin 's " Etude in C# minor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the music , it causes a sharp and immediate reaction in BERIT , as if it has suddenly infused her with new life ; MADELEINE does not hear it . BERIT looks around to find the source of the stimuli . She makes eye contact with HARRY and the music 's volume increases , compelling BERIT to rise and begin dancing , a dance that reveals skill in modern dance . MADELEINE , mesmerized by the dance , watches in rapt silence . When the music ends , BERIT collapses from exhaustion and MADELEINE runs to her side as HARRY looks lovingly at his phonograph , picks it up , and exits. ) p. 53 MADELEINE That danceit was beautiful . What made you do that ? BROWN I read about Isadora when I was little and I had to dance . MADELEINE No , I mean right now . What made you dance right now ? BROWN Oh . The music . MADELEINE What music ? BROWN You did n't hear music ? MADELEINE No . BROWN Oh . Well , I guess it was music in my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just made it up . I mean , if you can make me up , why ca n't I make up something , too ? Do n't tell me : you always wanted your little girl to grow up and be a dancer . A ballerina . But she turned out to be a stock jockey . What else did you want ? MADELEINE Violin . BROWN What else ? Come on . You 're building me up nicely . I could learn violin , but we do n't have enough time . MADELEINE I made you a pie this morning . BROWN No kidding ? From scratch ? That 's like magic to make something out of nothing . ( The doorbell rings . BERIT peeks outside , but turns away from the window with disinterest. ) p. 54 BROWN I could sleep a little if I could sleep in the pretty eyelet room . I 'd like to go to sleep right now . ( The doorbell rings again . ) BROWN Well ? Come on . How bout it ? MADELEINE It 's my daughter 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADELEINE Well THOMAS ( off-stage ) Madeleine ! I know you 're in there ! BROWN By the way , I broke a vase in the hallway . MADELEINE Harry -- that 's my husband -- he used to fix things for me . BROWN Yeah . Everybody needs somebody to fix their stuff . ( BERIT exits quickly as the doorbell rings again . MADELEINE exits to the door and returns with NADINE . ) THOMAS So when I saw you coming home with her , I was worried because she looked so sick and frail . MADELEINE You saw me ? THOMAS And all bundled up in blankets like that , her face peeking out like an Eskimo . I hardly recognized her . MADELEINE That was five a.m. p. 55 THOMAS Well , you know I ca n't sleep . I hope it 's nothing serious . MADELEINE Uh , no . No . THOMAS Did you take her to the emergency room or something ? Why were you out so early ? MADELEINE Yes . That 's right . Her , uh , fever was too high , so we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu . THOMAS It 's going around . Terrible to be sick at Christmas . At least your girl 's at home . MADELEINE Pardon ? THOMAS It 's downright ideal for a mother to have her daughter home with her at Christmas . MADELEINE Uh , yes , yes of course . Year after year , Hayley 's home like clockwork . How 's Conrad ? He let you sneak out for a few minutes ? THOMAS Just a few MADELEINE Well , you 'd better get back before he files a missing person 's report . THOMAS You have to be missing twenty-four hours before the police will put down their donuts and do anything . MADELEINE Really ? But a lot can happen in twenty-four hours . THOMAS Like what ? Are you talking about Harry 's death again ? p. 56 MADELEINE ( sounds good to her -- she nods ) Yes . Yes of course . THOMAS Oh , Madeleine , are you feeling lonely ? Come on , you can tell me . You want to come over and have some tea ? Conrad and his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have girl talk . MADELEINE Maybe later , Nadine . THOMAS I understand . You want to be on call in case Hayley needs something . MADELEINE Yes . That 's right . I hope you have a merry , merry Christmas , Nadine . THOMAS You 're blessed , Madeleine . I mean it . You 're beautiful , smart , your daughter loves you -- and you have a new paramour . MADELEINE I never said he was new . THOMAS What ? You mean you 've been seeing him a while ? Even when Harry was still alive ? MADELEINE Nadine , I 'm really tired . THOMAS I had no idea you were so savvy . My , my , Madeleine . Can you give me a few pointers ? MADELEINE ( glances at HARRY and then ) You have to believe . THOMAS Believe in what ? p. 57 MADELEINE in the possibility of impossibility , something like that THOMAS You mean I have to be willing to take risks ? MADELEINE Yes . THOMAS That does n't sound like you , Madeleine . You 're always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THOMAS I 'll say . Promise me we 'll start our beach walks together after the first of the year . Even if we do n't meet anybody , it 's good exercise . MADELEINE Okay . Yes , yes . Whatever you say . THOMAS Okay . Good-night . I 'll be back in a couple of days with some banana bread for our Hayley . It 's good for binding . ( NADINE exits . MADELEINE , looking out of the window , watches her go . BERIT appears in an old , feminine dress . She stares at MADELEINE . Startled by her return , MADELEINE turns and is obviously caught off-guard with BERIT 'S new outfit . ) BROWN You lied . You told that lady a big fat lie . MADELEINE I did n't lie . She made assumptions . BROWN You could have set her straight . What are you going to tell her when I suddenly disappear ? p. 58 MADELEINE That you got well and went back to work . BROWN Not me . Hayley got well . MADELEINE I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this look ? I found it in her closet . Do you mind ? ( MADELEINE shakes her head ) Goody . Thanks . MADELEINE I really did n't lie . You are sick and I am mothering you . It 's more than what my real daughter will let me do for her these days . She wo n't even come home anymore . BROWN You guys have a fight or something ? MADELEINE No . There was no fight . Sure , we bickered because we 're both upset about Harry , but BROWN People grieve in different ways . Maybe her way is to be alone . MADELEINE When she was little , she 'd make up dances and sing loud . When I did n't have time to be a good audience , she 'd go into her room and barricade the door with her dresser . BROWN Creative . Maybe if you would 've been a good audience , she could 've become a ballerina . MADELEINE Berit . Tell me the truth . When you were dancingdid you hear music ? You truly seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it ? I thought you were just pretending . MADELEINE No . BROWN So you mean you also did n't see  --  MADELEINE What ? BROWN There 's always music . This time , it was Chopin . I heard Chopin . In my head I heard Chopin . MADELEINE my husband listened to Chopin whenever he was sad . BROWN My last dance was to Chopin . ( a pause , then : ) My mother was n't there . MADELEINE What did you do ? Did you barricade the door with your dresser ? BROWN No . I went on stage and kicked ass . MADELEINE I trust that means you gave it your all . BROWN Yeah . And there was nothing left . MADELEINE And then there was the fellow BROWN I call it the train wreck . MADELEINE Okay . BROWN ( a pause , then : ) In the morning , I 'm catching another train . Hope it stays on the tracks . Can you wake me up in the morning ? I 'm not a morning person . But I 've improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person either . p. 60 MADELEINE What time would you like me to wake you up ? The station 's only ten minutes away . BROWN Around nine ? No . Make that ten . MADELEINE Shall I make you breakfast ? BROWN Sure . And I want to sleep in the pretty lace room . That is , if it 's okay . I promise to keep it clean . MADELEINE Okay . BROWN Honest ? MADELEINE Hayley wo n't be needing it anytime soon . BROWN You can wash the sheets after I go . A couple of tablespoons of bleach and the germs 'll come out . MADELEINE You have to take your medicine one more time today . And , at two , I 'll wake you to get to Dr. Garcia 's by three-thirty . BROWN Okay . Will that lady be coming back ? She 's intense , man . MADELEINE Nadine ? Oh , she 's harmless , just all mouth and trousers . BROWN What 's that mean ? MADELEINE What ? Oh . My husband 's expression for someone full of ballast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to you . But she 's still managed to stay afloat . I can only hope to float like that . p. 61 BROWN She 'll see us going to the doctor . She might butt in . She 'll find out you lied . MADELEINE We 'll set a trap and bury her in the backyard . BROWN I like it . MADELEINE I hate to sound clich , but I feel as if I 've known you a hundred years . BROWN Have n't I told you a million times not to exaggerate ? ( The pair smile , nearly laugh . ) MADELEINE How did a girl like you end up on the beach ? I mean , if you could end up there , so could I. BROWN You did . MADELEINE So I did . BROWN This is n't permanent , you know . MADELEINE There is n't a relationship in this world that is , is there ? BROWN One more thing . MADELEINE Yes ? BROWN I am pregnant . How did you know ? ( Black-out . END OF ACT I. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; both are agitated . ) MADELEINE How could you ask Dr. Garcia such a question ? BROWN Because I wanted to know ! Do n't tell me you 're one of those anti-abortion holy  --  MADELEINE I believe that women have to make their own choices , but  --  BROWN That 's what I did : made a choice . MADELEINE But so abruptly . BROWN I said hello first ! MADELEINE Do you really want to do this ? BROWN Dr. Garcia gave me a referral . MADELEINE But you 're over three months along . BROWN Time enough to save her from me . MADELEINE But you do n't have to decide this now . You do n't want to go through that over the holidays . BROWN The holidays mean nothing to people who do n't have family . MADELEINE Next season , you will have family . You could , that is . Of course , it 's your choice . p. 63 BROWN ( as she crawls to the sofa and lies down ) It is n't enough that I 'm Daughter-for-a-day ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that train fare today ? Now ? ( MADELEINE pours water from a carafe and gives it to her . BERIT drinks . ) MADELEINE Look at you . You 're not ready . BROWN That 's not for you to decide . Ca n't you just give me the money and forget about me ? MADELEINE You 're feeling desperate . You 're carrying the child of a man who did n't deserve you . You know you have to make up your mind fast or you 're stuck , right ? BROWN Gee , I feel like I 'm on Oprah . MADELEINE Remember , Berit , he 's gone and good riddance . You 're here . It 's your baby now . Just give yourself a little more time to think about this . BROWN Do n't have time . MADELEINE Not a month . Just two or three more days . BROWN Ca n't think anymore . MADELEINE I tell you what . There was something I was going to do over Christmas , a surprise for my daughter . I was going to  --  BROWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift . BROWN Chocolate ? MADELEINE It 's a gift you have to go to . It ca n't come to you . BROWN You mean you 'd just give me the ticket and I could go somewhere and start all over again ? MADELEINE Well , not exactly . It 's a somewhere that involves us going together . BROWN Oh . MADELEINE On a vacation . BROWN You mean like a family vacation ? But we 're not a family . MADELEINE People will think you 're my daughter . BROWN ( thinks for a moment and then : ) Can I just have that train fare please ? At least one day I can pay that back . MADELEINE Has life gotten so bad that you ca n't even accept a gift ? BROWN I 've learned never to take anything meant for someone else . Besides my life 's a loaded gun . MADELEINE Emily Dickinson . BROWN Yeah . MADELEINE What about if we call it a birthday gift ? When is your birthday ? p. 65 BROWN What else you need to know ? My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MADELEINE A few days away and you 'll be able to make your decision with a clear head . BROWN Listen , Madeleine , you have a daughter , a real daughter , not some counterfeit creation you scavenged on the beach because you were hungry and desperate . ( continues talking through MADELEINE 'S speech : ) MADELEINE ( overlapping ) Do n't flatter yourself . I 'm not hungry or desperate --  BROWN ( overlapping , ) You know another reason why animals scavenge , do n't you ? Because there 's something painful inside of them , something that hurts so bad they ca n't breathe right until they get it out . Sure , you resuscitated me and I 'm so alive now that it aches . See , when you 're dead , all that real crap like having to pay the bills , eating , reading magazines on the toilet , having a baby -- it all goes like diarrhea . But because you breathed life back into me , all that crap came back , too . I 'm so full of it I could puke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you think I need you . What happens when I do n't need you anymore ? I 'm not a very good vessel ; just ask her . ( points to womb ) p. 66 MADELEINE Do n't you even want to know where we would go ? BROWN Do n't you even wonder if I 'm a thief or an axe murderer ? Meow . I mean , did that stray cat get up and just walk away or did it claw some of your furniture and shit on your carpet on its way out ? MADELEINE It died . BROWN Oh . MADELEINE Do n't you want to go somewhere ? BROWN I 've never been anywhere . MADELEINE What about Tulum ? BROWN What ? Speak English . MADELEINE I ca n't . It 's Spanish . Let 's go to Tulum . Just for three days . BROWN Sounds like medicine : Tulum . Tulum , Tulum . ( The phone rings . MADELEINE answers it . ) MADELEINE Hello ? ( HAYLEY appears in a down stage spotlight on her cell phone . She wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhausted . ) HAYLEY ( speaking outward ) Hi Dr. Palmer . MADELEINE You sound terrible . p. 67 HAYLEY You hear me say a couple of words and you can issue a diagnosis . You must be my mother or something . MADELEINE You sound sad . HAYLEY Mom , it turns out I may be able to sneak away for a couple of days the week between Christmas and New Year 's . Can I still have that pie ? MADELEINE I beg your pardon ? HAYLEY Is my signal fading ? Pie . You know . A real pie . MADELEINE No . I mean , I have plans . HAYLEY Plans ? MADELEINE With Nadine . HAYLEY But you detest Nadine . MADELEINE I do n't detest Nadine . We have a lot in common . HAYLEY Like what ? MADELEINE We 're both old . HAYLEY I 'll just come home and rest , and you and Nadine can do your thing . MADELEINE We really need the whole house . HAYLEY Mom , do you know how weird that sounds ? Like you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're not going to make me talk about my sex life . So leave off . p. 68 HAYLEY Stop it , Mom . I 'm hurting . I feel like I ca n't breathe . MADELEINE What happened , Hayley ? HAYLEY He chose someone else , Mom . MADELEINE You mean Rafael ? HAYLEY No . My boss . He bypassed me for a husky pup boy scout . MADELEINE I 'm sorry , honey . HAYLEY someone else chose someone else , too . MADELEINE What ? No , it 's not like that , Hayley . HAYLEY What ? What are you talking about ? MADELEINE What are you talking about ? HAYLEY My lover . My lover chose someone else , too . MADELEINE Oh . That 's terrible . But was n't it just sex anyway ? HAYLEY Mom , honestly . Is anything ever really just sex ? I mean with all of this progress , are we human or just troglodytes when it comes to how we relate to each other ? MADELEINE I 'm sorry , but you never even told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she walked out on me , Mother . p. 69 MADELEINE She ? HAYLEY Merry Christmas . Tell Nadine that I loved Conrad , but he just did n't make me see stars . Is it too much to ask to want to see stars with the person you 're going to spend the rest of your life with ? I 'm not coming home , Mother . I do n't know the way . Ciao . ( HAYLEY exits ; her light blacks out . ) MADELEINE She ? BROWN What the hell happened ? MADELEINE Hayley said she walked . BROWN People walk in San Francisco , do n't they ? MADELEINE No . She said she walked out on her . My daughter was seeing a woman . BROWN It 's a choice . Maybe a better one given the state of the alternative . MADELEINE Okay , yes , but something 's wrong . Something 's terribly wrong . I 've never heard her like this . Is that what it was like for you when you checked out and went to the beach ? BROWN You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were ready to check out , too . MADELEINE I have to go to her . BROWN You have to let her go . p. 70 MADELEINE At a time like this , where else can she go but to her mother ? BROWN She left you alone on Christmas . MADELEINE Maybe I left her alone first . She was so close to her father . She cried so hard at his funeral . She wanted me to hold her , but I was n't there . I mean , I was n't present . I was up in the clouds trying to keep Harry from going . Since then , Hayley 's been like snow . BROWN You have a right to be in the clouds , if that 's what you need to get by . You have a right to be anywhere you like : here , the beach , Tulum . Tulum , right ? Did I pronounce it correctly ? Where is Tulum anyway ? MADELEINE Near Cancun , but not so crowded and crazy . BROWN Let 's go . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like high drama . BROWN That 's right . And we 'll be anonymous . And we 'll come back refreshed . And I 'll go to the train station and you 'll come home and call Hayley . If that 's your choice . We each get to choose how to live our lives , right ? MADELEINE All right . Let 's go now . Before we change our minds . BROWN Yeah . p. 71 MADELEINE Uh-huh . Okay . Yes . We 'll be there for Christmas Eve . BROWN Christmas in Tulum . Wow . MADELEINE ( tries to gather her wits ) She ( Lights cross-fade ) p. 72 Act 2 , Scene 2 Scene Two ( Down stage lights illuminate a charming cafe on the plazita in Tulum near midnight represented by table , chairs , candles , flowers , sparkling stars , and the sounds of the plazita : children at play , Spanish guitars playing Christmas songs , etc . BERIT and MADELEINE have just completed dinner . Hot , after-dinner beverages steam on the table . ) BROWN Look at how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should n't they be happy ? BROWN Christmas does n't guarantee happiness . Look at you . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean  --  MADELEINE It 's okay . BROWN It 's understandable with Harry and Hayley and all MADELEINE No . This is a good Christmas . It is . BROWN Do you miss her ? MADELEINE Yes . BROWN Do you miss him ? MADELEINE Desperately . BROWN You know , you have to let him go , too . MADELEINE You mean like turning off a radio ? Sure . I can do that . Simple . p. 73 BROWN Trust me . Hold onto the dead and they 'll drag you right across the great divide with them . Before , I was holding on to something that was n't really mine and it was making me disappear . I 'm surprised you even saw me . I was sure I was invisible . ( a pause ) You were hard to see , too . You were becoming invisible . But I can see you now . You 're beautiful . MADELEINE Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beauty . Madeleine , do you know what it 's like to be just a couple of grand from ruin ? You probably do n't . I mean , I was n't born poor . I went to a good school , worked at a coffee bar , lived healthy , believed in love . I tried to hold onto it , but it was like gulping for air as water floods your lungs . I mean , he was so much . Too much . I became poor  --  in health and spirit  --  and just two thousand dollars away from staying afloat . MADELEINE And there was no one you could ask for help ? BROWN Slip below sea level in this society and you get to sink all by your lonesome . Believe it . MADELEINE But I found you . BROWN Because you were below sea level , too . That 's why you could see me . MADELEINE Do you still need that money ? p. 74 BROWN I do n't know . MADELEINE Getting land legs back ca n't possibly be cheap  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thank you . My turn now . MADELEINE You 're welcome . ( Church bells indicate it is midnight . The sounds of the children 's mirth escalates . ) BROWN Wow . Look at them scrambling to hit the piata . MADELEINE Go over there and take a whack . BROWN I never hit a piata in my life . MADELEINE All the more reason . Take a chance . ( BERIT looks at MADELEINE for reassurance . Giddy with a child-like excitement , BERIT runs off-stage . The sounds of mirth and piata-play escalate as MADELEINE observes with enjoyment . Loud shouts are heard along with the sound of the piata cracking , candy flying , and children clambering . Breathless , BERIT returns with handfuls of candy . ) BROWN Look ! Look at what I got for us ! ( places it in front of MADELEINE like a treasure ) What kind do you like ? You choose first . MADELEINE No . You choose . ( BERIT shakes her head ; MADELEINE chooses ) Ummm . Very tasty . Thank you . p. 75 BROWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muchas gracias . This is the best meal I 've ever had in my life , the best candy , ( meaning MADELEINE ) the most beautiful place . MADELEINE ( removes the candy from her mouth , balls it up in a napkin ) Do n't thank me . BROWN Why not ? MADELEINE Well , because I did n't really do anything . BROWN ( a pause , then : ) But still MADELEINE You saved me . BROWN ( a pause then ) That 's what Dr. Garcia said . MADELEINE She did ? BROWN Well yeah . Kind of . She said I could be good medicine for you . MADELEINE And what did you say ? BROWN It does n't bear repeating . I felt differently then . I 'll call her before I go and apologize for my use of the vernacular . ( on MADELEINE 'S reaction ) What ? What 's the matter ? Oh . The going part . This is n't my life , Madeleine . It 's just kind of showed me the way back to my real life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just like you . You have to get up every morning and make each day happen , make it count for something . p. 76 MADELEINE Getting dressed is challenging enough . BROWN But you brought me home and made me pie . And you came to Tulum . MADELEINE And I 'll go home again and you 'll leave . Just like Harry and Hayley and even the UPS man . BROWN But we all come back . Hayley 'll be back . And Harry , well ( gives MADELEINE a wise look ) I know he 's still around . MADELEINE What do you mean ? BROWN Come on . I know . MADELEINE Really ? BROWN Yeah . MADELEINE How ? BROWN I do n't know , but I know . MADELEINE But Hayley ca n't see him . BROWN She probably does n't want to . So you can see him ? MADELEINE Okay . Fine . I confess . BROWN Wow . MADELEINE You think I 'm crazy ? BROWN I can sense him , but I ca n't see him . MADELEINE Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such things . p. 77 BROWN Sensible people have little imagination . MADELEINE You heard his music . BROWN Yes . I was afraid to tell you . How long has he been here ? MADELEINE He comes and goes . At first , it was jsut a flash of light here , a fleeting shadow there . Then he was all there . BROWN Just do n't sleep with him . Sleep with a ghost and you 're a goner . MADELEINE But what a lover he was . And he never needed Viagra . BROWN Really ? MADELEINE Honest to goodness . BROWN Geez . And I thought it was all over after thirty . ( yawns ) MADELEINE Come on . You need sleep . BROWN This cinnamon cocoa 's so good . Everything 's so good . MADELEINE Yes . Yes it is. ( looks in her purse , grows confused ) BROWN What 's the matter ? MADELEINE I ca n't find the hotel key . BROWN Check your pockets . p. 78 MADELEINE ( checks ) No. ( starts searching herself aimlessly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeleine . They can let us in . MADELEINE But it 's not like me . I 'm not a key loser . I 'm not a loser . BROWN Take a deep breath , okay ? Sit down for a minute . MADELEINE ( sits , but immediately shoots back up ) Oh my god . I just remembered . I left the key at the front desk . I always leave the key at the front desk . Harry did things that way . How could I forget ? BROWN ( links arms with MADELEINE ) Because you have a life to make happen . You 're too busy to remember a stupid key . What have you done in the last week ? Survived your neighbor , saved a fool , gotten through the anniversary of your husband 's death ; and gone to Tulum to gather amethysts , explore ruins , and drink cinnamon cocoa . To hell with keys , okay ? MADELEINE Okay . But what if I start forgetting other things ? BROWN I think you 're a survivor . MADELEINE I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? MADELEINE Home . Yes . Home . ( They exit arm in arm as lights cross-fade ) p. 79 Act 2 , Scene 3 Scene Three ( The next day . Lights fade up on MADELEINE 'S sunlit home . A door is heard unlocking . Enter HAYLEY dressed in casual , old clothes and sans make-up with her hair in two pigtails . She has a carry-on suitcase with her . ) HAYLEY Mom ? I 'm home . Mom ? ( exits to other part of house ; a gasp is heard and then , O.S. ) What the hell . ( re-enters just as the doorbell rings ) THOMAS ( O.S. ) Hello ! Madeleine , you left the door open ! ( enters with a wrapped loaf of banana bread ) HAYLEY It 's just me , Nadine . THOMAS Where 's your mother ? HAYLEY I thought she was with you . THOMAS But she said she might go away with you . HAYLEY With me ? THOMAS Hayley , pardon me for saying so , but you look absolutely awful . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOMAS Did it turn out to be a flu ? I brought you banana bread to bind you . p. 80 HAYLEY I do n't have the flu . I have n't had the flu in a long time . THOMAS What was it then ? HAYLEY ( a view of her life ) I have n't had anything in a long time . THOMAS But you had something before . HAYLEY ( again , a life view ) Yes . At some point , I did . THOMAS You think your mother went round the bend or something and wandered off ? HAYLEY Nadine , you know my meticulous mother would n't wander off . She 'd make an appointment first . THOMAS It 's just that the other day she was talking to a big box . ( HARRY steps out from behind the box and gazes at HAYLEY . ) HAYLEY Really ? THOMAS Like it was a long lost friend . HAYLEY Did she call it Harry ? THOMAS Not yet . HAYLEY Has she seen Dr. Garcia lately ? THOMAS Did n't you two go see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just got here from San Francisco . THOMAS You mean you left and came back ? HAYLEY I just got here now . THOMAS I 'm confused . I was here four days ago and you were here . HAYLEY I have n't been here since Thanksgiving , Nadine . THOMAS ( absorbs this with fear that she might be loopy ) Okay , well , I 've got to go . Give your mother my regards . Happy new year . ( rushes off ) ( HAYLEY surveys the room with new curiosity . She exits to the other part of the house with a sense of purpose . HARRY follows her , as if wanting to explain things to her . Momentarily , MADELEINE enters with a tan and two small suitcases . She seems rejuvenated . She puts down the suitcases and is about to exit outdoors again when HAYLEY , looking even more confused , reenters . HARRY still shadows her . His appearance makes MADELEINE apprehensive . She motions for him to move away from HAYLEY , but he does not . HAYLEY observes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HAYLEY Where have you been , Mom ? p. 82 MADELEINE Uh , uh . To Tulum . HAYLEY Really ? MADELEINE Uh . Yes . HAYLEY There 's supposed to be Mayan ruins there from the tenth century . MADELEINE Yes . HAYLEY You spent Christmas there ? MADELEINE Yes . Yes indeed . I had Christmas dinner at a place called Don Cafeto 's with beautiful candles and the sound of the sea in the background . HAYLEY I see . I 've only read about it . Was n't I the one who --  MADELEINE Happy new year , dear . HAYLEY Mother ? What did you do to my room ? MADELEINE You said to change it . I started changing it . HAYLEY But someone 's stuff is all over the place . Did you find a boarder already ? MADELEINE ( a pause and then : ) Yes . A student . ( her attention is riveted on something outdoors ; she takes a step towards the door ) HAYLEY Where are you going ? MADELEINE To get my things . p. 83 HAYLEY Want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need any help . ( BERIT enters , almost colliding into MADELEINE . BERIT has just awakened and looks it ; there is a frailty about her . ) BROWN I got tired of waiting . ( HAYLEY is startled by her presence . BERIT , in mid-yawn , stops in full assessment of the situation as she see HAYLEY . HARRY shakes his head in dismay and exits . He takes a few of his clothes with him ; only MADELEINE observes . ) HAYLEY Hello . BROWN Hello . MADELEINE Hayley , this is Berit Brown . Berit , this is Hayley Palmer . BROWN So you 're Hayley . HAYLEY Yes . BROWN Hayley her daughter . HAYLEY Uh-huh . The one and only . BROWN You do n't look like a stockbroker . HAYLEY I 'm an investment executive . BROWN I expected you to look older . HAYLEY And you are ? MADELEINE I told you . Berit . It means splendid in the Celtic language . p. 84 HAYLEY Splendid . So you 're renting my old room . BROWN Uh . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much is my mother charging you ? BROWN ( simultaneously ) Two hundred . MADELEINE ( simultaneously ) Five hundred . MADELEINE She did n't count the food . Room and board , right ? BROWN Yeah . Room and board . Uh , with room and board , it 's five hundred . HAYLEY That 's decent . I 'm proud of you for finding a boarder so quickly , Mother . It 's a sign you 're feeling better . MADELEINE Yes . BROWN Definitely . HAYLEY So how did you two meet ? BROWN ( simultaneously ) Through an ad . MADELEINE ( simultaneously ) Through friends . HAYLEY Well , which is it ? Through friends , Mother ? Funny . I 've never heard you mention a Berit before . I 'd remember a name like Berit. p. 85 BROWN I 'm a ( looks at MADELEINE to finish it ) MADELEINE Student . HAYLEY Yes , Mother , you already said that . What school do you go to ? BROWN Julliard . HAYLEY That 's in New York , you know . BROWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . And where do you go now ? The school of hard knocks ? BROWN Yeah , I 'm at the top of my class in the school of hard knocks . HAYLEY No shit , Sherlock . BROWN ( on her toes ) Keep digging , Watson . It 's expensive , okay ? You probably never even been there except for some middle-class weekend excursion into the lower depths . I mean , what the hell is this ? An interview ? A proctology exam ? Do n't ask me to bend over ; I already went to the doctor . MADELEINE ( displays a large rock ) Uh , look ! Look what we found in Tulum ! On the side of the road , just lying there . We think it 's amethyst . Do you think it 's real ? HAYLEY What 's going on , Mom ? p. 86 MADELEINE Well , there was no sign telling us not to pick up the rocks , so we did . HAYLEY I mean , she 's not renting . You did n't meet her through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gotten your story straight before I came home . Why the subterfuge , Mom ? MADELEINE would you like a rock ? There 's a few more out in the car . HAYLEY I ca n't breathe . MADELEINE I I thought you were too busy to come visit . HAYLEY I told you . Were n't you listening to me ? Things change . It was n't enough that Daddy died and I lost you to your own depression . No . It had to be the job , too . And then Sloane . MADELEINE Sloane ? HAYLEY My whole life came crashing down on me like a pack of clawing cougars . MADELEINE Who is Sloane ? Is she  --  HAYLEY I 'm disposable , Mother . Like rotten meat . MADELEINE She left you . This Sloane . HAYLEY Yeah . MADELEINE I 'm sorry . HAYLEY No . It bugs you . Liberalism has a border line called My Front Door , right ? p. 87 MADELEINE Wait a minute , wait a minute . Are you ashamed of you ? Because I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could have spoiled her and endeared you to her . HAYLEY See ? I 'm never good enough . Even you think I need help to make the grade . MADELEINE What I mean is , Sloane could n't be too happy if she thought that , deep down inside , you were ashamed of her . BROWN Right . HAYLEY Shut up . BROWN Your mom understands , you know . HAYLEY What does she understand ? MADELEINE You want some tea , honey ? I 've got P.G . Tips . It 'll make you feel better . It always did when Daddy made it for you with sugar and cream . HAYLEY I was n't ashamed of her , Mom . I was only ashamed of me . I mean , people lose their parents every day and somehow they survive . Somehow they can be gracious , even cheerful again . I feel like I 'm **36;1631;TOOLONG . MADELEINE It 's okay , sweetie . It 's your armor . The edges will soften . HAYLEY I 've got so much edge that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 88 MADELEINE Sloane . I picture a reserved brunette who never uses contractions and looks good in red lipstick . HAYLEY That she does . She did . BROWN You know , it 's okay that you 're yelling at me . Go ahead and take it all out on me , everything you lost , everything that hurts . I 'm good like that . But do n't blame your mother . She was just looking for a vessel , just like the rest of us . We do n't know we are , we do n't think we are , and we never say we are ; but we are . You can have your room back . HAYLEY Are you leaving ? BROWN ( looks at MADELEINE ) I can sleep in the study . It 's no big deal . HAYLEY It is a big deal . MADELEINE She would n't be here if I did n't want her to be here . HAYLEY You 've known her for two seconds and you trust her . MADELEINE As a matter of fact , I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean , is she moving in permanently ? BROWN I 'm just passing through , okay ? MADELEINE But do you really know where you 're going , Berit ? Do you have somewhere to go ? p. 89 BROWN I I  --  HAYLEY You do n't have to answer that . None of us really know the answer to that . MADELEINE The trip to Tulum it was going to be a surprise for you . For Christmas . HAYLEY Really ? MADELEINE But since you were n't available , I took Berit . HAYLEY It was n't just work it was Sloane , too . MADELEINE I thought so . HAYLEY She was upset because I had n't told you about us . I stayed to try to fix things with her . MADELEINE I had to go somewhere , Hayley . I had to stop looking at the evergreens outside our window and see other things , other places . Affirmations . BROWN ( a realization for herself and MADELEINE ) We had a nice time in Tulum. ( to HAYLEY ) It was good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Tulum . I told you right away and  --  MADELEINE Actually , Dr. Garcia first told me about Tulum. p. 90 HAYLEY But I gave you the article . MADELEINE Yes , yes you did . And it was just like you said . On Christmas Eve , children struck piatas in the plazita and church bells rang out at midnight . HAYLEY ( a pause as she studies BERIT ) I see you like my clothes , too . You 're dressing like me. ( to MADELEINE ) Did you tell her to put that on ? BROWN And you 're dressing like me . HAYLEY I ca n't try to dress like you because I have no idea who you even are . But if this is dressing like you , then I 'd say you 're someone who 's got the blues , and bad . BROWN Right . And what else do we have in common ? HAYLEY Go to hell . BROWN Sure . Scoot over and make room for me . HAYLEY Fuck you . BROWN Better fill in your outline real fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , girls , please . BROWN ( to HAYLEY ) Boy , you really are a piece of work . p. 91 HAYLEY Is that what you told her , Mom ? MADELEINE No , I --  HAYLEY Tell her to go . I 'm home and I need my room . I need to get back on my feet . MADELEINE But she has nowhere to go . HAYLEY Well , take a number and get in line , Miss Brown . MADELEINE And she 's pregnant , too . HAYLEY Great . MADELEINE Hayley . HAYLEY It 's not my fault that somebody knocked her up . BROWN You mean someone . Somebody implies more than one person . HAYLEY Gee , thanks , Professor . ( All three women grow quiet . ) MADELEINE Shall I make us some tea then ? HAYLEY ( a commentary ) " Us . " Brilliant . MADELEINE Does someone want to help ? ( Both young women move to do so : ) BROWN Sure . HAYLEY ( simultaneously with BERIT 'S line ) I will . p. 92 MADELEINE Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) Ca n't you ? BROWN Somehow , I do n't think it 's going to taste very good if we do . MADELEINE We have to think positively . Is n't that what you said , Hayley ? BROWN Hayley if you want to know the truth your mother found me on the beach . HAYLEY She what ? BROWN I was sick and she resuscitated me . HAYLEY You mean she gave you CPR ? On the mouth ? BROWN That 's the traditional orifice for it . HAYLEY Mother ! How could you ! You could get a disease ! She could be sick . MADELEINE She 's not sick anymore . Dr. Garcia said --  HAYLEY Okay . Fine . I understand . MADELEINE Do you ? HAYLEY I 'm home now and I 'm going to stay . For a while . MADELEINE But what about your job ? HAYLEY I 'm taking some sick days . p. 93 MADELEINE You ? Sick days ? HAYLEY That 's what sick people do . They take sick days . And I 'm sick of never taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect . I 'm sick of being a corporate Nazi . I 'm sick of saying hello to people in the hall who smile at me as if they 're imagining my funeral . I 'm sick of pouring my heart into love only to find everything 's going into a bucket with a hole in it . ( studies MADELEINE and BERIT ) I 'm sick of thinking there 's a safe place and finding out there is n't . MADELEINE Hayley , she just needs my help , she needs --  HAYLEY It 's okay . It 's okay . How stupid I must look to come crawling back here when the rest of the world does n't want me , hoping we 'll be okay even though you probably need a leave of absence from being my mother just as much as I need a leave of absence from being your daughter . ( a pause ) It 's really beautiful in San Francisco right now . Driving in from the airport when you come over that crest on the 101 , the city at sunset , gleaming like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , you want it to be . I have to go back to feed my new cat . It is n't real of course . It 's one of those robotic ones for people who do n't have time for real stuff ; you know the sob story . But the frigging feline has a battery and it meows when it gets hungry and the neighbors 'll be vexed . Better go back . Do n't know what I was thinking . ( hugs MADELEINE ) Sorry , Mom . I 'm glad to see that you 're not having a bad day anymore . I do n't want to be the cause of you having another one . The bad days are over , right ? All over . Cheers . ( to BERIT ) The north window in my room -- your room -- it jams three-quarters of the way up . But it can fall back down again in a snap . Prop it with a book . ( HAYLEY suppresses tears and walks outdoors . A light fades up down stage , representing the yard , into which she retreats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 94 BROWN Let her go . MADELEINE Never been able to do that . BROWN She let you go . MADELEINE Daughters get to do that with their mothers . BROWN Maybe when we 're little . No , maybe not even then . But Hayley 's a big girl . She 'll get a new job , a new girlfriend --  MADELEINE A new mother ? BROWN ( a pause , then : ) I did . MADELEINE Did you ? Really ? BROWN I 'll stay , Madeleine . For as long as you want me to . I do n't have a job to run off to or any city or pet I 'm in love with . I just have you and ( points to her belly ) this . Hayley will be okay . She 's just tied in a knot right now . I know . I 've been there . MADELEINE You 've been a lot of places . BROWN But I 'd never really arrived before . I 'd never really unpacked . ( MADELEINE contemplates this for a moment and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside , MADELEINE slows down when she sees HAYLEY and cautiously enters her light . HAYLEY turns away from her. ) p. 95 MADELEINE Come back inside , honey . ( HAYLEY mumbles something under her breath which creates alarm in MADELEINE . ) MADELEINE Hayley ? What did you just say ? HAYLEY ( under her breath ) Nothing . MADELEINE I heard you . HAYLEY Then why ask me to repeat it ? MADELEINE You said you were going to kill me . HAYLEY ( turns sharply toward her mother ) I did not say I was going to kill you . MADELEINE Yes you did . HAYLEY I said I could kill you . As in the thought of it flew through my head . As in a figure of speech . MADELEINE But you said to rent out your room . HAYLEY I thought you 'd take out an ad , interview some people , perhaps even get some references . This is like picking somebody  --  someone  --  up in a bar . MADELEINE I was depressed . You said it yourself . Grieving . Crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything anymore . HAYLEY Boy , when you put your bad days behind you , you go all out and fast . p. 96 MADELEINE Is n't that what you told me to do ? Get rid of this , get rid of that ? HAYLEY ( turns and looks at her ) But I never said to get rid of me . MADELEINE I 'm not getting rid of you , sweetie . I could never do that . HAYLEY But you have . You 've replaced me , Mother . She is n't really a boarder . She 's a ( searches for the word ) a substitute . MADELEINE Listen to what you 're saying . After all , I 'm your mother . You 're depressed . HAYLEY I 'm not depressed . I 'm just having a bad day . ( a pause and then ) And I deserve it . MADELEINE Oh Hayley . No . No . HAYLEY what do I want that I can still have ? MADELEINE I 'll always be your mother . This will always be your home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry that I could n't be there for you in the way that you needed because , you see , I was n't there either . I mean , he died and I just caved in . A piece of me left with him . I think I just came back . You come back , too , baby . Come on back and have some tea with me. p. 97 HAYLEY Look at her staring at me . She 's on the inside where it 's warm , and I 'm standing here on the outside freezing my ass off . MADELEINE You come inside , too . It 's a big house . HAYLEY It 's not that big . MADELEINE Hayley , it 's okay to hurt . It 's okay to grieve -- about Daddy , about your girlfriend , about your job . HAYLEY I 'm fine , Mother . MADELEINE Okay . Are you going back to San Francisco now ? HAYLEY We 're having unusually good weather for this time of year . MADELEINE Do n't shut me out , Hayley . HAYLEY Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to go to . ( HAYLEY turns her back on MADELEINE who gives up and returns to the house . She re-enters and studies BERIT who continues to stare out of the window . MADELEINE sits on the sofa . HAYLEY moves closer to the house as BERIT observes . ) BROWN Did you always want to be a mother ? MADELEINE ( surprised by the question and then : ) There was a time when I did n't want to share Harry with anybody . ( HAYLEY has arrived at the window and she and BERIT gaze at one another. ) p. 98 MADELEINE But then Hayley was born and I became a mother in spite of myself . BROWN Did you resent her ? MADELEINE Just like you , I thought about ending the pregnancy before Harry noticed . In the early years , when it was really difficult , I would look at her sometimes and say to myself , " I wish she 'd never been born . " ( HAYLEY absorbs this remark with astonishment and pain . She moves away and then exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) MADELEINE But I came to my senses because there was my beautiful little girl and I loved her so much , in a different way than the way I loved Harry . Because even though Harry was so much a part of me , Hayley and I were joined by blood . It was an incredible feeling that I could n't get over . ( HAYLEY , in tears , reappears being led by an indignant NADINE . They enter the house , startling MADELEINE . ) MADELEINE Hayley ! What 's wrong ? ( MADELEINE tries to embrace HAYLEY , but she pulls away . NADINE embraces HAYLEY instead , which confounds MADELEINE . ) MADELEINE What the hell is going on ? THOMAS First you pick up some homeless girl and try to pass her off as your golden daughter and , frankly , if you ask me , she ca n't hold a candle to our Hayley . Then you throw Hayley out and have the nerve to tell her that you wish she 'd never been born p. 99 MADELEINE I did n't say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard you . MADELEINE But I did n't mean it like that . THOMAS How else can one mean something like that ? BROWN She was talking to me . THOMAS I 'm not talking to you so kindly do not address me , waif . MADELEINE Hayley , I did n't mean that I did n't want you . I only meant that I did n't know how to be a mother . HAYLEY But you were the best mother . MADELEINE No . Mothering you made me remember how wonderfully my mother had taken care of me . I knew I could never be that good . I just wanted to give up and go back to being merely Harry Palmer 's beloved wife . That was easy . I knew how to do that because we were meant to be together . HAYLEY Are n't we meant to be together , too , Mom ? MADELEINE Yes . But does that mean I ca n't love anybody else ? You love other people . I 'm trying to learn . HAYLEY Mom I 'm depressed . THOMAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 100 HAYLEY I 've been depressed for a long time and it got worse this week . MADELEINE It 's brave of you to finally say it aloud , Hayley . HAYLEY Remember how Daddy always said he wanted to go back to Big Sur like when I was little . " Hey-hey-Hayley-bun , " he 'd say , " let 's go back to Big Sur-sur-sur. " ( collects herself ) I 'm just going to get a few things . Excuse me. ( exits to bedrooms ) THOMAS Madeleine , do n't let your real life walk out on you . It never comes back . BROWN Uh , I 'll just go and get our other bags , Madeleine . I 'll be right back . MADELEINE Let me help you , Berit . BROWN It 's okay , Madeleine . I can take care of it . I really can . MADELEINE No , Berit . Please . Nadine , can you get us some tea ? THOMAS Uh , yes . Certainly , certainly . ( exits to house ) MADELEINE I know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . MADELEINE You do n't have to do it now . p. 101 BROWN But I can do it ; that is , I 'm able to do it . And that 's something . Madeleine , may I please call you Maddy ? I always wanted to have a friend named Maddy . MADELEINE Yes . Yes you may . BROWN Maddy , now I can stand up without falling down . I can float on choppy water . MADELEINE So where will you " float " ? BROWN On a train . A real one this time . MADELEINE Destination ? BROWN I can go home now . ( a pause , then ) I have n't seen my mother in a year . Maybe she 's ready to know I 'm having a baby ( MADELEINE takes a wad of traveler 's checks from her purse and tries to put them in BERIT 'S hands , but BERIT refuses them . ) MADELEINE Please . They 're all traveler 's checks . Enough to keep you afloat . BROWN I ca n't . MADELEINE Take it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) BROWN I promise I 'll pay you back . MADELEINE And I only hope I can pay you back one day , too . ( She hugs MADELEINE who hugs her back. ) p. 102 BROWN Let me get those bags . ( BERIT exits to the yard and vanishes . HAYLEY re-enters with her suitcase . She picks up the purple rock . ) HAYLEY You think it 's real amethyst or some kind of amethyst-looking quartz ? MADELEINE Who decided that diamonds would be more valuable than , say , lemon quartz ? A geologist long ago ? A jeweler in ancient Greece ? Who decides what is real and what is fake ? And is fake necessarily bad ? HAYLEY If you want it to be amethyst , just tell people it is and they 'll believe you . But if you want real amethyst then --  MADELEINE Hayley , why did n't you tell me the truth ? HAYLEY Because you wanted to believe I was your heterosexual golden girl . But , the truth is , I 'm not golden and , at the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved that woman . Since Daddy died , she 's the only thing that 's kept me human . I loved Sloane . MADELEINE Then I wish I had known her . HAYLEY Someday , I hope you really know me . And I hope I really know you . Knowing someone never ends . It 's a constant education , do n't you think ? MADELEINE Well , I 'm a firm advocate of higher education . I 'm going to try harder . Will you ? p. 103 HAYLEY Yes , Mother . But I 'm not ready . Count me as enrolled , but not fully present . Yet . MADELEINE Okay . Does that mean you 're leaving ? HAYLEY I have to go home , Mother . I ca n't run here trying to solve every crisis of my life . I have to go back to my own house and look in the mirror and start there . ( NADINE re-enters with tea . Awaiting instruction , she stands looking from one woman to the other . ) THOMAS Well ? MADELEINE Hayley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . THOMAS We deserve something a little stronger than that . I 've got brandy at home . HAYLEY No thanks . I think I need all my wits about me. ( a pause , then : ) Tell me , Mom . With Daddy , did you always feel safe ? MADELEINE Yes . THOMAS Madeleine . MADELEINE No . No , you 're right . There were many times when I did n't . ( HARRY , resigned to what MADELEINE has said , enters . ) HAYLEY Really ? MADELEINE Do n't get me wrong . I loved your father , honey , but he was n't perfect . And neither was I. p. 104 HAYLEY But everything always seemed so ideal . You two were so close that I felt like you forgot I was there sometimes . MADELEINE No , Hayley . I could never forget you . HAYLEY But with Daddy did n't you at least feel like you belonged ? That you were part of something genuine and lasting and that made life count ? MADELEINE Yes . Of that I 'm absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinct . THOMAS I hope not . HAYLEY ( a pause , then : ) Good-bye , Mom . Good-bye , Nadine . You both take care . Of yourselves and of each other . THOMAS When will we see you again , Hayley ? Easter ? HAYLEY When I was a little girl , I loved getting a new frock every Easter and wearing it to church with my bonnet clutched in my hand . I 'll call you , Mother . ( HAYLEY exits outdoors , passing HARRY who looks at her with paternal longing and affection . HAYLEY exits off stage . HARRY gazes at MADELEINE expectantly . She stares at and then looks in the direction that HAYLEY exited . HARRY sits on the sofa and starts to nod out during the scene. ) p. 105 MADELEINE I was going to bake her a blueberry pie . THOMAS You bake from scratch , do n't you ? I do n't . MADELEINE I know . THOMAS You do ? MADELEINE Sure . THOMAS Why did n't you call me on it ? MADELEINE What for ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miserable ? Oh no . I hate to cook . I hate the raw eggs , slimy raw meats , all of it . No offense , but I just do n't find cooking interesting . MADELEINE None taken . But then why the pretense ? THOMAS You 're a tough act to follow with your career and the State Fair blue ribbon for that damned apple pie of yours to boot . Then you go and rescue a homeless girl , too . Faster than a speeding bullet ; that 's Madeleine Palmer . MADELEINE Berit 's gone . THOMAS What ? You asked her to leave ? MADELEINE No . She chose to go . THOMAS And you let her ? MADELEINE They 're grown up , Nadine . Hayley and Berit . I ca n't ask or expect them to stay and light my path . Hayley did n't ask to be brought into this world . I brought her in . It 's my job to make sure she 's okay . She does n't owe me a thing . p. 106 THOMAS I hate that idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loan on the best years of our lives and they do n't have to pay it back . MADELEINE They do n't . Might be nice if she helps out when I 'm feeble and finally using all the profanity I 've had bottled up in my head all these years , but THOMAS Madeleine MADELEINE I know this makes little sense to you because of that damned dutiful boy of yours , but welcome to the real w  --  THOMAS Madeleine Conrad has n't been home in a year and a half . MADELEINE What ? THOMAS He did n't even send me a real birthday card . Just an e-mail : " Hi Mom . Enjoy your day . " He does n't say it , but he 's waiting for me to die . MADELEINE No . THOMAS It 's true . I 'm a bother . Something at the bottom of his to-do list . But I 'll show him . I 'm just starting to live . MADELEINE But every holiday I hear you enjoying yourselves . To be honest , I was envious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 107 MADELEINE You play a tape ? THOMAS Yes . " Festive Holiday Family Sounds . " MADELEINE Nadine , what did you do that for ? THOMAS For the same reason you brought that girl home . For the same reason Hayley came home for Christmas after all . You seemed to have everything and I wanted you to believe that I did , too . I mean , you even have a boyfriend . Where is he ? MADELEINE Right there . ( points to sofa ) THOMAS Where ? MADELEINE It 's Harry . THOMAS Is this some sort of joke , Madeleine ? MADELEINE No . THOMAS But Harry 's dead . MADELEINE Yes . You 're right . I have to ask him to go , completely . THOMAS Do you really see him ? MADELEINE Yes . THOMAS Can you touch him ? MADELEINE Wish I could . THOMAS Boy , if I could imagine a man to cuddle with and then put him away when I did n't need him You think there 's a tape for that ? p. 108 MADELEINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nadine . ( MADELEINE walks over to an open box , puts some of HARRY 'S things in it , closes it , and seals it . This causes HARRY to awake anxiously . He looks right at her . ) MADELEINE ( a pause ) Harry ? Harry , you have to go now . ( he shakes his head ) I knew you could hear me . You have to go , honey . I need space . ( Looking sad , he stands and rubs his eyes . ) THOMAS ( gives a little wave ) Hi Harry . ( He comes over to MADELEINE and tries to kiss her , but can not break through the invisible shield around him . This saddens him even more . He gestures with both hands from his heart to say " I love you , " bows gallantly to her , and exits . ) THOMAS You okay ? MADELEINE Sure . THOMAS Are you sure you 're sure ? MADELEINE Yes . THOMAS Do you have time to have a cup of tea with me ? MADELEINE You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . The children will come and go . They 'll become less our sons and daughters , and more our friends . Or , quite possibly , they 'll even become strangers . We ca n't mourn that . There have been enough bad days . p. 109 THOMAS This is worse than puberty . MADELEINE It 's a time for wonder , Nadine . Let 's begin . What is it we can have that we still want ? ( The women look at each other like two adolescents on the verge of a great adventure . Their exchange of smiles seals an understanding . Lights fade End of play. )
