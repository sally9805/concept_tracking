<p> Renardo Sidney has almost everything a 16-year-old , 6-foot-10 , 245-pound basketball prodigy usually has these days : shadowy sports agents hovering around his family , shoe companies groveling at his feet and AAU coaches vying for his services . But he has never had a high school team , and he does n't think he needs one . <p> The days when a college scholarship depended solely on performances in high school passed long ago , but Sidney might be the first athlete to prove that playing against other school teams is unnecessary to become highly pursued in the national market for players . <p> " I really do n't look at high school basketball like I do AAU , " Sidney said . " It 's not that important . I just like to win tournaments and rings and stuff like that . That summer basketball is where it counts . You really do n't have to look at high school basketball . I just wait until AAU to show everything I got . " <p> The most important weekend for Sidney over the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be this upcoming weekend , when he competes against other elite prospects at the ABCD Camp in Hackensack , N.J. <p> The recruiting publication Hoop Scoop named Sidney , a sophomore , one of the nation 's top 15 high school players even though he does n't play on a high school team . Recruiting analyst Bob Gibbons said the Mississippi native has risen faster than any prospect he has ever seen . And the family said it is moving from Jackson , Miss. , to California to take advantage of all the opportunities available to Sidney . <p> To Gibbons , Sidney 's growing reputation despite having no high school rsum illustrates the shift in power in amateur basketball " to the n-th degree . " <p> " Whether you like it or you do n't like it , that 's reality , " said Gibbons , whose Memorial Day weekend tournament in North Carolina first showcased Sidney on a large stage last year .

He would have been eligible this fall at the private school , Piney Woods , but Sidney 's father , Renardo Sidney Sr. , believes his son has outgrown the city and the state . <p> Without question , Sidney 's lack of high school experience has not held him back on the court . Last summer , he was named the MVP of the ABCD underclassmen all-star game . And three weeks ago , he claimed MVP honors for his performance in an elite summer-league tournament in Portland , Ore. , where he outshined several senior all-Americans , namely Ohio 's O.J. Mayo . <p> " It 's mind-boggling , really , " the elder Sidney said . " This kid is competing at this level , never played high school , and he can dominate kids even older than high school . He dominates college guys . If he were just playing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no way would he be the number one ninth-grader . No way . " <p> Without an allegiance to a high school program , Sidney and his family are completely immersed in the AAU environment , which is dominated by shoe companies that sponsor touring teams and tournaments in the hopes of landing future endorsement deals with players . Sidney 's father was a school security guard who said that as recently as two years ago the family could only afford most nights to eat eggs and toast . Six months ago , he became a Reebok " consultant . " His job responsibilities , he said , entail making sure his son plays at their tournaments . <p> " That 's it , " he added . " Make sure he gets to ABCD Camp and Las Vegas " for Reebok 's Big Tim tournament this month . <p> He said he is under no illusions that Reebok employs him for any other reason than to get close to his son , saying , " Who could argue with that ? " <p> Not Sonny Vaccaro , Reebok 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is what this is . No different than a college recruiting . . . they only want you to come to my school . The more airplanes we have and the better time we have on a recruiting visit , the better chance I have of getting you . " <p> The elder Sidney said Nike and Adidas made similar offers for his services ; representatives still call in attempts to lure the son to their tournaments . The voice mail boxes on his two cellphones are full ; he never checks them and does not answer the phone if he sees an unfamiliar area code . He said he has received calls from individuals who refused to give their names but urged the elder Sidney to call back at a specific extension . <p> " There are so many people coming at " her son , said Sidney 's mother , Patricia . " I ca n't imagine what it will be like in 11th or 12th grade . I 've never seen anything like it in my life . " <p> Sidney expects to spend those school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family says his basketball development will depend much more on his experience with the team he recently joined : the Southern California All-Stars , a Reebok-sponsored AAU team that counts NBA player Tyson Chandler among its alumni . This summer , he 's also working out with NBA players and former college standouts at Irvine 's Sports Club/LA , a luxurious 130,000-square foot fitness center with valet parking . This for a player whose training regimen 14 months ago included crack-of-dawn hill-running sessions with his father that the two dubbed " The Breakfast Club . " <p> Once the family settles in Los Angeles , the elder Sidney said his son will become an " overnight celebrity . " <p> The absence of a high school career has not deterred " different people " from offering the family money in return for increased influence with Sidney , his father said . The younger Sidney said those offers come primarily from summer league and high school coaches and have all been refused . <p> Vaccaro , who has become somewhat of a confidant for the family , said the Sidneys call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they have been offered because " if they tell me , my guilt is bigger . " Vaccaro said he tells the family to " stand firm and hold out , " but acknowledges the temptation is great . <p> " That 's hard for any rational person to ask them to give up , when they do n't have anything in their pocket right now , " Vaccaro said . " If you have nothing there , how are you going to say , ' No ' ? So every once in a while someone gives you something you put it in your pocket or go buy yourself something , who am I to say do n't do it ? " <p> Chuck Wansley , one of Sidney 's former coaches , said he or family members have also been approached by at least four individuals who claimed they were connected with sports agencies . The men usually initiate a conversation by saying they run a camp or tournament , Wansley said , but eventually explain their true intention  --  to cultivate a relationship with the family in hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBA contract in four years . Vaccaro confirmed Wansley 's account and added that at least two were linked to " very big " agents . <p> " The land mines Renardo will have wo n't be with ability  --  it 's going to be with people , " Vaccaro said . " And for the first time , I can say this : The biggest thing will be people aligning themselves to be an agent for him in four years . . . . <p> " One-hundred dollars is like a dollar to some of these people agents . This is a major investment . You can look him in the eye and say , ' One-hundred million dollars in his career is nothing . ' He 's right in the middle of it . He 's right here in Hollywood . . . . It 's show business , and these people are substantial . This is not going to be a walk in the park . The hardest part is going to be when the game is over , not when the game is being played . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he led Peeples Middle School to an undefeated record , but college coaches have found him . Gibbons said those coaches first recommended Sidney , who can play inside and on the perimeter , for his Memorial Day weekend tournament last year . <p> Sidney receives about 10 letters a week from colleges , but coaches often go to other measures to try to cultivate a relationship with the player , the elder Sidney said . He said colleges several times have invited him to run a basketball camp at their school for a fee . He has done it once  --  at a Southeastern Conference school  --  but declined all other offers because he believes the schools only want to get close to his son . <p> " It 's legal , " the elder Sidney said . " My thumb 's up for that part . There is a bunch of stuff that goes on that is not legal , but I wo n't comment about that . I 'm trying to make sure he is not doing anything illegal . " <p> More than 10 high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sidney ruled out some because , he said , players on their teams told him they do n't always have to do their own work to get grades . <p> But the Sidney family listened to one recruitment pitch , even though it began surreptitiously . Two men showed up in Mississippi , telling Sidney they were reporters with a new magazine in California and that he was the subject of their cover story . <p> His mother immediately called Vaccaro ; the elder Sidney met the men for lunch . Vaccaro said he believes the two men were trying to persuade Sidney to transfer to Compton 's Dominguez High , which is sponsored by Nike . <p> " It was scary , " the elder Sidney said . " That was definitely a Hollywood act . They told me two names , but I do n't know if that is their real name . They could have been posing for an agent . . . . So you just never know . " <p> Sidney said he and his family later visited California and the men gave them tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " They took us to the Lakers game ; we went out to eat every day , " Sidney said . " We hung out , late nights and stuff . We had fun . They showed us a good time . They wanted me to come out here just to visit Dominguez and see if I would like it or whether I 'd go to it . We stopped messing with them . I never thought about Dominguez . It was in the ghetto . " <p> Their recruitment pitch included a phone call that the men said was from Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant . When Sidney got on the phone , the man purported to be Bryant and told him he should stay humble and work hard . To this day , Sidney does n't know who he spoke to . Bryant could not be reached to comment . <p> Sidney lives the life of someone teetering between the world of a teenager and a quasi-professional . One moment Sidney , polite and with only a wisp of facial hair under his nose , laments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall . The next , he goes head-to-head with 23-year-old Josh Childress , a double-digit scorer for the Atlanta Hawks , and is not-so-kindly reminded by his summer-league coach that he has " got ta work against NBA players ! " <p> " He is one of a kind , " said Cedric Bozeman , the former UCLA standout and one of a handful of former college players to train regularly with Sidney during his recent two-week visit to California . <p> Instead , he awaits his high school debut . <p> The elder Sidney believes his son 's unique circumstance " gives high school basketball something to think about . A lot of high school coaches want to take credit for getting this kid to this college , getting this kid to that college , when it 's definitely not true because kids get seen in the summer time , everyone knows that .
