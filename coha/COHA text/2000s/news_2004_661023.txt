<p> In the 1956 sci-fi adventure " Forbidden Planet , " an American astronaut receives a " brain boost " from an alien machine that temporarily gives him enhanced mental powers . Before he dies from the effects of the boost , he helps unravel the mystery of how the civilization became extinct : It could n't control its own immense mental powers . <p> More recently , the characters in " The Matrix " film series are shown " downloading " knowledge into their brains nearly instantaneously . In " Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind " the lead character has the uncomfortable memories of a love affair removed from his mind , with unexpected results . <p> What used to be confined to speculative fiction is fast becoming scientific fact . Brain boosting , or " neural enhancement , " is already being done - and much more powerful techniques are on the way . Some observers say we 're rushing into this brain-gain revolution without sufficient thought or preparation . <p> " We 're about to be handed a bunch of powerful new capabilities ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farah , a director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Pennsylvania , in an e-mail . " We should always think through the ethical consequences of changing ourselves and our lives , for the individual and for society . " <p> While some may worry that we 'll turn ourselves into a race of Frankensteins , others look forward to new Einsteins . Optimists argue that humans are only doing what they 've always been doing : trying to improve themselves , whether it 's taking caffeine to stay alert or undergoing cosmetic surgery to change their appearance . <p> The brain-enhancement revolution is already under way . The drug Ritalin , first given to control hyperactivity in children , now is routinely used by healthy high school and college students to sharpen their thinking before taking exams . The long-term health effects are unknown . <p> Modafinil was developed to treat narcolepsy , a rare condition causing daytime sleepiness . But now it is used by those who simply want to be wakeful and alert , and recently seven American track and field athletes admitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulation , used for nearly two decades to treat depression , has also been found to enhance problem-solving abilities in normal individuals . <p> Improved brain imaging , or mapping , is yielding new techniques such as " brain fingerprinting , " which purports to be able to locate memories within the brain , raising troubling possibilities for invasion of privacy . " There 's nothing more private and personal than a person 's memories , " says Richard Glen Boire , codirector of the Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics in Davis , Calif . <p> Brave new ethics <p> Some scientists see a new field emerging they call " neuroethics , " which would try to identify where the ethical land mines are buried and how to deal with them . These judgment calls will be vital because the revolution in the neurosciences " is just as important as the genetic revolution , but no one is paying attention , " says Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania . <p> As in the case of Ritalin , most of the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases . In the 2002 book " Our Posthuman Future : Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution , " influential thinker Francis Fukuyama called for governmental regulation of using such technologies for neural enhancement . <p> But even others with ethical concerns say drawing such a " bright line " between the use of a drug or other technology for therapy or for enhancement is problematic . <p> Pharmaceutical companies are going to want to produce and market drugs that appeal to 100 percent of the population , not just the minority who are sick at any given time , Mr. Boire points out . After all , many people would like a better memory , to be able to think a little more quickly , or to forget troubling memories . <p> Yet a number of issues of personal liberty are being raised , he says . " What rights does the person have to manage their own thought processes ? " Boire asks . " Thought is not just something that is changed by reading a book or hearing a speaker . Now , and more and more , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents . " <p> How will we be able to say yes to therapy but no to enhancement ? Professor Caplan asks . He balks at the idea of telling someone " you can take a pill if you have dyslexia , but you ca n't take a pill if you 're just a poor reader . It 's very tough . It wo n't work . " <p> Others see no need for making an ethical distinction between therapy and enhancement . " There 's better and worse . More life is good . More smarts is good , " says James Hughes , who teaches health policy at Trinity College in Hartford , Conn. , and is author of the forthcoming book " Citizen Cyborg : Why Democratic Societies Must Respond to the Redesigned Human of the Future . " <p> " Sometimes I think I 'm arguing for the plow " - a simple dramatic upgrade in human technology , Professor Hughes says . In 100 years , he predicts , " we 'll have currently unimaginable cognitive abilities on tap " through technology . <p> Playing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhancement - such as Professor Fukuyama ; Bill McKibben , author of " Enough : Staying Human in an Engineered Age " ; and Leon Kass , the head of the President 's Council on Bioethics - are , in Hughes 's assessment , " bio-Luddites , " dragging their heels against inevitable technological progress . <p> But in a recent National Science Foundation-sponsored report entitled " Neurocognitive enhancement : What can we do and what should we do ? , " a group of scientists , educators , and ethicists concluded that " continuing our current laissez- faire approach toward brain boosting risks running afoul of public opinion , drug laws , and physicians ' codes of ethics . The question is therefore not whether we need policies governing neurocognitive enhancement , but rather what kind of policies we need . " <p> The report identifies a number of areas of concern , including safety , fairness and equity , coercion , and " personhood and intangible values " - and concentrates on the questions surrounding enhancement drugs , stressing that they are leading the way in the field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional medical effects and the more subtle psychological effects that are likely to accompany neurocognitive enhancement , " says Dr. Farah , an author of the study . " For example , will attentional enhancement become routine and will we use it to become an even more workaholic society than we are now ? " <p> While patients might be willing to undertake some risk to use a drug to treat a disease , enhancement drugs should meet a higher threshold for safety , says Judy Illes , a senior research scholar in biomedical ethics at Stanford University and the study 's other author . <p> Might Ritalin use , for example , cause a loss of mental capacity in old age ? Our worry about possible hidden costs to brain boosting is part " of our mistrust of unearned rewards , " the sense that we may be making a Faustian bargain , the study says . <p> Even enhancement advocate Hughes agrees that safety remains important . The Food and Drug Administration needs to certify drug safety " and it needs to be independent of the biomedical industry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> Mapping the brain brings its own set of concerns , Caplan adds . He foresees brain scans someday being used at airports to screen passengers . Do you have to give informed consent to have someone look at your brain ? he asks . What if it can be done at a distance without your knowledge ? And who 's going to be allowed to keep information about your brain ? <p> Some kind of regulation will be needed . " You do n't want people just setting up machines on the sidewalk saying ' I 'll tell you if your spouse is cheating on you , ' " Caplan says . <p> Defining identity <p> Perhaps most troubling - and most difficult to deal with from a scientific basis - is the question of personhood . " Some people just think messing with the brain is unnatural because the brain is the seat of who we are , " Caplan says . " To change it is to change our identity . " <p> " It 's at the heart of what this new field of neuroethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean we must forestall research " because it 's getting too close to our personhood , " she says , " but rather to empower research with critical ethical thinking . " <p> The concept of a " self " does not make much sense in the framework of neuroscience , " where you and I are just big networks of neurons that can be changed by a drug or other procedure , " Farah adds . On the other hand , she says , " I feel I have a self , I feel that other brains are persons , and even though this may be an illusion , it is part of my understanding of life that I am not ready to dispense with , no matter what neuroscience tells me ! <p> " I think the most challenging ethical issues in neuroscience have to do with reconciling these two views of human life .
