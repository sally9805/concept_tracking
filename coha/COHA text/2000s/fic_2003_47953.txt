We have a grandfather somewhere . We do n't know where-I mean , we kiddos do n't . Not anymore . <p> Mostly we remember him at the low house by the lake . Grousing at the black flies , stinking up Nature with the smell of his burning charcoal-and-plum pipe tobacco . A stout figure , like an orator in some senate , he liked to stand . <p> He went to stand and smoke under the white pines that leaned overhead all in one direction , like people straining to hear in a crowd . Grandmother , we knew , was buried beneath a large pink stone laid square in the ground . Letters were carved in it-ALBERTA WHITE FOX , 1888-1944 . We used to laugh at her name , even though she was our grandmother . We 'd never met her , so we did n't feel guilty . She was living under the stone at the lake long before we came along . <p> But we knew our grandfather fairly well . Well enough to be reluctant about kissing his hairy old face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lazy personal habits , that an unflattering yellow streaked the white beard raveling down into corkscrew spikes . As if he 'd stained his own facial hair with tobacco runnings . But we were used to him , and his presents , and his whiskey , and his Bible , his whiplash way of throwing down the cards if he 'd drawn a winning hand . <p> When he was n't at the lake , he was off with Aunt Myrtle or Aunt Tessa or Aunt Pamela Pearl . " Taking a recreation this winter with Aunt Pamela Pearl " - he 'd shake his unlit pipe at our parents- " do n't you worry a thing about me . I 've got the money , and she 's got the mischief . " <p> Sometimes there 'd be a postcard . From Havana or New Orleans or the track at Saratoga . Gaming tables in Monte Carlo , one of us seems to recall . A note on fine stationery from a Mayfair hotel , describing Royal Ascot . <p> " Where does our grandfather live ? " one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember him year-round , not only when presents arrived , or when summer advertised itself , hot and promising , on the horizon of some sultry spring day . <p> " He 's a man of the world , " said our parents . " He does n't live anyplace you can write to . " <p> Well , we knew we 'd see him at the lake , sooner or later . Slashing at the weeds with a golf club , he 'd stick around until he made sure that we were settled in . That we remembered him . He loitered while we paid him due attention , and once we began to ignore him , he seemed relieved . He 'd rent a car and visit some friends in Canada . " Going to play hooky . Too many bugs around the lake for an old man like me , " he 'd say . <p> And he 'd return by the end of the summer , in time for farewells . " To smack you into good behavior for one more year , " he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keeping , Alberta ? " He 'd stand on her pink stone , rub his shoes on it as if it were a welcome mat . " Alberta and me , we go way back , " he bellowed at our parents once . " She stood by me ; why should n't I stand by her ? Or on her once in a while ? Is n't that what family is for ? " <p> But this past June when we got to the lake and unloaded the automobile and spread our boxes and suitcases and fishing gear and food all over the camp , our grandfather was n't waiting for us . <p> " He wo n't be coming this year , " said our father . <p> The truth leaned away from us , no less the truth for that . We had n't liked our grandfather ; we missed him , anyway . He had been a necessary obstacle to the joy of summer at the lake , a dour sentry to be placated with politeness . The task of greeting his smelly old bearded scowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ? " said the youngest of us , and ran to check the pink stone to see if ALBERTA WHITE FOX had rolled over to make room for our grandfather . <p> " No . He 's found another aunt to escort around . " <p> By now we 'd learned that these aunts were not grafted onto the family tree in any respectable way . <p> The summer ended this year with a sweltering storm from the north . August heat leaning backwards against September chill . What a display : lightning , like discharge off a flywheel , thunder coming so fast it seemed to fall flat on the house . The lake was a panic of waves pushing in several directions . We packed up the car , bled the pipes , lowered the sashes , set traps for the mice . In the slashing downpour , as we pulled out of the driveway , our grandfather 's absence made the camp seem lost , unrecoverable , as if the thunder carried shadows with it . We drove away , scared of the array of weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was our last departure . The camp burned down , not in that storm but through arson by local troublemakers a couple of weeks later . Grandfather sold the land and , for all we knew , ALBERTA WHITE FOX along with it . This Christmas we did n't get a postcard from some distant resort . We got an old browning photograph , printed on stiff stock . It was addressed to us kiddos . <p> On the back , in old-fashioned writing : PRECISION MARCHING AT THE ORPHANAGE , 1890 . <p> And in our grandfather 's quivery hand : That 's me , third from the left in the last row . I started out life as an orphan and understand I 'm to end it that way too . I do n't remember much of those days except we did n't have games at the lake as you 've had . I do n't understand much of these days either , come to that . But kindness did a good job of filling up the middle years . Be kind if you can , kiddos . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an instant to catch themselves . The rest went unsaid , loudly . <p> Before it disappeared , we pored over the photograph . On shallow risers stood six rows of boys , four to a row . They all wore smart white caps with black brims , white shirts tucked into short black trousers , high black shoes with higher black socks , above which white knees showed vulnerably . Our grandfather could have been any one of those boys . There was n't even the smallest smudge of recognizable family expression on the third from the left , last row . He was standing , as much at attention as a small boy can . <p> The boys made a stiff little army , ranked beside an equally anonymous proctor . The outlines of the trees at the end of the lawn were in sharper focus than the blurred edges of the orphans-we could make out birches leaning , an elm , a couple of rhododendrons squatting below . The focus so sharp we could count the petals on the rhododendrons one by one . <p> We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can recognize him when it happens . In the meantime we sometimes pretend we 're orphans . To see how it feels . It 's not such a hard game to learn . <p>
