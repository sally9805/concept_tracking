Want less whining , more great memories ? Try these tips for hapPV travels . // ever wonder why family trips often do n't turn out to be the funfests you 'd hoped for ? As a parent and the author of 23 travel books , including National Geographic Guide to Caribbean Family Vacations , I can tell you that fending off the following common pitfalls can help you get the amazing vacation you all deserve . FAMILYTRIP WRECKER #1 : JET-LAG STUPOR When you 're flying across time zones with infants through preteens , go for night flights to maximize your children 's sleep time , suggests Linda Goldstein , M.D. , a pediatrician in Chevy Chase , Maryland . Should you alter your child 's sleep schedule to get her in sync with the new time zone ? It depends on her age and the actual time change . " If you 're flying with a baby from New York to California-where there 's only a three-hour time difference-for a week , " says Goldstein , " then I do n't suggest changing her body clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a regular routine to begin with . " Stick with the schedule you use at home , and prepare yourself for an early breakfast by stashing milk in the minibar and packing along a bottle warmer . Older kids on a similar trip can be kept up for an hour or two later at night for a few days prior to departure ; that way they 'll become accustomed to rising later in the day . And what about travel overseas where the time is five or more hours later than eastern standard time ? Wake your kids an hour earlier than you normally do , starting three or four days before the trip , so they 'll be sleepy earlier in the evening . FAMILY TRIP WRECKER #2 : TRAVELING-WITHFRIENDS CLASHES Renting a beach house with another couple and their kids might seem like a swell idea , but you should choose your travel companions wisely . Besides mak-ing sure the kids have similar interests , are about the same age , and get along , you need to have a heart-to-heart with the other parents about your vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending philosophies when it comes to eating out and activities ? Do you agree on how much time both families should spend with each other and whether your ideas of fun revolve around sight-seeing versus pool time ? Still , if you find yourself in a situation , say , where your travel partners get up at the crack of dawn every day to visit some pricey attraction-and you 'd rather not-explain to your child that " it does n't matter what the other family does ; this is how we do things , " says Susan Newman , a social psychologist in Metuchen , New Jersey , who specializes in family issues . Yes , you will get complaints when you nix the megawater park outing , so use that time to do something special with your child : Make good on your promise to teach your 10-year-old the backstroke or build that sand city with the shell garden . FAMILY TRIP WRECKER #3 : THE JAM-PACKED DAY Of course you want your kids to see and do it all , but if you try to cram the science museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , they 'll be cranky and miserable . So schedule fewer activities and allow time for the serendipitous : If the hands-on cartooning class at the children 's museum fascinates your kids , stay there instead of rushing on to the zoo . And build in downtime . " I have three boys , ages 1 , 5 , and 7 , " says Becca Garcia of Menlo Park , California . " If they become exhausted after a few hours at the amusement park , I get their hands stamped for same-day reentry and take them back to the hotel for a quick nap . After all , a tired child will ruin the day for the rest of the family , too . " FAMILY TRIP WRECKER #4 : CAR-RIDE MELTDOWNS You know the obvious remedies for backseat mayhem : with young kids , breaks every two to three hours for leg stretching , bathroom visits , diaper changes , and snacks , and less frequent stops with older children . Also , take along a few travel props to keep the kids occupied , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and coloring books . Diane Adams of Cooperstown , New York , gives her kids some breathing room during long car trips by placing a cooler in the backseat between them . " Inside are healthy snacks in singleportion servings in sandwich bags , " she says . " The cooler is also a good barrier for establishing personal space . " My own remedy for backseat bickering ? I once pulled over to the side of the road and waited without saying anything . After ten minutes , my kids were quiet : They wanted to get going so we could reach our destinationand they knew the only way to do that was to settle down . One more tip : To avoid getting stuck in a make-you-want-to-scream traffic jam , log on to fhwa.dot.gov/trafficinfo ( a site run by the Federal Highway Administration ) before you head out . Click on your state to find out about road construction or traffic delays so you can chart the smoothest route . FAMILY TRIP WRECKER #5 : THE GIMMES Tired of your kid pitching a fit when you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , tell him how much money you 'll dole out for mementos . " My kids know they can get one thing , " says Elisa Fershtadt of New York , " and that it has to be less than $10 . " When your child gets a bad case of the gimmes , remind him of his budget and that this store is just one of many . If he rushes to spend , suggest he buy something he can use on the trip , such as spiffy sunglasses . When he asks for more loot later , say , " We already bought you a nice present : those great sunglasses you 're wearing . " Another solution : Create some souvenirs . Tell your child , " Each day let 's find something we can use to make a mobile that reminds us of this trip . " Then after your visit to the aquarium , go to the gift shop and buy something small , such as a plastic fish to string up . At the natural history museum , you might get a small quartz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nature walk and see if we can find things to put on our mobile . " Then look for rocks , beach glass , and the like . Do it for each major trip ; most kids are excited to start and continue a family tradition . Sidebar " My best sanity-savers " " We found the secret for vacationing with kids : Take a cruise ! Most lines provide activities with qualified child counselors at no extra cost . My son is 5 and could n't wait to get to the kids ' club . " Donna McCaul Thibodeau , Kenneth City , Florida " We let each of our four kids select one activity they 'd like to do while on vacation . This way they 're involved in the planning process , and everyone gets to participate in at least one activity they like . " Terri Haro , Macomb , Illinois " To keep my 9-year-old happy while we 're traveling , I stock up on goodies from a dollar store beforehand and space them out during car , train , or bus rides . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since the toys are inexpensive , I do n't care if they make it to the end of the vacation . " Wendy Wallach , Pomona , New York // <p>
