The Cross talked . And walked . Jesus had died the day before , uttering his last words : " My power , O power , you have left me behind ! " His body was taken down and placed in the tomb . But now , as the Sabbath dawned , a great voice came from the sky , and two men descended . The stone blocking the tomb rolled away of its own accord , and while Roman soldiers gaped , " three men emerged from the tomb , two of them supporting the other , with a Cross following behind . The heads of the two reached up to the sky , but the head of the one they were leading went up above the skies . And they heard a voice , ' Have you preached to those who are sleeping ? ' And a reply came from the Cross , ' Yes . ' " <P> It is a surreal Resurrection : the all-important Christian instant , but garbled , like a favorite song issuing from the bottom of a deep well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Battle for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew , by Bart Ehrman , it was Holy Writ for several centuries to some early Christian communities in the Middle East . The passage comes from something called the Gospel of Peter . You probably have n't heard of Peter because by A.D. 350 church fathers had tarred it as heresy , along with dozens of other early Scriptures with names like the Gospel of Mary , the Acts of John , the Homilies of Clement and the Gospel of Truth . Thus Peter and the others languished in ignominy , more or less forgotten . <P> Until now . Recently these texts  --  you might think of them as lost Christianities if you 're a religious liberal or as early heresies if you 're a conservative  --  have been experiencing a resurrection of their own . Their renaissance is unlikely to reinstate them in the exalted company of the canonical New Testament Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John . But it fills a perceived need for alternative views of the Christ story on the part of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faith 's theological restrictions . This yearning is transforming the once obscure texts into objects of popular discourse . Their rising cultural profile can be seen in : <P>  --  THE DA VINCI CODE . A key plot point in Dan Brown 's best-selling novel , with 4.3 million copies in print , is that the Roman Catholic Church suppressed 80 alternative Gospels , several describing a physical relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene . <P>  --  OTHER REINTERPRETATIONS OF MARY MAGDALENE . Feminist biblical scholars like Harvard 's Karen King use some of these texts to argue that far from being a wanton prostitute , Magdalene was seen by some as a disciple whose standing rivaled that of the Apostle Peter ( see TIME , Aug. 11 , 2003 ) . <P>  --  THE MATRIX TRILOGY . The movies ' premise that the world we know is neither good nor real but the creation of a malign power echoes early texts that are now known as Gnostic . Similar themes mark the work of science-fiction patriarch Philip K. Dick , whose stories have been turned into movies like Blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening on Christmas .
