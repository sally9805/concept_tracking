" Talk to me in six weeks . " Melinda Jaskiel 's voice was firm . Clear . Propped on his good leg on the back veranda , his cell phone nearly stuck to his ear in the sweltering bayou heat , Rick Bentz realized his boss was n't going to budge . Sweat dripping off his nose , he balanced on one crutch , the thick rubber tip wedged between two flagstones . His back ached and walking was a strain , but he would n't admit it to a soul-especially not to Jaskiel . As head of the homicide division in the New Orleans Police Department , she had the authority to put him back on active duty . Or not . It was her call . <p> Once again , Melinda Jaskiel held the fate of his career in her hands . <p> Once again , he was begging . " I need to work . " Jesus , he hated the desperation in his voice . <p> " You need to be at a hundred percent , maybe a hundred and ten to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intense Louisiana sun beat down on the back of his neck and a fine mist rose from the swampland that backed up to the cottage nestled into the woods . Jaskiel had given him a job when no one else would touch him after the mess he 'd left in L.A. And now she was shutting him down . <p> He heard her mutter something under her breath and thought for a split second she was reconsidering . " Look , Rick , I do n't see you pushing papers at a desk from eight to five . " <p> " I 've been in P.T. for a couple of months now , strong as ever . " <p> " Strong enough to chase down a suspect ? Wrestle him to the ground ? Break down a door ? Hit the deck , roll , draw your weapon , and cover your partner ? " <p> " That 's all TV BS . " <p> " Is it ? " Jaskiel 's voice was skeptical . " Seems to me you were doing just that kind of TV BS ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him too well . " You know the drill . Bring in a doctor 's release and we 'll discuss your reinstatement . Discuss . No promises . You know , retirement 's not a bad idea . " <p> He snorted . " Gee , Melinda , I 'm getting the idea you 're trying to get rid of me . " <p> " You 're still in physical therapy and you 're wound too tight . End of subject . I 'll talk to you later . " She hung up . <p> " Son of a bitch ! " He flung his crutch across the flagstones of the veranda , where it skidded , clattering noisily and startling a mockingbird from a nearby magnolia tree into flight . " Son of a goddamned bitch . " His fingers clenched over his cell and he considered hurling it into the swamp , but did n't . Hell , he did n't want to explain that . So far , the department only questioned his physical ability . He did n't want to give the powers that be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No soul searching . No pouring out his heart . No thank you . <p> He stood with difficulty , his balance not what it had been before the accident , despite what he 'd told Jaskiel . And sometimes his leg hurt like hell . He knew he was n't really ready for active duty , but he was going out of his freakin ' mind staying at home . Hell , even his relationship with his wife Olivia was beginning to wear thin . Her biological clock was ticking like crazy and she was pressuring him to have a kid . His own daughter , Kristi , was in her twenties . He was n't sure he wanted to start over . <p> No , what he needed was to get out of the house and back to work . It had been nearly three months since the accident and he could n't take sitting around another second . <p> " So do something about it , " he ordered himself . <p> Gritting his teeth , he took a step unaided . <p> First one foot , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot forward with the walker and dragging the second one up to it . No way . He was going to walk across this damned patio one foot in front of the other if it killed him . He 'd show them all . In a month he 'd be running across these stupid stones . A crow sat on one of the roof 's gables and cried noisily , its raspy caw echoing through the scrub oak and pine . <p> Bentz barely noticed . <p> A third step . <p> Then four . <p> He was sweating now . Concentrating hard . The heat was oppressive , sun beating down , the dank smell of the swamp heavy in his nostrils . The crow kept up his incessant , mocking caw . Irritating bastard . <p> Another step and Bentz looked up , away from uneven stones and to the bench , his destination . He was crossing his patio on his own two feet . <p> Just as he would have if he had n't been injured . <p> Just as he would have if he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have if he had n't been forced to consider early retirement . <p> He moved forward again , more easily , more confidently . <p> And then he felt it . <p> That cold certainty that he was being watched . <p> His gut tightened as he looked over his shoulder . Dry , brittle leaves rustled on the windless day . <p> The crow had disappeared , its scolding cries silent . <p> A flicker of light between the branches . Something in the thicket , just on the other side of the veranda , moved . A shadow passed quickly , darting through the undergrowth . <p> Oh , sweet Jesus . <p> Instinctively , Bentz reached for his sidearm . <p> His hand came up empty as he rounded to face the woods . He was n't wearing his shoulder holster . <p> Not in his own house . <p> He squinted . <p> What the hell was it ? <p> Sunlight played through the lacy canopy of needles and leaves . His heart thumped crazily . The spit dried in his mouth . <p> It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the goose bumps crawling over his flesh and the tightening of every muscle in his body told him otherwise . <p> Idiot ! You 're in your own damned backyard . <p> He turned slightly , trying to make out if the intruder were an opossum , or a deer , or even an alligator crawling up from the swamp , but he knew deep in his soul that this was no wild creature wandering too close to his house . <p> Uh-uh . <p> The shivering leaves stilled on this hot , breathless day . <p> Bentz squinted into the forest . He had no doubt that he would see her . <p> Again . <p> He was n't disappointed . <p> Through the shimmering heat her image appeared . Dressed in that same sexy black dress , flashing him the barest of smiles , she stood between the bleached bark of two cypress trees . <p> Jennifer . <p> His first wife . <p> The woman he 'd sworn to love through all his days . <p> The bitch who had betrayed him ... And she was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . The fragrance of gardenias wafted through the air . <p> He swallowed . <p> Hard . <p> A ghost ? <p> Or real flesh and blood ? <p> The woman , a dead ringer for his first wife , stood deep in the woods , staring at him with wide , knowing eyes and that sexy little smile ... God , that smile had turned him inside out . <p> His heart went still as death . <p> An eerie chill slid through his veins . <p> " Jennifer ? " he said aloud , though he knew his first wife was long dead . <p> She arched a single eyebrow and his stomach dropped to his knees . <p> " Jen ? " Bentz took a step forward , caught his toe on an uneven rock , and went down . Hard . His knees hit first . Bam ! His chin bounced against the mortar and stone , rattling his jaw , scraping his skin . <p> Pain exploded through his brain . The raven cackled , as if laughing at him . His cell phone skittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered under his breath as he lay still for a second , taking in a couple of breaths , telling himself he was a goddamned idiot , a freak who was seeing things that did n't exist . He moved one leg , then the other , mentally assessing the damage to his already racked-up body . <p> Not that long ago he 'd been paralyzed , the result of a freak accident in a lightning storm . His spinal cord had been bruised , not severed . Slowly he 'd recovered to this point and he hoped to hell that he had n't reinjured his damned back or legs . <p> Painfully he rolled over and pushed himself onto his knees while staring over the edge of the veranda toward the spot where he 'd seen her . <p> Jennifer , of course , had vanished . <p> Poof . <p> Like a ghost in an old cartoon . <p> Using a bench for leverage , he pulled himself to his feet and stood , solid and steady . Gingerly , ignoring the pain , he walked closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked for something , anything to indicate she 'd been out there . Tempting him . Teasing him . Making him think he was going crazy . <p> But nothing moved in the forest . <p> No woman hid in the deep umbra . <p> No drop in the temperature indicated a ghost had trod upon his soul . <p> And , beyond all that , Jennifer was dead . Buried in a plot in California . He knew that as well as his own name . Had n't he identified her himself over twelve years ago ? She 'd been mangled horribly in the accident , nearly unrecognizable , but the woman behind the wheel in the single-car accident had been his beautiful and scheming first wife . <p> His stomach twisted a bit as a cloud passed over the sun . High in the sky jets streaked , leaving white plumes to slice the wide expanse of blue . <p> Why now had she returned-at least in his mind ? Had it been the coma ? He 'd lain unconscious in the hospital for two weeks and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd finally awoken , staring through blurry eyes , he 'd seen her image . A cold waft of air had whispered across his skin and he 'd smelled the heady aroma of her perfume , a familiar scent laced with gardenias . Then he 'd caught a glimpse of her in the doorway , backlit by the dimmed hall lights , blowing him a kiss and looking as real as if she were truly still alive . <p> Which of course she was n't . <p> And yet ... <p> Now , as he stared into the shaded bayou where shadows lengthened and the steamy scent of slow-moving water filtered through the leaves of cypress and cottonwood , he second-guessed the truth . He doubted what he 'd been certain was fact ; he questioned his sanity . <p> Could it be the pain pills he 'd been taking since his accident as his daughter- their daughter-had insisted ? <p> Or was he just plain going nuts ? <p> " Crap . " He glared at the woods . <p> No Jennifer . <p> Of course . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been triggered by nearly half a month of teetering on that razor-sharp edge between life and death . <p> " Get a grip , " he told himself . <p> Man , he could use a smoke right now . He 'd given up the habit years before , but in times of stress nothing gave him a clear sense of what needed to be done like a hit of nicotine curling through his lungs . <p> Grimacing , he heard a series of sharp barks . The dog door opened with a click , followed by the scratch of tiny paws flying across the stones and a high-pitched yip . Hairy S , his wife Olivia 's terrier mutt , streaked across the veranda , sending a squirrel squawking loudly up the bole of a scraggly pine . Hairy , who had been named in honor of Harry S. Truman , Olivia 's grandmother 's favorite president , was going nuts . He leaped and barked at the trunk of the tree , his mottled hair bristling as the squirrel taunted and scolded from the safety of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bentz was n't in the mood . His head was beginning to pound and his pride had already suffered a beating with the fall . <p> " What the hell are you doing ? " Montoya 's voice boomed at him and he nearly tripped again . <p> " I 'm walking without a damned cane or crutch . What 's it look like ? " <p> " Like a face plant . " <p> Bentz turned to find his partner slipping through the side gate and striding across the flagstones with the irritating ease of a jungle cat . To add insult to injury , Olivia 's scrappy little dog diverted from the squirrel to run circles around Montoya 's feet , leaving Bentz to dust off his pride . He tried not to wince , but his knees stung where his skin had been scraped off . No doubt bruises were already forming . He sensed the ooze of warm , sticky blood run down his shins . <p> " I was watching from over the top of the gate . Looked to me like you were attempting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny . " <p> " I thought so . " <p> Bentz was n't in the mood to be ridiculed by his smart-assed partner . Make that his smart-assed younger partner . With hair that gleamed black in the afternoon light , reflective sunglasses covering eyes that were as sharp as they had ever been , Montoya was younger and more athletic than Bentz . And not afraid to remind his older partner of it . <p> When he walked , Montoya damned near swaggered and the diamond stud in his earlobe glittered . At least today he was n't wearing his signature black leather jacket , just a white T-shirt and jeans . Looking cool as all get-out . <p> It bugged the hell out of Bentz . <p> " Olivia at work ? " <p> Bentz nodded . " Should be home in a couple of hours . " His wife still worked a couple of days a week at the Third Eye , a New Age gift shop near Jackson Square that had survived Hurricane Katrina . She 'd completed her master 's in psychology a while back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't quite made the transition to full time . Bentz suspected she missed the hustle and bustle of the French Quarter . <p> Montoya found Bentz 's cell phone near a huge ceramic pot filled with cascading pink and white petunias . " Looking for this ? " He dusted off the phone , then handed it to him . <p> Glowering , Bentz muttered , " Thanks , " then jammed the damned phone into his pocket . <p> " Bad news ? " Montoya asked , suddenly sober . <p> " Jaskiel does n't think I 'm fit for duty . " <p> " You 're not . " <p> Bentz bit back a hot retort as a dragonfly zipped past . Considering his current state , he could n't argue . " Is there a reason you came all the way out here , or did you just want to give me a bad time ? " <p> " Little of both , " Montoya said . This time his teeth flashed white against his black goatee . " They 're reassigning me . Making Zaroster my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary ' partner . " <p> Lynn Zaroster was a junior detective who had been with the department a little over two years though she was barely twenty-six . Cute , smart , and athletic , Zaroster was filled with enthusiasm . She was as idealistic as Bentz was jaded . <p> " Change of pace for you . " <p> " Yeah . " Montoya 's smile faded . " Sometimes I feel like a goddamned babysitter . " <p> " You 're afraid this might be permanent . " Because Bentz was being pushed out of the department . <p> " Not if I have my say , but I thought I 'd tell you myself . Rather than you hearing it from someone else . " <p> Bentz nodded , wiped the sweat from his face with the sleeve of his shirt . From inside the house , through the open window , he heard the sound of Olivia 's parrot , which , like the dog and this little cottage , she had inherited from her grandmother . " Jaskiel 's been hinting that I should retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Enjoy what 's left of my life . " <p> Montoya snorted . " You 're not even fifty . That 's a whole lotta left . ' Thirty-maybe forty-years of fishing , watching football , and sitting on your ass . " <p> " Does n't seem to matter . " <p> Reaching down for Bentz 's crutch , Montoya said , " Maybe you could retire , draw a pension , and then get your P.I . ' s license . " <p> " Yeah ... maybe . And you can keep babysitting . " Ignoring the preoffered crutch , Bentz started inside , the little dog hurrying ahead of him . " Come on , I 'll buy you a beer . " <p> " Have you gone off the wagon ? " Montoya was right beside him , hauling the damned crutch . <p> " Not yet . " Bentz held the door open . " But then , the day 's not over . " <p> Chapter Two Bentz was slipping away from her . <p> Olivia could feel it . <p> And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , she thought as she tore down the road in her old Ford Ranger , a relic with nearly two hundred thousand miles that she would have to trade in soon . <p> She loved her husband and when she 'd vowed to stick with him through good times and bad , she 'd meant it . She 'd thought he had , too , but ever since the accident ... <p> She braked for a curve on the long country road winding through this part of bayou country on the way to her home , a small bungalow built near the swamp , one she 'd shared with Grannie Gin before the old lady had passed on . She 'd lived in it alone for a few years , but eventually , when she and Bentz had married , he 'd moved from his apartment to the bungalow tucked deep into the woods . <p> His daughter had lived with them for a while , though that had n't worked out all that great . Kristi was a grown woman and had needed her own space . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Until the damned accident . <p> A freak occurrence . <p> Lightning had cleaved an oak tree and a thick branch had come down on Rick , pinning him and nearly severing his spine . Even now she shuddered thinking of those dark days when she had n't been certain whether he would live or die . <p> He 'd clung to life . Barely . And in that time she and her stepdaughter had finally bonded , clenching each other 's hands in the hospital when the doctors had given Bentz a dire prognosis . <p> She 'd thought she 'd lose him , expected him to die . And in those heart-rending days , she 'd regretted not having a child with him , not having a part of him to carry on . Maybe it was selfish . But she did n't care . <p> She caught a glimpse of her reflection in the rearview mirror . Worried amber-colored eyes stared back at her . She did n't like what was happening . <p> " So do something about it , " she said . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been described as " mercurial " on more than one occasion . By Bentz . The first time she 'd met the man , she 'd gone toe-to-toe with him , reporting a murder she 'd witnessed though her visions . That had set him back a bit . He had n't believed her , at first . But she 'd convinced him . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
