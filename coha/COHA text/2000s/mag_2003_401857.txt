I usually choose a recipe from my favorite bartending book , Paradise on Ice . I pick up whatever ingredients I need on the way home ( say , some exotic fruits , like lychee , for a Bali Highball or fresh spearmint leaves for a classic Mojito ) . Then I leave the cocktail shaker and strainer on the kitchen counter-along with an invitation for my husband to find when he comes home from work telling him to meet me in the backyard for drinks .

Between the waitstaff 's European accents and all the finger licking and hand-feeding ( which seems par for the course during this unique meal ) , we always end up having a sultry good time . " 4 " I ordered a Lover 's Spa Kit from loverschoice.tv and surprised my guy by suggesting we spend our Saturday date night in the bathroom .

We cover the lamps with scarves , light scented candles and incense , and put fresh flowers in the room . We also keep chocolate-covered strawberries , a bottle of our favorite wine , and a basket of massage oils nearby . For a few hours our ordinary room is turned into our own sensual play space . " 7 " On our last run-of-the-mill date night ( dinner at a local pizza joint ) , my husband got a little creative by bringing along a book called The Art of Kissing : Book of Questions and Answers . We had a laugh reading about unusual kissing styles ( like the " electric kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth on a carpet before you touch lips ) over dinner , and then had a sexy night trying them out once we got back home . " 8 " I get my husband all pumped up for our date early in the week by sending him an electronic invite via sendomatic.com . Aside from giving him the time and location , I am sure to drop plenty of hints about the afterparty in the bedroom : The anticipation really makes an ordinary night out much more alluring . " 9 " Our hottest date : dinner at a raw bar downtown . We order oysters on the half shell as an aphrodisiac and a bottle of champagne for elegance . " 10 " To add a seductive touch to our dinners out , I sometimes slip my shoe off under the dinner table while we are eating .

After that he usually comes up with an excuse to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 " A local hangout occasionally books a cover band my husband and I loved when we were first dating . Whenever one of us spots the listing in the paper , we make sure to plan a date and get there early enough to request a live version of " our " song . Dancing to it together always brings us right back to when we first met. " 12 " We hold " his ' or " hers " nights ( which are set in motion when one of us lays out one of the cheesy monogrammed towels we were given as a wedding gift ) . If my husband lays out the " hers " towel , for instance , he 's in charge of planning a night that revolves entirely around me : from my favorite restaurant and entertainment ( a game of pool ) to what I love in bed ! It 's how we indulge our love for each other . " 13 " My husband and I felt obliged to check out a neighbor 's performance in a production of Les Miserables at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , we started passing sassy notes back and forth .

I do n't know who was more shockedand turned on-by the secret sex suggestions , my husband or me. " 14 " We always book an all-night sitter whenever there 's a full moon . Why ? So we can spend the night out in our boat on the river . The water is beautifully lit by the moon , giving us the perfect atmosphere for skinny-dipping. " 15 " It 's not what we do when we go out , it 's the ritual we perform when we get home . I peel off my clothes while my man runs a bath . Then he sits on the side of the tub and washes me from head to toe . " 16 " We center a few stay-at-home dates around checking out the latest sex-advice book .

Neither one of us is a great artist , but that never stops us from taking turns practicing our drawing while the other acts as a private model-in the nude . " 18 " The main stars of our sexiest nights out : my red backless cocktail dress and a pair of strappy stilettos that he simply ca n't resist . " 19 " To get our adrenaline going just before we go out , I roll up the carpet in the living room , dim the lights , crank the CD player to a mix of our favorite dance tunes , and start dancing solo . My husband usually comes rushing in to watch me , and after a song or two he ca n't help but join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a masseuse from our gym every Friday night at eight in our home . She meets us for personal massages in our living room , where we take turns choosing soothing music to play in the background and talking about the upcoming weekend .
