I. <p> My wife , Rita , has been having these dreams in which relatives arbitrarily appear and either ask her to get inside something-a car , a slowly moving train , a brightly lit room that seems unattached to any larger structure-or implore her to let them enter a room or some other place , fixed or moveable ( an elevator , for example ) , that she already occupies . They are persistent and insistent , occasionally disingenuous in their logic , but never fearsome in the traditional way we ( most of us ) think of unwelcome ghosts as being . All of the relatives in question happen to be dead . <p> Rita finally calls her mother in Lima , Peru , and tells her what 's been going on in her dreams . Her mother audibly sighs and says , " You know what they 're trying to do , do n't you ? " <p> " No , why do n't you tell me . " Rita 's like that-sarcastic in the face of well-intended advice . <p> " Is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with them . Pull you over to the other side . " <p> " Jesus , Mami , give me a break . " She hangs up on her mother . <p> Her mother is eighty-two and in failing health : high blood pressure , cataracts , diabetes . She lives her life on two major fronts , church and television , with the television half highlighted by two kinds of programming she finds quite addictive , one being religious shows about saints and miracles , the other spirited shows either homegrown in Peru or beamed in from Venezuela , Mexico , or Argentina , oily programs in which psychics and conversations with the dead are a daily staple and believers either phone in or appear live in studio , and the message to the living is to be aware of the presence of the dead but keep them at arm 's length when it comes to actual physical engagement . The hosts of these shows will constantly remind viewers that the dead are not without charm-anything but-and their complete lack of earthly striving and vanity can take you unawares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Her mother calls back within minutes . " Listen to me . Whatever you do , do n't go with them . Do n't let them in . Shut the door in their face . Tell them to suck a lemon . " <p> Uncle Oscar was the first to appear in Rita 's dreams . He was the mayor of a village high up in the Andes , just south of the city of Huancayo . The village sat between two scarred brown peaks , in an infertile valley of pebbly soil and dwarf fir trees . It was the height of the terrorism scourge in the sierra , and when the terrorists finally got around to Oscar 's monumentally insignificant village , they asked to see the mayor . The women weaving mats under a wooden lean-to scattered , dogs skulked , llamas stretched their necks and looked away . A fellow septuagenarian , Pablo , went to get Oscar . He found him in his bungalow , sleeping on his back on top of his low-to-the-ground bed , now too big and wide across without his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hands lay folded on top of his big belly , fingers caught up in ruby-colored rosary beads that had fallen across his midsection like spilled molecules . " A group of men are here to see the mayor , " his friend Pablo told him excitedly . Oscar rose up on his elbows . Blood rushing to his head made him momentarily dizzy . " Here to see me ? " Oscar said . " Are n't you the mayor ? " Pablo said with high seriousness . " Is there another one ? " They laughed . Oscar brightened at the concept of finally acting in the official capacity to which he had been so judiciously appointed years before by a committee of village elders ; a seed of foolish pride bloomed inside him . He put on his best shirt , a long-sleeved white cotton shirt with vertical blue stripes sewn so delicately that he used to worry that they 'd slide off . He arranged the cuffs just so , flaps folded back like corn husks so his wristwatch-a very fine black-faced Timex-would be revealed . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got buffed with an oil rag . After slicking back his thinning white hair with wheel grease , he stepped out into a great chasm of sunshine . <p> There were six men , all dressed in quasi-army-fatigue outfits , a few with black boots , a few wearing white sneakers , gathered in a semicircle in what passed for the town plaza but was actually the only intersection formed by the crossing of the village 's only two streets . Long hair fell out from their caps onto their shoulders . Beards of varying lengths and shades obscured their faces . They asked the mayor to stand before them and to address them from a certain distance in order to afford the entire group a good , clean view of him . Oscar was only too happy to oblige . Only five feet five inches tall , he preferred to step back from people and gain at least a small measure of vertical evenness . " What brings you to our village ? " he said . <p> " You 're the mayor of this ? " one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garcia del Doral , " he answered firmly . <p> The first sign that something was off came from the man standing at the far left , who lifted up his poncho and pulled out something small and shiny , like a silver fish . At the far edge of his vision Oscar caught the thing glinting in the air , turning like a leaf in the wind . Undeterred , he continued . " If you 're here for market day , that 's in three days . But we have things for sale we can show you now . Rugs . Coats . A new batch of chuyos . " The others lifted dark objects out of long narrow bags , the kind you might keep fishing gear in , shucking the bags off like dead skin once the objects were fully removed . The tallest one stepped forward . " The revolutionary council finds you guilty of imperialist crimes and sentences you to death , " he said in clear , carefully calibrated Quechua , the native language of that part of the Peruvian sierra . They shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skinny birds pecking at the dirt flying in all directions like confetti . <p> A few days after this story was relayed in a letter from Rita 's cousin Gloria , Oscar started appearing in Rita 's dreams , always acting out the same scene , showing up at our back door wearing a blood-splattered white shirt and holding a bouquet of birds of paradise . The not-quite-fresh flowers jut out from the cylindrical newspaper wrapping like baby bird heads , their pointy beaks and orange-yellow markings making them look almost predatory . " May I come in , little Rita ? Please . Just for a moment to put these in water . " <p> He always tries to look behind her into the well-lit kitchen . She always blocks his view . <p> " I ca n't let you in . " <p> " Of course you can . " He hoists up the flowers , smiles sheepishly . <p> She shakes her head , starts backing away . <p> " Are you cooking something ? What 's that smell ? Aji ? Coriander ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry . I have a long trip back on the bus . " <p> The door closes , but he remains standing there , a slumped silhouette clutching flowers . <p> The Uncle Oscar dream has begun getting interspersed with one featuring her cousin Raul , who died in a motorcycle accident on a particularly nasty stretch of Pan-American Highway just south of the city of Arequipa . Actually , he was drag racing an equally stupid , far luckier boy , who survived a spark-spitting skid of fifty feet on his own bike and managed to land , once thrown , in a bank of sand . The dream starts with Raul pulling into our driveway on his motorcycle . The identical raised ranch houses across the street , inky blue in the darkness , get striped briefly by his headlight . Hearing the low rumble of his motor , Rita gets out of bed and squats in front of our second-floor bedroom window directly overlooking the driveway , partially and deliberately unseen , until her cousin looks up and sees the illuminated outline of the familiar face suspended between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumbs-up . <p> We have a severely sloping driveway ruined by fissures and cracks , the most prominent one starting near the top and wending its way down to the very bottom where the macadam flattens out amid clefts and indentations that collect rainwater and scraps of windblown paper . If our driveway were a person 's palm , the fortune would be too fucked up to read . The motorcycle seems to be barely clinging to its position mid-driveway , halfway up the rise , like a spider on a wall . Rita walks out the front door in her nightgown , and the air , shockingly cold , takes her breath away . <p> " Get on , " her cousin says in Spanish . His face is partially hidden by sunglasses and a moving phalanx of shadows . <p> " No , " my wife says emphatically . <p> He pats the seat cushion behind him , then jiggers the handle-bars so the engine revs up to a throaty peak . <p> " Go away , Raul . " <p> " Come for a ride , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me-tu y yo . " <p> The dream always ends just as he puts out his hand , and she , whether in a gesture to rebuff or receive it , puts out hers . <p> She keeps having more dreams . In one , she 's on an elevator that stops at the top floor , always the top , and as soon as the doors open her ancient aunt Dora tries to get on , costume jewelry rattling , spotted hands trembling , flooding the elevator with her over-applied Chanel perfume , her one indulgence in an otherwise ascetic and asexual life , and Rita presses the close button just as Dora opens her arms to embrace her . In another , a door opens to reveal a blindingly bright room filled with clouds and patches of open sky , with her father , who died when she was nine , standing by the door in a business suit and smiling at her , beckoning her to come in . In another , she hears music , the flutter of a badly played piano , and comes downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not our house ) to find her grandmother wearing a bright pink bathrobe and playing the piano with one wrinkled hand while she signals Rita with the other to sit down on the bench next to her and join her in a duet . <p> II . <p> Rita is just over five feet tall , with black hair she keeps boyishly short now , and every Monday night she takes a Kwon Do class with other small women who might have a need to defend themselves someday , and every Tuesday night she 's part of a support group for the wives and significant others of alcoholics , though she says , quite rightly , that if I had a support group of my own she would n't have the need for hers . This morning , she decided that as punishment for my drinking the night before , she was going to let me oversleep , which I do , badly , waking up at nearly two o'clock in the afternoon with my head feeling as though it 's going to burst like an unopened can in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the toilet seat with the presumption that it will be read at eye level by someone down on his knees , she 's written in big blocky letters , " ASSHOLE . " <p> When I call her at work , the receptionist tells me that she just that minute ran down the hallway by the side of a gurney carrying an old Puerto Rican man who was brought in after suffering a heart attack . Rita works in the emergency room at the local hospital as a translator for Spanish-speaking patients , going Spanish-English or English-Spanish , depending on who 's talking and who 's listening , explaining forms , insurance , how something happened or how something will be cured , or not . The hardest part , she says , is dealing with the hopeless cases and the tragic diagnoses , not just because of the brutal unchangeable facts , but because the words no one wants to hear are always coming out of her mouth and she ca n't help feeling that somehow she is complicit with the terrible news . She 's well practiced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can do . " No hay nada que puedan hacer . <p> A half-hour later I get her on the phone . <p> " How 's the old man who had the heart attack ? " <p> " He died . " <p> " Sorry . " I let the word hang there , like maybe it 'll magically stretch itself to cover other things as well . I learned a long time ago not to fumble around with hollow apologies about my behavior , or throw out promises I 'll never keep . <p> " I have to go , his wife 's here , " she says , and hangs up . <p> I 'm sitting in the kitchen , looking out on a gray sky that wants to rain . The house is deadly quiet-we have no children , no pets-and the day is slipping away from me ; it 's too late to head over to the office building where I 've been doing freelance work on the communications systems , installing Rolm phones and fine-tuning the T-1 line . Phones are my thing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , climbing up poles forty feet high , looking out over rooftops and treetops and highways , strapped inside a kind of heavy-duty canvas straightjacket riveted by rope to the ascending spikes , wrapping my legs around the pole while I hooked cable , twisted wire , and installed connectors , finally graduating to more sophisticated power box monitoring that involved the precision and nerve of a heart surgeon until a crazy fear of falling , accidentally or deliberately , gradually overtook me and I could n't go up anymore without this overpowering feeling of dread . My drinking started taking some bad turns , and one day I was up in the sky rewiring a transformer when my entire body including my fingers and facial muscles froze , causing me to drop a screwdriver and a spool of coaxial wire . The spotters on the ground yelled up to me , but I could n't respond . They finally had to bring in a crane with a landing platform so two guys could go up and pry me loose , finally laying me down on the platform and bringing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I worked for a couple of companies doing internal phone system build-out and maintenance , but things like irregularities in my arrival time and using up all my sick days faster than I should have led them to put me on probation , and then slight violations of the probation rules , microscopic things like falling asleep in the switch room , forced them to let me go . After that , I decided to be my own boss and start my own business , so I formed a limited liability company , an LLC called WW ( my initials ) Communications , complete with a logo I designed myself where the W 's look like sound waves and the peaks of each letter are in the form of cellular towers . <p> I get in the car and drive over to the 400 Club , a restaurant and bar about a mile from our house . I take a seat at the curved bar , as far away from the television as I can get , and nod my silent hello to Chris the bartender . He 's forty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talker , which I like , and his red face seems to have one expression only , which is pleasant blankness , a fact I also appreciate . I shoot through three Jim Beams , pay the tab , and go . The air outside is cool and a little sticky ; an almost imaginary rain has begun to fall , a fine , invisible mist that feels like tiny bugs crawling all over your skin . <p> She stays away from me when she gets home . We each fend for ourselves for dinner ; she eats hummus and saltines in the darkened dining room with a magazine ; I eat a cheese sandwich in front of the bay window that faces the street , looking at nothing . <p> From time to time she steals quick glances at me . Rita has constructed , over the years , some very elaborate metaphors to describe my drinking : drowning at the bottom of a pool that has no water , falling down the elevator shaft of a half-built building ( this once happened to a schoolmate of hers in Lima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks that get added one at a time every time I take a drink , being in a bullfight where I 'm the matador and the bull at the same time , baiting my own nature , getting gored by my own dark impulses . As accurate as these are , I prefer her latest one-a car with no brakes , rolling downhill . I like the pure simplicity of that . <p> She goes up to bed . <p> Most nights , I sit downstairs and drink ten , twelve cans of beer . I 'm always very careful to put them in a trash bag and put the bag in the trunk of my car , so when Rita comes down in the morning there 's no mountain of empties . Tonight , I 'm not feeling quite right , a little sapped of energy , so I stop drinking after maybe four cans and go upstairs . Rita 's already asleep , knees drawn up , head tucked in so only the wedge containing her eyes and the bridge of her nose is visible above the blanket line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fending off a minor irritant or a sour aftertaste . I lie down next to her , far enough away so we 're not touching , close enough so I get the waves of her body heat , the fruity smell of her hair . <p> In the middle of the night , I wake up with a corkscrew sensation in my chest , just under my breastbone , and a tingling in my left arm . My legs feel heavy , like they 're waterlogged . I try to stand , as a test , but my legs give way and I crash to the floor , in the narrow space between the bed and the wall . <p> Rita calls 911 . They come upstairs , put me on a stretcher , and drive me to the hospital through a steady rain that beads the big back windows of the ambulance . I 'm lying with my head at fore and my feet at aft , taking in the nighttime sights through the streaked windows , watching the familiar sub shops and gas station islands and home improvement store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench up near my head , to the left of the EMS guy who 's fiddling with the tubes and gears . <p> " You bastard , " she says softly . " You did this to yourself . " <p> The EMS guy pretends not to hear , pretends to take a reading of one of the monitors . <p> When we arrive at the hospital , the night shifters come up to Rita and ask her what she 's doing back at the emergency room-you just could n't stay away , huh , that kind of thing . They wheel me right into a private room , cordoned off by blue plastic curtains . When they determine conclusively that it 's not a heart attack , one part of me is acutely disappointed , since the concentration and fear of having to deal with that would probably shock me into at least temporary rectitude , but the bigger part of me lies back and sighs , another bullet dodged . For a few hours , I lie in one of the emergency-room bays , hooked to an IV and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed in a folding chair , watching me with this silent and steely expression . She does n't talk . Time passes . Boredom kicks in . Then some activity starts up . Suddenly there 's a lot of buzzing and people drifting in and out of the room . My vision is a bit watery ; it 's like I 'm watching things through a foggy lens . <p> " There seems to be some kind of internal bleeding going on , " one of the doctors says . " That 's good-I mean it 's good that we found it , that we know it 's happening , that you 're here while it 's happening . Now all we have to do is see where it 's originating from and what 's causing it . " <p> There are three or four bodies standing around my bed , and I 'm amazed by the speed and surety of their hands flying in this direction and that . " Mr. Wenger , " a different male voice says , " we 're going to give you something to relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of a radio playing that thin metallic instrumental music that 's the bane of public places everywhere . When I ask to see my wife , they tell me that she went home to get some sleep , that she 'll be back . But really , they say , there 's no reason to keep me-the bleeding was not really significant internal bleeding , just some small flow from a hemorrhoid that was just enough to cause discoloration . I 'm free to go . My clothes , shoes , wallet , and watch are in the closet behind me . Discharge papers are ready . <p> I take a taxi home . When I get there , the front door 's locked . Since I do n't have my keys , I ring the bell . After I 'm not sure how many minutes , I hear the lock turning . She opens the door part-way and gives me a look ; her eyes are puffy , the lids all swelled up like inverted seashells . All the lights in the house seem to be on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls that almost seem on fire with light , but she shifts her lean to the other side of the doorway , blocking my view . It 's then that I produce the roses and wave them under her nose . <p> I had the taxi stop so I could buy some flowers on the way home-albeit some inferior convenience store roses , the ones with the small shriveled bulbs that may or may not open up , but that 's the chance you get when you buy flowers at Store 24 . <p> I brandish the dwarf roses . " These are for you . " <p> She does that thing where she fixes her eyes on some distant nonexistent object , like she 's willing to focus on anything but what 's right in front of her . <p> " Come on , Reetie , " I say . " Let me in . " <p> The gaze drops down to where I 'm standing . The door opens wider . <p> Her mother calls just after dawn and warns her daughter to resist any impulse for foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the visitors in her dreams . Promise me you wo n't go with them , she says . How can I promise what I might do in some stupid dream ? Rita says , and her mother repeats , Promise me . <p> Ten years ago , when I was twenty-five , getting ready to push off from shore , I went to Peru on a charter . There were a bunch of cheap vacations to exotic-sounding places-Senegal , the Canary Islands , Patagonia-but I chose Peru . On the third day , I walked across the street from the hotel in Lima to buy a USA Today in one of the newspaper kiosks , and I saw a woman coming down the sidewalk , wearing a Boston Red Sox hat . It was Rita . I stopped her . I said , " I 'm from Boston . " <p> I put off my return on the next charter going back . What did I have to return to , anyway ? I found out where she worked , and every evening when she walked out of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One day , Rita said to me in that supremely defiant and knowing tone of hers , " I 'm not going to marry you and watch you drink yourself to death . " I remember exactly where we were , sitting in a cafe one block off of Lima 's Plaza de Armas , wind blowing our crepe-material napkins into the street , shivering waiters hovering in ill-fitted black cloth jackets with frayed epaulets on their shoulders and soiled white towels slung over their arms . Lima 's one of those cities where every restaurant , every church , every statue , seems some ways past its prime . We had known each other for a month , long enough for me to fall in love and for her to get the full scope of what a massive reclamation project I would turn out to be . I reached across the table and scooped up her small dry hand ; when she did n't try to wrest it free , I knew I was in the clear . It was n't that I did n't take her threat seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were in her shoes . It was just that for the first and last time in my life I had a clear vision of what the future foretold , and in it there was an unmistakable version of the two of us , hurtling together across this great yawning divide of time . I was as sure of it as anything I 'd ever known . And I was right . Give me credit for that . She did marry me . She did watch . <p>
