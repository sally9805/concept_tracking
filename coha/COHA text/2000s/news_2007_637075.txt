<p> Zach Bobowski and Nick Ford commanded a small audience of family , friends and teachers at their high school libraries on Friday . <p> They spoke gracious words , then signed letters of intent to play basketball at the University of Alabama . <p> By most measures , it was the typical signing-day scene , proudly replayed many times in Georgia high schools each year . But as student-athletes , Bobowski and Ford are not typical . They are pioneers . <p> Bobowski , a senior at South Forsyth High in Cumming , is a paraplegic . Ford , a senior at Dutchtown High in Hampton , is a single-leg amputee . <p> They 're the only wheelchair athletes from Georgia high schools getting the chance to play college sports next year , and they 're among only a half-dozen in state history . <p> " I never thought I 'd be a college athlete , " Ford said . " I tried out for my high school basketball team in the 10th grade , did n't make it , and figured I was done with sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been the case , but doors are opening . Ten colleges in the U.S. offer wheelchair basketball competition . Alabama became the first in the Southeast to do so in 2003 . <p> And Georgia is considering the possibility . <p> Georgia 's House recently passed a resolution that would form a committee to study in-state intercollegiate opportunities for disabled athletes . <p> One of the sponsors of House Resolution 322 , now before the Senate , is Bob Smith ( R-Watkinsville ) , who remembers his days as a hearing-impaired high school basketball player in Georgia . Smith 's coach would flash cue cards to let him know the plays . <p> " Anytime you have a handicap , you 're looking for a champion or a role model , and this is a step in that direction , " he said . " We 're not trying to mandate anything , just seeing if we can give a hand up to people who have limited opportunities . " <p> Brent Hardin , the director of Alabama 's wheelchair teams , says legislative action probably is necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got back from junior nationals , and there are hundreds of kids who are top-notch , but we do n't have enough programs for them , " Hardin said . " I do n't think women 's athletics would 've progressed without Title IX . " <p> Hardin got his master 's degree in adaptive education from the University of Georgia in 1996 . He began teaching at Alabama in 2003 , but his real dream was to start a wheelchair sports program at the school . <p> Hardin found a friend in University of Alabama President Dr. Robert Witt , whose previous post was head of the University of Texas at Arlington , a leader in wheelchair sports . <p> Alabama 's teams get their funding  --  about $200,000 per year  --  from the university 's College of Education . The NCAA does n't sanction wheelchair sports . <p> Only a couple of programs fall under their schools ' athletics departments , so most athletes do not get true sports scholarships . Many still pay substantial sums out of pocket , Hardin said . <p> Bobowski and Ford are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and books will be handled through federal vocational rehabilitation funds and other academic- or needs-based assistance . <p> The scholarship also provides custom-made competition wheelchairs , about a $2,500 expense . Call it a full ride . <p> " It 's like a shoe contract , " Hardin said . " We have a sponsor who makes chairs , and there 's this whole subculture in wheelchair sports of junior athletes who see our players in these chairs , and they want to be like them . " <p> Since 2003 , the Georgia High School Association has been the only state governing body of its kind to make wheelchair basketball a part of its state basketball tournament , according to the American Association of Adapted Sports Programs ( AAASP ) . The AAASP runs Georgia 's high school league , which is coed and has about 50 players on nine teams that represent entire school systems or geographic areas throughout the state . <p> If Georgia 's colleges embrace wheelchair sports , it would n't be the first time . In 2000 , Georgia State started the nation 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant money dried up , Hardin said . <p> One of the players was Karin Korb , the director of community relations for Blaze Sports Georgia , which helped develop Bobowski and Ford into scholarship-winning athletes . <p> Four other Blaze Sports Georgia alumni have signed sports scholarships the past two years , including basketball players Dana Fink of North Springs and Cully Mason of Walton Academy ( both to Illinois ) ; Tommie Gray of Warner Robins ( Edinboro ) , and rugby player Kurt Lawton of Greenbrier ( Arizona ) . <p> A two-time Paralympian , Korb wishes the athletes would have had the chance to stay in-state . She called her own college sports experience " life-changing . " <p> " It created a sense of self beyond my disability , " she said . " I was so proud of being a Panther . You 're held to a higher standard of care and respect when you 're a student-athlete . " <p> Bobowski , who has spina bifida , has played wheelchair basketball through the Blaze Sports program , a legacy of the 1996 Atlanta Paralympics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made the under-20 national team that won the Australian National Junior Games in Sydney . <p> " One of my main athletic goals is to make it to the Paralympics , and being on a college team , I 'll learn skills I need to make it , " Bobowski said . <p> Ford is relatively new to the sport and probably would not have discovered it had he not failed to make Dutchtown 's varsity basketball team . <p> " I did n't feel the coach looked at my skill level , " Ford said . " He saw my prosthesis . " <p> With that denial , however , another door opened . <p> Ford 's shooting and speed in the chair turned heads last year in a national tournament in Houston , where college coaches scout and make their pitches . <p> Ford was startled to be invited to Edinboro in Pennsylvania for an expenses-paid recruiting visit . He took the trip but settled on Alabama to be closer to home . <p> That pleased Ford 's step-mother , Veronica Ford , who was a track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment she and her husband , Ernesto , admit they never envisioned . <p> " This brings tears to my eyes , " Veronica said . " I was a very hard worker who took sports to heart , but they have so many more obstacles than I did . Able-bodied athletes , those making money , they should come watch these kids . "
