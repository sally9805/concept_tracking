In 1958 , Beaufort , North Carolina , which is located on the coast near Morehead City , was a place like many other small southern towns . It was the kind of place where the humidity rose so high in the summer that walking out to get the mail made a person feel as if he needed a shower , and kids walked around barefoot from April through October beneath oak trees draped in Spanish moss . People waved from their cars whenever they saw someone on the street whether they knew him or not , and the air smelled of pine , salt , and sea , a scent unique to the Carolinas . For many of the people there , fishing in the Pamlico Sound or crabbing in the Neuse River was a way of life , and boats were moored wherever you saw the Intracoastal Waterway . Only three channels came in on the television , though television was never important to those of us who grew up there . Instead our lives were centered around the churches , of which there were eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Fellowship Hall Christian Church , the Church of the Forgiven People , the Church of Sunday Atonement , and then , of course , there were the Baptist churches . When I was growing up , it was far and away the most popular denomination around , and there were Baptist churches on practically every corner of town , though each considered itself superior to the others . There were Baptist churches of every typeFreewill Baptists , Southern Baptists , Congregational Baptists , Missionary Baptists , Independent Baptists . . . well , you get the picture . Back then , the big event of the year was sponsored by the Baptist church downtownSouthern , if youreally want to knowin conjunction with the local high school . Every year they put on their Christmas pageant at the Beaufort Playhouse , which was actually a play that had been written by Hegbert Sullivan , a minister who 'd been with the church since Moses parted the Red Sea . Okay , maybe he was n't that old , but he was old enough that you could almost see through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , and translucentkids would swear they actually saw the blood flowing through his veinsand his hair was as white as those bunnies you see in pet stores around Easter . Anyway , he wrote this play called The Christmas Angel , because he did n't want to keep on performing that old Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol . In his mind Scrooge was a heathen , who came to his redemption only because he saw ghosts , not angelsand who was to say whether they 'd been sent by God , anyway ? And who was to say he would n't revert to his sinful ways if they had n't been sent directly from heaven ? The play did n't exactly tell you in the endit sort of plays into faith and allbut Hegbert did n't trust ghosts if they were n't actually sent by God , which was n't explained in plain language , and this was his big problem with it . A few years back he 'd changed the end of the playsort of followed it up with his own version , complete with old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jerusalem to find the place where Jesus once taught the scribes . It did n't fly too wellnot even to the congregation , who sat in the audience staring wide-eyed at the spectacleand the newspaper said things like " Though it was certainly interesting , it was n't exactly the play we 've all come to know and love . . . . " So Hegbert decided to try his hand at writing his own play . He 'd written his own sermons his whole life , and some of them , we had to admit , were actually interesting , especially when he talked about the " wrath of God coming down on the fornicators " and all that good stuff . That really got his blood boiling , I 'll tell you , when he talked about the fornicators . That was his real hot spot . When we were younger , my friends and I would hide behind the trees and shout , " Hegbert is a fornicator ! " when we saw him walking down the street , and we 'd giggle like idiots , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old Hegbert , he 'd stop dead in his tracks and his ears would perk upI swear to God , they actually movedand he 'd turn this bright shade of red , like he 'd just drunk gasoline , and the big green veins in his neck would start sticking out all over , like those maps of the Amazon River that you see in National Geographic . He 'd peer from side to side , his eyes narrowing into slits as he searched for us , and then , just as suddenly , he 'd start to go pale again , back to that fishy skin , right before our eyes . Boy , it was something to watch , that 's for sure . So we 'd be hiding behind a tree and Hegbert ( what kind of parents name their kid Hegbert , anyway ? ) would stand there waiting for us to give ourselves up , as if he thought we 'd be that stupid . We 'd put our hands over our mouths to keep from laughing out loud , but somehow he 'd always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to side , and then he 'd stop , those beady eyes coming right at us , right through the tree . " I know who you are , Landon Carter , " he 'd say , " and the Lord knows , too . " He 'd let that sink in for a minute or so , and then he 'd finally head off again , and during the sermon that weekend he 'd stare right at us and say something like " God is merciful to children , but the children must be worthy as well . " And we 'd sort of lower ourselves in the seats , not from embarrassment , but to hide a new round of giggles . Hegbert did n't understand us at all , which was really sort of strange , being that he had a kid and all . But then again , she was a girl . More on that , though , later . Anyway , like I said , Hegbert wrote The Christmas Angel one year and decided to put on that play instead . The play itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year it was performed . It 's basically the story of a man who had lost his wife a few years back . This guy , Tom Thornton , used to be real religious , but he had a crisis of faith after his wife died during childbirth . He 's raising this little girl all on his own , but he has n't been the greatest father , and what the little girl really wants for Christmas is a special music box with an angel engraved on top , a picture of which she 'd cut out from an old catalog . The guy searches long and hard to find the gift , but he ca n't find it anywhere . So it 's Christmas Eve and he 's still searching , and while he 's out looking through the stores , he comes across a strange woman he 's never seen before , and she promises to help him find the gift for his daughter . First , though , they help this homeless person ( back then they were called bums , by the way ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then visit a lonely old woman who just wanted some company on Christmas Eve . At this point the mysterious woman asks Tom Thornton what he wants for Christmas , and he says that he wants his wife back . She brings him to the city fountain and tells him to look in the water and he 'll find what he 's looking for . When he looks in the water , he sees the face of his little girl , and he breaks down and cries right there . While he 's sobbing , the mysterious lady runs off , and Tom Thornton searches but ca n't find her anywhere . Eventually he heads home , the lessons from the evening playing in his mind . He walks into his little girl 's room , and her sleeping figure makes him realize that she 's all he has left of his wife , and he starts to cry again because he knows he has n't been a good enough father to her . The next morning , magically , the music box is underneath the tree , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman he 'd seen the night before . So it was n't that bad , really . If truth be told , people cried buckets whenever they saw it . The play sold out every year it was performed , and due to its popularity , Hegbert eventually had to move it from the church to the Beaufort Playhouse , which had a lot more seating . By the time I was a senior in high school , the performances ran twice to packed houses , which , considering who actually performed it , was a story in and of itself . You see , Hegbert wanted young people to perform the playseniors in high school , not the theater group . I reckon he thought it would be a good learning experience before the seniors headed off to college and came face-to-face with all the fornicators . He was that kind of guy , you know , always wanting to save us from temptation . He wanted us to know that God is out there watching you , even when you 're away from home , and that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the end . It was a lesson that I would eventually learn in time , though it was n't Hegbert who taught me . As I said before , Beaufort was fairly typical as far as southern towns went , though it did have an interesting history . Blackbeard the pirate once owned a house there , and his ship , Queen Anne 's Revenge , is supposedly buried somewhere in the sand just offshore . Recently some archaeologists or oceanographers or whoever looks for stuff like that said they found it , but no one 's certain just yet , being that it sank over 250 years ago and you ca n't exactly reach into the glove compartment and check the registration . Beaufort 's come a long way since the 1950s , but it 's still not exactly a major metropolis or anything . Beaufort was , and always will be , on the smallish side , but when I was growing up , it barely warranted a place on the map . To put it into perspective , the congressional district that included Beaufort covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't a single town with more than twenty-five thousand people . Even compared with those towns , Beaufort was regarded as being on the small side . Everything east of Raleigh and north of Wilmington , all the way to the Virginia border , was the district my father represented . I suppose you 've heard of him . He 's sort of a legend , even now . His name is Worth Carter , and he was a congressman for almost thirty years . His slogan every other year during the election season was " Worth Carter represents , " and the person was supposed to fill in the city name where he or she lived . I can remember , driving on trips when me and Mom had to make our appearances to show the people he was a true family man , that we 'd see those bumper stickers , stenciled in with names like Otway and Chocawinity and Seven Springs . Nowadays stuff like that would n't fly , but back then that was fairly sophisticated publicity . I imagine if he tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foul language in the blank space , but we never saw it once . Okay , maybe once . A farmer from Duplin County once wrote the word shit in the blank space , and when my mom saw it , she covered my eyes and said a prayer asking for forgiveness for the poor ignorant bastard . She did n't say exactly those words , but I got the gist of it . So my father , Mr. Congressman , was a bigwig , and everyone but everyone knew it , including old man Hegbert . Now , the two of them did n't get along , not at all , despite the fact that my father went to Hegbert 's church whenever he was in town , which to be frank was n't all that often . Hegbert , in addition to his belief that fornicators were destined to clean the urinals in hell , also believed that communism was " a sickness that doomed mankind to heathenhood . " Even though heathenhood was n't a wordI ca n't find it in any dictionarythe congregation knew what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words specifically to my father , who would sit with his eyes closed and pretend not to listen . My father was on one of the House committees that oversaw the " Red influence " supposedly infiltrating every aspect of the country , including national defense , higher education , and even tobacco farming . You have to remember that this was during the cold war ; tensions were running high , and we North Carolinians needed something to bring it down to a more personal level . My father had consistently looked for facts , which were irrelevant to people like Hegbert . Afterward , when my father would come home after the service , he 'd say something like " Reverend Sullivan was in rare form today . I hope you heard that part about the Scripture where Jesus was talking about the poor . . . . " Yeah , sure , Dad . . . . My father tried to defuse situations whenever possible . I think that 's why he stayed in Congress for so long . The guy could kiss the ugliest babies known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's such a gentle child , " he 'd say when a baby had a giant head , or , " I 'll bet she 's the sweetest girl in the world , " if she had a birthmark over her entire face . One time a lady showed up with a kid in a wheelchair . My father took one look at him and said , " I 'll bet you ten to one that you 're smartest kid in your class . " And he was ! Yeah , my father was great at stuff like that . He could fling it with the best of ' em , that 's for sure . And he was n't such a bad guy , not really , especially if you consider the fact that he did n't beat me or anything . But he was n't there for me growing up . I hate to say that because nowadays people claim that sort of stuff even if their parent was around and use it to excuse their behavior . My dad . . . he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stripper and performed on The Jerry Springer Show . . . . I 'm not using it to excuse the person I 've become , I 'm simply saying it as a fact . My father was gone nine months of the year , living out of town in a Washington , D.C. , apartment three hundred miles away . My mother did n't go with him because both of them wanted me to grow up " the same way they had . " Of course , my father 's father took him hunting and fishing , taught him to play ball , showed up for birthday parties , all that small stuff that adds up to quite a bit before adulthood . My father , on the other hand , was a stranger , someone I barely knew at all . For the first five years of my life I thought all fathers lived somewhere else . It was n't until my best friend , Eric Hunter , asked me in kindergarten who that guy was who showed up at my house the night before that I realized something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my father , " I said proudly . " Oh , " Eric said as he rifled through my lunchbox , looking for my Milky Way , " I did n't know you had a father . " Talk about something whacking you straight in the face . So , I grew up under the care of my mother . Now she was a nice lady , sweet and gentle , the kind of mother most people dream about . But she was n't , nor could she ever be , a manly influence in my life , and that fact , coupled with my growing disillusionment with my father , made me become something of a rebel , even at a young age . Not a bad one , mind you . Me and my friends might sneak out late and soap up car windows now and then or eat boiled peanuts in the graveyard behind the church , but in the fifties that was the kind of thing that made other parents shake their heads and whisper to their children , " You do n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track to prison . " Me . A bad boy . For eating boiled peanuts in the graveyard . Go figure . Anyway , my father and Hegbert did n't get along , but it was n't only because of politics . No , it seems that my father and Hegbert knew each other from way back when . Hegbert was about twenty years older than my father , and back before he was a minister , he used to work for my father 's father . My grandfathereven though he spent lots of time with my fatherwas a true bastard if there ever was one . He was the one , by the way , who made the family fortune , but I do n't want you to imagine him as the sort of man who slaved over his business , working diligently and watching it grow , prospering slowly over time . My grandfather was much shrewder than that . The way he made his money was simplehe started as a bootlegger , accumulating wealth throughout Prohibition by running rum up from Cuba . Then he began buying land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the money the sharecroppers made on their tobacco crop , then loaned them money whenever they needed it at ridiculous interest rates . Of course , he never intended to collect the moneyinstead he would foreclose on any land or equipment they happened to own . Then , in what he called " his moment of inspiration , " he started a bank called Carter Banking and Loan . The only other bank in a two-county radius had mysteriously burned down , and with the onset of the Depression , it never reopened . Though everyone knew what had really happened , not a word was ever spoken for fear of retribution , and their fear was well placed . The bank was n't the only building that had mysteriously burned down . His interest rates were outrageous , and little by little he began amassing more land and property as people defaulted on their loans . When the Depression hit hardest , he foreclosed on dozens of businesses throughout the county while retaining the original owners to continue to work on salary , paying them just enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to go . He told them that when the economy improved , he 'd sell their business back to them , and people always believed him . Never once , however , did he keep his promise . In the end he controlled a vast portion of the county 's economy , and he abused his clout in every way imaginable . I 'd like to tell you he eventually went to a terrible death , but he did n't . He died at a ripe-old age while sleeping with his mistress on his yacht off the Cayman Islands . He 'd outlived both his wives and his only son . Some end for a guy like that , huh ? Life , I 've learned , is never fair . If people teach anything in school , that should be it . But back to the story . . . . Hegbert , once he realized what a bastard my grandfather really was , quit working for him and went into the ministry , then came back to Beaufort and started ministering in the same church we attended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with monthly sermons on the evils of the greedy , and this left him scant time for anything else . He was forty-three before he ever got married ; he was fifty-five when his daughter , Jamie Sullivan , was born . His wife , a wispy little thing twenty years younger than he , went through six miscarriages before Jamie was born , and in the end she died in childbirth , making Hegbert a widower who had to raise a daughter on his own . Hence , of course , the story behind the play . People knew the story even before the play was first performed . It was one of those stories that made its rounds whenever Hegbert had to baptize a baby or attend a funeral . Everyone knew about it , and that 's why , I think , so many people got emotional whenever they saw the Christmas play . They knew it was based on something that happened in real life , which gave it special meaning . Jamie Sullivan was a senior in high school , just like me , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anyone else even had a chance . This , of course , made the play extra special that year . It was going to be a big deal , maybe the biggest everat least in Miss Garber 's mind . She was the drama teacher , and she was already glowing about the possibilities the first time I met her in class . Now , I had n't really planned on taking drama that year . I really had n't , but it was either that or chemistry II . The thing was , I thought it would be a blow-off class , especially when compared with my other option . No papers , no tests , no tables where I 'd have to memorize protons and neutrons and combine elements in their proper formulas . . . what could possibly be better for a high school senior ? It seemed like a sure thing , and when I signed up for it , I thought I 'd just be able to sleep through most every class , which , considering my late night peanut eating , was fairly important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was one of the last to arrive , coming in just a few seconds before the bell rang , and I took a seat in the back of the room . Miss Garber had her back turned to the class , and she was busy writing her name in big cursive letters , as if we did n't know who she was . Everyone knew herit was impossible not to . She was big , at least six feet two , with flaming red hair and pale skin that showed her freckles well into her forties . She was also overweightI 'd say honestly she pushed two fifty and she had a fondness for wearing flower-patterned muumuus . She had thick , dark , horn-rimmed glasses , and she greeted every one with , " Helloooooo , " sort of singing the last syllable . Miss Garber was one of a kind , that 's for sure , and she was single , which made it even worse . A guy , no matter how old , could n't help but feel sorry for a gal like her . Beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that year . " Self-confidence " was number one , followed by " Self-awareness " and , third , " Self-fulfillment . " Miss Garber was big into the " self " stuff , which put her really ahead of the curve as far as psychotherapy is concerned , though she probably did n't realize it at the time . Miss Garber was a pioneer in that field . Maybe it had something to do with the way she looked ; maybe she was just trying to feel better about herself . But I digress . It was n't until the class started that I noticed something unusual . Though Beaufort High School was n't large , I knew for a fact that it was pretty much split fifty-fifty between males and females , which was why I was surprised when I saw that this class was at least ninety percent female . There was only one other male in the class , which to my thinking was a good thing , and for a moment I felt flush with a " look out world , here I come " kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't help but think . Girls and girls and no tests in sight . Okay , so I was n't the most forward-thinking guy on the block . So Miss Garber brings up the Christmas play and tells everyone that Jamie Sullivan is going to be the angel that year . Miss Garber started clapping right awayshe was a member of the church , tooand there were a lot of people who thought she was gunning for Hegbert in a romantic sort of way . The first time I heard it , I remember thinking that it was a good thing they were too old to have children , if they ever did get together . Imaginetranslucent with freckles ? The very thought gave everyone shudders , but of course , no one ever said anything about it , at least within hearing distance of Miss Garber and Hegbert . Gossip is one thing , hurtful gossip is completely another , and even in high school we were n't that mean . Miss Garber kept on clapping , all alone for a while , until all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she wanted . " Stand up , Jamie , " she said . So Jamie stood up and turned around , and Miss Garber started clapping even faster , as if she were standing in the presence of a bona fide movie star . Now Jamie Sullivan was a nice girl . She really was . Beaufort was small enough that it had only one elementary school , so we 'd been in the same classes our entire lives , and I 'd be lying if I said I never talked to her . Once , in second grade , she 'd sat in the seat right next to me for the whole year , and we 'd even had a few conversations , but it did n't mean that I spent a lot of time hanging out with her in my spare time , even back then . Who I saw in school was one thing ; who I saw after school was something completely different , and Jamie had never been on my social calendar . It 's not that Jamie was unattractivedo n't get me wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd taken after her mother , who , based on the pictures I 'd seen , was n't half-bad , especially considering who she ended up marrying . But Jamie was n't exactly what I considered attractive , either . Despite the fact that she was thin , with honey blond hair and soft blue eyes , most of the time she looked sort of . . . plain , and that was when you noticed her at all . Jamie did n't care much about outward appearances , because she was always looking for things like " inner beauty , " and I suppose that 's part of the reason she looked the way she did . For as long as I 'd known herand this was going way back , remembershe 'd always worn her hair in a tight bun , almost like a spinster , without a stitch of makeup on her face . Coupled with her usual brown cardigan and plaid skirt , she always looked as though she were on her way to interview for a job at the library . We used to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow out of it , but she never had . Even through our first three years of high school , she had n't changed at all . The only thing that had changed was the size of her clothes . But it was n't just the way Jamie looked that made her different ; it was also the way she acted . Jamie did n't spend any time hanging out at Cecil 's Diner or going to slumber parties with other girls , and I knew for a fact that she 'd never had a boyfriend her entire life . Old Hegbert would probably have had a heart attack if she had . But even if by some odd turn of events Hegbert had allowed it , it still would n't have mattered . Jamie carried her Bible wherever she went , and if her looks and Hegbert did n't keep the boys away , the Bible sure as heck did . Now , I liked the Bible as much as the next teenage boy , but Jamie seemed to enjoy it in a way that was completely foreign to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every August , but she would read the Bible during lunch break at school . In my mind that just was n't normal , even if she was the minister 's daughter . No matter how you sliced it , reading Paul 's letters to the Ephesians was n't nearly as much fun as flirting , if you know what I mean . But Jamie did n't stop there . Because of all her Bible reading , or maybe because of Hegbert 's influence , Jamie believed it was important to help others , and helping others is exactly what she did . I knew she volunteered at the orphanage in Morehead City , but for her that simply was n't enough . She was always in charge of one fund-raiser or another , helping everyone from the Boy Scouts to the Indian Princesses , and I know that when she was fourteen , she spent part of her summer painting the outside of an elderly neighbor 's house . Jamie was the kind of girl who would pull weeds in someone 's garden without being asked or stop traffic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her allowance to buy a new basketball for the orphans , or she 'd turn around and drop the money into the church basket on Sunday . She was , in other words , the kind of girl who made the rest of us look bad , and whenever she glanced my way , I could n't help but feel guilty , even though I had n't done anything wrong . Nor did Jamie limit her good deeds to people . If she ever came across a wounded animal , for instance , she 'd try to help it , too . Opossums , squirrels , dogs , cats , frogs . . . it did n't matter to her . Dr. Rawlings , the vet , knew her by sight , and he 'd shake his head whenever he saw her walking up to the door carrying a cardboard box with yet another critter inside . He 'd take off his eyeglasses and wipe them with his handkerchief while Jamie explained how she 'd found the poor creature and what had happened to it . " He was hit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Lord 's plan to have me find him and try to save him . You 'll help me , wo n't you ? " With Jamie , everything was in the Lord 's plan . That was another thing . She always mentioned the Lord 's plan whenever you talked to her , no matter what the subject . The baseball game 's rained out ? Must be the Lord 's plan to prevent something worse from happening . A surprise trigonometry quiz that everyone in class fails ? Must be in the Lord 's plan to give us challenges . Anyway , you get the picture . Then , of course , there was the whole Hegbert situation , and this did n't help her at all . Being the minister 's daughter could n't have been easy , but she made it seem as if it were the most natural thing in the world and that she was lucky to have been blessed in that way . That 's how she used to say it , too . " I 've been so blessed to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all we could do was shake our heads and wonder what planet she actually came from . Despite all these other strikes , though , the one thing that really drove me crazy about her was the fact that she was always so damn cheerful , no matter what was happening around her . I swear , that girl never said a bad thing about anything or anyone , even to those of us who were n't that nice to her . She would hum to herself as she walked down the street , she would wave to strangers driving by in their cars . Sometimes ladies would come running out of their house if they saw her walking by , offering her pumpkin bread if they 'd been baking all day or lemonade if the sun was high in the sky . It seemed as if every adult in town adored her . " She 's such a nice young lady , " they 'd say whenever Jamie 's name came up . " The world would be a better place if there were more people like her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . In our minds , one Jamie Sullivan was plenty . I was thinking about all this while Jamie stood in front of us on the first day of drama class , and I admit that I was n't much interested in seeing her . But strangely , when Jamie turned to face us , I kind of got a shock , like I was sitting on a loose wire or something . She wore a plaid skirt with a white blouse under the same brown cardigan sweater I 'd seen a million times , but there were two new bumps on her chest that the sweater could n't hide that I swore had n't been there just three months earlier . She 'd never worn makeup and she still did n't , but she had a tan , probably from Bible school , and for the first time she lookedwell , almost pretty . Of course , I dismissed that thought right away , but as she looked around the room , she stopped and smiled right at me , obviously glad to see that I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would learn the reason why .
