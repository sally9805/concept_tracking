When U.S. steelmakers raise the bogeyman of unfair foreign competition , one firm they have in mind is POSCO of South Korea , which last year passed Japan 's Nippon Steel to become the world 's top producer . Churning out 27.8 million tons of steel products , POSCO earned $620 million , with exports accounting for 25% of revenues . But does it owe its competitive edge to government handouts ? Its ties to Seoul are certainly cozy , and its exports still face countervailing duties abroad , to offset subsidies it received years ago . But analysts say POSCO now operates independently and succeeds through smart management and planning . <P> A visit to the firm 's Kwangyang operation shows why it 's a global leader . Completed in 1992 , the plant is laid out like a big assembly line , with barges transporting raw materials like iron ore in one end and finished steel out the other end . Capacity in the blast furnaces matches capacity in rolling mills down the line , yielding efficiencies . The plant is highly computerized , workers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . <P> In the brewing trade war , POSCO 's exports to the U.S. could shrivel . Yet in the twisted calculus of steel politics , the company lobbying hardest for tariffs , USX-U.S . Steel , also has a stake in cheap POSCO imports . USS-POSCO , a California-based joint venture between the firms , buys most of the Korean steelmaker 's hot-rolled coil imports , which the venture uses to make other products sold in the U.S. A spokesman for U.S. Steel would n't comment on the joint venture 's viability should tariffs be imposed . But , says POSCO 's Lee Chun Hwan , " The venture might not be able to meet its obligations . " <P>  --  D.F . Reported by Donald Macintyre/Seoul
