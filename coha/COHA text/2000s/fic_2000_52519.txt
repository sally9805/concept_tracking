Johanna just wants to fuck baseball players . Baseball . She harbors no lust for the thunder boys of basketball . " Freaks of nature , glandular giants , scary , " she explains . " It 'd be awful , like having sex with a kayak . " Football players do n't arouse her either . " God , no ! Sadistic ogres . They should be out tolling cathedral bells or guarding moats or something . " Nor hockey hunks , soccer stoners , or golfers . <p> Only baseball boys , lanky and sun-browned . " They come in all sizes , " says Johanna . " Big ears , weak chins , strong wrists . Yum . " <p> She sincerely loves them , and I ca n't say why it makes me so angry . Hell , I moan out loud for women athletes , especially those tennis girls on TV , knees bent forward , asses pert and elevated , legs like hardwood . Sometimes I 'll kneel right down in front of the dusty screen and caress their digitized thighs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my butt in tennis , anyhow , even when I call the in things out . <p> Her obsession with baseball players gets me , though . Down deep . It almost curdles my own love of the sport . I mean , yeah , I 've always wanted to be a ballplayer , but I 've never wanted to fuck one . <p> " You sure about that , Ted ? " she asks . <p> " They 'll just disappoint you , " I tell her . " They 're one-dimensional , illiterate , little boys in big pajamas . " <p> The truth of which does n't stop Johanna from walking around at parties , drunk on whiskey sours , proclaiming , " I want Sweet Cal Ripken , Jr. , inside me , " or " I 'm carrying ' Rocket ' Roger Clemens 's lovechild . " She winks . I cringe . <p> " Hummm-baby , " she coos . " Hum it in there , Randy ' Big Unit ' Johnson , the high hard one , " and everyone laughs . Except me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for David Wells , and he 's a member of the All-Ugly Team on my Rotisserie League Web Page . <p> Even worse , Johanna refuses to attend my softball games . <p> " Lame , lame , lame , " she says . " Skim milk . You ca n't bunt or steal . Nobody strikes out . You only play seven innings . It 's whiffle ball for meatheads . " <p> She 's right , too . I mean , I played hardball once . Christ , I was cleanup . Strong arm , clutch hitter , I sprayed the ball all over the field . But that means nothing to her , even when I lie about extra-base hits . I pitch underarm . Real ballplayers throw heat . They rock-and-fire . <p> She goes running after we have sex . I go to sleep . We 're opposite like that . Getting Johanna off just gets her going . " I feel like climbing a glacier , " she says . " I am a succubus , baby , a triathlete of sex . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walkman , rounding failed lawns as the baseball boys round bases , spikes high . <p> 2nd <p> She dumps me for a fat Mormon . One of those phone calls where a voice breaks into your house and whacks you upside the head . <p> " Listen , Teddy , " she says . " This , all of this-us . It 's no good . " <p> " All of this us is no good ? " <p> " Right . When I 'm with you all I feel is awful . " <p> " Do n't sugarcoat it , Johanna . Tell me how you really feel . " Some bad things and some sad things hurt me when I was a kid , then I paved all that over with hard-core athletics , so now , when confronted with trauma , I get as sarcastic as those Armani-suited slick-hairs on SportsCenter . <p> " I do n't want to go into all that feelings stuff , " she says . <p> " Is it Gregory ? " <p> " Yes . Well , no . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with you . " <p> " That 's a relief , " I say . " I would n't want our six months of working this relationship out to complicate any overnight druthers you may be having . " <p> " Teddy , " she says , " this is not about druthers . " See , Johanna 's old-school . She takes things at face value . Sarcasm , to her , is just some forgotten gully on the topographical map of her mind . You know , out near the base of Sarmountain . " You 're not being a good sport , " she says . <p> " Hell , I 'm being a sport and a pastime , " I say . " I mean fuck me for being stupid , but I thought we were , you know , like in love . " <p> " We were never ' like in love , ' Teddy . We were like in-training . " <p> " And so Gregory classifies as cross-training ? " <p> This Mormon chump , Gregory , he used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with him . <p> " Long distance is real tough , " she explained the first time she climbed up me , Halloween night in her hallway . I was Pumpkin-Head , she , Valkyrie , shimmying her spine up the wall , her short strong legs pulling me tight against her . " Close distance is even tougher , " I should have said . I should have said so many things . But instead I drove my tongue deep into her glogg-stained mouth . <p> Gregory does n't live here , but he 's loaded , his parents are Elders or own Safeway or something , so he flies in all the time . Thumbing through Johanna 's diary one time I found his photo . He looks like a mix between Shamu the Killer Whale and Grimace , the McDonald 's milkshake creature . " Greggie , " she calls him . The embellished g 's of his first name skitter across her diary 's pages like an endless horde of blood-fattened ticks . And me , I only merit a few " T  --  " murmurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , " or " T  --  has nice hands , " or " T  --  wakes up petulant . " <p> " No , " she says . " Greggie classifies as love . " <p> 3rd <p> What 's worse is that after she dumps me , she asks me to go dancing . <p> " C'm on , " she says . " It 'll be a hoot . " <p> " What about Greg ? " <p> " Oh , Greggie 's not the boogie type . " <p> " And I am ? " <p> " Well , you know what they say about dancers , do n't you ? " she asks . <p> " They 're candy-asses ? " <p> " If you 're good on the floor , you 're great in the sack . " <p> I grow quiet on the phone . <p> She sing-songs : " Chantal 's coming , too  --  " <p> Chantal is some Urban Archeology babe she had " experimented " with back in college . So I 'm thinking Johanna 's thinking of some kinky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . I slick back my hair , slap on my off-white jeans , and go commando . <p> But sometimes we figure the world wrong . It was n't kink , was n't even a hate fuck . It was a pity invite , like when hunters bless a deer and then blow its head off . All Johanna and Chantal really wanted was a token man to keep the other beasts at bay . Imagine , me , a just-jilted third wheel dancing to Eurofag music with these two hotties going on about who 's lineup is sexier , the Braves or the Dodgers . <p> " Think it through , " says Chantal . " The Braves are always in scoring position . You got that cocky one , Javy Lopez , then Andruw Jones , woof , I 'd like to balk him , then Chipper  --  " <p> " Not bad , but the Dodgers can bat around my order anytime , " counters Johanna . " Sheffield , Karros , Green , Beltre . I get randy every time they take the field  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pound Nyquil . The blue-green goes down smooth , like drinking a good dream . Four a.m. she calls . <p> " You 're being immature , Teddy , " she says . " We were just joshing . . . " I swear I hear Chantal 's laughter in the background . <p> I tell her to eat chalk . She hangs up . <p> I bloody my fists on the walls . It opens certain sinus cavities . I 'm not crying , it 's just my allergies kicking in . <p> A week later Johanna stops by . Tries to console me with some Inner Child bullshit about me needing to get in touch with myself , and I say I touch myself all the time . She shakes her head . <p> " Hey , " I say , but Johanna wo n't look at me . She starts to clean my kitchen . She soaps my sponge , lathers my dishes , sprays Windex on my sugar ants . <p> " Ted , you 're a mess , " she says . <p> " Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greg . In a perfect world you two 'd get along . " <p> " In a perfect world I 'd take your Greggie to the hoop all day long , " I say . " I 'd tie his chunky ass down and force-feed him caffeine or booze or whatever the hell else is taboo in Mormonsvylania . " <p> " Ted , " she says . <p> " In a perfect world your Greg would n't exist , or maybe he 'd exist as a two-toed sloth or some flightless fucking emu or something . " <p> " C'm on , " she says . " Do n't be like  --  " <p> " He would n't exist as your true love , " I say . <p> Johanna pauses . She looks at me gaugingly , as if she was at Whole Foods and was trying to decide what type of sprouts to put on her veggie burger . I step closer . There 's nothing sexier than a woman in Lycra biking shorts scrubbing your silverware . She shakes her head no . Bubbles drip from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs up when I approach , stainless-steel spatula held high . <p> 4th <p> I sit across the street in my car and watch her apartment . It 's duller than the Weather Channel . Lights turn off and on . Sometimes laughter rings out , but mostly I hear his grunts and that lame afro-crap reggae she loves so much . She used to play it when we 'd have sex , and I wonder if she played it then to remind her of him , or if she 's playing it now to remind her of me . Whatever the reason , it still sucks . I take big sips of Cutty Sark , slosh it around in my mouth , saturate my tongue until my cheeks torch numb . <p> When all the lights go out , I sidle up to their window , hoping to hear post-coital confessions or performance apologies , but all I hear are his walrus snores , drowning out her sweet-nocturnal wheezes . They sleep spooned . Potato Boy takes up a lot more room than I ever did , but together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a corner pay phone and call , hoping to hang up on her like every asshole in the world . <p> " Hello ? " she answers . " Is that you , Teddy ? " <p> Her voice is so slight , so worried-like , that , well , fuckall , I feel leaky , wrinkled , like an old birthday balloon . A shrunken reminder of a long-gone day of joy . I disconnect . <p> I suckle my Sark and try again , hoping to arouse him , to get his righteous wrath on the phone , to incite him with blasphemies against the Latter Day Saints , Steve Young can kiss my Agnostic ass ! But he wo n't answer , afraid maybe , or in hibernation . Just not game . <p> 5th <p> Utah beckons with sweet inbred cash , so Greggie leaves for a while . She calls me up , tells me to come over . <p> " We need to talk , " she says . <p> We have sex on her stairs . I bruise my knees , she bites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me afterwards , lacing up her sneakers . She gestures towards a futon . " You can nap there if you need to , " she says . But today I 'm not sleepy . <p> " How about if I run with you ? " I ask . <p> She stares at something in the room I ca n't see . " How about no . " <p> " I 'm no tool . " <p> " Yes . Yes , you are , " she answers . " I 'm not too proud of my need . " <p> " I 'll tell Greggie . " <p> " He knows , " she says . " Sex is n't important to him . He 's not as caught up in Northmanship as you are . " <p> " Northmanship ? " I ask . <p> " Yeah , you know , that machismo Manifest Destiny thing . Striving towards the North Pole , conquering the frigid wasteland , scaling icebergs , mounting everything . " <p> " Jesus , " I say . <p> " Him , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , Ascension , carpentry . It 's all Northmanship . " <p> " What about women ? " <p> " They stay close to the equator . They swim in the sea . " <p> " What about baseball ? What about you and your baseball boys ? " <p> " It 's a maternal sport . You do n't invade territory , do n't stuff a basket , do n't net a puck , do n't stomp in the end zone . " <p> " Fuck , too . It 's paternal as all get out . What about chin music , a high hard one , the warning track , a grand slam , for Christ 's sake ? " <p> " Baseball 's circular . Dugouts are wombs . It 's all about being safe , about returning home . " <p> " What about Fatty ? " <p> " He does n't think of sex as love , and he does n't think of love as competition . His love comes down like  --  warm rain . " <p> " Mormons go in for golden showers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just mean Greg 's a giver , not a taker . He 's selfless . " <p> " Was that selfish ? Or shellfish ? " <p> " Selfless . And do n't call him Fatty . He 's big and comfortable like a bear . " <p> " Oh , and what do you call him ? " I ask . <p> " Fatty , " she says . <p> 6th <p> Turns out he 's married to a nineteen-year-old Mo-Mo gal in Spanish Fork . Johanna , she 's devastated . <p> " We were almost bigamists , " she mutters . <p> " Bigamists and comfortable like a bear , " I smirk . <p> " Long distance is tough , " I continue as she sobs sinking deep into the crevice of my couch . I turn down the TV even though it 's March Madness , and make her some Sleepytime tea . She blubbers into a doze while I massage her feet and watch the muted playoffs . <p> Later , she sits up , with rubber bands and greened pennies cemented to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crevices . I hold her close . We meld . Tears for him chase down her cheek onto my neck . I get goose bumps . <p> 7th <p> To celebrate , I take her to a ballgame . Opening Day , Rangers vs . Orioles . Box seats , blue sky . Big boys chase small balls in short grass , and she cowers in my shoulder nook . I 'm so happy I buy peanuts for the entire A-7 row . <p> We sit in the sun , but Johanna ca n't stop shaking . Even baseball is no elixir for her . She wo n't chart pitches , wo n't blacken in the scorebook diamonds . Wo n't even perk up when Sweet Cal slides headfirst into second and calls time to adjust his jock . <p> She 's okay during game time . She bawls between innings . <p> I rock her back and forth , and she squeaks like a dog toy . Her hands dig at her hands . I try to make good contact . Words come out of me that are n't mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell if I 'm full of crap or finally honest . A lot of the guys would give me a lot of shit for a lot of the things I tell her . She nods vaguely at the statistics . She watches the follies on Ranger-Vision . Players collide , and the ball goes rolling , unmolested . Such errors bring tears to her eyes . Even the boys in the bullpen upset her . <p> " Seems like they throw and throw but never get to play , " she says , chin trembling . <p> " They got ta stay warm , " I say . " They 're getting paid to play catch . Not a bad life . " <p> " You 'd like that . " <p> " Yeah , " I say . " I guess I would . " <p> " You , " she says . " What do you know ? " <p> I know the wonderful wooden thwack of batted balls . I know good defense beats good offense . I know certain distances ca n't be closed . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell her : <p> " Baby , I know you . I know I can give you so much . " <p> " Do we always wrong the people we love ? " she asks , loudly . " Or do we just love the wrong people ? " Sounds like back copy on some self-help book to me . I shrug . I pop my bubble gum like a big leaguer . <p> " Do we ? " she shouts , her face babying up . People turn towards us . Eyes swing and lock . I imagine the fluid pan of TV cameras , lenses closing in on us , broadcasting us to the sport-hungry heartland . <p> " I know I love you , " I say , waiting for the spontaneous surge of applause , the foot-thunder grandstand stomp , the collective cry of " Rally , rally , rally , root , root , root ! " <p> She smiles at me with sweet disgust as if smiling at a kid with a dirty face . I take it as encouragement . I keep talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but something ignites in her eyes . <p> " What ? ! " she demands . <p> She shakes loose from me , scattering plastic cups emblazoned with smiling superstars . <p> " You love me , " I repeat . <p> " That 's as far North as it gets . " <p> " You know you love me . " <p> " Like hell , " she says . " Like hell I do . " <p> " Like hell you do n't , " I answer . <p> Like hell she does n't . <p> The crowd roars . Line drive third-base side , and a foul ball streaks toward us . Ripken sprints over , sky-raised glove shading angel eyes . <p> " Mine , " he shouts . " Mine ! Mine ! " <p> No . Mine . I rise to catch it , jockeying with my fellow A-7 ex-jocks . This is the closest I 'll ever get to making the big grab . I do my best Rodman , and elbow out myself a space in the grandstands . I rise up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hands surges around me . Ripken 's mitt , like some monster 's elephantine paw , penetrates the sea of outstretched fingers and bumps against my wrist . But I reach higher . I snag the glorious foul . <p> High fives , back slaps , wide grins . Every single fan claps as I hold the horsehide up high , my arm locked in exaltation . Fucking-A ! I 'm thinking . Fucking-A right ! Palm stinging , I turn to hand my girl my trophy . <p> But too late . She 's gone . Beautiful Johanna disappears down the exit ramp , South Section A. <p> I look back at the field . Ripken jogs back to third base , crouches nonchalant into position . That fucker . To him it 's just another check swing . Just one more foul ball . I grip the ball by its blood-red seams . <p> " Hey , buddy , " I shout . " Hey , Mr. Ironman . " Ripken turns , squinting into our Lone Star seats . <p> Crow hop and I rocket the pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A perfect strike . Frozen rope . Sweet Cal barely gets his glove up in time , snow cone to save face . He gives me a thumbs-up , then whips the ball around the horn . <p> They should sign me up . <p> <p> By Alex Smith <p>
