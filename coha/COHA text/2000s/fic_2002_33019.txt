Migration I was shipped off to India that summer because of the death of a deer . There were deer crossing signs all along the Cross-Westchester Expressway , but this one came out of nowhere . The car was totaled , and when the police came they told us not to feel bad about the deer , it was an aged old thing , and it had died quickly . They helped us get the car off the highway and called our parents , and waited with us for a towtruck . Then they arrested Steve for driving under the influence . Steve had only had a few beers at his brother 's house earlier that evening ; I 'd had only half of one beer because they 'd just put the six-packs in the refrigerator and they were still too warm for my taste . So I had n't been the one drinking , and I was n't the one who killed the deer . I had n't really done anything wrong but I was the one being sent away for the summer . My mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confirming why she should n't like Steve , and why I should be separated from what she called , in a piercing voice in the car on the way home from the police station , my " frat-boy boyfriend . " Steve was n't in a fraternity , he was still in high school , and he would never join a fraternity when he went to college . I would n't have liked Steve if he drank a lot at parties , or at football games , or if he drank because he was happy and having fun . Steve drank because he was sad , and I understood that . Sadness had a home in me , too . Dust whited out the view as the plane 's wheels skidded beyond the undersize tarmac runway into dirt . When my windowcleared , I could see men running straight for us pushing rickety staircases on rollers like they were moving props for a play . There was no control tower , just a short , squat terminal building next to the airfield . I had a lot of hand luggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appliances that would have been stolen if I had put them in my suitcases : a CD Walkman , a battery-operated egg beater , components for my uncle 's satellite dish , high-power camera lenses . And two cartons of Camels I had bought , at my father 's instruction , in the duty-free shop in Frankfurt during the layover yesterday morning . I had never bought cigarettes legally before . I had felt conspicuous standing in front of the cashier , but , unblinking , she took my dollars and gave me a handful of Deutschemarks as change . I gathered together my packages , hoping that my uncle might board the plane to help me carry everything . Last time we had come to India , three years ago , he and my aunt came right onto the aircraft , along with my father 's old classmate who ran the airport . I waited until most of the people had filed past me off the plane , but my uncle was nowhere to be seen . I pretended to be younger , and confused about airports , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the terminal . He was short but muscular , and , like everyone else on the government-owned airline , wore a black armband to mourn the former prime minister 's death . The heat hovered over the ground in those shimmery waves I 'd seen on car commercials . As we walked closer to the terminal , hundreds of people were hanging over the two balconies , one on the second floor and one on the roof , yelling names and greetings . Only villagers who had never seen a plane land before were willing to stand out there in the sun . Since my uncle would not be there , I did n't even bother to look up . The steward deposited me in the line for passport control for noncitizens , and then he scooted off in the direction of the very short lines for citizens . I half pulled , half kicked my bags forward through the slow-moving line , until I faced a passport officer across a grubby glass divider . The officer asked me something I could n't understand . It must have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Malayalam , " How long a stay ? " The airport was in the state of Tamil Nadu , but it was on the border of Kerala , so as many Malayalam speakers traveled through it as Tamil speakers . " Three months , " I answered in English . I could understand Malayalam but I was n't comfortable speaking it . He looked at my passport picture and then at me , at my picture again , and then at me . " I wear contacts now , " I explained , pointing to the big glasses on the little face in the photo . He asked , " Where are your parents ? " " They 're not here , I came by myself . " He said , " You are fifteen and they sent you by yourself ? " He seemed to think my parents had shown poor judgment . " In America , I always get around by myself , " I said . He shook his head , stamped my passport , and let me through . My last resort to avoid this India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him how I wanted to get a summer job , in a dentist 's office or at the mall , and see my friends , and swim a lot . I told him half of what I earned I would save for college and we could even try a curfew again . I could almost see my father and me being friends when my mother was out of town on her frequent business trips . She worked for a commercial real-estate firm , and she spent a lot of time in Canada coaxing companies to come down here and build office parks . When she was away , my dad , who ran his own leather goods company , played single parent . I would try to get him to come around to my views on Mother , and he 'd listen quietly as I described how she had embarrassed me at the PTA meeting or how she had forgotten to pick me up from swim practice . But then she would come back from her business trip . He would light up when he heard the airport limo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her with her luggage , forgetting to wear his coat , or even shoes one time . So I did n't ask him right away to try to renegotiate this India trip , but waited until the summer got closer . And he actually took my side , he actually said , " I do n't think this is the right way to handle Maya " this was not said in front of me , but I overheard it like I overheard many things , by hanging around doorways and corners . This was followed by days of tense and terse dinnertable conversations , and seeing my mother carrying pillows and blankets to her home office . It made me a little nervousit was one thing wanting my father unglued from her but I did n't want them having problems over me . My father broached it one last time with her while they were weeding the garden , which resulted in another night of pillows and blankets being carried up and down stairs , closet doors slamming . My mother thought spending time with her relatives might teach me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought where we had come from was n't as important as dealing with where we were now . He explained this to me with his shoulders hunched in defeat . Seeing him like that , I started to feel like going to India might be better than staying around to watch everything crumble .
