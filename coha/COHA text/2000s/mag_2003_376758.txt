Down a dirt road , tucked in rolling fields , John Nutting 's farm is a picture of tranquillity . A wintry breeze sighs through the forest . Black-and-white Holsteins chew their cuds in a lazy rhythm . Only the large sign hammered onto a red barn attests to the defiant mood in Maine dairy country : OUR PLEDGE  --  NO ARTIFICIAL HORMONES . <P> Hormones are a hot issue in these parts . As do at least 85% of Maine 's milk producers , Nutting signs an affidavit each year vowing not to inject his cows with recombinant bovine somatotropin ( RBST ) , a genetically engineered growth hormone . " We 're proud of the way we farm , " says the third-generation dairyman . " Consumers have the right to know how their milk is made . " <P> Not necessarily . A food fight has erupted in New England between those who would label their produce as they see fit and those who argue that some of those labels give customers a false impression . Chief among the latter is Monsanto Corp. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action to quell consumer resistance to its product . <P> The St. Louis , Mo. , multinational demanded last year that Maine suspend its official Quality seal , which is granted only to milk from uninjected cows . When the state refused , Monsanto took another tack , suing one of Maine 's leading dairies in federal court in Boston . The suit charged that Oakhurst Dairy , the company that buys Nutting 's milk , is misleading consumers by advertising a no-artificial-hormone pledge , implying that its milk is safer and healthier . " Milk is milk , " says Janice Armstrong , Monsanto 's director of public affairs . <P> That sets the stage for the latest chapter in a battle that has raged for more than a decade . Critics claim  --  although studies are inconclusive  --  that using synthetic bovine growth hormone could lead to such health problems as premature puberty or even cancer . But the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) studied the issue before it approved RBST in 1993 , when it reported that tests showed no significant difference between the milk from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consumers Union and the Center for Food Safety , say the tests did in fact reveal worrisome differences and that the FDA incorrectly interpreted the data . Activists campaigning against genetically modified ( GM ) food want the U.S. to ban RBST outright , as Europe and Canada have . As for Maine , " we would rather be safe than sorry , " says assistant attorney general Francis Ackerman , who is preparing the state 's brief to intervene on Oakhurst 's behalf .
