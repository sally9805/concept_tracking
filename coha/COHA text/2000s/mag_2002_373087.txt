One of the best ways to make money and reduce risk in today 's choppy market is through a classic hedge fund : one that bets on some stocks to go up and others to go down . Since January 2000 , when the Dow peaked , hedge funds have risen 13% on average , while the typical stock has fallen 20% , reports Hennessee Group , a hedge-fund tracker . Over the past three years , assets in the 6,000 U.S. hedge funds have more than doubled , to $563 billion . <P> Most of that money has flowed in from the very wealthy , who can pony up the $1 million minimum investment required by the typical hedge fund . But Wall Street is making hedge funds and similar investments more accessible to the merely well-off . That 's a welcome development , but it 's one that requires some caution about fees , returns and types of funds . Hedge funds come in many varieties and are by no means a sure thing  --  especially those that use a lot of leverage and make big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Management a few years ago . Even George Soros has had trouble from time to time . Focus on ones that seek to hedge against market risk . They usually trounce the market when times get tough . Here 's how to play : <P> HEDGE FUNDS . These investment vehicles are lightly regulated but can accept only 99 " accredited " investors who have at least $1 million in net worth , excluding home equity . A typical hedge fund charges an annual fee of 1% of assets invested , plus 20% of profits . More hedge funds are opening to those with " just " $100,000 to $250,000 to invest , but these are mainly new funds or those with lackluster performance . One strong exception is JLH Capital Investment , a " market-neutral " fund that requires a minimum stake of $250,000 . A similar fund is Gryphon Partners , with a $200,000 minimum . <P> FUNDS OF HEDGE FUNDS . These vehicles reduce risk by owning slices of many kinds of hedge funds , from those focused on classic long-short strategies to ones that specialize in arbitrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( sec ) are run much like straight hedge funds . Many have dropped their minimums to $250,000 or less . In this class , Aurora , P &A; Diversified and Stellar Partners have each risen more than 50% over the past three years . One advantage with funds of funds is that they have access to the best managers , who charge high minimums . The big drawback is that you pay two layers of fees : one to the fund-of-funds manager , who in turn gets charged by each fund in the portfolio . <P> The latest wrinkle is funds of funds that are registered with the SEC . These are subject to stricter reporting and disclosure requirements and must have a board that looks out for shareholder interests . Investors must still meet the net-worth test , but the number of investors is unlimited . Minimums run as low as $25,000 . The biggest player is UBS PaineWebber , which manages $3 billion like this . Similar funds are sold at banks and other firms . In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 5%.
