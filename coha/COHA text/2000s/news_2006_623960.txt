<p> In a sport of huge men behaving violently , there 's a game within the game , a very subtle one . <p> A shift in weight onto a guard 's hands , pressing the blood from his knuckles , might mean something . So might a glance by an offensive tackle toward a defensive end , rather than straight ahead at a linebacker . If a tailback lines up a half-yard deeper than normal , that might mean something too . <p> To listen to many NFL defensive players , past and present , offensive players often give inadvertent tip-offs when they 're setting up before the snap . <p> Linemen will tip off what 's coming by whether their weight is forward ( run ) or back ( pass ) . A tackle 's quick glance at a defensive end , rather than at the linebacker lined up over him , might mean he 's going to block down on the end . A wide receiver will indicate by his body language that he 's expecting the ball to come his way . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a big block to make , " Raiders middle linebacker Danny Clark said . " That 's something you learn in Pop Warner : to read the back 's eyes ( before the snap ) . " <p> From Pop Warner to high school to college to the pros , defensive coaches and players scrutinize game films to discover not only opponents ' tendencies but the subtle movements that might give away plays . <p> Frequently , they find them . <p> Teams tip off plays " all the time , " said 49ers assistant head coach Mike Singletary , a Hall of Fame linebacker for the Chicago Bears . " The better the team , the less they do it . " <p> Sometimes it does n't do the defense any good . A play might be so well executed that a split-second head start by a linebacker toward the point of attack is still too late . <p> And some players are so great that even when the defense knows what 's going to happen , it does n't matter . <p> As Sam Huff , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 70s , told The Chronicle , " Jim Brown did n't care if you knew he was coming . " <p> Several players interviewed about what they look for play for the local NFL teams . So it needs to be pointed out that there 's a big difference between occasionally detecting tipped-off plays and defending consistently well , as the defensive rankings of the Raiders ( 27th ) and 49ers ( 32nd ) this season would suggest . <p> On the other hand , examples of tipped-off plays occur at the highest level of the game : <p>  --  Super Bowl XVI , Jan. 24 , 1982  --  The Cincinnati Bengals , trailing 20-7 , had a third down at the 49ers ' 1-yard line late in the third quarter . Dan Bunz , an inside linebacker for the 49ers , was watching running back Charles Alexander . <p> " When he got down in his stance , instead of looking straight ahead , he turned a little toward the tight end , looking in the direction he was going , " Bunz said the other day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighter , and his knuckles are white . " <p> That glance and his stance indicated Alexander was going out for a swing pass . <p> " I deepened a step and widened more to the outside , " Bunz said . " He 's quick and he 's my guy . " <p> Moving before the snap allowed Bunz to avoid the tight end . He grabbed Alexander as soon as he caught the pass , saving a touchdown . <p> On fourth down , Bunz said , the split between the guard and tackle was bigger . Alexander was the halfback , and , Bunz said , " Everything told me he was coming to block whoever was in the hole . " <p> That meant powerful fullback Pete Johnson would have the ball right behind him . Bunz screamed , " Lead ! Lead ! " at Jack " Hacksaw " Reynolds , the other inside linebacker . <p> Bunz met Alexander at the gap . " He hit me so hard , my chinstrap broke , and my helmet hit me in the nose , " Bunz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But Reynolds , along with nose tackle Archie Reese and tackle Lawrence Pillers , penetrated the line of scrimmage and stuffed Johnson before he could leap over the pile . A long Cincinnati drive had come up empty . <p> Final score : 49ers 26 , Bengals 21 . <p>  --  Super Bowl XX , Jan. 26 , 1986  --  Singletary , the middle linebacker and inspirational leader of Chicago 's overpowering " 46 " defense , said he could read the New England offense like a book with large type , partly because  --  to his amazement  --  the Patriots used the same plays and calls they had used in a loss to the Bears earlier that year . <p> " I 'd say they tipped off the plays 80 percent of the time , " Singletary said recently . Quarterback Tony Eason was doing most of the tipping , he said . " When he 'd come to the line of scrimmage , if it was a pass , his eyes were really wide . He knew we were coming ( on a blitz ) . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Running back ) Craig James is coming right here ! You do n't call it out right away . You 'd wait until ( Eason ) did n't have time to get out of it ( with an audible ) . He 'd give you a look , like , ' Wow , how did you know that ? ' " <p> And how did Singletary know it ? " Film , " he said . " If you look hard enough and long enough , there 's always something , even on really good teams . " <p> Final score : Bears 46 , Patriots 10 . <p>  --  Super Bowl XXIX , Jan. 29 , 1995  --  A rookie guard for the Chargers , Isaac Davis , " was giving a lot away , " said Gary Plummer , then an inside linebacker for the 49ers . " It was like stealing candy from a baby . " <p> One of San Diego 's favorite plays was called a " spot " route , in which wide receiver Mark Seay would run between the linebackers and either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense reacted . But when Seay came inside , Plummer would deck him before quarterback Stan Humphries could pass the ball . <p> " Offensive players do n't understand that these tendencies are so easy to see , " said Plummer , the analyst on 49ers radio broadcasts . <p> Once the 49ers had taken away the bread-and-butter pass play and limited the Chargers ' use of rushing star Natrone Means by taking a big lead , Plummer said , " they had nothing left . " <p> Final score : 49ers 49 , Chargers 26 . <p> It 's possible to concentrate too much on what individual players are doing before the snap , said former Raiders linebacker Greg Biekert . <p> " If you focus on tips , you forget the big picture , " he said . " As a linebacker , you need to be watching their 11 guys and concentrating on what your reads are and what our defensive call is . You can get into an overload situation . You see that with younger guys  --  too much overload . They 're thinking too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can greatly aid a defense . And when it comes to tipping off plays , the Raiders ' Clark said , " linemen are the main culprits . They 're known for tipping off which way a play is going . There 's a saying among defensive players that offensive linemen do n't lie . " <p> If it 's a pass or a draw play , " they 're light on their hands . A lot of linemen usually lean when they 're going to pull . You can tell a pulling guard all day long . " <p> In general , former Raiders defensive back George Atkinson said , " Guards tell more than tackles because they 've got to make their moves more quickly . " <p> Raiders defensive end Ed Jasper said a pulling lineman is apt to set up a half a foot back of his normal position , " especially for a guy who has trouble getting out of his stance for a pull . Mostly that 's only the younger guys . As guys get older in the league , they make everything look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' center , pointed out a trend that has helped the offense . " One thing that defensive linemen have always looked for in the past is , if they can see the whites of our fingertips , a lot of times that 's a dead giveaway for a run . Most offensive linemen wear gloves now , so it 's harder for defensive linemen to tell . " <p> There 's another reason to look at a lineman 's hands . " Sometimes the up hand would be clinched or he might have a nervous twitch if that was the point of attack , " former 49ers defensive coordinator Bill McPherson said . <p> Trying to set up the same way every time and stay that way until the snap is n't as easy as it sounds . As Clark says , " Those big guys have a lot of stuff to move . " It 's tempting for players who weigh more than 300 pounds to cheat slightly as they set up . The wary eye will spot it . <p> " As the game goes on , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them start out great . In the first quarter everybody 's crisp . In the third quarter , going into the fourth quarter , they get tired and begin to get lazy . Rather than getting all the way down in the stance , they stand up a little bit , so they 're not run-blocking . " <p> Plummer says 49ers defensive end Marques Douglas sometimes is so sure of a play being tipped off that he 'll turn to the linebackers and secondary and actually mimic the motion of passing the ball . " I worry that some day the snap will come while he 's doing that , " Plummer said . " I know I would be insulted as a linebacker if one of my linemen was recognizing it before me . " <p> For a running back , the tip-off is n't in his hands but his eyes and where he lines up . " If a running back is getting the ball , he may look straight ahead , " 49ers linebacker Julian Peterson said , " but if he has to pass-block , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> With San Diego star LaDainian Tomlinson , Raiders defensive end Bobby Hamilton said , " You ca n't tell because he 's got the ( face ) shield on . " <p> Some running backs will look around on running plays  --  and still give something away . " It happens even with older guys , " Plummer said . " Emmitt Smith ( of the Cowboys ) thought he was scanning left and right , but he would focus on one area ( where he was headed ) . If he was n't , his fullback , Daryl Johnson , was doing it . As a linebacker , you 're checking those things out . " <p> " Younger running backs who are n't as confident in their blocking ability will line up closer to the quarterback if it 's a pass play , " Raiders free safety Stuart Schweigert said . " If it 's a running play , they 'll line up fairly deep . " <p> Added Clark , " A lot of backs put their hands on their thigh pad when they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to run . " <p> The Jets ' Curtis Martin successfully avoided an obvious tip-off against Tampa Bay in 2000 . The play was an option pass by the halfback , but Martin needed to take his glove off to make the throw ; otherwise he could n't grip the ball properly . He discreetly took the glove off in the huddle and dropped it on the field when the ball was snapped . His pass to Wayne Chrebet worked for a game-winning touchdown . <p> Some of the game 's greatest receivers tipped off plays , according to Atkinson . <p> Like the Jets ' Don Maynard  --  " When he was running a route , he 'd always look back at the quarterback just before the snap . For a running play , he would n't look at the quarterback . I always knew when it was a run or a pass with the Jets . " <p> Or the Chargers ' Lance Alworth  --  " When he was running a route , he 'd be closer ( to the line of scrimmage ) by about half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me quickly . " <p> Or Bengals tight end Bob Trumpy  --  " When he was blocking , he 'd be in tighter to the tackle . " <p> Some wideouts just " look more interested " on pass plays , Singletary said . On running plays , " they 're not working to get off the block or the jam . Body language says a lot . " <p> It has been said that Terrell Owens will wriggle his fingers or adjust his gloves before the snap if a pass is supposed to come his way . Schweigert said he was n't sure of that , but said , " If he was slow off the ball , it was a running play , or it was not going his way . We saw it on film before we played ( the Eagles ) this year . " <p> That information did n't stop T.O . from making nine catches for 80 yards and a touchdown in a 23-20 Philadelphia win over the Raiders . <p> Players and ex-players said it was usually difficult to detect tip-offs in most quarterbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernie Kosar would have his feet staggered at the snap for a pass play but squared for a run . <p> Even Hall of Famer Dan Fouts did the same thing , according to Atkinson . " Jack Tatum and I picked it up the first time we played them . " <p> Reached at his home in Oregon , Fouts said , " There 's some validity to that . But when you 're throwing 70 percent of the time , if they 're looking at my feet , they 're going to get beat . " <p> He said he experimented with the staggered-feet stance early in his career . " Once I realized ( opponents ) were looking at that , I 'd mix things up , " he said . " Randy Gradishar ( the Denver middle linebacker ) would holler , ' Blue ! ' ( for a pass ) . Then I 'd change my feet , and he 'd yell , ' Red ! ' ( for a run ) . Then I 'd change them back , and he 'd yell , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the defenders who are tipping off the plays , Fouts said . " One way is that a linebacker 's eyeballs would bulge out of his helmet if he was going to blitz . <p> " There 's a reason those guys play defense , " he said with a laugh , " and it 's not because they 're rocket scientists . " <p> Hint , hint <p>  --  The clue : Offensive linemen have their weight back , off their hands , before snap . <p> What it may mean : Pass or draw play . <p>  --  The clue : As a running back gets in position , he scans line but pays particular attention to one spot . <p> What it may mean : That 's the point of attack . <p>  --  The clue : Guard sets up slightly deeper , or has his weight back while other linemen are forward , or is leaning slightly in one direction . <p> What it may mean : He 's pulling . <p>  --  The clue : Wide receiver adjusts his gloves as he breaks huddle or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the primary receiver . <p>  --  The clue : Quarterback has his weight back as he calls signals . <p> What it may mean : He 's preparing to drop back to pass .
