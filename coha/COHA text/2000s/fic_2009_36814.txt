Logan got the call while he was making an arrest . <p> The vampire he cuffed in a West Hollywood club had been running a slavery ring of " blood donors , " people who fed a vampire a little at a time without being drained . <p> " Septimus will hear about this , " the vampire hissed . <p> Logan locked magically charged cuffs around the vamp 's wrists . " Septimus gave me his blessing . You 're embarrassing him . " <p> The vampire paled as much as a vampire could pale , and Logan 's cell phone chirped . Logan passed the vamp to his partner , Tony Nez , and snapped open the phone . <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " Logan . " A female voice went breathless with relief . <p> " Nadia ? " Everything stopped . <p> He 'd seen the demon woman Nadia twice since he 'd interviewed her six months ago in her hospital bed . She 'd been through so much , and still her smile was sensual , her dark eyes defiant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time with her . Dangerously so . <p> Her pleading tone nearly broke the self-control he 'd been battling for the last six months . " What 's wrong ? " <p> " I do n't know where I am . There 's lots of woods , and they 're coming . " <p> " Slow down , slow down . Who 's coming ? " <p> " Hell . " She broke off , the one word filled with terror . " Logan , please . " The phone clicked off . <p> " Nadia ? " <p> Logan glared at the unfamiliar phone number that slid neatly to the top of his recent calls list . <p> " Shit . " His wolf was growling and snarling , his hand gripping the phone so hard the plastic began to crack . <p> " Trouble ? " Tony asked , giving the vampire over to uniformed cops who marched him outside . It was nearly dawn , and the vampire screamed at them to hurry and put him in the van . <p> " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new computer system that had been installed in all the paranormal detectives ' vehicles . In theory they used it to quickly find priors and other information on suspects , but it came in handy for other things as well . All searches for the phone number Nadia had called from turned up blank . <p> Seething , Logan called a uniformed sergeant at the station to trace the number . Experienced sergeants trumped computer searches every time . Just as he 'd finished , his cell rang again , same number . <p> " Nadia ? " he bellowed into it . <p> " She ran away , " a male voice said . He sounded wrong , keyed up , filled with adrenaline and excitement . " More fun that way . " Click . <p> Tony got in the driver 's seat and started the car . " Where to , boss ? " <p> " Station , " Logan said , staring at his phone . <p> " Bad news ? " <p> " What ? " He snapped his attention to Tony . Logan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Tony never minded talking about his large and boisterous extended family back home in the Navajo Nation . <p> " The phone calls , " Tony said in a patient voice . " You look like I did the first time I saw a ghost . " <p> " A woman I know . " Logan tucked the phone into his pocket , his heart drumming . He quickly told Tony what had happened , and his partner blenched . <p> " Best we find out where she is , then . " Tony put his foot down , turned on the siren , and zipped through LA freeways toward the paranormal division headquarters . <p> What Logan did n't tell Tony was that the second caller had been a werewolf . The man 's voice had grated with excitement , which meant he was keyed up enough to lose control of the change . <p> And worse , Logan knew who it was-the man who had cost him everything , and forced Logan to lonely exile on the streets of Los Angeles . <p> Chapter Two By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Parker Center in downtown LA , Logan 's uniformed sergeant had traced the phone number . <p> " It 's a pay phone at a gas station in a place called Brookside . That 's a wide spot in the road on the California-Oregon border , according to the gas station owner . He said he never noticed anyone using the phone . " <p> A demon , even one pursued through the woods at the crack of dawn , was stealthy enough to use a pay phone without anyone seeing . <p> Logan nodded tersely , thanked the man for his help , and went to his lieutenant , McKay , a small , black half-Sidhe woman , to ask for a leave of absence . <p> Tony wanted to go with him . <p> " It 's way out of our jurisdiction , " Logan said , grabbing a duffel bag out of his locker . <p> " So why are you going ? " <p> " Nadia 's a friend . I 'm making this personal . " <p> " All the more reason you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the garage and slung bottles of water and extra ammunition into the duffel bag . He thought of the triumph in the man 's voice on the phone and knew he would be dealing with whatever this was as a werewolf , not a cop . <p> " You have a family to support . I do n't want them pissed off at me for getting you hurt ... " <p> " You worried because it 's a werewolf thing ? I 'm a shaman . I grew up dealing with Four Corners werewolves , and do n't think that was n't a picnic . " <p> " If it were a Navajo thing , I 'm not sure you 'd welcome my help , " Logan said . <p> Tony grinned . " Hey , next time I have to face my grandmother , I 'd love to have you as backup . Tell you what-you run into trouble up there , you call me . I can get there fast . Deal ? " <p> " Deal . " Logan finished strapping down his duffel , slid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of other help he could ask for , the most formidable being Tain , his ex-partner 's Immortal boyfriend . But he wanted to figure things out before he called for backup . <p> The bad blood between Logan and this werewolf ran deep , and anyone who got involved could die . Logan had thought that when he left the pack in Minnesota , everything was finished . He realized now that the problem had only festered . It was time to end it-no matter what it took . <p> Ten hours later , Logan pulled into the gas station in the tiny town of Brookside , a stop on the way up to Klamath Falls . The morning attendant at the convenience store had gone , but his replacement knew that the police had called asking about someone using their phone . <p> " If I 'd been here , I 'd have seen her , " the kid said . He had greasy hair , an acne-scarred face , and a rawboned body . " I see everyone and everything around here . " <p> " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had no photo of Nadia , but he described her as he remembered her-five foot six , short curly dark hair , coffee-brown eyes , slim athletic body . <p> The kid shook his head . " Nope . But if I do see her , I 'll let you know . You got somewhere I can reach you ? " <p> Logan left his cell phone number without much hope . She 'd been out of breath , scared , running for her life . She would n't come back here . <p> He thanked the kid and left the convenience store after purchasing a packet of instant coffee and some disposable razors . He stashed the purchases in his saddlebag and approached the two lighted pay phones on the left side of the building . <p> In this day and age , pay phones were relics , usually graffiti-laden and forlorn under their plastic half domes . But there were still dead zones where cell phone signals did n't reach , and land lines had their uses . <p> Logan knew which phone Nadia had used before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He closed his eyes and took in the brimstone smell of demon coupled with a flowery fragrance that was Nadia 's own . That scent was overridden with Nadia 's fear and the heavy musk of werewolf . <p> He 'd been here . Logan could n't tell if he had Nadia or whether she 'd gotten away , but he knew one thing-the Challenge had been made , and Logan would meet it . And this time , he 'd win . <p> Nadia kept running . Her feet ached , her naked body was coated with sweat and dirt , and her breath grated like sand in her lungs . <p> She 'd been running for two days and two nights , sometimes in her demon form , sometimes in her human form . But she knew her trackers would n't let her drop dead of exhaustion , because that would n't be as much fun . If she lay down and died , they could n't do anything to her . <p> She heard them coming , the werewolves running on all fours , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the woods . They 'd enjoyed that she 'd laid false trails and doubled back , enjoyed locating her scent again with howls of triumph . Now they simply wanted to catch her , no more games . <p> Being able to call Logan had been an incredible piece of luck . Nadia had dashed out of the trees and found the convenience store in the middle of a crumbling parking lot , two lit phones turned toward her like friends . <p> She 'd crept to the edge of the trees , then morphed into her human form before cautiously approaching . She was naked , of course , and could only hope that no one would come around the building and spot her . But the parking lot remained deserted , the only sign of life the hum of the ice machines next to the building . <p> Her fingers shook as she keyed in her phone card number , then the number of Logan 's cell . She 'd had to try three times-so many numbers , and she kept missing one and having to start all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd memorized his phone number . The few times they 'd met since he 'd interviewed her in the hospital they 'd kept the conversation neutral on topics of mutual interest : motorcycles , movies , music , TV shows . No reason they should remember each other 's numbers , but she thought of calling him often . Every day , in fact . She 'd never been able to quite forget the werewolf whose tawny eyes had burned with compassion for an injured demon . <p> When Logan 's deep tones had floated into her ear , far too much relief had flooded her . <p> They were coming . Dragging in deep breaths , Nadia scrambled up another hill and turned to run just below the ridgeline . She stumbled more than once , and she knew that soon she 'd fall and be too tired to rise . And then they 'd have her . <p> She drew in the last of her strength and shot forward , just as she heard the howling wolves crest the ridge and come for her . <p> ( Continues ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
