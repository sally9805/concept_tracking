Wolves <br> <br> One of his hands tugged cruelly at her hair as the other squeezed her throat . Miss Temple could not breathe  --  he was too strong , too angry  --  and even as part of her mind screamed that she must not , that there must be another way , she ground the revolver into the man 's body and pulled the trigger . It kicked against her wrist with a deafening crack and Roger Bascombe was thrown into the cabin wall . The red imprint of his fingers marked her windpipe , but his shocked blue eyes  --  the fiance who had cruelly thrown her over  --  showed only dismay at her betrayal . His gaze punctured her heart like a blade . What had she done ? She stumbled , aware for the first time that her feet were freezing , that she stood in six inches of icy seawater . The airship had spiraled into the ocean . They were sinking . She would drown . <br> Dimly , Miss Temple heard her name  --  Celeste !

She must follow , it was her only chance to survive . . . but she looked again at Roger , crumpled and wan , and could not move  --  would they die together after all ? But then something nudged Miss Temple 's leg . She cried out , thinking of rats on a ship , and saw it was another body , floating with the rising water . . . the Comte d'Orkancz , alchemist savant who discovered the blue glass , run through with a saber by Cardinal Chang . Miss Temple forced herself to slog past the dead man 's bulk , barely able to feel her legs . Other bodies loomed as she crossed the cabin , each more gruesome than the last . . . Francis Xonck , with his flaming red hair and elegant silk waistcoat , shot by Doctor Svenson . . . Lydia Vandaariff , decapitated with a blue glass book . . . the Prince of Macklenburg , legs broken clean away . Miss Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her fingers clawed the cold metal . The cries above were fainter . With a piercing shock she remembered the one body she had not seen , the Contessa di Lacquer-Sforza . . . had she jumped to her death ? Had she somehow hidden and killed the others ? Was she even then waiting for Miss Temple ? <br> The cold salt water reached her throat , splashing at her mouth . Her arms became too heavy to lift . Behind lay Roger . . . her terrible guilt . Above floated the open hatch . She could not move for the ice forming around her legs , locking her joints stiff . She would perish after all , just as she deserved . . . <br> Miss Temple woke  --  weak , starving , and riddled with aches  --  to a sour-smelling room with dark raw-cut beams above her head . A single smeared window framed the feeble light of a heavy , cloud-covered sky , the very image of boiled wool . She sat up in the frankly noisome bed , doing her best to shake away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least it does not reek of fish , " she muttered , and looked about her for any sign of where she was or , for that matter , her clothing . But the room was bare . <br> She crept gingerly off the bed , feeling the unsoundness of her limbs and the lightness of her head , and peered under the frame , to find a chipped porcelain chamber pot . As Miss Temple squatted down , she rubbed her eyes , and looked at her hands , which were flecked with half-healed abrasions and cuts . She stood , slid the pot back beneath the bed with her foot , and noticed a small rectangle of glass , no bigger than a page of poetry , hanging from a nail  --  a mirror . She was forced to stand on her toes , but despite the effort , stayed staring into the glass for some minutes , curious and dismayed at the young woman she there met . <br> Her chestnut curls hung flat and lank , which had the effect of making her face  --  from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only set off by her sunken cheeks , the dark circles of distress beneath each eye , and once more a scattering of livid marks  --  the searing trace of a bullet above one ear , welts across both cheekbones , and greenish bruises on her throat that perfectly matched a vicious , squeezing palm . All this Miss Temple took in with a sigh , grateful she had not , for instance , lost a tooth  --  that all could be mended by time , food , and the touch of a skillful maid . What struck her more fully , however  --  what she found mysterious  --  was what had happened to her eyes . They were still grey , still insistent , impatient , and sharp , but possessed a new quality she could not at first name . A moment later the truth appeared . She was a killer . <br> Miss Temple sat back on the bed and stared up at the darkening clouds . She had shot Roger Bascombe and left his body to the sea . Certainly the man had betrayed her , betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become in defeating him , in thwarting the powerful figures Roger had chosen to serve , chosen over her love , their marriage . . . what had she herself cast away ? <br> Such thoughts were impossible on an empty stomach . She would eat , bathe , dress , locate her friends  --  still an oddly foreign notion to Miss Temple  --  and take assurance from their survival , that it had all been necessary . <br> But when she called to the door , her voice an alarmingly ragged croak , there came no answer . Instead of calling again , Miss Temple lay down and pulled the blankets up over her face . <br> As she lay sniffing the dusty wool , she recalled what she could of her coming ashore . They had been on the roof of the dirigible 's cabin , waiting to drown as it dropped into the sea , but instead of sinking they came aground on fortunate rocks , saved . She reached the sand on her hands and knees , half-drowned and cold to the bone , frozen anew by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivering ball . Chang carried her beyond the narrow ribbon of beach and over a hedge of sharp black rocks , but already she felt her body failing , unable to form words for her chattering teeth . There were black trees , the Doctor banging on a wooden door , racks of drying and salted fish , and then she was bundled in front of a burning hearth . Outside it was morning , but inside the hut the air was close and foul , as if it had been nailed tight against the cold all winter . The dirigible 's original destination had been the Duchy of Macklenburg , on the Baltic Sea  --  how far north had the airship flown ? Someone held hot tea for her to drink , then they  --  Eloise ?  --  took off her clothes and wrapped her in blankets . Miss Temple felt her chills swiftly escalate into fever . . . and then dreams had swallowed her whole . <br> Miss Temple sighed heavily , the sound quite muffled beneath the bedding , and slept . <br> When she next awoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Miss Temple crawled from the bed and stood more steadily than before . She plucked at her simple shift , wondering where it had come from , and pushed the hair from her face . How much must have happened while she slept ? Yet instead of forming the many questions she ought to have had  --  about her companions , their location , the very date  --  Miss Temple found her attention drawn to a lurid flickering  --  already  --  beneath the surface of her mind , like tiny bubbles in a pot growing to boil . This was the Contessa 's blue glass book of memories that Miss Temple had absorbed  --  and she shuddered to realize that each tiny bubble of memory found an echo in her flesh , each one threatening to expand to prominence in her mind , until the memory blotted out the present altogether . She had peered into the shimmering depths of the blue glass and been changed . How many of its memories had she consumed  --  experienced in her own body  --  and thus made her own ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now remember ? The Contessa 's book was a catalog of insidious and unmentionable delight , the sensual experience of a thousand souls crammed together . The more Miss Temple thought about it the more insistent the memories became . Her face flushed . Her breath quickened . Her nostrils flared with anger . She would not have it . <br> She jerked open the door . Before her two women huddled over a large woven basket near an iron stove . At the sound of the door both looked up , faces blank with surprise . They wore plain dresses , soiled aprons , and heavy shoes , with their hair stuffed tightly under woolen caps  --  a mother and a daughter , sharing a thick nose and a certain flatness about the eyes . Miss Temple smiled primly and noticed that the basket was bundled full of linens quite broadly stained with blood . The younger of the two abruptly upended the pile to obscure the stains and shoved the entire basket from view behind the stove . The older turned to Miss Temple with a doting smile  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it not appeared as so open a distraction from the basket  --  and rubbed her chapped hands together . <br> " Good day , " said Miss Temple . <br> " You are awake ! " The woman 's voice bore an accent Miss Temple had heard before , from the mouths of sailors . <br> " Exactly so , " replied Miss Temple . " And though I do not intend any inconvenience , it is true that I require rather many things in a short time . I should like breakfast  --  I have no sense of the time , so perhaps it is more supper I should ask for  --  and if possible a bath , and then some clothing , and more than anything , information : where precisely might I be , and where are my companions ? And , of course , who are you ? " she added , smiling again . " I am sure you have been instrumental to my recovery . I trust I was not a burden . One never enjoys being ill  --  often one calls out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all  --  I have no memory of coming here  --  so I trust you will accept my open regrets for any . . . well , for anything untoward . I do indeed feel much better . Some tea would be lovely . And toast  --  toast of any kind . And , yes , something to wear . And news . Indeed , most of all news . " <br> She smiled at them , expectant and , she hoped , the picture of kind gratitude . The women stared at her for perhaps four seconds , when the older suddenly clapped her hands , startling a squeak from the girl as if she had been pinched . At once the poor thing darted from the room , pausing only to snatch up the basket as she went . <br> " Bette will come back with food , " the woman announced , lips pursed , her hands again rubbing together . " Perhaps you will sit by the stove . " <br> She indicated a rough wooden stool , but before Miss Temple could respond the woman took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cinders beneath her feet , Miss Temple sat  --  for it was cold outside of her blanket , and much warmer by the stove . <br> " What is your name ? " asked Miss Temple . " And where are we ? I expect you know my name  --  undoubtedly my companions have spoken of how we came to be here . I should actually be quite curious what they said  --  " <br> " I am Lina , " the woman said . " I will make tea . " <br> The woman brusquely turned away , stepping closer to the stove and placing an iron kettle onto its flat , oily top . Keeping her back to Miss Temple , Lina crossed to a low , humble cupboard for a teapot and metal mug , and a small stoppered jar that held a dusty inch of black tea  --  each action making clear there was scarce hope of a lemon . <br> " And where are we exactly ? " asked Miss Temple , even in her weakened state not entirely pleased with having to repeat herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not to have heard . Rolling her eyes , Miss Temple stood and without another word walked past the woman to the door through which Bette had disappeared . There was a sharp exhalation from Lina as Miss Temple pulled it open , but a moment later she was through , shutting it behind her and slipping a conveniently placed wooden latch . Lina yanked on the door from the other side . Miss Temple ignored her . <br> Bette  --  who Miss Temple now saw , as the girl looked up at her with shock  --  was , if not exactly fat , what one might in charity term healthy , with a wide , pale pink neck and heavy arms that shook the entirety of her torso when they worked . At the moment Miss Temple entered Bette had been fully occupied  --  not with any meal at all , but in scrubbing the blood-soaked bedding in a steaming bucket of water , crimson-tinged soap suds lathering nearly to each elbow . <br> " Hello again , " said Miss Temple . " Lina is making my tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite keen for company . And whatever are you doing ? " <br> Bette shifted on her feet , torn between the urge to hide the blood and to curtsey to a social superior , and succeeded only in losing her balance and sitting down on the floor . The impact caused one black-booted foot to kick the tub , launching a jet of bloody foam into the air . <br> The latched door rattled again . Miss Temple studied the room , of a piece with where she had slept  --  dark wooden beams with a wall of inset shelves , all covered with boxes and pots and jars , one half taken up with soaps and oils and the other equally occupied with fishing paraphernalia . There were two more wooden tubs the size of the one Bette presently used , and the width of the room was spread with hanging cords upon which to dry things . Miss Temple saw these were strung with more bedding , and nothing she might wear . <br> " That seems a lot of blood , " said Miss Temple . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birth of a child ? " <br> Bette shook her head . Miss Temple nodded seriously . <br> " I see . Someone has been injured ? " <br> Bette nodded . <br> " Killed ? " <br> Bette nodded again . <br> " And poor you with the horrid task of washing it out . " Miss Temple continued to ignore the rattling door behind her . She stepped to one of the other tubs , perching herself on its edge . " Do you know what happened ? " <br> Bette glanced past Miss Temple to the door . Miss Temple leaned closer to the girl . <br> " Between ourselves . " <br> Bette 's hesitant answer was so hushed to be nearly inaudible . <br> " It was the storm . . . " <br> She wriggled back onto her toes and sank her hands once more into the tub , as if resuming her work would balance the impulse to gossip . <br> " What storm ? " <br> " After you came ashore . " <br> " I remember no storm , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state to mark it  --  go on . " <br> " It rained for two days , " whispered the girl . " And when it was over the beaches were different , and trees had come down , and the river had flooded the forest . That was why they said  --  because of the forest  --  " <br> " The blood , Bette . " Miss Temple attempted to be patient . " Blood , not forests . " <br> " But they said that was why . No one had called on Jorgens since the storm , because he lived near the river , and the path was washed away . When someone thought to call they found . . . they found them dead . Jorgens and his wife . The door opened , dogs gone , their . . . their throats . . . and then  --  " <br> Lina banged on the door , frightening the girl to silence . Miss Temple spun around and barked with annoyance , " I will have my tea when I am ready for it ! " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must come out at once  --  there is no time ! " <br> Continues ...
