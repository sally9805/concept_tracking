Part Two , Chapter One : ART 127 . INTRODUCTION TO COMMERCIAL ART . INSTR. : PROF . W. SORBECK , BFA Tues . &; Thurs. , 2:25 P.M. Room 207 , Baxter Bldg. ( formerly Wexler Science Hall ) DESCR : A fundamental exploration of the applied arts . Credits : 3 I got there at quarter past two . A dozen or so kids dotted the benches and floor in the hall facing the classroom I recognized Treat Dempsey and two other guys from North Halls . Himillsy was seated , her shiny black helmet of hair and raccoon mascara glowering over a sundress she 'd made in Textiles 202 . The fabric was covered with a pattern of oranges and bananas that would have seemed perfectly benign on anyone else . She was talking to a very tall boyish man with terrible skin . The door to 207 was n't locked , but a sign , ink on horizontal notebook paper , was taped to it : INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHIC DESIGN Formerly mislabeled Introduction to Commercial Art ENTER THE CLASSROOM AT EXACTLY 2:25 P.M. WS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smirking , sunbeam bright . I recognized the look and prepared myself it was the sort of smile that made you check your fly . Suddenly she was nudging me to the door , giddy with girlish urgency I was Rin Tin Tin and she lay pinned under a tree . " Go on , hurry ! Do n't think about me ! Run ! Save yourself ! " I resisted , with success . " Rage before beauty ... " I held one arm to my chest and extended the other towards the door . She returned a howl of delighted disapproval and slid over to make space for me on the bench . " This is Mike , " she gestured vaguely to the beanpole , who , now that I was seated , seemed even longer and lankier . Mike Crenck was ancient maybe even thirty . As he nodded my way and made a small noise , the expression on his face made me want to say " Do n't worry , I 'm not going to hurt you . " His hair was sandy colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also dirt . " What are y'all waiting for ? " Maybelle was at the far end of the hallway , lugging her burden of paints , pencils , rulers , and drawing tools charging towards us with epic resolve . Only Mabes could turn walking down the hall into Lee 's campaign at Gettysburg . " For you . Go on in . " Mills was swinging her legs . Maybelle ignored her and read the sign . " Well . Miss Sorbeck is very specific , is n't she ? " " Probably moonlights as a Swiss cuckoo , " said Hims , as she tortured a paper clip . I sighed and leaned against the wall . What a bore this was going to be , like every other class at State . At least I talked Mills into taking it . She 'd liven it up . At twenty-five after , we made our listless way into 207 and found seats . A minute or two of silence . Then , from behind us : " That was lousy . Do it again . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded like . But I can tell you what it did . I can say it pinned me like a Monarch to its specimen box and made me squint . It turned the air into a hot solid . Wait that 's not good enough it ... was a wave you thought you could ride , until you did , and came up bloody . I can tell you it was the sound of Ultimate Discontent the voice that , after a long life of committing horrible crimes , you could expect to hear just after you died . I turned , opened my eyes . There , leaning against the back wall , was Gary Cooper 's fraternal twin ( High Noon-era ) in a white dress shirt and loosened rep tie , gray flannel trousers , and a pipe driven into his clenched teeth . But I bet Gary never forgave him because between the two this guy got all the looks which were now on the other side of Stellar but not far . He was big . Not fat , not at all . Big . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him was to disappoint him . " I said . Do it . Again . " And boy , did we ever . We rose with a collective jolt , filed out into the hallway , and exchanged puzzled glances . What to do next ? " There must be some mistake , " offered Maybelle . " He must think we 're here for something else . Maybe he 's not the right teacher at all . Once at Miss Cress 's I spent an entire term in Pillows when I was supposed to be in Napkins . I almost did n't graduate . It was just crazy . " Treat and the two he came with were heading down the hall for the stairwell . I called to him . " Where 're you guys going ? " He turned . " To see if we can still audit Psych One-ten . " Then he shot a wild-eyed face to the door of 207 and they were gone . Hims was jubilant fortified by the weirdness and confusion . " Love it ! Kicked out already and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ! " " But we did it wrong somehow last time . " Maybelle bit her lip . " What did he mean ? " " He means do it with some style , " said Mills . " Go in like ... oh ... Isadora Duncan . " " Who ? " " Jesus . Agnes de Mille , then . " " I do n't " " Like a dancer in Oklahoma . Go ahead . Kick up your heels . He 'll love it . We 'll be right behind you . " " Are you sure ? " She pondered it . " I loved Oklahoma , saw it three times . They had such spirit , those poor people . Do you think ... ? " " Absolutely . He wants theater . I 'm going to be Blind Pew from Treasure Island . I 'll use my ruler as a tapping stick . Be fun ! " She turned to me . " What are you going to be ? " In eternally horrified thrall to you , alas . " I 'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , some with a little more enthusiasm than before . Maybelle bounded into the room , clicked her heels , and shouted , " Yeeeehah ! ! " Sorbeck was stone-faced . Himillsy followed her up and gave him a very desperate , apologetic glance . I was next , and before I sat down , something came over me and I pivoted , clicked my heels together , and did a slow , courtly bow . Arms crossed . Did n't move . Once we were all reseated , he went to the front of the room and started bobbing his head at each of us . Then , " Shit . Only three went AWOL ? " Mike raised his hand and said in a voice that sounded like Bing Crosby before puberty . " I , I think so . " And then , bam ! The first of his magical transformations : now a human being almost friendly . " I must be losing my touch . " He smiled and turned the air into a gas again and became the most beguiling person on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to work on that . You see , there 's still eighteen people here . The class works better with twelve , best with fewer . Nine or ten is ideal . Of course , the Cookie Cutters in the front office of this Idiot Factory wo n't allow me to limit it to that , but I 'm not worried . I 'll whittle you down . No doubts . " I did n't like the sound of that . " Before we go on , I should state , it 's a fact : Nothing worth knowing can ever be taught in a classroom . " No one stirred . " Well . Nobody fell for that . Now . Let 's see what we 've got . " He walked across the front of the room , and I was reminded of a shark I once saw during a high school field trip it was turning in a tank of cloudy water , and I just kept staring at it , thinking , " How can something so huge and bulky move with such efficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore down Christ on me . " Son , what is the name of this class ? " His face : the Arrow shirt man after some hard , hard years . Survivalist reflexes almost made me shriek " Introduction to Commercial Art ! " Almost . At the last second I remembered the sign . I cleared my throat . " Introduction to Graphic Desi " " Right ! ! " God . " Very good . You can stay . For now . " Maybelle was next . " Honey , can you tell me what Graphic Design is ? " She thought for a moment . " No . I 'm afraid not , " all eager smiles . " That 's why I 'm here , I suppose . " He seemed to accept that . " All right . Fair enough , you 're in . " Back to Mike . Sorbeck folded his arms and leaned down on the table . " What does the world look like ? " " Er , I do n't think I understand the question . " " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reloaded his pipe . " That is a problem . " Everyone , understand : When you walk through that door you become a graphic designer . Whether or not you stay one after you leave is up to you , but I 'd recommend you wear the mantle full time , all semester . We 'll be spending the next weeks attempting to figure out what this means to be a designer , graphic or otherwise . " Now who would like to take a little eye test ? You two . " He gestured to Himillsy and the girl next to her a real **31;489;TOOLONG type , with freckles and rust-colored ringlets propped up by two pink barrettes shaped like butterflies . " Up to the front of the room please , and face the class . " Hims rolled her eyes as she passed me . Then he said , serious as a cancer : " Okay , I want you ladies to close your eyes . NO peeking or out the door with you both . I 'm watching . Understand ? " They did as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll start with the pigtails . Sweetheart ? " " Yes ? " said Margaret . " What color is the floor ? " " Uh . " She started to look down , and checked herself . Lids clenched tight . " I really , could n't say for sure . " " I see . How about the walls ? " " Oh . I. Did n't get a good look at them . Green ? " " Hmm . How many windows are in this room ? " " Gee . I ... did n't count . " " Describe the dress of the girl next to you . " " Uh , orange . " Very fidgety . " Her shoes . " Silence . " My shoes . What color ? " " Brown ? " Hims had her hands clasped behind her through all of this , her tiny weight on her left leg . Smiling . Head tilted to the ceiling . Bored , bored , bored . " Pigtails , we have to teach you how to see . Either that or get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle and a lot of patience . " Titters in the room . Then , quite grave : " You are a designer . You have to eat the world with your eyes . You must look at everything as if you 're going to die in the next five minutes , because in the relative scheme of things , you are . You ca n't miss a trick . Now , you , girly . " He meant Himillsy . " In the fruit dress . What colo " " The floor , originally I suppose , was white . As one would like to imagine that slush in the gutter was once new-fallen snow . Linoleum . Of the grade ... usually found in Sears just before they remodeled . Scuffed now , beyond redemption . " She smirked slightly , into the dark . " Well well well . " His interest was finally sparked the badger at the rabbit hole . " Go on . " " The walls are the shade of caked snot . " He said nothing . " Cinder block . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count them in sections . Probably last washed during the Roosevelt administration . Teddy . " She was off and running arms up into space . " I 'm wearing my own stunning creation I call it ' Fruit Salad Surgery . ' My shoes are boys ' size four patent black leather Buster Browns with kid straps . " She threw her hands crazily to the right . " Miss Nowhere is wearing a thigh-waisted fatigue tent-dress she probably made in her spare time to save money for hair dye . " Margaret 's eyes snapped open . " speaking of which , someone might tell her that two killer moths the color of my tongue are attacking her head as I speak . " " Hey ! " " And you , sir , since you asked , are shod in a pair of groaning black ox-bloods that really ought to be thrown away . You obviously are n't married , or Mrs. Sorbeck would have returned them apologetically to the beast they were ripped from , when you were n't looking , years ago . " He chuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking . And ? " " I 'm stuffed . " She opened her lids . " My eyeballs are ready to burp their heads off . " She curtsied and headed for her seat . Margaret followed in a slump . I pictured those wavy cartoon heat lines rising from her head , and almost started to clap . Sorbeck was as amused as I ever would see him . Sober , anyway . " You 're a pip , Miss Molecule . " She basked in the praise . " Kiddies , you all should have been able to do that . Sans , I would hope , " he threw a second 's dismissive glance at Himillsy , " the undergraduate humor . " Hims 's face broke and she made her eyes dark slits . She did n't like that . Not at all . " The Cookie Cutters ca n't think about anything beyond selling cookies , so they would have you believe this class is the Introduction to Commercial Art . It is not . Should that give you cause to leave this room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or having to think . " Nobody did . Leave , I mean . " But I 've been put in charge of the store here , and I say it 's Introduction to Graphic Design . The difference is as crucial as it is enormous as important as the difference between pre- and postwar America . Uncle Sam ... is Commercial Art . The American Flag is Graphic Design . Commercial Art tries to make you buy things . Graphic Design gives you ideas . One natters on and on , the other actually has something to say . They use the same tools words , pictures , colors . The difference , as you 'll be seeing , and as you 'll be showing me , is how . " He bowed his head and paused , as if to take on a new load of thoughts . Then he paced , slowly , up and down the right side of the room . " You 're lucky . I envy you this is an interesting time for Graphic Design . Even though it 's existed since the dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a name for it until 1928 , when a book designer named William Addison Dwiggins got sick of the term ' Graphic Arts ' and changed it in print , naturally . And he was right . It 's not Art . And Art is not Design , though it used to be . " He stopped , relit his pipe . Drew it in . " Design is , literally , purposeful planning . Graphic Design , then , is the form those plans will take . " More thoughts . " A bazillion years ago , some poor son of a bitch Cro-Magnon scratched a drawing of a buffalo onto the wall of his cave . He did n't do it because his muse had called to him , or to explore the texture of bauxite , or to start the **26;522;TOOLONG movement . He did it because he killed a goddamn buffalo and he wanted someone else to know about it , after he was gone . He had a specific , definable purpose for making a piece of visual information . The first one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downhill from there is a matter of debate for another time , but the truth is Art and Design only finally parted ways in the nineteenth century , with the introduction of photography . Now Ssmile ! Zogg can take a picture of his Buffalo and save all those tedious drafting skills for ... well , something else . " Sorbeck pulled a chair up to the front , sat , and propped his legs up on a desk , leaning back , hands behind his head . " Which is no small matter . You see , photography opened up quite a little Pandora 's box , kiddies . Do you have any idea ? " A quick scan of the room made it clear we did n't . " Once we no longer had to depend on drawing and painting to record our existence once they became an option they mutated ... into a form of expression . And Art for its own sake , God help us , was born . " But Graphic Design for its own sake will never happen , because the concept cancels itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graphic Design , it 's ... " He pumped his fist rapidly up and down over his lap and started breathing in spasms . " ... makin ' ART . " My goodness . " Not that Design ca n't have ... a look , a style in fact it has to , even if the style is ' no style ' but by definition , Design must always be in service to solving a problem , or it 's not Design . I will not , so help me , ever attempt to define what Art is . But I know what it no longer is , and that 's Graphic Design . " Now , as for Commercial Art , I could be crass and say the term is both repetitive and redundant , but that 's too easy . Better to say the term is too limiting and too humiliating . I mean , do you really want to be a Commercial Artist ? " He somehow made his face ugly with those last two words , for just a second , then stood . Summing up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can write either ' Smoke Gets In Your Eyes ' or The Marriage of Figaro . " Twenty-six letters : Marjorie Morningstar or Ulysses . " The man-made world means exactly that . There is n't an inch of it that does n't have to be dealt with , figured out , executed . And it 's waiting for you to decide what it 's going to look like . Of course that 's not true , but for this class you have to believe it . " So . Is it caked snot ? " Or five coats of lacquered enamel ? " We did n't dare make a peep . I was exhausted just listening . " Alright . Here 's your first assignment ... " * * * " I wish I had a picture of him . Then my word could be ' bastard . ' Problem solved . " Himillsy was burrowing through her purse , her last Camel hanging from her mouth for dear life . " Bloody matches ... " For our first formal Graphic Design critique we had to select a word and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea was to make it look appropriate to what it said . Sounds simple enough , until you try it everything you think of is instant clich . Himillsy and I met at Zingorelli 's Pizza their tomato-garlic strombolis could set off Vesuvius the night before it was due , to commiserate . " How about the word ' red , ' in red ? " I asked . " Too easy . He 'll hate it . There they are ... " Breath a Sicilian stink bomb , she lit her smoke and motioned for her sixth Coke . " Plus like he said it 's too repetitive . He 's looking for more . " A truck pulled up and parked on the curb outside the window next to our booth . It was huge . Lost in thought , I found myself trying to read the lettering on the side , but only part of it was in view , and all I could make out , just barely , was the word ' big . ' Hmm . Now there was an idea . Was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck , and seeing not what it is , but what could be made of it ? Learning from it ? I decided yes . It was that moment when the mind , instead of obsessively pacing the prison of its own puzzlement , suddenly , instinctively , deliriously , discovers a way to make wings out of wax and fly the maze . " What if the word was ' big ' ... " I started , " but you just showed a white piece of paper ? " She waited for me to explain . I said , " Because it 's so big , you ca n't see it all . " She took a drag . " Interesting , but something about it ... is n't right . " Sent smoke to the ceiling . " I would n't if I were you . " Dissmissal Herself . Ouch . Moment : RIP . " Yeah , I guess . What 's everybody else doing ? " A foreign concept . " What ? Who cares ? " Himillsy 's camaraderie was often cut with a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That one guy , Mike , " I said , " he 's been working on it for two nights , in the Belly . " ( The Visual Arts building 's basement workroom , where you went when you really needed to spread out . When you needed surfaces . ) I already suspected that Mike was going to be one of those humble show-off types who worked harder than everybody else on each project and became teacher 's pet . Annoying . " Pizza Face ? " she sniffed . " Bully for him . Vote him Class Prez . " " Maybe I should try a noun . What are you going to do ? " " Skip class . " " Seriously . " " Oh I do n't know . I 'll do what I always do . " She drained her glass , stubbed out her Camel 's tail . We got up to leave . " I 'll think of something at the last minute . Drop you ? " * * * BASIC INTERLUDE ( i ) Morning . Today we are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could say , " Things go from left to right , " and all of you would grasp the weight of the situation then I would just say it and that would be that and we could just go home for today because , really , that 's enough . No , too much for one day , actually . The best way would be to say , " Things go from left " on Tuesday , let it sink in , and then say " to right " on Thursday . And you know how you 'd picture it ? You 'd picture Tuesday on the left , and Thursday on the right , and we 'd be all set . In fact , why the hell did n't I do that ? Damn . Too late . Anyway , that would assume this circumstance does n't require some explanation , and as I survey this room , it 's clear to me it does . Look . Suppose you were a general in battle someplace and you got wind the enemy was plotting to invade your territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonsabitches were going to land and strike , you 'd have the advantage , right ? Well , that 's it . You , you all have the advantage . The page , the poster , the surface you are working on THAT 'S your territory , and they are going to invade . Fine , let them . That 's what you want anyway . But be ready . They are coming in from the left . Always , always always , always ! ! This , as you would imagine , can be extremely useful to know . For example , if the director of a play wants to give more importance to one character than the others , where do you think he 's going to place him on stage ? See ? You invisibly assign a hierarchy of importance and meaning to the elements you work with by deciding where they go on the page . We are the Western world . We read , see , think . Left . To . Right . We ca n't help it . You have few givens in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Use it .
