NEW Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin may be the most recognized mayor in the country . Since Hurricane Katrina ravaged his city one year ago , he has been in the national and international spotlight . And while he has taken a lot of heat for the way some things were handled prior to , during and after the storm , Nagin has defied the critics by not only winning re-election , but also the support of a majority of the city 's residents and business community . During a press conference to announce the reopening of the city 's first swimming pool since Katrina , Nagin fielded several questions from EBONY and other media . One year after Katrina , do you feel good about where the city is right now ? Feeling good is a relative term . I feel that we are making progress . It 's incremental progress . We have to keep pushing ourselves , both government and residents , to accelerate that progress . I 'm hoping pretty soon we 're going to hit a tipping point where all the change is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing . I think we are close . Where does the city stand in the recovery process ? I have been working behind the scenes to bring a lot of different players together to fine-tune our planning process . We started out going in a direction with " Bring Back New Orleans . " We thought FEMA was going to fund the neighborhood planning process . It did n't . The council got the planning process going in some of the most devastated areas . Now we have the Rockefeller Foundation that is coming forward . We are trying to put together a process that , at the end of the day , will deliver a master plan . How much input will you seek from residents ? We have neighborhood groups that feel very empowered about what their communities are going to look like in the future . I do not think that it is government 's role to specifically tell people where they can and can not live . I think homeowners and neighborhoods should go through a process where they are empowered and come to an intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this city . And I 'm very comfortable with that . What do you say to those people who say that the city is moving too slowly ? Everybody says , " Why is it taking so long ? " This rebuilding of New Orleans , I would rather get it right than to do it too fast . My guiding principle is that the neighborhood and the residents should drive the plan and process . I do n't want to see a top-down process because New Orleans is so unique and so distinctive with its various neighborhoods , and the neighbors know it the best . It 's only nine months in July since 80 percent of our city was under water . As I look at New York , and see what they have done , it 's five or six years later since 9/11 , and they are still planning to reconstruct the World Trade Center . There 's no manual . There 's no precedent for this . We really do n't know if we 're going too fast or too slow . I know that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the responsibility of the National Guard as it patrols certain areas of the city ? The National Guard is fanned out in the non-occupied and the less-occupied parts of the city . We now have the presence in the occupied areas of the city where we are starting to make a difference in curbing crime in those neighborhoods . I 'm getting great feedback from every area of the city . At this point , what 's being done for the children of the city ? As part of our 100-Day Plan , we want to improve the quality of life for our community as we continue to go through this recovery . Our children are our future . We all know that one of the most important contributions we can make as a community is to deal with our young people and make sure that they have options . A good education and healthy youth development are the keys to giving our kids a better future . As we continue to recover from Hurricane Katrina , we wanted to make a specific commitment , as we come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have summer programs . We have Operation Reach , which will give our children education activities , and cultural activities . We have tried to get as many programs up and running as possible . Sidebar Days after Hurricane Katrina battered New Orleans , President Bush visited the city to observe the recovery efforts . He is joined by ( I. to r . ) Vice Admiral Thad Allen , Mayor Ray Nagin and Lt. Gen. Russel Honor , commander of the relief effort . At right , Nagin , who defeated Lt. Gov . Mitch Landrieu , is sworn-in for a second term by Judge Ronald Sholes at the Mortal Convention Center . Sidebar New Orleans ' Police Superintendent Has His Say HE took control of a decimated police department shortly after Hurricane Katrina . Since then , NEW ORLEANS POLICE SUPERINTENDENT WARREN J. RILEY not only led his officers through the storm , but he has also regained control of the city and has made positive plans for the future . Although he says he has gotten very little sleep since Katrina , and had taken very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an exclusive interview , where he talked about everything from the need for National Guard troops to the unfairness of the national media . How has the New Orleans Police Department been affected by Hurricane Katrina ? Internally , with the aftermath of Katrina , we 've had to deal with some of the most unique circumstances in the history of law enforcement . Our numbers right now are down . We 've had issues to deal with like abandonment , where we fired some 84 police officers who were not here for the storm . We had two police officers who committed suicide . We have 300 police officers still living in hotel rooms . Over 800 of our officers lost their homes , completely wiped out by the storm . Not only their homes but all of their possessions . And some of those officers have not come back to the city . The state of the police department is relatively good , considering what we 've been through . I 'm the superintendent of police , and I 'm in a trailer . Our headquarters received 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district stations flooded . We lost 298 cars , and have replaced about 90 percent of those ... What people around the country ca n't imagine is that this city was almost completely wiped out by the storm , and the devastation is far more than anyone can imagine . More than 80 percent of the city was covered by water . And it was here for 21 days . We were reduced to a third-world country for a significant period of time ... It was the closest thing to war that I 've experienced . You 've worked side-by-side with members of the police department for some time . How did you feel about those officers who jumped ship before , during and after the storm ? Disappointed . Because , although some of them felt like they had a really good reason , our procedures allow for our officers to get their families out of town in certain situations . If you look at our citizens who stayed behind , and we never would have imagined that 50,000 people would stay behind , whether they were middle-class , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire department . Thafs why we were supposed to be here ; that 's why we 're here . So 84 who were fired , desired to be fired , regardless of the circumstance . When things get tough , that 's when people need us the most . And that 's when we need to be here the most . It 's not only disappointing to the citizens , but disappointing to the fellow officers . When you look back on the whole Hurricane Katrina tragedy , what frustrates you the most ? There have been times that I have been frustrated from what I call irresponsible reporting . I have said things that have been reported incorrectly . This city is known as an AfricanAmerican city , and I feel like we have been beat up on . Our mayor has been strong , he has done a great job . There has been progress , but it has n't been recognized . Every little thing that 's wrong is pointed out over and over and over . I assure you that if this was the Hamptons or Kennebunkport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the resources and the positive things . But we keep getting beat up on . This is a city that has been through one of the worst catastrophes in American history . We should have received a lot more support . We should be pulled up , not pulled down . And we are being pulled down . Sidebar " There 's no precedent for this . We do n't really know if we 're going too fast or too slow . " // <p>
