Section : REVIEW ESSAY PREFORMATTED TABLE Live8 and G8 <p> Bob Geldof 's campaign to " Make Poverty History " reached a crescendo in July 2005 , when Live8 , the biggest rock concert in history , was held with the aim of influencing the G8 meeting in nearby Gleneagles . The idea was to raise voices rather than money for Africa : the sound , so it was reported , was deafening . Did the hard of hearing listen ? It seems likely that the politicians responded with declarations and promises that were in excess of those that would otherwise have been made . But what matters , always assuming that the adopted policies are the appropriate ones , is whether they are acted on when the noise dies away . On this crucial issue no judgment can as yet be made. 1 <p> However , other significant dimensions of Live8 can be assessed . It was ( and still is , if the organizers have their way ) a mass movement dedicated to ending injustice done to others . In this respect , Live8 is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolish the slave trade and slavery . Like the abolitionist movement , Live8 is a broad coalition held together by a single issue . In both cases , too , the issue lay abroad and involved no potentially divisive attack on the status quo at home . We now know that the abolitionist cause was also a popular one that involved men and women across regions and social classes . Today the scale is different because the technology available in the current , postcolonial phase of globalization has enabled Live8 to reach many more millions across the whole world . But the essential purpose remains , even though one organization mobilized an emerging national moral sensibility while the other draws on and also helps to create a new global civic consciousness . Both campaigns operated within , as well as outside , the established power structure . Wilberforce , like Geldof , counted a prime minister as a friend , moved easily in the corridors of power , and was an able publicist . For all the differences between them , the two advocates have in common the moral radicalism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards . The hazards lie elsewhere : in the risk of being compromised by the forces they seek to influence , and in the danger of succumbing to what might be called philanthropy fatigue . <p> There is also a connection between Live8 and academic purpose . When Bono writes a Foreword to Jeffrey Sachs 's The End of Poverty ( 2005 ) and Geldof is quoted approvingly on the front cover of the Commission for Africa 's Our Common Interest ( 2005 ) , it is surely time for scribes and specialists to sit up and take notice . It is not that the role of scholars is being usurped , though it might be argued that the public intellectuals of yesteryear , such as Einstein and Russell , have no counterparts of comparable stature today . But even economists , who are particularly closely involved with development issues , have rarely had starring roles in publicity campaigns of this kind , while historians are habitually seen , when seen at all , as hewers of wood and drawers of water for the higher social sciences . What has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Injustice remains , but the means of advertising it have been transformed by the rise to prominence and power of the new aristocracy of the media , which in turn has been made possible by the transformation of the means of communication and the consequent shrinkage of the world . <p> The response to these developments , as I see it , should not be to regret the loss of academic innocence or to disdain the vulgarities that accompany popularization but to react positively to the opportunities they present . As far as historians are concerned , the huge and very visible publicity now being given to the plight of Africans in their own continent poses a challenge that ought to capture the imagination and engage the expertise of the next generation of researchers , as it has been very largely bypassed by the last one . When the merits of postmodernism have been allowed , it has to be acknowledged that the issues that dominated so much historical thinking during the 1990s were scarcely conducive to hardheaded investigation of the material world . A preoccupation with perceptions was reinforced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction against " structural " history and what was called the " totalizing project " further reinforced the notion that the study of history should focus on the particular , the contingent , and the indeterminate . The true task of the historian was to unmask false images ; beyond that lay uncertainties that could never be resolved . The reaction against " economistic " Marxism was complete ; the rejection of " orthodox " economics was so total that the subject was scarcely mentioned , or , it would seem , examined . So few students wished to undertake research into the economic history of what used to be called the Third World that a visiting alien could be excused for thinking that the problem of poverty had been solved , whereas it had simply been bypassed. 2 The Revival of African Economic History ? <p> Large , exciting opportunities now await . This is a moment when historiography can be reshaped . The classic problems of economic development can be reappraised in the light of new thinking inspired by the globalized order that has emerged following decolonization and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got the message , historians of Africa ought not to be too far behind . Moreover , there is an urgent need to inject some academic rigor into the public debate on poverty in Africa and to advertise the importance of inserting an understanding of history into the formulation of policy . Geldof is no Russell , even though he reaches a far greater audience , and the presentation of the issues needs ultimately to be anchored in firm knowledge of the research on Africa completed during the past half-century . This is true both of the discussion of external issues , such as trade and aid , and of internal considerations such as the role of ethnicity and the record of governments . It applies , too , to assessments of the legacy of precolonial Africa and to the debate over the costs and benefits of colonial rule . The problem of poverty is too big to be left entirely to politicians and too complex to be left entirely to economists . The World Bank 's oscillations between " getting prices right " and " bringing the state back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uncertainty of policy prescriptions , and the need for multiple inputs if solutions are to be found . <p> The connection between these very general reflections on Live8 and the publication of a very detailed study of the economic history of Asante might now appear less improbable than at first sight . Gareth Austin 's large and complex study will never become a handbook for the supporters of Live8 , but it is highly relevant for understanding poverty in Africa , or , put another way , for understanding how indigenous resources have been activated and what the results have been in terms of living standards and welfare . Of course , Austin writes as a historian rather than as a policy-maker . As a historian he has chosen to tackle the most important and most difficult of research topics , the history of agriculture in Africa . In doing so , he has written a history " from below " that enables us to hear the voices of the " subalterns " and other even less audible ranks of society. 3 As far as policy-makers are concerned , Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy involves an assessment of factor markets , growth paths , and constraints that is directly relevant to development economists and those who formulate policy . The fact that the World Bank has shown an increasing awareness of the importance of institutions to the development process is an encouraging sign . At the same time , the historical dimension , where present , is often still treated as a summary " background " consisting of stereotypes that historians themselves have long discarded. 4 Ghana is currently regarded as being a modest success story in that it has recovered recently from a long period of economic decline . But the debate about the causes of that recovery is concerned mainly with evaluating the efficacy of the World Bank 's structural adjustment policy . Anyone reading Austin 's book will see that this analysis is far too restrictive : Ghana 's fortunes rest on developments that began two hundred years ago and on resources that were activated by a multiplicity of actors - mostly a long way from governments of all kinds . The larger picture needs to be understood and kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be overstated . <p> Asante lends itself to large , well-ruminated books . This is partly because of the richness of the source materials , at least for the period since the 18th century , and partly because of the extraordinarily high standard of scholarship set initially by Ivor Wilks 's magnum opus and continued by Tom McCaskie and others. 5 Historians have produced individual research of comparable stature on African states elsewhere : Robin Law on Oyo and Joseph Miller on the Mbundu states of Angola are two fine examples , and remarkable revisionist work is now appearing on the Zulu. 6 Nevertheless , it is hard to think of an equivalent cluster of studies that has the range and depth of the research now available on the kingdom of Asante . <p> Gareth Austin 's contribution to this literature fits the requirements of Asante studies perfectly , being both long in production and impressively weighty . The text is much more than the outgrowth of a 1984 Ph.D . dissertation. 7 In fact , the dissertation , which dealt with Amansie ( Bekwai ) District , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Austin calls the Asante " heartland . " The result , 20 years later , is virtually the size of two books rather than one , and covers the colonial period as well as the 19th century . Moreover , Austin has also published a series of important essays on Asante while writing this book ; some are drawn on in the present work but none is reproduced in entirety and a number are referred to only in passing . Readers should be aware of this additional set of references because , despite its size , Austin 's present text still needs to be related to his previous work to achieve a full understanding of several major issues - the rise of commoners in the 19th century being just one important example. 8 <p> Today , the decision not to publish a Ph.D . dissertation has to be regarded as a highly risky academic strategy , and in all likelihood a disastrous one , at least for a budding academic . The spreading influence of American academia has ensured that all Ph.D . dissertations have to be published , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements have had some benign consequences , but they have also tended to elevate quantity above quality , with the result that a vast amount of indifferent work has now to be read or at least surveyed . Of course delay has its drawbacks too . As the subject moves on and the tide recedes , the slow-moving author can find himself exposed with little more than his outdated problematic to cover him . Two conditions have to be present if this fate is to be avoided : the author has be to lucky to reappear at a moment when the historiographical mood is favorable ; and the decision to " postpone present consumption for the sake of future returns " has to deliver the goods to the shareholders , who want a big result and not merely added intricacies and refinements . <p> As far as the historiographical mood is concerned , Austin may have been fortunate in his timing . As suggested above , there are signs that economic history is now beginning to improve its standing , and may well become fashionable again . What goes around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his research during the " golden age " of African economic history in the 1970s and 80s , when the assault on modernization theory , followed by the influence of the dependency thesis and Marxism , gave both impetus and excitement to the task of uncovering , in the phrase of the day , " the roots of underdevelopment . " But Austin 's Ph.D . was not completed until 1984 . Had he published a revised version in the late 1980s , he might well have encountered a less receptive audience because by then interest in the material past , grand structures , and long-run developments had given way to postmodernist preoccupations with representations combined with skepticism about the " totalizing project . " Today , a new and growing interest in the historical origins of globalization has begun to revive the study of economic history - not least because many minds have been concentrated by the tragic events of 9/11 , which provided dramatic evidence that the ex-empire was striking back in ways that were self-evidently material as well as symbolic . 9 <p> On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regained the heights they reached in the 1970s and 1980s , and African economic history in particular has remained becalmed , even though important individual studies have been published since the 1990s. 10 As Austin notes ( p. 4 ) , this is a striking omission because in other respects the period has seen a marked increase in political and public awareness of Africa 's ailments , whether the spread of AIDS or the burden of indebtedness , and a renewed determination among economists and policy-makers to come to grips with the grinding poverty that affects so much of the continent. 11 If Austin 's luck holds , and the revival of interest in economic history extends to Africa , his book will capture the attention of a new generation of researchers and thus help to give the subject a fresh start . <p> Judgment of the second condition , delivering long-term value by delaying publication , must first begin by examining what Austin has set out to achieve . Within the framework of Asante history , he has provided the first full-scale attempt to write an economic history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays tribute to Joseph La Torre 's pioneering but unpublished Ph.D . dissertation , 12 but since no one else has tried to improve on La Torre 's work , there is clearly a sizeable gap to be filled between the predominantly political history provided by Wilks and the predominantly social history provided by McCaskie . Having said this , it is important to note that Austin 's study , though exhaustive , is not intended to cover every aspect of Asante 's economic history . In this case the title of the book performs the refreshing ( because increasingly rare ) service of describing its contents accurately : the text does indeed focus on labor , land , and capital in Ghana , with special reference to Asante . An analysis of factor markets is of course both fundamental and wideranging in the sense of laying the foundation for understanding all other economic activities , but readers should be aware that subjects such as trade and government policy are dealt with in relation to the main theme of the book and not as self-standing entities requiring comprehensive treatment in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is writing in the aftermath of the rise and fall of modernization theory , the dependency thesis , and Marxism , while postmodernism , as noted already , had nothing to offer specialists in economic history . In this historiographical respect , Austin has gained from his decision to take time in producing his magnum opus because he has been able to distance himself from the all-encompassing mood of the moment that can seriously compromise studies conceived and published within the lifespan of a dominant paradigm . He has freed himself from the beguiling illusion that the latest is necessarily the best instead of being merely different . He carries forward debates from an older historiography , where they remain relevant and unresolved , and presents them in a new light . In this respect his book performs an unadvertised service of introducing a new generation of readers to issues that have been lost from sight to all but a handful of members of a now older generation of specialists . The result , set out in Chapters 1 and 2 , is an approach that is eclectic without being random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice theory linked to new institutional economics and insights derived from studies of gender and the environment . Consequently , there is a strong emphasis on property rights and rent-seeking behavior ( as applied in particular by Franois Ruf in his account of the expansion of cocoa farming ) . 13 Austin acknowledges , too , that an approach from the perspective of political economy has to be broad enough to cover social structures and the role of the state , even if , in some respects , he has been obliged to restrain his exploration of the wider consequences of activating the factors of production so that he can keep control of his already massive study . <p> The aim throughout is to provide explanations that avoid the simplicities of earlier approaches while at the same time preventing the data from collapsing into a set of vague multicausal propositions . As the book unfolds , it becomes apparent that Austin looks at every problem with an open mind , though also a well-informed one . Each issue in the evolution of property rights - from the abolition of slavery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise of sharecropping - is analyzed in ways that show how various elements of the theoretical tool-kit can be combined or differentially emphasized to produce an explanation of the particular problem under review . Here again readers have benefited from Austin 's decision to take time to consider his material so thoroughly . Every problem has been thought through and then re-examined in the light of a new insight or new material in an exercise that is self-evident without also being self-regarding . The evidential basis of ( his thinking and rethinking also inspires confidence because the depth and range of the sources used in Ghana and elsewhere is both exhaustive and exhausting . Austin 's handling of his sources is exemplary . He is cautious where the evidence is skimpy ( for example , with respect to the number and percentage of slaves ) , scrupulous in using oral evidence ( p. 494 , n. 86 ) , wary of tempting but possibly unrepresentative evidence ( on the health of women , p. 172 ) , exceptionally careful in checking reputable scholars ( and himself ) in cases of doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , n. 59 , and both on pp. 113-14 ) , and generous to others ( from McPhee to LaTorre ) , when he might easily claim credit for himself . <p> Steering this juggernaut has not been easy . Austin has disciplined himself and guided his readers by setting out his discussion in numbered sections in advance so that it is clear throughout each chapter which topics are going to appear and in what order . What is not laid out so explicitly at the outset is a concise statement of the argument . Austin evidently prefers to allow his interpretation to emerge , in inductive fashion , from his empirical discussion . There are of course impressive precedents for this strategy , but in the case of a very substantial work , such as this one , it places an additional strain on the reader ( or at least on this reader ) . The solution , if this is indeed a problem , is to consult the concluding chapter before engaging with the earlier ones . A second area of slight uncertainty relates to the geographical range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very briefly ( page 1 and Chapter 3 , n. 2 ) , where the author states that " this book focuses on the Asante forest heartlands . " This is helpful as far as it goes , but it does not extend to an explicit discussion of the variety and unevenness of the experiences of , or sources for , different regions within Asante . The presumption must be that there is a sufficient degree of homogeneity in the " forest heartland " to permit generalization , and the author does of course note differences of detail in subsequent discussions of particular topics . But a drawback of spending two decades on one project - to be set against the advantages - may be that what has long been taken for granted by the author is less obvious to readers coming to the subject for the first time . The Asante Economy : An Overview <p> Austin follows his opening historiographical and analytical chapters with two overviews of the whole period from 1807 to 1956 . The first ( Chapter 3 ) deals with the relationship between the slate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter 4 ) treats the changing balance between inputs and outputs . The strategy , evidently , is to provide a framework within which subsequent , more detailed chapters can be placed . The difficulty is that these overviews convey both too much and too little : too much because the combined length of about 65 pages is too long for the essential points to be held firmly in mind ; too little because each chapter is virtually a mini-book that demands expansion. 14 It is at this point that the reader pauses to consider whether an alternative form of organization might have served the book rather better . Had the argument been advertised in neon lights at the outset , it might then have been possible to dispense with the overviews and to have proceeded directly to a sequence of chapters that both expanded the thesis and carried it forward chronologically . No doubt the author considered this possibility , and others , very carefully before adopting the final formula . And it has to be acknowledged that it is easy for reviewers to rearrange the work of others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own material . <p> At all events , Austin begins his story by portraying Asante in the 19th century as a strong state with extensive powers of allocating property rights over land and people , of overseeing the legal and moral order , and of taxing the ambulant and the immobile , the living and the dead . It was also a state with important limits . Asante wielded military power but lacked a standing army and , in the last resort , was unable to exercise a monopoly of coercion . Forest conditions , low population density , fear of revolt , and the availability of exit options all combined to constrain the power of the center . Excesses or failures attributed to the Asante government could , and did , provoke popular resistance . On the whole , however , Austin sees Asante as making a " successful commercial adaptation " ( p. 47 ) to the challenges of the 19th century . The end of the external ( Atlantic ) slave trade was met partly by redeploying slave labor internally to produce increasing exports of gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocoa ( after 1900 ) . This process of adjustment from within was halted in 1874 by military defeat at the hands of the British , which removed the props that upheld Asante 's success , ending the slave trade to the south and encouraging tributary states on the periphery to break away . <p> Thus stated , Austin 's interpretation here seems to be close to Wilks 's sanguine view of Asante development before the British intervention . However , it has to be said , again , that Austin 's purpose is to provide a framework for understanding the mobilization of factors of production rather than to offer an account of the relative importance of internal and external forces in the partition of Africa . This is a matter that needs fuller discussion elsewhere. 16 What is clear is that there was a " crisis of adaptation " and that the economic changes it entailed were under way well before the period of colonial rule began . But Austin 's preferred line of enquiry has the great merit of enabling him to compare the Asante state with the colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and formal annexation in 1902 . Here , Austin 's emphasis is carefully placed on broad continuities . Once the Asante had been defeated , the central power of Kumasi was re-established in accordance with the precepts of indirect rule . The need to work with the chiefs meant making concessions to them . The right of the Asante authorities to control their own resources was upheld . Crucially , the principle of the " freedom to accumulate " that emerged in the late 19th century was endorsed by the new colonial rulers . It allowed cocoa farming to develop rapidly ; it also helped to ensure that property rights in slaves were not abolished with equal speed . <p> The survey of output that follows emphasizes the " emergence of a massive external demand " ( p. 55 ) for produce grown in Asante and considers some of the conventional explanations of this crucial development . Austin here signals his dissent from the vent-for-surplus theory and identifies the natural-resource advantage enjoyed by Asante as forming the precondition for economic growth . The important point here is not just that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that the difference between the value derived from cocoa and that derived from existing food crops constituted a form of economic rent that , under conditions of land abundance , local farmers were able to realize relatively easily . Moreover , the colonial government 's confirmation of Asante control over Asante 's resources meant that strangers who were attracted to the region had to pay a proportion of this rent if they were to gain access to farm land . <p> The second overview chapter ( 4 ) considers how the individual factors of production identified in Chapter 3 were combined during the period as a whole . This investigation , too , involves a reappraisal of a number of accounts found in the standard literature . This is not a matter of slaying long-deceased dragons , still less of trying to flog them back into life . The fact is that these arguments , though hoary , have not been debated by historians for many years , and Austin offers new thoughts and new material on all of them . Austin 's data confirm the presumption that Asante had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) throughout the period under review . Put another way , output was constrained by the availability of factors other than land ; of these labor was the most important . Austin then refines this claim by showing that the high opportunity cost of labor during the rainy season , when all hands were needed on the farms , contrasted with the low opportunity cost of labor during the dry season , which encouraged the use of labor-intensive extra-subsistence activities . This is a simple but powerful observation . It provides an explanation of why technological innovation in nonagricultural activities was so limited ; it also offers a way of reassessing the vent-for-surplus theory of export growth. 17 The vent-for-surplus thesis assumed existence of a leisure reserve that could be drawn on once profitable opportunities arose . Austin disputes this claim principally by arguing that extra-subsistence output was much larger than is consistent with the theory . His own explanation turns on the redeployment of labor from existing activities as the profitability of cocoa-farming became apparent . Some labor units were reallocated from nonagricultural dry-season activities , when the opportunity cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocoa , the main source of labor demand , was harvested . Other units became available when construction of the railway line from the coast freed labor previously employed in porterage , while simultaneously extending the area of profitable cultivation . <p> If this argument is correct , there ought also to have been pressures to adopt labor-saving technology in agriculture . But there was no agricultural revolution in tropical Africa based on the adoption of labor-saving devices , even though " labor was overwhelmingly the main component of cocoa-farmers ' costs " ( p. 87 ) throughout the colonial period . Why was this ? The answer would seem to lie in two considerations : first , the continued supply of additional labor inputs , which reduced labor shortages at a cost that was still consistent with profitability ; second , the difficulty of devising technological improvements that were appropriate for tropical agriculture - an issue the World Bank is still grappling with today . Austin 's argument offers scholars who have criticized the vent-for surplus thesis - without bringing themselves to abandon it - a neat , logical way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the importance of his claim , but about precisely how much weight to place on it . His interpretation is still consistent with a degree of unemployment or underemployment during the dry season , whether on farms or in nonagricultural activities . If the opportunity cost of dry-season , nonagricultural labor was as low as Austin suggests , it would indicate that there was a reserve army awaiting opportunities that would justify the ( low ) risk and cost of taking them . There may not have been many idle hoes , but there may have been some idle hands in the nonagricultural service sector . <p> With regard to farming practices , Austin shows in fresh and convincing detail that the decisions made by Asante farmers to plant cocoa trees closely together on plots that made extensive use of available land was a far more successful strategy than the alternative advocated by the colonial government and practiced by the few European planters , namely to space trees wide apart but to use intensive methods ( which quickly ran into problems of diminishing soil fertility ) . Only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did scientific advances begin to point towards alternative agronomic methods that could be applied should land scarcity make itself felt . Austin then relates this general argument to considerations of scale . Farms varied in size . Did the production function ( the combination of factors needed to produce a given unit of output ) favor large or small holdings ? As Austin notes , this issue came to the fore in the 1970s in the debate over the " crisis of transition " in 19th-century West Africa , when it was argued that the agricultural exports favored small producers and that , in consequence , large producers ( notably ex-slave suppliers ) faced a " crisis of transition . " 19 After a careful assessment of a range of agricultural exports , Austin concludes that there were no worthwhile economies of scale in export-crop production . There were marked inequalities of farm size and income among cocoa-farmers , but these have to be explained by other causes , such as differential access to land and labor and variations in entrepreneurial performance . The Asante Economy in the 19th Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labor , and capital in the 19th century . Austin shows that land was alienated in the precolonial period , even though the general conditions were those of land abundance . He then explains this seeming paradox by refining the distinction between ownership and use rights . The former were of limited economic value because of the ready availability of land ; the latter were of great importance but for the same reason did not lead to the development of significant rental incomes or to the rise of a landlord or rentier class . This finding prompts the reflection that Marxists failed to fit Africa into a feudal system because they were never able to come to terms with the land-surplus economy . The displaced theoretical residue , the so-called " African mode of production , " was simply a recognition of the fact that African states derived far more income from trade than from land . <p> Austin then provides a detailed assessment of the types of labor employed in the Asante economy . The earlier historiography had identified rudimentary categories of slave and free labor ; Austin offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work unit was the conjugal family rather than the extended family. 20 Austin takes care to emphasize that it was the conjugal family that provided by far the greater part of the labor required in the changing 19th-century economy . This is a most important insight and it needs to be kept in mind when discussing more publicized and controversial forms of labor , notably slavery . Women dominated farming and domestic work ; men focused on wealth-generating activities such as long-distance trade and gold mining . Cooperative labor was also mobilized , but it may have been a recent adaptation to the decline of slavery and the development of new cropping systems , rather than an institution inherited from a distant , supposedly communal past. 21 Chiefs , however , enjoyed a longstanding right to call on communal work groups , though for only a limited time and defined purpose . <p> Labor on any larger scale meant recourse to market activities . It is here that Austin embarks on the most systematic and thoughtful account to date of the old and still imperfectly understood question of the forms taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the existence of " any form of hired labor by free people " in precolonial Asante is " almost non-existent " ( p. 114 ) . On the other hand , there is abundant evidence of the importance of slavery . Most slaves in Asante came from northern savanna societies and were captured , purchased , or paid in tribute . The slave market was a true market because prices resulted from the intersection of supply and demand and not from any " non-rational " considerations . Austin notes the existence of processes of assimilation , whereby slaves could acquire rights and be incorporated into the household ; at the same time , the larger numbers of slaves held by chiefs and " big men " were commonly organized in separate settlements devoted to food production . These units functioned in the manner of sharecropping - an arrangement that enabled masters to deal with supervisory problems on distant farms while still maximizing output . After 1807 , when the British withdrew from the external slave trade , slave prices rose rather than fell because demand within Asante ( and among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Asante increased as the 19th century advanced , and slave holders came to include commoners as well as chiefs . Abolition thus perpetuated slavery within Africa , and it was the growing supply of slave labor that made the expansion of the gold and kola trades possible . Slavery in Asante was not a misnomer for a benign system of apprenticeship : the lack of evidence of slave revolts should not be interpreted as being a measure of contentment ; slaves were owned , and in the last resort could be sold. 22 <p> The capital market was established long before the 19th century and was intimately connected to the labor market. 23 The time-value of money and the concept of risk were well understood ; both found expression in the rate of interest . The credit system extended from loans between members of a matrilineage or conjugal family to state loans for slave raiding . An array of legal sanctions helped to protect lenders ' rights ; pawning of property and people was a common means of offering security . Austin here offers a detailed account of pawning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , it provided a form of labor that was redeemable. 24 In his judgment , it is probable that pawning increased in the course of the 19th century and that the size of the loans attached to pawns grew , Looked at from another angle , this development can be regarded an aspect of the spread of capitalist relations through the medium of foreign trade . <p> Having identified the main components of the labor market , Austin reviews the various explanations for the existence of slavery going back to Nieboer 's seminal formulation , which has not been considered fully with respect to West Africa since the 1970s. 25 Austin 's carefully sifted evidence provides support for the classic explanation : the institution of slavery was indeed a profit-maximizing response to a land-surplus and labor-scarce economy . But Austin then elaborates the argument in ways that provide a fresh perspective on Asante and on West Africa generally . He first documents the claim that slave labor was markedly cheaper than the theoretical alternative of wage labor . Without compulsion , the cost of labor would have been such that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument to explain the prevalence of pawning . The demand for pawns ( and slaves ) was driven not only by the need to secure additional labor ( men ) but to secure the means of reproduction ( women ) . Men dominated as holders of pawns and slaves ; women were more numerous as pawns and retained slaves . This distinction arose partly because men had more opportunities for acquisition than women , but mainly because pawns and slaves gave men the chance to have more wives and children ; this was especially important in a matrilineal society that restricted fathers ' rights over their children . In these ways Austin greatly amplifies Nieboer 's original hypothesis by unraveling the heterogeneous nature of the labor market , by entering the element of political power derived from the control of forest assets ( which generated the income needed to import slaves ) , and by casting new light on recent discussions of the position of women in precolonial Africa . <p> Austin shows conclusively that there was a well established factor market in 19th-century Asante . It was an imperfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a realist might say this condition was much closer to normality than textbook descriptions of perfect competition allow . The key to economic expansion was the acquisition of labor , but opportunities for doing so were skewed . Most slaves were owned by chiefs ; commoners increased their ownership of slaves in the 19th century but generally held more pawns . Expanded supplies of slaves helped Asante adapt to the end of the external slave trade but in doing so created , or at least enhanced , economic and social differences . In this way the 19th century pointed towards the 20th because those with labor resources at their disposal were best able to take advantage of the cocoa boom . The Asante Economy under Colonial Rule <p> The remaining nine chapters ( 11-19 ) before the Conclusion ( 20 ) cover the era of colonial rule . The aim here is to follow the lines of continuity established in the 19th century while at the same time drawing attention to points of transition in the composition and combination of factors of production , <p> One of the most crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shift from slave to free labor . In 1908 the colonial government made slavery and pawning in Asante illegal . Ultimately , this was an act of lasting significance ; in the short run its consequences were less than revolutionary . In Asante , as elsewhere , slavery died a slow death. 26 Effective abolition was delayed partly by the need to maintain the wealth of the chiefs and " big men , " who were to play a part in running the new colony , and partly by the lack , at that moment , of ready-made alternative opportunities to support a social order of freed slaves . The key policy adopted by the colonial government in this respect was the decision to prevent the alienation of land to Europeans and non-Asante Africans alike . The Gold Coast did not become a settler colony ; the Asante were protected from being dispossessed by other subjects of the new colony . Most slaves came from the north and had no rights to land in Asante ; the few who left their masters shortly after abolition were mainly Akan who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , pawning , and corve labor lasted long enough to be important in the early stages of cocoa farming between 1900 and 1916. 27 As Austin shows , this meant that men of wealth played a leading role in the first wave of plantings . This story suggests that , initially at least , colonial rule was based on economic structures inherited from changes originating in the 19th century and before the partition of Africa . The position changed from the 1920s , with the rise of wage labor , but by then the Gold Coast had already become the world 's largest exporter of cocoa . <p> Existing land tenure arrangements provided a further element of continuity by offering sufficient security for the development of export crops . Had this not been the case , Austin argues , cocoa-farming would not have expanded so rapidly . Again , however , continuity was accompanied by change because the value attached to cocoa enabled chiefs to collect forest rent through the sale and leasing of exclusive use rights to land . As Austin emphasizes , the purchase of land was neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundance scarcity value attached to the capital created on the land through planting and maintaining cocoa farms . Austin here modifies the stereotype of the colonial government as an ally of conservative forces in Africa. 28 Support for the chiefs has to be seen in the context of support for ( progressive ) chiefly capitalist enterprise in cocoa farming . But support for rural capitalism was not confined to one privileged social group . The majority of cocoa farmers were non-chiefly Asante who took advantage of their free right to land and used family labor to create farm capital . The colonial authorities acted consistently to defend the property rights of all farmers over the trees and crops they had planted . This policy involved measures that restricted the chiefs ' claims to tax cocoa farms and even to allocate use rights . Eventually , too , the chiefs lost the use of slave and corve labor . All the same , their connection to the colonial regime and the economy it presided over remained strong , if also tense. 29 The chiefs were well placed not only to cash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also to attract a new labor force in the 1920s and ' 30s . By the 1940s some of them had even managed to convert stool lands to private holdings . If one conclusion of this rich investigation has to be that the demise of the chiefs can easily be exaggerated , another is that the rise of enterprising free commoners must also be given full weight . <p> The expansion of cocoa farming brought an effective end to slavery by increasing the rent from forest land and making it both profitable and necessary to hire labor . Put another way , earnings from cocoa enabled farmers to pay wages. 30 Wage laborers emerged after the formal abolition of slavery and pawning in 1908 first as porters and then , from the 1920s , as farm workers . Most laborers came from the north on regular contracts and supplemented rather than replaced family labor , though some Asantes , often young men , also became farm laborers , despite the availability of land , while they were waiting a return from their plantings . Here , Austin makes a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor force . He shows that wage labor was a halting development that was overtaken by sharecropping from the 1930s . Migrating laborers from the northern states had considerable bargaining power , which they used to engineer a shift from annual wage contracts to managerial sharecropping . Far from being an aberrant reversion to a precapitalist or transitional stage of labor use , sharecropping had marked advantages for farm workers ; unlike wage labor , it offered freedom from supervision and a guarantee that work completed would be paid . This is why sharecropping became more important than wage labor on cocoa farms in Asante - and remained so for the rest of the colonial period . <p> Cocoa fanning was dominated by men . The division of labor between the sexes was not redrawn in the colonial period . The fact that opportunities for women remained limited helps to explain why they continued to be offered as pawns . But women were far from being passive : they appear to have taken over the trade in foodstuffs in the 1920s and ' 30s , when men shifted into cocoa farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonial period advanced. 31 The conjugal unit remained a more important source of labor than the matrilineage , as it had been in the 19th century . Austin 's evidence suggests that matrilineal inheritance survived the development of cocoa farming but had come under great strain by the end of the colonial period , by which time it had become a source of considerable social conflict. 32 If there was a golden age for women in precolonial Asante it has yet to be revealed ; the colonial era did not transform their situation but does seem to have ameliorated it . By 1957 , when Ghana gained independence , women had managed to create new opportunities for themselves despite indifference and even hostility among the males who still had their hands on the levers of power. 33 <p> Cocoa farming also had a powerful effect on the development of the capital market . Farmers could now borrow on the security of their cocoa crop , present and future , instead of pawning relatives . By the 1940s the transition from pledging people to pledging land was well under way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place . Austin dissects this new capital market with great precision . His investigation of mortgage contracts shows that they mostly took the form of pledges rather than charges , that rates were not excessive , and that most borrowers wanted loans to finance consumption rather than production . A second feature of the new capital market was the growth of seasonal advances for the forward-purchases of the cocoa crop . An older historiography , made authoritative by Bauer , 34 held that most advances were provided by European firms and were necessary to harvest and transport the season 's cocoa crop . Austin shows definitively that this was not the case . European capital only made an appearance after cocoa exports had become established ; even so , African farmers remained important providers of advances throughout the colonial period . More important still , advances were driven by supply , not by demand : buying firms offered advances when cocoa prices were high so that they could outbid their competitors . When competition was reduced , so were advances . In a neat extension of his analysis , Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural economy was provided by the suppliers of labor themselves . Sharecroppers received a return only after the crop had been sold - after six months ' work ; laborers usually had to wait for their wages , without a guarantee that they would be forthcoming . <p> Clearly the cocoa economy of Asante was awash with credit . Indebtedness grew as the colonial period advanced ; so did the concern of colonial authorities , who feared that the outcome would be the creation of a landless and politically disaffected rural underclass . Africa , however , was not India . The safety valve provided by the availability of land remained , and extensive cultivation continued to be an efficient outlet for small-scale enterprise throughout the colonial era . Making a History of Poverty <p> In the first instance , Labour , Land , and Capital in Ghana is a contribution to the history of Ghana 's most important export industry . It is also the only full study of the introduction of cocoa into Asante . As such , it does more than " fill a gap " : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of Wilks and McCaskie on political and social history . The only comparable research on cocoa farming in Ghana - Polly Hill 's pioneering study 35 - dealt with incoming strangers who acquired land by purchase in Akyem in the 1890s . Hill 's central point about the dynamism of indigenous entrepreneurs and institutions remains untouched and is underlined by Austin 's own account . But Hill 's story was exceptional in a number of respects and was not representative of the far larger development that took place subsequently in Asante . Austin 's meticulous study now provides a much firmer foundation for generalizations about the economic history of the industry . The great majority of cocoa farmers in Asante were not incoming migrants but local men ; land was made available to strangers on usufruct terms and not by sale ; slaves and pawns were important in Asante but not , it seems , in Akyem ; matrilineage was weakened but not destroyed ; large farmers dominated the market for credit in Asante far more than in Akyem ; debt was created within the farming community and enabled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing inequalities in rural society . It is worth underlining some of the differences between the two cases here because Austin deals with them in a dispersed and low-key way in Labour , Land , and Capital and , in doing so , risks underselling his own very significant contribution. 36 <p> Austin 's study also has a contribution to make well beyond Asante and Ghana . The problems he tackles and the solutions he advocates have a direct relevance for all students of tropical Africa and , more broadly , for an understanding of economic development in what used to be called the Third World . To be sure , there is a case to be made for Asante " exceptionalism , " and Austin is too respectful of the individuality of other parts of Africa , let alone other parts of the world , to make excessive claims for his work . Yet there is also a case for saying that Asante has too often been treated as being exceptional by those immersed in its exceptional source materials , and it ought to be apparent by now that Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , which is why they deserve the space allotted to them here . To summarize : Austin offers a fresh account of the development of capitalist relations in markets for land , labor , and capital . He has made major contributions to our understanding of land rights and use rights , slavery , pawning , pledging , wage labor , sharecropping , gender , mortgages , and advances . He has tied these themes together in an assessment of the process of export growth that greatly improves on the vent-for-surplus thesis and points towards a more detailed application of staple theory. 37 Moreover , by spanning both precolonial and colonial periods Austin has been able to identify change within continuities by means that are both subtle and clear . <p> Austin 's findings contain lessons for Bob Geldof and the World Bank too . His view of theory is both informed and eclectic . There are no simple solutions to a complex world , however much we crave them . If we begin by " getting prices right , " we soon rediscover the need to " bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional capital ( or any other single factor ) will work wonders , we rapidly come up against institutional and political barriers to our master plan and good intentions. 38 Much of Austin 's study could be considered as an essay in long-term " structural adjustment " in which different combinations of private enterprise and public provision produced considerable export growth during both precolonial and colonial eras . At one level , this is a story of the evolution of capitalism ; at another it reminds us that capitalism takes many shapes and follows different paths . The Asante example shows that capitalism does not invariably preserve precapitalist forms in peripheral economies . Property rights affect outcomes not only through pecuniary incentives but through their effect on the distribution of power. 39 Wage labor is not a natural , approved stage in the march towards modernization . Sharecropping is neither a backward nor a transitional form of labor mobilization . " Peasants " do not always become trapped between employers and proletarians ; rural laborers are not inevitably separated from property . Pledging does not necessarily condemn farmers to poverty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a less dramatic means of development than a highly visible " great leap forward , " whether private or public , but it may well be more effective . Like it or not , the colonial regime was not entirely conservative in seeking to preserve older paternalistic relationships ; if the " legacy of colonialism " is then related to what is now a considerable period of independence , 40 it is only a short step to connecting it to policy formulation. 41 For the present , we might conclude that development policy is better guided by history than by ideology . <p> As I complete this essay , reports are coming in of another " sudden " crisis in Africa , this time brought by drought in Niger . Historians can not solve this crisis or similar crises , but they can contribute usefully to the fund of knowledge that informs both public opinion and the formulation of development policy . The significance of Austin 's contribution , beyond the realm of Asante studies , is that it reminds us that historians have a role in this regard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side in recent years . His dedicated labor has resulted in a major achievement , and one well worth waiting for . It is hard to see anyone trying to revise this work , apart from the author : others might have written it differently ; others still might take it in different directions in the future ; but what has been done could scarcely be have been done more thoroughly or to better effect . If there were more books like this we would all have to read a lot less and think a good deal more . This being so , the final thought should go to Toyin Falola and his enterprising Rochester Studies in African History and the Diaspora without whose support this large manuscript might not have seen the light of day . <p>
