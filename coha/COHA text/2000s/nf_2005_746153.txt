Discussion of " traditional values " has been prominent not only in political slogans and speeches but some polls indicate that they are an important concern for a significant segment of the electorate as well . Yet as a university professor who has researched and written in this area , I have become disturbed ( and alarmed ) by the way value terms are employed in public discourse . Discussions have often been confusing , misdirected , and skewed for partisan advantage . And , for the most part , those using the rhetoric of traditional values have totally missed the point of how a very special set of values developed as an integral part of the great experiment called the United States of America . Therefore , we need to take a historical look at the values that have served as the goals for America 's evolving society and ask three important questions : what are these values , from whence did they come , and how well have we lived up to them ? <p> Over the centuries a number of foreign visitors have traveled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various walks of life , and studied American social-political institutions . The observations and conclusions of these travelers are available today in published essays and books . Their writings provide us with interesting insights about what the United States is all about and what being an " American " is like . Also , in hearing and reading what citizens say and observing what citizens do , they are able to peel away the veneer and make explicit the values and value conflicts inherent in the American experiment . <p> Hector St. John Crevecoeur was born in France in 1735 and died there in 1813 . During his life he traveled in the Great Lakes area , the Ohio valley , and Pennsylvania . He farmed for awhile in Orange County , New York , and served as French consul in New York City . In 1782 he wrote Letters from an American Farmer , which provides an excellent description of rural life on the eve of the American Revolution . He is perhaps the first writer to note that America had become a " melting pot " of many cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to be an American : <p> What then is the American , this new man ? . He is an American , who , leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners , receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced , the new government he obeys , the new rank he holds . Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men , whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world .. The American is a new man , who acts upon new principles ; he must therefore entertain new ideas , and form new opinions . <p> The most celebrated foreign traveler to the United States , however , was Alexis de Tocqueville . He was born in Paris in 1805 into a family that was supportive of the French aristocracy . As an adult he grew increasingly skeptical of the role of the aristocracy in politics and came to think of the United States as a political model for French democracy . In 1831 he and a friend visited the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as New Orleans , and spending time in New York , Boston , and Philadelphia . His impressions of the country were published in 1835 under the title , Democracy in America ( a second volume followed in 1840 ) . Some have called it " the most insightful book ever written about the United States . " Here are a few sample quotations : <p> Americans of all ages , all stations of life , and all types of dispositions are forever forming associations . In democratic countries knowledge of how to combine is the mother of all other forms of knowledge .. <p> There are many men of principle in both parties in America , but there is no party of principle .. <p> In no other country in the world is the love of property keener or more alert than in the United States , and nowhere else does the majority display less inclination toward doctrines which in any way threaten the way property is owned . . <p> Two things in America are astonishing : the changeableness of most human behavior and the strange stability of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the spirit of humanity seems almost unmoved . <p> From these brief quotations , certain American characteristics and values seem to emerge . One can sense that Crevecoeur and de Tocqueville detected a unique combination of attributes  --  something quite different from the Europe of their day . But it would be up to a twentieth-century Swedish economist and sociologist to pull all the " impressions " together and initiate a serious study of the American character and system of values . <p> Gunnar Myrdal was born in Sweden in 1898 and became a world renowned economist . He was awarded a Nobel Prize in economics in 1974 . In 1938 the Carnegie Corporation of New York commissioned him to direct a study of the United States ' Negro problem . The material that he collected and interpreted was published in 1944 as An American Dilemma : The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy . Although the study 's focus was on the race problem , in order to thoroughly explore it ( and offer solutions ) he had to examine the nation 's value structure . <p> In analyzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constellation of general values ( or normative concepts ) which they termed the American Creed . To Myrdal , this " creed " represented the National Conscience . These values can be viewed as the fundamental ideals of the nation  --  ideals to which all citizens can reasonably be expected to be committed . They constitute the basic standards that can be employed in describing , debating , and evaluating national issues and problems . They include concepts such as the following : <p> ? Property rights <p> ? Free speech <p> ? Freedom of religion <p> ? Freedom of personal association <p> ? Right to privacy <p> ? Rejection of violence <p> ? Faith in reason as a method of dealing with conflict <p> ? General welfare of all <p> ? Equal opportunity <p> ? Equal protection under the law <p> ? Rule of law ( constitutional limits on government ) <p> ? Rule by consent of the governed <p> ? Due process of law <p> ? Separation of powers ( political ) <p> ? Local control of local problems <p> The ideological roots of the American creed are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eighteenth centuries  --  John Locke , Jean-Jacques Rousseau , Baron de Montesquieu , and others  --  in the tenets of the Judeo-Christian tradition , and in English law . In the United States the creed is reflected in a number of political and legal documents that describe the ethical basis of American society and government . These include the Declaration of Independence , the Preamble to the U. S. Constitution , and the constitution 's first ten amendments , constituting the Bill of Rights . <p> Hence , the American creed ( or conscience ) might be viewed as an overarching value umbrella that can be employed in analyzing and making decisions regarding controversial public policies . In the process , the creed values , which have citizen support , have to be translated into specific policy decisions where there is likely to be disagreement . The task then is to measure or judge public policy proposals against the standard of the creed . Myrdal had this to say about the judgmental process : <p> A need will be felt by the person or group , whose inconsistencies in valuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inconsistencies .. most persons want to present to their fellows  --  and to themselves  --  a trimmed and polished sphere of valuations , where honesty , logic , and consistency rule . <p> Thus , since most people want or appear to be consistent and logical in their valuations , they will eventually , after some foot-dragging and denial , adjust or change their valuations in a direction that is consistent with the generally accepted American creed . This is precisely what Myrdal and his associates thought would happen with regard to the race problem in the United States  --  a gradual evolutionary process moving race relations toward consistency with the creed 's tenets . <p> In the 1960s , in the midst of the civil rights movement , a team of educational scholars proposed an amendment to the Myrdal American creed formulation . Donald Oliver and James Shaver noted , in Teaching Public Issues in the High School , that Myrdal had n't accounted for the possibility of conflicts between creed values when applied to practical situations  --  such as when one person 's use of his or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to privacy or when one person 's free speech is restricted because it is likely to incite others to acts of violence . <p> Oliver and Shaver realized that conflicts between the values in the creed would arise and could be resolved only if all of the values were viewed as logically related to a " higher " value , namely , human dignity . Thus they posited human dignity as the ultimate value and considered the values of Myrdal 's creed as both defining characteristics of and instrumental to this human dignity . To quote from their 1966 report , Teaching Public Issues in the High School : <p> The multiplicity of purposes in American society can be summarized in one very abstract phrase : to promote the dignity and worth of each individual who lives in that society .. it is not likely to be disputed at least as an ideal , even though it presents some problems in translation and practice . <p> So now we have a hierarchy of American values . At the very top is human dignity and below that is the overarching umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multitude of individual and group values ( which may or may not be consistent with each other and may or may not be consistent with the higher general values ) . <p> Over the years , Americans have gradually overcome many practices that were glaringly inconsistent with the values of the American creed . But it has n't been easy for citizens to live up to the professed high ideals . Progress has been slow at times but , on occasion , seems to leap ahead with zest . The United States is probably best described as a work in progress . The historical examples that follow illustrate how Americans have struggled with themselves over a number of value-related issues . <p> ? In the early years of the republic , after much heated argument , the vote was finally extended to those who did n't own property . <p> ? During the nineteenth century free public education was gradually provided to more and more children . <p> ? The abolitionist movement advocated freeing the slaves , but it took a Civil War and an amendment to the U.S. Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Address includes a number of statements that relate to the American creed . ) <p> ? Ever so gradually the general citizenry came to accept Native Americans as human beings worthy of the fruits of a free society . <p> ? In 1920 , after a long , bitter struggle , women were finally allowed to vote throughout the United States . <p> ? Again and again we have had difficulty accepting various immigrant groups into mainstream American society . <p> ? The Progressive movement of the early twentieth century championed legislation to improve factory work conditions and limit child labor . <p> ? New Deal-era legislation offered assistance to the unemployed and the poor through the Works Progress Administration and other programs . <p> ? The civil rights movement of the 1960s resulted in legislation designed to grant full rights of citizenship to black Americans . ( Read Martin Luther King 's " I have a dream " speech of 1963 and note how his " dreams " correspond to the ideals of the American creed . ) <p> ? In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries , homosexuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ? Since the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision in 1973 the country has been polarized over the question of the legal status of the human fetus . <p> A close examination of the examples cited above reveals that historically U.S. citizens have had a problem in determining just who is eligible for the level of human dignity described in the American creed . Other than the original white male property owners , who else should be included ? The struggle continues to this day . <p> In thinking about American values , it is important not to confuse the ideal with reality . The ideals of the American creed can be thought of as societal goals , whereas the social reality is what has been accomplished and the continuing struggle to more fully realize the goals . The very essence of what America means is contained in these goals and this struggle  --  these are America 's traditional values and its conscience as a nation . This experience can certainly be an instructive model for other peoples throughout the world . <p> Whether we are thinking of Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt , Ronald Reagan , Bill Clinton , or a Bush  --  they all speak the language of the American Creed . They just have diverse ways of going about fulfilling its promise . <p> By Charles E. Gray <p> <p> Charles E.
