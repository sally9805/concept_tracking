<p> WASHINGTON  --  Pardon the interruption , but have you noticed the airwaves are teeming with sports columnists these days ? Oscar Madison was once the disheveled archetype of the typing set . Now , somehow , columnists are . . . cool ? <p> " Hey , " says Tony Kornheiser , grinning like the Cheshire cat , " it 's hip to be square . " <p> Kornheiser should know . He is a prime example of a national trend . Sports columnists have radio shows in local markets across the land these days . Most keep their day jobs . Kornheiser does , too , if only nominally . He writes his column for The Washington Post once a week and is on air most days . <p> Kornheiser has emerged as the leading sports yakker in Talk Nation : His three-hour ESPN radio show runs on 235 affiliates nationwide . Pardon the Interruption , his half-hour gabfest with fellow Post sports columnist and sparring partner Michael Wilbon , airs at 5:30 p.m . ET weekdays and is rerun often . The show premiered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around the Horn , which premiered a year later as a lead-in to PTI . <p> Around the Horn marries game show with talk show and features four sports columnists each day from newspapers such as The Boston Globe , Denver Post , Chicago Sun-Times , Dallas Morning News and Los Angeles Times . Its ratings are up 36% over the show it replaced , Unscripted , which was an interview show with , um , actual athletes . PTI 's are up 97% over Up Close , also a chat-with-jocks interview show . <p> Have we really reached a point where sports fans would sooner listen to people who write about games than those who play them ? <p> " All of a sudden , if you 're an old sportswriter , everyone wants to hear from you , " Kornheiser says . " Which worked out well for me , because now I 'm an old sportswriter . " <p> Kornheiser rarely talks to athletes on his radio show . His regular stable of guests includes mainly writers  --  an Algonquin Round Table of columnists , critics and reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton elected president , picks football games . <p> " The three pillars of my life , " Carville deadpanned after November 's Republican romp , " have been the Roman Catholic Church , LSU football and the Democratic Party . " <p> Kornheiser guffaws . See , this is what he likes . If you want **35;631;TOOLONG talk , listen elsewhere . His formula is simple : Kornheiser talks to the people who make him laugh or think . He interviews smart former athletes such as Joe Morgan and Ron Jaworski but rarely anyone who still sweats for a living . <p> " I do n't want ' em . They 're idiots , " he says . " They 're not all idiots , but most of them are young and see the world in a limited way revolving strictly around their craft . It does n't help this show to have an athlete come in for name recognition and bore me out of my socks . . . . I 'd rather do a show with sportswriters . It 's more entertaining to me . " <p> Kornheiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days , too . <p> " Sportswriters are more accustomed to being forthcoming about topics , " says John Walsh , executive editor at ESPN . " Sometimes observers see things better than the participants . " <p> Andy Pollin , a Kornheiser sidekick who has spent his working life in radio , thinks crossover columnists are a natural evolution : " Writers , especially columnists , are used to organizing their thoughts . Their minds are trained to make an outline of what they 're going to say . So they can do this . " <p> Walsh 's point is that writers know how to observe . Pollin 's point is that they know how to think . Wilbon figures it 's simpler than that . " Writers love to argue . And we 're good at it . " <p> Oscar and Felix <p> Wilbon , 44 , and Kornheiser , 52 , are The Odd Couple : Mike as cigar-chomping sportswriter Oscar Madison and Tony as fastidious neurotic Felix Unger . <p> " Ask any 15 people who know us : It 's perfect casting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maniac and that 's Tony , down to the note-taking and getting up at 4:30 because he ca n't sleep . He says he 's walking the dog , but he 's probably dusting . I 'm not messy like Oscar , and I love clothes too much to dress badly , but the rest probably applies . " <p> Kornheiser concurs . Wilbon gets to be Oscar because he lives in press boxes . And Kornheiser is Felix " because I 'm anal-retentive , a bundle of nerves and , really , I ca n't imagine not being Felix . " <p> Erik Rydholm , producer of Pardon the Interruption , says he had the notion of two other old TV shows in mind when he created PTI . The first was Siskel &; Ebert , also based on taking newspaper writers  --  in this case movie critics  --  and letting them argue in front of a camera . The other was Sonny and Cher . <p> " You had a sense when you watched Sonny and Cher bicker back and forth that the relationship was real and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rydholm says . " That 's Tony and Mike . They argue , but underneath you can see that they really like each other . " <p> That 's the trick . PTI is not really a sports show ; it 's a relationship show . <p> " Wilbon and I have been doing this for 20 years in a hallway , " Kornheiser says . " I love Wilbon . I mean , who would n't love Wilbon ? He 's Mayor McCheese . You have to really love the other person  --  and at that point you can yell at the other person . . . . He 'll call me a New York idiot and I 'll call him a fat dope and it 's OK . " <p> The result is Crossfire with cross-dressing  --  or what Kornheiser calls an amalgam of Meet the Press and The Gong Show . Topics are covered in 90 seconds or ( usually ) less . The interview segment is five minutes . <p> " Role Play , " a frequent segment , finds Wilbon and Kornheiser using heads on sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads in turn end up as festive background on the set , lending an ambience of dorm-room chic . Tony Reali ( better known as Stat Boy ) offers corrections near the end  --  a print impulse rarely found on TV . <p> " Erik created all of these bells and whistles for us , " Kornheiser says . " I am not falsely modest on any level , and I 'm sure we do a really good job , but he gave us the fastest car in the race . " <p> Rydholm insists chemistry trumps format . Fair enough . But if Mike is Oscar and Tony is Felix , who 's Sonny  --  and who 's Cher ? " Tony wears the turbans , " Rydholm says . " You figure it out . " <p> ' Talent poodles ' <p> Television has borrowed from print since its inception , although it hired many of its early sports broadcasters from radio . Sportswriters mostly stayed on the page . That 's the world Kornheiser and Wilbon grew up in . <p> " The people in TV made more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were smarter and they envied them their dedication and their craft , " Kornheiser says . " Whereas we in sportswriting always envied them their hair and their money  --  and actually resented them enormously . We thought they were talent poodles . <p> " Now , if I had hair , I 'd be a talent poodle . Because it 's our turn . We 're all doin ' it , every sports columnist in America . " <p> Walsh says the advent of cable TV jump-started the crossover . Many of ESPN 's editorial executives , including him , came from print . They in turn hired on-air beat reporters such as Peter Gammons ( The Boston Globe ) and David Aldridge ( The Washington Post ) . Columnists would come later . <p> In the 1970s , when Rydholm was growing up in Chicago , he liked a weekly show on local TV where sportswriters argued in a smoke-filled room . <p> Kornheiser never saw that show but he heard about it when he was called to do a pilot for The Sports Reporters in the late 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday mornings , and Kornheiser and Wilbon are among its rotation of guests . Now Sports Reporters II has been added on Tuesday nights . And PTI has spawned Around the Horn . <p> Max Kellerman , ESPN 's boxing analyst , hosts ATH , which bills itself as " competitive banter . " Kellerman broaches topics and the columnists give opinions while Kellerman awards style points based on their arguments . <p> Critics have been generous to PTI but less so to ATH . Regulars include respected columnists such as The Boston Globe 's Bob Ryan ( " the quintessential American sportswriter , " as Kornheiser introduces him on the radio ) , but ATH is so concept-driven that it can be hard to watch . It has a rating of 0.38 , which translates to 330,000 households . PTI has a rating of 0.69 , or 600,000 households . Its rating for men 18-34 is 1.01  --  which pleases and surprises its hosts . <p> " They tell me we 're a hit on college campuses , " Kornheiser says . " Why , I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I hear that college kids say , ' It 's just like watching our parents argue . ' Maybe that 's it . " <p> Or maybe it 's that Sonny-and-Cher simpatico . You ca n't fake chemistry . The only way to act like friends of 20 years is to be friends for 20 years . <p> " It 's that old story of how they got the grass at Wimbledon to be so great , " Kornheiser says . " First you start with 5,000 years of rain . "
