THE HOLLYWOOD PARTY Shane Scully sure did n't want to go to this Hollywood party . It was way the hell out in Malibu , and except for Nora Bishop , he and his wife , Alexa , were n't going to know anybody there . The party was to announce Nora 's engagement to a movie producer named Farrell Champion , whom neither of them had met . Making it even worse , Shane and Alexa were cops and would probably stand out like psychiatrists at a Star Trek convention . They did n't understand movie people or Hollywood , with its strange language and customs . So Shane was more or less dreading it . Alexa , on the other hand , could barely contain her excitement . She had spent at least two hours getting ready , which to tell the truth kind of pissed him off . One of the things he prized most about his beautiful black-haired wife was that she never made a big deal out of her appearance . She could show up most places wearing a horse blanket and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dithered and fussed until it had made them hopelessly late . " You think these earrings are too gaudy ? You think this blue-and-red scarf is too much with the tan skirt ... ? " " No , looks great ... love it ... " But it did n't matter what he thought , because she would just wrinkle her nose and stare at the clothing on the bed , then pull out a new ensemble . Shane had dressed quickly , showering and combing his short black hair with his fingers . He glanced at his rugged angular face in the mirror . He was in his late thirties and his bony cheeks and hard , deep-set eyes reminded him of an over-the-hill , beat-up street fighter . It always surprised him when someone described him as handsome . At least , he marveled , he 'd been lucky enough to jump the many hurdles required to marry the most beautiful woman on the LAPD . They finally got in his Acura at five-thirty , left Venice , California , and headed toward Malibu . They were almost an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Malibu Pier . Shane drove while Alexa chattered nervously . " That last guy Nora dated , remember him , Shane ? The one who traded futures on the stock exchange ? " " Yeah . Bill something , with the dimple in his chin ... " " That fucking dimple was a surgical add-on , " Alexa growled . " Boy , was I glad when Nora gave him the old flusheroo . " " Yep . Bill was sleaze . " " And remember Paul Bennett ? Remember him ? How on earth Nora ever decided to get entangled with Paul Bennett , with his polo ponies , which everyone thought he owned but it turned out he just rented , and the rented Ferrari ... he should 've rented a personality . " " Yeah , Paul was definitely toe-jam . A skunk . " She turned and looked at him . " Are you humoring me , buddy ? " She smiled . " I agree Nora 's been flying in a bug storm , but we do n't know anything about this new guy either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's in almost every national magazine . " " Whatta you mean we do n't know ? I 've been talking to Nora about Farrell Champion since she started to decorate his Malibu house last year . He 's the real deal-A-list all the way-and she 's so happy , Shane . At last I think she 's found Mr. Right . " " Yep , yep ... pretty exciting . " God , he was dreading this party . When they passed the Serra Retreat , the former mansion of the woman who once owned twenty miles of California coastline , Shane slowed the Acura and picked up the expensive invitation . It had a slightly corny Hollywood theme . On the top of the embossed card it said : " It 's a Wrap on Farrell 's Bachelorhood . " There were some old-fashioned drawings of 35mm movie cameras , underscored by the inscription : " Come Help Us Celebrate Farrell 's Biggest Epic Yet ... It 's a Love Story . " He flipped it open to the map that showed where Farrell Champion 's house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate being late . Maybe we should just call in sick , " he suggested , grinning . " Nothing doing , you coward . Besides , I want to see the stars . I hear Julia Roberts is going to be there . Farrell produced one of her movies last year , and Nora said even Robert Downey , Jr . " " Shit , and us without our drug kits . " She punched him . " Stop it . " She smiled . " You 're gon na love it . " Seconds later they turned off the Coast Highway into the Colony . They pulled up to the guard , who frowned at the unwashed Acura . Then came the ritual giving and checking of names , the showing of the invitation . They were validated . A short drive down into the Malibu Colony and they were handing the dusty Acura over to a valet with surfer-blond hair wearing a red coat with gold buttons . It fit him better than Shane 's blue blazer . Another valet was just driving a white Bentley away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few tardy arrivals lined up at the front door . " See , we 're not that late , " Alexa said as she and Shane headed up the stone walkway . Farrell Champion had built a French Provincial on two oceanfront lots . The house was grotesquely large , dwarfing its neighbors , and Shane thought it seemed pretentious and out of place , only forty yards from the crashing surf . They got in line behind a beautiful woman who was wearing a beaded dress , very low cut , and an older gentleman with silver hair in a tuxedo with a black silk shirt-they looked like Bentley owners . " We 're underdressed , " Alexa hissed in his ear as she looked at the woman 's evening gown . Alexa had ended up wearing a white pantsuit with a wide belt and sandals . She looked gorgeous . Her blue eyes and sculpted face dominated a slender , athletic body . Shane whispered back , " How can you underdress for a beach barbecue ? " The couple in front stepped over the threshold and Shane could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by Nora Bishop 's tinkling laugh . " Boris . " Farrell 's baritone . " Great opening weekend grosses on Horizon of the Damned . You 're up five percent prorated from holiday weekend totals last year . " " But the P and A sure set us back a bundle , " the tuxedoed man replied . " It 's a step release . We 're going wide next week ... twenty-six hundred screens . " " Thelma , you look devastating , as always .... " Farrell again . " Sorry about being so overdressed , Farrell . We 're leaving here for Calvin 's opening at the Taper . " Shane heard Alexa let out a sigh . After a few air kisses , Thelma and Boris moved on . Alexa was holding Shane 's hand and she gave it a little hopeful squeeze . It was their turn . Show time . They stepped into the magnificent , antiques-laden entry hall and Shane hugged Nora . She was a beautiful , dark-haired , forty-five-year-old woman with a sweet , tender quality that always made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of L.A. 's premiere interior decorators . In the last few years , Bishop Interiors had done a lot of the big homes in Beverly Hills , Malibu , and the Palisades . And despite her exposure to some of L.A. 's most demanding A-type personalities , Nora never provoked any discontent . She had a way of getting you to behave by making you feel good about yourself . She was ten years older than Alexa , and had been Alexa 's babysitter back in Michigan when she was twelve . That was the year after Alexa 's mother had died . Shane had always wondered if Nora 's move to L.A. foreshadowed his wife 's decision to come West as well , as if she needed to be close to Nora , who was like a big sister or maybe even a surrogate mother . Alexa usually projected strength and determination , but around Nora she became strangely girlish . With Nora , she giggled . Sometimes , as Shane watched them together , he would get a glimpse of what his wife must have been like as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coming . You 're the best . " Nora flashed her irresistible smile , then hugged Alexa . " I love that outfit , where did you get it ? " " This ? It was on sale at May Company . " Alexa wrinkled her nose in apology . " It 's just an Adrienne Vittadini copy . " " On you it looks like a Dior original . " Nora turned to the handsome fifty-five-year-old man beside her . " You guys have n't met Farrell . Farrell , these are my dearest friends in L.A. , the Scullys . " Farrell grinned , and they shook hands and all started frantically searching for common ground . " Nora , you did n't tell me Alexa would be so sexy . This is no meter maid you 've got here , Shane . " Nine out of ten guys who said something like that would have pissed Shane off . Not that he was overly jealous , but there was some primal piece of him that did n't like handsome guys fawning over his wife or calling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Farrell 's demeanor said " Just kidding , do n't take this the wrong way . " He had a personality ... Shane hated the word , but okay , a vibe that was warm , engaging , and funny . In seconds , Shane could feel himself being won over . Furthermore , Farrell Champion was extremely attractive and his looks drew you to him . He was fit , but not musclebound , not a fanatic . His silver-gray hair was swept back off his tanned forehead and his dark eyes looked right at you , focusing , making you feel important . " What a beautiful house .... It 's refreshing to see this kind of architecture on the beach . " Shane could n't believe such an egregiously phony sentence had come gushing out of him . " Making movies is n't brain surgery , Shane . You got ta take all of this with a grain of salt , " Farrell whispered with a wink . " No matter what anybody tells you , show business is n't creative art , it 's a racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nora said , throwing her hand out for Alexa 's examination . The diamond was huge-over six carats . " My God , Nora , you must need someone to carry your hand around for you . " Farrell grinned . " Listen , you guys , I think everyone 's here now , so I can stop standing in the entry like a nervous doorman . Come on in . Shane , can I get you and Alexa something ? How about some white wine , or I have mixed drinks . " " Alexa likes chardonnay , I 'll take scotch , " Shane said . Farrell steered Nora and Alexa into the plush living room full of beautiful people , then left them staring at the high-profile crowd while he headed toward the bar . Alexa grabbed Nora 's hand and squeezed it . " My God , Nora ... he 's gorgeous . " " Not bad , huh ? " Nora grinned back . " After all those foul tips , I finally got some wood on the ball . " Shane nodded and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't think of a damn thing to say . He had come here fully prepared to hate Farrell Champion ... hate him for his fame and success , his wealth and connections ; hate him just for having a name like Farrell Champion . But in forty-five seconds or less , while standing in the doorway , Farrell had completely rewired all those feelings , leaving Shane groping for a new take . Shane 's eyes were sweeping the party . Everybody who was anybody in L.A. was there . He spotted faces he had only seen in People magazine . " There 's Kobe Bryant , " he whispered , seeing the Lakers ' great only a few feet away talking to ex-Mayor Riordan . Then Farrell was back , handing out drinks . " Alexa , you had chardonnay ... Shane , scotch rocks-that 's Dewar 's , hope you like it ... Nora , here 's your Campari and soda . " Then Farrell took them both by the arm and steered them through the room . " Come on , let me introduce you to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrity tour of L.A. " Nicole Kidman , this is Nora 's dear friend Alexa Scully and her husband , Shane . " The beautiful Australian actress smiled warmly , shook their hands , and they exchanged a few remarks . Then Farrell moved them on . " And this is L.A. 's resident bad boy , Jack the Mack ... Jacko , want you to meet some friends of Nora 's ... " Jack fucking Nicholson , Shane thought , feeling starstruck as he shook the famous actor 's hand . More small talk until Farrell carried them along .... " Barbra and Jim live just down the street . Meet Nora 's dear friends , Shane and Alexa . " It was Streisand and Brolin . It went on like that until finally Alexa got pulled away by Nora to meet some of the other bridesmaids , and Shane had to go to the bathroom . He used the one in the hall , thinking he was having a great time in spite of himself . This was one pretty amazing party . When Shane came out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever expected to find at Farrell Champion 's house . Chapter Two THE BAD JOKE Nicky marcella was waiting to get into the guest john as Shane exited . They looked at each other like competing art thieves casing a Sotheby 's auction . " My God , Shane Scully , " Nicky said . He was wearing a beautifully tailored , if somewhat gaudy , orangish-brown suit-or was it brownish-orange ? - hard to tell because the colors strobed when he moved . Either way , it took some doing to pull off . Maybe the suit was helped by the fact that there was n't all that much of it-Nicky being only five-foot-five , top to bottom , including his stacked Cuban heels . He was also rail thin-Mick Jagger thin . He had black hair , close-cut on the sides and slightly longer on the top . He was wearing an open-collared silk shirt with a few too many gold chains . His smile was warm , but he was narrow-faced and strangely ferretlike . " Nicky , how you been ? " " Staying outta jail , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it , " Shane said , and he was . He had n't seen Marcella in four years . Nicky was a Hollywood character . When Shane met him he was doing street-corner cons-green-goods hustles and pigeon drops . Shane had first busted him when he was still a rookie working vice in Hollywood . He 'd rolled him up twice more in the Valley when he was riding around in a plain Jane doing a straight eight in uniform . Sometime in the mid-nineties Nicky had switched from short cons to running bets for bookmakers , then had taken a short fall and ended up doing a bullet in County . When he got out , he moved on to straight-up bookmaking , writing betting slips out of a porn shop on Little Melrose . Nicky Marcella had dabbled in the criminal arts for almost the whole fifteen years Shane had known him , and now here he was , in Farrell Champion 's house , rubbing shoulders with Hollywood 's elite . " Whatta you up to ? Or should I just count the silver ? " Shane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shane . But I 'm clean as the Board of Health these days . Just a minute , do n't go away , got ta tap a kidney . " Nicky pushed past him into the bathroom while Shane stood outside wondering what on earth Nicky Marcella was doing at this party full of heavy-lifters . Even so , Shane had to admit that , over the years , he 'd come to enjoy the guy . Nicky had an infectious personality and never took himself too seriously . Of course , he was shamefully easy to arrest , a wonderful quality in a criminal . Continues ...
