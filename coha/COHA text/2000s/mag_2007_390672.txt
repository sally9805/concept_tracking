This fall , when students at Penn State-Altoona trudge back to their dorms demoralized by a failed test or a romance on the rocks , they can take advantage of free mental-health counseling , on the spot , from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m . Monday through Thursday . At Cornell University , where foreign students tend to avoid the campus counseling center , a counselor now staffs an outpost in the international dorm so the isolated and struggling can drop in for an impromptu chat . All students who come to the health center at the University of Wisconsin , even if just for a sprained ankle or a case of the sniffles , soon will be automatically screened for depression and offered treatment if needed . Galvanized by the April tragedy at Virginia Tech , in which Seung Hui Cho killed 32 students and faculty members and then committed suicide , colleges and universities around the country are urgently taking stock of the reach and effectiveness of their mental-health services . The goal is not just to avoid another catastrophe caused by a deeply troubled student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face up to the needs of today 's students , who increasingly struggle with eating disorders , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and depression . The rate of depression among college students has doubled in just 15 years ; last year , some 45 percent of all students said they 've sometimes felt too depressed to function , according to an annual survey by the American College Health Association . Nine percent of college students seriously considered suicide . " Some of the key questions that Virginia Tech has brought out are : When do you recognize that a student 's having serious problems ? What steps do you take , and how do you coordinate care ? " says Richard Kadison , director of mental-health services at Harvard University and author of College of the Overwhelmed . Last week , Kadison and other campus psychiatrists from across the country gathered in Washington , D.C. , to map out a better way to meet the demand . Status quo . Many schools are finding that change will be a significant challenge . About 65 percent of campus counseling centers still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it difficult to manage illnesses that require medication . Just 59 percent have a psychiatrist available . And the funds necessary to add expertise can be hard to find . Days after the Virginia Tech slayings , Florida public university administrators asked for $3.5 million to hire more psychologists and campus police officers . The funding was n't approved , and the board of governors plans to ask for funds again next spring . The ratio of counselors to students at the University of South Florida is 1 to 3,500 ; at Cornell , there 's a counselor for every 800 students . Experts say that parents should check out the mental-health resources when they send their child to school and make sure that the counseling office is aware of any history . " Continuity of care is really important , so that people do n't fall through the cracks and have unnecessary stresses and strains , " says Jerald Kay , chair of psychiatry at Wright State University Medical School . The thrust of the movement at institutions in the lead has been to redouble efforts to identify students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some , like Cornell and Wisconsin , are adding counseling offices in dorms and academic buildings so students have ready access ; Cornell has two counselors on staff whose sole job is to talk with faculty and staff and pick up the first inklings of trouble . The University of Illinois requires anyone who threatens or attempts suicide to have a four-session mental-health evaluation . And early-warning systems that involve the entire university community are a priority on many campuses . At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N.Y. , for example , faculty and staff can log concerns about academic problems or behavioral issues on a website , which is monitored by an intervention team of representatives from the dean 's office , faculty , housing staff , campus police , and counseling center . The team meets regularly to decide on an appropriate response . " There 's a heightened awareness , " says Joy Himmel , director of the health and wellness center at Penn State-Altoona , who says more faculty and staff members now serve as her " eyes and ears . " Still , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration to worried parents  --  is the mistaken belief that privacy laws bar any sharing of information , either with others on campus or in a call home . Government analyses of the Virginia Tech massacre say that teachers , staff , and parents have more freedom than they think . Counseling and medical records are confidential once a child is 18 . But professors and other staff who are n't mental-health professionals can discuss concerns about a student among themselves and contact parents , too . Gregory Eells , head of the counseling center at Cornell , says that residence hall advisers sometimes tell him that they ca n't pass on worrisome information because it was communicated in confidence . " I say , no , actually you can report it , and you should , " Eells says . " You can talk to parents ; you can talk to anyone you think appropriate . " Whether counselors call parents is a trickier question , one that weighs the privacy rights of the student against the therapeutic benefit . Sometimes parents can motivate their child to work on changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving the parents makes it worse . " Beyond the medical arena , the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act turns control of student records over to the student at age 18 . But according to the Department of Education , parents have the right to academic and disciplinary information in many circumstances : when they claim the student as a dependent on their tax returns , when the school considers the situation to be a health or safety emergency , and when the student is under 21 and has been caught using alcohol or illegal drugs . Once it 's clear that someone is distressed , schools are more often approaching the student directly . " Many schools with worrisome students are setting up contracts with them , " says Harvard 's Kadison . " If they want to stay in school , there 's a reasonable expectation that they 're getting care , that they 're showing up for appointments . " Students who appear to be in danger or who are disruptive may be placed on involuntary leave and be reassessed before they can re-enter . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attorney for the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law in Washington , D.C. She says that she hears of more and more cases in which students were placed on leave merely because they were experiencing the ups and downs of mental illness . In one recent example , a student was asked to leave campus after he sought help dealing with a bad reaction to the sleeping pill Ambien . " People should feel safe in getting mental-health counseling , " Bower says . The tragedy will only be compounded , she thinks , if Virginia Tech becomes an excuse to stereotype people with mental illness and bar them from campus .
