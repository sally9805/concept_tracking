Q My 7-month-old constantly flips onto his tummy in his crib , which worries me because of SIDS . Is it okay to let him sleep that way ? I get this question often , and I 'm glad  --  it means that parents are taking SIDS ( sudden infant death syndrome ) precautions seriously and putting their infants to sleep on their backs to avoid suffocation . SIDS is most common before babies turn 6 months old , especially between 2 and 4 months . After that , their neurologic systems are more developed , so their brains can better signal them to breathe when they 're not getting enough oxygen . They also have the motor skills now to turn their heads to breathe . So put your child to bed on his back ( the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends doing this for the first year ) , but if he flips over later , it 's okay . Just be sure to follow the other SIDS guidelines until he 's 1 , such as : * Use a firm mattress * Avoid soft bedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * If you want your baby to sleep near you , go for a crib in the same room , instead of sharing a bed . Easier doctor 's visits Q After a trip to the ER ( for a pea up her nose ) , my 3-year-old has an intense fear of the doctor . How can I help her get through it ? I do n't blame her . Emergency rooms are scary places , even for adults . When my son Zack was a toddler , he had a long , needle-filled visit to the ER and for a year freaked out anytime we walked into a doctor 's office . Since your daughter is a bit older , she 'll be easier to reassure . The key is to prepare her in advance . Next time she 's due for a doctor 's visit , explain what will happen and that he 's there to make her feel better . Snuggle with her and read a story about going to the doctor . There are lots of children 's books  --  with familiar faces like the Berenstain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Role-playing can also help . Use a toy doctor 's kit to show her how to give her dolls and stuffed animals an " exam . " A social visit or two to the doctor , where she sits on the table but nothing scary happens , can be a good idea ; talk to your doctor to see if that 's possible . Kiddie dandruff Q When I brush my child 's hair , flakes fall out . Her scalp is dry and has yellow patches on it , too . What 's going on ? Your daughter probably has seborrheic dermatitis  --  also known as dandruff in adults and cradle cap in infants . This condition runs in families and tends to occur where the skin gets oily , like on the scalp , eyebrows , and eyelids and in folds of the skin . It 's not contagious or dangerous , although it can be itchy . You should give your doctor a call , though , to rule out tinea capitis , a common fungal infection that can also cause scaly yellow patches but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees that she has a version of cradle cap , buy some over-the-counter dandruff shampoo and give your daughter 's head a gentle , thorough scrubbing every day . Leave the shampoo in for five minutes , making sure to keep the suds out of her eyes , and rinse well . Then use a soft brush or fine comb to work off any loose scales . If things do n't improve within a couple of weeks , check back with your doctor . A prescription lotion or cream , or a trip to the dermatologist , may be the next step .
