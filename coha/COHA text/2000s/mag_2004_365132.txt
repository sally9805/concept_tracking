The scariest part of a horror film often is waiting for it to start . You hear the premise ( The Sixth Sense 's " I see dead people " ) or see the trailer ( a ghostly image on a TV screen for The Ring ) , and your palms sweat . Standing in line , you glance around to see if anyone else has that anguished look . By the time the film begins , you 're a nervous wreck . What movie could match your nightmare of anticipation ? <P> For two decades , horror movies have been R-rated snuff cartoons with severed limbs and buckets of blood . The Freddy and Jason films and the Chainsaw Massacres appeal to the connoisseurs of special-effects gore . Every item is laid out for you to see , like the carcasses in a butcher 's window . <P> But there 's another kind of horror , a subtler , more seductive and lingering kind . " Whether it 's Polanski 's Repulsion or Rosemary 's Baby or Kubrick 's The Shining , " says former Fox studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies had a certain elegance to them . " These films tell you that what you do n't know or notice can hurt you . They are to the gore fests as romantic dramas are to porn . They are about mood , atmosphere , the notion that death is everywhere and inevitable . <P> Gross-out horror movies are essentially facetious ; the more artful films are dread serious . " For me , " says M. Night Shyamalan , who revived the ghost-story trend with The Sixth Sense in 1999 , " the challenge is taking a B-movie subject like ghosts or aliens or monsters in the woods and treating it with absolute respect and sincerity . " And at their heart , they have an all-too-human sadness . " There may be a bit more acceptance of horror because of what 's going on in the world today , " says George Romero , director of the classic Night of the Living Dead . " When people feel threatened , they either go to pure entertainment or to something that might strike a chord with the fears they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies is to take ordinary events and invest them with the unbeatable combination of must-see and can't-bear-to-look . Go on , take a stroll in the woods ( in Shyamalan 's The Village ) when you 've been told that monsters lurk there . Or a dip in the ocean ( in the low-budget thriller Open Water ) when you 're left stranded as shark bait . Try to wash out that feeling of dread by shampooing your hair ( in the Japanese spookathon Ju-on : The Grudge ) . You begin to rub in the shampoo  --  and for a moment you feel a third hand , corpse cold , massaging your scalp .
