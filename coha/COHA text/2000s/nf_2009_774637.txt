Irving Fisher Loses His Briefcase , and Then His Fortune // The first serious try to impose reason and science upon the market comes in the early decades of the twentieth century . It does n't work out so well . // It is 1905 . A well-dressed man in his late thirties talks intently into a pay phone at Grand Central Depot in New York . Between his legs is a leather valise . The doors of the phone booth are open , and a thief makes off with the bag . It is , given what we know of its owner , of excellent quality . Finding a willing buyer will not be a problem . // The contents of the valise are another matter . Stuffed inside is an almost-completed manuscript that brings together economics , probability theory , and real-world business practice in ways never seen before . It is part economics treatise , part primer on what rational , scientific stock market investing ought to look like . It is a glimpse into Wall Street 's distant future . // That science and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radical notion in 1905 . " Wall Street and its captains ran the stock market , and they and their friends either owned or controlled the speculative pools , " recalled one journalist of the time . " The speculative public hardly had a chance . The right stockholders knew when to buy and sell . The others groped. " // Times , though , were changing . Good information about stocks and bonds was getting easier for the " speculative public " to obtain . Corporations had become too big and too interested in respectability to be controlled by just a few cronies . The dark corners of Wall Street were being illuminated . Maybe the investing world was ready for a more scientific approach . // The stolen manuscript was never seen again , but its author , Yale University economics professor Irving Fisher , had a habit of overcoming setbacks that might cause a lesser ( or more realistic ) individual to despair . As he prepared to set off for college in 1884 , his father died of tuberculosis , leaving the undergraduate to support his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to take off in the late 1890s , Fisher himself came down with TB , which incapacitated him for years . In 1904 , finally healthy and working again , he watched as fire consumed the house just north of Yale 's campus where he lived with his wife and two children . // And then the theft of his manuscript . Afterward , inured by then to disaster , Fisher went right back to work . He resolved always to close the door when he entered a phone booth , and he rewrote his book , this time making copies of each chapter as he went along . Published in 1906 as The Nature of Capital and Income , it cemented his international reputation among economists . It became , as one biographer wrote , " one of the principal building blocks of all present-day economic theory . " // Its impact on Wall Street was less immediately obvious . Stockbrokers and speculators did not rush out to buy the book . There 's no evidence that investors began making probability calculations before they bought stocks , as Fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was lacking in street smarts . His ideas began to have some impact in his lifetime , and after his death in 1947 , they took off . // Books directly or indirectly descended from Fisher 's work now adorn the desks of hedge fund managers , pension consultants , financial advisers , and do-it-yourself investors . The increasingly dominant quantitative side of the financial world-that strange wonderland of portfolio optimization software , enhanced indexing , asset allocators , credit default swaps , betas , alphas , and " model-derived " valuations-is a territory where Professor Fisher would feel intellectually right at home . He is perhaps not the father , but certainly a father of modern Wall Street . // Hardly anyone calls him that , though . Economists honor Fisher for his theoretical breakthroughs , but outside the discipline his chief claim to lasting fame is the horrendous stock market advice he proffered in the late 1920s . Read almost any history of the years leading up to the great crash of October 1929 , and the famous Professor Fisher serves as a sort of idiot Greek chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices had reached a " permanently high plateau . " He was n't just talking the talk . Fisher blew his entire fortune ( acquired through marriage , then increased through entrepreneurial success ) in the bear market of late 1929 and the early 1930s. // Fisher 's two historical personas-buffoon of the great crash and architect of financial modernity-are not as alien to each other as they might at first appear . In the early years of the twentieth century Fisher outlined a course of rational , scientific behavior for stock market players . In the late 1920s , blinded in part by his own spectacular financial success , he became convinced that America 's masses of speculators and investors ( not to mention its central bankers ) were in fact following his advice . Nothing , therefore , could go wrong . Irving Fisher had succumbed to the myth of the rational market . It is a myth of great power-one that , much of the time , explains reality pretty well . But it is nonetheless a myth , an oversimplification that , when taken too literally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the first in a line of distinguished scholars who saw reason and scientific order in the market and made fools of themselves on the basis of this conviction . Most of the others came along much later , though . Irving Fisher was ahead of his time . // He was not , however , alone in his advanced thoughts about financial markets . In Paris , mathematics student Louis Bachelier studied the price fluctuations on the Paris Bourse ( exchange ) in a similar spirit . The result was a doctoral thesis that , when unearthed more than half a century after its completion in 1900 , would help to relaunch the study of financial markets . // Bachelier undertook his investigation at a time when scientists had begun to embrace the idea that while there could be no absolute certainty about anything , uncertainty itself could be a powerful tool . Instead of trying to track down the cause of every last jiggling of a molecule or movement of a planet , one could simply assume that the causes were many and randomness the result . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ignorance , that we can arrive at conclusions , " wrote the great French mathematician and physicist Henri Poincar ? in 1908. // ( Continues ... ) //
