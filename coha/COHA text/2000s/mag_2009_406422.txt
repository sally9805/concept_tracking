Summer pleasures top the menu when Joanne de Guardiola and family are at home in their Southampton cottage . Photographs by James Merrell Over the past decade or so , as the hamptons have provided tons of grist for tabloid gossip columns , it has become easy to forget that another , more cordial social milieu still thrives on the East End of Long Island  --  one centered not on nightclub VIP rooms and access to hot restaurants but rather on family , friends , gardening , good food , good wine and good conversation . Interior designer Joanne de Guardiola and her husband , Roberto , an investment banker , are among the custodians of the latter , tradition-oriented style of Hamptons living . During the week , the de Guardiolas reside in New York City , where they have an apartment on Fifth Avenue near the lower end of Central Park . They keep busy with their careers and are fixtures on the charity-gala circuit . But on weekends the couple just wants to unwind . Photograph : What 's the news ?

An iron chandelier from John Rosselli hangs above a custom faux-marble-topped table and McGuire chairs . So the de Guardiolas give the signal to their fourteen-year-old twins , Mercedes and Roberto IV , and they all head off to their turn-of-the-century Shingle-style home on a quiet lane in the Old Estates section of the village of Southampton . " We like the low-key side of life here , " says the designer , who honed her craft for six years under the tutelage of decorators Albert Hadley and the late Sister Parish  --  legendary masters of fresh , cheerful yet luxurious decor  --  before going out on her own , in 1996 . " I 've made our house a place where guests feel welcome and where it 's okay for the kids to run inside with bare feet and swimsuits wet from the pool , being chased by the dog . It 's a mess-proof house . There are no silks or satins here . That 's the way I want it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the Shingle style that includes wings on either side of the gambrel-roofed entry facade . The good life in Southampton was n't always so relaxed . Founded in 1640 , the village is the oldest of a dozen-odd communities collectively known as the Hamptons , and the place wears its maturity proudly . The town was the first on eastern Long Island to attract 19th-century tycoons , who were drawn to the ocean dunes and singularly limpid light that would later bring so many artists to the region . Wealthy clients hired architect Stanford White , his lesser-known business partner Charles Follen McKim and others to design the multistoried cedar-clad mansions now so identified with the area . In these houses strict rules of decorum were observed . And as an increasing number of affluent families moved to the East End , friendly ( and not so friendly ) rivalries developed among the villages , each of which was evolving its own unique social codes . Vestiges of the pecking order exist to this day . Photograph : In the library curtains of Clarence House cotton frame a diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpture , Moroccan urns and a quatrefoil mirror . " All the stores in East Hampton are lit up at night , there 's so much emphasis on going out ; and Sag Harbor is just full of restaurants now , " de Guardiola says . " Here , I do n't think a single shop is open after dark , and when we go to dinner we eat at each other 's houses . I 've heard people complain , ' Oh , Southampton puts me to sleep , ' and I want to ask , ' Well , is n't that the whole idea ? ' " Photograph : De Guardiola , dressed for town in an Eric Javits sun hat . Brought up in Michigan , de Guardiola appreciates the all-American ways of Southampton : the annual Fourth of July parade , with its marching bands and baton twirlers ; the Main Street trick-or-treating that takes place each Halloween . And in an odd way , the architecture of de Guardiola 's house suggests an original owner who shared her tastes for unpretentious pleasures . At first glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees from the driveway is a simple three-story structure with a porch , a single dormer window and a porte cochere . Once you are inside , however , the impression changes . A thirty-six-foot-high entry hall with a fireplace leads directly into a formal dining room , at which point you realize that trees and bushes outside the house have blocked from view two wings that sweep back from the central rectangle . Photograph : An oversized Moroccan jar and a shield-back chair , both from Sister Parish 's estate , are front and center in the living room . " It 's grand , no doubt , but it also has an intimacy about it , " de Guardiola says . " The house was built for Andrew Carnegie , I believe , in 1895 , and it stayed in the Carnegie family until 1952 . " Though it 's uncertain who the architect of record was , the designer admires the result . " Someone must have made a very careful study of the movement of the sun and wind , " she says , " because every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which is about a quarter of a mile away . Photograph : A tiny oil painting on a tray-top table begs a closer look . The de Guardiolas purchased the five-acre property in 1994 and set to work bringing the wiring , heating and air-conditioning systems up to date . Traces of Gilded Age architectural planning , like separate ladies ' and gentlemen 's sitting rooms , were eradicated ; two rooms on the first floor were consolidated to make a modern kitchen and a stylish pantry , where cocktails and hors d'oeuvres are prepared . On the third floor , walls were removed to turn servants ' quarters into a nursery for Mercedes and Roberto , who were toddlers at the time . Decades of paint and wallpaper were stripped away , but the designer kept most of the original moldings , even though they had dings and dents . " The marks spoke of the life of the house , " she explains . Photograph : From one garden into another : The transition from breakfast room to living room . As she set to her decorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to me was to create a warm and inviting home . But I also wanted to keep the flavor of the 1890s  --  that wonderful graciousness  --  and to choose furnishings and finishes that would respect the bones of the house . " The dining room , for example , called for furniture of substance , and she outfitted it with a long Regency-period table and chairs . But she took several steps to alleviate any starchiness . She chose not to hang a chandelier , and in one corner she repurposed a 19th-century English bookcase to display a collection of bouncy blue-and-white Chinese porcelain . De Guardiola drew on a chinoiserie theme in several rooms , particularly in accent pieces . " Chinoiserie kind of blurs the line between the classical and the fresh , " she says . " It 's very traditional , but it 's also colorful , exotic and fun . " Photograph : Roberto and Mercedes under a shower of hydrangeas . Fun is a key element in de Guardiola 's designs . With a few strokes , she converted a pointless-seeming anteroom between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charming breakfast room furnished with painted bamboo chairs and a faux-marble-topped table . She installed French doors that open onto the terrace and swimming pool , and she commissioned a New York artist , Susan Huggins , to paint a mural that depicts a fantasy bamboo garden populated by monkeys , a leopard , bees , birds and butterflies . " When the kids were little , " the designer notes , " they were always finding some new detail in the mural . " Photograph : Pratesi linens and a custom side table in the master bedroom . The living room is " where we tend to gravitate , " says de Guardiola . " It 's a cozy cocoon . " To some , softening the grandeur of a space that is perhaps forty-five feet square , features neoclassical garland moldings and is surmounted by an elegant vaulted ceiling some sixteen feet high might have seemed an impossible task . But as the designer says : " The yellow-hued walls , the upholstered furniture , the chintz floral fabrics and the sisal rug tone down the formality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged four separate seating areas to divide the space into conversation zones , the most popular being a window seat bracketed by a pair of slipper chairs . " When they were younger , the twins would curl up here and I would read to them , " de Guardiola recalls . " That 's where I read them all the Harry Potter books , which they adored . They even named our Yorkie Harry Potter . Guests love the window seat too . " She adds , archly , " Sometimes it 's hard to get them to move . " Photograph : Chintz and chinoiserie , staples of traditional decor , pop up in the living room where a Chinese-style low table partners with a sofa covered in a classic Colefax &; Fowler chintz . The framed pastel drawing is by Southampton artist Dora Frost And who could blame them ? In this house , as in the social sphere that de Guardiola and her family inhabit , the emphasis is on bonhomie and comfort . And there is a place to suit any mood or atmosphere .

Above the master bedroom , de Guardiola created another level that consists of a small sitting room with a balcony , where her Cuban-born husband can enjoy an occasional cigar . Photograph : The Indian-themed screen is French . De Guardiola designed the painted sisal carpet herself at Manhattan 's EverGreene Architectural Arts . The armoire in the master bedroom is also one of her designs . Such thoughtfulness may be the keystone of de Guardiola 's character , both as a designer and as the avid and enthusiastic hostess that she is . There is little , it seems , that she wo n't do for the sake of the pleasure of her friends , who include a broad swath of New York 's intellectual , cultural and political leaders , among them New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg , architect Richard Meier , philanthropist Hilary Geary Ross , writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnate and GOP activist Georgette Mosbacher and fellow interior designer Charlotte Moss . Case in point : rather than omit folks from her dinner-party lists for lack of space , de Guardiola had an old double-height stable on a far corner of the property raised on jacks and moved several hundred yards to a spot adjacent to the pool , where the spruced-up structure can now hold dinners for upwards of seventy-five guests . Photograph : She outfitted a porch off the main house with Laneventure wicker furniture and a wooden table from Ralph Lauren Home , paired with Williams-Sonoma Home chairs One afternoon last year , the designer hung huge paper lanterns from the stable 's rafters on long wires so that they would dangle a couple of feet above the long tables she 'd set up . She chose tablecloths of white burlap , on which she arranged rows of white candles in different sizes and little vases of white flowers . Photograph : After some careful planning , de Guardiola relocated the pool to a more central area and hedged it on three sides .

IT TAKES A VILLAGE Joanne de Guardiola 's gracious take on Southampton style is grounded in a love of the landscape and the life of the village . And just a smidge of chic . " I like to give my business to the old-time stores in town , " she says . " The clerks know your name , they are so helpful , and I always run into my friends .
