Section : Special Report E-Learning Guide A good deal on a distance degree may not be a good value <p> When Margaret Chester decided to get her doctorate in health and human services in 1996 , Columbia Pacific University sounded perfect . Based in San Rafael , Calif. , the distance-learning institution offered a self-paced curriculum that would allow Chester to earn her Ph.D . while working , raising a family , and tending a farm in rural Hawaii . The beauty of the school was its flexibility . Each student prepared " learning contracts " that defined his or her own path of independent study . There would be no classes or exams . <p> Things went smoothly at first . The 25 or so papers Chester wrote garnered good grades and complimentary comments . But once she began preparing her dissertation , Chester began to worry . She said her faculty adviser rejected three proposals without providing meaningful advice , except to urge her to buy yet another book on how to write a dissertation proposal . Checking up on Columbia Pacific last year , Chester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1978 , had operated without state approval to grant degrees since 1997 . After much soul-searching  --  Chester had worked hard and had already spent $8,600 in tuition alone  --  she withdrew . <p> Closed . The judge who ruled to yank the school 's approval cited such flaws as the failure to develop course objectives , the granting of excessive credit for prior experience , and the awarding of Ph.D . degrees to students who had " not done the kind of scholarly research and analysis expected at that level of study . " What 's more , the school failed to employ enough qualified faculty . Nonetheless , the school continued to operate as it appealed the decision through the California courts . Earlier this year , the attorney general won a court order allowing the state to close down Columbia Pacific . Anyone who enrolled or graduated on or after June 25 , 1997 , is entitled to a full tuition refund . Degrees granted before that date are valid in the state 's view . <p> Distance-learning programs have multiplied explosively in the past several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true educational caliber . " It 's relatively easy for these organizations to operate , " says David Longanecker , executive director of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education . " Each state has its own rules and regulations with respect to quality assurance . " At the far extreme , the academic value  --  or lack of it  --  seems pretty clear : At www.degrees-r-us.com , for example , $425 nabs a bachelor 's degree from an unnamed university " in 10 days or less ! " ( If you want to graduate summa cum laude , that runs an extra $75 . ) <p> It 's far less clear in cases where the school requires real work , as Columbia Pacific did . For most of the time she was enrolled , Chester had no clue that her school 's status was in jeopardy . Indeed , some graduates of the school , which had been awarding degrees for two decades , have been stunned and angered to learn that the quality of their alma mater was in question . " We found the academic rigor to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major California health system who earned a Ph.D . in 1999 . The school 's attorney , Orrin Grover , says he hopes to file a lawsuit to overturn the decision . " I do n't want to criticize the Court of Appeals , but they are just wrong . " <p> Credibility . The reason sincere students can misjudge what they 're buying is that some of the pitches often sound plausible : the promise of academic credit for myriad life experiences . Legitimate institutions do give credit for college-level knowledge . But many of these schools have no guidelines for judging or documenting prior learning ; some simply evaluate a candidate 's resume to determine what type of degree to award . Moreover , some of these entities claim accreditation by a phony agency or imply that a business registration is a seal of approval . " When you say licensed or regulated by the state , that denotes some kind of imprimatur that does n't exist , " says Stephen Levins , acting executive director of the Hawaii Office of Consumer Protection . <p> To avoid an unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background with your own or the appropriate state department of higher education . " Call us , " says Kay Hancock , assistant director for academic affairs for the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education . " We know the names of the most flagrant violators . " You 'll want to know if the institution is accredited by one of the regional accrediting bodies or another agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education . For a list of agencies , visit www.ed.gov/offices /OPE/accreditation . <p> The " schools " that simply sell degrees display many red flags . Beware if you 're asked for full payment upfront and immediately . Bona fide colleges do n't , nor do they negotiate the price of tuition or a grade point average , and they do n't require an additional fee to graduate with honors . Examine the college 's Web site . Does it seem comprehensive ? It should . Does it spend a lot of time talking about how accreditation is not important ? It is . Does it note that students from a particular state can not enroll ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not least , does the site display a photograph of a sample diploma ? " That 's a dead giveaway , " says Allen Ezell , a former FBI agent who investigated bogus universities in the 1980s . <p> In a few states , at least , consumers who get degrees from unaccredited institutions are apt to find themselves embarrassed professionally or even out of a job or , at worst , facing criminal charges . In Oregon , for example , using a degree from a college the state does n't deem to be accredited to , say , land a job or gain a promotion is illegal . " The only way to deal with these Internet mail-order houses for degrees is to not treat the degrees as legitimate credentials , " says Alan Contreras , administrator of the office of degree authorization of the Oregon Student Assistance Commission . Last year , says Contreras , a candidate to head the state 's Department of Environmental Quality withdrew his name when it was discovered his bachelor 's degree was from an unaccredited school . Indiana and New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Crackdown . Most states are n't quite so aggressive , but more are taking action . South Dakota , once a hotbed of spurious schools , rolled out a new law this year banning any entity from granting degrees unless it holds legitimate credentials . " This was n't the kind of image and reputation that South Dakota wanted in the higher-education industry , " says Tad Perry , executive director of the South Dakota Board of Regents , who notes that , unfortunately , many offenders have simply moved on . In May , Hawaii sued the Prescott College of Business &; Leadership Studies for deceptive practices , and last week the state won a default judgment against Prescott for $500,000 . Meanwhile , the school " switched the name from Prescott to Clermont and moved from Hawaii to Montana , " says Jeffrey Brunton , an attorney in the Hawaii Office of Consumer Protection . The Clermont Web site is essentially the same as Prescott 's old site , he says .

Montana authorities are currently investigating several degree granters , including Clermont , and are exploring the possibility of a group injunction to halt their activity . " You ca n't operate a business for profit that violates a state law , " says Cort Jensen , an attorney in the Montana Office of Consumer Protection . <p> Many experts strongly approve the states ' new militancy as a way both to protect the unwary and to foil degree seekers bent on fraud . At many of these schools , most students " know what they are doing and will see if they can get away with it , " says John Bear , coauthor of Bears ' Guide to Earning Degrees by Distance Learning ( 2001 , Ten Speed Press , $29.95 ) . " They rationalize it to themselves . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : DISAPPOINTED . Margaret Chester found out that not all Ph.D . programs are equal . <p> By Margaret Mannix <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
