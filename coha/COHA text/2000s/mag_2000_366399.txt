Gap peddles clothes , but Abercrombie &; Fitch sells a technicolor teen lifestyle  --  one of the reasons it is the brand of the moment . At A &F; headquarters near Columbus , Ohio , retailing has become akin to moviemaking . The theme is popularity , and it 's packaged , marketed and playing at a mall near you . Every flannel and fleece pullover is choreographed to present the appearance of effortless cool . Yes , the tag on the $59.90 paratroop pants proclaims that they 've been TESTED , but that 's a prop , part of the romantic retail fantasy . " You buy into the emotional experience of a movie , " says the director , CEO Michael Jeffries . " And that 's what we 're creating . Here I am walking into a movie , and I say , ' What 's going to be the box office today ? ' " <P> At this point , Abercrombie &; Fitch is a blockbuster . Its sales have jumped from $165 million in 1994 to an estimated $1.06 billion in 1999 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has expanded from 36 stores in 1992 to 230 this year . Its quarterly " magalog " has become a youth manual . In schools across America , Abercrombie is shorthand for popular . " They 've shot out from nowhere to become part of teen culture , " says Michael Woods , vice president of Teenage Research Unlimited . Last year kids ranked A &F; as the sixth coolest brand  --  up from 11th , and passing Levi 's and Nintendo  --  according to a recent TRU survey . And A &F's; place in youthography was officially sealed in the rap song Summer Girls , by Lyte Funkie Ones : " When I met you I said my name was Rich ; /You look like a girl from Abercrombie Fitch . " <P> It 's not what you 'd expect from a 108-year-old company that worshipped Wasp culture and outfitted Teddy Roosevelt 's safaris . The Limited bought the once bankrupt company in 1988 , then jettisoned it to shareholders in 1998 . The youthful Jeffries , 55 , resuscitated Abercrombie by preserving its East Coast roots but repositioning its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death " in favor of the 14-to-22 set . A &F; shrewdly understands that teens want to belong , and has captured their dollars by making sure they want to belong to the beautiful , exclusive world that the Abercrombie image projects . It 's burnished by 3-D employees who have the requisite looks . The two-dimensional advertising version is supplied by photographer Bruce Weber 's youth beefcake : frolicking models , draped in nearly as much eroticism ( hetero and homo ) as they are in sweaters . A &F; merchandisers visit a different college campus every weekend to keep a close tab on what kids are wearing . <P> A &F; is n't so cool on Wall Street . The stock was pounded last October on fears that the company 's 30% annual growth might be slowing . Yet in the Christmas quarter , sales rose 27% on the strength of the magalog , themed Naughty or Nice , which gained notoriety with its racy pictures and an interview with a porn star , prompting public complaints from the attorney general of Michigan and the Lieutenant Governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to the youth market ? <P>  --  By Stacy Perman/Reynoldsburg
