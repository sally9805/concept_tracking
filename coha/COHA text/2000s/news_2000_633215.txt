<p> I agree with your editorial ( Jan. 3 ) calling for a better way of selecting judges in Cook County . You are all too correct in describing the process as " crass , cynical and haphazard . " <p> However , your call for the Illinois General Assembly to begin reforms by at least enacting a merit retention system is at best naive . Given the recent track record of the General Assembly , one would have a better chance of seeing the Chicago Bulls win their next 40 games than to get any true reforms enacted by the current Legislature . <p> The Legislature 's most recent " reform " more than quadrupled the number of petition signatures needed to file for a countywide judgeship in the Democratic primary ( tantamount to election in Cook County ) . This made it impossible for many qualified candidates who lacked adequate political connections ( to bring in the needed signatures ) to even file as a candidate this year . <p> What can the Sun-Times do to improve the system as it is now ( rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ? You can start by once again endorsing candidates for Circuit Court judge rather than simply printing bar association ratings . ( If two or more candidates in a race have the same bar ratings , should the voters flip a coin in the voting booth ? ) <p> Start profiling the candidates and reveal any shortcomings they might have before they win election to the bench . ( For example , there is the case of a Bridgeport woman running for a subcircuit judgeship who was admitted to the bar in 1994 . ) <p> You and the rest of the news media should try to monitor the other stages of judicial selection . The media need to check out the qualifications of the appointments made to the bench by the Illinois Supreme Court . You also should pay close attention to the candidates for Justice Michael Bilandic 's Supreme Court seat , because the winner of the Democratic primary will fill one-third of the court vacancies from Cook County in the next decade . <p> As for slatemaking , you should show who was slated based on legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These steps will let the Sun-Times make a difference in improving the judicial selection process , and avoid the effects of underqualified and unqualified judges continuing to be selected in Cook County . <p> Randall Sherman , <p> secretary/treasurer , <p> Illinois Committee <p> for Honest Government <p> Unflattering eulogy <p> There is a clear difference of opinion regarding former union leader Edward T. Hanley and his legacy , while the facts surrounding Hanley 's actions and the actions themselves seem perfectly clear . <p> While Jack Lavin says Hanley had " millions of friends from governors to mayors , " Lavin fails to mention that he himself is one of those friends , as he continues to collect a six-figure salary from the union Hanley once led . <p> And while Ald. Edward Burke mentions Hanley 's charitable efforts , Burke fails to mention that the federal government has called into question most of the money that was donated because the money used was from union funds . Neither Lavin nor Burke mentions how Hanley 's " legacy " was even remotely related to his job or the hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Hanley virtually ignored their needs for years . <p> The remarks of rank-and-file members Marty Prieb of Chicago and Jon Palewicz of San Francisco portray a man interested only in himself , his family and his friends . It is clear Hanley may have been a good friend to some , and a man who knew governors and mayors because he contributed hundreds of thousands of union dollars to their campaigns . It is also clear that his passing is a time of great sorrow to his family and friends . But as a labor leader who should have had the best interests of the working members in mind , he was a failure . Hanley epitomized everything wrong with the labor movement and labor leadership in America today . <p> James Michalik , Des Plaines <p> A noble profession <p> I am responding to the letter of Sharon Novickas ( Jan. 6 ) regarding shortcomings in the education system and the teacher shortage . <p> There was a time when teachers had authority and were regarded with respect from students and their parents . It matters little if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession used to be regarded as a sacred and admirable calling . What has happened to the teaching profession , educational system and the shortage of teachers is largely our own fault . <p> As a country we continue to grossly overpay and reward athletes , runway models and movie stars . We are to blame for the conditions in our schools and the shortage of teachers . <p> Our teachers need our help . Our teachers need us as parents to explain to our children that education is a precious gift  --  one that demands our attention and continuing respect . Perhaps we could explain to our children how important the teaching profession is and reward teachers handsomely for undertaking to shape young minds . <p> There always will be professions that boast higher salaries , but there is no profession that impacts our children and our country more than our teachers . <p> Jane McFadden , Roselle <p> A man of principle <p> Steve Neal says ( column , Jan. 5 ) that seven out of 10 voters in Sen. Patrick J. O'Malley 's ( R-Palos Park ) district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a stand on the Safe Neighborhoods Act . Well , in a telephone call to me , O'Malley said that voting " present " was actually a " no " vote to Gov . Ryan 's provisions in the bill . Therefore , he believes he took a stand . <p> Robert Knox , Alsip <p> The right to know <p> Dennis Byrne 's entire premise is false ( " Oregon adopts cruel policy in limiting privacy , " column , Jan. 5 ) . Women who place children for adoption never were promised anonymity , especially not from their own progeny . That is why a three-judge panel unanimously held that birth mothers have no constitutional right to have the records kept confidential . <p> The court also said birth mothers have no constitutional guarantee of privacy because they had no constitutional right to have their children adopted under guarantees their identities would be concealed . <p> Adoption records always have been available to social workers , adoption agency employees , vital-records employees , lawyers and courts . Adopting parents usually are given a copy of the adoption decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the birth mother . Where 's the anonymity ? <p> As for " unwanted intrusions , " there are existing laws to protect us against harassment . No additional special laws that apply only to one group of individuals are necessary or fair . Sealed adoption records serve only to make adoptees second-class citizens , unjustly denying them the same rights as all non-adopted adult citizens to their own birth records . <p> Mirah Riben , <p> Monmouth Junction , N.J. <p> Ryan comes up empty <p> At issue in the ongoing gun debate in Springfield is whether the punishment for unlawful gun possession should be a misdemeanor ( as it has been for 60 years ) or a felony . Since the level of punishment is the debate , it makes sense to question whether there should be punishment at all  --  especially since these misdemeanor gun offenses in Illinois are not even crimes in 60 percent of states . <p> What are some examples of unlawful gun possession in Illinois ? A gun in the glove box . A gun on one 's person . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inheriting Uncle Bob 's rifle and bringing it home with you from Wisconsin . Is anyone harmed by these actions ? No . Are any of these offenses comparable to real felonies such as murder , robbery or rape ? Gov . Ryan must think so . <p> Ryan is way off base on this one . To quell public fear , he said the proposed felony conviction would affect only gang-bangers and other criminals , not honest citizens . Well , is n't it the height of elitism to propose a law that applies differently to different people ? And who will make the upfront judgment on whether someone is good or bad ? <p> I wonder if Ryan realizes that most of the gang-bangers he 's after are gun-toting minors , Chicago 's child gang members . He has n't explained how the law would assign felonies to children . If it could , then Ryan can lay claim to protecting Chicago 's wayward children by throwing them into the Cook County lockup with the rest of the felons . <p> Keith Hamilton , Glenview <p> Go forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute ( Letters , Jan. 2 ) , writes about the importance of population control . This is yet another example of anti-life propaganda under the guise of concern for the future of the world and the quality of life . <p> Overpopulation is a myth , propagated by the radical environmentalists , the abortion industry and the wealthy elites who simply want to see the poor and less fortunate wiped off the face of the earth . <p> Do n't people realize that God will provide if they trust in him ? Indeed , there is already an abundance of food , land and other resources to go around . <p> I do n't consider a population of 6 billion people to be threatening . And I pray that one day the family planning and reproductive health programs will be wiped off the face of the Earth . <p> Matt C. Abbott , Edgewater
