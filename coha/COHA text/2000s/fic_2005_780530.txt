He hands the binoculars to Avner , lying beside him . Avner looks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass doors of the room next to the library . <p> 235 IN THE BINOCULARS : 235 The panels of glass in the exterior doors of the room are clear , smoke and amber , thick , wavy , bevelled . The room within is panelled with mkrors.set at odd angles , and mirrored doors that swing open and close , catching and losing reflections . A row of big crystal chandeliers down the length of the room add myriad prismatic lights to the confusion . A number of Arab men , perhaps as many as twenty , are moving large wooden boxes around . They 're rendered cubist fragments by the distortions of the glass , the lights and the mirrors . 234A CUT BACK T &34A; Avner and Steve in the dark outside . # STEVE # Can you tell how many ? <p> 235 IN THE BINOCULARS : 235 Avner 's moving the binoculars methodically back and forth , scanning the faces in the library .

He 's in there . <p> 235 IN THE BINOCULARS : Avner focuses the binoculars on the library again . He immediately zooms in on the back of the head of a man , standing near a series of mirrored doors . The man turns . It 's definitely Salameh . He 's talking to someone , smoking a cigarette . Avner 's focusing the glasses , bringing Salameh nearer . The sounds of the night intensify , the music , Arabic conversation from the house , crickets , the distant surf and Avner 's own breathing . Salameh suddenly stops talking , takes a deep drag on his cigarette  --  and then he seems to look straight out the french doors of the library , out through their panes of distorting colored glass , out into the dark , as if seeking out and then locking directly with Avner 's gaze . One of the mirrored doors behind Salameh opens , then another , then another , and all at once the face in the binoculars is repeated , over and over , full face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to be Avner  --  with a strange expression : familiarity , hatred , taunting . CUT BACK TO # STEVE # Too many men . We 're gon na get killed . They hear a sound of someone walking on gravel coming from the garden behind them . They go completely flat and roll deeper into the shadows . Avner leaves the binoculars on the grass . They unsling their rifles and release the safeties . A man is standing with his back to them , taking a leak . He has a kalashnikov slung across his back . Avner sees the binoculars in the verge of the terrace . He taps Steve , and points . Steve mouths a silent " shit " then starts to inch towards the binoculars . The peeing man is finished , he 's zipping up his fly . Steve 's elbow snaps something dry in the grass . The man wheels around . It 's a teenage boy , fourteen or fifteen years old . The boy sees Avner and Steve . He starts to fumble for his kalashnikov . Steve is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . <p> Sr-eve fires , then Avner , one bullet knocking the kid off his feet , the other hitting him in the eye , making his head explode . His body topples back into the bushes . Avner and Steve hear shouts coming from inside the house . Someone in the dining room flings the door opens and calls out something in Arabic . They crouch , edging back into the shadows . Suddenly there 's a burst of machine-gun fire , sending stone and gravel and dirt flying . Steve starts to run back towards the shore . Avner catches his a-m , spins him around and drags him in the opposite direction . Avner runs in this direction , and Steve follows . As they approach the main gates Avner trips , stumbles , cutting his face . He sits there , stunned . Steve hauls him to his feet and they resume their run to the gate . Avner fires at the center of the locked gate while Steve turns and fires several rounds into the blackness behind them . # AVNER # GO ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t o them . The gates burst open , and Avner and Steve run pell-mell down the drlve . Noises of pursuit , runnlng , shoutmg , from wlthm the compound grow closer . There 's a burst of gunfre nearby . Avner and Steve run down the road at top speed . No one is pursuing . They keep running . <p> Avner runs , as we 'd seen him at the start of the sequence : face blacked , bloody cut , sweat , terror . He plunges into the grass field . He runs through the grass . He throws his rifle away into the grass and runs . His speed accelerates . He runs till the world falls away . It is no longer clear where he is . The camera closes in on Avner 's eyes . <p> 250 EXT . THE RUNWAY AT LOD AIRPORT , TEL AVIV - DAY 250 Passengers are descending from an El A1 plane . Avner is among them .
