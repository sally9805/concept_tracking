When the shooting ended in Karbala , a holy city 60 miles southwest of Baghdad , the killing began for the family of Samira Jabar . Emerging on April 6 from two days of hiding from U.S. bombing , Jabar took her daughter Duaa Raheem , 6 , to fetch water . Duaa happened on a black plastic object shaped like a C-cell battery attached to a white ribbon . Curious , she picked it up and brought her discovery home to share with her two sisters . On the concrete floor of their tiny kitchen , she cradled the object in her lap and twisted a screw . The explosion it triggered ripped Duaa 's body in half , killed Duha , 3 , and severely injured Saja , 8 . " We thought we were safe because the bombs had stopped , " says Jabar , 30 , a farmer 's wife . " My daughters were stolen from me . " <P> Duaa had no way of knowing her plaything was a live cluster submunition , the lethal leftover sprinkled by U.S. warplanes and artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are continuing their deadly work among innocents all over Iraq . Unlike GPS-or laser-guided " smart " bombs delivered to , say , a tank or other specific target , cluster bombs come packaged in warheads that split in midair and rain as many as hundreds of grenade-like bomblets . They are effective against dispersed troops , but the bomblets generally can not be targeted individually . And not all the devices explode on impact . Some remain , like leftover land mines , as a deadly postwar risk to civilians . <P> The U.S. military may have downplayed the extent of cluster-bomb use in Iraq . Amid reports last month of heavy casualties , Air Force General Richard Myers , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said only 26 cluster bombs had landed in civilian areas , resulting in one casualty . That estimate is hard to reconcile with accounts from hospitals , residents and civil-defense officials in Iraqi cities visited by TIME reporters . <P> Moreover , Myers was speaking only about bombs dropped from the air . " Myers has n't talked at all about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rocket systems , " says Steve Goose , executive director of Human Rights Watch 's arms division . An aide to Myers said the Army and Marines do not chart cluster bombs . According to Goose , the multiple launch rocket systems that were present in Iraq can fire 12 rockets at a clip , each of which has 644 submunitions . Assuming the Pentagon 's failure-rate estimate of 16% , that would yield some 1,200 duds in a full volley . <P> Relief workers say the problem is far worse in Iraq than it was in Afghanistan because the Iraqis sited military installations  --  primary targets for U.S. bombs  --  near civilian centers . Karbala is typical . At al-Hussein hospital , 35 bodies have been brought in since the city fell April 6 , many dismembered by a cluster-bomblet blast , according to chief surgeon Ali Iziz Ali . An additional 50 have been treated for fractures and deep , narrow puncture wounds , typical of the weapons . Karbala civil-defense chief Abdul Kareem Mussan says his men are harvesting about 1,000 cluster bombs a day in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that until the military clears the air about the full extent of the bombs ' use , it will be that much harder to round them up and stop the damage .  --  By Michael Weisskopf/Karbala
