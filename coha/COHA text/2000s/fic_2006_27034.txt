T-minus two days and counting saturday , august 26 , 7 P.M. I should have known from the way the woman kept looking at my name tag that she was going to ask . " Steph Landry , " she said as she pulled out her wallet . " Now , how do I know that name ? " " Gosh , ma'am , " I said . " I do n't know . " Except that , even though I had never seen this woman before in my life , I had a pretty good idea how she might have heard of me . " I know , " the lady said , snapping her fingers , then pointing at me . " You 're on the Bloomville High School women 's soccer team ! " " No , ma'am , " I said to her . " I 'm not . " " You were n't on the court of the Greene County Fair Queen , were you ? " But you could tell , even as the words were coming out of her mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Indiana county fair queen hair  --  i.e. , my hair is short , not long ; brown , not blonde ; and curly , not straight . Nor do I have an Indiana county fair queen bod  --  i.e. , I 'm kinda on the short side , and if I do n't exercise regularly , my butt kind of . . . expands . Obviously I do what I can with what God gave me , but I wo n't be landing on America 's Next Top Model anytime soon , much less the court of any fair queen . " No , ma'am , " I said . The thing is , I reallydid n't want to get into it with her . Who would ? But she would n't let it go . " Goodness . I just know I know your name from somewhere , " the woman said , handing me her credit card to pay for her purchases . " You sure I did n't read about you in the paper ? " " Pretty sure , ma'am , " I said . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing to have shown up in the paper . Fortunately , though , I have n't been in the paper since my birth announcement . Why would I ? I 'm not particularly talented , musically or otherwise . And while I 'm in mostly AP classes , that 's not because I 'm an honor student or anything . That 's just because if you grow up in Greene County knowing that lemon Joy goes in your dishwasher and not your iced tea , you get put in AP classes . It 's actually sort of surprising how many people in Greene County make that mistake . With the lemon Joy , I mean . According to my friend Jason 's dad , who is a doctor over at Bloomville Hospital . " It 's probably , " I said to the woman as I ran her credit card through the scanner , " because my parents own this store . " Which I know does n't sound like much . But Courthouse Square Books is the only independently owned bookstore in Bloomville . If you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the overpass . Which I do n't . " No , " the woman said , shaking her head . " That 's not it , either . " I could understand her frustration . What 's especially upsetting about it  --  if you think about it ( which I try not to , except when things like this happen )  --  is that Lauren and I , up until the end of fifth grade , had been friends . Not close friends , maybe . It 's hard to be close friends with the most popular girl in school , since she 's got such a busy social calendar . But certainly close enough that she 'd been over to my house ( okay , well , once . And she did n't exactly have the best time . I blame my father , who was baking a batch of homemade granola at the time . The smell of burnt oatmeal WAS kind of overpowering ) and I 'd been over to hers ( just once . . . her mom had been away getting her nails done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Lauren 's door to say that the explosion noises I was making during our game of Navy Seal Barbie were a little too loud . Also that he 'd never heard of Navy Seal Barbie , and wanted to know what was so wrong with playing Quiet Nurse Barbie ) . " Well , " I said to the customer , " maybe I just . . . you know . Have one of those names that sounds familiar . " Yeah . Wonder why . Lauren 's the one who coined the term " Do n't pull a Steph Landry . " Out of revenge . It 's amazing how fast it caught on , too . Now if anyone in school does anything remotely crack-headed or dorky , people are all , " Do n't pull a Steph ! " or " That was so Steph ! " or " Do n't be such a Steph ! " And I 'm the Steph they 're talking about . Nice . " Maybe that 's it , " the woman said doubtfully . " Gosh , this is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her credit card was approved . I tore off the slip for her to sign and started bagging her purchases . Maybe I could tell her that the reason she might know me is because of my grandfather . Why not ? He 's currently one of the most talked about  --  and richest  --  men in southern Indiana , ever since he sold some farmland he owned along the proposed route of the new I-69 ( " connecting Mexico to Canada via a highway ' corridor ' " through Indiana , among other states ) for the construction of a Super Sav-Mart , which opened last weekend . Which means he 's been in the local paper a lot , especially since he spent a chunk of his money building an observatory that he plans to donate to the city . Because every small town in southern Indiana needs an observatory . Not . It also means my mother is n't speaking to him , because the Super Sav-Mart , with its reduced prices , is probably going to put all of the shops along the square , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew the customer would never fall for it . Grandpa 's last name is n't even the same as mine . He was afflicted from birth with the unfortunate moniker of Emile Kazoulis . . . although he 's done pretty well for himself , despite this handicap . Continues ...
