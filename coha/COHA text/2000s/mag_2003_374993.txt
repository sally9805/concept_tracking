You feel it percolating in your gut as the guy behind the deli counter serves someone who has waited less time than you . It rises to form a knot of bile as you scamper after a bus that left 10 seconds too soon . It chokes you as your boss  --  say , an editor at the magazine you 've slaved at for years  --  cuts your perfect movie review in half , adds lame jokes ... and then , to compound the injury , sends you out to get her coffee , at that same rotten deli . <P> Desperate men need desperate entertainment : an Adam Sandler movie . <P> In Anger Management , written by David Dorfman and directed by Peter Segal , Dave Buznik ( Sandler ) is a mouse afraid to roar . Traumatized by a childhood depantsing episode , he is reluctant to kiss his girl ( Marisa Tomei ) , sass his boss or speak up for himself in tones above a whisper . Dave needs fate , or a series of preposterous plot machinations , to effect his deliverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapist , Dr. Buddy Rydell ( Jack Nicholson ) . <P> Pause here for a brief head swivel . Jack Nicholson in an Adam Sandler comedy ? That 's right . Nicholson is here to bring a touch of Mephistophelian class to the standard Sandler paranoid-fantasy recipe . Dr. Buddy moves into Dave 's apartment and bed , dates his girlfriend and  --  all right , this is inspired  --  forces Dave to sing I Feel Pretty while parked on a city bridge at rush hour . <P> Every Sandler movie is a course in anger management : in the care and feeding of rage , first suppressed , then geysering into an explosion of smashed crockery and punched-out supporting players . All the ingenuity goes into justifying sociopathic behavior  --  for example , how can Sandler beat the pacifism out of a Buddhist monk and keep the audience 's sympathy ? It 's classically infantile comedy , ending in a payoff so corny it would have made Frank Capra wince . ( This time Sandler has all of Yankee Stadium as his theater of catharsis , with Rudy Giuliani cheering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a step in the maturing of his movie image : penis envy has replaced peeing as a running gag . He also surrounds himself with a high breed of stooge ( John C. Reilly , Woody Harrelson , Heather Graham ) . And even a longtime Adamophobe has to admit that Sandler is an agreeable presence here , and that the film has some funny filigree work to offset the oppressive schematics . It should make audiences happy . But then so did most of his earlier movies , and they were lame , gnat-brained pieces of demagogic doo-doo ! <P> There . I feel better .  --  By Richard Corliss
