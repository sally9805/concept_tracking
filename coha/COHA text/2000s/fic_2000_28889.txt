The Duke and I Chapter OneThe Bridgertons are by far the most prolific family in upper echelons of society . Such industriousness on the part of the viscountess and the late viscount is commendable , although one can find only banality in their choice of names for their children . Anthony , Benedict , Colin , Daphne , Eloise , Francesca , Gregory , and Hyacinth -- orderliness is , of course , beneficial in all things , but one would think that intelligent parents would be able to keep their children straight without needing to alphabetize their names . Furthermore , the sight of the viscountess and all eight of her children in one room is enough to makeone fear one is seeing double-or triple-or worse . Never has This Author seen a collection of siblings so ludicrously alike in their physical regard . Although This Author has never taken the time to record eye color , all eight possess similar bone structure and the same thick , chestnut hair . One must pity the viscountess as she seeks advantageous marriages for her brood that she did not produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are advantages to a family of such consistent looks-there can be no doubt that all eight are of legitimate parentage . Ah , Gentle Reader , your devoted Author wishes that that were the case amid all large families ... Lady Whistledown 's Society Papers , 26 APRIL 1813 Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh ! " Violet Bridgerton crumpled the single-page newspaper into a hall and hurled it across the elegant drawing room . Her daughter Daphne wisely made no comment and pretended to be engrossed in her embroidery . " Did you read what she said ? " Violet demanded . " Did you ? " Daphne eyed the ball of paper , which now rested under a mahogany end table . " I did n't have the opportunity before you , er , finished with it . " " Read it , then , " Violet wailed , her arm slicing dramatically through the air . " Read how that woman has maligned us . " Daphne calmly set down her embroidery and reached under the end table . She smoothed the sheet of paper out on her lap and read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is n't so bad , Mother . In fact , it 's a veritable benediction compared to what she wrote about the Featheringtons last week . " " How am I supposed to find you a husband while that woman is slandering your name ? " Daphne forced herself to exhale . After nearly two seasons in London , the mere mention of the word husband was enough to set her temples pounding . She wanted to marry , truly she did , and she was n't even holding out for a true love match . But was it really too much to hope for a husband for whom one had at least some affection ? Thus far , four men had asked for her hand , but when Daphne had thought about living the rest of her days in the company of any of them , she just could n't do it . There were a number of men she thought might make reasonably good husbands , but the problem was -- none of them was interested . Oh , they all liked her . Everyone liked her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit , and no one thought her the least bit unattractive , but at the same time , no one was dazzled by her beauty , stunned into speechlessness by her presence , or moved to write poetry in her honor . Men , she thought with disgust , were interested only in those women who terrified them . No one seemed inclined to court someone like her . They all adored her , or so they said , because she was so easy to talk to , and she always seemed to understand how a man felt . As one of the men Daphne had thought might make a reasonably good husband had said , " Deuce take it , Daff , you 're just not like regular females . You 're positively normal . " Which she might have managed to consider a compliment if he had n't proceeded to wander off in search of the latest blond beauty . Daphne looked down and noticed that her hand was clenched into a fist . Then she looked up and realized her mother was staring at her , clearly waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaled , Daphne cleared her throat , and said , " I 'm sure Lady Whistledown 's little column is not going to hurt my chances for a husband . " " Daphne , it 's been two years ! " " And Lady Whistledown has only been publishing for three months , so I hardly see how we can lay the blame at her door . " " I 'll lay the blame wherever I choose , " Violet muttered . Daphne 's fingernails bit her palms as she willed herself not to make a retort . She knew her mother had only her best interests at heart , she knew her mother loved her . And she loved her mother , too . In fact , until Daphne had reached marriageable age , Violet had been positively the best of mothers . She still was , when she was n't despairing over the fact that after Daphne she had three more daughters to marry off . Violet pressed a delicate hand to her chest . " She cast aspersions on your parentage . " " No , " Daphne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution when contradicting her mother . " Actually , what she said was that there could be no doubt that we are all legitimate . Which is more than one can say for most large families of the ton . " " She should n't have even brought it up , " Violet sniffed . " Mother , she 's the author of a scandal sheet . It 's her job to bring such things up . " " She is n't even a real person , " Violet added angrily . She planted her hands on her slim hips , then changed her mind and shook her finger in the air . " Whistledown , ha ! I 've never heard of any Whistledowns . Whoever this depraved woman is , I doubt she 's one of us . As if anyone of breeding would write such wicked lies . " " Of course she 's one of us , " Daphne said , her brown eyes filling with amusement .
