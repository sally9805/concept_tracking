<p> The first day of school is n't just a milestone for students . <p> It 's an important day for the more than 1,400 teachers who are new to Gwinnett County 's public school classrooms . <p> The AJC Gwinnett News recently spoke with 10 of the school district 's new teachers to get their thoughts on the upcoming school year . <p> Here are the five questions we asked : <p> 1 . What are your plans for the first day of school ? <p> 2 . What do you fear might go wrong ? <p> 3 . What is the one thing you will not tolerate in your classroom ? <p> 4 .

That is the most annoying and disrespectful thing kids can do . <p> 4 . I 'm not sure yet . But a lot of Spanish teachers give kids a Spanish name .
