Six pastors make a sabbath // RAY WAS TIRED , worn down to the nub . It was the year he was turning 60 , celebrating the 40th anniversary of his ordination and marking 15 years as pastor of his congregation . Ray knew that every pastor goes through dry periods . What shook his foundations was suddenly coming face-to-face with his mortality , or at least the mortality of his ministry . As he put it , " I realize that I 'm not going to see the kingdom come during my ministry . " He continued , " You spend your entire ministry thinking , planning and praying with the future in mind . This is what well do next year , ' and " Someday that will come to pass . ' Suddenly , I know it 's not going to happen . There is no tomorrow . This is it . " Six of us pastors had been gathering twice a year for over five years to laugh , gripe , blow off steam , and enjoy a day or two away from clergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us had shown up with a major personal crisis . To make matters worse , Ray was the elder member of our group , the veteran who always knew what to tell the rest of us . If Ray was in crisis , good old solid Ray , what about us younger and less-experienced pastors ? Ray 's crisis scared all of us-all of us , that is , except Nathan . Nathan had been a pastor long enough to have a few campaign ribbons and battle scars of his own . We did not know it then , but he too had been to the pastoral abyss and returned limping but alive . He was the most theologically liberal among us and the most irreverent . I thought of him as sort of a theological Rod McKuen until , before our eyes , Rod McKuen turned into Virgil leading Dante through the Inferno . For a day and a half , while the rest of us were praying with Ray and offering words of support , Nathan questioned , wrestled , confronted and cried with him . We stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " about vocation , mortality , pastoral ministiy and what it takes to stay with it over 40 years , especially when it is not turning out the way you had always thought it would . After 36 hard hours , Ray emerged , blinking in the light , and returned to his pastorate . Six years later he continues to serve in what have been the most fruitful , thriving and fulfilling years his congregation has seen in a generation . Nathan walked out after the gathering clad in shorts , flipflops and Hawaiian shirt . The rest of us walked out barefooted : we had been on holy ground . It was then that we realized that the semiannual overnight gripe and bull session was not enough . We needed each other more than we had realized , and we needed more time . We decided to try a retreat of three or four days . And we called ourselves " the Neighborhood , " named for Will Campbell 's company of friends in The Glad River . Twelve years ago , we had needed some time away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches in Texas , we knew each other enough to know that we would n't get into a fight over theology . Our congregants were good folks who believed in " getting it done . " Since there were not many progressive Baptists in the state , they thought they could make up for small size by working harder . Churches with this kind of mind-set tend to produce or call pastors with the same mind-set , so we each lived in an endless cycle of running here and there and being constantly busy . Finding each other at " Baptist batties , " we would talk about how badly we needed some sabbath time and how good it would be to take some of that time together . One of us knew of a small cabin available , so out came the calendars , and we scheduled the first date . TWICE A YEAR for six years , I 'd leave home early on a Thursday morning and drive four and a half hours to Austin to meet the others . We 'd shop for frozen pizza , Oreos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive to the cabin and begin 12 hours of rapidfire conversation . Eventually we 'd drop onto air mattresses , get up early the next morning and jump back into the car for the drive home . We enjoyed being together , but it was no sabbath . I came back more exhausted than when I left . Because the frantic pace of our gathering was an extension of frantic lives , we did n't realize that anything was wrong . When you 're busy every day , your habit is to be busy . Not to be busy feels so abnormal that you keep filling up the time in order to never stop being busy . Learning to slow down took time and commitment . First , we found new places to meet . Two of us had relatives who owned farm or ranch land with houses available for a couple of weeks each year ( no more sleeping on the floor ) . The kitchens were well furnished , so we could have healthy meals , and each of the houses had porches where we could sit and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other to make sure each of us would follow through . None of us had ever taken this much time away from our congregations except for family vacations or perhaps official continuing education events . To take four days twice a year to do notliing but be together was unheard of , but if any of us backed out because we were " too busy , " the whole thing would come tumbling down . We had to come to terms with leaving our congregations . Could we trust God and trust God s people to get along without us ? Would they even let us go ? After all , we would n't return with Continuing Education Units to show for our time away . When I queried our deacons , their response surprised me . They reminded me that I was always quoting the Puritan phrase " Good sabbaths make good Christians . " should put my time where my mouth was . " Go to the Neighborhood . We 're the deacons , We 'll , handle the pastoral care . " So I did . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon and eat super in a mall town cafe nearby . Our first day ot two together still day has a frantic edge to it , and it takes a couple of days to detoxity from busy-ness . But by the end of days to detoxify from whatever we want to do or not do . Often Nathan can be found in a hammock taking a nap while Ray is smoking his pipe on the porch and Larry is sifting his way through a stack oi good books . A layperson at Charlie 's church taught him how to smoke a good brisket , so Charlie puts the brisket on in the morning for us to enjoy for supper ( frozen pizza is out ) . Joe , who ca n't sit still , might chop wood for the smoker while I watch a herd of white-faced Hereford cows graze amidst live oak and mesquite trees and relish the fact that I do n't have to organize them to accomplish a task . It does n't take a genius to watch a herd of cows and remember Jesus ' words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither sow nor reap nor gather into bams , and yet your heavenly Father feeds them .... And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life ? " And it does n't take a saint to call the office and hear , " Everything 's fine , " then go for a leisurely walk across a pasture and think , " But if God so clothes the grass of the field . . . will he not much more clothe you ? .... Therefore Jo not worry . " After a while we begin to get the message : " Perhaps I need to he a different kind of pastor . " " Mayhe I do need to trust God and Gods people . " And , " Why have n't I learned this before ? " After a couple of days we get past the frenetic banter and catching-up and move on to conversations that probe beneath the surface of our lives . For professional handlers-ofthe-holy , talking about God as amateurs is not easy , and our crises and challenges are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while for one of us to talk about the difficulty he was having with his teenage stepson . One of us confessed that his marriage was at risk . We talked and prayed with him and , when we got home , we checked on him to see if he was in counseling with his wife . We listen to one another 's expressions of exhaustion , frustration and loneliness , and have . learned to trust one another enough to talk about our ambition and sense of rivalry with other clergy , even our sense of rivalry with one another . Our deeper conversations remind us that we are different kinds of pastors with Joe and Nathan also approach pastoral life differently . Nathan , in his Hawaiian shirt , is laid-back and casual , while Joe 's easygoing smile masks intensity . And we all learn from Ray and Nathan , who have been pastors longer than the rest of us . My congregation knows that the Neighborhood is one of the most important events on my calendar . When we do annual planning someone always asks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans around them on my behalf-they know that I come back refreshed and full of new ideas , and that I have changed over 12 years . They trace some of that change to time spent with the Neighborhood . I have learned , for example , that good sabbaths not only make good Christians ; they make good pastors and good churches too . Practicing sabbath has allowed me to loosen my grip on running the church . It 's not my church anyway . It s God 's church , and God and God s people are perfectly capable of taking care of business . I am not called to attend every committee meeting or to visit every single person in crisis . The people of God , the body of Christ , minister to the members . As I have learned to back off , the congregation has stepped forward . And when I speak about the need for sabbath , I speak with an authority I once did not have . I practice more of what I preach , and the congregation listens . IN HIS ESSAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To be healthy is literally to be whole . . . . Our sense of wholeness is not just the completeness in ourselves but also is the sense of belonging to others and to our place . ... I believe that the community-in the fullest sense : a place and all its creatures-is the smallest unit of health and that to speak of the health of an isolated individual is a contradiction in terms . " Those of us in the Neighborhood hear Berry 's words differently now than we did 12 years ago . Our health is connected with one another , and we sense that we are more ourselves when we are together than when we are separate . Biblically , the concepts of salvation and shalom describe a condition of community wholeness , in which each individual is in good health only when he or she is an integrated member of God 's people . Through sabbath and holy friendships , God 's salvation now has a concreteness that previously was abstract for us . Sabbath , friendship and salvation are connected .

We needed each other more than that , and we needed more time together .
