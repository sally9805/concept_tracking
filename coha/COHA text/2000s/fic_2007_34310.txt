Chapter One It 's hard to get lost when you 're coming home from work . When you have a job , and a paycheck , the road is set right out in front of you : a paved highway with no exits except yours . There 's the parking lot , the grocery store , the kids ' school , the cleaner 's , the gas station , and then your front door . But I had n't had a regular job in a year and here it was two in the afternoon and I was pulling into my driveway wondering what I was doing there . I cut off the engine and then shuddered , trying to fit inside the sudden stillness . All morning I had been thinking about Bonnie and what I 'd lost when I sent her away . She 'd saved my adopted daughter 's life , and I had repaid her by making her leave our home . In order to get little Feather into a Swiss clinic , Bonnie had reacquainted herself with Joguye Cham , a West African prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Air France . He made a temporary home for Feather , and Bonnie stayed there with her - and him . I threw open the car door but did n't get out . Part of my lethargy was exhaustion from being up for the past twenty-four hours . I did n't have a regular job , but I worked like a dog . Martel Johnson had hired me to find his runaway sixteen-year-old daughter , Chevette . He 'd gone to the police and they had taken down her information , but two weeks had gone by and they had n't turned up a thing . I told Martel that I 'd do the footwork for three hundred dollars . On any other transaction he would have tried to dicker with me , giving me a down payment and promising the balance when and if I did the job . But when a man loves his child he will do anything to have her safely home . I pocketed the money , spoke to a dozen of Chevette 's high school friends , and then made the rounds of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE TIME I was thinking about Bonnie , about calling her and asking her to come home to me . I missed her milky breath and the spiced teas she brewed . I missed her mild Guyanese accent and our long talks about freedom . I missed everything about her and me , but I could n't make myself stop at a pay phone . Where I came from - Fifth Ward , Houston , Texas - another man sleeping with your woman was more than reason enough for justifiable double homicide . Every time I thought of her in his arms my vision sputtered and I had to close my eyes . My adoptive daughter still saw Bonnie at least once a week . The boy I raised as my son , Jesus , and his common-law wife , Benita Flagg , treated Bonnie as the grandmother of their newborn daughter , Essie . I loved them all and in turning my back on Bonnie I had lost them . And so , at 1:30 in the morning , at the mouth of an alley off Avalon , when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up to my window , I rolled down the glass and asked , " How much to suck my dick ? " " Fifteen dollars , daddy , " she said in a voice both sweet and high . " Um , " I stalled . " Up front or after ? " She sucked a tooth and stuck out a hand . I put three new five-dollar bills across her palm , and she hurried around to the passenger side of my late-model Ford . She had dark skin and full cheeks ready to smile for the man with the money . When I turned toward her I detected a momentary shyness in her eyes , but then she put on a brazen look and said , " Let 's see what you got . " " Can I ask you somethin ' first ? " " You paid for ten minutes ; you can do whatever you want with it . " " Are you happy doing this , Chevette ? " Her years went from thirty to sixteen in one second flat . She reached for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not tryin ' to stop you , girl , " I said . " Then let me go . " " You got my money . All I 'm askin ' is my ten minutes , " I said , letting her wrist go . Chevette settled down after looking at my other hand and around the front seat for signs of danger . " Okay , " she said , staring into the darkness of the floor . " But we stay right here . " I lifted her chin with one finger and gazed into her big eyes until she turned away . " Martel hired me to find you , " I said . " He 's all broken up . I told him I 'd ask you to come home but I would n't drag you there . " The woman-child glanced at me then . " But I have to tell him where you are ... and about Porky . " " You cai n't tell Daddy ' bout him , " she pleaded . " One'a them get killed sure . " Porky the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a pock-faced fat man with a penchant for razors , diamond rings , and women . " Martel 's your father , " I reasoned . " He deserves to know what happened with you . " " Porky 'll cut him . He 'll kill him . " " Or the other way around , " I said . " Martel hired me to find you and tell him where you are . That 's how I pay my mortgage , girl . " " I could pay you , " she suggested , placing a hand on my thigh . " I got seventy-fi'e dollars in my purse . And , and you said you wanted some company . " " No , " I said . " I mean ... you are a fine young thing , but I 'm honest and a father too . " The teenager 's face went blank , but I could see that her mind was racing . My appearance had been a possibility that she 'd already considered . Not me exactly but some man who either knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs a night for two weeks , she 'd have to be thinking about rescue - and about the perils that came along with such an act of desperation . Porky could find her anywhere in Southern California . " Porky ai n't gon na let me go , " she said . " He cut up one girl that tried to leave him . Cassandra . He cut up her face . " She put a hand to her cheek . It was n't a pretty face . " Oh , " I said , " I 'm almost sure the pig man will listen to reason . " It was my smile that gave Chevette Johnson hope . " Where is he ? " I asked . " At the back of the barbershop . " I took the dull gray .38 from the glove compartment and the keys from the ignition . Cupping my hand around the girl 's chin , I said , " You wait right here . I do n't wan na have to look for you again . " She nodded into my palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LANKY LaTerry Klegg stood in the doorway of the back porch of Masters and Broad Barber Shop . He looked like a deep brown praying mantis standing in a pool of yellow cream . Klegg had a reputation for being fast and deadly , so I came up on him quickly , slamming the side of my pistol against his jaw . He went down and I thought of Bonnie for a moment . I wondered , as I looked into the startled face of Porky the Pimp , why she had not called me . Porky was seated in an old barber 's chair that had been moved out on the porch to make room for a newer model , no doubt . " Who the fuck are you ? " the pimp said in a frightened alto voice . He was the color of a pig too , a sickly pinkish brown . I answered by pressing the barrel of my pistol against his left cheekbone . " What ? " he squeaked . " Chevette Johnson , " I said . " Either you let up or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it . I was ready to kill him . I wanted to kill him . But even while I stood there on the verge of murder , it came to me that Bonnie would never call . She was too proud and hurt . " Take her , " Porky said . My finger was constricting on the trigger . " Take her ! " I moved my hand three inches to the right and fired . The bullet only nicked the outer earlobe , but his hearing on that side would never be the same . Porky went down to the floor , holding his head and crying out . I kicked him in his gut and walked back down the way I 'd come . On the way to my car , I passed three women in short skirts and high heels that had come running . They gave me a wide berth , seeing the pistol in my hand . " SO WHY 'D YOU LEAVE HOME LIKE THAT ? " I asked Chevette at the all-night hamburger stand on Beverly . She 'd ordered a chili @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They would n't let me do nuthin ' , " she whined . " Daddy want me to wear long skirts and ponytails . He would n't even let me talk to a boy on the phone . " Even in a potato sack you could have seen that Chevette was a woman . It had been a long time since she had been a member of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse . I drove her to my office and let her sleep on my new blue sofa while I napped , dreaming of Bonnie , in my office chair . In the morning I called Martel and told him everything - except that Chevette was listening in . " What you mean , walkin ' the streets ? " he asked . " You know what I mean . " " A prostitute ? " " You still want her back ? " I asked . " Of course I want my baby back . " " No , Marty . I can bring her back , but what you gon na get is a full-grown woman , not no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to let her grow up . She gon na need you to see what she is . ' Cause it wo n't make a difference her bein ' back home if you do n't change . " " She my child , Easy , " he said with deadly certainty . " The child is gone , Marty . Woman 's all that 's left . " He broke down then and so did Chevette . She buried her face in a blue cushion and cried . I told Martel I 'd call him back . We talked three more times before I got all the way through to him . I told him that it was n't worth it for me to bring her back if he could n't see her for what she was , if he could n't love her for what she was . And all the time , I was thinking about Bonnie . I was thinking that I should call her and beg her to come home . (                @ @ @ @ @
