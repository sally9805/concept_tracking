Photograph // The Scouts thought they were just setting out on a 50-miler in Washington State 's Olympic Mountains . But Troop 59 's backpacking trek would also take the guys to another time . The trail they were hiking last August dates back almost 100 years , to when miners and the men who supplied them with goods roamed these hills . Men like Bert Macumber . Back in the summer of 1904 , Macumber guided his string of tired burros across snowfields and other obstacles toward Tull Canyon . He brought hardware , equipment for a sawmill and other supplies bound for Copper City and Tull City , mining towns erected hastily for the Tubal Cain Mining Company . From these makeshift cities , miners rose each day , gouging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper and manganese . Nearly a century later , the Scouts of Oak Harbor , Wash. , followed Macumber 's steps up Tull Canyon Trail . The years have treated the canyon surprisingly well . The views are still breathtaking and majestic , the foliage is lush and green , and the trail is still steep and hard to climb . But alas , Tull City , like Macumber , is just a relic of the past . Mountain Mysteries At trail 's start , the Scouts discovered an open mineshaft carved into the mountain . Each hiker peered into the cold , dark cavity , seeking insight to a miner 's life . The sheer blackness quickly swallowed the beams from their flashlights . Fearing the same might happen to them , they stayed out . Near the opening , they spied a hunk of aluminum . It looked like a piece of airplane . But how , they wondered , did it get there ? And why ? It was another mountain mystery that they pondered as they hiked toward Tull Canyon . One wing quickly became apparent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in a hurry to reach the ore deposits , because the trail seemed to go straight up the mountain . Life Scout Philip George pulled out the topographic map . Its contour lines showed that the route they had just covered gained 850 feet in less than threequarters of a mile . In a hurry , indeed . Farther up the trail , the trekkers came across the answer to one mystery . They found the rest of the airplane , a crashed B-17 . On Jan. 19 , 1952 , the bomber , based near Tacoma , Wash. , was returning from a rescue mission in British Columbia 's Queen Charlotte Islands . It flew into bad weather . Heavy snow turned visibility to near-zero . Making matters worse , its communication and navigational gear malfunctioned . The plane crashed into the side of an unnamed mountain and slid down the snow-slick slope . Five men survived the impact ; the navigator , a flight engineer and a radio operator died . More Problems With Snow Back on the trail , Life Scout Jordan Wolfgang searched the canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched all day and all night , but he would never have found it . Why ? An avalanche in the spring of 1912 had swept through the valley , destroying Tull City . When the Scouts realized there would be no city sighting , Jordan yelled , " Packs on , everybody ! " And they headed out to the destination of the day : Buckhorn Lake . More than a century earlier , miners pitched tents at Buckhorn Lake . They carried their tools to shafts high on the sides of Iron Mountain . But they used a different name for the site . Then they called it " Iron Mountain Camp . " The trail crisscrossed up the slopes opposite Iron Mountain . Jordan stopped the rest of the Scouts as they climbed above the tree line . " See those black holes across the valley ? " he asked the others . " Those are the mines . " Photograph Top : The Scouts examine airplane wreckage .

They had hiked almost eight miles already , and it was still the first day . Joseph said they had gained an impressive-if not painful  --  3,000 feet in altitude . When the guys arrived at the camp site , disappointment struck again . Photograph Heavy packs were n't the only obstacles for hikers Jordan Wolfgang , Cody Wood , Philip George , Erik Lokkins and Eric Vargas . The mountain path ! ; steep ups and downs wore them out . // " There 's nothing here , " sighed Star Scout Danny Case . Snow , rain and other forces of nature had erased any trace of activity at Buckhorn Lake , too . It was yet another relic of yesteryear . Sticks and Stones The next day , they arose rested . Good thing . The physically demanding route they had still to climb included three mountain passes . On the third day out , the Scouts climbed 2,600 feet to a ridge above Constance Pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even worse , scores of shin-skinning , pack-grabbing trees lay fallen across the path . Avalanches , like the ones that doomed Tull City , had knocked them down over the Years . Stopping at the pass to take in the view , the Scouts took a little rest . Cold air , coupled with an eerie fog , blew in from the southwest . The Scouts formed a line , shivering shoulder to shoulder . " It sure does n't feel like August , " Jordan said as he picked up his gear to continue on . With 10 tortuous miles of trail covered , the Scouts at last stumbled into camp . AV " Finally ! " groaned Life Scout Erik Lokkins , dropping to the ground . Most of the Scouts fell asleep long before nightfall . One Last Challenge On the last day , the Scouts followed the Lower Graywolf Trail . There , the Graywolf River offered a final obstacle . They had to cross it Joseph was one of the first to cross . He carefully placed every step , mindful of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making any movements . The Scout cheered as each one successfully forded the river . Finally , at trail 's end , Philip said , " All I want to do now is take a shower ! " Something that no doubt had been on Bert Macumber 's mind , too .
