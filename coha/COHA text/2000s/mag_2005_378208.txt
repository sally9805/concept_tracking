Unless you 're familiar with New York City 's burlesque scene , you may not know about the Glamazons , a troupe of plus-size female dancers who like to camp it up around town . A few weeks ago , however , a handful of Glamazons were featured on a live national radio show , guests of a gay-and-lesbian duo named Derek and Romaine who were celebrating their second anniversary on the air . With a bartender mixing martinis in the studio , the scene was suggestive of radio 's party days , before Big Radio ate the AM/FM dial , demanded quarterly profit growth and sucked the fun right out of the control booth . Except that a wannabe big corporate entity was footing the bill for the show , broadcast from a gleaming new studio in a Rockefeller Center skyscraper . And the Glamazons were tame compared with the time Romaine invited a male porn star into the studio for a little on-air fun , and curtains had to be drawn  --  this for a radio show . " If listeners find it interesting , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole show is about us . " <P> Welcome to Sirius Satellite Radio , a company running edgy programming and sparing no expense in its quest to breathe life into radio  --  and one day turn a profit for shareholders . Based in New York City and run by pugnacious radio-industry veteran and media icon Mel Karmazin , Sirius broadcasts 65 channels of commercial-free music , sliced and diced in formats from Broadway-show tunes to ' 80s hair bands , along with channels dedicated to sports , news , weather and niche shows like Derek and Romaine 's , which would be fined into extinction if the FCC had its way . This being satellite radio , whose subscribers pay a $12.95 monthly fee , the content cops have no say in what 's beamed down from Sirius ' three satellites . And Sirius is taking full advantage of its outlier status to serve up fare you would never hear over the AM/FM dial , from frat-boy channels like Maxim Radio to hip-hop so crude it might make Eminem blush . <P> Sirius and its bigger satellite competitor XM are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Clear Channel and Infinity ( part of Viacom ) have taken advantage of deregulation to buy hundreds of stations with the idea of bringing scale  --  and higher ad prices  --  to the airwaves . For a while it worked , as industry revenues rose at a double-digit clip during the late ' 90s ad boom and stations racked up profits thanks to cost cutting . But for listeners , that consolidation brought homogeneity , as corporate playlists suffocated local jocks , and ever more ads were jammed into each hour . <P> No wonder that in the past year satellite radio , which like cable TV was once laughed at  --  pay radio ? C'm on  --  reached critical mass . Sirius ' audience surged from 351,600 listeners to more than 1.4 million ; XM added 540,000 subscribers in the first quarter of this year to reach an audience of 3.8 million . Reasons : better programming choices ; lots of programming choices . In other words : game on . Advances in technology mean that every listener is up for grabs . Broadcasters have to contend not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers and service providers , iPods and even Internet amateurs who can find audiences for the oddest musical tastes . Broadcast radio 's answer : fighting back with its own digital strategy .
