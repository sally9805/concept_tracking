Good riddance to shrinkwrap and installing programs from CDs-the era of software as a service is upon us. // Eric Engstrom , CEO of Catalytic Software in Bellevue , Wash. , is building a city of white concrete domes just a rickshaw ride outside the city of Hyderabad in south-central India . The former Microsoft executive says New Oroville-named after the town Engstrom comes from in Washington state  --  will be home to some 4,300 Catalytic employees and their family members . All will live in dome-idles complete with modern plumbing , electricity , and broadband Internet connections . Most will walk or bike to work on winding , treelined paths . And some will play in a giant , domed ice rink , which will be the only one of its kind in the world 's most populous democracy . But that 's not the really fascinating part . Engstrom , one of the most credible of Microsoft 's 12 witnesses at the historic antitrust trial two years ago , believes that software is undergoing a massive shift from shrinkwrapped stand-alone applications on CD-ROMs to Web-based service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engstrom of " software as a service " that he 's building his 500-acre city in the desert , where teams of Catalytic engineers will develop software for businesses big and small , deploying and debugging those applications through the Web from thousands of miles away . " Demands on software will only increase over the next 20 years , " Engstrom says . " And the rate of evolution can only be met and managed by remote delivery and management . " Knowing that Microsoft has bet the company on the concept of Internet delivery-which it terms the NET initiative-has bolstered Engstrom 's resolve . " All software , " he predicts , " will eventually be delivered over the Internet . " By building a city of domes in the far reaches of India ( concrete domes , it turns out , are cheap to build and extremely resistant to earthquakes ) , Catalytic is putting into practice the ultimate version of outsourcing-nothing new in itself . Businesses have long used third parties to handle payroll , distribution and manufacturing . The dotcom boom transported the outsourcing concept to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providers . These businesses , known as ASPs , deliver e-commerce Web sites , E-mail , accounting , and other applications for a monthly fee . Recently , major corporations such as Oracle have jumped into the game , demonstrating that software makers themselves can deliver and support their products and services through the Web . Now , by harnessing the Internet , any software company can turn itself into an application service provider whose product is not contained on shiny plastic CD-ROMs , but in a collection of bits and bytes transported , installed , maintained , and upgraded via the Internet . Photograph // Over the past 12 months , an extraordinary meeting of the minds among the technology industry 's leading ( and normally bitterly combative ) companies has set the stage for this transformation . Giants Microsoft , Oracle , and Sun , nasty adversaries on many fronts , joined forces with IBM and Hewlett-Packard to advance technical standards to govern how commercial software will be designed in the near future . The implications are far-reaching , not only for software developers but also for businesses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its formative stages , has already forced some companies to change their business model . This year , Hewlett-Packard , in Palo Alto , Calif. , ditched eight disparate software businesses to focus on a single software-as-a-service strategy . ( Its proposed merger with Compaq is not expected to affect that . ) In February , Sun announced an initiative to facilitate what it calls " software on demand . " Microsoft 's . NET initiative signals the company 's eventual departure from selling licensed software on CD-ROMs to renting software and services right off the Internet . Others are ahead of this game . Intuit , in Mountain View , Calif. , a pioneer in delivering online tax software to consumers and , more recently , to small businesses , is the poster child for software-as-a-service . Intuit began offering one of its signature products , TurboTax , over the Web in 1998 . Since then , the company has seen that delivering software directly to a user 's computer foils the vexing practice of customers sharing shrinkwrapped applications with friends . Then there 's the flexibility of pricing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to April 1 , well before the dreaded April 15 deadline . Raymond Stem , Intuit 's senior vice president of corporate strategy and development , notes that the discount gives consumers an incentive to file early while also smoothing out revenue spikes and burdens to Intuit 's computer system . " Normally I 'd have to brace for all that traffic , " Stem says . " But if I can smooth out online traffic , I do n't have to invest so much in infrastructure . " If the industry continues on the software-as-a-service path-and there 's every indication that it will-software will cease to be thought of as an application that does one thing ; for example , word processing or accounting . Instead , it will be built in such a way that businesses and consumers can pluck entire applications or parts of applications from the Web , paying on a per-use or subscription basis . Better still , advocates say , software as a service will enable customers to harvest what they perceive as the best or cheapest components of one part of an application and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like the Help function of Microsoft Word ( you know , that universally despised cartoon paper clip ) , you could simply order the parts of the program you need . By offering features a la carte , software companies could enable smaller businesses to use applications that previously only the big guys could afford , such as **29;1077;TOOLONG ( CRM ) software . On the other hand , an industry giant like Microsoft could use its clout to restrict such choice . The volume-licensing terms of its new MS Office XP suite , for example , have drawn fire because they call for companies to sign a two-year agreement ; many customers had previously upgraded MS Office only every three or four years . Some companies are finding that they must purchase newer versions of Office just to qualify for the Office XP licensing program . Microsoft will no doubt carefully weigh the revenue implications of allowing users to pick and choose portions of some future Web-delivered version of Office versus restricting the license option to the entire suite . Ideally , applications wo n't care whether your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fought pitched battles against Linux , criticizing the so-called open source operating system as a threat to intellectual property . This imbroglio aside , a goal of the industry is to have software-as-a-service applications " talk " with other applications , so a firm 's payroll program , say , would be able to grab information and functions from an accounting application and put them to work directly . " The software industry as we know it is dead , " says Srivats Sampath , CEO of antivirus software maker McAfee , the Sunnyvale , Calif. , company , a software-asa-service pioneer that 's been delivering code to PCs via the Internet since 1998 . This year , McAfee began targeting the business market . " I will go so far as to say that in five years , all the software that end users experience will be in the form of a Web service , " Sampath says . Industry analysts and observers say software as a service and Web services could help reboot the struggling U.S. economy . While no cure for the ailing dot-com industry , Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as companies begin building , delivering , and managing novel breeds of software tailor-made to run better through the Internet . The Gartner research firm in Stamford , Conn. , figures that the market for Web services-including all the software and hardware needed to run applications via the Internettopped $4 billion at the end of 2000 . If projections can be believed in these uncertain times , Daryl Plummer , Gartner 's vice president of Internet and e-business technologies , predicted ( before September 's terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ) that Web services would skyrocket to a $16.1 billion market by 2004 . Igniting the market is no single super  --  technology , but an amalgam of technologies converging around the notion of reusable software code . Reusable code is what the industry has been groping toward for three decades , according to Eric Pulier , CEO of Digital Evolution in Santa Monica , Calif. , which makes Webdevelopment tools . Pulier 's optimism is based in part on the industry 's near-universal support for standards to help reusable or modular-code software become the de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build applications . Developers traditionally tailored software applications to the operating systems running them  --  which meant tweaking programs with special code so operating system and application could work in harmony . But the Internet opened the way to freeing applications from reliance on the operating system . In theory , software designed to run smoothly over networks would n't need **25;1108;TOOLONG code . Previous efforts at operating-system-neutral software have failed to win universal acceptance , in part because of Microsoft 's opposition . Sun 's Java programming language , unleashed in the mid1990s , was an attempt to foster so-called write-once , run-anywhere code . Around the same time , Larry Ellison , Oracle 's iconoclastic CEO , touted the network computer ( in the form of a simple non-Windows terminal ) as an ideal way to grab software from a central server . Microsoft 's alternative to Java , C# ( expressed as " C sharp " ) , now threatens Java , and the Network Computer remains a fantasy . None of this , however , has stifled the desire for reusable software , and a confluence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into clear sight . By 1998 , the ingredients for Web services and reusable code were in place : the Internet , high-speed local networks in businesses , low-cost computer processing power , low-cost storage , and " a mindset that outsourcing is OK , " says Pulier . But the catalyst was the agreement last year by Microsoft , IBM , Hewlett-Packard , Sun , and Oracle on technical standards to guide the way commercial software will be built in the future . These standards form the basis for hosting , retrieving , and running applications from the Internet on any computer and , eventually , any Web-enabled mobile device . Say what you will about Microsoft  --  critics claim the Redmond , Wash. , behemoth will try to use NET to extend its dominance in the desktop PC market to the Internet-the company has arguably ignited excitement , not to mention investment , in Web services . " When . NET was announced last year , it drew many who were sitting on the Web-services fence , " says Fred Hoch , director of e-business at the Software and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft , so goes the industry . " Photograph // Just ask Scott Blum , founder of e-commerce site Buy.com , who left the company only to buy it back this year . He 's also CEO of Aqueduct , an application service provider in Aliso Viejo , Calif . " I 'm betting everything I own , do , and know on Microsoft 's . NET , " Blum declares . " If they 're betting the company on it , you 'd have to be an absolute fool to think you could beat them or not partner with them . " Certainly Microsoft 's NET initiative has drawn fire . Critics , notably the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Electronic Privacy Information Center , say two pieces of Microsoft 's strategy , HailStorm and Passport , pose risks to privacy . HailStorm is an online service that acts as a digital hub in cyberspace where users can store and grab needed information-calendars , phone numbers , address lists , etc. - from any location , on any gizmo . The companion Passport service , a central repository for personal identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing of personal information among Websites . Privacy groups worry about Microsoft controlling vast amounts of personal information . Microsoft says users have nothing to fear , and it recently announced a partial opening of Passport to thirdparty providers . " With Passport , rather than typing in personal information every single time you visit a site , you can type it in once , " says Pieter Knook , vice president of Microsoft 's network service providers group . " But you control your info and decide how much to share with a Web site . " The great promise of software as a service lies in its ability to deliver at a much lower cost . As much as 30% of the price of traditional software is tied to the cost of distribution-pressing CD-ROMs , packaging them in boxes , shipping them to retail outlets . Digital distribution eliminates the physical element . It also allows application service providers to perform bug fixes , upgrades , and routine maintenance via the Internet , further driving down software costs and allowing information-technology staff at companies to focus more on core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent sophisticated business-management tools previously available only to major corporations . It works the other way , too . Major software vendors , ASPs , and accounting firms ( such as Deloitte and Touche ) are among those that will now be able to target the nation 's vast population of small businesses , once too scattered and thus too costly to acquire as customers . For example , McAfee , the antivirus company , counts as one of its customers a British engineer working at a remote oil facility on the border of Russia and China . " We could never have made it worthwhile to have a software presence in that location without the Web , " says CEO Sampath . That 's not to say software as a service is without pitfalls . Contracting with an ASP , particularly an unseasoned one , means taking on the risk that it might go out of business , leaving customers in the lurch . This happened to children's-clothing company Osh Kosh B'Gosh and more than 100 other businesses getting software services through Pandesic , a joint venture of Intel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly-up last year , its flameout forced the customers to find other ASPs or develop their own information-technology strategies . The ASP industry is still smarting from that one . " The challenge we face is to increase customer confidence , " admits Paula Hunter , chairman of the Application Service Provider Industry Consortium in Wakefield , Mass . At its peak in 2000 , the consortium boasted more than 700 members ; it counts about 450 today . Hunter attributes the decline to consolidation and the natural attrition associated with an immature industry . Some of the very aspects that make software as a service appealing also become liabilities . For example , software as a service allows for quick upgrades , tempting some vendors to rush code out the door before it 's fully baked . " Some companies are shipping code a lot faster than in the past , knowing that if there 's a problem they can fix it faster , " says Mark Shull , CEO of Digex , a Web services provider in Laurel , Md . " On the whole , shipping faster is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . " Another potential headache is being shackled to every new version of software shoved through the pipe . " I do n't get to control the rollout of my application , " says Neal Goldman , an analyst with the research firm The Yankee Group in Boston . Moreover , some industry players worry that Microsoft 's involvement in Web services will allow it to lock users into features of its . NET initiative . " Microsoft 's NET initiative comes between the end user and application provider with recommendation engines , if you will , " says Marge Breya , vice president of Sun 's Open Net Environment ( ONE ) business . Perhaps the greatest challenge facing the software-as-a-service industry will be protection of intellectual property . As Web  --  services standards influence how software is constructed and the line between what 's proprietary and what 's not blurs , software companies will run the risk of patent infringement . " A software service can be built that syndicates someone else 's intellectual property , " notes Gartner 's Plummer . " When you create a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to those who want to use it . If that access is then used to give access to others , you could violate copyright or compromise intellectual property without knowing it . " McAfee put the copyright issue into sharp relief in August when it announced receipt of a patent covering delivery and management of antivirus software services . McAfee applied for the patent in 1998 . Some observers worry that aggressive enforcement of that patent could hobble the entire software-as-a-service industry . " Every patent has a chilling effect , but how much of one McAfee 's patent poses will be determined by how it 's enforced , " says Charles Cella , a former patent attorney and current CEO of BountyQuest Corp. , an online service in Boston that offers rewards to those who successfully challenge patent claims . His company offered a reward for anyone who could successfully challenge Amazon.com 's once-controversial " oneclick " online shopping patent . To Cella , McAfee 's patent is potentially more egregious than Amazon 's . " The worstcase scenario is that McAfee enforces its patent against all ASPs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those anxieties . " Is our patent so broad that it 's going to hit every Web service ? No , " he says . " But will it hit security-management Web services ? Yes . It 's purely to protect our investment . We 're just saying that if you 're going to copy McAfee.com , you 'd better be ready to deal with us . " Finally , there 's a danger that the truce among software and technology firms regarding Web-services standards could fray , leaving the nascent industry in turmoil . Already Microsoft has accused Sun , which it views as a latecomer to the Web-services party , of trying to " pollute " one of the standard protocols as a way to stall market development until it can catch up . Microsoft seems to be borrowing the script from its rival , which accused Microsoft of polluting Java a few years ago . Sun counters that it does have a solid Web  --  services strategy , one that fully supports current standards . It 's just that it believes those standards can do more . Sniping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service are too overwhelming for developers , businesses , and consumers to ignore . And in many people 's minds , the stakes are simply too high for the movement to fail . Web-services standards will simplify life for those writing software code , removing the burden of writing applications for multiple computer platforms . For software companies , software as a service means being able to release upgrades and updates over regular intervals , eliminating feast-and-famine revenue spikes associated with traditional software delivery . When software applications are hosted and maintained by a third party , information-technology staff at companies will have more time for their company 's crucial business needs . Consumers will have access to software they might not have been able to afford otherwise . " Applications will be easier to run and easier to maintain , " says Aqueduct CEO Blum . " Simply put , this is the future of software . " Sidebar Using the Web To Do the Books Sidebar Since the days of the abacus , accountants have been readers of financial scrolls , number-crunching professionals who looked backward through Sidebar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well being . But Web services are increasingly giving accountants immediate insight into a company 's performance , improving business decisions and changing the very nature of the ancient accounting craft . Sidebar PKF Houston , a certified public accounting firm , began using a Webbased accounting service from Intacct late last year as a way to reach smaller , dispersed business clients in the sprawling Texas city it calls home . Many PKF clients now use the Internet to submit financial reports , eliminating the need for accountants to pack up their briefcases and calculators to pay personal visits . Saving drive time is just one advantage . A more dramatic benefit of Webbased accounting services-and one that promises to change the role of accounting firms such as PKF-is the ability to peer into a business ' books at any moment , instead of just at the end of each fiscal quarter . " We want to look forward , to be more consultative , " says Gregory Price , PKF 's director of consulting . Not only can PKF sift through Sidebar financial information in the here and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clients-without ever having to leave the office . Accountant and client each log on to the same secure Web page and view the information at the same time . PKF personnel can more easily spot when a company 's inventory is building up , detect when accounts receivable are stretching out , and even identify who may have taken the top spot as a company 's best customer . Sidebar Because of its generic one-size-fits  --  all nature , a Web-based accounting system is better suited for small- and medium-sized businesses than for enterprises with more idiosyncratic accounting needs . But for those companies willing and able to go the Internet route , the advantages also manifest themselves in audits . David C. Thomas , the founder and CEO of Intacct , which is based in Los Gatos , Calif. , recalls the days when auditors would set up camp in one of his company 's conference rooms during audit season and bombard his staff with questions and requests for reports . Auditors now use Intacct 's Web-services technology to conduct audits remotely over the Internet . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's much less painful . " // <p>
