This study investigated : ( a ) the degree To which one rural state 's alternate assessment influenced daily instruction and IEP development for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities ; and ( b ) in those instances in which teachers reported no influence or a negative influence on daily instruction or IEP development , the reasons teachers gave for these phenomena . The results of this survey support other findings that teachers perceive the alternate assessment to have a greater influence upon daily instruction than upon IEP development ( Towles-Reeves , in press ) . Implications for teacher support and training in alternate assessments , especially in rural areas , are discussed . Introduction <p> A critical clement of No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is to hold teachers , schools , and states accountable for ensuring every student has the opportunity to achieve at high levels . State large-scale assessment systems are the instruments through which the success of schools in teaching students the content ( state academic content standards ) is determined . For most students with significant cognitive disabilities , inclusion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards ( U.S. Dept of Education , 2005 ) . Participation Options in Large-Scale Educational Assessment Systems <p> The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997 ( IDEA 1997 ) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act ( IDEA 2004 ) require that all students , even those with the most significant cognitive disabilities , be included in State and district-wide assessment systems . The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 further requires all students be assessed on grade-level academic content standards through grade-level or alternate achievement standards ( U.S. Dept of Education , 2005 , p. 21 ) . <p> As determined by a child 's Individualized Education Program ( IEP ) team , students with disabilities may participate in large-scale educational assessment systems in one of five ways : the regular grade-level state assessment based on grade-level achievement standards ; the regular grade-level state assessment with accommodations based on grade level achievement standards ; an alternate assessment judged against grade-level achievement standards ( though at this point , very few states have developed this option ; see Thompson , Thurlow , Johnstone , &; Airman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards ( though the federal guidance for this option has not yet been finalized ) ; or the alternate assessment judged against alternate achievement standards . <p> For students with disabilities , the regular grade-level state assessment should always be considered first when deciding how a student should participate in large-scale educational assessments . However , students with the most significant cognitive disabilities typically participate in the fifth option : alternate assessments judged against alternate achievement standards . <p> Alternate achievement standards are " an expectation of performance that differs in complexity from a gradelevel achievement standard " ( U.S. Dept. of Education , 2005 , p. 20 ) . While alternate achievement standards may differ in complexity , they must still be linked to gradelevel content . The U.S. Department of Education ( 2004 ) has made this linkage to grade-level context explicit : " For alternate assessments in grades 3 through 8 based on alternate achievement standards , the assessment materials should show a clear link to the content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled although the grade-level content may be reduced in complexity or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Teaching Grade-Level Academic Content Standards to Students with the Most Significant Cognitive Disabilities <p> Since NCLB requires that all students , including students with significant cognitive disabilities , be assessed on grade-level academic content standards , it becomes imperative that students have access to and receive instruction on that grade-level content . Many students with the most significant cognitive disabilities may be receiving instruction on grade-level content for the first time in their educational careers ( Browder &; Spooner , in press ) . Given this new emphasis , an understanding of the influence of alternate assessments on teachers ' daily instruction and IEP development is critical to discerning the impact of these educational reform efforts for students with significant cognitive disabilities . Since the impact of NCLB has had particular ramifications for special educators of students with significant cognitive disabilities in rural areas ( see Collins et al. , 2005 ) , we were especially interested in the perceptions of teachers from a largely rural state . Collins et al. , in a set of structured telephone interviews with 14 rural directors of special education in one state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptions of the impact of NCLR on their students with significant cognitive disabilities , questioned the focus of alternate assessments on academic skills , the potential loss of instruction on functional skills , and the development of IEPs that were progressively aligned with academic skills , at the exclusion of other life needs . Alternate Assessment 's Influence on Instruction and IEP Development <p> A few studies have examined the consequences of alternate assessments on teachers ' daily instruction and IEP development . Kleinert , Kennedy , and Kearns ( 1999 ) addressed the consequential validity of one state 's alternate assessment through a teacher survey . Kleinert et al . found that teachers recognized the benefits of inclusion in the state assessment system for their students , and that teachers were incorporating the elements of the alternate assessment ( e.g. , student individualized schedules , student self-evaluation ) into their daily instruction . Teachers also expressed considerable concern with the time required to complete portfolios . <p> Flowers , Ahlgrim-Delzell , Browder , and Spooner ( 2005 ) examined 983 teachers ' perceptions of alternate assessments across five states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students should be included in school accountability ; when teachers perceived alternate assessments to be a part of school accountability systems ( as opposed to state-only accountability ) , teachers reported a more positive impact of alternate assessments . Overall , however , only 28% of the respondents reported that their students had greater access to the general curriculum , only 24% noted increased quality of their IEP objectives , and only 25% noted an overall better quality of education as a result of the alternate assessment in their respective states . In fact , the main finding was that 82% of these teachers reported increased paperwork as a result of their state 's alternate assessment . Flowers et al . noted that teachers need models of how to address academic content standards in meaningful ways for their students . <p> Towles-Reeves , Garrett , Burdette , and Burdge ( in press ) investigated the influence of the alternate assessment on instruction and IEP development in one mid-western state . Results of this study revealed that teachers perceived the alternate assessment to influence instruction slightly more than IEP development . Teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influence on certain dimensions of the alternate assessment because : ( a ) teachers did not think the alternate assessment was important or ( b ) they did not have the support within their schools to implement the assessment or particular dimensions of that assessment . <p> In a second study , Towles-Reeves , Burdge , and Garrett ( 2006 ) investigated these same variables by replicating the first study across five states , including the state in the above study . A total of 694 teachers completed the survey . Findings suggested that alternate assessments influenced both classroom instruction and the development of student IEPs . The influence was greater in states with more experience in implementing alternate assessments and in states with more comprehensive professional development systems . Teachers noted that lack of support from school personnel and collaborating teachers hindered their ability to improve instruction . Purpose <p> Given federal policy that requires that alternate assessments based on alternate achievement standards now be linked to grade-level content standards , this study was designed to examine how one rural , mid-western state 's alternate assessment system influenced teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher survey , we hoped to better understand : ( a ) the impact of the alternate assessment within this state and ( b ) how to focus future teacher training on alternate assessments and grade-level curriculum . We chose a state in which 91% of the counties had been identified as rural by the National Association of Counties ( 2006 ) in which to complete this research . The State 's Alternate Assessment <p> The alternate assessment system in this state is a portfolio based assessment designed for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities . The content of the portfolio must be aligned with the state 's content standards . Portfolio evidence consists of student work produced in the classroom , performance task evidence , and a graph of performance data collected over time . As described in the state 's alternate assessment teacher guide , the portfolio requires evidence of student performance in each of the following four dimensions : self-determination , transfer and generalization , achievement of benchmarks , and independent use of adaptations . <p> Self-determination is the ability of a student to control basic decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alternate assessment , the self-determination dimension examines the student 's level of self-direction within instructional activities . Students exhibit control over learning activities through choice , reflection , and use of evaluation to adjust future performance . <p> The transfer and generalization dimension examines the student 's ability to use a skill in more than one setting . To clarify , generalization settings are characterized as general education classrooms ( if the student spends most of the day in a resource or self-contained classroom ) , community based experiences where students received community-based instruction during school hours , or the home . Generalization has been noted as a critical dimension of instruction for students with significant disabilities ( Westling &; Fox , 2004 ) . Within the alternate assessment , this dimension is designed to assess generalization across settings only . <p> Benchmarks are measurable and observable gradelevel components of each content standard that could be used to develop student IEP goals . This dimension examines student work toward the achievement of benchmarks based upon school or district grade-level standards aligned with either of the two regular state assessments offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these assessments or another test as their general assessment under NCLB . <p> The use of adaptations dimension examines the student 's use of adaptations , modifications , and/or assistive technology , along with the level of independence evidenced by the student in using these supports . Adaptations are changes made to existing materials or instruction to meet the student 's needs , while modifications are substantial changes from the grade-level curriculum in what the student is expected to achieve . <p> The alternate assessment in this state counts toward reporting of assessment participation rates and proficiency at the state level . However , the alternate assessment is not considered to be " high-stakes " for students or schools . There are no consequences for students for low scores ( e.g. , failure to graduate ) , as well as no rewards or sanctions imposed at the school level by the state related to student alternate assessment scores . Thus , accountability for alternate assessment scores is at the state level only . Questions Guiding the Research <p> Three important questions guided this study : How does the alternate assessment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development for students with significant cognitive disabilities ? To what degree do teachers rate that influence upon daily instruction or IEP development as positive ? If the alternate assessment has no or negative influence on daily instruction or IEP development , what reasons do teachers give for negative or no influence ? <p> As we designed this study , we attempted to address several limitations of previous research . First , while former studies ( sec Towles-Reeves et al. , 2006 ; Towles-Reeves et al , in press ) had asked teachers about the extent of the influence of the alternate assessment , these studies had not asked teachers to identify whether that influence was positive or negative . Therefore , survey questions in the current study were structured to gather teachers ' perceptions of the influence on instruction and IEP development as positive , negative , or neutral . Second , when teachers responded that the alternate assessment , or specific dimensions of that assessment , had either a negative influence or no influence , another question probed the reason for that response . Third , more in-depth data to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-page demographics questionnaire attached to the survey . Anonymity was maintained , but a more precise description of the sample responding to the survey resulted . Method Instrumentation and Sample <p> During the 2004-2005 school year , the Alternate Assessment Portfolio Teacher Survey , which was used as the instrument for this study , went through multiple reviews with the state alternate assessment leadership team , consisting of special education teachers , district administrators , state staff , and specialists in autism , deaf-blindness , speech/language , assessment , and curriculum . The leadership team also identified ways to increase response rates , including placing the survey online , providing paper copies to teachers at trainings , and multiple , electronic reminders and encouragement from local personnel . <p> In March 2005 , an email , providing the survey and a link to the online version of the survey , was disseminated to all Area Education Agency ( AEA ) trainers . AEA trainers took paper copies of the surveys to teachers during scoring training and sent email copies to teachers through listserves . Only those teachers with a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited to participate . Teachers were allowed to complete the surveys online or through the paper version . An address was provided for teachers to return the survey directly to the researchers if they chose to do so . Teachers could also return the completed survey face down in a box prior to leaving scoring trainings . Teachers were given approximately one month to complete the survey . <p> The survey contained 2 sections : 1 section of 30 questions investigating the influence of the alternate assessment on instruction and IEP development along with a section of 21 demographic questions . The survey questions contained 20 forced choice responses and 10 Likert scale questions ranging from 1 ( low ) to 7 ( high ) . The demographic section of the survey contained 12 forced choice questions , 6 open response , and 3 Likert scale questions ranging from 1 ( low ) to 7 ( high ) . Data Analysis <p> All data were entered into SPSS Version 13.0 for analysis . Descriptive statistics ( means and frequencies ) were used to analyze the demographic data . Answers to survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Likert scaled questions . Additional inferential statistics ( i.e. , Pearson correlations ) investigated correlations between time spent compiling and assembling the portfolio and degree of positive influence of the alternate assessment on daily instruction . Also , we examined the correlation between time spent in training about the alternate assessment in the current school year and the degree of positive influence of the alternate assessment on daily instruction . Results Participants <p> A total of 261 teachers completed the survey , with a response rate of 65.3% ( out of a total of 400 teachers with students participating in the alternate assessment that year ) . Of these , 131 teachers returned the survey through the online site , and 130 teachers completed the paper version . Of those who responded , 221 teachers were female , 26 were male , and 14 did not indicate gender . The greatest number of respondents taught at the elementary ( N=105 ) level , with 56 high school and 46 middle school teachers responding . Others ( N =54 or 20.7% of all respondents ) taught across a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers in our survey taught across grade spans is probably indicative of the rural nature of the state . <p> Ninety-four teachers ( 36.0% ) had not completed a prior alternate assessment but were completing their first alternate assessment during that school year . As the survey was conducted in March , most of these teachers had nearly completed the entire alternate assessment process at the time of the survey , as assessments were due at the end of March . As a result , these teachers ' responses were included in the data analyses , as they would have been able to respond to each of the survey questions . Contrastingly , 103 respondents ( 39.5% ) had completed one to five alternate assessments over the past two years . A total of 88 respondents ( 33.7% ) said they would complete one alternate assessment during the survey year , while 54 ( 20.7% ) said they would complete two alternate assessments . Thirty-five teachers ( 13.4% ) reported they would complete three or four alternate assessments , and 20 teachers ( 7.7% ) said they would complete five or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report the amount of time spent developing the performance task for the portfolio . The majority of respondents ( N=134 or 51% ) said they spent between 0 and S hours developing the performance task ( or student activity ) represented in the portfolio . However , 33 respondents ( 12.6% ) reported they spent between 9 and 14 hours developing the performance task , and 47 respondents ( 18.0% ) said they spent more than 15 hours developing the performance task . The majority ( 63.2% ) said they spent 0 to 8 hours administering the assessment task , while 21 respondents ( 8.0% ) reported spending 9 to 14 hours administering the task , and 27 teachers ( 10.3% ) reported spending 15 or more hours administering the task . Finally , while 101 teachers ( 38.7% ) reported spending 0 to 8 hours assembling the portfolio , 33 teachers ( 12.6% ) reported spending 9 to 14 hours , and 77 ( 29.5% ) respondents said they spent more than 15 hours assembling the portfolio . All teachers reported spending time in training during the 2004-2005 school year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 hours ( 21 teachers , or 8.0% ) to 15 or more hours of training ( 62 teachers , or 25.3% ) . <p> Teachers were asked to rate the influence of the overall assessment and each dimension of the alternate assessment portfolio on daily instruction and IEP development . Very few respondents said the alternate assessment or any dimension of the alternate assessment had a negative impact on instruction or IEP development . Most notably , the highest frequency of negative impact responses reported by teachers was for the alternate assessment ( as a whole ) on daily instruction ( 16.1% ) . However , teachers consistently reported either positive influence or no influence on instruction and IEP development . See Table 1 for frequencies of the types of influence of the alternate assessment and each dimension of the assessment on IEP development and instruction . <p> When teachers responded that the alternate assessment , or a dimension of the assessment , positively influenced instruction or IEP development , they were then asked to rate that influence on a scale of one to seven ( one being low degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Table 2 outlines the mean influences of the assessment ( as a whole ) and each dimension of the assessment on IEP development and instruction . For the assessment as a whole and within every dimension of the assessment , the influence on instruction was rated more positively than the influence on IEP development . <p> Teachers were also asked to provide a reason for why they reported ( if they did so ) that the alternate assessment had a negative or no influence on instruction or IEP development . Overwhelmingly , teachers who responded this way indicated that they had always been doing what was required by the alternate assessment . Some teachers chose to answer this question with " other " and clarified by noting neither the alternate assessment , nor any assessment , was appropriate for the students they taught . Teachers also reported the amount of time and paperwork required made the alternate assessment difficult to complete . <p> Correlational analyses yielded no significant relationship between the amount of time spent selecting and assembling the performance task and degree of positive influence of the alternate assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found between the degree of positive influence of the alternate assessment on daily instruction and the amount of time teachers spent in training for the alternate assessment in the current school year ( r = .19 , p &lt; .05 ) . Discussion <p> There were three major research questions investigated in the current study : ( a ) How docs the alternate assessment portfolio and each dimension of the portfolio influence daily instruction or IEP development for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities within a largely rural state ; ( b ) To what degree does the alternate assessment positively influence daily instruction or IEP development ; and ( c ) If the alternate assessment has no influence or negative influence on daily instruction or IEP development , what reasons do teachers give to explain these phenomena ? We will outline the implications for each research question . Positive. , Negative , or Not at All <p> First , very few teachers reported a negative influence of the alternate assessment on instruction or IEP development . However , the number of teachers reporting positive influence ( N=116 , 44.4% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development was nearly matched by equal numbers of teachers reporting no influence ( N=101 , 38.7% ) of the alternate assessment upon these variables . The explanation for these findings may be related to the reason teachers reported negative or no influence : the most frequently given reason for negative or no influence was that teachers felt they had always been doing what was required by the assessment . <p> In addition , an unintended consequence of assessment is narrowing of curriculum and instruction to focus only on the specific learning outcomes assessed on the test ( Lane &; Stone , 2002 ) . It is quite possible that teachers are " teaching to the test . " As a result , their perceptions of the impact of the assessment on IEP development may be reduced if the IEP does not include the same skills as required by the assessment . <p> For the teachers in this survey , 44% reported positive impact on daily instruction . These data are similar to the findings of Flowers et al . ( 2005 ) , in which 36% of teachers in portfolio states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . also suggested that when teachers perceived alternate assessments to be a part of school accountability systems , more teachers reported a positive impact . As stated earlier , the alternate assessment is not considered to be " high-stakes " for students or schools . If it were a " high-stakes " assessment at the student or school level , more teachers may have perceived the assessment as positively influencing daily instruction and/or IEP development . <p> The assessment as a whole had a lower degree of positive influence on both daily instruction and IEP development than any of " its individual dimensions . There may be several reasons for this phenomenon . First , the " whole " is an abstract . Teachers can easily see the direct influence of each dimension on their daily instruction or IEP development . Interestingly , the use of adaptations dimension had a higher mean influence ( 4.65 and 4.61 on the 7 point scale , respectively ) on teachers ' daily instruction and IEP development than any other dimension . The adaptations dimension may have had a higher mean influence because the IEP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in assessment . As a result , teachers can sec the clear link between the assessment and the use of adaptations as prescriptively described on the IEP . Second , adaptations are easy to understand , see , and explain to other teachers and parents . Adaptations are concrete , and teachers are able to see students ' progress through the use of adaptations within the classroom and on assessments . Reasons for Negative or No Influence on nstruction and IEP Development <p> Of those teachers reporting no influence , many explained that they had always been doing what was required by the alternate assessment , so they had not made any changes to their daily instruction or IEP development . Prom a policy perspective , the number of teachers reporting no influence may be troublesome , as the time spent training and providing resources to teachers to implement the alternate assessment would hopefully reveal more teachers reporting a positive impact of the assessment on instruction and IEP development . Further , the teachers in this survey reported spending significant amounts of time in developing , administering , and assembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been devoted to other instructional tasks . Given the tremendous demands that are placed upon teachers , and especially upon teachers in rural areas who often have to serve very heterogeneous case loads of students ( Reck , 1990 ) , teachers ' perceptions that the expenditures of these resources have resulted in little or no impact upon the instruction of their students is a finding that requires further exploration . Correlations with Time/Training and Positive Influence on Daily Instruction <p> We used inferential statistics to investigate the correlation between time spent compiling and assembling the portfolio and degree of positive influence on the alternate assessment on daily instruction . We found no significant correlation . This echoes earlier findings ( Kampfer , Horvath , Kleinert , &; Kearns , 2001 ) suggesting time spent compiling an alternate assessment had no relationship with alternate assessment scores . It would thus appear that time spent in compiling the assessment may be unrelated to both the score and the impact of the assessment upon daily instruction . These results are important as teachers are overwhelmingly concerned about the time required for alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers should be taught efficient strategies for developing these assessments , and this study supports this . Finally , we examined the amount of time teachers spent in training on the alternate assessment during the current school year and degree of reported positive influence of the alternate assessment on daily instruction . Time in training was significantly correlated with the degree of perceived positive influence of the assessment on instruction . These results also support the findings of Flowers et al . ( 2005 ) , who noted training was necessary for teachers to address academic content standards in meaningful ways for students with significant cognitive disabilities . Limitations and Future Analyses <p> While this study did address limitations of previous research in this area ( i.e. , whether perceived influence was positive or negative , the reasons given for negative or no influence ) , several limitations still exist . First , this study only considered the perspectives of teachers . Future studies should replicate this work with administrators , local assessment coordinators , and parents of students taking the alternate assessment . A second limitation of the current study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data can be used to track changes based on implementation of new federal legislation within the state , and as a result of teacher support and professional development over time . A third limitation of this study is the need for a qualitative component to better understand what exactly about the alternate assessment or any of its dimensions positively influences instruction and/or IEP development . Researchers may assume that teachers are able to use alternate assessment results to change instruction or develop IEPs to produce more positive academic outcomes for students with significant cognitive disabilities , but there are no data to validate those assumptions . Fourth , this survey was completed in just one state and with one type of alternate assessment - we can not say with confidence that these results would generalize to other states or to alternate assessment formats . Implications for Practitioners <p> It would appear that alternate assessment has positively influenced teachers ' daily instruction , and to a lesser degree , the development of IEPs for students with significant cognitive disabilities . While a sizable number of respondents rated the alternate assessment as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IEP , for those respondents who did perceive an influence , far more rated that influence as positive than negative . However , it remains to be seen if NCLB 's focus on linkage to grade-level content standards for alternate assessments will result in a diminished focus on functional and life-skill instruction for students with significant cognitive disabilities ( see Collins et al. , 2005 ) . <p> This study also found no correlation between time spent selecting and compiling the portfolio and the perceived degree of influence of the alternate assessment on teachers ' daily instruction . These results support findings of other research on time devoted to completing alternate assessments ( Kampfer et al. , 2001 ) . While teachers have consistently reported an immense amount of time necessary to complete portfolios ( Flowers et al. , 2005 ; Kampfer et al. , 2001 ; Kleinert et al. , 1999 ) , and the current study also supported this finding , this may reflect teachers ' uncertainty on how to embed portfolio contents into the context of ongoing instruction linked to academic and grade-level standards . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate assessments into the context of daily instruction linked to grade level content standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities . This will be especially true as teachers must , under NCLB , conduct yearly alternate assessments in reading and math for their students in grades 3 through 8 , whereas most states to date ( including the state in which we conducted our survey ) have only required alternate assessments at selected grade levels ( e.g. , 4th , 8th , and 12th ) . <p> For teachers in rural areas , opportunities to receive both regular training and ongoing support on these new alternate assessments may require a greater focus on regionally based teacher work groups ; web-based , interactive video , and other forms of distance learning ; and summer institutes and workshops . We agree with Hager and Slocum ( 2005 ) that expert or mentor teachers , who have demonstrated proficiency in assisting students with significant disabilities achieve mastery of targeted skills on their state 's alternate assessment , could be recruited to support teachers in rural areas . We also agree with Hager and Slocum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of student work , effective instructional strategies and data collection methods , as well as opportunities for teachers to engage in professional development exchanges with their counterparts . Support for rural low incidence teachers , in an era of significant changes in curricular focus and increased demands for accountability in the context of those changes , is especially critical given the historical difficulty in recruiting qualified special educators ( Rosenkoetter , Irwin , &; Saceda , 2004 ) . <p> We also recognize that the yearly requirements for alternate assessments in both math and reading for students with significant cognitive disabilities in grades 3 through 8 will have a tremendous impact upon teachers in rural areas , especially as these assessments must now be linked to grade level content standards ( U.S. Department of Education , 2004 ) . For rural teachers , who often have very heterogeneous case loads of students ( Reck , 1990 ) , this requirement may well mean yearly alternate assessments in math and reading ( and for certain grades , in science ) for students across a broad band of grade levels . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knowledge of what is taught in these core subjects for their students with significant disabilities across a much greater breadth and scope of the curriculum than has been expected of teachers in the past . The training needs of teachers in this regard become paramount , if alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities are to truly have a positive impact upon their students ' educational outcomes . <p> We do know that training does make a difference . The correlation we found between teachers ' perceptions of the impact of alternate assessment upon instruction and the amount of training they received in their state 's alternate assessment accentuates the importance of support for teachers in ensuring that students with significant cognitive disabilities are not left behind as policymakers and practitioners rethink their expectations for all students . <p> * A copy of the survey is available upon request from the first author . <p> This manuscript was supported , in part , by the U.S. Department of Education Office of Special Education Programs ( Grant No .
