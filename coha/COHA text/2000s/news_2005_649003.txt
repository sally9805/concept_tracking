<p> On Tuesday , the day after Baltimore 's Miguel Tejada helped beat Minnesota with a home run , a double and a single , Twins Manager Ron Gardenhire sent his written lineup over to Orioles Manager Lee Mazzilli along with a verbal message . <p> " I told the clubhouse boy to tell him , ' Tejada looks kind of tired , why do n't you give him a rest ? " ' Gardenhire said with a smile . " I do n't think Lee was convinced . " How could he be ? Tejada has not missed a game since May 31 , 2000 , when he was with Oakland . <p> In his first at-bat in the second game of the series Tuesday , Tejada singled , then tagged up and took second on a fly ball to center , knocking over shortstop Jason Bartlett with a headfirst slide , not the behavior of a weary man . <p> And Wednesday afternoon , in his final at-bat of a 5-for-11 series , Tejada led off the bottom of the eighth with a double and scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orioles with a 22-11 record , second best in the American League behind the Chicago White Sox , whom they will visit for four games beginning Thursday night . <p> After Wednesday 's game , Tejada was leading the major leagues in runs batted in with 36 , and his batting average of .348 was fifth in the A.L . Baltimore is the fresh factor atop the American League East , leading the World Series champion Boston Red Sox by a game and a half and the Yankees by seven games . It is Tejada who is in charge of Baltimore 's resurgence and who will take the Orioles as far as they can go . <p> In his second season since arriving as a free agent from the Athletics , Tejada inspires and entertains his teammates with bilingual chatter and with an elaborate handshake ritual among infielders . Most of all , Tejada , a stocky 5-foot-9 shortstop , leads them by hitting with power and playing with unbridled joy and aggression . <p> Although Tejada has a six-year contract worth $72 million , he still displays the verve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic in 1993 by the Hall of Famer Juan Marichal , who was working as a scout for the Athletics . Tejada said the Mets saw him , too , but declined to offer him employment . <p> After he won the Most Valuable Player award for Oakland in 2002 , the A 's could not afford to keep him when his contract expired after the 2003 season . <p> " I came here because I knew this team would be a good team in the future , " Tejada said . " I give all my teammates a lot of energy and a lot of pride to come to the field every night and be a winner . " <p> Despite his exploits in Oakland , Tejada has not had a high profile among casual baseball fans because he played on a West Coast team for his first seven seasons , which meant a lot of games ending after midnight in the East . The move east will change that , particularly if the Orioles can find their way to the postseason , where Tejada appeared four times with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tejada says he enjoys the new location . <p> " You play the Yankees and Boston more , " Tejada said . " They 're always in the playoffs . They 're big-market teams . You 're on the TV more and people recognize you more . You play earlier . " <p> He does not mind the extra visits to places like Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park . " I love it , I love it , " Tejada said . " You see a lot of fans , those ballparks are always full . I know a lot of good baseball players have sat in these clubhouses . You play on the same fields that Babe Ruth played , and Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams . " <p> Tejada is making some of his own history . His home run Monday was the 200th of his career , and he has driven in more than 100 runs for five straight seasons . If he plays in 10 more games in succession , his consecutive-game streak will reach 799 and he will pass Nellie Fox for 10th place on baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is Cal Ripken , the former Orioles shortstop , with 2,632 consecutive games . Tejada 's streak is the longest among active players . <p> His endurance is in contrast to the fragility of some teammates . On Tuesday night , right fielder Sammy Sosa was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a staph infection . Less than an hour later , center fielder Luis Matos was sidelined for six weeks when he broke a finger while trying to bunt . Mazzilli was discouraged . <p> " If you lose a Hall of Famer , how would you feel ? " Mazzilli said , referring to Sosa . " It could be serious . " <p> The developments left the clubhouse somewhat subdued . The day before , Mazzilli said he was pleased by the spirit of his players and noted that he often saw a cluster of them talking baseball after games and groups of them gathering for dinner on the road . <p> " You do n't see that much nowadays , " Mazzilli said . " Tejada changed this team when he came . We knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tejada . " <p> Tejada seems willing to promote both his sport and a team that is still drawing modest crowds at Camden Yards despite discounted tickets and a great start to the season . When a Japanese television crew approached Tejada in the dugout with a request Tuesday , Tejada accepted and donned a T-shirt with Japanese writing that translated to " No Running Away . " <p> In the Orioles ' clubhouse , Tejada occupies the command position of a star , directly in the center of the main wall of lockers . To his left is a space that is empty except for a stereo , an influential piece of atmospheric equipment among men who spend many idle hours together . <p> To Tejada 's right are two empty lockers , then Sosa 's . On the shelf above Tejada 's clothing is a large picture of his wife and two children . His daughter is 5 years old and his son is 3 . <p> Down the row from Tejada is the locker of Melvin Mora , the third baseman whose two errors led to two Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's game , in warm-ups , Tejada tossed balls next to Mora and talked to him with animation . <p> " He 's happy every day , " Mora said . " I like the guys with good attitude . He 's never mad , except when he misses the ball . He gives energy to everybody . " <p> Mora and Tejada have developed a ritualistic handshake , which involves almost a dozen moves and looks like a dance . <p> Also getting in on this act is Brian Roberts , the second baseman , who is batting .370 , best on the team among regular players , and has 10 home runs , tied for the team lead with Tejada . Together , Tejada and Roberts are providing power from the middle of the infield reminiscent of what Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker did in Detroit in the 1980 's . <p> " He 's hysterical , he 's crazy , he 's fun , he 's just somebody you want to be around , " Roberts said of Tejada . When asked if talent , money and fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He knows where he came from . " <p> Tejada 's home in the Dominican Republic was destroyed by a hurricane when he was 3 , and his mother died on Christmas Day when he was 13 . Among other jobs , he shined shoes , and he left school to help support his family . <p> When Tejada arrived in Baltimore , he announced , " This is not a losing team anymore , " even though the Orioles had not had a winning season since 1997 . Last season , Tejada led the majors in runs batted in with 150 , and after six fourth-place finishes , he nudged the Orioles into third place with an improved 78-84 record . <p> " He would tell us that he believed in us and that we were a good team , even though we probably were n't as good as we needed to be , " Roberts said . " I do n't even remember what this team was like before he was here . " <p> Sometimes , Tejada plays with a recklessness that would get lesser players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tejada ran around third base and scored the winning run despite a stop sign from the coach Tom Trebelhorn . <p> Tejada , who will turn 29 on May 25 , is an elder on a relatively young team . Despite their early success , the Orioles lack some polish . In the last five games , they have made 11 errors , including three Wednesday . <p> After the game Wednesday , Tejada admitted he was getting tired late in day games that come after night games . " So I do n't try to do too much , " he said . " That 's why I hit a double , " he added in reference to his big eighth-inning hit . <p> The hit helped make a winning pitcher out of Sidney Ponson , who said after the game that Tejada " brings fire to everybody . " <p> " He makes everybody play harder than they 're capable of doing , " Ponson said . " He gets the best out of me . " <p> Mazzilli , asked about Gardenhire 's advice to rest Tejada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will , come October . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Miguel Tejada has 10 homers this season .
