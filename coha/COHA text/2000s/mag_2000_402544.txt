According to advertising guru James Twitchell , every symbol , from alka-seltzer 's speedy to the energizer bunny , plants powerful notions of who we are <p> Along with two friends who need a new plastic dish drainer , James Twitchell , professor of 19th-century poetry at the University of Florida in Gainesville , is visiting a Wal-Mart . Twitchell gazes raptly upon the aisles stacked with TV sets in boxes , and picnic baskets and T-shirts and beach balls . So much mass-produced stuff ! Twitchell is energized-as any dedicated scholar would be upon entering an archive packed with new material . <p> " Look at this wire shopping cart-it 's the equivalent of the Las Vegas poker chip , " he says . " In a casino , instead of gambling with your real money , you use little colored plastic disks , so it seems OK . This huge cart is something like that : it 's so roomy you do n't feel you 're buying too much . Marketers fooled around with the size of these carts , getting them just right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that he has switched from teaching and writing solely about Romantic-era poetry to buzzier issues , such as adolescents wearing dungarees slung low to reveal their Joe Boxers , and whether the Jolly Green Giant is an avatar of Zeus . And now , reveling in all these bedspreads and CD players and croquet sets and yellow raincoats , Twitchell tells his friends that one reason he began studying such fine points of mass marketing is that his parents , long ago , denied him Wonder Bread . <p> Twitchell 's father , a Vermont physician , dismissed Wonder Bread as " air and water . " His mother warned that Coca-Cola was sugar water that would " rot your teeth . " Now he keeps a cellophane-wrapped loaf of Wonder Bread and an aluminum can of Coke-icons among American consumables-atop his computer monitor . In one of Twitchell 's recent books , Lead Us Into Temptation : The Triumph of American Materialism , he wrote that everything he loved as a youth was from the forbidden mass culture : " It was mass produced , mass marketed and consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepsi and Whoppers and Dairy Queen sundaes , he had to do it on the sly , " for we would not countenance them inside the family circle . " <p> Twitchell-who is now in his 50s , trim and urbane-says his study of mass culture , especially advertising , began 15 years ago , when he was teaching a class on the Romantic poets . " I suddenly realized my students had no interest in what I had to say . " He asked them to complete a line from Wordsworth : " My heart leaps up when I behold a in the sky . " Nobody could supply the missing " rainbow , " but his students could flawlessly recite the contents of a Big Mac : two all-beef patties , special sauce , lettuce , cheese , pickles and onions on a sesame-seed bun . <p> " It was an epiphany , " he says . <p> At the time , the much-discussed book by E. D. Hirsch , et al. , Cultural Literacy : What Every American Needs To Know , argued that cultures need the glue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beirut is . " I realized he was right , we do need a body of information , " explains Twitchell . " But he was wrong about what body of information we share , because it is n't from high culture-it 's from pop culture , the world my students knew so well . " His students knew little about Dickens or Keats . " But they could recite the ' Mmm , mmm good ' Campbell 's Soup jingle , " he says . " They did n't know Rembrandt , but they could tell you Ben 's and Jerry 's last names . " Twitchell was stunned . " I wanted to know why the stuff they knew was so powerful it pushed my stuff out of the way . " <p> Since then , he has been observing himself , his law professor wife , his two daughters , now grown , his colleagues , students , neighbors . He has invited himself into advertising agencies as an academic gadfly on the wall . He has explored advertising 's history . And he has learned the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus flanks to messages over the telephone as the caller waits on hold . He has probed the impact of all that mass marketing in such works as ADCULTUSA and his latest book , Twenty Ads That Shook the World . <p> Academics usually excoriate modern materialism as spiritually deadening and socially corrupting , he observes . " My own take is that humans love things , and we 've always been materialistic , but until the Industrial Revolution only the wealthy had things-now the rest of us are having a go at arranging our lives around things . " Especially in the past 20 years , young people have had lots more money to spend . " Now they 're driving the market for mass-produced objects . " And especially for youths , Twitchell maintains , advertising has become our social studies text . " Ask 18-year-olds what freedom means , and they 'll tell you , ' It means being able to buy whatever I want ! ' " <p> But advertising 's job is not just urging , " Buy this ! " Twitchell cites 1950s ad ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hammer clangs an anvil to remind viewers how a headache feels ( or maybe to induce one ) while reporting good news : Anacin is " for fast , Fast , FAST relief .... " Reeves would hold up two quarters . It was advertising 's task , he said , to make you believe those two quarters were different . Even more important , the ad had to persuade you that one of those quarters was worth more . <p> To illustrate the process , Twitchell points to 1930s ads claiming Schlitz steam-cleaned its beer bottles . What the ads omitted was that all brewers steam-cleaned their bottles . Thus , through advertising , the company achieved " ownership " of product purity-it created for itself what the ad industry calls a USP ( Unique Selling Proposition ) . <p> According to Twitchell , it was in the Victorian era that mass culture reared up , driven by the steam-powered printing press , which spewed out text and images and notions for the " mob . " Victorians invented the word " mob , " he says , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . " Victorian education strove to differentiate literature from pulp novels , to show classical music 's superiority to dance-hall tunes , to instill " art appreciation . " But with the machine age churning out cheap goods , consumerism was erupting all over , and so was advertising . <p> Thomas J. Barratt , the 19th-century manufacturer of Pears ' Soap , noted : " Any fool can make soap . It takes a clever man to sell it . " And Barratt was just that man . " The manufacture of soap is a turning point in civilization , " says Twitchell . Originally , farmers boiled animal fats with wood ashes and molded the result into soap balls , which soon stank . With the machine age came soap concocted from caustic soda and vegetable fats , pressed into bars that lasted forever . But one soap was much like another . <p> In 1881 , at James Gamble 's soap factory in Cincinnati , a worker forgot to turn off the mixing machinery , inadvertently producing a batch of soap so air-filled it floated . Gamble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pure-in fact , 99 44/100 percent pure . <p> Earlier , England 's Andrew Pears-the father-in-law of Thomas J. Barratt-had developed a translucent soap . It seemed a natural to appeal to the class-conscious Briton 's desire for whiter skin , versus a laborer 's weathered tan . Barratt got the message across in such ways as plastering his company 's new slogan , an early version of Nike 's " Just Do It , " on walls all over the British Empire : " Good Morning ! Have You Used Your Pears ' Soap ? " <p> But Barratt 's greatest coup was co-opting Bubbles , a John Everett Millais painting of the artist 's angelic grandson watching a just-blown soap bubble waft upward . Barratt sold Millais on the notion that , distributed as a free poster , his painting would reach thousands upon thousands of potential new art lovers , for their edification . For their further edification , Barratt had a cake of the soap lying in the painting 's foreground , inscribed " Pears ' . " <p> Branding made advertising possible . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nails , it came in barrels , and to get some , you told the store clerk , " Two bars of soap , please . " By the late 1800snudged by Barratt 's advertising-you might specify Pears ' Soap . <p> Twitchell says Barratt 's hijacking of art to sell soap " blurred , for the first time and forevermore , the bright line between art and advertising , between high culture and the vulgar , between pristine and corrupt . " Today , art co-opted by advertising is so commonplace we do not blink at Michelangelo 's David wearing Levi 's cutoffs . <p> Back in the Wal-Mart , Twitchell veers toward a barrel displaying kitchen floor mats . " Two for five dollars ! " he says , reading a sign . It is clearly tempting . Two floor mats , one price . But he pulls himself away from the alluring floor mats to ruminate about literature . " I 'm supposed to teach English Romantic poetry , " he says . " That period , the beginning of the 19th century , is where many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when the Industrial Revolution began producing the surfeit of things that will cause the trouble . " <p> Surpluses produced by the new technologies , like steam power , were particularly apt to pile up after wars , and that was especially true in the aftermath of the Civil War . " What it takes to win a war is the ability to produce more war materials than your opponent , but when the war ends you have too many blankets , boots , rifles , and too much patent medicine-which was the subject of the first real advertising , " he explains . " In the 1870s we had the rise of advertising , along with the rise of newspapers , and now we start talking about two nostrums or two pairs of boots as if they were different , when we know they are the same . " <p> Modern advertising , Twitchell insists , learned its stuff from religion . " I grew up a Vermont Congregationalist . My father was a doctor in our town , and his father had been a doctor in our town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Revolution . " His was , except for Wonder Bread denial , a stable life . " In the world where I grew up , you knew wh0 you were by a series of time-tested anchors-ancestry , land , religion , where you went to school , your accent , your job-but we 've been rapidly losing those anchors , " he argues . " One marriage out of two ends in divorce , the average person changes jobs seven or eight times during a lifetime . " With the old determinants of social position shifting or gone , he says , " we 're starting to build our identity around driving a Lexus or displaying Ralph Lauren 's polo player on our shirt . " <p> He notes that many of modern advertising 's founders had religious backgrounds . A Baptist minister 's son , Bruce Barton , cofounded the large ad agency Batten , Barton , Durstine &; Osborne ( which comedian Fred Allen suggested sounded like " a trunk falling downstairs " ) . Artemas Ward , who wrote psalms to Sapolio Soap , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing genius helped create the modern department store , once considered becoming a Presbyterian minister . Rosser Reeves , creator of the Anacin anvils , was the son of a Methodist minister . <p> Twitchell contends that these founders of modern advertising , and others like them , modeled their messages on parables they heard in church . He sketches a typical TV commercial in which someone is distressed . Perhaps it is a young woman , if the product is a dish detergent . Perhaps it is a middle-aged man , if the product is a cold remedy . The heroine or hero consults another person who gives witness : a certain product " works miracles . " The product is tried . Relief ! Ads create and then promise to absolve you of secular sins , such as halitosis or dandruff , or " ring around the collar " or " dishpan hands . " <p> But Twitchell says that advertising also reaches back to paganism . Instead of Zeus in the clouds and dryads in trees , we have televisions that are inhabited by the Jolly Green Giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother Nature , Aunt Jemima , the White Knight , the Energizer Bunny and Speedy Alka-Seltzer with his magical chant : " Plop , plop , fizz , fizz .... " <p> Commercial culture is so potent , Twitchell believes , that it has " colonized " society . For instance , Christmas was low-key until the 1800s , when stores reinvented the holiday to sell off their surpluses . On December 24 , 1867 , R. H. Macy kept his Manhattan store open until midnight , setting a one-day sales record of more than $6,000 . <p> Santa started as " a weird conflation of St. Nicholas ( a down-on-his-luck nobleman who helped young women turn away from prostitution ) and Kriss Kringle ( perhaps a corruption of the German Christkindl , a gift giver ) . " Today 's familiar Santa , Twitchell continues , originated in the 1930s , because Coca-Cola 's sales slumped in winter . Ads began showing Santa-in his modern persona-relaxing in a living room after toy delivery , quaffing a Coke apparently left for him by the home 's children . " Coke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own Christmas . " <p> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was a 1930s creation of a Montgomery Ward copywriter . And Twitchell says Kodak ads universalized the tradition of blowing out birthday-cake candles and other " Kodak Moments " to " show what you can do with fast Kodak film and the Kodak Flashmatic attachment on your Kodak camera . " <p> Ads have even changed our attitude toward debt , which once could lead to prison . " Think only of how consumer debt was merchandised until it became an accepted habit , not an abhorred practice , " observes Twitchell . " Think only of how the concept of shineand ' new and improved ' replaced the previous value of patina and heirloom . " Twitchell says politics hit its modern ad-driven stride starting with the 1952 " Eisenhower Answers America " Presidential campaign , designed by Rosser Reeves . Regarding his own ads , Ike said ruefully : " To think an old soldier should come to this . " <p> Athletes have become logo-bedecked living billboards . But Twitchell argues that commercial culture has affected us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast . " Before Messrs . Post and Kellogg , this meal consisted of breaking fast by finishing last night 's dinner , " he says , adding that leftovers went to the family dog . Dog food was a creation of Ralston Purina 's ad agency . Twitchell says that some marketing ploys fizzled , of course , citing an old ad headlined : " Sunday is Puffed Grain Day . " <p> Mother 's Day began in the early 1900s when Philadelphia merchandiser John Wanamaker elevated to stardom a local woman mourning for her mother . He ran full-page ads in the Philadelphia Inquirer . Soon only a blackguard would fail to buy Mom a present on her newly special day . Wanamaker reportedly gloated that he would rather be the founder of Mother 's Day than the king of England . <p> Twitchell is no longer amazed that his students , inundated with commercial messages , display their status with manufacturers ' logos on their shirt pockets or on their sunglasses . " At a Palm Beach store a woman explained to me that the more expensive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cartier you can barely see the Cy " His students derogatorily refer to certain classmates as " Gaps , " after the retail chain where they buy their clothes . In the 19th century , people learned manners from novels and magazines ; in the 20th from sitcoms and ads . When his daughter was a teenager , he heard her telling friends , after watching a teen TV show , 90210 , " Can you believe how cool Kelly looked in Dylan 's Porsche ! " Twitchell shrugs : " That 's all they have for Trollope . " <p> Economist Thorstein Veblen coined the term " conspicuous consumption " : displaying possessions to impress others . " Between ages 15 and 25 , we males consume the most as a percentage of our disposable income because we 're displaying our feathers to potential mates , " says Twitchell . " Now it 's more complicated because females are working and they can display too . " But the urge wanes . " After about age 45 , many people start moving away from acquisition . Thus , ads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid-for product placements , concentrate ferociously on youths , who seem to get the message . <p> But not all analysts agree with Madison Avenue 's youth fixation . In fact , according to Beth Barnes , an associate professor at Syracuse University and chair of the advertising department at the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications , advertisers ae increasingly recognizing that the over-45 age-group is growing fast . And older Americans often have the magic ingredient : disposable income . " I think the change is slow , but inevitable , " Barnes says . For one thing , she notes , advertising is increasingly segmented , exploiting today 's highly segmented media to aim fine-tuned messages at specific subcultures , including age-groups . " Advertising for soft drinks may stay aimed at youth , " she says . " But the trick is to go after older people with products in which they are not set in their ways-computers , for instance , or travel and tourism , or financial services , or new products , like Chrysler 's PT Cruiser . " <p> About a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-45 on-line shoppers . " It makes sense . They 're amazingly machine savvy-my mother just got a new computer because her old one was too slow . " <p> It is true , Barnes continues , that younger people may be less loyal to brands , and easier to woo away . But she adds : " There 's a flip side to that-young people are lot more skeptical too ! " <p> Perhaps . " Why , " asks James Twitchell , " are my daughters willing to buy a bottle of water worth two cents and pay $1.50 ? " They are n't buying the product itself ; they 're buying the values that advertising has attached to the product , such as being hip . He cites a Madison Avenue adage : " You do n't drink the beer ; you drink the advertising . " <p> Many of today 's ads leave the average reader or viewer totally confused about what is being sold . For instance , in one current TV commercial , a cool young couple is driving down a city street , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , they notice that the passing scene is rife with tempos , such as a boy bouncing a basketball , all in perfect sync with the rhythmic clack of their windshield wipers . What is going on ? <p> " Often advertising is not about keeping up with the Joneses , but about separating you from them , " Twitchell points out . " That 's especially true of advertising directed at a particular group , such as adolescents or young-adult males-it 's called ' dog-whistle ' advertising because it goes out at frequencies only dogs can hear . " In this case , the " dogs " are the commercial 's target group of young adults . The young couple is hip enough to be driving their model of Volkswagen . " The idea is , your parents ca n't understand this , but you can . " He cites a recent advertisement for a new sport utility vehicle that actually has the headline : " Ditch the Joneses ! " <p> The most egregious example of this oblique marketing ploy was , of course , Benetton 's spate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create product recognition . The image of a nun and a priest , locked in a passionate kiss , was offensive to many people . But the pieces de resistance were Benetton 's portraits of 25 death row inmates in America 's prisons . This ad campaign cost Benetton its lucrative contract with Sears , Roebuck &; Company and ended Oliviero Toscani 's 18-year career as Benetton 's creative director . <p> Such an ad may look senseless to a 50-year-old , Twitchell says , " but it 's being properly decoded by a 23-year-old . " It works . Today 's average American consumes twice as many goods and services as in 1950 , and the average home is twice as large as a post-World War II average home . A decade ago , most grocery stores stocked about 9,000 items ; today 's stores carry some 24,000 . <p> Twitchell says he does not believe for a minute that our commercial society is a better world . " But it might be a safer world , oddly enough , if we value machine-made objects about which lies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " And we may be moving into a quieter world as people who were never able to consume before begin getting and spending . " <p> He points upward , to the Wal-Mart 's ceiling , with its exposed girders , pipes , wires and ducts , painted industrial gray . " That 's to give you the illusion that you 're buying stuff as close to the factory as possible , " he says . His eyes fix upon Kraft Macaroni &; Cheese boxes , each inscribed " The Cheesiest . " He says , " It looks like a cornucopia , and the message is , ' Take one ! ' And see , the stack still sits on its freight pallet , to give you the idea there are n't many middlemen between you and the factory price . " <p> Everything in the store is a brand-name product . " See , a stack of Fedders ' air conditioners in their boxes . It was Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton 's great insight that if he sold only branded items and negotiated lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " <p> Twitchell wanders back to the alluring display of floor mats that had first attracted his eye . He stares , transfixed . " Two for five dollars ! I came in here meaning to buy one . That idea of two seemingly for the price of one took hold in the 1940s , especially with Alka-Seltzer , which you originally took as only one tablet until they halved the dosage so you 'd take two : ' Plop , plop .... ' " <p> A few steps farther , he eyes a display of bottled mineral water . " This one is made by Pepsi . When they studied its marketing in Wichita , they were astonished to find out that buyers of these lower-priced mineral waters did n't care if it came from underground springs or runoff from Alpine glaciers-they bought the water because they liked the name and the feel of the bottle in their hand . " <p> He pauses at a rack of greeting cards . " It 's how we exchange emotions now , the commercializing of expression . The most touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy because their parents just got divorced . " Such cards perform a useful service . " They 're facilitators of difficulty , and they help us handle emotionally fraught events quickly and efficiently . " <p> As his friends prepare to leave the Wal-Mart , without the dish drainer they had sought , Twitchell stops . " I 'm going to go buy those two floor mats , but after you leave , because I 'm ashamed to be seen succumbing to that two-for-the-price-of-one deal , " he says . <p> Even so , Twitchell-deprived as a boy of Wonder Bread and Coke-believes the stuff cramming our stores , which advertisements strain to get us to buy , is not necessarily invidious to our cultural health . " After all , " he says , " we do n't call them ' bads ' - we call them ' goods !
