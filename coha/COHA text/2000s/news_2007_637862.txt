<p> THE probing about his Mormon beliefs has by now become familiar to the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney . But when Mary Van Steenis , a teacher at a local Christian school , took the microphone at a recent " Ask Mitt Anything " forum in Pella , Iowa , to ask her question , it still felt as if some sort of unspoken boundary of social etiquette had been breached . <p> Mrs. Van Steenis wanted Mr. Romney to say where the Book of Mormon would figure in his decision making as president . <p> " Where would the Bible be ? " she asked . " Would it be above the Book of the Mormon , or would it be beneath it ? " <p> Although the Constitution bars any religious test for office , if polls are to be believed , Mr. Romney , the former Massachusetts governor , faces a serious obstacle to winning the presidency because of his faith . Surveys show a substantial percentage of Americans would be less likely to vote for a Mormon , or for that matter a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment ? Graph <p> The answer , of course , is complicated . Historical precedent and other polling information offer clues that many voters are willing to make at least certain concessions when it comes to a candidate 's religious observance when they pull the curtain behind them in the voting booth . <p> But could voters accept a president who believes in the Book of Mormon ? What about one who believes in the Old Testament but not the New ? Or one who venerates Muhammad , or Buddha ? <p> There does seem to be at least one bottom line for many voters : belief in God . <p> " This is a deeply religious nation by many standards , " said Mark Rozell , a professor of public policy at George Mason University . " They want their leaders to be believers . They want them to believe in something higher , to have a moral framework as they lead the country . " <p> Indeed , the religion test imposed by voters has evolved over the years , said John C. Green , a senior fellow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As has been widely noted , Mr. Romney 's situation has parallels to John F. Kennedy 's in 1960 . In 1928 , pervasive anti-Catholic sentiment helped derail Al Smith 's bid for the presidency . Several decades later , however , Kennedy managed to turn back similar questions , declaring before a gathering of Southern Baptist ministers in Houston that he would resign from public office if there were ever a conflict between his religion and the national interest . <p> Kennedy 's decision to confront the issue directly helped alleviate the fears of many Protestants . Mr. Romney 's aides said he was now weighing whether to do something similar . <p> Polls in recent years have shown a clear shift in religious considerations . The vast majority of Americans at this point , said Mr. Green , care less about sectarian affiliation , at least among members of faiths that are now perceived to be part of the American mainstream  --  Protestants , Catholics and most recently Jews  --  and more generally about whether the candidate believes in God and how that lends itself to a moral framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Pew Research Center asked which traits , including being black , a woman , a Mormon , a Muslim , or a homosexual , would help or hurt a candidate the most . The worst trait for a candidate to possess ? " Does n't believe in God . " <p> The basic standard might help explain why the Republican frontrunner in national polls , Rudolph W. Giuliani , a divorced Roman Catholic who favors abortion rights and has studiously sidestepped questions about his spiritual beliefs and church attendance , is still faring well among many evangelical Christians . <p> Even though little is known about his spiritual practices , Mr. Giuliani , who grew up attending Catholic schools and even considered being a priest at one point , is at least a part of a mainstream church . He has also sought to demonstrate something of a moral backbone by sticking to his stance on abortion , despite its unpopularity among the Republican base . <p> When Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut , an observant Jew , became the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatives liked his championing of religious values in the public square but voted overwhelmingly for the Bush-Cheney ticket anyway . <p> Skepticism persists , however , about those who belong to certain religious minorities . The Pew survey , for example , found 46 percent would be less likely to vote for a Muslim presidential candidate . <p> Nevertheless , the 110th Congress , which took office this year , included for the first time , two Buddhists and a Muslim . <p> An important part of overcoming the suspicions of voters , said Keith Ellison , a Minnesota Democrat and the only Muslim ever elected to Congress , is to allow them to get to know the candidate as an individual . <p> " Could we elect a Muslim , or a Mormon , or someone from any other minority religion , is a different question from , ' Could we elect Keith Ellison to represent the Fifth Congressional District , ' " Mr. Ellison said . " Could we elect Mitt Romney ? He 's a Mormon , but it 's not the only thing there is about Mitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mormonism informs him , but he is fundamentally an individual . I think people are going to get that . " <p> Mormons at this point only represent about 1.5 percent of the population . In the Pew survey , 30 percent of respondents said they would be less likely to vote for a Mormon candidate . <p> When challenged about his beliefs , Mr. Romney has sought to emphasize points of commonality with Protestants and Catholics , often asserting that he considers Jesus Christ his lord and savior . <p> But Charles W. Dunn , dean of the school of government at Regent University , founded by the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson , advised caution on this approach . <p> " That does n't play well with let 's say an evangelical audience , " he said . " Doctrinally , they understand , ' No , we do n't worship the same God . We do n't have the same approach . ' " <p> Instead , he said , like Kennedy before him , Mr. Romney should seek to emphasize religious tolerance . Indeed , Mr. Romney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " This is a nation where people come from different faiths , different doctrines , different churches , " Mr. Romney said . " But , unlike the people we 're fighting over in the Middle East , we do n't have a religious test to say who should be able to run our country . It 's over there where people say , ' You do n't go to my church , you ca n't run our country . ' " <p> When he finished , his audience applauded . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com " Changes In Congress " Here are the religious affiliations of the 535 members of Congress elected in 1964 and 2006 , as self-reported .
