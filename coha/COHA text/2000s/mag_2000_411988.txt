A cry in the night , then silence , and suddenly the wilderness is wilder and forever a part of you . // The scream rushes out of the forest , echoing off the mountains and searing my eardrums . My gut response tells me a woman is in trouble and needs help . Reason reminds me that I 'm on a remote mountain miles from other humans . I stare into the dark , not sure if I really want to know what 's out there . The screech quickly fades into the pines , and the deep , silence returns . The long shadows that went unnoticed before now seem alive as they slither through camp . There 's a motion , something in the trees-or am I imagining it ? The peaceful , solemn night has suddenly gone wild . I try to relax as I peer into the dark toward the direction of the cry . Could there really be a woman screaming out here ? Whatever made the sound-she , he , it-is close . Before I can move , the screech comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human . My husband , Mark , reminds me that our camp is deep in a west Texas mountain range that 's a refuge for coyotes , mountain lions , black bears , and elk . We 'd spent the day trudging up a steep , waterless mountainside pounded by 40 mph wind gusts to get here , to be far from people . The wind . Maybe it 's just the wind . But then my ears betray my logic : I hear no wind . We huddle closer in the dark . From somewhere a little south of the cry , we hear a squeaky yip , a pause , then another yip . A small , young creature yips a dozen or so more times as Mark and I stare at each other . " Prey would n't call attention to itself like that , " I say , thinking the scream might be the battle cry of some hungry hunter . " Unless it 's dying , " he suggests . The yip comes again , softly . Gradually , it dawns on us that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I close my eyes and imagine ; perhaps she 's introducing her cub to the hunt , or licking the cub 's twitching ears , then raising her tawny head to peer west , toward us . Maybe , like me , she leans toward the foreign sounds and smells of some unknown creature , wondering if she should investigate . The next morning , we tumble out of the tent to blue skies and a windless day . The air is crisp and nips at fingers and noses as we shoulder our packs . With every step , we search for puma prints , walking slowly along the dry , rocky trail . At a dusty stream bed , I veer off , following a route that looks like one evening hunters would use . I search for soft mud that would capture and hold prints . I even catch myself sniffing and assuming a stalking stance , as if the possibility of seeing a mountain lion has brought out my own animalistic senses . I know what to look for . A few years ago in the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints semicircled atop a trapezoidal heel pad . The absence of claw marks eliminated canines . The 4-inch width made for an impossibly large coyote , anyway . I knew what had made the print , and I knew it was nearby . The trail was dusty and the day windy-perfect conditions for obscuring and erasing old tracks . This one was perfect and crisp , and told me I was on the animal 's trail . Maybe he was patrolling his territory , keeping an eye on visitors like me . This west Texas cat , though , is more elusive . Finding no tracks , we abandon the hunt and pick up the pace . We settle in to a leisurely hike , the only surprise coming when we startle a few wild turkeys strutting through the trees . Miles later , we stumble across a sign more obvious than any paw print . Tawny fur peeks out from between wintertrampled grasses , and the rank smell of rot and death hangs in the air . The dull brown coat is streaked with blackened , dried blood , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive antlers is skewed at a disturbing angle . Years of grizzly country hiking have taught me that when you find a dead elk in this condition , you get out of there fast . But I 'm in Texas now , which muffles my common sense and fear . I glance around for signs of predators , then move in for a look . " Do n't get too close , " Mark says as he catches my arm . He 's aware of my fascination with the raw , life-and-death struggles that occur in the wilderness . The body is desiccated , so I 'm not too worried about interrupting someone 's recent dinner . I pick up a stick to show my leery husband I do n't plan to tear into the carcass with bare hands . The neck is ravaged , more from weather than a predator . I lift up peeling scraps of dried hide on the torso , searching for clues , then find the answer in the form of a gaping hole in the rib cage area . Mountain lions go for the lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter , maybe the same mountain lion we heard last night sated herself with an elk weakened by hunger or thirst or illness . Maybe she set an example for her young one about the rules of the wild : Stay tough , stay strong , or die . After a moment , we continue our hike out , pausing at the last ridge crest to look out over the dry , crimson-and-maize landscape . From high in the mountains , the desert stretches to the horizon . We drop the final 2,000 feet in just a mile and a half , scrambling down a cleft cut through the mountain range 's spine and out onto the desert floor . As we wind around the final hill and begin to see signs of human habitation , I feel as if I 'm walking through a gate from the wild world into a tame place . Then I notice it , something I have n't sensed when heading home from other trips : A little piece of wilderness is coming out of the mountains with me , echoing in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
