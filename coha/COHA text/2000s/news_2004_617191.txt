<p> Presidential candidates : Responses to Cynthia Tucker 's column " Candidates inspire disdain , " @issue , Jan. 4 <p> Want inspiration ? Listen to Bush <p> President Bush had the vision and raw courage to invade Iraq , depose a flagitious dictator and set our country on " a new policy , a forward strategy of freedom in the Middle East . " He characterizes the advance of freedom as " the calling of our time . . . the calling of our country . " He states that our commitment to democracy is being tested in Cuba , Burma , North Korea and Zimbabwe , and he states , in the spirit of President John F. Kennedy , that we will stand with these oppressed peoples until the day of their freedom finally arrives . That is enough inspiration for me and my vote . <p> DENNIS BALLOU , Atlanta <p> For this voter , Clark is the one <p> Cynthia Tucker claims not to see a candidate worthy of inspiration or someone who is a uniter and not a divider . She clearly has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one candidate who can beat George W. Bush . <p> His principles coincide exactly with the Democratic ideals : He is pro-choice , pro-affirmative action , pro-environment and was against the war in Iraq . <p> DAWSON DEVITT , Ball Ground <p> As leaders lead , Tucker just talks <p> And exactly what has Cynthia Tucker done for her country  --  besides devoting a lifetime to ripping white conservative political leaders , including presidents , for a living ? <p> Real leaders lead , equitably , without malice and discrimination , and with objectivity , truth and justice . Tucker has none of these attributes whatsoever . <p> EDWARD G. ROBINSON , Smyrna <p> Time might alter our view of JFK <p> Cynthia Tucker extolled the virtues of John F. Kennedy compared to George W. Bush and his challengers  --  but how would JFK be viewed today ? <p> He oversaw a botched invasion of Cuba and then stood toe-to-toe with the Soviet Union , pushing the risk of a nuclear exchange to the brink in the Cuban missile crisis . Would he be seen today as a Texas-style cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a military officer as JFK embroiled us deeper in that conflict  --  reckless adventurism ? JFK cut income tax rates  --  fiscal irresponsibility ? Funny how time changes viewpoints . <p> LEWIS J. WALKER , Alpharetta <p> Major issues are n't being addressed <p> Both the " transcendent cause " perspective of Cynthia Tucker and the " who 's winning " perspective of Jon Margolis ( " Political playoffs , " @issue , Jan. 4 ) help deflect a focus on serious political issues . <p> " Unity " may have a nice ring , but exposure of policies and forces that have been detrimental to the public is far more important . Corporate malfeasance and criminality , manipulation of markets , simplistic free-trade policies , job losses in the millions , the ascendance of low-wage work , skewed tax cuts  --  all of these are real issues that candidates need to address . And where is the debate on the true costs to the greater society of the perpetual war on terrorism ? <p> Let us hope Margolis is wrong in contending that only college professors are concerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better manipulator and gamesman . We will all regret not taking elections quite seriously . <p> JIM GRATTAN , Grayson <p> Education : Union leaders focus on promoting greed <p> ( In response to " Governor seeks pay raise for teachers , " Page One , Jan. 4 ) : The article says , " Perdue tries to make nice with a politically active group that took some credit for his election . " A teachers union official said a 2 percent raise was " not as much as we would like . " Another article in the same issue ( " State still in deep budget hole , " Metro ) says proposals include " closing mental hospitals and kicking poor children off state-subsidized health insurance . " <p> Unlike teachers and other educationists , mental patients and poor children do n't vote . Clearly , education is a business , but it is controlled by politicians , including union politicians , with students merely a factor of production . By saying that nothing is ever " as much as we would like , " union leaders are devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and student should read Peter Brimelow 's book " The Worm in the Apple : How the Teacher Unions are Destroying American Education . " <p> MACK A. MOORE , Atlanta <p> Restore meaning to grading system <p> The missing D in the current grading system made me wonder what happened to having grades mean something tangible in relationship to performance by students ( " Changes in HOPE could bring D back , " Metro , Jan. 4 ) . <p> When I was in high school and college , an A was 93 to 100 , a B was 85-92 , a C was 76-84 and a D was 70-76 . Anything below 70 was an F for failing . In college we had a three-point scale  --  A was 3 , B was 2 , C was 1 , D was 0 and F was minus 1 . <p> Is giving students grades at lower standards helping them achieve and learn , or are we just allowing schools to give away achievement ? <p> DAVID MEYER , Atlanta <p> Do n't worsen metro burden <p> A recent editorial ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) disregards the fact that most metro county school systems are struggling financially . State and federal education legislation is costing them a fortune . Further , the influx of poor and non-English-speaking children is requiring additional costly programs . <p> The editorial refers to special local-option sales tax revenues as a windfall . We wish ! <p> Metro voters supported SPLOSTs to ensure that our schools would continue to have adequate funding in the face of construction required to support extraordinary student population growth , the high cost of state and federal mandates and the fact that the state recently increased the portion of taxes metro counties pay the state to support less affluent counties . <p> While metro counties are imposing additional taxes upon themselves to maintain educational quality , some counties keep their local school taxes artificially low and are demanding more from the state . The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 's solution would hurt the ability of metro counties to deliver a quality education and provide only a Band-Aid fix for the poorer counties . <p> Until it is determined that these counties are doing everything they possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong to further burden counties that pay dearly to provide their children a quality education and already pay a portion of the poorer counties ' tab . <p> DAN VALENTINE , Marietta <p> Mad cow disease : Responses to " Mad cow overreaction ought to make you mad , " @issue , Jan. 4 <p> Columnist 's ' facts ' are really half-truths <p> Jay Ambrose says beef is safe because , out of all the cattle slaughtered in the nation annually , inspectors have found just one with mad cow disease . But only 20,000 of 35 million cattle are tested . <p> He repeats the " fact " that mad cow prions are limited to infected brains or spinal cords . But research in the New England Journal of Medicine last year showed prions prevalent in the skeletal muscle tissue of eight of 32 muscle samples from human victims of Creutzfeld-Jakob , a mad cow-like disease . You ca n't cook prions away , sterilize them off medical or dental instruments or zap them with antibiotics . <p> The only way to defeat mad cow is with hard science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about chomping down on cow meat . <p> SHERRY BAKER , Decatur <p> Be angry about more than cows <p> Jay Ambrose 's column brings up problems beyond his editorial topic . <p> When politicians and consumer groups demand government regulations to satisfy their agendas , consumers pay the bill . <p> Recent examples , besides mad cow disease , are demands to reduce mercury discharges from coal-fired power plants by 90 percent , dispose of negligible radioactive wastes from nuclear facilities in expensive nuclear waste dumps and eliminate trace amounts of arsenic in drinking water . <p> Meeting these demands will cost consumers tens of billions of dollars without noticeable improvement of life . This should make us all angry . <p> JAMES RUST , Atlanta <p> Bar closings : Decision reflects lifestyle ignorance <p> The decision by Mayor Shirley Franklin and Atlanta City Council members to close bars at 3 a.m. was more than likely based on the lack of knowledge they all have of lifestyles different from their own . <p> I do n't think they really believed allowing people to drink and stay out late caused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quickest and easiest way of addressing a problem that needs special attention , like putting a Band-Aid on an open wound . <p> Fortunately , all of us who disagree with the decision have a voice , and we can exercise it by voting . Meanwhile , punishing the whole city and its guests is not the solution , so Atlanta officials should throw away their bandages and stitch up the wound . <p> JOE BURNS , Atlanta <p> ' International city ' more like suburbia <p> Atlanta ca n't pay for sewer repairs , help the homeless or even pave new sidewalks  --  so it reduces the tax base by closing 24-hour nightclubs that are not even in Buckhead . <p> Atlanta tries hard to be recognized as a truly international city and Midtown wants desperately to be called a 24-hour urban area . However , what we have allowed to happen makes us realize that Atlanta is a suburban town , with suburban plazas and suburbanites who move into an area and then demand it be as quiet as the cul-de-sac from which they came . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautiful noise of a city . We need to understand who we are and what we want to be before making such detrimental mistakes . <p> BRANDON MORROW , Atlanta <p> Strom Thurmond : Responses to " Thurmond 's daughter fleshed out an old story , " @issue , Jan. 4 <p> White House was n't so white <p> I am a retired registered nurse , and one of my most memorable patients was an African-American lady in Atlanta who worked as a cook in the White House in the 1930s . <p> She told how a crew was sent often to the rural South to hire cooks and housekeepers for the White House . They had to be light-skinned , pretty , young African-American women eager to get away from the farms . They were made available to congressmen , many of whom lived alone . Of course , if any of these women became pregnant , they were put on a bus and sent back home . <p> I 'll bet Strom Thurmond was n't the only congressman who fathered an interracial child . <p> CAROLYN STENGER , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the novelty and irony of an avowed segregationist and racist icon fathering a mixed-race child , we can take away only one truth from this sad footnote in American history : Politicians , and even well-meaning , decent people , will lie and conspire to protect power and false character when it 's thought to be in their interest . <p> GEORGE WATSON , Kennesaw <p> Brad Cunard : Responses to " Leaning into pain , " Living , Jan. 4 <p> He 's a powerful example of faith <p> In living through the unimaginable tragedy that struck his life , Brad Cunard gives us all a lesson in how to live and in the meaning of faith . <p> Before a tree fell on his car and took his entire family , Cunard was a person who searched for God and meaning ; now he seeks to fully experience his pain and learn what he can from it . <p> Faith is not about believing a set of doctrines ; it 's about entrusting your life to God . Cunard deserves our gratitude for showing us that faith is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> DARBY CHRISTOPHER , Dunwoody <p> Many thanks <p> Thank you for the article on Brad Cunard 's status in dealing with the tragic loss of his wife and sons  --  and for putting it in the Living section on Sunday , rather than the Faith &; Values section , where only the faithful would read it , on Saturday . <p> LeANNE DICKEY BERRY , Athens <p> SCLC headquarters belongs in Birmingham <p> To honor and ensure the perpetuity of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , its national headquarters should be moved from Atlanta to Birmingham . <p> First , Birmingham was the major battleground for the civil rights struggle during the 1960s . It was the murder of the four little girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church that pricked the conscience of the nation and , consequently , helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act . Second , relocation would mutually benefit the SCLC and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute . Historically , the black community in Birmingham has had a more passionate attachment to the SCLC than the black community in Atlanta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , " If you want a victory for the civil rights movement , come to Birmingham  --  we can win . " There is no place like home ! <p> LOVE HENRY WHELCHEL JR. , Ellenwood <p> Scouts alert for abuse <p> A letter from a former Boy Scout indicated that he and other boys slept in the same tent with their Scout leaders ( " Would he do his duty by suing Scout leader ? " Letters , Jan. 4 ) . <p> Scouting has an aggressive program of youth protection training required for renewal every other year for Boy Scout leaders . The program emphasizes that leaders must make sure that they do not participate in a one-on-one activity with a Boy Scout by themselves . <p> Child abuse is a critical problem , and Scouting is second to none in protecting boys from it . <p> JOSIAH V. BENATOR <p> Benator , of Atlanta , has been a Scout leader for more than 60 years .
