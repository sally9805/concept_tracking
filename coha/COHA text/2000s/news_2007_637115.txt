<p> They 're taking up whirlpool space in clubhouses . They 're clogging up training tables . And some of them are still throwing 95 mph . <p> They 're racking up records , taking their occasional lumps , and even stretching the standard of baseball longevity . <p> They 're the 40-something pitchers , and the fraternity is growing . <p> Atlanta 's newest pledge will be initiated Tuesday when John Smoltz turns 40 . He 'll celebrate by playing golf with old Braves battery mate Greg Olson , a guy he might not be as quick to lift in joy as he did after clinching the worst-to-first division title in 1991 . <p> Smoltz is in great shape and throwing 96 mph . His bionic elbow , seven years removed from surgical tinkering , is proving what ligament replacement surgery can do for careers that 20 years ago would have been finished . He just signed a contract extension that includes options for 2009 and 2010 . <p> " I thought I could get to 40 , but I never knew what past 40 was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the moment , it looks like roses  --  for Smoltz and a dozen others . In 1987 , there were seven 40-something pitchers in the majors , according to the Elias Sports Bureau . In 1967 , there were two . One was former Braves hurler Lew Burdette ; the other , Hoyt Wilhelm , was a knuckleballer . <p> When Roger Clemens rejoins the Yankees in a few weeks , there will be 13 pitchers in their 40s . That 's almost twice as many as 20 years ago . By comparison , the number of 40-year-old position players in 1987 was the same as it is now  --  seven . So the difference is showing up on the mound . <p> " When I broke in in 1983 , the oldest pitchers were usually around 33 to 35 , " said Cy Young Award winner Orel Hershiser , now an analyst for ESPN . " Every generation has continued to push the envelope on how long you can play . " <p> So why now ? In an era dominated by offense ? <p> Hershiser and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who just left town with the Padres , offered their two cents . They help illustrate 10 reasons so many 40-something pitchers are still in the game and successful : <p> 1 . THEY WERE PRETTY GOOD TO BEGIN WITH <p> Among the 12 , not counting Smoltz , there are 18 Cy Young awards , six League Championship or World Series MVPs and two perfect games . <p> " It 's easier for Clemens because he was better than everybody in his 20s and 30s , " Maddux said . " When he started to lose some of his physical ability , he was still better than most . That probably has a lot to do with it . If you look at most guys pitching in their 40s , they were probably pretty good in their 30s . " <p> As Clemens still wins with power pitching , so Smoltz says he believes former teammates Maddux and Tom Glavine win with their mental approach . <p> " They 've always been better than the hitter , " Smoltz said . " They 've been mentally better . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , ballparks are smaller , the mound is lower , the ball is wound tighter , the strike zone is smaller , and hitters are stronger . <p> But the pitching climate has changed , too . <p> " Five-man rotations , more bullpen use , pitching less games now , " Maddux said . " Minor league guys come up who have never had a complete game in the minor leagues . Workload is not as heavy . Pitch counts are less . Innings are down . Nobody throws 130 , 145 , 150 pitches . " <p> Hershiser says that 's necessary because pitchers face more stressful conditions . <p> " I think the wear and tear on the pitch that is thrown today is harder than the wear and tear on the pitch that was thrown 10 years ago , and then 10 years prior to that , because it takes more effort to throw the ball and then make it move , " Hershiser said . " It takes more intensity to do it to a stronger hitter in a smaller ballpark with a smaller strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40-something pitchers have good genes , and most have good habits . But Smoltz would have been long retired were it not for successful elbow reconstruction in 2000 . <p> " I 've benefited from doctors to trainers to surgery , " Smoltz said . " But I think genetics has played a big part of that , as well as to be able to recover and the perseverance to work through a lot of it . If I did n't pitch when I did n't feel good , or had aches , this career would have been cut in half . " <p> 4 . GOOD MECHANICS , ESPECIALLY IN CLEMENS ' CASE , HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID INJURY AND PRESERVE VELOCITY <p> " What serves him so well is the great mechanics that he has and the great ease in which he throws the ball  --  so efficiently , " Hershiser said . " So you can also be protecting yourself not only by the way you work out , eat , hydrate and take care of yourself with all the scientific advances , you also can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CALL IT THE DAVID WELLS FACTOR , PERHAPS <p> He weighed 260 to 270 pounds for much of his career , and until a recent diabetes diagnosis did n't bother watching his beer or fast-food intake . Yet here he is about to turn 44 next Sunday and still pitching . <p> He 's almost svelte now , and he does n't apologize for his old ways . <p> " People will say , ' Well , why did n't you take better care of yourself when you were younger . ' Well , I did n't need to . I went out every day , I did my job , I competed with guys that were 180-220 . ... <p> " I pretty much defied all the odds . Who would have thought I 'd have been here for 20 years competing at this level ? I 've ticked off a lot of people and gratefully so . I smile upon those who are jealous . " <p> 6 . BETTER DIET AND EXERCISE PLANS <p> Phillies pitcher Jamie Moyer , at 44 the oldest pitcher in baseball until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done some of his best pitching late in his career . He won 20 games for the first time at age 39 . He has pitched at least 200 innings and made 30 starts for the past six years . <p> He keeps fit with weight training and , most recently , spinning , or indoor cycling . He and his wife own a spinning studio in Seattle . Physical preparation helps him cope with the unexpected . <p> " Some days I feel like I 'm 50 , " Moyer said . " Some days I feel like I 'm 25 . As you get older , you take a step back and say , ' Let me listen to my body , be realistic about it and react from there . ' " <p> Even Maddux , known to be doughy around the middle , uses a trainer in the offseason . This spring he started doing yoga with his Padres teammates . <p> " You 've got to make sure you 've got a little bit of something under the fat , " said Maddux , smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even Clemens , who still throws in the low 90s , has changed his approach . <p> " It 's really the difference between going from a high fastball/breaking ball pitcher to a low fastball/split-finger pitcher , " Hershiser said . " The high fastball/breaking ball  --  those can get hit for home runs and extra-base hits when you 're off . The low fastball/low split-finger pitches , when you make mistakes , there are more ground balls . And he 's getting just as many swings and misses ... with the split-finger as he was with the high fastball . " <p> 8 . THE CUT FASTBALL <p> The easiest way to prolong a career once was to be left-handed . But right-handers are adding cut fastballs and split-fingers to help them handle left-handed hitters . <p> " Once you lose your velocity , the outer half of the plate is where you want to live , " Hershiser said . " But when you come inside , you do n't have the velocity to actually get in on them , so you need velocity plus movement . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> 9 . MONEY AI N'T BAD <p> Those 12 40-somethings will make about $85.7 million this year . It 'd be naive to think money is n't a driving force . <p> " Part of it has to do with how much money is being made , so it is worth the extra effort , " Hershiser said . <p> Said Smoltz , who will make $14 million next season : " I think the general public would obviously say , ' Gosh , the money is making them play . ' It 's not totally out of the picture , but I think from a standpoint of heart . The day I start looking at , ' Oh , well , ' is the day I 'm gone . " <p> 10 . THE LOVE OF THE GAME <p> Each of the 40-something pitchers has it . <p> " You 've got to have the heart and will to do it , " Wells said . <p> At the end of last season , Wells thought he was going to retire . It 's a common question for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dugout in St. Louis and started crying , " Wells said . <p> But a hunting trip to Africa and a little peace of mind later , " Boomer " was back with the Padres . <p> " Orioles executive and former pitcher Mike Flanagan said it best : Once you lose the butterflies , get out of the game because it 's not going to work , " Wells said . " I get butterflies . I still get nervous . Maybe I 've got an angel on my shoulder giving those to me . " Photo : Associated PressJohn Smoltz/ImageData* ImageData* Photo : David Wells/ImageData*
