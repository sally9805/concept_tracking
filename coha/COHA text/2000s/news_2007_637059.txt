<p> Dalton  --  A Cobb County police officer testified Monday that his co-worker and best friend Glenn Turner made ominous comments about his wife only a couple of weeks before he died of antifreeze poisoning . <p> " He told me if anything happened to him that I needed to look at Lynn , " Cpl . David Dunkerton testified in the opening day of Lynn Turner 's capital murder trial . <p> Turner , a 38-year-old former Cobb County 911 operator , is charged with killing Randy Thompson , a Forsyth County firefighter and the father of her two children , with a lethal dose of antifreeze in 2001 . <p> But prosecutors are hoping to bolster their circumstantial case against Turner by showing jurors that Glenn Turner died the same way as Thompson six years earlier . <p> Lynn Turner has been convicted in her husband 's death and sentenced to life in prison with possibility of parole . If she 's convicted in Thompson 's death , she could be given the death penalty . <p> Dunkerton and others in Cobb 's close-knit law enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the declining state of his year-and-a-half marriage and his plans to move out , just before he died . <p> They described Glenn Turner as a happy-go-lucky guy who wanted his marriage to work , but was tired of working seven days a week to support her spending habits . <p> Several members of the victims ' families attended the trial 's opening day . Some wiped tears from their eyes as Dunkerton , himself choked with emotion , described riding his motorcycle at the front of Glenn Turner 's funeral procession and putting Turner 's motorcycle helmet in his casket . <p> In opening statements , prosecutors portrayed Lynn Turner as a debt-strapped free-spender who manipulated two men and killed them for money . <p> " She had a taste for caviar and resources for peanuts , " special prosecutor Jack Mallard told the seven-man , five-woman jury . " This case is about lust , greed and murder  --  one woman and two men . " Defense attorney Vic Reynolds insisted the prosecution 's case is built on " gossip , " " rumor " and " innuendo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't able to show " where the poisoning happened , when it happened , how it happened , " Reynolds said . <p> Prosecutors and Turner 's defense team expect to call about 75 witnesses over the next two to three weeks . The trial was initially expected to take place in Forsyth County , where Thompson lived and Turner grew up and had worked at the sheriff 's office , district attorney 's office and for a State Court judge . <p> But Forsyth Chief Superior Court Judge Jeffrey S. Bagley said pretrial publicity prevented Turner from getting a fair trial in Cumming and ordered the case moved outside the Atlanta media market to Whitfield Superior Court . <p> Turner 's first trial drew national television coverage . Several media outlets covered the opening day , their cameras hidden from the jury 's view by a blackboard . <p> Mallard said Lynn Turner lavished both her husband and Thompson with expensive gifts and then persuaded them to make her the beneficiaries of their life insurance policies and employee savings accounts . <p> The evidence , he said , will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic involvement with Lynn Turner " the common denominator . " Mallard said the evidence will show that Lynn Turner pursued Glenn Turner and showered him with expensive gifts until he agreed to move in with her . Once they were engaged , he made her the beneficiary of his work savings account . Once married , she pressured him into making her the beneficiary of a $100,000 insurance policy he had , Mallard told the jurors . <p> The marriage quickly fell apart , and unbeknownst to Glenn Turner , Lynn Turner started dating Thompson , taking him on trips and buying him presents . A day after Glenn Turner 's death , she was on the phone , trying to collect on his insurance . Four days later , she was moving into an apartment in Cumming and listing Thompson as living there , Mallard said . <p> He said Lynn Turner collected the $100,000 insurance , $752 a month on Glenn Turner 's retirement and $47,587.50 more in insurance money . <p> Later that year , Thompson and Lynn Turner were expecting a child , and Thompson started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his mother to Lynn Turner . <p> By 2001 , Lynn Turner was deep in credit card and mortgage debt but promising at least one creditor that she would " take care of her debt soon . " <p> " She was so desperate for money , she went back to the barrel one more time , " Mallard said . " After all , she got away with it for six years . " Lynn Turner was eligible to receive $1,400 a month from Social Security for her two children with Thompson and also collected $36,000 on one insur- <p> nce policy he had . <p> Reynolds said Lynn Turner was n't aware of that policy and knew in advance of Thompson 's death that he had allowed a $100,000 policy to lapse . <p> " In the end , when it is all said and done , the motives will be gone , " Reynolds said . " The reasons will be gone . " <p> Witnesses , including Thompson 's stepsister , Angie Bollinger , testified that Lynn Turner showered Thompson with expensive boots , clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner whipped out a stack of credit cards and bought Thompson a pair of boots . She said Turner fanned the credit cards out " like a deck of cards . " <p> " I was just kind of in amazement , " Bollinger said . <p> She disputed defense suggestions that Thompson had major financial problems and might have killed himself . " He would never do that . " <p> Bollinger testified that Lynn Turner told her Glenn Turner had died in the line of duty . Photo : Lynn Turner is accused of killing Randy Thompson in 2001 by poisoning him with antifreeze.
