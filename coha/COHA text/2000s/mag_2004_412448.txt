Saddened but still fighting , newly convicted Martha Stewart hunkers down with loved ones-and faces the harsh prospect of prison // Moments after listening to federal Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum read the verdict on March 5 , Martha Stewart placed the most difficult phone call of her life . In a private room in the New York City courthouse , she dialed her 89-year-old mother , Martha Kostyra , and gently warned , " It 's bad news . " Then , Stewart told her that she had been found guilty on all four felony charges against her . As Stewart alternately consoled her mom and her daughter , Alexis , who stood sobbing by her side , her defense team stood nearby in a state of stunned disbelief . Lead attorney Robert MorvilIo could muster only one sentence : " We failed you , and Fm sorry . " Stewart , says a defense source , " was the most together of everyone in the room , " assuring her team that they had done everything they could . Still , she admitted to them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now the woman who relentlessly built a $1 billion personal empire by instructing others how to beautify their lives must sit and wait while others decide just how difficult her life is going to get . In coming weeks , a federal probation officer will inspect her estate in Westport , Conn. , and pore over her tax returns and financial records to help determine the fine Stewart will pay for lying about her sale of Imclone Systems stock . Then , at a june 17 sentencing hearing , Stewart will learn if-and for how long-she is going to prison . " I have so much to do ; there are so many things to take care of , " she told her friend Susan Warburg on March 9 . Charles Simonyi , another friend , says , " She has to get her finances into order . She has a lot to do with the company , with getting information , with the appeal process . " In the first hours after the verdict , Stewarf s main concern was for her only child , Alexis , 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart , 62 , told Simonyi . Warburg says , " Like any mother and daughter , they probably have their stormy moments , but Martha has always considered Alexis to be her closest confidante . " In the wake of Martha 's divorce from Andy Stewart in 1990 , Alexis sided with her mother . During the recent trial , Alexis sat in the front row of the courtroom each day . Over the weekend , Stewart retreated to her white colonial home in Westport , where she was joined by Alexis , her mother and two of her five siblings , George Christiansen , 51 , and Laura Plimpton , 49 . " I think she is really struggling to maintain strength and carry on , " says Plimpton , who is disheartened by " the glee that so many people seem to be having watching this happen . " On Saturday Stewart told Warburg by phone , " Fm very sad . " Yet Sunday morning , Stewart greeted Warburg with a home-whipped latte before the two did their regular workout of stretching and treadmill exercise . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Warburg , a friend of 31 years . Even under siege , Martha was hearteningly Martha . " She asked me about my garden , " Warburg says . " She thought I should have a trellis with euonymus , an evergreen bush . " Come Monday , Stewart turned her attention to the company she built from scratch , Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia-a company that lost 22 percent of its value the day of the verdict . According to sources , she and board members are leaning toward her relinquishing her board seat but continuing to play some creative role . While most distributors of her products tookawaitand-see attitude , Viacom yanked Martha Stewart Living from the CBS and UPN stations it owns and operates . ( Syndicator KingWorld will continue to make it available to local stations . ) Meanwhile , the public rendered its own split verdict . An unscientific poll conducted by PEOPLE.com found respondents almost evenly divided about whether or not Stewart should go to prison . So were shoppers at a K-Mart in Hyannis , Mass . " It 's a damn shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who continues to stock Stewart 's housewares . " I hope they do n't put her in jail . " Grace Smith , 23 , who vows not to buy Martha Stewart Everyday products , counters , " She should n't get off just because of who she is . " Actually , in the long run , the " who she is " aspect of the trial may have hurt Stewart 's image the most . Testimony depicted her mocking the diction of her broker 's assistant , whom she called an " idiot , " and threatening to leave the brokerage house if the phone-hold music was n't changed . Her lavish habits were also documented . After running up a $17,000 tab with a friend during a vacation in Mexico and Panama , Stewart tried unsuccessfully to bill her company for her suite , spa treatments and a private kayak tour . Such diva behavior wo n't cut it in prison-which is where Stewart is widely expected to land . Given federal sentencing guidelines , the bet is that judge Cedarbaumwill impose a sentence of 10 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum-security prison in Danbury , Conn . Defense attorney Morvillo will no doubt ask Cedarbaum to stay the sentence , pending appeals . If Stewart does land in a minimumsecurity facility , there wo n't be bars on the windows or doors-but it wo n't be some cushy Club Fed . Some 70 percent of her fellow inmates will be drug offenders , and the atmosphere will resemble boot camp . " Prison is the great equalizer , " says David Novak , a former Microsoft consultant who spent almost a year in a federal facility for insurance fraud and now advises inmates on surviving in prison . Karen Bond , who spent three years in a minimum-security facility for securities fraud ( see box ) , describes what Stewart can anticipate . On day one , following a strip search , Stewart will be issued a used khaki-colored cotton uniform of elastic-waist pants and a button-down shirt , sneaker-like shoes for downtime and black , steel-toed boots for work . Her assignment , which could be anything from cleaning bathrooms to cooking meals or mowing lawns , will occupy 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 cents an hour . She will shower in a communal bathroom . " She wo n't be isolated from the scum of the earth , " says Bond . Come mealtime , Stewart will face a diet relentlessly high in fat and carbs . ( She will also be allowed to spend $290 a month at the commissary , where she can buy tuna fish and snacks . ) At night she can expect to sleep either in a dorm-style room with up to 12 women or in a larger space subdivided into cubicles . In the latter event , she will have a cube-mate , with whom she will share a folding chair and writing table ; as a newcomer , she is likely to get the less desirable upper bunk . The noise , all day and all night , will take some getting used to . When Stewart is not lining up for one of the several daily inmate counts , she will probably have access during leisure time to a few pieces of exercise equipment . Some prisons offer hiking or yoga . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be creative . " But not too creative . Any calls Stewart makes during the 300 minutes of phone time she is allotted monthly will be tape-recorded and probably screened , to make sure she in no way participates in the running of her business . Novak encourages Stewart to tutor fellow inmates . " If you go in with the right attitude , " he says , " there 's an opportunity to do a lot of healing and to reestablish your value system . " One critical bit of advice Novak gives his clients facing prison . " You need to let go , " he says . " Give up the fight , accept responsibility for the decisions that put you here . " For Stewart , who 's built her life and fortune around self-improvement projects , that may be the most ambitious project of all . Sidebar Stewart ( on March 3 ) " is obviously distressed , but she is taking it calmly and stoically , " says her friend Charles Simonyi . " She is very focused on the next 100 steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others did brisk business selling tokens of support that protested Stewart 's conviction-and her possible prison term .
