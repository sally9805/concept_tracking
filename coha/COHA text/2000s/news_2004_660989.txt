<p> Will the universe eventually collapse in the " big crunch , " expand forever in the " big loneliness , " or be torn to bits in the " big rip " ? <p> The key to answering those questions appears to lie in a mysterious form of energy that has been cracking the cosmic whip on the universe for the past 6 billion to 7 billion years . This " dark energy " appears to be causing the universe to grow at an accelerated rate rather than a rate scientists previously thought would slow forever . <p> Six years after astronomers first stunned the scientific world with this discovery , researchers say dark energy still baffles them . Yet several studies reported over the past year have strengthened the evidence for dark energy 's role as cosmic gas pedal , researchers say . <p> The results " point to the promise of improving our understanding of dark energy , " says Michael Turner , head of the astronomy and astrophysics department at the University of Chicago . That understanding , he says , is critical to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe and the nature of matter and space-time . <p> Last week , researchers from Britain , Germany , and the United States announced results from studies of hot gas surrounding vast clusters of galaxies . The effort , using NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory , was designed to determine the amount of dark energy the universe holds , compared with other forms of matter and energy . In addition , the team took a tentative stab at trying to see if the amount of dark energy changes with time - key to determining its nature . <p> Anyone reading their results might be excused for feeling a bit special . The team found that 4 percent of the universe is made of ordinary matter . Another 21 percent consists of so-called dark matter , inferred from its gravitational effects on matter . The remaining 75 percent consists of dark energy , which exerts a form of pressure that makes it act like gravity thrown into reverse . These figures are consistent with results reported last year from satellite measurements of the big bang 's afterglow - the cosmic microwave background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , astronomers say , the universe will continue to expand at an increasing rate . In about 20 billion years or so , only about 100 galaxies might be visible from Earth . Think of it as the " big lonely . " If dark energy were to change with time , it could relax to let gravity once again dominate , prompting the universe to collapse in the " big crunch . " Or if the pace speeds up , it could lead to the " big rip , " in which the fabric of space-time stretches so rapidly that even atoms get torn apart . <p> Based on the team 's observations , dark energy is holding steady and " behaves much like the cosmological constant in Einstein 's theories " about the evolution of the universe , says Steve Allen , an astronomer at Cambridge University in England and the team leader . <p> Essentially , this means that the amount of energy per volume of space remains constant . If this observation holds up under more rigorous programs , it would substantially narrow the range of explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bad for a " constant " that Albert Einstein dubbed his greatest blunder . In 1917 , when he pondered the implications of his general relativity theory for the universe , most astronomers believed that the size of the universe did n't change . Other galaxies appeared on astronomers ' photographic plates , but many thought the fuzzy images were nebulae or clusters of stars in the Milky Way . <p> When Einstein applied his equations to the observed universe , his numbers led him to an unsettling conclusion . Given the way his equations showed gravity distorting the shape of space-time , and given the amount of matter and energy in the universe to exert gravity , the universe could not remain static . It would have to collapse through gravitational attraction . <p> Observers saw no evidence for change , so he reasoned that there must be some form of " negative energy " offsetting gravity 's tug . By tweaking his numbers , he could get a static universe . <p> In the 1920s , Edwin Hubble burst Einstein 's bubble . Using the most powerful telescopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were galaxies , and that the galaxies appeared to be speeding away . The universe was expanding . <p> For nearly 60 more years , astronomers would trot out Einstein 's blunder to explain one new phenomenon or another , only to find later that more conventional explanations were correct . <p> Meanwhile , particle physicists in the 1960s were working on ideas in quantum mechanics in which a vacuum could exhibit a form of energy . And when they applied Einstein 's theory of general relativity to this vacuum energy , thought to permeate the cosmos , it produced the gravitational repulsion that mimicked Einstein 's cosmological constant . The work gave the feature an underpinning in physics it had lacked . <p> The only task left was to observe it in nature . That came in 1998 , when two teams working independently reported observations that showed space expanding at a more rapid rate than it should be . <p> This time , invoking a gravitationally repulsive dark energy appears to be the correct answer . But how it relates to physicists ' discoveries about the forces of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dark energy could indeed be Einstein 's cosmological constant . It could be a quantum field dubbed " quintessence . " Or it could be a new aspect of gravity itself . <p> " Keep in mind that we call this dark energy , but that gives a false impression that we understand what it is . We really do n't , " says Adam Riess , astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Md . Early this year , Dr. Riess and colleagues added what many astronomers call a significant advance in observing dark energy . <p> In February , the team published results of Hubble Space Telescope observations that spanned a range of distances and periods in the universe 's history . They found the period , some 6 billion years ago , when the shift occurred from a slowdown in the rate of expansion to an acceleration - a turning point that has become known as the " big jerk . " The team used the light from a powerful " standard candle " - a type of exploding star , or supernova - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these objects to determine the speed at which the galaxies containing the supernovae were receding . <p> A third major contribution came last year from a set of studies involving the cosmic microwave background measurements from a NASA satellite and observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey . Both pointed to dark energy as the dominant ingredient in the universe 's recipe . And by combining data from the two , four teams working independently found evidence for the action of dark energy on the scale of galaxy clusters , which cover a huge expanse of space and embrace from 50 to 1,000 galaxies . <p> Taken together , the X-ray , supernova , and microwave-survey studies represent " extraordinary evidence " for dark energy , the University of Chicago 's Turner said at a briefing last week . <p> The next step is to learn whether dark energy varies with time . Already , Riess and his colleagues have been awarded a generous amount of observing time with the Hubble Space Telescope next year to get a more detailed look at dark energy 's workings . Ground- and space-based optical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telescopes are getting into the act . And Chandra will be surveying more clusters at a wider range of distances . <p> The discovery of dark energy has handed researchers " the most profound problem in all of science , " Turner says . Solving it " will require a full-court press . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
