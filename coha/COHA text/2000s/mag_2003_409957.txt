He visited Keramos just three times between 1931 and 1952 and found its terrain annoyinglysoft . Its malleability invited too many personas , he thought . The final baked good could look like anything , he once said . And anything , presumably , could slide into nothing . That was n't the case with more resilient studio stuff , such as wood and stone . Those materials held their shapes and identities , coming solid from nature with a rich variation of tones and grains , or veined with crystallized color . clay was too facile , too fluid , he said , " more like painting . " Yet , as the exhibition " lsamu Noguchi and Modern Japanese Ceramics " reveals , that disinclination did n't keep him from producing a body of distinctive works. * Curated by Louise Allison Cort and organized by the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution , it presents 37 of his clay works and about the same number of ceramics by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noguchi during his sessions with clay . The artist , in a search of cultural and personal identity , made ceramics only in Japan . he spent five months with clay in Kyoto in 1931 , an intensive week in Seto in 1950 , then several months more in Kita Kamakura and Bizen in 1952 . As the title suggests , this show is an exercise in cultural comparisons . It juxtaposes a relatively overlooked aspect of Noguchi's6o-year career with works by a handful of distinguished 20th-century Japanese potters . Some were pot turners-Kitaoji Rosanjin being just one-who hosted Noguchi 's efforts at their own studios . Others were admirers drawn to Noguchi 's inspired independence and the ease with which he moved in and out of the traditions of Japanese mud . Like Miro , Picasso and other high-end visitors to ceramics in the past century , Noguchi was a fresh outsider who plunged right in without a care about cultural conventions or expectations . His stubborn focus was the advancement of his own ideas . By his first immersion in clay , Noguchi 's sculptural thinking had evolved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slimmed-down modernism picked up during a brief stint as Brancusi 's studio assistant , in 1927 , into an outlook favoring organic simplicity . Not " organic " in the sense of shapes belonging to certain living things-though he surely knew how to abstract from nature - but as in forms that sprung to visual life . Noguchi made more than 300 ceramics in all-from pots and plates to freestanding sculptures and forms lashed with rope to poles . he made them just about every way known to potters. he molded forms from slurry and built them by hand with slabs and coils , and he altered the roundness of the vessels thrown for him . Regardless of the genre or method , he fused the old in Japanese clay with whatever was new in his searching mind . The results were hybrids that , as Cort and other contributors to the exhibition 's fine catalog point out , defied Japanese expectations about how ceramics should act and appear . Clay was more than merely a sculptural medium for Noguchi . It was a conduit between the divergent cultures of his birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yone Noguchi , his mother the American writer Leonie Gilmour . They parted before Noguchi was born , in 1904 , in California . The artist was brought to Japan by his mother when he was two and raised there , but then he returned to the United States alone to attend school when he was 13. he grew up estranged from his father , but not from Japanese culture or the desire to be , as his father was , " an interpreter of the East to the West . " Those were the words Noguchi used in a 1927 application for the Guggenheim Foundation grant that enabled him to travel and work abroad for several years . he spent some ofthat time soaking up Europe and working in Brancusi 's studio . he devoted the rest to travel in China and Japan , where , in 1931 , he set to work in the studio of the Kyoto potter Uno Ninmatsu I. At first he cast terra-cotta portraits that revealed more about his academic figurative roots than they did about his interest in sculptural modernism . Yet during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Queen-a compelling figurelike fusion of ancient and modern-haniwa and Brancusi , with a schoolmarmish stance thrown in forstern effect .

This became Noguchi 's way of revealing the material truth of his forms and giving them their own earthen reality . It was the reverse of the dazzling polish with which he finished his sculptures in wood , stone and steel . he left a visual hiss of surface marks on just about all of his hand-built pieces . he left the seams of The Queen and other molded forms as they were , making no effort to erase or treat them as unwanted remnantsof process . It was at once an ancient and modern approach and aesthetic , a 20th-century echo of the truth-to-materials song that Japanese potters had sung for centuries , from haniwa to Bizen , lga , Tamba , Shigaraki and more . Little wonder Noguchi felt , as he put it , that the very earth and sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same could n't be said of America and other industrialized quarters , where mechanization and the voracious sensibilities of modernism were clearing the cultural decks of everything old and outmoded , including clay . In the realm of modern sculpture , clay had become an undesirable medium of discredited academic practices . It represented a lowly step in the process of producing bronzes . An intriguing aspect of Noguchi 's involvement with the medium is the way in which he adapted his sculptural vision to what clay allowed him to do . His outlook evolved from one that at first saw clay as a form to be shaped from the outside , much like the stone and wood he was accustomed to carving . As a result , most of his early efforts-The Queen being just one-were closed or self-contained . Over the years he gradually opened his forms , letting his eye and mind inhabit and move through them from inside to outside . MyMu , The Policeman , Tiger and other open slab sculptures from the early 19505 show Noguchi mentally stepping inside his small clay spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay as it did about his involvement with furniture design and other media , which spurred him to think in new ways about inhabiting form . The sculptural freedom Noguchi showed in diving into forms and opening them up was hardly a hit in Japan . Critics generally gave thumbs-down to his exhibition there in 1952 . But Noguchi 's ceramics became a beacon for several young artists seeking to escape the utilitarian emphasis of Japanese ceramics . Yagi Kazuo , Yamada Hikaru and Suzuki Osamu formed an avantgarde group called Sodeisha ( crawling through mud association ) . One ca n't help looking at their works in this show and sensing an Eastern echo of the Otis revolution in clay taking place in California in the 19505 . The two occurred independently , yet both arose on the heels of a warthat had , for some artists at least , filled an era with questions and doubts about the relevance of tradition . What 's clear is that the Japanese version seemed to stay much closer to the conventions the artists sought to escape . The irony , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , improvising on works by some of Japan 's more conservative interpreters of the medium - Hamada and Rosanjin . None of this affected Noguchi. he sailed along on his own vessel , using the very materials of the great Japanese ceramic traditions to make objects that followed none of the conventions . The earth of Japan had , as he wrote , opened his eyes " as if in discovery of some new horizon . " Photograph LEFT TO RIGHT : YAGI KAZUO- Work No. 51- .
