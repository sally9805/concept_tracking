Chapter One OPENING DAY . Said separately , they 're just two ordinary words . " Opening " and " day . " No big deal . But put them together , liberally sprinkle some thirty-year-old memories , and they take on a meaning that can simultaneously bring a rush of excitement and a threat of tears . At least to me . " Opening day . " My mind 's eye conjures up men in pin-stripes racing onto a lush green field as the public address announcer booms , " Ladies and gentlemen , the New York Yankees ! " That field is a clean spring slate ; none of those players have yet made an error , or hit into a double play , or thrown a bat in disgust . Nor have they plans to . The feeling I have on opening day is one I shared with my father and one he shared with his father before that . Today it takes on an added significance , because I 'm going to continue that legacy . The experience wo n't be quite identical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptable . I should mention the differences , subtle though they are . First of all , since I do n't have any children , the offspring I am passing the sacred tradition on to is my golden retriever , Tara . Also , with the baseball season a good month away , we wo n't be going to Yankee Stadium , and we wo n't be seeing a base-ball game . The particular opening that we are attending is that of Paterson , New Jersey 's first-ever dog park . I 've never actually been to a dog park ; I 'm not even sure what one is . Tara has n't been to one either , unless it was during the first two years of her life , before I knew her . If she has , I suspect the experience was less than thrilling , since I told her yesterday that we 'd be going , and she was not awake all night in eager anticipation . This dog park is supposed to be a pretty big deal . It was even a campaign issue in the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I guess Paterson must have a lot of people like me , concerned citizens who vote the straight dog ticket . As Tara and I drive over , I 'm not getting the feeling that she 's into the swing of things . She sits on the front seat , munches on a rawhide chewy , and does n't show the least bit of interest in where we might be headed . Even when we get close , and we can hear the barking , she does n't bother to look up and just keeps chomping away . Now I know why my father never gave me chewies on the way to Yankee games . The park itself is nothing more than a very large dirt area , maybe the size of a football field , fenced on all sides . There must be a hundred dogs running around , getting to know each other , stopping to drink at numerous and well-positioned water fountains . Sort of a canine singles bar . There are maybe half as many humans , almost exclusively women , standing off to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sends the dogs into an absolute frenzy . As we near the entrance gate , Tara seems to watch this scene with some measure of horror , much as I would approach a mosh pit . But she 's a good sport ; she checks her dignity at the door and enters with me . I walk toward the humans , and so does Tara . She 'll do this for my sake , but she 's not about to go fighting for a tennis ball like some animal . The conversation , as might be expected , pretty much centers around all things canine . The dog park , the dogs , dog food , dog toys ... it all seems fascinating , except as a male I 'm not included . Tara keeps leaning against my leg , in a subtle suggestion that we bail out of here . I am preparing to do just that when a woman deigns to speak to me . " Your dog seems a little antisocial . " She 's talking about Tara , and if she had n't said it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out right now . I decide to go with glib . " This is n't really her scene . She 's an intellectual . Bring her to a poetry reading , and she 's the life of the party . " The woman , nice-looking despite her " yuppie puppie " headband , for some reason decides this could be a conversation worth continuing . " I have a friend looking for a golden retriever puppy . What breeder did you get her from ? " I shake my head . " I did n't . She was in the animal shelter . " She is amazed by this , as I was , as would be any normal human being . " You mean somebody abandoned this dog ? And she could have been ... " She does n't want to say " killed " or " put to sleep , " so I take her off the hook with a nod . " She was on her last day when I got her . " The horrified woman calls some of her friends over to tell them this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court in the middle of maybe twenty women , all of them gushing over my sensitivity for having rescued this dog . The dog in question , Tara , stands dutifully by my side , enduring the embarrassment and apparently willing to let me take the credit , even though she was the one stuck in that shelter . After a few minutes of embellishing the story about the animal shelter , which I am now referring to as " death row , " I move smoothly into light banter . This is interrupted by a woman standing toward the back . " Hey , are n't you that lawyer who won that big case ? I saw you on television . Andy Carpenter , right ? " I nod as modestly as I can manage . She is talking about the Willie Miller case , in which I proved Willie 's innocence in a retrial after he had spent seven years facing the death penalty . The women connect the dots and realize that I am that rare person who saves both dogs and people from death rows everywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's daunting , but that 's the price I pay for being heroic . Suddenly , there is a sign of life and interest from Tara , as she moves quickly toward a woman approaching our group . The newcomer , to my surprise , is Laurie Collins , the chief ( and only ) investigator for my law practice , and the chief ( and only ) woman that I am in love with . She would not have been my first choice to interrupt this meeting of my all-female sensitivity class , but she looks so good that I do n't really mind . As Laurie comes closer , I can see that she does n't only look good , she looks intense . She does n't even lean over to pet Tara , an uncharacteristic oversight which surprises me and positively shocks Tara . Laurie comes right over to me , and my devoted fans part slightly and grudgingly to let her through . " Alex Dorsey is dead , " she says . " What ? " It 's a reflex question . I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's exactly what I get . " Somebody decapitated him , then poured gasoline on his body and set it on fire . " If you ever want to get rid of twenty adoring women , I know a line you can use . My fans leave so fast you 'd think there was a " 70% off " sale at Petco . Based on the gleam in Laurie 's eye , that 's exactly what she expected . Within moments it is just Laurie , Tara , and myself . " Sorry to interrupt , Andy , " she says . " At first I was n't sure it was you . I thought it might be a rock star . " I put on my most wistful look . " For a moment there , I was . " " You up for breakfast at Charlie 's ? Because I 'd like to talk to you about Dorsey . " " Okay , " I say . " I 'll meet you there . " She nods and walks to her car . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , which is just five minutes from my house . On the way there , I reflect on Dorsey 's death and what it might mean to me . The answer is that it means absolutely nothing at all to me , except for the impact it will have on Laurie . But that will be considerable . Alex Dorsey was a lieutenant in the Paterson Police Department when Laurie was making detective , and she was assigned to his command at the time of her promotion . It did n't take long for her to realize that whatever he once had been , he had ceased to be a very good cop . If there was an easy way out , Dorsey would find an even easier one . He was a walking billboard for the twenty-year retirement rule , although obviously he had chosen to take his retirement while still on the job . It took a while longer for Laurie to realize that laziness was not Alex Dorsey 's biggest vice . Like most of her colleagues , she had heard the rumors that Dorsey was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth was something even worse . Dorsey was playing both sides ; he was partners in business with the criminals he was supposed to be investigating . And he was such a tough , resourceful son of a bitch that he had been getting away with it for a long time . Laurie agonized about what to do but emotionally did n't really have a choice . Her father and uncle had been cops , good cops , and she learned from a very early age that what Dorsey was doing was the worst kind of public betrayal . Laurie developed some evidence against him , circumstantial but a compelling start , and presented it to Internal Affairs . It was not her job to prove the case , and besides , she knew that they could take it from there . Conclusive evidence would not be difficult to uncover , and it would n't be long before Dorsey paid for his sins . But the first sign that Dorsey was not going down easily was the almost immediate public knowledge that Laurie was the person who had turned him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which guarantees anonymity to those who turn over evidence implicating an officer in a crime . Laurie 's action was also considered by some a violation by her of the ridiculous code of silence , which says that cops do n't turn on other cops , no matter how slimy those other cops might be . The controversy brought chaos and bitterness to the department . Dorsey had developed quite a power base over the years , and he was aware of skeletons in closets where most people did n't even know there were closets . The rank and file , and probably the department leadership , were drawn to one side or the other , and it became perceived as Alex Dorsey versus Laurie Collins . His supporters viewed her as the enemy , or worse , as a traitor . It became apparent to Laurie that the investigation , mired in departmental and even mayoral politics , was going to be neither complete nor fruitful . So when the word finally came out that Dorsey was merely reprimanded for " improprieties , " rather than dismissed and charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she left the department . She opened her own investigative agency , and I became one of her clients . Happily , I became much more later on . A week ago , word got out that new information had surfaced and that Dorsey was facing imminent arrest . Unfortunately , that word must have also gotten to Dorsey , who proceeded to disappear . Laurie openly admitted to feeling vindicated by the turn of events , which was the last we had heard of Dorsey until today 's grisly discovery . I drop Tara off , give her a biscuit , and head over to Charlie 's . It is basically a sports bar/restaurant , but it has recently added a terrific breakfast menu . One of the many things I love about Laurie is that she likes Charlie 's as much as I do , which is about as much as is possible to like a restaurant . Even on Sunday mornings , when there are no games on the ten television screens , it 's a great place to be . I order some fresh fruit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepare to listen . I know Laurie well enough to realize that in this case , when she says she needs to talk to me , that is n't exactly what she means . What she needs to do right now is talk period , and she feels a little silly if there 's nobody around to hear it . So I am the designated listener . Laurie starts a five-minute soliloquy about Dorsey , rehashing some of their history together . It 's nothing I do n't already know , and nothing she does n't know I already know . She wraps it up with , " He was a bad guy . A really bad guy . You know that . " Recognizing that it is my turn to speak , I nod . " Yes , I do . He was a bad guy . Absolutely . A bad guy . " Laurie is silent for a few moments , then says softly , " The thing that bothers me , Andy , is that I 'm glad he 's dead . When I heard about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission from someone who , when she catches a fly , takes it outside and turns it loose . " That 's normal , " I say . She shakes her head , unwilling to be let off the hook . " Not for me . " " He was a dirty cop who had it coming . " I twirl my imaginary mustache and inject some humor . " Said the liberal to the conservative . " She seems completely unamused , which I have to assume reflects her emotional state rather than the quality of the joke . I try again , continuing with the same theme . " At today 's performance , the role of tough law-and-order advocate will be played by Andy Carpenter , and the role of defender of the indefensible will be played by Laurie Collins . " She ignores this one as well ; I should be writing them down to use on more appreciative audiences . The fact is , I ca n't get that exercised about Dorsey 's death ; the planet is a healthier place for his being gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an emotional toothache , and I 'm hoping she can now put it behind her . But she 's not letting it drop , so I decide to steer the conversation toward the nuts and bolts of today 's news . " Do they have any suspects ? " I ask . " Does n't seem like it . Pete 's theory is that his mob friends turned on him once he was no longer of any value to them . " " Pete " is Lieutenant Pete Stanton , my closest , and only , friend on the police force , and one of the few officers who openly supported Laurie during the tough times . I 'm not surprised that he would be the one to provide her with information about Dorsey 's death . " Where was he found ? " I ask . " In a warehouse on McLean Boulevard . Kids called in an alarm when they saw smoke . Turned out it was Dorsey that was on fire . " She takes a deep breath and continues . " They think his head was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must have kept it as a souvenir . And the body was burned beyond recognition . They only ID 'd him based on some unusual kind of ring he was wearing . " My antennae go up . " That 's all ? " She nods . " But they 're running a DNA test to be sure . " I 'm glad to hear that . I would n't put it past Dorsey to murder someone else and fake the whole thing . People on both sides of the law have a tendency to stop chasing you when they think you 're dead . We talk about the Dorsey situation some more , until there 's nothing left to say about it . " Are you going into the office tomorrow ? " she asks . I nod . " Probably late morning . I 'm meeting with Holbrook on the Danny Rollins case at nine-thirty . " " Wow . Practice is really taking off , huh ? " Laurie is gently mocking both the fact that I 'm representing Danny Rollins , who happens to be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else to do . I have n't taken on a significant client in the six months since the Willie Miller case . And it 's not that I have n't had the opportunities . The way the trial ended , with Willie getting off and the real killers exposed , I became a media darling and Paterson 's answer to Perry Mason . I 've been at the top of every felon 's wish list ever since . But I 've rejected them all . Each turndown had its own rationale . Continues ...
