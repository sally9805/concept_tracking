Her eyes light up when she hears them talk about war and battle . " <p> * Did she ever have tomboy tendencies ? " I used to go out fighting a bit when I was a girl , against other girls . But I 'm a bit of a girly girl as well . So is Eowyn . It was important that she had grace and elegance . " <p> * Had she read the books before ? " I was put off from it when I was growing up because it seemed like a boy 's book . " <p> * Her wardrobe . " I 've always loved that medieval shape . My favorite is the white one , because it is very clean and pure and represents her being the white lady of Rohan . " <p> * Sneak peek .

But he is a leader and ultimately takes matters into his own hands . " <p> * On his riding skills . " Eomer spends 99% of his life on horseback patrolling the borders of Rohan . If the horse feels you are confident , life is a lot easier . " <p> * What about his weapons training ? " My first day on set , this old fellow comes over to me and shows me a few parries . One of his assistants comes up and says , ' Do n't you know who that was ? That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I said , ' Uh-huh , yeah . ' Then he said , ' He was Darth Vader when he was fighting .

" After Gandalf exorcises the evil within him , he goes through a hangover from being possessed , full of doubt and full of conservative thought . He 's not the hero king he used to be . Eventually he gains his strength back . " <p> * Actors as script collaborators . " There is a line in the film where Theoden is grieving for his son . He turns and says , ' No parent should have to bury their child . ' I told them , ' I want to put this in . ' The lady who said that to me lost her daughter in a terrorist attack in Northern Ireland . " <p> * Had he read the books before ? " I have a copy given to me as a birthday present in 1977 .

You see the veins under his skin , and there are scabs in the wig . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to an X-Files convention ( he guest-starred as a psychic serial killer ) , and I think X-Files was about as huge as anything I 've seen . But then I went to another convention ( to promote Rings ) and got a standing ovation for Wormtongue , and no one had even seen it yet . " <p> * What is Christopher Lee like ? " This guy knows everyone on planet Earth , and he won World War II , and he is the best swordsman , and it 's all true . He is a genuinely remarkable human being .
