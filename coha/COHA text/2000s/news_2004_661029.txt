<p> Each year tens of millions of people plop onto America 's beaches to bask and bake in the sun . But the question they increasingly face is : " Do I dare go into the water ? " <p> Not because it 's too cold or because they fear an encounter with " Jaws , " but because it might just be too dirty . <p> Consider : <p> * Over the past decade , signs like " Danger . Beach Closed " have become more common as the number of beach closings and water-quality advisories has increased more than fourfold . <p> * Those numbers are likely to rise even more this summer as beach water comes under a new federal microscope . The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) will begin enforcing a 2000 revision of the Clean Water Act that requires states to monitor water quality at many more beaches and more frequently than at present - and to adopt more rigorous and uniform testing standards . <p> * As coastal development continues to spread in the United States , beaches may become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contaminated groundwater , according to new research . That finding , if confirmed by further research , could provide new insights into how to battle beach pollution , which has baffled researchers up to now . In one survey , nearly two-thirds of beach closures and advisories in 2002 were chalked up to " unknown sources . " <p> In fact , the entire subject of beach pollution remains murky , largely because of a lack of data . For example : Of the 5,792 beaches in 30 states ( including the Great Lakes states ) tracked by the EPA , just 56 percent are monitored . And as of the end of April , only nine of those states had adopted the monitoring standards that EPA expects to impose by month 's end . <p> So while the US has made progress in cleaning up some pollution , and its beaches remain cleaner than those of many developing nations , researchers can only guess whether - and how rapidly - the overall picture is deteriorating . <p> " The beach-water situation nationally is probably worse or maybe the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mark Gold , executive director of Heal the Bay , a Santa Monica group that independently grades California beach waters . " The key reason is the nation 's lack of progress in dealing with runoff and nonpoint-source pollution , " such as lawn fertilizer , pet waste , and other pollutants . <p> Coastal waters are generally in " fair to poor condition , " says the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , an environmental lobbying group that has focused on beach-water quality . Another indicator : Only 45 percent of lakes , rivers , and coastal waters monitored by states were clean enough for fishing or swimming in 2000 , according to EPA testimony before Congress in 2002 . Environmental critics like the NRDC say the Bush administration has undercut beach-water quality with a series of moves that loosen requirements for sewage treatment . <p> But the picture is n't all gloomy . Take the beach-closing data . It 's true that in 2002 , the latest year for which the NRDC has data , there were 12,184 days of closings and advisories . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times the total a decade earlier . But even the NRDC says that much of the increase is due to better testing and reporting . <p> California beach waters have improved under intensive efforts in recent years to divert runoff to sewage plants , Dr. Gold says . And pollution- control efforts under the Clean Water Act have improved the overall water quality in the US over the past 30 years , most experts agree . During the ' 90s , for instance , less sewage and overflow entered US coastal waters because cities upgraded treatment plants and extended sewage discharge pipes farther offshore . <p> Yet coastal areas are under growing pressure from residential and commercial development . In 1996 , just over half the US population lived in such areas and by 2015 , they 'll add another 25 million people , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates . <p> This intense development creates an increasing quantity of pesticides , oil , and other nonpoint-source pollutants that get washed into the ocean . Meanwhile , coastal wetlands that once filtered this runoff have been decimated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of its historical coastal wetlands , according to the California Coastal Conservancy , a state agency . And as cities like Los Angeles have channeled runoff , fewer pollutants are absorbed into remaining wetlands and instead are washed into the ocean and then onto the beach . <p> Five years ago , a combination of such factors hit Huntington Beach , one of America 's most popular and surfable beaches . Clean for years , the Orange County , Calif. , beach was closed much of that summer by bad water . Area businesses lost millions of dollars and beachgoers complained bitterly , sparking a search for answers . <p> That meant putting Ken Theisen , one of a growing number of beach-water sleuths , on the case . An environmental scientist for the Santa Ana region of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board , he tracked down sewage and other pollution , sending TV cameras into sewers to spot leaky pipes that municipalities could then patch . In all , he identified 2.5 million gallons of daily runoff full of fertilizer and pet waste , along the eight-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Last year , for the first time in several years , Huntington was not ranked among the state 's Top 10 " beach bummers , " as rated by Heal the Bay . Yet Dr. Theisen is flummoxed by a four-mile stretch rated only a " C " by Heal the Bay . <p> " We 've reduced pollutants on this beach by 90 percent since 1999 ... and still we 've got a problem , " he says . " There are times where , yes , I 've pulled my hair out wondering what the heck can this be ? " During low tides each month , the beach is often inexplicably inundated with bacteria and must be closed - although there is no apparent source for the sewage pollution . <p> It 's part of a nationwide mystery . The NRDC survey found that " unknown sources " were responsible for 62 percent of the beach closings and advisories in 2002 . By contrast , polluted runoff caused 29 percent . <p> Enter another scientific sleuth , Alexandria Boehm , an avid surfer and relentless research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Huntington mystery , she even tasted suspect groundwater to search for clues . <p> " Yeah , it was risky , but sometimes we 've got to have fun , " says the Stanford University environmental engineer . " It was a dare by some of my students . Actually , it tasted really sweet . " <p> After spending July evenings in the Huntington surf collecting 11 tons of water from different depths , she and colleagues began to unravel the mystery . In a paper published in May in an academic journal , the group pointed to the possibility that contaminated groundwater beneath the beach could be the culprit . High in nitrates , which could support bacteria growth , it was being sucked through the sand and into the surf zone by low tides that created a kind of hydrologic pump . <p> Theisen and others say they are n't convinced that low-tide groundwater flow is the culprit . Most testing of groundwater under the beach has n't shown high bacteria counts , he says . <p> But others contend Dr. Boehm 's findings may help explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North Carolina , we have these multimillion dollar houses near beaches , many of them on septic systems , " says Rachel Noble , marine biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . " You could have a situation where groundwater is leached out through the sand at a beach through the tidal cycle . " She is working to develop biological tracers of contaminants . <p> Such research is encouraging to Stephen Leatherman , director of the laboratory for coastal research at Florida International University in Miami . He 's established the National Healthy Beaches Campaign , a three-year-old project about to release the names of 80 beaches that his group can " certify " as " healthy beaches . " " Dr. Beach , " as students sometimes call him , has traveled to more than 1,000 US beaches and many abroad . <p> Despite his concerns about overdevelopment , he says US beaches still are among the cleanest he 's seen in the world . <p> He recalls a resort on an island off the coast of Thailand . One of the hotel rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finding that odd , he traced the sewage lagoon out back to a river that wound its way to the ocean . The reason for the antiflush rule , he speculates , was that it would wash back onto the beach - a visible indicator of otherwise hidden pollution . " It looked like a beautiful tropical paradise . But that stuff was going straight out into the water . I did n't go swimming . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
