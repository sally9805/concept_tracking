PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> In this 1980 interview , the renowned journalist Faruqi Mehtar summarized popular notions among Muslims about Muslim trade and traders in Natal . Similar ideas are echoed today from mosque pulpits in South Africa by religious leaders who contrast the greed and materialism of present-day traders with the pristine habits of their predecessors . Given the difficulty with oral history , due partly to problems associated with memory , and the fact that certain myths are repeated so often that they are accepted without question , 2 this article examines the veracity of these commonly held sentiments . Are they an idealization of the past or do they reflect reality ? There have been several studies of Indian traders in Natal during the colonial period. 3 This paper variously augments earlier studies , challenges some conclusions , and increases our understanding of trade among Gujarati migrants . It is based on archival materials not previously examined in detail , including , in particular , the " Estates of the Dead , " a very rich source that included copies of last wills and testaments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit margins , and credit patterns . Other valuable sources included insolvent estates and court records . The life histories and business practices that emerge from these sources underscore the lived reality of Gujarati traders and deconstruct myths passed from generation to generation . <p> It is well documented that Indian settlement in colonial Natal originated with the importation of indentured workers from 1860 to work on sugar plantations and coal mines. 4 These initial flows were supplemented from the early 1870s by " free " migrants from Gujarat on the west coast of India . They were termed " passengers " because they came of their own free will and expense , and were subject to the ordinary laws of the Colony. 5 While passengers were numerically too small to alter the overall working-class character and low-income status of Indian settlers , they aroused the ire of Whites as a result of their dominant role in Indian social , political , and economic life . It was also because of the success of many traders that the image of the alien , affluent , and exploitative Indian trader became ubiquitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gujarati traders will be explored in this article , including their sources of commercial and economic information , the involvement of their extended families , their relationship with African clients , and their business structures and practices . This study is set within the broader economic and politico-institutional processes in colonial Natal that influenced the opportunity structures of immigrant enterprise . Gujarati Capitalists and Transnational Linkages <p> Gujarati traders began arriving in Natal from the early 1870s . The first traders relocated from Mauritius because of better business opportunities , but subsequent migration was directly from Gujarat to Natal . They dominated " Indian " trade within a decade . The Wragg Commission of 1885 reported that " Arabs " were rapidly replacing ex-indentured Indians in retail trade in " every part of the Colony . " 6 In a 1911 " Dialogue between two friends , " Udayshanker explained to Manharram : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Larger Indian merchants were involved in retail and wholesale trade , import and export , real estate , and shipping . Traders like Aboobaker Amod , Dada Abdoolla , and Dawud Mahomed were well connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mauritius , Bombay , Calcutta , and Madras . They were part of a trading network that consisted of a center where capital was raised , and scattered settlements of traders and employees . In some instances , migrants kept close links with the center . " Goods , credit , information , and men ( since few women migrated ) circulated in this network . " Pioneers sent back word on opportunities in colonies , the capital required to start business , and goods and services in demand ; in short , the " secrets of the trade . " 8 Larger companies were involved in intra-network and intra-firm transactions , as well as business with outsiders. 9 Intra-net work transactions concerned sales to other Indian companies in Mauritius and East Africa ; intra-firm transactions involved sales from Calcutta to subsidiaries in Natal ; while transactions with outsiders consisted mainly of trade with producers in Calcutta . Larger traders opened branches in India because of problems with Indian business houses . These included the refusal of Indian businesses to send goods to their counterparts in Natal on credit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do business without capital ; higher rates of exchange on checking accounts in India because banks were reluctant to conduct money transactions ; merchandise being spoiled because of improper packing ; arbitrary price increases ; and the unwillingness of Indian companies to send samples. 10 Having branches in India allowed traders to control the supply chain and reduce transaction costs . This was important in the highly competitive Natal economy . <p> Aboobaker Amod , Dada Abdoolla , and other large merchants represented companies with international links spanning Natal , Transvaal , India , Mozambique , and Mauritius . In Natal , they extended their influence in local and regional markets . Aboobaker Amod , the first passenger to settle in Natal , had interests in Bombay where his panner was his cousin Hajee Ismail . Dada Abdoolla and Co. was exceptional , with its 15 branches in Durban , Pretoria , Johannesburg , Heidelburg , Potchefstroom , Rustenburg , Zeerust , Umzinto , Umzimkulu , and Mauritius . The family also had business interests in Porbander . The principal partner in Dada Abdoolla and Co. was Abdoolla Adam Jhaveri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paruk , one of four brothers to settle in Natal , had a troubled marriage with a white woman , Olga Rachel . After his divorce in 1913 , he returned to India where he opened A.M. Paruk Wholesalers and Exporters in Calcutta . The Calcutta branch supplied merchandise to the family business in India in Natal . A.M. Moosa of in India who had settled in Natal in the mid-1880s , sent his son Ismail to Bombay in 1914 . Ismail supplied goods to the Durban branch . Dawud Mahomed of Kathor emigrated to Mauritius in the mid-1870s to work for Ismail Mamoojee &; Co . In the early 1880s he opened a business in Delagoa Bay , Mozambique . He was joined by younger brother Cassim who managed the business when Mahomed relocated to Durban in 1884 to start Bombay House . Cassim managed the business in Delagoa Bay until his death in 1896. 11 B. Ebrahim Ismail &; Co. was formed by three cousins , I.M. Bobat , Ebrahim Asmal , and Ismail Asmal , who were nephews of Dawud Mahomed . Another cousin , G.M. Asmal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hassan Mamoojee &; Co. , which supplied " coolie stores " ( as items imported for Indians were known ) to B. Ebrahim Ismail &; Co. in Natal , as well as clients in Mauritius and East Africa . G.M. Asmal lived in Calcutta for almost two decades . His six children , in fact , were born there . He returned to Natal in 1932 when B. Ebrahim Ismail &; Co. became insolvent. 12 <p> The main sources of " coolie stores " - such as dahl ( or dholl ) , ghee , rice , and dhotis - were Mauritius , India , and , to a lesser extent , England . Merchants relied heavily on contacts in Mauritius for merchandise until the 1890s . The Mauritian firm of Ajum Goolam Hoosen and Co. , for example , supplied dahl , ghee , dates , and haberdashery to Aboobaker Amod . Once established , Gujarati traders imported directly from England and India . Moosa Hajee Cassim personally visited England to purchase goods and bought the Crescent in 1895 to expedite delivery. 13 Snoek , a popular item among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 Calcutta was an important supplier throughout , while Bombay 's importance increased from the 1890s . There was a resurgence in trade with Mauritius in 1904 and 1905 . <p> Purchasing and export operations were based at several locations in India . Finance for the international trading operations of merchants was arranged with exchange banks in Bombay , which also served as a center for redispatching goods imported from the Far East . The traffic of Bombay City was gathered from the Presidency itself , as well as Rajputana and Central India , the Central Provinces , United Provinces , and Hyderabad . The main items were oilseeds , wheat , food grains , and cotton goods. 15 Calcutta was another important source of merchandise , where many merchants had retail establishments for the large European population . The port in Calcutta served as a shipment point on the route to Natal for jute , rice , oilseeds tea , pulse , ghee , cotton goods , salt , and kerosene , which were obtained from Bengal , United Provinces , and Assam . Madras was the main source for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Unlike smaller retailers who benefited from ethnic concentration in Natal , these larger wholesalers were not spatially bounded . They catered for broader Indian , African , and white markets throughout the Colony . There is little evidence , however , of them selling to white firms . Indian traders were not known to specialize or be innovative ; they focused on retail trade . According to a contemporary observer : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Several Natal traders bought ships in the 1890s , following in the footsteps of Memon families who were prominent in shipping in Porbander until they were superseded by the British in the 19th century . Dada Abdoolla and Moosa Hajee Cassim began running steamers between Bombay and Natal . Cassim bought the lolani in 1895 and renamed it Crescent . Not to be outdone , Dada Abdoolla bought the wood barquentine Merritt in May 1895 and sailed it in the coastal waters of the Cape Colony , Natal , and Portuguese East Africa , as far north as Beira , and south to Port Elizabeth. 18 In August 1895 Dada Abdoolla and Co. bought the Courland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ships making the voyage from Natal to Bombay traveled via Mozambique and Mauritius , where they picked up passengers and sugar. 20 <p> Other traders without transnational linkages possessed enough capital and know-how to open multiple branches . In the case of partnerships , different partners often looked after each store ; otherwise salaried managers were employed . A.M. Omar opened his main store in Ladysmith in the mid-1880s , and branch stores in Charlestown and Blaubank in 1894 . Most goods for Charlestown and Blaubank were sent directly from Durban , but " soft " goods were sent from Ladysmith. 21 M.E. Lakhi 's main store was M.E. Lakhi , General Merchant in Greytown , while he opened branches in New Hanover , Umvoti , Weenen , and Kranskop . M.A. Goga 's principal store was in Ladysmith , with branches in Kokstad , Harrismith , Besters , Matawana , and Pretoria . Hoosen Cassim &; Co , had three branches in Durban ( West Street , Grey Street and Pine Street ) , as well as stores in Maritzburg , Ladysmith , Harrismith , and Biggarsberg . <p> Bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonial Indian News , and Indian Opinion , as well as the Natal Almanac , a business register that appeared annually . Dada Abdoolla , Aboobaker Amod , Ismail Mamoojee , and Hajee Mahomed Haji Dada were among Gujarati traders to advertise in the Almanac . Ads reflected the size and status of companies . Smaller businesses placed matchbox-sized ads , simply reflecting their name and address , while larger companies like M.C. Camroodeen and M.C. Anglia had advertisements that were up to six times larger . They included detailed product lists as well as photographs of the premises . Some traders specialized in particular products and underscored this in their ads , S.P. Mahomed &; Co. and Ebrahim Camroodeen &; Co. were tobacconists ; N.M.A. Karrim and Suliman Essop were hardware specialists ; Aboobaker and Bros , and M.C. Camroodeen imported ladies and children 's clothing ; Shaik Himed was a shipping agent . <p> Gujarati traders helped shape the Natal economy by creating new openings . They extended trade throughout Natal , often at high risk to person and capital , The discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetus to railway construction and the development of the harbor in Natal . The link between the port in Natal and the Transvaal Republic was completed in 1891 when the railway line reached the Transvaal border at Charlestown . A line was also built from Ladysmith to the coal mining areas of Dundee and Newcastle . Some passenger migrants moved from Durban to other parts of Natal following the railway to the Transvaal and settling in towns like Ladysmith and Charlestown , or in the coal mining interior of Northern Natal in Dundee and Newcastle . Still others settled in sugar producing areas like Lower Tugela , Inanda , Umlazi , Alexandra , and Lower Umzikulu along the Natal coast , and tea , maize , and wattle growing midlands in villages like Ixopo , Richmond , New Hanover , Camperdown , Kranskop , Estcourt , and Underberg . Modest Beginnings : The Class Structure of Migrants <p> Gujarati traders were broadly segmented into large capitalists with transnational connections , small retailers , salaried managers , and shop assistants . Large wholesalers were the exception . The majority of traders had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Known in the literature as dukawallahs ( small retailers ) , they depended heavily on other segments of the opportunity structure . They started businesses requiring small capital outlay and continued mainly as survivalist entrepreneurs . Brothers Hoosen and Amod Chupty were among the first Indian traders in Ladysmith . Amod 's application for a license to trade on the farm of white farmer G.P Pretorius had been refused ; his appeal to the principal under-secretary illustrates how difficult life was for many pioneers : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Brother Hoosen opened H.E . Chupty in 1880 . The business was taken over by his son Ismail in 1905. 23 Ismail and his sons Amod , Ebrahim , and Cassim transferred to Colenso in 1923 but suffered heavy losses and became insolvent . They returned to Ladysmith where they rented a store from E.M . Gangat from October 1924 . Life was difficult . Amod lived in a wood and iron room behind the store , Ebrahim rented two rooms at the back of an adjoining fruit shop , while another room was rented nearby for their father . The Chuptys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relative , C.S. Asmal , took over the stock and agreed to pay creditors 75 per month . The Chuptys , in turn , were to repay him 2 per month. 24 Insolvencies were common and few traders had benevolent relatives to assist them . <p> Despite the availability of ex-indentured and colonial-born Indian workers as well as Africans , the labor strategy of Gujarati traders centered on importing cheap family and kin labor from their villages of origin . These young workers often had no retail trade experience , as they came from a farming background . Traders rarely employed Indians from an indentured background . Superintendent R.C. Alexander , for example , told the Wragg Commission in June 1885 that " the proprietors or managers of Arab stores are assisted mostly by their relatives .. The Arabs employ very few Indians in town , only about 10 in all , and they are free men and are employed only as labourers . " 25 G.H. Miankhan &; Co. was the first Muslim firm to employ colonial-born Indians . Shortly before a visit to India in 1919 , Miankhan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sporting Club . He told the audience : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The prominence given to Miankhan 's decision underscores the fact that traders rarely employed migrants from an indentured background . Traders might have felt that fellow villagers would be more trustworthy , similar in cultural background and easier to communicate with ( since few migrants spoke English ) , and could probably make them work harder because of the dependency relationship . Furthermore , traders were expected to provide opportunities for village members . The testimony of Ismail Bawa , shop assistant to Hajee Ismail Khan of Dundee , to the Losses Enquiry Commission in 1900 shows the importance of patronage . Bawa joined his brother in hawking in Pretoria in 1899 . They were poor and found it difficult to earn a decent living . He contacted a relative in Dundee , who provided employment. 27 Issa Hajee Soomar who had stores in Durban and Ladysmith filed an immigration affidavit in 1899 to facilitate the entry of fellow villagers Joosub Hajee Vally , Mahomed Dada , and Moosa Dada ( all in their early twenties , for whom Natal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . 28 The immigration records are filled with such applications . <p> Shop assistants made up a large proportion of passengers . The largest traders entered into contractual relationships with their employees . In comparison to indentured workers , these contracts were of one-year duration , the return passage was provided unconditionally after completion of the contract , and employees received a higher wage . Like indentured Indians , many of the ordinary expenses were taken care of by employers and most lived in overcrowded and unhygienic accommodation on the commercial premises . A contract signed between Essop Mahomed and Dada Abdoola &; Co. before the Port Shepstone magistrate in 1893 stipulated that the duration was one year ; wages were 25 per annum to be paid at the end of the contract after expenses and loans were deducted ; the employee could be transferred to any of the company 's branches at the same wage ; the employer was to provide board and lodging ; if the employee left the service before the expiration of the contract , his entire salary was forfeited and he was liable for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misbehaved , " he could be dismissed " at once and his salary . forfeited. " 29 <p> While the contract was weighted in favor of the employer , at least Dada Abdoola 's employees knew what was expected . Others workers in informal arrangements were extremely vulnerable . One elderly informant , for example , mentioned that his father was sent to work for family in Richmond . When he was returning home for a break , he " foolishly " asked for wages . The employer informed him that he was in debt for 9 for board and lodging after his wages had been deducted ! White traders cited low wages as one of the reasons they could not compete with Indians . George L. Russel , a draper in Ladysmith , claimed in 1905 that Gujarati traders were paying 3 to 4 per month while whites paid shop assistants between 14 and 20 . Mahatma Gandhi countered that most Indian shop assistants were unskilled and untrained , few could speak English , and were provided with board and lodging . Gandhi added that Indians were successful because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single wood and iron room at the rear of the store , while traders lived above the store . The spatial configuration of the family business-cum-residence reduced expenses and permitted traders to spend longer hours at work . Local health authorities objected to the condition of many premises . For example , W.S. Daugherty , inspector of nuisances , reported in 1889 on Muslim-owned stores in Gardiner and Pine streets in Durban : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Daugherty added that each store had a window which was " not capable of being opened at any time , none of the sleeping rooms had windows , partitions between the shop and bedroom were made of sacking , kitchens were dilapidated , and toilets were dysfunctional : " all the premises are unfit for human habitation. " 31 Many ordinary workers lived in decrepit , overcrowded rooms without adequate cooking or toilet facilities . Daugherty pressured the mayor to introduce regulations in 1888 " to compel the Indian population to observe the rules of health . " The MOH fixed the number of persons who could sleep in each room ; food was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every living and sleeping room shall be opened and kept open to their full width throughout the day " ; floors to be swept daily and washed at least once a week ; clothing and linen to be washed regularly ; wood to be used to partition the sleeping room from the store , and , finally , goats , dogs , fowls , and ducks could not be kept in the sleeping room. 32 Partnerships <p> The largest pioneer businesses were partnerships , such as Aboobaker Amod &; Co. ( c. 1875 ) , Ismail Mamojee &; Co. ( 1884 ) , Tayob Abdoola ( 1884 ) , Ismael Amod &; Co. ( 1889 ) , Dada Abdoola &; Co. ( 1879 ) , M.A. and G.A . Bassa ( 1892 ) , M. Ebrahim Amod &; Co. ( 1893 ) , Hoosen Cassim &; Co. ( 1893 ) , and B. Ebrahim Ismail &; Co. ( 1900 ) . Partnerships were attractive for several reasons . First , they made it easier to raise capital to compete with larger white or Indian firms . The first source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and National banks were reluctant to extend credit to them , whether just from racism or because of their lack of a credit history . They mostly relied on their own capital and credit from other traders . Partnerships allowed risks to be shared , an important consideration given the cyclical depressions in Natal in the early 1880s , mid-1890s , and in the immediate aftermath of the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902 . Partnerships also allowed traders with transnational interests to go on extended visits to India where their immediate families lived . <p> Partnerships took several forms . Members sometimes invested equal capital and entered into an equitable arrangement . Alternatively , those with capital sometimes recruited members of their extended kin as " working partners , " who provided skilled labor in the form of commercial experience and knowledge of local markets . Partnerships were always formal and legally binding . Being coreligionists and co-villagers did not mean that the bond of trust was taken for granted . Profit sharing depended on the amount of capital brought into the business as well as the day-to-day involvement of individual partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts of law , though this was contrary to Quranic injunction that even if living in a majority nonMuslim country , Muslims should appoint a qazi ( judge ) to arbitrate disputes , and that those who took recourse in secular law were " hypocrites . " The chief characteristics of partnerships are evident in the many individual histories of companies and traders . <p> Dada Abdoolla and Co. was one of the earliest and biggest Indian partnerships , established by Dada Abdoolla and nine of his brothers and cousins in 1879 in Durban . By 1890 the company had 15 branches in Durban , Pretoria , Johannesburg , Heidelburg , Potchefstroom , Rustenburg , Zeerust , Umzinto , Umzimkulu , and Mauritius . Dada Abdoolla 's cousin Tayob Haji Khan Mahomed managed the Transvaal branches from Pretoria . The company secured contracts with plantation owners and government to supply rice and other Indian staples . In return , they took sugar at cost for sale in their stores. 33 They imported goods from India , England , and Germany , and owned several ships . Tension emerged between Dada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . Tayob 's family purchased the seven shops in Transvaal on 31 July 1890 for 42,500 and reconstituted it into Tayob Hajee Abdoolla and Co . They paid 18,500 in cash and gave 24 " promissory notes " of 1,000 each for the balance . Tayob stopped paying after 18 months . Dada Abdoolla sued him for 24,739.12 , comprising unpaid notes , loans , outstanding rent , and 6 percent compound interest . This dispute has wider importance because Dada Abdoolla invited Mahatma Gandhi to Natal to assist in the case . Gandhi convinced Tayob to take the matter to arbitration . Arbitrator John Livingston ruled in favor of Dada Abdoolla , but Gandhi implored him to accept payment in installments to avoid Tayob becoming insolvent. 34 <p> The Natal Provincial Gazette ( TNPG ) was filled annually with notices of dissolved partnerships . There were many reasons for this . Partners who accumulated sufficient knowledge of the local market , or saved enough capital , or had older children , preferred to dissolve the partnership and open their own businesses . The termination of partnerships could be amicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Muslim , family against family , in expensive court cases , such as the one involving Dada Abdoolla . There were many similar cases . In fact , Gandhi 's first cases in Natal involved Amod Maiter of Verulam , who was accused of failing to honor two promissory notes of 25 each to Hassen Maiter , son of his late cousin and former business partner Mohamed Maiter . Amod and Mohamed had been partners from 1886 . Amod , a working partner , had 30 percent share in the business while Mohamed , who had invested 859 , was the majority shareholder . Mohamed died while visiting Surat in 1887 . Amod charged a " commission " of 30 to carry on the business until Mohamed 's minor son Hassen arrived in January 1890 . Hassen was accompanied by an uncle , I.M. Lavangi , who informed Amod that they wished to dissolve the partnership and open a store in Stanger . Amod did not have cash to pay Hassen , so a panchayat ( " council of five " ) chaired by Dawud Mahomed convened a meeting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dispute arose when Hassen claimed that he had not been paid the last two promissory notes for 25 each . Amod claimed that he had paid Hassen cash in June 1891 . During the dispute Amod hired people to beat Hassan and two of his cousins , for which he was found guilty of assault and fined ten shillings . When court proceedings began in February 1895 , Gandhi argued that because the agreement had not been registered with the Master of the Supreme Court , it was illegal and could not be enforced . Arthur Foss , appearing for Hassen , produced counter-evidence that Amod had kept the 50 as security because he stood guarantor for Lavangi to purchased goods for his Stanger store . However , Gandhi successfully attacked the validity of the agreement and won the case . Later he wondered in his published autobiography why Amod would stand guarantee for Lavangi without security , and why a " shrewd Surti merchant " would pay 50 gold crowns to Hassen without a witness. 35 <p> Some partnerships were terminated amicably as the circumstances of partners changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Omar and Suleman . This gave Moosa the luxury of spending a decade in India from 1898 to 1908 . When Moosa settled permanently in Natal , Omar and Suleman retired in India . A " Memorandum of Agreement " dissolved the partnership on 31 August 1914 . Omar and Suleman " ceded and transferred all their rights , titles , interests , claim and demand " to Moosa who paid each 4,000 over 18 months from January 1915. 36 The example of Omar and Suleman and many others illustrate that as many passenger migrants returned to India as those who made Natal their permanent home . Partnerships could also be redrawn as circumstances changed . G.H. Miankhan and his brother Adamji of Ahmedabad established G.H. Miankhan and Co. in Field Street in the mid-1880s . They were joined by their brothers Chandabhay and Nanabhay in the mid-1890s , who were salaried " shop assistants . " However , in 1905 they claimed a share in the business and properties owned by the company because they had contributed to its growth . On the instruction of their father that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement to " display good faith and reach an amicable settlement . " The new agreement made it clear that Chandabhay and Nanabhay did not have " any claim or interest " in the business but gave each a property belonging to the company " in full settlement of all claims " up to 5 October 1906 . Six properties were kept by Adamji and G.H. Miankhan . From 6 October 1906 , the brothers formed a new partnership in the reconstituted G.H. Miankhan and Co. with each having an equal share. 37 Hoosen Cassim &; Co. provides another example of partnerships being modified as the situation changed . The company had been formed in June 1883 by H.C . Coovadia , the senior partner , and his brother M.C. Coovadia . A third brother , E.G. Coovadia , joined in 1894 but did not have a share in the firm . The brothers formed a fresh deed of partnership in 1925 to " give recognition to other family members . " Profits were to be shared as follows : 6/16 to H.C . Coovadia , 5/16 to M.C. Coovadia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karodia , H.C . Coovadia 's son-in-law . However , E.G. Coovadia and Karodia were " not to be considered partners of the firm " ; they were to share in profits " without control in the business and without voice in the management or disposition of the business . " The new arrangement could be changed at the sole discretion of H.C . and M.C. Coovadia. 38 <p> An important advantage of partnerships was that they allowed transnational traders to move between Natal and India , an important consideration for those who , at least initially , saw migration to Natal as temporary and retained family and business links in India , H.C . and M.C. Coovadia arrived in Natal in the 1880s but were only joined by their families around 1918 . During this period , they took turns living in India and managing the business in Natal. 39 This was not uncommon . The five-year partnership formed by M.C. Anglia , Mahomed Salaybhai , and Mahomed Patel on 1 August 1903 illustrates several characteristics of partnerships . Anglia contributed 2,301 and Salaybhai 2,064 , while Patel was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Salaybhai , and a liability of the firm , but could not be withdrawn until the termination of the partnership . Anglia and Salaybhai each received 3/8 of the profit , and Patel 2/8 . Anglia and Salaybhai were paid 300 per annum and Patel 100 . The partnership sanctioned travel to India : " Any partner desiring to go to India on a holiday may do so with mutual consent of the other partners and when such absence shall not exceed a period of more than one year unless mutually agreed for a longer period . " All three partners spent extensive time in India where their families lived ; further , the arrangement allowed Anglia to participate in passive resistance for which he was imprisoned in 1908 , and to edit Indian Views , a newspaper that he started in 1914. 40 <p> This partnership highlighted another problem . Natal was not to Patel 's liking and he migrated to Rangoon in 1917 ; Salaybhai , who had arrived in 1898 , returned to India in 1913 ; Anglia , the remaining partner , died in 1919 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Cassim was very young. 41 Several other traders suffered a similar predicament . Dawud Mahomed of Bombay House was one of the richest traders in Durban . His house in Congella could accommodate 50 people in the dining room alone . Gandhi described him as the " most intelligent , resourceful , and independent trader in Natal . " 42 He suffered a massive blow when his son Hoosen died in 1913 at the age of 22 while studying law in England . According to the Natal Mercury , he " has been thoroughly prostrated by the grief . " 43 Mahomed neglected his business and health and died in 1919 . His second son Hussain was too young to take over the business , which became insolvent and the family relied on the good will of other traders for survival. 44 The partnership between Amod Jeewa and Suleman Kharwa , formed in 1899 , suffered a setback when Jeewa died while visiting India in 1901 . His children were too young to participate in the business . Jeewa 's relatives A.M. Haffejee of Estcourt and Ismail Ebrahim of Maritzburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached agreement with Kharwa to dissolve the partnership. 45 Dada Abdoolla &; Co. , the largest company in the 1890s , went into rapid decline from the turn of the century as the principal partner Abdoolla Hajee Adam Jhavary ( 1854-1912 ) did not have any sons , while his only daughter Hawa married in India. 46 The businesses of Aboobaker Amod also declined after his death in 1887 because brother O.H.A. Jhaveri and son Ismail were minors and were left in the custody of Aboobaker 's cousin Haji Dada. 47 Many pioneering businesses suffered a similar fate . A different generation of traders became prominent from the 1910s . They included E.M . Paruk and Co. , C.A. Bassa , Abdool Hai and Amod , Hoosen Cassim and Co. , M.S. Randeree , and A.H . Moosa . <p> Indian traders pooled their expertise to compete more successfully in a racist environment . The Durban Indian Community ( 1890 ) and Natal Indian Congress ( 1894 ) were dominated by traders and focused on getting governments to eradicate anti-Indian policies. 48 Other bodies concentrated on trade issues . On 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offices of M.C. Camroodeen &; Co in Grey Street to form an " Indian Chamber of Commerce " to protect the interests of Indian traders throughout Natal . Ismail Gora of B. Ebrahim Ismail &; Co. was elected chairman and P.V . Sanghavee secretary. 49 In 1910 , Nestle stopped supplying condensed milk to Indian merchants because of protests from white traders . Around a hundred Indian traders joined to form the Natalia Milk Company Ltd. and arranged an alternative supply . The first shipment of 1500 cans arrived on 5 April 1910 . The director of Natalia was Ismail Gora and the secretary S.G. Randeria . Directors included M.C. Coovadia , A.H . Kazi , G.A . Bassa , M.C. Anglia , Dawud Mahomed , P.V . Sanghavee , E.M . Paruk , and Ismail Bayat. 50 Credit and Interest Transactions <p> Some larger traders obtained credit from " official " sources like the Standard and National banks . But most were denied credit by these institutions during the 1880s and 1890s . The Standard Bank urged branch managers to limit transactions with " Arab " and " Banyan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special caution . The hole and corner way in which their businesses are conducted give one a feeling of distrust and they bear a name for utter unscrupulousness if they find themselves in a bad way . " Bank officials conclude that because of this , " an interdependency developed both within the group of elite wealthier merchants and hundreds of small traders in the colony . " 51 The bank 's Natal manager reported in 1891 that there had been " a considerable increase in the number of what are known as Arab traders , whose operations have gradually assumed large dimensions . Our policy has been to discourage advances .. Considerable risk would be run in dealing with them . " 52 Indian traders saw themselves " as a discrete community whose survival depended on co-operation . " 53 They relied on kin , friends , of co-ethnic investors to grow their businesses . According to Padayachee and Morrell , Muslim traders set up variants of " Western banking " partly because Islam forbade interest-taking , and that " mutual trust " among traders resulted in " debt settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way which did not disrupt the harmony of the whole . " 54 Our case studies suggest , on the contrary , that Muslims borrowed heavily on interest , lent money on interest , and did not hesitate to liquidate the estates of fellow Muslims if owed money . Trust was important but was based on rational calculations . It was not automatic just because traders were family members , fellow villagers , or co-religionists . <p> Larger Indian merchants supplied goods on credit and also functioned as bankers . Shaik Emamally and his brother Hoosen Buckas , for example , turned to Chandabhay Miankhan when they wanted to start the Victory Mineral Water Factory . They bonded their property to him for 3,000 in 1922 at 8 percent interest per annum for the period 1922 to 1927 because the Standard Bank was only willing to lend them 2,000 of the 5000 required. 55 The following loans were outstanding at interest of 8 percent to Moosa Hajee Adam Jhavary when he died in 1926. 56 <p> Once white banks realized the value of Indian business , they provided finance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stock as well as property . The Standard Bank , Ladysmith , for example , reported in 1914 that " the principal Indian storekeepers employ a fair amount of capital but as usual with this class of trader , they insist on carrying a very heavy stock which usually results in heavy liabilities . The Indian business done by the branch is profitable and does not appear to carry undesirable risk . " The bank 's client 's included A.M. Omar , H.E . Chupty , M.A. Goga , M.J. Amod , Suliman Dowjee , and Suliman Amla. 57 M.A. Goga was one of the largest traders in Northern Natal and the Standard Bank paid special attention to his account . Inspector Henry Robinson reported on 26 November 1914 that " in spite of warnings , Goga has invested far too freely in town properties .. The setback in trade caused by the war has resulted in decreased sales and he is now straining his credit with ourselves . " The stock at Kokstad , worth 6000 , was not insured . His overdraft in Ladysmith was 3,795 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ municipal value 4,575 , though partly bonded for 1,400 , and over his Ladysmith stock which was insured for 5,000 . Goga 's direct liabilities were about 9,400 , and he had contingent liabilities on bills he backed for M.M. Amod . M.M. Amod owed the National Bank 4,000 " which he is being pressed to reduce . He has a branch business at Newcastle and during my recent visit there I noticed the National Bank returning several of his cheques . " 58 Robinson reported in November 1915 that " should Goga be unable to effect the promised reductions I would suggest that we take a new power to pass a mortgage bond and or general bond over the property and stock , or we take two separate powers , one for the property and the other for the stock . Although no real security it would give us a good hold on Goga who is always inclined to strain his credit . " 59 This method of business was fairly usual among larger traders . <p> Wholesalers like M.C. Camroodeen , A.M. Paruk , P. Dowjee , Amod Bayat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to Indian storekeepers . F.A . Hathorn of the Maritzburg Chamber of Commerce told the Wragg Commission in 1885 that " Arabs import very largely for the supply of other Arabs , and of coolie storekeepers " throughout Natal. 60 In 1898 , for example , M.C. Camroodeen &; Co. was owed 25,000 by 400 storekeepers and hawkers throughout Natal. 61 A government report in August 1898 confirmed that upcountry traders were supported by Durban-based Indian wholesalers. 62 A.S . Goga was owed 3,000 by traders in Northern Natal when he died in 1899. 63 Goga , who was trading in Ladysmith from 1879 , had a very profitable cash and credit-based business . He was a wholesaler to Gujarati traders in Northern Natal like Ismail Amoojee of Driefontein , Adam Fakir Seedat , M.A. Chupty , and Hoosen Dawjee of Ladysmith , Mahomed Makda of Elandslaagte , and Suliman Mahomed Bayat of Kokstad . He also had a thriving retail trade with local African and white farmers . For example , G.E . Robinson and J. Stevenson owed him 9.10 and 2.16 respectively. 64 Baboo Asmal 's anecdote attests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Indian wholesalers were important for Indian traders , the role of white wholesalers must also be acknowledged . An enraged Sir J.L. Hulett , member for Victoria County , complained to the Legislative Assembly on 30 July 1907 that " Arabs can get credit almost to an unlimited extent from various mercantile establishments . I may say truly that they will get credit where respectable Europeans will have that credit refused to them . " 66 Randles Brothers , Payne Bros , John Jardine and Co. , and S. Butcher &; Sons supplied goods to large numbers of Indian traders . Amod Haffejee , who opened two stores in Estcourt in 1893 , started with capital of 75 and was supported by Randies Brothers and Hudson , Turton and Co. , John Jardine and Co. , and S. Butcher and Sons. 67 Indian traders became distributors for white wholesalers whose merchandise they carried to remote comers of Natal , Hathorn corroborated this when he told the Wragg Commission that " the Arabs have cut into trade a good deal , but it is more into the trade of the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of 50 dukawallahs whose estates were assigned in the period 1882 to 1898 , revealed that the top ten creditors included four Indian and six white wholesalers. 69 <p> Trust was important to wholesalers because credit carried heavy risks and had to be earned . Wholesalers trusted smaller traders when , " on the basis of the latter 's reputation , he can reasonably expect the other party to behave in a certain way , conducive to the successful implementation of the transaction . " 70 Information circulated quickly in the community and unreliable traders could be denied credit . Tarnished reputations were difficult to restore . Most agreements were formally binding rather than verbal arrangements. 71 Harry Escombe , future prime minister of Natal , and architect of many anti-Indian policies , was Dada Abdoolla &; Co. ' s senior counsel in Natal . Escombe 's other clients included M.C. Camroodeen and Moosa Hajee Adam Jhavery. 72 That these traders employed an expensive and highly skilled legal mind shows the importance of secular law . <p> Many wholesalers suffered heavy losses due to the failure of creditors defaulting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was owing 725 to Amod Jeewa , D.M. Timol , Moosen Ismail , A.G. Hoosen , and Dawud Mahomed. 73 M. Akoon of Cato Manor , was in debt of 251 to A.M. Tilly , Ajum Goolam Hoosen , Dawud Mahomed , and Hoosen Cassim &; Co. when declared insolvent in 1897. 74 M.M. Paruk , who became insolvent in 1897 , was in debt of 1,300 to M.C. Camroodeen , Ahmed Salejee , Ahmed Mamoojee , Amod Jeewa , A.G. Timol , A.M. Paruk , and D.M. Timol. 75 This corroborates the evidence of F.A . Hathorn to the Wragg Commission that " Arab importers have lost quite as heavily , if not more heavily than European merchants , by people of their own race . I think that the principal cause of the frequent insolvencies , amongst Arabs and coolies , is because they start with no capital . " 76 The experience of B. Ebrahim Ismail &; Co. illustrates how grave the risk could be . At its peak B. Ebrahim Ismail &; Co. was one of the biggest Indian companies and largest importer of rice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to debt totaling 98,000 . Yet the company had book debts of 95,142 , involving several hundred Indian traders , stock valued at 14,266 , and real estate worth 35,000 . There was no hope of recovering the debt however. 77 M.C. Camroodeen and Co. , one of the largest Indian firms in the 1890s , became insolvent in 1912 because its customers failed to honor debts totaling 40,000. 78 The evidence suggests that both Gujarati and white wholesalers were important in the establishment and spread of dukawallahs , with Gujarati traders probably more important in assisting certain family members with limited capital . <p> The Natal Government Gazette regularly published Deeds of Composition of insolvent companies . Relatives sometimes assisted family members so that they could continue trading . When Cassimjee Patel of Dannahuser became insolvent in 1903 , creditors accepted a composition of eleven shillings sterling on the . Promissory Notes in favor of creditors were signed by Patel 's cousin Mahomed Meer of Dundee. 79 Creditors accepted eight shillings in the when Ebrahhn Salijee Motala of Cato Ridge became insolvent in 1906 . This was guaranteed by Motala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Port Shepstone became insolvent in September 1906 , creditors accepted settlement of nine shillings on the pound commencing October 1906 . Promissory notes were guaranteed by Sadeck 's brother Hoosen Vahed of Pinetown. 81 Essop Asmal of Grey Street , who became insolvent in 1907 , ceded his stock-in-trade , moneys , debts , and securities to his brother Cassim Asmal of Bergville , who paid creditors five shillings on the pound. 82 <p> The many cases that ended up in the law courts point to highly complex trade arrangements . Muslim traders did not hesitate to place the estates of other Muslims under provisional sequestration . Moorad Khan of Umgeni Road , for example , was in debt to M.E. Vanker ( 16 ) , Abdool Hay ( 14 ) , and E.M . Paruk ( 10 ) , who sued successfully for his liquidation. 83 Though Islamic injunction prohibited interest , traders imposed this penalty when clients defaulted . Dada Abdoolla , we saw earlier , included 6 percent compound interest when he sued Tayob . In September 1913 , Goolam Suliman asked a relative , M.E. Vanker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material in Vanker 's name , added " commission " of 5 percent , and gave Vanker ten promissory notes to repay the amount . On 13 December 1913 , Suliman signed a mortgage bond for 300 in favor of Vanker , arising " from and being moneys lent and advanced , promissory notes , balance of account or arising from any source of debt whatever . " It provided for interest at 6 percent per annum , and for Vanker to sue for recovery of outstanding monies if Suliman defaulted on payment . Suliman defaulted in January 1914 and Vanker successfully sued for Suliman 's insolvency. 84 Mahomed Vally of Camperdown brought a civil summons against Ebrahim Osman of Georgedale in the Camperdown court in April 1904 for 39 as well as the cost of the civil suit and interest on the claim. 85 <p> Small retailers also extended credit to their customers and often experienced great difficulty in recovering outstanding debts . Ismail Hassim of Rosedale was one such trader . Four Indians indentured to Tom Homer completed their fiveyear terms in July 1909 and were to depart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Protector Mason on 27 July 1909 to recover 10 owed to him . Hassim 's desperation underscored the plight of small traders : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> This was outside the protector 's jurisdiction and Hassim failed to recover his money. 86 Civil Record Books for most districts contain examples of Indian workers in debt to dukawallahs . Debts ranged from 10s to 100. 87 This gave rise to stereotypes . Reverend James Scott of Impolweni wrote to the under-secretary for native affairs in 1907 that " an Arab or Turk named Pathan who keeps a store at Albert Falls is gradually getting the whole native population into his clutches , by lending money . I have good reason to believe that he charges up to 640% interest . In the interest of the Natives I do not think that this man 's licence should be renewed . " 88 Dr. Nundy of Maritzburg wrote to the protector on 23 November 1905 that the PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Protector Polkinghorne replied that he had chatted " on many occasions with free Indians and never has this subject been mentioned . " PREFORMATTED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most traders concentrated on an Indian clientele because spatial patterns were segregated . Indians constituted a " natural " market as traders were socially embedded in these communities . Some traders broke with the spatial logic of the ethnic enclave and focused on an African and white customers in rural Natal . They most likely moved because of saturation in spatial markets . They dispersed into isolated rural areas where they had few guarantees , little security , and were economically vulnerable . They were a crucial cog in the colonial economy . The protector observed in 1886 that " were the Indian element withdrawn from the Colony for a single month the whole fabric of industrial business and domestic comfort would be little short of paralysed . " 90 Ladysmith 's mayor D. Sparks complained to the colonial secretary in 1904 that " the whole of the Kaffir trade is vested in the hands of Indian traders . At one time a considerable amount of business was transacted between the European merchant and the Native but this has now entirely drifted away . " 91 <p> Indians traded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Africans in locations were primarily agriculturalists , except in Northern Natal where they worked as migrants on coalmines . Indian traders outperformed their African competitors because they had better access to capital , business expertise , and ready sources of supply , while they performed better than whites by providing a personalized service , cheaper prices , and longer hours . Many even went from kraal to kraal hawking tobacco , mealies , mats , paraffin , skin hides , chickens , and eggs . In Greytown , the commissioner for native affairs reported in 1915 that I.M. Paruk was trading in neighboring African locations , using African kraals as depots . He stored goods at the kraals and traveled with two wagons from location to location selling mealies , salt , beans , " kafir corn , " and sweet potatoes for cash or bartering them for skins , hides , and chickens . Local Africans were also hired to sell on his behalf. 92 <p> The language of trade was Fanagalo , a mixture of English , Zulu , and Indian languages. 93 Some traders opened stores on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store in 1897 on the farm Kirkintullock about ten miles from Ladysmith , which belonged to induna Joseph Kumalo . Seedat started with capital of 100 and built his business on goods supplied on credit by Goga . His stock was worth 655 by March 1900 . The growth , he explained , was due to the rinderpest disease which destroyed African agriculture : " I admit to the large amount of money made in a very short time to good times in mealies at the time of the rinderpest . " 94 When Seedat died in 1925 , his book debts included 230 African customers who owed 540 . Ezra Msimang , the highest individual debtor , owed 57 , and other African debtors were listed. 95 A.M. Sardiwalla had a store on the farm Hlatikulu in Waschbank . At the time of his death , African creditors included Alfred Dhlangalala , Francis Magasela , Absolom Simelane , John Kunene , Geoffrey Miepa , Beauty Khumalo , and Tabitha Hlubu. 96 The Meer family had a strong presence in Dundee and Waschbank from the late 1880s . A descendent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A.M. Malekjee opened a business at Raemore , Dundee , in May 1898 . He obtained stock from Indian storekeepers in Dundee , except for mealies which he bought from Africans . Trade in mealies ( corn ) was very profitable . When his store was raided by Afrikaner soldiers in November 1899 , Malekjee gave his books of account and stock to a local " kaffir " for safekeeping . The stock was " recovered " when he returned in May 1900. 98 Indian traders in Weenen rented land on Afrikaner farms like Golden Valley , Zwaagershoek , Mount Moriah , and Vriesgewacht . They dominated rural African trade . Peter Paterson , the resident magistrate of Weenen , reported in 1886 that the " Native trade is almost entirely now monopolised by Arab and Indian traders and hawkers . " In nearby Umsinga , almost 50 Indians were trading in the township of Pomeroy in 1887 , in contrast to three white traders . Most bartered beads , cotton fabric , blankets , and clothing for cash or hides . " This irked whites . T. Kirkman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 1897 : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The reaction of Africans to Indians was mixed . An editorial in the African newspaper Ilanga Lase Natal in 1920 argued that PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Other Africans blamed Indians for their misfortune . Heather Hughes has shown that in Inanda , African chiefs complained in 1881 that land was too expensive because the country was " full of coolies . " 102 By the 1890s , 90 percent of civil cases in Inanda involved the recovery of rent from African tenants , an indication of the extent to which they had been supplanted by Indians. 103 Colonial policy created a tripartite racial system , and assigned different rights and restrictions to Africans , Indians , and whites , notwithstanding variations of ethnicity , class , and gender . Although whites constructed the colonial order that relegated Africans to the lowest position , the anger of the latter was mostly directed against Indians during moments of crisis . As elsewhere in colonial Africa , Indians occupied an intermediate niche in the Natal economy . While they provided an important service , because they were in face-to-face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw them as directly responsible for their exploitation . <p> Rural trade carried many dangers , as illustrated by the fact that traders regularly applied for permission to own firearms . Their depositions pointed to the dangers of living isolated lives in remote parts of Natal . Mahomed Motala arrived in Natal in 1900 . After working as a hawker in Dundee for 12 years , he rented a one-room wood and iron house 18 miles outside Dannahuser . His livestock was regularly stolen and he had also lost two horses . A local African was arrested and convicted for this . Since his nearest neighbor lived over a mile away , Motala applied for a shotgun " to make an alarm to avoid any stealing . " 104 M.I. Kajee , a storekeeper of Finsbury , Polela Division , applied for a shotgun in 1916 because he had been robbed several times : " Living as I do in the heart of a large Native population , quite remote from Europeans , I am apprehensive . I am living with my wife and children , and occasionally the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time , when my family feel quite unprotected . " 105 Cassim Limbada of Chatsworth Farm applied for a firearm following an incident in 1916 : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The situation was so serious that the British Moslem League , on the motion of its president , M.A. Jeewa , passed a resolution calling on the government to protect rural traders. 107 An anonymous letter to the secretary of the interior on 20 August 1916 from " all British Indians " pointed out that " all the British Indians suffer badly by robbers and burglars . " The letter warned that unless the government gave Indian traders greater protection , " this matter will be sent forward to England and Indian Government .. We are challenging you to fight and possess what is required or you will just suffer like what we suffered and will give you good lessons twice better than what Mr. M. K. Gandhi gave you in 1913. " 108 Books of Account <p> Accounting procedures were a major bone of contention . Faruqi Maiter recalled that " books were kept in Gujarati . And someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bookkeeper could write up one year 's books in a day. 109 This irked whites . Few traders knew English . Books of account were drawn up in Urdu , Hindi , or Gujarati , mostly the latter . Storekeepers kept a cash box , and usually recorded daily transactions in a cash book , which came to be known as the " little black book . " Whites felt that Indians drew up books of account in the vernacular to conduct illegal trade . Dr. Nandy of Maritzburg , for example , complained to the colonial secretary in 1905 that the requirement that books of account be kept in English was not enforced : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> A letter to the Natal Mercury signed " P.S.A . " took exception to such accusations . On the contrary , the writer argued , the writing up of books was " skilfully organized " : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The Act of 1897 made it compulsory for accounts to be kept in " the English language in such manner as is usual and proper in the business to be carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts in English . M.A. Goga , for example , applied to the Licensing Officer of Ladysmith in 1912 to add his son Abdulla to the business . The application was refused by the licensing officer and the decision was upheld by the Licensing Board . Among the reasons given were that " A.M. Goga is a minor , is not a good English scholar , and having no knowledge of bookkeeping can not keep the necessary books of business in the English language . " Goga appealed the decision in the Supreme Court . Justice Dove Wilson ruled that Section 7 of the Dealers ' Act of 1897 " imposes no personal liability upon an applicant to keep the books " ; he only had to show that he could secure the proper keeping of such books. 113 The fact that this was an issue in a major town 15 years after the Act was passed is an indication of the abuses over the preceding years , particularly where individual lacked the means to challenge decisions in the highest courts of law . <p> Bookkeepers were in high demand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed Amod Sahib of Bombay as their bookkeeper . He was joined by his brother Ally Mia Ghazali in September 1902 . Both brothers could read and write English. 114 Amod Ismail Essack , who had a store in Connor Street , Charlestown , employed a Gujarati , Hindu V. Desai , as bookkeeper . Auditor F.A . Johnston found " the books to be correctly kept " in 1899. 115 Men with knowledge of accounting were in great demand . When Mahomed Ebrahim Patel was refused entry into South Africa in 1915 , despite being fluent in Gujarati and English , having matriculated from the Mission High School , Surat , and holding a certificate in bookkeeping from the National Union of Teacher 's Examination Board , London , M.C. Coovadia of the NIC wrote to the minister for the interior : " I may mention that the members of the Congress who are mostly merchants in this province do require men as Indian correspondents and book-keepers to make up wastage caused by natural and other causes and would certainly expect the Government in all fairness to consider few applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to in this case . " 116 A recent publication alluded to the importance of bookkeepers and respect with which they were treated. 117 In the 1911 " dialogue , " Udayshanker and Manharram , who are bookekeepers , are addressed as " master " by their employers . The Political Context : Anti-Indian Legislation <p> The success of Indian traders was dependent on the accessibility and growth potential of markets . White wholesalers welcomed Indian traders who carried their products to all parts of the Colony . Small retailers , on the other hand , saw Indians as their direct competitors and mustered their political clout to force the government to shape legislation according to their own requirements . The colonial state imposed accumulation and exchange restrictions on Indians and confined them to low-income , segregated markets . Government policy reduced competitiveness by valorising race . Indians were first targeted in Zululand where legislation between 1891 and 1893 restricted Indian trading in Melmoth , Eshowe , and Nondweni to " persons of European descent only. 118 Whites pressed for legislation in all parts of the colony as the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 102 to 152 in Durban and from 73 to 91 in Inanda between 1890 and 1893 . In Natal as a whole , there was an increase from 609 to 728 stores. 119 One councillor exclaimed that " our Indians are becoming a very serious element among us . They are about as prolific as rabbits , and almost as destructive to the welfare of Europeans . " 120 <p> Legislation was passed to curtail Indian trade after Natal achieved Responsible Government in 1893 . The Dealers Licences Act 18 of 1897 provided for the appointment of licensing officers to decide on new licenses and the transfer of licences to new premises or another party . During debate in the Legislative Council in 1897 , Prime Minister Escombe said that " we can not afford to have the competition which now exists between the Asiatic trader and the European trader .. This Bill is intended by an indirect method to get at a direct evil . " 121 To qualify for a license , applicants had to provide plans , publish applications in newspapers , give written undertakings about sanitation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The discretion of licensing officers was absolute. 122 The government 's institutionalization of trade by introducing a high degree of standardization ( particularly with regard to accounting procedures ) and onerous entry requirements closed opportunities to Indians . <p> The subjectivity of the rules was to the detriment of Indians because town councils and their licensing boards , which were dominated by white traders , were the final authority . Indians did not have the right of appeal in the courts . The Natal Advertiser considered the denial of appeal a " serious infringement of the liberty of the subject .. It makes the powers granted under the Bill dangerous . " 123 Abdul Caadir of M.C. Camroodeen and other traders saw the Act as a device used " tyrannically " to eliminate Indian competition . They petitioned Secretary of State Joseph Chamberlain on 31 December 1898 that the Durban Town Council consisted of " avowed and out-and-out opponents " of Indians . One councilor in particular " was noted for his violent speeches and has carried his hatred of Indians into the portals of the town council .. " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " under the influence of councillors " and " made it a rule not to grant a trading licence to any Indian . " 124 Between 1897 and 1909 , town councillors included prominent businessmen like George Payne of Payne Bros , J. Ellis Brown , a coffee merchant who was mayor of Durban in 1905 , Charlie Henwood of Henwoods &; Sons ; and Walter Greenacre of Harvey Greenacre &; Sons . <p> L.E . Neame observed in 1907 that " the Licencing Officer is the servant of White storekeepers . He knows their views , and whatever his personal opinion may be , he can hardly be expected to sacrifice his appointment by opposing those who employ him . " 125 Indian traders faced tremendous hardship as a result of the racist application of the law . That danger was illustrated when Ebrahim Moosajee 's application for a retail license was turned down by W.H. Acutt , licensing officer of Indwedwe , on 30 May 1900 . His appeal was heard on 11 July 1900 by a three-man Board chaired by Acutt . They upheld the refusal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he argued that the Board was not legally constituted because Acutt , as licensing officer , was prejudiced since it was his decision that was appealed against . In effect , Acutt sat in judgement on his own decision . While Judge Gallwey opined that this was " most undesirable , " and considered the practice " irregular . " he could not overturn the decision because it was legal. 126 There were many such cases throughout the Colony . <p> Indians held 844 trade licences in Natal when the Act was passed in 1897 . By March 1899 this had dropped to 683 , a decline of 19 percent in two years , while hawkers ' licences were reduced from 465 to 191 . In Durban trade licenses fell from 185 to 141 and hawkers ' licenses from 72 to 32. 127 The Durban Town Council appointed G. Molyneux as licensing officer in 1903 with the strict mandate to reduce Indian traders in the main streets of Durban . Mayor Ellis Brown , a coffee merchant , wanted Indians segregated in locations. 128 Between 1906 and 1908 , 385 Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 292 ) were not given a reason . Where reasons were given , they included things like " inability to write English , " " dishonesty , " " books not properly kept , " " undesirable applicant , " and " premises unsuitable . " 129 Molyneux used the law to effectively remove Indian traders from West and Smith Streets and achieve a racial duality. 130 In fact , Molyneux told the town clerk in 1932 that " there can be no law on the Statute Book which gives such arbitrary and uncontrolled powers as does the Act of 1897 .. Innumerable appeals have been taken . The Town Council has supported me , and in thirty years no decision of mine has been reversed by the Supreme Court . " 131 He explained in 1934 : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Despite the successful application of Act 18 of 1897 , councillors demanded harsher legislation . From 1907 applicants had to publish their requests in a newspaper , provide a thumb-impression if requested by the Licensing Officer , and pay a fee of 12 when appealing the decision. 133 The Asiatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be issued , transferred or be capable of being held by , or on behalf of , Indians " after 31 December 1908 and that no Indian could hold a license after ten years. 134 The Johannesburg Star commented that " so drastic a piece of legislation is without precedent in the history of the British Empire . " 135 The Natal Witness , in contrast , had little sympathy : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The Natal Indian Congress , Anjuman Islam Society , Hindu Sudhar Sabha , Catholic Young Men 's Society , and Indian Young Men 's Society appealed for redress to the secretary of state for the colonies in London in July 1909. 137 Natal was forced to accept one change before joining the Union of South Africa in 1910 . Act 22 of 1909 provided the right of appeal to the Supreme Court where an application for the renewal of a license was rejected . The Court had the power to order that a license be granted or to remit the case for re-hearing , but there was no reprieve regarding transfers or new applications. 138 The NIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely harsh administration " of the licensing law to the Solomon Commission of 1914 , which investigated Indian grievances . It was " unjustifiable " to refuse the transfer of a legally valid license to another individual or premises on " frivolous " grounds . There was " grave anxiety " among license holders regarding " their rights to what should be a valuable asset so long as they conform to the ordinary laws of the land . " The NIC concluded in its submission : PREFORMATTED TABLE Conclusions <p> Gujarati traders began arriving in the 1870s and were geographically dispersed throughout Natal . Traders and trade practices varied considerably . Access to exploitable family labor , suppliers , and distributors , and working long hours helped Gujarati traders outperform their white counterparts . Pioneer traders demonstrated a high degree of ethnic concentration , but many broke with the spatial logic of the ethnic enclave by spreading into rural Natal . The settlement and success of Gujarati traders depended on such ethnic factors as kinship ties , and such class factors as the availability of capital , skills , and business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional vacuum and this article takes cognizance of the wider political and economic context , and differences in opportunity structures , that resulted in Indians being constrained in relation to whites but empowered in relation to Africans . <p> The most affluent traders came with family wealth , formed partnerships , opened multiple branches , wholesale and retail stores , and warehouses , were well connected to Indian merchant houses and the Indian Ocean trade circuit , and imported goods from India , Mauritius , and England . Some even owned ships . They usually had transnational links and traveled between Natal and India , where they remained involved in social , religious , economic , and welfare activities . Wealthy traders were important in shaping Indian lives during the formative decades of settlement . As men of means , they dominated political , economic , and religious organizations and influenced the issues and agendas pursued by migrants . This rankled the whites who imposed restrictive legislation to limit , from the 1890s on , the opportunity structures that had existed when the first passengers arrived in the 1870s . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrenched white economic , political , and social superiority in Natal decades before the introduction of formal apartheid in 1948 . <p> The experience of passenger traders was mixed . Some prospered and became affluent ; others barely made a decent living ; many , in fact , became insolvent . Many passengers had humble origins . They migrated to Natal in search of a better life not only for themselves but also for the families that they left behind in their ancestral villages . They rented small wood and iron stores , relied heavily on credit provided by wholesalers , and worked long hours for modest returns . Access to the ethnic and African markets had low entry requirements . This resulted in a high level of competition among co-ethnics and the starting of businesses with little know-how or capital . The results included low profits and high failure rates . Small traders , however , played a valuable role in the Natal economy by opening new frontiers in remote corners of Natal . Theirs was a life of hard work and sacrifice . It meant giving up many comforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to person and property . They were locked in a dependency relationship with larger Indian merchants whose property they rented and from whom they obtained goods on credit in a context where it was difficult to obtain loans from white banks . <p> Individual narratives show that many migrants came as shop assistants . They migrated at a young age and were sponsored by relatives for whom they worked . Some eventually established themselves in trade , while others remained laborers . They had limited education , little knowledge of English , and worked hard to earn a basic living . Despite this , the sheer number of Indian retailers and their presence across the colony have lent themselves to the narrative of growth and success , even though the records are filled with hundreds of failed businesses and life histories show how difficult life was for many formative migrants . The success of some produced the image of the wealthy and exploitative " Indian trader , " even though the majority lived frugal lives . This image was fixed in African minds and contributed to Afro-Indian tensions from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by Muslims about Muslim traders and trade practices . In reality , business transactions were highly formal and complex , there was little trust even between Muslims ; there were numerous insolvencies and many instances of dishonesty , as well as lending and borrowing in interest-bearing transactions by Muslim traders . <p> * The author would like to thank Sephis , the Institute of International History , Amsterdam , for a grant to carry out research for this paper .
