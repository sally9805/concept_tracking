It 's amazing how much more comfortable I feel on this trip . Nothing like when my aunt and I flew to Ireland a couple of months ago and I was a total basket case . Not that I 'd exactly call myself a seasoned traveler . That would be a huge overstatement . But as I snooze and read and basically just chill on the first leg of my latest journey with Sid , flying high over the Pacific , I think maybe I 've evolved just a little . " Listen to this , Maddie , " says Sid . My aunt 's been poring over a bunch of articles that an editorial assistant downloaded onto her laptop just before we left . " Instead of protecting the public and children from violence , it is the police who are committing some of the most heinous acts of violence imaginable . " " Huh ? " I look up from a Margaret Mead book I 'm reading , one that Sid recommended called Growing Up in New Guinea . " What ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papua New Guinea . " She frowns as she removes her reading glasses . " It 's really tragic . I had no idea . " " Is that going to be the focus of your article ? " Sid and I are headed to Papua New Guinea , or PNG , which is less of a mouthful , so she can find out how the country has changed since emerging from the Stone Age into the new millennium . " I 'm not totally sure . But I 'd like to find out . " She taps her computer screen . " And listen to this quote , Maddie . ' Asa result of HIV/ AIDS , Papua New Guinea could lose up to thirty-eight percent of its working population by the year 2020 . ' " She turns and stares at me . " Can you imagine how many people that would be ? " Actually , I ca n't . Numbers have never been my strong suit . Still , I know that thirty-eight percent is a lot , and I suppose 2020 is n't that far off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Sid spews some more statistics , telling me that although PNG is somewhat remote , its number of AIDS cases is far higher than any of its neighboring countries . She also explains how inadequate the country 's health-care and medical facilities are , and I 'm starting to feel seriously concerned . In fact , I 'm beginning to wonder why I agreed to come with Sid on this trip in the first place . Okay , it 's not like I came along just for the fun of it . I mean , seeing a third-world country did sound exciting to me , but I realize we 're on something of a mission too . A mission to find Sid 's story -- whatever it might be . Her boss , John Something-or-other , has a real soft spot for this country . Sid said he 's been concerned about the changes the culture has gone through since he was last there eons ago . As a result he pulled out all the stops and sent her to uncover some big story . Sid writes for one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's not totally sure what that " big " story is going to be or if it 's even big at all . " But it 'll be an adventure , " she assured me when she invited me to join her . Now I do n't want to become overly critical of the country I 'm about to visit , but hearing these sad reports of corrupt police and what seems like a hopeless AIDS epidemic , well , it just does n't make Papua New Guinea sound terribly inviting . And it does n't sound much like Margaret Mead 's version of a rustic yet peaceful South Pacific culture . Of course , she wrote the book I 'm reading about a hundred years ago , but according to my aunt , Mead 's observations are still a good historical reference . Even so , I 'm having a hard time staying focused on her quaint little tales now . I have to wonder what caused this country to go from a bunch of happy tribal , island people to a crime-ridden country that sounds like it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed about this whole trip right now . " Oh , Maddie , " says Sid , studying my face closely . " I 'm sorry to have gone on and on about these things . " " That 's okay , " I tell her , forcing a little smile . " No . " She firmly closes her laptop and shakes her head . " I should n't have put all that on your shoulders . " " But I need to know what we 're getting into . " I sigh . " Even if it is pretty sad . I mean the facts are the facts , right ? " " But I had n't meant to talk about business just yet . " " Why not ? " " Oh , just because . " Sid gets a hard-to-read look on her face . " But I thought I came on this trip to help you , " I remind her , feeling like I 've already failed , like maybe she 's regretting her choice to bring me along , like she thinks I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be aware of what 's going on . " " True . " I feel the need to reassure her of my ability to handle this . " I 'll admit it 's kind of depressing . But it makes me curious too . I mean how does a place like New Guinea become like that ? Margaret Mead 's book makes the country sound so untouched and remote , and the people seem to have this childlike innocence . Well , for the most part anyway . They also have some pretty strange ideas about a few things . But they seem very moral and proper , especially in regard to sex . Mead even calls them puritanical . What happened ? " " Things must 've changed . " " Well , I 'd like to figure it out . I 'd like to know what made their country change . " " You 're sounding more and more like a journalist , Maddie . " I smile at her and inwardly sigh with relief . " Thanks . " " Just the same , I really did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet . " " Why not ? " I ask again , curious as to her sudden change of attitude . " I thought that 's what this trip was about . " " As I told you , Maddie , this trip is also supposed to be your birthday present . I do n't want to see you all serious and gloomy on your birthday . " I laugh . " You mean the birthday that will never be ? " I 'm well aware that we 'll be passing over the International Date Line during this trip . This will automatically kick me out of August 9 , my twentieth birthday . As a result , August 9 will be erased from my life-experience calendar forever -- the day that never was , at least for me . It 's kind of weird but kind of cool . " Hey , someday you might thank me for skipping that day , " she points out . " Instead of being fifty in thirty years , you 'll only be forty-nine . " " But I want to turn twenty ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , maybe I 'll make that missing birthday thing work for me when I 'm really old , " I say for her benefit , " but for now I 'm proclaiming myself to be twenty . Okay ? " " Not so fast , Maddie . You 're not twenty yet . " " So you mean I have to wait until we actually cross the date line ? " I glance at my watch , which is still on Pacific Daylight Time , and it says it 's 1:36 p.m . " When will that be anyway ? The middle of the night ? " She just laughs and reopens her laptop , but she also has this slightly mysterious expression on her face . Like maybe she 's got a surprise up her sleeve . Perhaps a mini-birthday cake hidden back there with the flight attendants . Hopefully chocolate . Anyway , I ca n't be too bummed about the skipped date since my family and friends already celebrated my " unbirthday " before I left . My best friend , Katie , who is thankfully no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me just yesterday . Of course , they all gave me a bad time about having my birthday " erased " by the International Date Line , teasing me that I 'd still be nineteen when I came back . After a while , I almost started to wonder . Consequently , I did a little research of my own last night . I was curious as to why the world even needs an International Date Line in the first place . But it seems that if a traveler went west all the way around the world , journaling the days or marking them off the calendar , that person would end up with one extra day by the time he got home . Now that seems a little crazy , but it 's true . It has to do with clocks and time-zone changes and the globe spinning , and to be perfectly honest , it sort of messes with my mind a little . Some of the passengers on this flight are pretty stoked because their final destination is Honolulu , Hawaii . The rest of us will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia . We 're only stopping there so the plane can be refueled for the second leg of our journey . I already told Sid that I 'd love to get off the plane just so I could brag to my friends that I 'd been in Honolulu , even if only for a few minutes , but she said that would probably be impossible , due to security . Even so , I think I can still say I was in Honolulu , even if my feet never actually touched the ground . At least I 've got a window seat on the left side of the plane , which , according to the flight attendant , should help me get a quick peek at Pearl Harbor right before we land and maybe even Diamond Head after we take off again . Then we 'll fly all night and reach Sydney the morning of August 10 . And August 9 will be permanently erased from my calendar . So weird . After a while Margaret Mead puts me to sleep . When I wake up , I can hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I push up the vinyl window shade and look out in time to see amazingly blue water and some green and brown islands below . " It 's so beautiful down there , " I say longingly to Sid . " Uh-huh . " Her nose is still in her computer . " The water is all these shades of blue , " I tell her . " Sapphire , turquoise , aquamarine ... and it 's so clear I 'm sure I can see the bottom of the ocean . " " Uh-huh , " she mutters again . Whatever she 's reading must be really interesting -- probably depressing too . I want to ask a flight attendant to point out Pearl Harbor , but they 're already getting buckled into their jump seats , preparing for the landing . So I just look and try to figure things out for myself . Too bad I did n't think ahead to get a travel brochure or something . Well , if nothing else , I can say that what little I saw of Hawaii was really , truly beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 1:48 p.m. when we touch down in Honolulu -- Hawaii time , that is , which I understand is two hours earlier than Pacific Daylight Time . Still , I do n't readjust my watch yet . Why bother ? I observe some of the other passengers standing up and cramming themselves into the narrow aisles as they pry pieces of luggage out of the overhead compartments . It 's actually kind of funny . Like , what 's the hurry ? The doors are n't even open yet . But they eagerly stand there with their bags and purses and briefcases and things , just waiting . It reminds me of our cows back home when it 's close to feeding time . They 'll simply line up and wait and wait . Sometimes they 'll wait a couple of hours . Finally the passengers begin slowly moving toward the exit . They still remind me of cows as they amble along . It 's all I can do to keep from mooing as they go past . Or maybe it 's just Hawaii envy . I really should grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she closes her laptop and slips it into her briefcase . " Ready for what ? " " To get off the plane . " " Really ? " I say hopefully . " We can get off ? " " Yes , " she says . " Did n't you hear the flight attendant say that we can get off here if we want while they clean up for the next flight ? " " No . " I look around and notice that a lot of passengers are remaining in their seats . But maybe they 've set foot in Honolulu before . " I guess you were asleep , " she says as we stand up . " The layover is at least two hours . " She stands and reaches for her carry-on . " Oh yeah , if we get off , we 're supposed to remove our carry-on items too . It 's a security thing . " So we both get our carry-on pieces and exit the plane . I have to admit it feels so great to stretch my legs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really been in Honolulu , even if it 's only the airport . Katie will be impressed . " Hey , do you think I have time to find some postcards ? " I ask . " Or do we have to stick around here , close to the plane ? " " I think you have time , " she says . " Let 's walk this way . " So we walk for what seems quite a ways through the terminal , going past lots of gates , and the next thing I know we 've gone right past the security check too . " Aunt Sid , " I say , " we 've gone too far ! Now we 'll have to go back through security . " She laughs . " Not today , we wo n't . " " Huh ? " " Happy birthday , Maddie ! " She unzips her carry-on and pulls out a slightly rumpled paper lei , then puts it around my neck and gives me a big hug . " Aloha , sweetie , and welcome to Honolulu ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honolulu , Maddie . " " What about Papua New Guinea ? " I ask with concern . And , okay , this seems pretty weird , because I was beginning to dread going to our final destination , but now I 'm suddenly worried that this is it -- that we 're not going any farther than Honolulu ! As much as I want to see Hawaii , I do n't want to miss going to New Guinea . " Oh , do n't worry , " she tells me . " This is just a little layover . A birthday surprise for you . I did n't really want you to miss your birthday as we flew over the International Date Line . " " Really ? " She nods . " Yes . We have two days to do whatever we please in Honolulu . And then it 's back on the plane and off to the other side of the planet . " She smiles at me . " So you really do want to go to Papua New Guinea after all ? " " Of course ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limousine , which takes us to a very cool hotel right along Waikiki . " Swanky , " I say as we go into a very luxurious room that overlooks the beach . " Swankier than the inn in Clifden ? " she teases . I mentally compare this place to our ocean-view digs in Ireland . " You know , they 're both swanky in their own way . " She nods . " I 'm glad you can appreciate a variety of cultures . " " I 'm learning . " She tosses her bags onto one of the queen-size beds and stretches her arms . " Ah , this is just the kind of break I need right now . " " Man , am I glad you told me to pack a swimsuit , " I tell her as I look out the window to see tall palm trees and white sand and miles and miles of varying shades of bright aqua blue water . " Ready to hit the beach ? " she says . " Woo-hoo ! " We change and gather our beach stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I splash around in the energetic waves , which are surprisingly warm and nothing like the chilly Pacific in Washington State . I even let a couple of friendly guys give me some tips on body surfing , which is way harder than it looks . And finally , feeling totally relaxed and happy , I flop onto a towel next to my aunt and soak up the last rays of afternoon sun . I could so get used to this !
