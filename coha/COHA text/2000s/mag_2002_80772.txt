It 's on the ' House In leading resurgent Detroit , Jerry Stackhouse has learned the joys of passing // When Pistons shooting guard Jerry Stackhouse talks about the recent changes in his life , he sounds as if he has found religion . The truth is that he 's learned how to pass and how to lead . // Last Thursday at New Jersey , Detroit was trailing 78-77 with two minutes remaining when backup point guard Damon Jones dished to Stackhouse . Instead of forcing a three-pointer over 6 ' 7 " Richard Jefferson , Stackhouse zipped the ball back to Jones , whose wide-open three from the corner gave the Pistons a lead they would n't relinquish in an 85-80 victory . " Last year I probably would have taken that shot , " says Stackhouse . " I did n't used to feel this way , but I care as much about making an assist now as scoring a bucket . " // Stackhouse is content with his scoring average of 23.0 points-down 6.8 points from last season  --  because at week 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000-01 pace . Detroit had also won six straight on the road , its best streak in 12 seasons . At the heart of the team 's success is the 6 ' 6 " Stackhouse , who was leading the Pistons with 5.2 assists per game , the third-best average among NBA shooting guards . " His all-around game has risen to an amazingly high level , " says 76ers coach Larry Brown , who dealt Stackhouse to Detroit four seasons ago . // Much of the credit for Stack-house 's ascent goes to rookie coach Rick Carlisle , who had developed a reputation for aloofness as an assistant with the Pacers . After Indiana passed over him and hired Isiah Thomas last season , Carlisle became a part-time broadcaster in Seattle and a full-time student of coaching , learning the importance of having close relationships with the players , especially with the stars . " I told Rick that Jerry is not unreasonable and not uncoachable , " says Detroit CM . Joe Dumars , who played 1 ? seasons with Stackhouse . " He was a good person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the day after Dumars hired Carlisle , the new coach spent more than two hours conveying to Stackhouse his vision of a ball-sharing team . " It was like an oral exam , the way Rick was picking my brain , " recalls Stackhouse , 27 . " My first reaction was , How many teams really use everybody ! " // Playing Carlisle 's way , the Pistons  --  who were picked by SI to finish 14th in the East  --  got off to a 14-6 start . When they dropped 12 of their next 14 , however , Stackhouse 's many critics were sure he would revert to his old shoot-first form . Instead he continued to spread the wealth and at week 's end had taken the Pistons on a 12-4 run that placed them a game behind the Bucks for the best record in the Central Division . " Once the pressure was on , he responded extremely well , " says Heat coach Pat Riley . " He 's making plays , he 's unselfish , he 's a better defender , he 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slash and score . " // Despite his improved all-around play , Stackhouse , a two-time Ail-Star in his more selfish days , was n't chosen for this year 's squad . " That 's a bad message to send , " says Trail Blazers guard Steve Kerr , who rates Stackhouse with Vince Carter and Michael Finley among wing players , a cut below Kobe Bryant , Michael Jordan and Tracy McGrady. // Stackhouse hopes to make the league pay by advancing in the playoffs for the first time in his career . The grinding , defensive-minded Pistons stand out in the underachieving East , where the Bucks , Raptors and Sixers have more talent but show less passion . Stackhouse 's 35.8 minutes per game are 4.4 fewer than last season , which allows him to burn more energy at the defensive end . Despite a groin injury he suffered in November , Stackhouse says , " For the first time I feel like I 'm getting stronger each month . " // Carlisle calls the majority of the plays in order to dictate tempo and make sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who says he limits his freelancing to " like , one play each half , " then gets more freedom from Carlisle to take control over the final three minutes when the game is close . " I 've bought into numbers , " he says . " Rick has statistics showing that when we move the ball from side to side , our scoring percentages are off the charts . " // Stackhouse 's early career was marked by his failure to complement Allen Iverson on the court in Philadelphia and his wars with Grant Hill off it in Detroit " Everything was tailored to Grant , " Stackhouse says , " to the point that guys on the team would n't speak their minds . " However , now that he has learned to sacrifice for his team 's success , Stackhouse sounds as if he would like to turn back the clock . " It would be great to have somebody like Grant back on our roster , " he says . " I could take having a real star on the team and still feel secure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignite us , and when I do n't have it , we do n't have it . " // Stern 's European Invasion FIBA Not Thrilled About NBA 's Plan // The revelation during All-Star weekend that the NBA is considering expansion into Europe signaled a reversal for commissioner David Stern , who had spent the previous decade promising basketball officials overseas that he would not encroach on their turf . Stern made it clear that the league needs new revenue streams , and he 'll begin by seeking them in Europe , then try to crack the potentially lucrative market in China . // " The domestic market for men 's basketball is getting to be mature , " Stern told SI last Thursday . " Television ratings are not going to go up . Advertising is not going to experience any robust growth in the near future . " // Stern pointed to last week 's decision by Fox to write down $909 million in losses on its contracts with the NFL , NASCAR and baseball as the latest sign that the American sports market is saturated . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices in 10 countries , European leagues made vulnerable by infighting , and the worldwide popularity of basketball at an alltime high . " We have enormous growth potential , " Stern says , " and it 's outside the United States . " // FIBA secretary-general Borislav Stankovic  --  the David Stern of international basketball  --  does n't sound ready to cede Europe to the NBA " Our relationships with the NBA have been good , " Stankovic says , " until now . " // Stern will decide within the next year on a course of expansion , then implement that plan when the league 's new $4.6 billion television contract expires in 2007-08 . The options : 1 ) taking over an existing European league , such as the 32-team Euro-League ; 2 ) establishing a new league , separate from the NBA , and placing franchises in the continent 's major cities ; 3 ) inviting several European clubs to join the NBA , a scenario long endorsed by many of the leading teams there ; and 4 ) placing NBA expansion franchises in Europe , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players would happily move overseas  --  many object to playing in Canada  --  the last two proposals seem farfetched . Stern insists , though , that they 're plausible . If he 's right , that could force FIBA to play ball and accept one of the first two options . // The NBA would seek to build European basketball in an American way , which means bringing together corporate investors and media moguls ( like Rupert Murdoch or Italy 's Silvio Berlusconi ) to finance the major league basketball arenas that do n't exist in Europe . Stern envisions entertainment hubs in which modern soccer and basketball facilities stand side by side with a shopping mall in between . // As Stern sees it , European basketball is in the midst of a crisis and needs the NBA 's leadership to dig its way out . A two-year-old spat between FIBA and ULEB , a breakaway faction representing many of the top clubs , has turned into Europe 's version of the old NBA-ABA war and is dividing the fan base . " In the post-Dream Team period basketball in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose good relationship with FIBA led to the introduction of NBA players to the Olympics in 1992 . " But that ascent has stopped . " // " I do n't agree , " says Stankovic , pointing to the number of Europeans in the NBA and the fact that the U.S. was almost beaten by Lithuania in the 2000 Olympics . He also makes a solid point when he warns that the NBA 's superstar culture may not fly in the Old World , where fans are passionate about their clubs . " Stern 's idea is to present sport as entertainment , but it 's very , very difficult to say if that will be successful , " Stankovic says . " In Europe the spectators only care about seeing victory for their team and not the spectacle . " // Swingman Shandon Anderson Money Aside , Nix With the Knicks // For a perfect example of how hard it can sometimes be for a player to fit into a system , consider Knicks swingman Shandon Anderson , who at week 's end was averaging a career-low 4.8 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team that is likely to miss the playoffs for the first time in 15 seasons . // New York acquired Anderson , 28 , from the Rockets in a three-way trade involving Glen Rice last summer and will pay him $42 million over six years , making him the team 's third-most-expensive player . There seemed little chance that Anderson would make a difference commensurate with that salary , especially when he would have to share time with the Knicks ' top two scorers , Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell . A role player , Anderson focuses on making subtler contributions . " Make the game easy  --  get easy baskets , get out in the open court , move the ball around , " he says . " I learned that in Utah . " // Chosen with the 54th draft pick in 1996 by Scott Layden , who was me Jazz G.M. at the time and now holds that position with the Knicks , Anderson played in the NBA Finals in his first two years . He admits he was too young to realize how good he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , ' Do n't think the grass is always greener on the other side , ' but I did n't understand , " Anderson says . " I 'd played there three years , I was accustomed to one system , and I thought that was the way things would be . I did n't realize there are 28 other teams who play about 20 different systems . " // Does Anderson regret leaving the Jazz to sign a two-year , $4.2 million deal with Houston before coming to New York ? " I felt they 'd groomed me in Utah , and I needed to go off into the world and see what I could do , " says Anderson . " But I got used to playing in the playoffs there . " // Play of the Week Double-Blind // After a half season loaded with bad luck , the Heat got a huge break last Friday from referee Bill Spooner , who from eight feet away failed to notice an obvious violation by Miami guard Eddie Jones in the closing seconds of a game at Milwaukee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dribble under pressure from Anthony Mason outside the three-point arc , then dribbled again to free himself for a shot Although Jones missed badly , teammate Jimmy Jackson grabbed the rebound , raced behind the arc and drilled a buzzer-beating three to send the game into overtime . Jones then hit the decisive shot in Miami 's 90-88 win , nailing a 10-footer with 7.1 seconds left in OT . // " That was a high school call by a high school ref , " said Bucks coach George Karl . Said Heat coach Pat Riley , " I ai n't giving it back . "
