. Want to fill your tag on opening day ? Here 's how to make all the right calls With all the demands on our time , it 's easy to let the opening day of turkey season catch us unprepared . But do n't let the first days , potentially the best for catching unwary birds , slip by while you perfect your calls . Just as athletes prepare for their first game months before the opening whistle is blown , a turkey hunter needs to practice if he hopes to make that first call of the season irresistible to a gobbler . GET STARTED NOW For two-time Grand National calling champ Chris Kirby , practice has no beginning and no end . " Practice can never be over . It should be something a guy does all year long if he wants to make every call in the field with confidence , " says Kirby , who is also president of Quaker Boy Game Calls . If you 're not going to work with your calls year-round , at least begin practicing several times a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opener , practice at least 30 minutes each day . But first , dig out all your old calls and give them a close inspection . Toss any calls that are cracked or chipped or have worn and wrinkled reeds . " This is a good time to buy three or four types of calls so you 're not limited to one particular sound , " Kirby says . " If you go out there during the season able to make only one sound and a turkey does n't gobble to it , you 're stuck . " At the most basic level , a turkey hunter should be well versed in working a box call , a slate ( or pot and peg ) and a mouth diaphragm . Other options include the easy-to-use pushpin or , for more advanced users , tube calls and wingbones . RUN A BOX " I think a box call sounds most like a real turkey . If you 're inexperienced , work first with a box call , " says turkey hunting veteran Ray Eye . First make sure the lid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then chalk the box along the full length of the lid . Hold the call by the bottom , not the sides , as this deadens the tone . Also , never touch the sound-producing surfaces with your fingers . Skin oils can damage the call . Whether you hold the lid handle toward you or aimed up does n't matter . In fact , try it several ways to see which works best for you . To tune the call , adjust the screw holding the lid , one turn at a time . You want it to make a clear , raspy yelp . Never lift the lid from the box while calling , but try applying different levels of pressure to produce varied tones . WORK A SLATE Pot and peg calls , or slates ( as they are commonly referred to regardless of what the calling surface is made of ) , produce excellent cutts and purrs . By combining pots that have different surfaces with pegs of varying materials , you can create a broad range of tones and pitches . Keep the calling surface clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioning stone or light-grit sandpaper . Hold the striker like a pencil in the hand you write with , with the top angled away from your body . To produce a yelp , work the striker in small circles , keeping it in contact with the slate the entire time it is moving . GET MOUTHY While more challenging to learn than a box or slate , a mouth call allows a hunter to make the entire repertoire of turkey sounds and keep his movement to a minimum . It also works well in any weather and is relatively inexpensive . The average diaphragm can be bought for around $5 . Do n't waste time with single-reed calls . They lack rasp . Try a multi-reed call . For maximum raspiness , go with a call that has three or four layers of latex and a cut in one of the layers . The call should fit snugly against the roof of the mouth to create an airtight seal . Though some hunters bend their calls or trim the tape from around them for a better fit , Kirby says most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you trim the tape , do so a little at a time . " Once you have the call in your mouth , move it around as you 're calling to get the full range of sounds the call can make , " Kirby says . Author Affiliation <p>                     @x There were seven of us at Edgewater that summer , if you count my brother Jeebs . None of us did , really . Jeebs was thirteen and gone into another orbit of his own ; he entered ours only when he had nothing else to do , and then grudgingly . <p> That left Harriet Randall , aged eleven ; Ben and Carolyn Forrest , who were twins , aged ten ; Cecie Wentworth , aged eleven ; Peter Cornish , aged twelve ; and Joby Gardiner , eleven . And of course , me . Elizabeth Allen Constable but called , by my own creed , Lilly and nothing else . I was eleven that summer of 1962 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was Elizabeth , too . <p> My mother : Elizabeth Potter Constable ; painter , activist ( in her own words ) , great beauty . She was sporadic and only adequate at the first two , but at the third she was spectacularly successful . Turned heads followed Liz Constable wherever she went . <p> It was the apogee of the frenzied Jackie Kennedy mythology , and even up here in this rural saltmeadow world almost untouched by fashion for a century , women wore their hair in carefully tousled bouffants and put on crisp white sleeveless blouses and Bermuda shorts to go to the post office or general store ( which were one and the same ) . The yacht club cocktail-and-chowder suppers looked like a Norman Rockwell magazine cover of an idyllic girls ' camp . Into the middle of all the matched Lilly Pulitzer wrap skirts and T-shirts , the huge sunglasses pushed casually above foreheads to form chic headbands , my mother would drift barefoot like an idle racing sloop , her hair in its uncombed little Greek-boy tousle of curls , her white pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had affected since a trip to Cannes when she was sixteen daubed with it . There would not be a vestige of makeup on her pure medieval features , only a flush of sunburn on her high cheekbones and a slick of Chap Stick on her full , tender mouth-a Piero della Francesca mouth , according to Brooks Burns , two cottages down , who was a classical scholar and eighty years old , and had been in love with my mother , according to my father , since she came here as a bride . <p> " Eyes like summer rain on the ocean , " he would say . " Eyes like clear pond ice . " <p> " Eyes like a frozen February crust over Eggemoggin Reach , " I might have added , " especially when those black brows come together over them . " <p> But I doubted that anyone but my father and Jeebs and I had seen that . My mother 's brows were two silky black slashes set straight over her eyes , which were clear , light-spilling gray and fringed with black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you expected slender sienna arches . I had those brows , I was often told , and the gray eyes , too , but even to me they often looked stormy and sulky instead of mythic . I had seen my mother , in her studio just before she came out to join us for an evening , slick her eyebrows with some sort of cream , and lightly redden her cheeks , and finger-tousle her hair before the old seashell mirror that hung beside the studio door . Once or twice I saw her daub a sunset smear on her cheek or forehead , or stain her shirt lightly with it . The result was a careless beauty seemingly preoccupied with things more important than her looks . It served her well . <p> I spied on my mother shamelessly during the summer . I 'm still not quite sure why . I think I was looking for revelations , epiphanies , a map for knowing where the real woman and mother lay . It seemed that if I found it , I would have the map for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did , and after that summer I did not spy on her again . Instead , I set about trying to become the direct antithesis of the woman in her mirror . It got me in endless trouble with her , though not so much with my father . <p> " Let her be , " he would tell her from the rocking chair on the porch that was his regular summertime emplacement . " You would n't want a perfect little copy of you , would you ? I would think one is enough . " <p> " She could do worse , " I heard my mother say once , tightly , in the days when I still eavesdropped . " Not much , " I thought my father murmured from the rocker , but I was never sure of that . <p> And yet she was not all artifice . All the children from the cottages around us flocked to ours as naturally as thirsty birds to a birdbath . All the cottages down on this particular cove were members of the Middle Harbor Yacht Club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had full privilege to join the brown , scabby-kneed colony children on the dock and in the tenders and small Beetle Cats in the harbor , or playing Ping-Pong in the raffish old clubhouse , or camping out on the islands in the bay across the harbor . And sometimes we did , but summer friendships are cemented early and tightly , and we came to be regarded as privileged outlanders , " too good for us , " hanging around only with each other at Liz Constable 's cottage . My mother really loved children , or , perhaps , I thought that summer , the children of others , and never seemed annoyed or bored with our endless and obscure yelping games , or the little flotilla of kayaks and Shellback dinghies that were tied up all summer beside my family 's old Friendship sloop at the end of our dock . We were the only cottage in our settlement that had a deepwater dock . All the others kept their boats at the yacht club . <p> Mother vanished for long periods during the day , into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters or phoning on behalf of her causes . They were good New England liberal causes , my father often said : birth-control information for young girls , Martin Luther King , Jr. , and his incendiary young civil rights battle , meals for the infirm and disenfranchised of Hancock County , cleaning up the effluent-fouled streams and bays nearby . <p> I know she was serious about these causes . I had seen her in tears over some social injustice or other featured on the flickery old black-and-white television in the cottage living room . And I know that there were people in the colony , women mainly , who found her indiscreet and vaguely threatening and her causes as unseemly in our little nineteenth-century fiefdom as a fart at the Chowder Race . I know too that she honestly did not care a finger flick what people thought of her activism or her painting . But she did care , secretly and profoundly , about maintaining her role as a careless natural beauty , a warm , funny woman far above artifice and agendas . I could never fathom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely beyond children . <p> But I still ca n't today . <p> At noon Clara Anderson , who " did " for us mornings and who was the third generation of her family to do so for mine , would make a tray of bologna and cheese sandwiches and lemonade and put it on the big side screened porch , and we would rush in and wolf them down and be off again in a chattering swarm , out to the water or to the badminton and croquet courts my grandfather had carved out of the woods behind the cottage . <p> The other cottage mothers in our cove knew where to call if they had need of their children . So far as I knew , none of them ever worried that their offspring might be a bother to my mother , or that they might be in any way unsafe . Of course it was Clara who had the day-to-day burden of us , but she too liked children and had three of her own , and in our defense we had not yet absorbed any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol , promiscuity , revolution . In Carter 's Cove , as our little settlement was called , all that came much later . The only really malicious thing I can remember us doing was setting off cherry bombs in the shabby small bathroom of the yacht club 's steward , a tight-faced fireplug-shaped young man from one of the original colony families who had not been accepted at Yale and was coldly mean-spirited to our crowd because we were not " his " kids . When our parents found out about it , we were forced to pick blueberries and wash windows and mow lawns to earn enough money for a new and vastly superior toilet . It struck us as only fair , and so we did not grouse too much about it , except that the steward got a far better toilet out of the deal and smirked at us all summer . <p> " Why were you so down on your mother that summer ? " Cam asked me once . We had been together two months and were still in the stage where the necessity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was paramount . On weekends , over coffee in one of the many small , dark cafTs ; at dinners of pizzas and cheeseburgers and an occasional salad ; at night in the carapace of his old Porsche Carrera between kisses so profoundly consuming that they left us both sweating and gasping , we talked and we talked and we talked . Everything we said to each other was miraculous : the fact that he had been in the National Spelling Bee and lost by misspelling " mackerel " ( I do n't eat it to this day ) . The fact that I had once dyed my hair green with food coloring before the Cornwell Country Day production of Peter Pan . ( " Were you Wendy ? " " No , I was the dog , Nana . A green sheepdog . I was a great hit . " ) <p> So when he asked me about my mother and my feelings toward her that summer , I did not hesitate to spill out to him the thing I had never told anyone . Not my various best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . No one . <p> " One day early that summer I went running up to her studio to ask her something , " I said . " I forget what . Whether we could go somewhere or other , I think . The stairs and the third-floor hall were covered in sisal matting , and I was barefoot and was sure she could n't hear me . It was lunchtime . We were never around her at lunchtime . <p> " Anyway , I got to the door of her studio and it was closed , but it always was , so in my adopted mode as supersleuth I eased the door open and looked in . She was ... she was standing in front of her easel , facing me , and she had her shirt unbuttoned to the waist and was holding it open , and old Brooks Burns was standing in front of her with his hands all over her breasts , crawling like old spiders . Every now and then he 'd bend over and smack one of them , or suck at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat ; I thought maybe he was dying . She was smiling at him . It was ... a sweet smile . Tender , like she 'd give a child . After a while she said something to him and kissed him on the cheek , still smiling , and buttoned up her blouse and turned back to her easel and picked up her brush . He stood there awhile , gasping like a gaffed fish , and started to turn and leave . I was out of there and down the steps before I could get a deep breath . Then I went into the bathroom and threw up , and stayed in my bed under the covers all that day . I could n't let anyone in , not Clara , not my father , not my summer best friend , Cecie Wentworth . <p> " After dinner , my mother came in with a tray of toast and milk and started to sit down beside me and-I do n't know-feel my forehead or feed me or something . I said , ' No , ' and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her set the tray down and go out of my room and shut the door . " <p> Cam was silent for a while , tracing the line of my jaw with his fingertip . Then he said , " You never cut her much slack , did you ? " <p> " Slack ? My God ! That old ... satyr ! You should have seen it . " <p> " Did it ever occur to you that she might have been doing him an exceedingly kind thing ? " <p> " Not once , " I said , knowing the truth of what he said . Tears burned in my eyes . " Never once . " <p> The memory of that day stuck like a burr in my brain . I tried to dislodge it ; I was not prepared to give up my grand and secret anomie . But I could feel it begin to trickle away like sand out of a sieve . <p> " Well , " Cam said , " I know if I was old and you showed me your beautiful boobs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's different . " <p> " Why is it ? " <p> I did not answer , and presently he said , " Was she like that ? I mean when you were back home , in school and all that ? " <p> I remember that I stared at him for a long moment . It was something that had never occurred to me . " No , " I said slowly , thinking back to the winters in Washington that followed those summers . " No , she was n't . She was different at Edgewater . Come to think of it , we all were . " <p> " Why do you think that was ? " <p> " It was just ... simpler there . Nothing changed . In our colony , in all those old colonies , not much had changed since the first people came there . Nothing much was new . If somebody painted a veranda or built a porch or bought a new piece of furniture , no matter how broken-down the old one was , people talked about it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit . We ate the same things at the same time that our parents and grandparents had , or so my father said , and the grown-ups went to the same porches for cocktails and the club had the same regattas with the same boats every year , and it seemed to me that we even wore the same things every summer that I could remember , things we 'd left at Edgewater . And we played the same games , children 's games that we would n't have been caught dead playing at home . It was like all of us slipped back into some kind of idyllic summer time warp ; it was like time stopped . I wonder why I never thought about that before . It was a whole other life and nobody seemed to know or question it . " <p> " So what do you think was responsible for all that ? It sounds like Brigadoon . " <p> " The ocean , " I said suddenly , as sure of that as I had ever been of anything in my life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You sound like a sea nymph or a kelpie . Could n't it have been that you were all the same people you were all year , and the place , and the water , and all the old associates just called out different parts of you ? Parts that just were n't ... winter parts ? People do n't have two different selves , Lil . There are countless sides to all of us . " <p> " No . We were different people there . I 'm sure of that . " <p> I was obscurely annoyed at him . He was undoubtedly right ; Cam was always , among a thousand other things , my voice of pure reason . But I knew what I knew . I was different at Edgewater ; I had always been different there . Back in Washington I was very much a child of my time ; that sweet , smug , late fifties and early sixties world shaped me like potter 's clay . I was touched by most of it . But in those Maine summers I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a much simpler being , awkwardly pure and without artifice except for that last summer , when I became a spy , and there was something essentially artless even about that . Cam was wrong . The sea changed me . <p> I remember that I began to feel the sea recede as soon as we pulled out of the gravel driveway at Edgewater . By the time we crossed the Piscataqua River into New Hampshire , the breath of the bay was as faint as that of a dying child . By the time we reached Washington , D.C. , it was gone , though its cadence whispered to me for months , a ghost without enough strength to do a proper haunting . In the first few humid , swaddling days before my classes at the National Cathedral School for Girls began , I was like a timid , newly caged wild thing : scarcely remembering but feeling in every cell the world I had lost , sniffing and tasting the somehow familiar cage into which I had been put , creature of neither , creature of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible in those few days ; a changeling . My father simply touched my tangled curls and said , " It 's not easy when you first come back , is it ? But in a few days you 'll be right at home at Cathedral , and then before you know it it 'll be time to go back to Maine again . " <p> I was nine or ten when I realized that it must be hard for him , too , newly returned to the most urban fortress of George Washington University , where he taught Chaucer , Shakespeare , and the Lake Poets to juniors and seniors who had not had the grades or the wherewithal to attend one of the Ivies . George Washington has a lustrous academic name now , but it was not always so . I am certain that my father never minded that . He was essentially a content man , perhaps a happy one . He was easy in his skin and confident in his calling , and a born family man . I have seen him angry , but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His blue eyes often narrowed at injustice , unfairness , cruelty . But I have also seen them fill with tears as he looked at us around the dinner table or together in the sun at Edgewater . I think he was a very good man . I wish I had inherited more of that , instead of his wide mouth and light , straight stature . ( Continues ... ) <p>
