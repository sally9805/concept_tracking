<p> &lt;&gt;Special report : The legacy of tougher prisons&lt;&gt; <p> HUNTSVILLE , Texas  --  His last evening in solitary confinement , Angel Coronado forced himself to go to sleep before dusk . After nearly two years of maddening isolation in a tiny , windowless state prison cell , he hoped that would make the hours leading to his release pass quickly . <p> The next morning , after a pancake breakfast  --  as always , shoved into his cell at 3:30 a.m.  --  Coronado , 20 , received a set of prison-made clothes , a one-way bus ticket back home to South Texas and a check for $ 100 . And then Coronado , who would pace for hours in his 6- by 10-foot cell to fight off frustration and loneliness , was free  --  and overwhelmed . <p> " It 's hard to say how good this feels , " he said , his teeth chattering in the cold wind last month after he walked out of prison and took in a sight from the past : the sky . " There are no cages to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his few belongings in an old onion sack , Texas prison officials seemed to be planning for his return . They told police in Donna , Texas , Coronado 's hometown near the Mexican border , that the gang member who was sent to prison here on an assault conviction was headed their way . <p> The call was similar to thousands of warnings to local police this year about felons like Coronado , who after spending years in extreme isolation are returning to America 's streets with little or no rehabilitation  --  and what analysts suspect are slim hopes of avoiding a return to crime . Of the record 630,000 felons projected to be released this year from state prisons , the thousands who were kept in solitary confinement for much or all of their sentences could pose the most danger , authorities say . <p> Many are killers , rapists , drug dealers and others who have been in " super maximum " - security prisons , which are the showpieces of the prison building boom of the 1990s . The scores of new " super max " prisons across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sentences tougher and seemed to abandon any pretense of trying to rehabilitate inmates . <p> As was the case with Coronado at the Coffield prison in Tennessee Colony , Texas , inmates at super max prisons typically are kept in small cells for 23 hours a day . They have no one to talk with , little or no television , no windows , restricted visitation with family members and little help in dealing with what analysts call the physical and psychological atrophy that can result from such conditions . <p> Now , in record numbers , those convicts and other felons are getting out . It 's an ongoing exodus that some law enforcement officials believe is at least partly to blame for last year 's 2.1% increase in major crimes nationwide , the first such rise in more than a decade . <p> It 's unclear how many inmates are being released directly from isolation cells into communities ; states do not keep uniform statistics on such inmates . But Texas , which has more than 9,000 inmates in isolation , the most in the nation , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , Florida has set free nearly 1,000 inmates who were in isolation . <p> Prison officials say some released from super max prisons this year had been in isolation for a decade . Others , like Coronado , are gang members who wound up in isolation for shorter periods after breaking prison rules or getting into fights with other inmates . <p> States are just beginning to examine the threat that such convicts pose after their release . But law enforcement and prison officials agree that the percentage of formerly isolated inmates who are likely to be arrested within three years of their release easily surpasses the 62% recidivism rate for all felons that has been reported by the Justice Department . <p> " This class of prisoner represents the highest possible risk , " says former Texas District Court judge Fernando Mancias , who sent Coronado to the general prison population three years ago , before Coronado 's discipline problems landed the inmate in isolation . " We 've been destroying these people , denying them access to rehabilitation and releasing them to communities resentful and angry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says he hopes that Coronado will turn his life around . But Mancias , who opposes the broad use of solitary confinement , says that most inmates like Coronado are " doomed to failure . " <p> Construction of super max prisons has fueled a jump in the number of inmates held in isolation nationwide . A recent survey of 34 states and the District of Columbia by the Criminal Justice Institute , a national research firm in Connecticut , found that the percentage of isolated prisoners in those jurisdictions rose from an average of 4.5% in 1994 to 6.5% last year . <p> Prison officials say the increasing use of isolation cells has made their facilities safer and more manageable  --  and broken the hold that gangs had on some prisons . But mental health specialists say the lack of attention to how isolation can affect inmates long after their release has put the public at increased risk . <p> The Justice Department has moved to reduce that risk . This year , it allocated more than $ 150 million to states to help violent offenders before release with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some states , inmates in isolation are denied access to rehabilitation programs for security reasons . <p> " The prison system has forgotten that one of its missions is to increase the safety of the public when these people are released , " says Stuart Grassian , a Harvard University psychiatrist who has studied the long-term effects of solitary confinement . <p> " When everybody was talking about getting tough on crime , all we really did was get tough on ourselves . Our system has succeeded in making prisoners as agitated and violent as humanly possible , " Grassian says . " What people forget is that 95% of these ( inmates ) get out at some point . These people have no clue about how to get along in a real-life setting . The only thing you can do is pray they do n't pick you as their next victim . " <p> ' Thanks for going Greyhound ' <p> Except for the exaggerated swagger of a prison gangster , there is nothing scary looking about Angel Coronado . <p> Of the 25 just-released inmates boarding the southbound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unassuming  --  looks the least like a hardened criminal . But he has been in trouble nearly half his life . <p> He says he began snorting cocaine when he was 12 . A juvenile rap sheet followed , highlighted by incidents of criminal mischief , two burglaries and an escape from a youth home in South Texas . <p> He fell in with a gang as a teenager , and , barely a month out of treatment for cocaine abuse in June 1999 , he was the triggerman in a shooting in Donna , a town of nearly 15,000 on the southern tip of Texas . Coronado was sentenced to six years ' probation , avoiding prison largely because no one was hit by the shotgun blasts he fired while in a cocaine-induced haze . <p> " I do n't remember their names , " he says , recounting the incident and his intended targets . " I wanted to hurt them , yeah . Kill them ? I do n't think so . " <p> Less than four months later , his probation was revoked when he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Coronado was sent into the state prison system . <p> Like his older brother , Daniel " Danny Boy " Coronado , 21 , a convicted burglar who now is in solitary confinement for assaulting a prison guard , Angel Coronado spent time in several prisons before being moved into isolation . <p> In 2000 , about a year into his three-year sentence , Coronado was first put into isolation  --  Texas calls it " administrative segregation "  --  when guards found two shanks he had fashioned from coils in a hot plate . Coronado briefly was returned to the general prison population , only to be sent back to " AdSeg " for good when he joined a gang brawl in a prison chapel . <p> For much of the past two years , he spent 23 hours a day in a cell at Coffield that was furnished only with a single bunk , a steel toilet and a narrow ribbon of concrete floor where he paced  --  five steps one way , five steps back  --  to blow off steam . <p> " It can really drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the bus window . The lack of human contact , even with other inmates , was the most difficult part of his confinement , Coronado says . <p> Before he was taken from his cell at Coffield , driven 75 miles south to the main state prison unit at Huntsville and then released , his only visitor in nearly a year was a USA TODAY reporter who sought his cooperation for this article . His mother 's poor health , his relatives ' busy work schedules and lack of money kept many potential visitors away , Coronado says . <p> In an interview a week before he was released , a nervous Coronado shook as he spoke . His eyes darted from point to point . Asked whether he had requested medical treatment to deal with the effects of isolation , Coronado said he had met with a psychiatrist for a couple of months " just to have somebody to talk to . " <p> " It was getting to me , " he says . <p> When he was n't pacing the cell , he occupied himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime stories ) and writing letters . His daily ritual was interrupted only by the rigid schedule of meal deliveries : <p> Breakfast : 3:30 a.m . <p> Lunch : 9 a.m . <p> Dinner : 3:30 p.m . <p> Exercise time , about 30 minutes to an hour each day alone in a separate caged area , generally depended on which side of the prison unit the guards serviced first . Showers were optional . When Coronado did go to wash , he was put in shackles and was under close watch until he was returned to his cell . <p> " There ai n't nothin ' to see but walls , " he says . " It 's like I could feel the anger building inside of me . The only way I could get myself away from my cell was to write letters to my family . I tried to get the letters to carry me out of there . " <p> Leaving prison , he settles into one of the bus ' window seats on an overcast Friday . Coronado says the tall , brick prison walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in maximum security . <p> As the bus turns on to Interstate 45 south toward Houston , many of the inmates aboard shriek in delight . There are high-fives and a few middle fingers pointed back toward the prison . A smiling Coronado never looks back . <p> " Thanks for going Greyhound , " the stocky bus driver calls out . <p> ' Very little is being done ' <p> In nearly every case in which American Civil Liberties Union attorney David Fahti has challenged the conditions of solitary confinement in super max prisons , the lawsuits describe how long-term isolation promotes physical deterioration and mental illness in the inmates . <p> In Wisconsin , Connecticut , New Mexico , Ohio , California and Florida , Fahti and the ACLU have gone to court to protest what the attorney describes as a " life-shattering " policy of punishment that stops just short of the death penalty . <p> Under the terms of one settlement with the ACLU , Connecticut officials last year withdrew inmates the state had sent to a super max unit in Virginia , which had extra prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined in extreme isolation . <p> In Massachusetts , a campaign has been launched by the American Friends Service Committee to abolish the practice of disciplinary segregation . Legislators also are sponsoring proposals that would force the state to track inmates released from solitary confinement as a way to more accurately measure recidivism . <p> " This should be a huge concern in this country , not just because of what is happening inside prisons , which is catastrophic , " Fahti says . " Very little is being done to help these people transition back home . And most of them are getting out . " <p> Grassian , the Harvard psychiatrist who has testified in cases brought against prison systems , says some of the hundreds of inmates he has interviewed have called him after their release " in desperate straits . " <p> " In some cases , their ability to think and to reason is totally gone , " Grassian says . <p> Texas prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald makes no apologies for the state 's use of disciplinary segregation . He says that in the mid-1980s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials began to use isolation cells to restore order and break up criminal groups . <p> Fitzgerald credits the strategy with reducing Texas ' prison homicides from 20 to 30 a year in the 1980s to single digits now . Since September 2001 , there have been four slayings in Texas ' prison system , which has nearly 150,000 inmates , he says . <p> " Given our clientele , " Fitzgerald says , " you could go to any city of equal size and probably not find those kind of numbers . Clearly , this plan works . " <p> Since 1995 , the number of beds assigned to segregation units in Texas ' prison system has jumped from 7,066 to more than 9,000 this year . Although a few other states have a higher percentage of their inmates in isolation , Texas ' prison system  --  the nation 's second-largest behind California 's  --  has far more inmates in such units than any other state , according to the Criminal Justice Institute survey . <p> Though prison officials laud inmate isolation plans , there is growing concern among some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Within six months , the Texas Department of Criminal Justice plans to start providing education and " re-entry " programs to inmates who are in isolation , lifting a prohibition that has been in place for years . <p> " There is a significant need for release preparation services to be developed and offered to this particular population , " the department said in a recent report , adding that isolated inmates " pose a serious risk to the community . " <p> The challenges back home <p> Seven hours into Coronado 's 340-mile trip home , he is still enthralled by the passing scenery . He is dazzled by the lights in the small towns of Refugio , Robstown and Kingsville . During a stop in Refugio , Coronado savors a burger from Dairy Queen . <p> When his eyes are n't glued to the window , he picks through the onion sack for letters he received in prison . One of the last ones came Nov. 2 from his brother , who was being held in a segregation unit less than a mile from Coronado 's cell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there and look out for Timmy ( at 16 , the youngest of the Coronado brothers ) . He 's still young , even though he says he knows what he 's doing . Look out for Mom , Angel . Help her find a good place to live . I 'll be back here waiting for my day to come . <p> Love , <p> Danny Boy <p> In a sense , the letter is a reminder of what Angel Coronado faces back in Donna : relatives who have gotten on with their lives , the temptations of street life , a difficult hunt for a job , and a decision on whether to try to finish his last two years of high school . <p> He has no special skills and only vague plans . <p> " Eventually , I 'd like to get a job in construction , " he says . <p> His grandfather , Natividad Nino , a longtime local carpenter , says he 'll try to teach the trade to his grandson . But skilled craftsmen are struggling along the U.S. border , Nino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' I might go cruising ' <p> What seems to worry Coronado the most is how he 'll handle his first encounter with the homeboys he left behind . <p> " I might go cruising with them , " he says . " But I have to know when it 's time to go home . I ca n't go back " to prison . <p> Mancias , the former judge , says Coronado is " coming back to one of the poorest counties in the nation . It 's a bad , bad place for somebody like Angel . His experience in prison will make things more difficult . I 'd say the chances are less than 25% he 'll be able to stay out " of prison . <p> It is nearly 1 a.m . Saturday  --  about 13 hours after his release  --  when Coronado finally arrives at his mother 's crowded apartment in Donna , setting off an explosion of emotion . <p> Two sisters , several nieces , brother Timmy and Coronado 's mother , Trinidad , swarm him in a family embrace in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been waiting for , " Trinidad Coronado says when the family scrum moves inside . " I 've got one more son ( Danny ) to go and that will complete my life . " <p> Ten days later , Coronado landed a job as landscaper 's helper , making $ 5.20 an hour . He pulls weeds and plants shrubs and says he has n't hung out with his old gang . <p> He says he 's happy . <p> " I like being outside .
