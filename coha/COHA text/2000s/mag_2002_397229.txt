In her perilous first year of life , micro-preemie Courtney Jackson defies all odds-and thrives // On June 19 Courtney Rose Jackson 's parents placed her on the dining room table , smack in front of her first birthday cake . She fixed the confection with an expression of utmost seriousness . Then , just as her mother , Jennifer , 26 , remarked , " Uh-oh , she 's going to grab the cake , " the 1-yearold lunged . After tasting her icing-coated fingers , Courtney opened her blue eyes wide and burst out laughing . A circle of relatives looked just as amazed . " A year ago it was hard to believe she was even going to make it , " said her father , Chris , 27 . " She was so small . " When Courtney came into the world , after only 23 weeks in her mother 's womb , she weighed 460 grams-a fraction over 1 lb . Her heart was the size of a child 's knuckle and a mere eight teaspoons of blood flowed through her 11-in. body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a micropreemie , probably would not have survived . Even today , at many U.S. hospitals doctors choose not to treat infants born before 24 weeks and weighing less than 500 grams ( about 18 oz . ) . Though no hard numbers exist , doctors agree that for the earliest preemies the odds of survival are slim . " These babies really do n't have good success at all , " says Dr. John Widness , a neonatal pediatrician at Children 's Hospital of Iowa , one of the few facilities whose policy is to try to save them . But geography was on Courtney 's side . Children 's Hospital is two hours from her parents ' Bloomfield , Iowa , home . " Twenty-three weeks in most parts of the United States is still considered a gray area , the edge of life , " says Dr. Edward Bell , the hospital 's director of neonatology . " We are almost at the point where we consider it routine to save 23-week babies . " Photograph June 23,2001 : " She was so fragile , " says mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My baby is crying , ' says Jennifer parents " I 'm glad to hear my baby is crying , ' ' " says Jennifer . " I 'm glad to hear my baby cry Photograph July 17,2001 : , I was in shock probably for the first few weeks of Courtney 's life , " says Jennifer ( at the hospital with Chris ) . " This little thing did n't even look like a baby . " Photograph July 17 , 2001 : " I hate to have a baby this small go through surgery , " said Dr. Jeff Segar about the heart operation . // That is not to say , Bell cautions , that doctors at his hospital will automatically treat a micro-preemie , who stands a 25 to 30 percent chance of suffering severe handicaps such as cerebral palsy and blindness . " There must be an agreement with the parents , " he says , " that we can stop treatment if things are not going well . " In Courtney 's case , her mother was unable to make any decisions : She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of June 18 , 2001 , Jennifer , the director of a daycare center , had a splitting headache and was vomiting once an hour . Chris , a carpenter , insisted that she call her obstetrician , Lynn Birchmier . As Jennifer spoke to her , Birchmier recalls , " all of a sudden she started making this high-pitched moaning noise . " Jennifer had suffered a seizure , the first of four she would endure before she was eventually taken by ambulance from a medical center near her home to Iowa City , 95 miles away . As Birchmier suspected , Jennifer had eclampsia , a condition that causes blood pressure to soar , resulting in strokes , brain swelling and kidney failure . Doctors do n't know what causes eclampsia , but if left untreated it would have killed Jennifer , as it does three women for every 200,000 births . The only cure is to deliver the baby . When she arrived at the hospital , Jennifer was semicomatose , and within hours doctors were gently asking Chris whether they should try to save his daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Dr Wendy Hansen , Jennifer 's obstetrician at Children 's Hospital . " At less than 24 weeks , some couples would say no because they do n't want the prospect of a handicapped child . Chris was carrying the world on his shoulders , but did n't let it show . " Chris told the team , " I want you to do everything you can to save my wife and our baby . " At 1:19 p.m. on June 19 , with six doctors and three nurses in attendance , Courtney was born by cesarean section . There were no visible birth defects . " She is , " Hansen recalls thinking , " a perfect little creature . " While the obstetricians concentrated on Jennifer , a pediatrician intubated Courtney , whose undeveloped lungs made breathing a struggle . " As we put the tube in her tiny mouth , she reached up and hit our hands away , " says pediatrician Nicole Schmidt . " She showed she was a fighter . " The infant was then whisked to the neonatal intensive care unit ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilator and monitoring machines and covered in plastic wrap for warmth . But she was hardly out of danger . " Never trust a preemie , " Schmidt says . She was right . Four days later doctors discovered that Courtney had a serious condition called patent ductus arteriosus , in which a blood vessel in the heart fails to close , causing the lungs to fill with fluid . Doctors tried to correct the condition with medication , but warned that surgery might be necessary . While Chris spent his time shuttling between his wife 's room and the NICU down the hall , Jennifer was n't emotionally or physically strong enough to visit her daughter for two days . Though her blood pressure soon returned to normal , her mind remained foggy . " I felt so out of it , even though Chris told me over and over again what had happened , " she says . " I did n't even expect to have a baby for another three months . " When she saw Courtney , whose face and body were barely visible behind a mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mute . Finally , with just one finger , she touched her baby for the first time . " I was in a state of shock , " she says . " It was scary . " Like all neonatal intensive care units , the one at Children 's Hospital can be intimidating . Because the babies have breathing tubes stuck down their throats , their cries ca n't be heard . But the high-tech machines that keep them alive are rigged with alarm bells to warn the staff of problems , and the cacophony often terrifies parents . But the NICU nurses , while attending to all the details necessary to keep their fragile charges alive , also find time to sing to the infants and stroke their tiny limbs . The combination of high-tech care and hands-on tenderness has had results : Of the two dozen 23-week preemies treated at Children 's Hospital between 1996 and 2000 , 18 survived . " So much of what we do is based on gut instinct and not on numbers , " says Kristin Ward , one of Courtney 's nurses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter for the first time , 27 days after she was born . Normally , parents ca n't hold preemies until they 're in stable condition , which can take a month . But after it was determined that medication was n't solving Courtney 's heart problem-and that she would have to undergo surgeryneonatologist John Dagle made an exception . He helped place Courtney and her tangle of wires in her mother 's lap . Jennifer stared into her daughter 's eyes and whispered , " Hi , sweetie . " When Courtney was back in her crib , Jennifer thanked Dagle , adding , " I 'm happy now . " The next day doctors anesthetized the tiny girl , swathed her body with Betadine and placed her on her side . The operation , which usually takes one hour , lasted 42 minutes longer because nurses had to go searching for a rib spreader small enough to use on Courtney . Surgeons located her heart and clamped the vessel shut with a 3mm metal clip . Afterward Courtney displayed her usual feistiness . When she awoke from the anesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the nurses , setting off alarms . " She is definitely her mother 's daughter , " says Chris . " She lets you know when she does n't like something . " And , like her mother , when she does . Jennifer knew she would marry Chris by their second date . " He cared for everyone so much , and I loved his sense of humor , " she says . Though they had both grown up in Bloomfield , a three-stoplight town of 2,580 , the couple met for the first time in 1996 in the parking lot of the local Pizza Hut , where Jennifer was a waitress and Chris-then studying physical therapy at Truman State Universitywas hanging out with pals . He admired her devotion to her younger brother and two sisters , whom she had cared for while their divorced mother worked nights , and was amused by her obsession with the Tasmanian Devil cartoon character . Good thing : When they wed in May 1997 , Jennifer says , " I wore a long white satin dress that Chris 's grandmother made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tried to have children . Jennifer finally became pregnant , but miscarried in December 2000 after just six weeks . She was pregnant again the next month , this time with Courtney . Everything went smoothly until week 23 . " Jennifer had no bad habits , " says neonatologist Bell . " She was just unlucky . " Her luck improved-though a bit too slowly for her taste . After three months , Courtney was still not ready to leave the hospital , and her parents were exhausted by the four-hour round trip they made several times a week from their home . Though Courtney 's care , which has so far topped $547,000 , is paid by Medicaid , Chris still had to work full-time and Jennifer hated staying overnight on the ward without him . The doctors declared that Courtney could n't leave until she was off the ventilator , could warm herself without an incubator and take all her nutrition from either a bottle or her mother 's breast . When Jennifer , who had been pumping and freezing her milk since Courtney 's birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , she declared , " I am going to prove the doctors wrong . " Photograph Nov. 21 , 2001 : " I 'm truly overjoyed and ecstatic , " said Chris soon after bringing Courtney home for the first time . " We wo n't miss the hospital at all . " Photograph June 19 , 2002 : " She is rarely still and very stubborn , " says Chris of Courtney ( on her first birthday , with Jennifer and relatives ) . // In fact , her daughter did . Despite a bout of jaundice and a paralyzed vocal cord resulting from the surgery ( doctors expect it will have no long-term effect on her voice ) , Courtney was well enough to be released after five months . " Oh , I ca n't wait ! " said Jennifer . " It 's been awful going home without our baby . " Though Chris admitted to being nervous , he and Jennifer felt confident enough to take over their daughter 's care after nurses taught them how to operate her oxygen tank and read her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's homecoming by hosting Thanksgiving dinner for their extended family . Said Chris 's overjoyed mother , Debbie Van Horn , 49 : " Now everyone can settle down and just enjoy her . " Chris and Jennifer refused to let Courtney out of their sight for a moment . Even now , she sleeps in a wooden cradle next to their water bed . Courtney still requires oxygen , but her lungs are getting stronger , and unlike most micro-preemies , she has not had to be hospitalized for a respiratory illness . She weighs 18 lbs . 1 oz.approaching the normal range for her age-partly , says Chris , because " she gobbles down sweet potatoes and banana pudding like there 's no tomorrow . " Although it is too early to tell whether Courtney will have learning disabilities-another common problem among micro-preemies  --  so far she shows no signs of developmental delays . " She 's doing beautifully , " says pediatrician Schmidt . " She may be walking before we know it . " These days Courtney accompanies her mother to work at the daycare center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated readings of Goodnight Moon . She also adores being the center of attention-but come Christmastime , if all goes as expected she will have to make room for a baby brother . Jennifer is being monitored closely by the doctors at Children 's Hospital . Meanwhile the Jacksons watch gratefully as their firstborn grows into a little girl . " I can have the worst day , " says Chris . " But when I come home and look at her , I 'm in a good mood .
