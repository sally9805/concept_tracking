<p> BLACK MESA , Ariz.  --  On the last day of 2005 , the West 's dirtiest power plant shut down , forcing the coal mine that supplied it to close . That was keenly felt by the nation 's most populous Indian tribe , which lost jobs and millions of dollars in royalties from the world 's largest coal company . <p> Those elements now frame a sticky debate in Indian country about one of the USA 's thorniest policy issues : reliance on traditional energy sources such as oil , gas and coal , vs. developing renewable alternatives such as wind and solar power . <p> A key to the debate is an arcane regulatory mechanism called pollution credits . Polluters , such as coal-fired power plants , buy and sell credits in a commodities-style market designed to help clean up the nation 's smokestacks . A plant that closes and stops polluting earns credits , based on a federal formula , for its owners . <p> In this dispute , an outside coalition of environmental groups for the first time is demanding tens of millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restitution for decades of pollution and , the groups say , undervalued coal royalties . <p> The strategy reflects the growing interest across the country in claiming credits as compensation . <p> " Environmental groups are saying , ' These are really valuable . Why do n't we allocate them beyond the plants ? ' " says Thaddeus Huetteman , vice chairman of Power &; Energy Analytic Resources in Atlanta , a trading and consulting firm . <p> Tribal leaders are in talks aimed at reopening the mine and the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin , Nev . But the demand by the grass-roots coalition for the plant 's credits could sabotage those efforts and upend a decades-old status quo on the sprawling Navajo and Hopi reservations . <p> Meanwhile , miners who lost the highest-paying reservation jobs are suffering . " This was my dream ever since I was small , to live on the reservation , live on my homeland where my grandparents set a site for me , " says K.J. Clitso , who 's trying to support his wife , six children and a $400-a-month mortgage on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd hate to leave . " <p> The coalition says credits that the power plant owners will amass by keeping their facility closed could finance solar and wind energy development and create jobs . <p> In January , the Indian groups Black Mesa Trust , Indigenous Environmental Network and other coalition members took their proposal to the California Public Utilities Commission , which regulates the 1,585-megawatt power plant . Southern California Edison is the majority owner of the plant . <p> " The ( coal ) mine 's negative impacts are now far greater than the positive , but the tribe is doing everything it can to keep it open , " says Nicole Horseherder , co-director of the coalition group To ' Nizhoni Ani  --  Navajo for " beautiful water speaks . " <p> " That 's not self-determination . That 's continuing this unhealthy relationship where we 're totally dependent . " <p> The credits are crucial to the coalition 's proposal . If the credits are put on the market , another plant probably would buy them to offset its own pollution and stay within federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't released into the air , a plant gets one credit worth $1,000 . Mohave belched 53,000 tons of sulfur dioxide a year , or about $53 million worth of credits in the current market . <p> The coalition , backed with consulting help from the Sierra Club and the Grand Canyon Trust , argues that Mohave has fouled Western skies since 1971 , and it 's pay-back time . With Mohave 's credits , the coalition envisions a " just transition " to a clean-energy economy . <p> " I 'm personally sympathetic to the plight of these Indians , " says Michael Peevey , the California PUC president . " But should California rate-payers be paying for the investments and job training they want ? You could argue either side . " <p> An administrative law judge will hear the case before the PUC makes a decision . That could take months , Peevey says . <p> Southern California Edison , Mohave 's main owner , says in a PUC filing that some " ill-defined group " of Hopis and Navajos has no legal claim to a " windfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peabody Western Coal Co. , labels the coalition a " vocal minority . " The Navajo government opposes the coalition plan . The Hopi government 's priority is to reopen the mine but , in case it does n't , wants the PUC to account for Mohave 's credits . <p> In pollution-trading markets , sulfur dioxide credits hit a high of $1,630 a ton in late December before falling to around $1,000 a ton today . In 2003 , they were trading at $220 . <p> As prices rose , owners of some coal-fired power plants found it economical to clean up polluting plants because they could pay for it by selling newly earned credits . <p> Tribes face hardships <p> Peabody has no way to transport Black Mesa coal other than a 273-mile slurry line from the mine to Mohave . Navajos who held most of the 200 mine and slurry positions have few job options . Peabody estimates Black Mesa 's annual economic benefit to the tribes at $90 million in royalties , wages , benefits , taxes , fees and supplier payments . <p> Clitso made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line but now must make cutbacks in his own life . A new GMC pickup had to go back to the dealer . Leased solar panels that supplied electricity at $95 a month were turned off . Satellite TV became an unaffordable luxury . Contributions to the kids ' college fund were put on hold . With health insurance terminated , the family relies on a free clinic . They take fewer trips to town . <p> Clitso , 39 , had been at the mine five years since moving from Salt Lake City , where he worked in a slaughterhouse . Like many Indians living in remote areas , the Clitsos have no access to plumbing , and they heat and cook with wood and coal . His 50 acres is 10 miles of bumpy dirt road from the nearest pavement . <p> " I thought I had a good job going , " Clitso says . " If I move to another job , and that means losing my homeland , everything will be turned around . " <p> Strong opinions on both sides <p> Andy Blackwater , 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to retire when he found himself out of a job on New Year 's Day with no severance after 32 years . He hopes to be rehired if the mine reopens but realizes that 's a long shot . For years , Blackwater says , tribal officials knew the mine might close but did nothing . " The tribe should have its own economy and not depend on Peabody , " he says . <p> The coalition is lobbying tribal councils and far-flung chapters , but critics point out that it offers little more than a proposal on paper . " Who 's going to buy this power ? How will they get it to market ? There 're very few transmission lines out there , " says Harris Sherman , a lawyer for the Hopis . <p> Both tribes ' governments have federally funded projects to measure wind and solar energy potential on the reservations . But for now , they 're intent on getting Black Mesa and Mohave running again . <p> Whether that happens is tied up with why they closed in the first place . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment to clean up sulfur dioxide emissions or shut Mohave down by the end of 2005 . <p> The deadline passed with no cleanup , closing the plant and mine . The tribes , Edison and Peabody hope to resume operations as before while cleanup equipment is installed , Sherman says . That could take three years . The lawsuit 's plaintiffs , people living around Mohave who complained of respiratory illnesses from the plant 's pollution , would have to agree . <p> For now , miners remain idle . Which is OK with sheepherders such as Dan Herder , 53 , who have to haul water to their livestock because springs and ponds are dry . Herder is n't eager for the mine to reopen . <p> " We 've seen a lot of changes in the land , especially in the last 20 years , " he says . " Nature 's out of balance , is how we look at it . We were here before the mine . " PHOTO , Color , Jill Torrance for USA TODAY PHOTO , B/W , Jill Torrance for USA @
