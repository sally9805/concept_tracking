He rode into the American League Championship Series , which had begun without him an hour earlier , in the back of a blue Cadillac with police cruisers providing an escort . ? " Want me to put the game on ? " the driver asked . ? " No , " Mariano Rivera replied . ? The New York Yankees ' closer stared out the window , and though it was New Jersey on the other side of the smoked glass , he still saw Panama and the two cherrywood coffins that had been lowered into the ground of his homeland just hours before . On Oct. 9 a 14year-old boy , Victor Avila Jr. , had been electrocuted in the pool at Rivera 's house in Puerto Caimito , and when the boy 's father dived in to try to rescue his son , he , too , had perished . They were cousins of Rivera 's wife , Clara . Three days later Rivera wept for the father and the son at a funeral mass in a church the pitcher had built . He attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prayers , on a private G-4 jet to New Jersey as the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox renewed their little rivalry with a spot in the World Series at stake . ? " You sure ? " the driver asked . ? " Oh , O.K. Go ahead , " Rivera said , and he listened to the ball game silently on the 15-minute drive to Yankee Stadium . ? So began a harsh week of October baseball that would test Rivera 's stamina and his faith . The Yankees may have assembled a modern-day Murderers ' Row of a lineup , and the baseball postseason may look strikingly like home run derby this year , but the ALCS proved that the fulcrum of the Yankees ' October is the same as it has been for eight years . It is their closer , Rivera . // In the first five games against Boston , New York manager Joe Torre summoned Rivera four times in the eighth inning to lock down leads . Rivera succeeded twice within the 48 hours after burying the Avilas , giving him a win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postseason victories since he became their finisher in 1997 . But on the third and fourth tries , once with the Yankees three outs from the World Series and then six outs from advancing , Rivera let the leads slip away . // A sweep ? Yeah , right . Yankees --  Red Sox is never neat and clean . The rivalry is guaranteed magma , smoldering and always on the verge of eruption , whether the great Rivera is on hand or not . New York had been 53 -- 3 under Torre when it had a lead with six or fewer outs to go in the postseason until Boston stole Games 4 and 5 . Each of those games ended with a swing of the bat from DH David Ortiz . After the Red Sox tied Game 4 against Rivera in the ninth , Ortiz won it with a two-run , 12th-inning homer off Paul Quantrill at the ridiculously late hour of 1:22 a.m . EDT on Monday . " It 's all right , " a weary Rivera remarked after the 6 -- 4 defeat . " Hey , it 's one game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . " // And then Ortiz did it again in Game 5 , the ultimate Boston marathon , this time with a walk-off single to bring home Johnny Damon from second in the 14th inning for a 5 -- 4 win . Never before in franchise history had the Yankees lost consecutive extra-inning postseason games , and in each case their touchstone of a closer left wounded . // For three consecutive evenings in Boston , the ancient rivals played deep into the night , each game longer and more excruciating than the one before : four hours 20 minutes ; five hours , two minutes ; and -- in the longest postseason game ever played -- five hours , 49 minutes on Monday night . The two teams combined for 15 hours , 11 minutes of baseball played to exhaustion and exhilaration before three packed houses at Fenway Park . // Let down by a thin bullpen , Torre brought in Rivera in Game 5 with runners at first and third , no outs and ahead 4 -- 3 , a lead already narrowed at the outset of the inning by an Ortiz home run off wobbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at the expense of a run , as Jason Varitek flied deep enough to centerfield to bring home the tying run . It was the third blown save of this postseason for Rivera , a man who had blown only two in 32 previous postseason chances . // A game Rivera gave Torre a shutout inning thereafter , finally leaving after throwing 62 pitches over consecutive nights . The Yankees would lose yet another war of attrition , this time with Esteban Loaiza , their seventh pitcher , surrendering the deciding hit . The Red Sox , who birthed the Impossible Dream season of 1967 , kept hope alive to complete Mission Impossible of 2004 : coming back from a three-games-to-none deficit to win a seven-game series . Baseball teams in such a hole were 0 -- 25 alltime , while pro basketball and hockey teams so challenged were 2 -- 236. // At the rate the Red Sox and the Yankees beat up on one another in the ALCS ( they ranked one-two in runs , respectively , in the league this season ) while the St. Louis Cardinals and the Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National League Championship Series ( they ranked first and sixth in runs , respectively , in the league ) , the World Series figures to be a shootout reminiscent of the one in 1993 . That year the Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies combined for 81 runs in six games , and one fan was moved to hoist a sign that read will pitch middle relief for food . All four LCS teams this year featured deep lineups with quick-strike capability but disproportionately thin pitching staffs . // the national league Championship Series , for instance , seemed to be a glorified game of HORSE between Carlos Beltran of the Astros and Albert Pujols of the Cardinals ( page 48 ) . With a 3 -- 0 victory in Houston on Monday night , the Astros took a three-games-to-two lead into Wednesday 's Game 6. // The 10 LCS games through Monday featured a total of 33 home runs . The rate of 3.3 dingers per game was 50% higher than the regular-season rate of 2.2 . So much for pitching and defense in October . // No lead was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took over Boston in Game 1 while starter Mike Mussina was throwing a perfect game one out into the seventh inning . In a New York minute -- well , before the Yankees could get five more outs , anyway -- the Sox had the tying run at third base and Kevin Millar at the plate . That 's when Torre summoned the heartsick Rivera , who had spent most of the plane ride from Panama that day in deep prayer . " Give me the strength to go through it , " Rivera prayed , " and watch over me and keep me safe . " // Rivera is a deeply religious man who traces his piety to 1994 , when his wife was hospitalized to have her gall bladder removed , leaving Rivera alone with the couple 's then six-month-old baby , also named Mariano . Rivera says that many friends provided care for the baby while he attended to Clara . " Out of nowhere I have more people than my whole family , " Rivera says . " That was provided by the Lord . " // Rivera arrived at Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locker surrounded by floral arrangements sent by sympathetic fans -- and joined his bullpen mates in the fifth . Three innings later , with his fourth pitch , he retired Millar on a pop-up . New York tacked on a pair of insurance runs to win 10 -- 7. // Rivera answered a similar alarm the next night in the eighth inning ; he preserved Jon Lieber 's 3 -- 1 win by striking out Johnny Damon with a runner on third , then set down Boston in the ninth . Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez said of Rivera afterward , " It 's Jordanesque , what he 's doing . He 's one of the most impressive people I 've known in or out of baseball . When I think about what he 's done over the past 48 hours , it puts him on an even higher pedestal . And I did n't think that was possible . " // rivera 's heroics came amid the usual disdain and wariness that mark any meeting of the Yankees and the Red Sox . Boston manager Terry Francona , for instance , argued one inning into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting hand signals from a radar-gun-toting employee in the stands indicating the speed of the pitches of Red Sox starter Curt Schilling , who left the game after three innings with a balky right ankle . ( Baseball vice president Sandy Alderson , seated next to the man in question , denied that such activity had taken place . ) Meanwhile , a Yankees official noticed on a television monitor that Boston relief pitcher Curt Leskanic was illegally wiping pine tar on his hands just before entering the game . " We 'll just keep it in our pocket for now , " the official said . // Devoid of such subterfuge , last Saturday 's Game 3 at Fenway was nothing but blunt proof of the Yankees ' might . The last thing the Red Sox saw before they left their clubhouse that evening was a handwritten message on the whiteboard attached to the door : we can make history ! believe it ! They did , all right : They allowed more total bases ( 44 ) than any other team in postseason history . " They just basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // New York set a franchise record this season with 242 home runs , two more than its fabled ' 61 team . These Yankees , however , became an especially potent offensive team when Torre moved Rodriguez from third to second in the lineup , behind leadoff hitter Derek Jeter . Through Monday the Yankees had averaged 6.6 runs per game with A-Rod hitting second , up from 5.4 when he wasn't. // Rodriguez , Gary Sheffield , Hideki Matsui and Bernie Williams ( the 2-3-4-5 hitters ) combined for 16 hits and 15 RBIs in Game 3 . Matsui tied postseason records with five hits and five runs , and by the sixth inning of Game 4 would have the record for extra-base hits ( eight ) to himself . Until Matsui whiffed in the ninth inning , the Red Sox had thrown 66 pitches to him in the series , and he had swung at and missed only one . " No matter where it 's pitched , he 's putting a good swing on it , " Boston general manager Theo Epstein said before Game 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out . Their 2-3-4 hitters are having unbelievable at bats . " // The Red Sox did shut down the Yankees ' 2-3-4-5 hitters in Game 4 : They were 4 for 21 , including nine hitless at bats against the Boston bullpen after New York had taken a 4 -- 3 lead into the seventh . // The Yankees were three outs from the World Series when Rivera walked Millar , the leadoff man in the ninth . Pinch runner Dave Roberts stole second base , then scored on a single by Bill Mueller after Mueller had shown bunt on the first two pitches . " I definitely thought he was bunting on the third pitch , " Rivera said . " But I walked the first guy . That was the key . " // Three innings later , when the last of the 11 pitchers used in the game threw the last of the 394 pitches in the last of the 302 minutes elapsed , Ortiz won it . Ortiz , who had ended Boston 's Division Series sweep of the Anaheim Angels with a home run , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postseason . And the Red Sox became the first team since the 1910 Chicago Cubs to stave off a four-game sweep with an extra-inning win . // The Red Sox had extended the series even though , through four games , they had kept the Yankees off base in only four of the 37 innings they 'd played and their pitchers had faced a total of four batters while holding a lead . It has been that kind of October , an October flush with offense . It is the time of year that tests even the greatest of pitchers , body and soul .
