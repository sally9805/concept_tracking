IN DAYLIGHT THE ROAD between the nameless bar and Random 's East Side Pawn was surely bleak , but on a rainy November night the pavement shimmered beneath a sea of neon colors . To the couple in the car , the little strip of civilization appeared like an oasis from a landscape of deserted warehouses and dead-end turns , but instead of stopping the man drove on . <p> " Where are you going ? " the woman said at last . <p> She turned on the seat to gauge his expression , for it flustered him to be lost , and the fluster often took the form of irritation . At the least he would be annoyed that she had asked . Three weeks ago he had lost his job , and in everything since he had been quick to perceive injustice or slight . " Do you want to drive ? " he snapped even as she anticipated the jolt and swiveled her head . At the same instant the boy dove out of darkness . She knew it was a boy , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket and dark hair . The wheel thunked , and the body flew across the hood . <p> " Jesus Christ , " her husband said . <p> Later it seemed to her that for a full minute they sat listening to the motor tick while they waited for the shock to release them into action , but she was wrong . Before the car stopped , she had flung her door open . She was on her knees , blind in the headlamps that lit only rain , feeling with her hands along the slick street and cinder shoulder ; then she was running . Behind the car her husband knelt over a dark form . " I ca n't tell if he 's alive or not , " he said in a voice so weak it guttered . He stood . " We 'll need to find a phone . " Her hair stuck to her face in wet strands ; she had lost her shoes . In the rain she could n't tell if she was crying , but she knew it was a boy ; they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name that Eva whispered as she crouched beside the boy while Guy searched out a phone . She was reluctant to touch him , for fear she might injure him further . The flashlight was dead . She had nothing to cover him with , but she held her umbrella over his head , murmuring , " It 's OK , you 're going to be OK , " just in case he could hear . She could n't tell if he was breathing . He seemed smaller than she 'd thought , smaller than her son Nick , who was eight but big for his age . It was her son she thought about . <p> She remembered the night in the hospital just after he was born , how she seemed to swim out of sleep and there he was , wrapped like a gift inside the nurse 's arms , and she said , " Hello , it 's my little barracuda , " in a voice already rich with love . " You hold them like a football , " the nurse instructed . ( Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the nurse had written on Eva 's chart , all the joy and wonder Eva had thought possible for anyone to feel scaled down to fit inside the name of an ordinary biological process . <p> He had seemed so fragile . For a week , every time she passed the hammer in the basement stairwell she was seized by a vision of Nickie 's skull . She did n't know whether she was more horrified by the vision or herself , and she wanted Guy to move it , but she could n't ask for fear he would confirm that she was crazy . But she was n't crazy-it was just that Nickie was so tiny ; she was overwhelmed by the tangle of love and responsibility such a small and precious creature made . She grew into the job , of course , and Nickie grew so obviously sturdy that the weight of her guardianship seemed scarcely more than a set of routine maxims ( take your raincoat , wear your helmet , call me when you get there ) . But now , as she crouched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had eight years ago , when she was so nuts with postpartum hormones she was afraid she would pick up a hammer and smash his skull . She must be a monster after all . The child beside her was surely dead or dying , and what she thought about was her son . <p> Her legs ached . Water puddled on the pavement , her dress was soaked , and she was cold . She wondered if the boy was cold . Never move the victim ; always keep him warm . What else ? She knew to put baking soda on a beesting and ice on a burn ; she kept syrup of ipecac in the medicine chest and the number of Poison Control taped to the phone . If her son choked , she could do the Heimlich ; in ninth-grade health she 'd even practiced mouth-to-mouth ( like every other girl in the class , Eva had prayed to draw Bucky Stiles as her partner , but that was more than thirty years ago , and the class had resuscitated a prim , giggling boy-boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she probably had n't checked the flashlight batteries for a year . Who knew how long it would take the ambulance to arrive , how far Guy would have to walk before he could call ? <p> Her eyes filled , and she bent over the boy . " It 's OK , " she promised , touching his wet hair , longer than Nick 's and thick . His arm was flung out at an ominous angle . She could n't feel any blood , but perhaps the rain washed it away . " We 're getting you help , they 're coming , they 're almost here . " The umbrella tipped , and to help him she had to sit up and take her hand away . <p> She could n't bear to think about his parents-watching television , maybe , or asleep . A lurch of pity tore her chest . It seemed hideous that they should not yet know . If it were Nickie-Nick , he was growing up , he wanted them to call him Nick now-she would want to be with him if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and get here before this child dies . She closed her eyes , repeating , Do n't die , do n't die , do n't die until she felt she must be screaming , but the hysteria passed like the initial shock ; she had been sitting here beside him for so long that in another way she felt quite calm . It seemed hours since Guy had left , so many that it felt as if everything else in her life had been a dream and all she had ever really done was to wait beside this boy , who had never spoken to her and never would . <p> Then she panicked again , because it terrified her that Nick could feel so far away he seemed no more than an illusion . <p> " Hurry up , " she whispered again , disoriented now , wandering her mind like an unmapped building , where in one room she found her husband , in another her son , in yet another her husband and her son . Down this hall were the boy 's parents and their unsuspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence she and Guy would soon inhabit . Yet in another room it was only Saturday night and raining , and she sat on the floor like an abandoned date with aching legs and ruined clothing . And at the same time she seemed to occupy one room at a time , she was in all of them at once , including that last room , where all the minutes she had waited turned to hours and she had waited so long she was bored . <p> She felt so sorry for Guy . No one could have stopped . Lost , impatient with the stubbornness with which he nurtured error , she wished that she had been driving . It could as easily have happened to her . Again she saw the boy fly across the hood . What had made him pitch forward like that ? If he 'd gone over the handlebars of a bicycle they would have found the bike . But why would a kid be bicycling at midnight in the rain ? Where were his parents ? <p> It seemed so unbelievably unfair that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name , she thought , he would not die , and it was n't fair , it was so unfair that he should have to depend upon her ignorance to save him . <p> No fair , that 's not fair ; it was the childhood refrain to which she always answered , Of course it 's not fair . Fair is where you go to see horses and cows . But she 'd been too busy to take Nick to see the horses and cows the past two years , and he did n't think that was fair either . <p> " It 's not fair , " she had said the day Guy was terminated . <p> " It 's not your fault , " she had repeated , until the words wore so thin that light passed through their skin to reveal a darker bone of meaning inside , as if what she really meant to say was that it was n't hers . <p> She was there with him in the front seat . The accident had happened to both of them . <p> She forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing , she might know why he was there . Skateboarding , perhaps . Nick maintained a wistful reverence toward skateboards , something he 'd given up on wanting even before the desire set in . Safety was the price you paid for parents who protected you . This boy might be cold and wet and even dead , but her son was warm and dry , asleep in the room she 'd repainted last year , when he outgrew the dinosaurs on his wallpaper border . Downstairs the babysitter was probably eating microwave popcorn and watching MTV . ( " What 's the matter with the way it was ? " Guy asked , though he was the one who blamed her for babying their son . ) They had promised to be home by midnight . She did n't suppose Guy would remember to call Courtney . <p> He was only a child . She glanced at the crumpled form beside her and swallowed tears . She was afraid she would vomit , so she lowered her head and wept until she heard the siren . <p> Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had passed . That he found it so efficiently despite having no sense of direction registered without awareness ; he was only slightly more conscious that he had been right not to stop before : It was a rough neighborhood . Eva never gave him the least benefit of doubt . But he did n't think about her or himself or even the boy . He had found his way back by concentrating on a single image . It was a trick of empowerment he 'd learned from sales : You could do anything you could visualize yourself doing . Over and over he watched himself place his finger in the dial . <p> " Mister ? " the bartender asked as he stepped inside the tavern . <p> " Do you have a telephone ? " Guy replied , but already he 'd seen it , on the wall outside the toilet . It was a touch-tone phone , of course , and for a moment as he stood with the receiver in hand it seemed his failure to anticipate this detail was a defect of character so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the incompetence , the mistakes of judgment , false assumptions , and petty misdeeds of his life having joined into an endless train of fate that pinned him to this moment . Smoke stung his eyes . In his ears the throb of blood confused itself with jukebox rap and the muted crack of pool balls from a back room . <p> " Who you calling , white boy ? " A young man with eyes concealed behind dark glasses took a step toward him , but immediately the bartender said , " The phone be working . Leave the gentlemens make his call . " <p> Guy pressed 911 . Without thinking he had memorized the street signs so he would n't have to inquire where he was . It was hard to tell in the dark , but he did n't think the boy he 'd killed was black , and he was grateful for that . He was the only white man in the room . <p> The dispatcher asked how long he 'd walked . More than ten minutes , less than fifteen , Guy estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no sense of time , though she could n't forgive his misturns and muddled circles . <p> " Honky must think this Southern Bell , " the young man muttered as Guy hung up . It was unthinkable that he bring the police inside , and although it was still raining , he stepped outside to wait . <p> The squad car arrived almost immediately . A lone officer got out , a black man so light-skinned it took Guy a moment to realize he was black . In his uniform he gave the impression of being taller than he was , thick through the shoulders , barrel-chested , with tapered legs and narrow feet . The name on the bar pinned to his pocket was McThune . " You the party who called to report an accident ? " <p> Guy stated his name and address . <p> " Occupation ? " <p> It was the question he 'd been dreading for three weeks . " I was a district manager for the Random Herald . " <p> Wrong . Through the rain sluicing off the brim of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer existed . It had merged with the Gazette in a corporate buyout , and Guy 's job had been eliminated , though he persisted in thinking of it as having been fired . " I 'm unemployed , " he admitted . <p> " Were you the driver of the vehicle ? " <p> " Yes sir . " The sir rankled in Guy 's mouth , a natural response to the unnatural humility an officer 's authority required . he was forty-seven , but he had a teenaged boy 's instinctive animosity for cops . <p> " Step into the light , please . " Guy moved closer to the street . " I 'm going to ask you to perform a few simple tests . " Guy walked a straight line , tracked McThune 's pen , then touched his index fingers to his nose . <p> " Have you had anything to drink tonight ? " <p> " Not for several hours . " <p> " Have you had anything to drink tonight ? " McThune repeated . <p> Guy made an effort to keep his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of wine with . That would have been around seven , at least four and a half hours before the accident . " He felt as if a shot of Novocain had begun to wear off . He was impatient to know what happened to the boy , and his impatience might easily border on anger . It was obvious he was n't drunk . He 'd been to the opera , for Christ 's sake , and he and Eva had Cokes at the intermission . <p> " What time did the accident occur ? " <p> " Twenty minutes ago . I had to walk to a phone . " <p> " Did you check your watch ? " <p> " No . " Guy dislodged his upper lip from a tooth with his tongue . " But I have a very good sense of time . " <p> McThune 's eyes traveled to Guy 's feet and back , as if measuring the extent of his error . " You hit a pedestrian ? " <p> " A kid . He ran in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a taste like chalk at the back of Guy 's throat . " I feel terrible . I have a boy myself . " <p> " All right , I 'm going to have you direct me back to the site so I can get a look at the scene and check out the victim 's condition . After that , if you would n't mind , I 'd like you to come downtown and take a test . " <p> " Is that necessary ? " Guy 's chest tightened . <p> " Your compliance is voluntary , but a refusal is admissible as evidence in court . " <p> The clot of fear inside his chest sent his voice careening . " He just ran right out . Believe me , I would have stopped if I could . " There were no witnesses except Eva . What if he could n't prove that it was n't his fault ? " I do n't have any reason to refuse . The kid tripped or something . It could have happened to anybody . " <p> " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember exactly what happened . " <p> I am perfectly calm , Guy thought angrily . " The kid ran right in front of the car , " he repeated , his voice fading . He could hardly expect a cop to sympathize with a guy who 'd just killed a kid . It was n't his fault , but that did n't make him any less guilty . His stomach plunged , and vinegar filled his mouth . <p> " Let 's go , " McThune said as Guy doubled over the gutter . <p> Guy straightened , wiping his chin . <p> The ambulance arrived before the police . As it approached , Eva made the mistake of looking into the headlights , and then , when she turned back to the boy , her vision whirled with residual blindness . She rose to move out of the way , but the driver called her back to hold the umbrella . She had only a glimpse of the boy 's face before the paramedic eclipsed his upper body . He looked foreign in a way she could n't place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strained to hear the driver . " No respiratory function ; BP extremely weak . Blood in the mouth , evident multiple trauma , assume massive internal injuries , possible hypovolemic . " The umbrella trembled . " Bag him . Let 's get him on the pump . " <p> A police car wailed to the side of the road . Somehow Eva had assumed that Guy would return before the police and EMS arrived , but now an officer was walking toward the ambulance as Guy hung back beside the squad car , surveying the scene as if from a great distance , not seeming to locate either her or the boy . When she returned her attention to the boy , he was strapped to a board , his shirt and jacket cut away , face distorted by the clear green bag . <p> " What 've we got ? " McThune asked . <p> " Multiple trauma , hypovolemic shock . We 're attempting to stabilize for transport . " <p> As a second car pulled in , McThune glanced at the boy , shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a night . " <p> Then Eva was running beside the gurney to the ambulance , still holding the umbrella . <p> Guy had n't moved . " Is he dead ? " he asked when she came to stand beside him . His hair stuck to his skull . <p> " I think he might be , but they 're trying to revive him . " She stared at the three officers in conference with the medic , the rain covers for their hats neon disks in the garish dark . The landscape churned with red and blue lights and the steady rain that splattered through the intermittent bark and rasp of radio static . A sob escaped her . " I do n't know how this happened . " <p> " It was an accident , " Guy said coldly . <p> She sucked her breath until she could speak . " What did the police say ? " She glanced at him as two more cars arrived . " Guy ? Did you tell them what happened ? " <p> " He wanted to know if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Do n't they ? " <p> " I 've got to go downtown to take the Breathalyzer . " <p> As the ambulance pulled out , the siren cut mournfully through the rain , and a gust of emptiness blew through Eva . Suddenly it seemed as if the time she 'd spent waiting with the boy had been no time at all , not nearly enough ; already he was gone , passed from her hands into the vast , impersonal institutions of the hospital and the state . He belonged to her no longer . <p> Guy was cracking his knuckles . Eighteen years they had fallen asleep to the whisper of each other 's breath ; yet as she returned her attention to him , he seemed only vaguely familiar . She had lost the boy . " I 'm sure it 's just routine , " she said . <p> McThune had slipped into his car . Finally he came around to her . <p> " The dispatcher 's sending another unit to help complete the site investigation . Your husband has agreed to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us so I can take your statement . " <p> " The boy , " Eva said , eyes riveted on McThune 's face . " Is he going to die ? " <p> " We 're sending a unit to the hospital . " <p> She nodded . <p> " You ought to get out of the rain , " McThune advised and invited them to wait in the back of his car . <p> Guy slumped on the seat beside her , his face turned toward the window . The car had the smell of wet wool and rubber boots , an odor that never failed to bring elementary school back to Eva . She had been a dutiful student , easily intimidated , overly respectful , more frightened by a misplaced homework assignment than she was of the officer outside . They had done nothing wrong . <p> And yet . . . If the boy died . . . She had known the instant they hit him that the only thing she had to lose that could make it up was Nick . If the boy died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged breath , and her fingers dug into her palm , as if he had already slipped from her grip . . . . She could n't bear to think about it . <p> Guy continued to stare at the steamy window . <p> She should never have asked him where they were going . <p> " Did you call Courtney ? " she asked . He had been the rebel . Yet in the last year or so , as one thing after another faltered or fell short , he seemed not merely depressed ( she was depressed ; her career was n't going so well , either ) but cowed . She groped for his hand . " It 's OK . I 'll call from the station . " His silence was stiff with affront . She hoped the police would n't make him too defensive . He was so touchy-it was understandable ; he 'd lost his job . But she was afraid he would lose his temper too . <p> " It was n't your fault , " she said . <p> At the station Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait while he took her husband 's statement . <p> The interview took place in a closet furnished with a narrow table and three plastic seats . If he had imagined the setting , Guy would have pictured a common room , an enormous space of desked-off territories , ringing typewriters and phones , less an image he 'd absorbed from TV ( actually he did n't watch much except sports ) than a grafting of old cop shows with his memory of the city room before carpeting , partitions , and the muted click and hum of electronics had given newspapers the bland face of an insurance office . The chair was too small for him . He was tall and lanky , a fact that contributed to the boyish impression he still made in his late forties , and the standard-issue seats of public places , cut to the unisex scale of the average person , made him feel gawky and adolescent . On the other side of the table , McThune had removed his hat . He was bald , a fact that , discovered late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Not fast . " <p> " Give me a number . " <p> " Twenty , maybe twenty-five . " <p> " What was the posted speed ? " <p> " Thirty-five , " Guy guessed . he did n't remember seeing a sign . " We were lost ; it was raining . I was n't speeding . " <p> " Would you say you were driving too fast for conditions ? " <p> " I do n't think so , no . " <p> " But you could n't stop . " <p> " The kid ran in front of the car-he must have tripped or something ; he seemed to just vault up over the hood . " <p> " Before the impact ? " <p> Guy hesitated . <p> " Did he hit you , or did you hit him ? " <p> The scene was so vivid : How could he not be sure ? " We hit him . " <p> " Did you see him before you hit him ? " <p> " Yes . " he would never forget it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shock . <p> " But you could n't stop . " <p> " No . " <p> " Why 's that ? " <p> Guy resisted an impulse to grind his teeth . " I told you-he ran right in front of the car . " <p> " I thought he was airborne . " <p> There was a cigarette butt floating in a half-empty Styrofoam cup . It was disgusting , but for the first time in the eight years since he 'd quit , Guy wished he had a cigarette . " He was running , and he tripped . " <p> " Were his feet on the ground when you hit him ? " <p> " I 'm not sure . " <p> " So you saw him only a moment before the impact . " <p> " That 's right . " He was beginning to sweat , though his clothes were still damp and he felt chilled . <p> " Why was that ? " <p> " I 'm not sure I understand the question . " <p> " Was it because of the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision ? " <p> Had he turned his head when he spoke to Eva ? But he had seen the boy , had seen him frozen in the headlights , he was sure . Guy shifted in his seat , and the chair 's metal cleat caught a loop of the stained nylon carpet . " He must have been behind something . " <p> " What ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " A building ? A car ? " <p> " No . " His head had begun to hurt , but the pain felt old , as if it had been there a long time and he 'd just worn through to it . " I could n't see what it was , but I know it was n't a car . Brush , " he decided , but when he replayed the scene , the vegetation was only an impenetrable darkness . <p> " You 're sure . " There was something distracting about McThune 's mouth . A narrow scar split his upper lip , a seam so fine Guy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Years ago McThune might have guarded him in a pick-up game of basketball . He thought he remembered the mouth twisted by a taunt , habitual defense of the shorter player , and then the moment when he pivoted with the rebound as the guard moved in too close and the mouth connected with his elbow . An accident . <p> He tried again . " I do n't know . It was dark , and I was unfamiliar with the street . Maybe he was just wearing dark clothes . " How often in his own neighborhood had a dark-clad jogger suddenly loomed in his headlights ? he could n't picture what the boy had been wearing , though he was certain that fifteen minutes ago he had known every detail of the boy 's appearance , known it as vividly as one knows a dream that is irretrievably lost the instant the dreamer attempts to fit its images to words . Though he was telling the truth , he felt tangled in lies . It had happened too fast to process . He could n't separate the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ran out ; he could n't stop , and the reason he could n't was that no one could have . <p> McThune was tapping his pen . Guy saw the narrow , almost feminine fingers on the ball . Definitely they had played . " OK , you saw him a moment before you hit him . Did you brake ? " <p> " Of course . " Yes was the right answer ; of course sounded snide . Look , he wanted to say , I understand you 're just doing your job , but do n't you think the only decent thing for us to do right now is get over to the hospital and find out what 's happened to that boy ? It pissed him off to have his grief poisoned by paranoia ; and it pissed him off to be pissed off . His animosity toward cops was part of a larger aversion for authority , and though there was n't a thing he could have done to save his job when the paper was sold , he knew that Eva would never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Did you skid ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Before or after you hit the boy ? " <p> He was n't sure . <p> " The pavement was wet ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Was it raining ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " You 're sure you saw the victim . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " But you could n't stop . " <p> " That 's right . " <p> " Maybe the rain kept you from seeing him sooner . " <p> " Maybe . " That was it . There was no obstruction ; it was raining , and the kid had on dark clothes . <p> McThune made a note . " How fast were you going at the moment of impact ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " But before you braked you were going twenty-five . " <p> " Or twenty . I do n't think I was going more than twenty . " <p> " The pavement was wet , you were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skidded . " <p> " That 's right . " The questions were no longer worded as questions , but as traps he had set for himself . <p> " You did n't brake sooner because the rain kept you from seeing the victim . " <p> " Yes . " <p> McThune slapped his notebook shut and stood . " You were unfamiliar with the street . It was raining , it was dark , visibility was impaired . Now I 've been following what you said very carefully , and it sounds to me like you 're telling me you were driving too fast for conditions . " <p> Guy felt more resigned than angry . He was tired , and a blood vessel beat behind his right eye . " In my opinion I was not driving too fast for conditions . " <p> McThune walked to the door and stared into the hall for a moment before he turned . " Mr. Ferrin , you hit a child . Believe me , you were driving too fast for conditions . " He resumed his seat , softening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By your own admission you 'd been drinking . We 're talking about an accident with serious bodily injury here .

" I think I want a lawyer . " He should have asked for a lawyer as soon as they reached the station . Eva was the one who thought of things . Why had n't she suggested it ? " I believe it 's my right to refuse to answer questions without counsel . " <p> " I do n't have any more questions at the moment , but you 're welcome to call an attorney . " <p> There was a knock on the door , and another officer stuck his head in . McThune stepped outside . It was a report from the hospital , Guy felt sure , though he was n't at all sure that the police would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wait to spring it on him , catch him off guard . <p> " The kid ? " he asked anyway when McThune opened the door and indicated he was to come out . <p> " Still in ER . " <p> Guy 's breath thickened . He thought of Nick and realized that if anything like this had happened to his son he would n't have cared whose fault it was , he would have killed the guy who did it . <p> Though the public phone was in plain view of the sergeant 's desk , the book had been stolen ; when Eva tipped the apparatus up , only a scrap of paper clung to the rod inside the plastic binder . She would have to call home first . Luckily the officer had reminded her to remove her purse from their car , or she would have had no change . <p> The phone rang a dozen times before Courtney mumbled " Hullo ? " Waiting , Eva forced herself to trace the girl 's steps as she stumbled through the darkened living room toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could no longer contain her alarm . " Oh , Mrs. Ferrin . " <p> " I 'm sorry we 're late . " Eva explained about the accident , asked after Nick , and obtained her mother 's number , which she wrote on the back of her hand . Her knees and hands were scraped . Somehow she had lost her shoes . <p> Mrs. Wood answered on the first ring . <p> " Hello , this is Eva Summer , Nick Ferrin 's mother ? Courtney is babysitting for us tonight ? " Hysteria bubbled up in Eva 's throat . " I know you must be worried . It 's so late . There 's been an accident . " <p> " Accident ? " Mrs. Wood 's voice jumped . <p> " Courtney 's fine , " Eva promised . " She was n't with us . " <p> " I 've been so worried . " Relief surged through the wires . <p> " I know , and I 'm very sorry , but I 'm afraid we 're going to be a while longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , and it 's unlisted . She 's supposed to leave a number . " <p> " I 'm sorry . " Eva closed her eyes . <p> " It 's pretty late . She 's not allowed to sit past midnight . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Eva said again . " We 'll be home as soon as we can , but right now we 're at the police station . " Her voice quavered . " We hit a little boy . . . . " <p> " I doubt I 'll be able to get her up for church tomorrow . " <p> Well , scratch Courtney from the sitter list , Eva thought bitterly as she hung up . Bitch . She remembered asking her best friend Claudia to recommend a babysitter after Nick was born . They 'd shared secrets for years ; they knew each other 's kitchens as intimately as their own . Yet when Eva asked for the name of a sitter , Claudia changed the subject . That was Eva 's introduction to the List , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let outside the family , no matter how much like sisters best friends were . <p> When she turned around , McThune was standing behind her . " What happened to your shoes ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't know . How is the boy ? " <p> " Still in ER . " <p> He had made it to the hospital . She had been afraid he would die on the way . Now he could n't die . No matter how bad it was , they would save him . " How will they find out who he is ? " <p> " He 's a foreign kid , Montagnard looked like to me . We 'll send an officer to ask around the community , probably the churches and social-service agencies . It wo n't be hard . " <p> Montagnard . They were from somewhere in Vietnam , she thought . The Herald had run a series of articles on them when they first came over . " I was just thinking about his parents . It seemed so horrible out there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything has happened to him . " <p> " It probably was n't as much time as you think . " McThune held a door . <p> Eva paused just inside . " I kept thinking about my own son . " Her eyes dropped to his patent-leather holster as he indicated the chair Guy had occupied . " I just ca n't figure out what he was doing there . It was nothing but warehouses and vacant lots . " <p> " It 's an industrial zone . " He took out a notebook and pen . " Would you like a cup of coffee ? " Eva shook her head . " What were you doing there ? " <p> It was easier not to look at the gun when he sat . " We took the wrong exit from the interstate and got lost . " <p> " What was your destination ? " <p> " Home . We were coming back to Random . " If you 're ever anyplace where anyone has a gun , leave immediately and tell your parents , they had instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should wake him up to remind him as soon as they got home . Once when he was small the couple across the street invited them for a cookout , which the couple spoiled by arguing , one of those tedious evenings when the visitor feels summoned less as a guest than a witness to ongoing misery and dispute . When at last the men went out to tend the grill , and while their children played upstairs , the woman had gone on whining to Eva : Her husband did n't like her family ; he never wanted to go out for dinner ; despite her concern for the safety of their three-year-old son , he kept a hunting rifle in their bedroom closet . Eva never forgave her . Later that night she had knelt before her son . " Jason 's daddy has a gun , " she began , by way of explaining why he would never play at Jason 's house again . " I know , " Nick replied . " Jason showed me . " She was glad when the couple split up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " We went to the opera at Dill Creek . " It had been her idea to go . She 'd ordered the tickets months ago , and Guy had forgotten he 'd agreed . <p> " Who was driving ? " <p> " My husband . " She smoothed the damp silk bunched at her knee . She might as well have been the driver . It had happened to both of them . <p> " Did your husband have anything to drink ? " <p> " We went out to dinner . We had a drink while we were waiting for our table and a glass of wine with the meal . " The room smelled stale , foul with cigarette smoke and the unrepentant breath of hardened felons . <p> McThune studied his notes . " To the best of your knowledge , then , your husband had one glass of wine with dinner and one drink before , is that correct ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " What time did you eat ? " <p> " A little after seven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either you or your husband have anything to drink after dinner ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Did your husband leave your presence at any time between dinner and the accident ? Did he go to the men 's room , say ? " <p> " Once , but . . . " <p> " Let 's come back to the accident . How fast were you traveling ? " <p> Eva 's face felt stiff . " My husband did not have a drink when he went to the bathroom . " As McThune looked up , his features swam inside a corona . She no longer wore her contact lenses full-time , and they burned her eyes . " If he had , your machine would have registered it . " <p> " The BAG has been noted . " He returned his attention to his notebook . " How fast was your vehicle traveling ? " <p> " Not very . " Her voice was cool , though she supposed she should forgive him . He was doing his job ; if he had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give me a number . " <p> She shook her head . " I 'm not good with estimates . " <p> " Try . " <p> " Fifteen maybe ? " <p> " Your husband says twenty . " <p> " It could have been twenty . It was below the speed limit , I 'm sure . " Eva wished she could ask how Guy was holding up , but McThune was still writing . <p> " Did you see the child ? " <p> " I think so , just before we hit him , yes . " <p> " What happened ? " <p> She had reminded Guy that he was lost . Do you want to drive , he 'd snapped . <p> " I do n't know . I turned my head , and when I turned it back he was already there . It was like he flew off a bicycle or something . " <p> " Did you see a bicycle ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Was he running ? Did he look frightened , like he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't see his face until we hit him . " It was Guy 's face Eva saw , and the expression was n't irritation but shock . They had been on the edge of a quarrel , and she 'd thought he was irked . He was irked . A shiver slipped down her spine . " He looked surprised . " She wiped at her eyes . " When ... ? " <p> " We 've got an officer at the hospital who 'll keep us advised if there 's any change in the victim 's condition . " McThune looked at her , not unkindly . " You 'd be surprised , even twenty miles an hour . It does n't take much . Especially kids-they take the trauma lower ; there 's usually more vital organs involved . Was the victim airborne when you hit him ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Were his feet on the ground ? " He was writing . <p> " I 'm sorry . It just happened so fast . I turned my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mad . It 's not a good side of town . . . . " She stopped , appalled . It was the black side of town . Not until that moment had she realized he was black . <p> " Did you hit him , or did he hit you ? " <p> " He hit us , " she answered , surprised . She had n't been able to frame it that way for herself , but as soon as he said it she knew that was what had happened . <p> " Your husband says that you hit him . " <p> " No . " She shook her head . <p> Did your husband see the boy ? " <p> " I 'm sure he did . " <p> " Did he say anything that would indicate he saw him ? " <p> " No , but . . . " <p> " Did he brake ? " <p> " Yes . He had this look . " <p> " What look was that ? " <p> She had asked him where they were going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skid ? " <p> " Maybe . " Tears sprang to her eyes . How could anything that happened so fast happen so irrevocably ? <p> " Take your time , " he offered . She tightened her lips and gave him a pinched nod . He softened his voice . " Can you tell me what happened after you hit the boy ? " <p> " There was a big thump , and the car jerked . I saw him fly up over the hood . " <p> " And then ? " <p> " We stopped and looked for him . My husband found him . He was behind the car . I do n't know why I was looking in front . " <p> " Once you stopped , did either you or your husband move the car ? " <p> " No . The only thing , I had an umbrella , I went back to get it , and I turned off the lights so the battery would n't run down . " <p> " The ignition was off ? " <p> " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> " What happened when you found the boy ? " <p> " My husband could n't tell if he was alive . He went to look for a phone . I was afraid to move him , so I got the umbrella . " <p> " Is there anything you 've left out ? " <p> " I do n't think so . Just . . . " When she hesitated , he looked up . " . . . that it was n't my husband 's fault . " <p> " OK , Mrs. Ferrin . " He wrote in the notebook . After a few minutes he passed her a sheet of paper . " Read that over , and if you feel it 's accurate I 'd like you to sign it . " <p> She found her reading glasses in her bag , then picked up the pen . <p> " It 's fine . Only my name 's not Ferrin , it 's Summer . " <p> He looked at her the way the receptionist at the orthopedist 's office had when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine who will be responsible for the bill , " the receptionist had said . It was 1990 , and she acted as if she 'd never heard of a husband and wife with different names before . " Summer is your maiden name ? " McThune asked . <p> " My first husband 's name . " She flushed , annoyed to find herself explaining , as if she 'd revealed that she and Guy were not the irreproachable middle-class couple they pretended to be . " I was using it professionally before I met Guy . " <p> " What do you do ? " <p> " I 'm the curator of the Gardell College Gallery . " A year ago her job had been reclassified from an administrative position to faculty , and now all of a sudden she would need a book in order to be tenured . Never mind that she had run the gallery for fifteen years . But it was n't just the matter of tenure ; her aesthetic was no longer current . They were middle-aged ; they were neither one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed her his card . " OK , Mrs. Ferrin . If you think of anything else , give me a call . " <p> " We 're free to go , then ? " <p> " You are . " <p> " What do you mean ? " She followed him down the hall to an office where Guy slumped in a chair . McThune removed a pair of handcuffs from the drawer . <p> " You 're under arrest for driving while impaired . " For a moment the air went still . Eva 's vision reeled , the top of her scalp seemed to lift , and all the oxygen drained from the room . " You have the right to remain silent . " <p> Her throat closed . She swallowed a breath so big it tore her chest , and the words fell out . " You do n't understand . We feel terrible about what happened , but . . . " <p> " Eva . " Guy 's voice was weary ; pouches of exhaustion sagged beneath his eyes . He lurched to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'll call a lawyer , " she promised and turned on her heel . When Guy had been fingerprinted and photographed , she met them at the magistrate 's office . " Bond is set for five hundred dollars , " the magistrate announced , but as they were on their way out , another officer came in and whispered to McThune . <p> McThune turned to the magistrate . " We have a confirmed death . " <p> Eva put her hands to her face and began to cry . Guy stood stiffly , waiting for whatever came next . <p> " Charge is upgraded to felony death by motor vehicle , " McThune announced , and immediately the magistrate said , " Mr. Ferrin , you 've been charged with felony death by motor vehicle . Bond for five hundred is revoked ; I order that you be held on a new bond of twenty thousand dollars . Your first appearance will be in district court at 9 A.M. , Monday , November 18 . Hearing for probable cause is scheduled for 9 A.M. , Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bondsman and a lawyer , " Eva promised as McThune led Guy from the room . " It was n't your fault , " she called . <p> McThune turned around . Later she could not be sure whether the voice she heard was his or the one inside her head : " Lady , when you hit a kid , it 's always your fault . " <p> Author Affiliation
