<p> The holidays are over , and everyone 's minding their 2 's and 0 's . Let 's be honest , no matter our intentions , we succumbed to one too many servings of stuffing and pie , and a few too many glasses of holiday cheer . Now , despite our New Year 's resolutions , feelings of deprivation loom large as we contemplate doing without . How , in the long , dark month of January , are we to get back on track ? <p> " The consequences of overindulging can be reversed , " Dr. Deborah Friedson Chud , author of The Gourmet Prescription : High Flavor Recipes for Lower Carbohydrate Diets ( Bay Books , $ 27.95 ) reassures us . <p> " You have n't blown it for life just because you gained 10 pounds during the holidays . But it 's a mistake to think that in two weeks you can transform yourself physically . You can transform yourself mentally . " <p> For Chud , the path to health and weight-loss salvation lies along the low-carbohydrate road . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent Time magazine cover story on the subject  --  use control of the body 's insulin production as a weight loss strategy . When carbohydrates  --  grains , fruits and vegetables  --  are broken down into sugars , they stimulate the pancreas to produce the hormone insulin , which allows muscle cells to use the sugars for energy . <p> Unused sugars are stored as fat . As Chud explained by phone from her home near Boston , " Eating too much carbohydrate produces too much insulin , which leads to more fat storage , more hunger ( what we experience when our blood sugar drops ) and more carbohydrate craving . <p> " These diets all work by the same three principles , " she continued . " They cut back total carbohydrates , allowing the body to burn stored fats ; emphasize carbohydrates that do n't spike blood sugar and insulin levels ( having a low glycemic index such as most fruits , legumes and high-fiber vegetables ) ; and they balance the hormonal effects of carbohydrates with protein and fats . You could actually eat from several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight . " <p> Chud favors the moderate Zone diet that limits saturated fats and calories , and features " good " carbohydrates . What this boils down to is eliminating pasta , potatoes , white rice , white breads and sugar from one 's diet , and replacing them with low-fat protein , veggies , fresh fruits and whole grains and fructose in small amounts . <p> Chud used to cook high-carbohydrate meals , but when she realized the starch or grain was n't " the flavor-bearing component , " and when she felt good and lost weight , it was n't hard to make the switch . This is where The Gourmet Prescription comes in . <p> An admittedly adult cookbook with a sprinkling of family-pleasers , it 's meant to be a sophisticated companion to high-protein , lower-carbohydrate diet books that makes long-term commitment possible without sacrificing flavor or enduring the rigors of extreme diets . The book makes good on its title ; it 's full of au courant Asian influences , chic condiments such as truffle oil and infused vinegars ( but no high-carb wine ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It never strays from its goal : avoiding food boredom . <p> " I 'm about flavor as much as health , " said the energetic nutrition specialist . Indeed , she often calls for generous salting , unusual in diet recipes , a pharmacopeia of seasonings , both purchased and homemade , and a good dose of garlic . <p> Because " fat is a flavor intensifier " and so satisfying , Chud prescribes a judicious use of unsaturated fats . Her favorite method of " flavor enhancing " is stovetop smoking : " It 's like having a whole new cabinet of spices . " <p> She 's got three $ 50 stovetop smokers at home that she keeps going all weekend to pre-smoke the vegetables that show up frequently in her recipes . The technique requires no added fat and , especially with shallots , garlic and onions , gives the illusion of smoky ham hocks or bacon . <p> " People want recipes that are not fussy but full of flavor , especially after the stress of the holidays , " said Chud . " They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommends recipes in pairs  --  a protein dish and a carbohydrate  --  which is how she wants us to think about meal planning , and how The Gourmet Prescription is organized . <p> The book has just three sections , Condiments and Flavor Enhancers , Protein Dishes and Carbohydrate Dishes ( with a very brief subheading on fruit and fruit desserts ) . <p> Combinations such as grilled lamb chops with smoky piperade served with cannellini beans with rosemary ; five-spice flank steak with hot stir-fried green beans , and roast chicken with rosemary-garlic paste with roasted garlic asparagus keep meals interesting . Many of the sauces and dressings can be made ahead . Even easier , choose one of Chud 's recipes and fill in with a simple grilled meat or salad . <p> Once I swallowed the technical jargon at the beginning of the book , I first gravitated to familiar-sounding recipes , which helped me figure out how my own cooking could fit into the lower-carbohydrate format . Chicken with rosemary-garlic paste was moist and flavorful ; skillet cherry tomatoes , fast and fabulous , and the garlic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-fat mayonnaise and roasted garlic paste to give a rich texture and taste to " diet " dressing . <p> Branching out , I made simple julienned , salted and baked turnip fries that were a big hit . Using only 2 teaspoons of oil , the turnips had a pleasing " french fry " glisten and potato-y texture . But the ingredient list called for 5 cups of turnips . How much to buy ? ( This happens with several recipes . ) I guessed at two large turnips , about 1 1/4 pounds , and came pretty close . ( Note : the 5 cups cooked down to 2 . ) <p> I also looked for recipes that gave me the bottom line . How easily could I get a flavor-packed , healthful meal on the table ? Hot sesame green beans , whole beans tossed with toasted and hot sesame oils and roasted quickly at high heat , took only a moment to prepare , assuming I had the two oils in my pantry . ( I confess : I had to substitute chili pepper flakes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavorful and quick , as long as I marinated it the night before . Although Chud works hard to expand the reader 's pantry , I wish there were more recipes that could be made on the spur of the moment or that she would offer acceptable substitutes more often . But when it comes to company cooking , beautifully photographed dishes such as porcini-laced veal roast and artichokes alla Romana seem worth the effort . <p> If the lower carb route is for you and you do n't have to watch your salt intake , perhaps January wo n't seem so bleak after all . <p> Here are three recipes adapted from Chud 's book . <p> Smoked shrimp ' fajitas ' <p> MAKES 4 SERVINGS <p> Vegetables : <p> 1 tablespoon roasted pepper oil or extra virgin olive oil <p> 1 tablespoon minced garlic <p> 1 cup thinly sliced onion <p> 3/4 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper <p> 3/4 cup thinly sliced green or yellow bell pepper <p> 1 cup drained , canned diced tomatoes <p> 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice <p> Salt , freshly ground black pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or chile powder ) <p> 1/2 teaspoon paprika <p> 1/4 teaspoon Mexican oregano ( or oregano ) <p> 1/4 teaspoon fructose <p> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt <p> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white or black pepper <p> 1 pound extra-large shrimp , peeled and deveined <p> 1 to 2 heads Boston lettuce , leaves separated <p> 4 ounces shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese <p> 1 .
