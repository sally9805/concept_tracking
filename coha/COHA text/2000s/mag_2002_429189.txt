After eighteen seasons in the NBA , JOHN STOCKTON is still a sorcerer , as baffling to his opponents on the court as he is to his fans off it // I 'VE SEEN HIM once in public . It was in a hotel lobby downtown , middle of the day . There were a lot of people standing around , shoulder to shoulder , and , suddenly , there was John Stockton walking toward me , smiling as if he knew me . I was stunned , and he quickly realized his mistake . His face turned to stone , and he was gone . It was like seeing a lynx . Just a glimpse , but I saw him . I saw his eyes . He 's lived in Salt Lake City for seventeen years now , and all we really know about him is what we see on the court . He rarely appears in public , and he shuns the media with a passion . We know that he grewup and went to college in Spokane and that he goes back there every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just the place where he works as a point guard in the NBA . This hurts us , but we accept it He does n't want to be famous . Fine . We know he has a wife and six kids , but they 're off-limits to reporters . You want to piss Stockton off , try talking to his wife . You want trouble , try talking to his kids . We know the neighborhood where they live , but it would be very difficult to find someone who could , or would , tell you which street they live on , let alone which house . There 's a story we 've all heard about a Boy Scout who went to Stockton 's house once , selling lightbulbs . Stockton told him to beat it and never come back or he 'd call the cops . I 've also heard he told the Boy Scout to beat it and never come back or he 'd kill him . Probably neither story is true , but that does n't mean we do n't believe them . All we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a man , not particularly tall or muscular or fast , thirty-nine years old , pale-white skin , short shorts . His hands are large , but other than that , there 's nothing about him that would lead you to believe he is the NBA 's all-time leader in assists and steals . Unless you look at his eyes . Those hazel , kaleidoscopic eyes . I saw them in the hotel lobby . They 're his secret weapon . They allow him to see into the future . It 's strange , but Dennis Rodman also had this ability , in that he always just seemed to know where the ball would come off the rim for a rebound . They 're polar opposites in their personalities , of course ; Rodman was all flash and filigree , and Stockton is as reclusive as a badger . But perhaps both personalities are strategies for protecting their sources of power . Rodman wore feather boas and dyed his hair as a way of hiding his secret weapon , which was his solar plexus , astral lines flying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media eye because this would expose his own eyes to the world and sap his power . Perhaps both men are sorcerers , tapping into the mystery from opposite angles . BANG ! The metal door to the steps leading down into the catacombs of the Delta Center slams open , and two little girls burst through , laughing wildly , as if being chased , as if they 've never had more fun in their lives . One of the girls is Stockton 's daughter , maybe five years old , wearing a Highland-lassie outfit , complete with beret . Close behind is a teenage boy wearing a Jazz staff T-shirt  --  the baby-sitter-looking confused . He ca n't not follow them , but following only makes them run faster . I pass by and walk down a concrete corridor and find the entrance to the arena . Tonight the Jazz will play the SuperSonics , and I have a seat in the press box , just off the floor at midcourt . I 've arrived early , and the arena , like the inside of a seashell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , full court . Two are Stockton 's sons . The game is fast and open , with a lot of long passes . One son leaps for a finger roll ; the other buries a shot from the three-point line . It 's the way they smile , Stockton 's kids , the way they smile as they run by ; you know they 're wild in the best sense of the word . Fifteen minutes before tip-off and the fans are filling up the seats . The players are out on the floor , shooting around and running drills , and balls are flying up to the basket from all directions , chopping through the net . The music is up just loud enough that it pounds your chest , pounds everybody 's chest-all ten thousand , eleven thousand , twelve thousand fans . The shell is pulsating , coming to life . Olden Polynice is on the floor getting his legs stretched by a trainer , Stockton is throwing sidearm bullet passes at players who 'd better be looking , better be paying attention , and John Starks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players , around the court . Circles . Dervishes . Stockton stands still at center court . His face shows no emotion . The referee is talking to the captains . Stockton is listening , or maybe he 's not ; it 's hard to tell . It 's as if he 's not even there at all , or it 's as if he 's the only one there at all . The players shake hands , and Stockton walks away . Karl Malone stays and talks , shooting the shit-How you guys doing ? " But Stockton is already back in his chair on the bench , head down , alone , entering the next dimension . Next , he 's on the court waiting for the tip , eyes darting , balancing on his toes , jerking a bit . When he looks at the other players , he sees not bodies but limbic systems and rays of energy shooting in between , sparking , humming . The fans roar in anticipation , and the rays turn colors , swirling and crackling . Jerk , balance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's alive ! The center of the universe , the creator and destroyer , the bouncing Siva . Stockton runs and throws the ball without looking , throws it into the void , and the mystery unfolds . Stockton may not see it this way at all . It 's how I see it , how I 've watched John Stockton over the years . There have been mornings-gray , inverted winter mornings-when Salt Lake City has felt like an ulcer on the skin of the earth , slowly festering in its own exhaust , and there 's been no hope for humanity other than that the Jazz are playing and winning and might go all the way this year . Stockton , for me , is a mystical presence who lives among us , a true saint who performs miracles . Or maybe it 's wrong to call him a saint . Maybe he 's more like our patron superhero . I think of him as my friend even though I saw him just that once . I 'm somewhat upset by the way he wo n't talk about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , unknowable , but I also think I understand it : If he speaks of his love of the game , it might go away . I want him to open up , but I also want him to stay mysterious , as this gives him more power , or , rather , it gives me more power for my own projections . IT 'S THE SECOND QUARTER , and Stockton is on the bench . He is old and needs to rest . Malone is also old , as is their coach , Jerry Sloan . They had their shot at a title , a period of five or six years when they were serious contenders , but it 's over now . They 're remnants of an era gone by . In the nine minutes that Stockton has sat out , the Jazz have gone down by twelve points . The team comes apart when he is n't playing : Malone does n't seem so fast and strong ; the others run patterns that make no sense . When Sloan puts him back in with nine minutes left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension on both sides , as if a gun has just been cocked . Stockton gets an inbound pass and takes the ball down the floor for a running layup . Then he steals the ball and hits another layup . He 's all over Gary Payton like a chipmunk on acid , and Payton misses his shot . The ball is inbounded to Stockton , who 's already running down the court , and then everybody is running down the court , trying to get back . The players and the fans see what 's coming ; we all see into the future . Everyone knows the ball will leave Stockton 's hand and that a space will open up around it , legs and arms moving miraculously out of the way , and that it will land in Malone 's outstretched palm , one step from the basket . And it happens ! Hot Rod Hundley , the voice of the Jazz , screams , " Flying hammer dunk , the Mailman delivers ! " The fans are out of their minds , jumping and shaking their fists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the shell explodes . Karl Malone has his big arms up in the air , beckoning the heavens as if he were in a painting in the Book of Mormon , lightning arcing between his fists . This is not about basketball ; this is about Good conquering Evil . This is about crushing our enemies . Woe to those who oppose us . Woe , for we will crush them ! Stockton will have none of this . He 's backpedaling , looking everywhere , barking orders : " Play ball ! Play ball ! " The Jazz are down by five . Stockton laces a bounce pass through two sets of legs . He throws a pass football-style , the length of the court . Time out . The Sonics are on their heels , confused . They know they have to keep Stockton from getting the ball , so they put Desmond Mason on him , a forward with a four-inch height advantage . Stockton immediately puts his hand on Mason 's solar plexus . Mason pushes it away , like , " Get that shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits a three-pointer . The Jazz are down by two . Eight seconds left in the half and the score is tied . Stockton has the ball , but no one is open . Five seconds and he waits . He 's looking , seeing everything . His hands want to throw the ball , but his eyes wo n't let him . Everyone 's stuck . Four seconds , three seconds , and Stockton shoots it from three feet behind the three-point line . Buries it . The place explodes . Hot Rod is yelling , " With a gentle push and a mild arc , the cowhide globe hits home ! John Stockton ! John Stockton ! " He 's shouting the name as if it were the words of greatness itself . There is power in the shell . Power in Salt Lake City ! The best teams in the world have come here from New York , Chicago , and Los Angeles only to have their asses kicked by the Utah Jazz . This kind of thing never happened before in Salt Lake City . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAME IS OVER . The Jazz have won . The reporters are in the locker room , or rather the made-for-TV locker room , waiting for the players to emerge from the real locker room for interviews . Stockton comes out fully clothed except for a golf jacket he hangs in his fake locker . I stand next to him . We are the same height and weight . He is five years younger . He looks like an average guy , but this is just his persona , a mask . A reporter asks , " How did it feel to hit that three-pointer at the half ? " " Well , " he says , " I had a good look at the basket , and luckily it went in . Sometimes it does n't . " He 's playing the role , Average Guy , and his eyes are quiet , green neon . All the reporters want to say , " Hey , come on , we saw you play tonight , and you are not normal , " but nobody does . It 's against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like to play when he 's almost forty . " You do n't think about that , " he says . " You think about this play , this quarter , this game . You try to make it easy . " That 's it Silence . Stockton looks around , giving an opening . He looks at me . Anything ? I shake my head . of course not . What is there to ask ? And then he 's gone . I grab my coat and run , and he 's out on the court , the stadium empty , with about ten of his family and friends . Stockton stands in the middle of them , holding his girl in his arms , his son pulling on his leg . He says , " Where are we going for dinner ? Can everybody come eat with us ? " But they ignore him . John Stockton is standing in the house that he and Karl Malone built , and his family is ignoring him , and he 's enjoying it , smiling and laughing at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy man . He sets his girl down and peels his son 's arms off his leg and walks over to his wife , Nada , who 's sitting kind of slumped in his chair on the bench . She looks at him with a coy smile , and he holds out his hand and pulls her up . He hugs her and kisses her on the lips and then turns and says , " Come on , everybody . Let 's go eat at the Pagoda . " And they all go , walking off the court and leaving the Delta Center , which is now an empty shell again . // " Some hunters like a challenge , Stan-but not me ! " // <p>
