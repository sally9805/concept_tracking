LOS ANGELES  --  There 's reason for concern for the state of skate , at least for the U.S. women less than a year from the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver . The results at the world figure skating championships , which begin today at Staples Center , will determine how many skaters a country can send to Vancouver . <p> The USA is counting on 21-year-old Alissa Czisny , the current national champ ranked No. 16 in the world , to overcome her jitters and 16-year-old Rachael Flatt , ranked No. 10 , to shine in her first world championships . Both will have to finish with a combined placement of 13 or better ( for example , fifth and eighth ) to secure the usual three spots in the Olympics . Only once since 1924 has the U.S. sent only two women to the Olympics  --  in 1994 with Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding . <p> " It 's going to be difficult , but I definitely think it 's a reasonable goal , " says Flatt , the 2008 world junior champion . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two world championships after 12 consecutive years of winning at least one medal . As a result , the question looms : Could 2010 be the first Olympics in four decades in which the USA does n't win a medal in women 's figure skating ? <p> There have been four Winter Olympics in history in which a U.S. woman has not been on the podium , the last in 1964 , three years after all of the members of the U.S. figure skating team died in a plane crash . <p> Still , it 's too early to count the U.S. women out of the marquee event of the Winter Games , coaches and Olympians say , though some wonder if the future might be a bit more promising than the present . <p> " It 's definitely in a transition period right now , " says 1992 Olympic gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi , citing the strong group of young American skaters . " I do n't want to write them off . They still have time . The Olympics is a funny thing . It 's not predictable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially not a year out . " <p> Says Kerrigan , a two-time Olympic medalist : " It would be strange ( to not win an Olympic medal ) . It would be hard to come back from that and sad to see . But it happens at internationals . " <p> Says Frank Carroll , who coached Michelle Kwan and now works with Evan Lysacek : " We have very promising skaters coming up . I do n't know if they 're going to be ready for this coming Olympics . I think our better shot at it is the next one . " <p> The world got better <p> At the same time , there is plenty of optimism for the U.S. men and the ice dancers heading into worlds . The men 's field is wide open because of the retirements of last year 's winner Jeffrey Buttle of Canada and two-time world champion Stephane Lambiel of Switzerland . Jeremy Abbott , the U.S. champ ranked third in the world , and two-time world bronze medalist Lysacek could end up on the podium . All disciplines ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two skaters finish with a combined placement of 13 or less to earn three Olympic spots . <p> The 2006 Olympic silver medalists in dance , Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto , return to the ice after missing nationals because of Agosto 's back injury . Meryl Davis and Charlie White , who won gold last month in the Four Continents Championships , also are contenders . <p> So why the decline for the U.S. women ? The void after the departure of nine-time national champ Kwan in 2006 , the growth of the sport in Asia ( Mao Asada of Japan and Kim Yu-Na of South Korea are the favorites for the gold this week ) , and the judging system introduced in 2004 that emphasizes technical aspects and jumps at the expense of beauty and artistry are the reasons cited by skating experts . <p> " Everything is cyclical , " 1984 Olympic champion Scott Hamilton says . " It 's not like America got worse . A lot of countries got really good . Kim , hello ? When was the last time a Korean was dominating women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all watched Midori Ito ( in the 1990s ) become a phenomenal champion . <p> " Someone will ignite that interest in the United States . Maybe the back side of Michelle ( Kwan 's ) dominance is that a lot of kids started skating and we 're going to see that in a few years . It will all work out . " <p> There have been five different U.S. women 's champions the last five years , which certainly does n't help promote and generate more interest in a sport that had been struggling even before the economic downturn . At the U.S. championships in January , NBC 's 3.0 rating for the women 's free skate on a Saturday night was off 21% from last year . It was worse for the men 's free skate Sunday afternoon , as the 2.3 rating was down 34% from 2008 . <p> Without an ice princess emerging as the face of U.S. figure skating , the revolving door of champs has even failed to hold the interest of some of the girls they should be inspiring . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showed about 20 girls whom she trains in Fairfax , Va. , a picture of the young woman who won the 2008 U.S. title . Then she asked them to name the champion . <p> Their guess : Sasha Cohen ? Nope . The last time Cohen competed was in 2006 . Yamaguchi ? Yamaguchi 's final trip to the U.S. championships was in 1992 , but she came to mind because of her recent run on Dancing With the Stars . Not one girl knew the 2008 champ was then 14-year-old Mirai Nagasu , whose U.S. reign ended two months ago at nationals when she crashed into the boards during her short program and left the ice in tears . <p> Gymnastics on ice <p> The late Carlo Fassi , who coached four Olympic gold medalists , predicted 20 years ago that skating would become gymnastics on ice when compulsory figures were eliminated . Then when the International Skating Union ditched the traditional 6.0 scoring system and adopted a complicated , computer-based version , Fassi 's prediction was fully realized . <p> There is no shortage of hand-wringing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , distressing situation , " says Dick Button , the 1948 and ' 52 Olympic gold medalist and the legendary voice of his sport . " I find the fun of skating , the joy of skating and the theatricality of skating has been dissipated . The icons have gone away . The incessant amount of counting of moves . Michelle Kwan 's spiral ? Forget it today . It does n't get points . It held too long . " <p> Teenagers who can hit their triples and young women with certain body types who can continue to nail their jumps as they mature have thrived . The top four finishers among the junior girls in the recent U.S. championships were all of Asian descent . Weisiger , a former U.S. national-level skater of Chinese descent , says , " This sport is attracting people who can succeed in it , who have the ability to jump high and rotate fast , and in order to do that it 's not even a weight issue . We 're skinny , sorry . " <p> Kimmie Meissner won the 2006 worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and injuries . " You have these teeny-weeny girls who are hitting tricks until they become adults , and then when they 're adults they ca n't do the tricks and everyone wants to know what 's wrong , " Weisiger says . " Actually it 's just the maturation process . " <p> Some former skaters think younger champions lessen the average fan 's interest in the sport . " When you had all these women in the sport , Katarina Witt , etc. , it got more attention , " Kerrigan says . " People were interested to see a woman out there . We certainly got a lot more interest from guys than previously . When you have young girls , you lose that because you say , ' I 'm looking at 15-year-old girls , and that 's creepy . There 's something wrong . " <p> Czisny , who is completing her degree at Bowling Green , won the U.S. title in January , reversing the trend of crowning younger and younger champions . Could there still be room for grace and beauty in the sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the oldest first-time champion since Kerrigan won in 1993 at 23 . Still , she landed only three triple jumps in her free skate , leading many to question whether she can compete technically with the world 's elite . Consider that Flatt hit six triples in her program , which is more the customary number . <p> Brian Boitano , the 1988 Olympic gold medalist who now is one of Czisny 's coaches , says her elegance and maturity can help the sport immensely . <p> Czisny 's journey has been one of perseverance . Eight years ago , she finished second as a junior at nationals . Then she struggled as a senior until a breakthrough third-place finish in the 2007 U.S. championships . She was ninth last year . <p> " A woman who has been through a lot , people can relate to her more , " Boitano says . " They know what she 's been through ; she 's been up , down . " <p> Which also is precisely the problem as Czisny heads into worlds . Throughout her career , Czisny has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her jumps when nerves got the best of her . She followed her breakout performance in this year 's nationals with ninth place in the Four Continents . <p> This week , there 's the added pressure of securing three spots at next year 's Olympics . " It 's something we 've almost always had , " she says . <p> Contributing : Vicki Michaelis <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
