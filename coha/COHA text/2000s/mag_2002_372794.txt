LITTLE BIG SHOT Are you a sucker for multipurpose gadgets ? Try this one on for size . It 's a four-in-one digital camcorder , camera , M player and voice recorder from Panasonic . The SV-AV10 ( $449 ) can store 30 min. of MPEG-4 video or 880 digital stills on a single 64-MB memory card and display them on a 2-in. flip-out LCD screen . The whole thing is not much bigger than a deck of cards . <P> FINGER FREE If you are serious about keeping your computer files safe , the Targus Defcon Authenticator ( $120 ) may be for you . It 's a biometric security device that scans your finger ( you choose which one ) , memorizes your fingerprint and locks out all impostors . <P> PHONE FUN Pictures in the wallet are so 20th century . The new , cool way to carry snapshots of your dog or your daughters is in  --  what else ?  --  your cell phone . Attach the Sony Ericsson T68i phone ( $300 to $400 , available this summer ) to a special snap-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 200 digital images . You can even beam pictures to other T68i phones or e-mail them to a PC . With so much to look at , who has time to talk ? <P>  --  By Roy B. White
