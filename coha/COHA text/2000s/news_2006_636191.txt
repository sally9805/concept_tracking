<p> Little fanfare accompanied Ron Magers ' arrival in Chicago in August 1981 . <p> A small item in Gary Deeb 's column noted that the 36-year-old newsman from KSTP-TV in Minneapolis " soon will pop up on WMAQ Channel 5 , probably as a weekend anchor and weekday reporter . But a lot of observers believe it wo n't be long before he supplants either Linda Yu or Chuck Henry on the Nielsen-hungry 10 p.m. weeknight newscast . " <p> Deeb was right . Within six months , Magers was anchoring the NBC-owned station 's flagship newscast , eventually pairing with Carol Marin to form one of the most solid and respected anchor teams in the country . <p> Although it would take nearly two decades and a jump to another station for Magers to achieve No. 1 ratings at 10 o'clock , discerning viewers much more quickly came to appreciate him as an extraordinarily gifted communicator and a first-class broadcast journalist . <p> Magers ' legendary grace under fire got its most severe test in 1997 when he and Marin resigned from Channel 5 to protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commentator on their newscast . In sacrificing multimillion-dollar contracts over a matter of principle , both Magers and Marin became national role models for ethics and integrity . <p> After 10 months of unemployment ( or " the longest vacation of my life , " as he called it ) , Magers resurfaced fortuitously at ABC-owned WLS-Channel 7 , where anchor icons Floyd Kalber and John Drury were approaching retirement . Emily Barr , the top-rated station 's president and general manager , had worked with Magers years earlier when she was an intern and tape editor at KSTP . <p> Today , Magers is without question Chicago 's premier anchorman ( and , some might argue , the best all-around anchor this market has ever seen ) . With co-anchors Kathy Brock at 10 p.m. and Cheryl Burton at 5 p.m. , he holds a commanding lead in the ratings . <p> He 's equally at ease on radio  --  the medium in which he began in the business as a high school junior at KENE-AM in Toppenish , Wash . His daily appearances on ABC-owned news/talk WLS-AM ( 890 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 've had the privilege of working with Ron at two different stations with 16 years in between , " Barr said . " He has always been the consummate professional  --  calm under pressure , incredibly knowledgeable and totally grounded . But it is his ability to communicate with just the right mix of authority and compassion that really makes him stand out . He 's just great at what he does . " <p> On the eve of his 25th anniversary on Chicago television , Magers , 61 , paused to reflect on his remarkable success , the state of local news and the real reason behind the blowup over Jerry Springer : <p> Q. Wow , 25 years in the market and you 're still at the top . How did you do it ? <p> A. When I came to NBC in Chicago , Channel 5 was fourth or fifth in the market . While teamed with Carol Marin and Mark Giangreco and a variety of weather persons  --  including Jerry Taft in the early years  --  we became a very competitive and very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ratings . For most of those days we were a very close second and very proud of our product . <p> Now I 'm fortunate to be part of a team that is atop the ratings , but it really is a team game . There have been famous examples in this city of individual anchors believing they  --  alone  --  were responsible for a station 's success , but I do n't believe it has ever been true . <p> Q. What 's your favorite part of the job ? <p> A. The times we have to work without a script . Live breaking news or an election . <p> Q. What makes a good television news anchor ? <p> A. Nobody knows what makes a good one . If it could be taught or somehow replicated , every anchor would be a successful one . <p> I think the real job of an anchor is to display the work done by your colleagues in the best possible light on each and every newscast . If you 're trying hard to do that then you 're probably on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of it . <p> Q. How would you assess the current state of television news ? <p> A. We are a fabulous medium for coverage of what is happening right now . From a natural disaster to an inauguration , we do it really well . When news is actually happening , our coverage is the best . In my world , local TV news would be more analytical and less reactive . I would also like to see more beat reporting done on local television , but that would require more staff , and most news organizations  --  newspapers included  --  are not expanding these days . In fact , most are reducing staff . So I 'm grateful that our management has been committed to maintaining staff levels . <p> I think that all of the news business is in an interesting shakeout period . Newspapers and local television news are trying to better understand their audience and the things each medium does well . As the information spectrum broadens , we 're all trying to figure out where we fit and how to maintain our audience levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A. If you mean our local news competitors , I 'm not the best judge of what they do . I rarely watch competing stations . I try to stay focused on what we 're doing , and how we 're doing it . <p> Q. How do you always manage to stay so cool under pressure ? <p> A. I 'm uncomfortable even considering the question because it makes me think about what I do . I really do n't like to try to analyze it . I prefer to just let it happen . I 've never even been comfortable watching tapes or video of myself . <p> I guess I 'd say that I 've always been blessed with some kind of sense or thought process that never worries about the fact we 're being watched by hundreds of thousands of folks at home . I just worry about doing the job , and I very much like what I do . I 've always felt comfortable working in front of a camera , whether it was as a reporter or an anchor . I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Q. You are the No. 1 anchorman in Chicago , and your brother , Paul Magers , is the No. 1 anchorman in Los Angeles at KCBS-TV . Has any family ever dominated two of the top three markets before ? <p> A. I 'm told that we 're the only ones to ever do it . When the history of broadcasting is written , maybe we 'll be a footnote . <p> I 'm very proud of my brother Paul . He 's a bit taller than I , he 's 10 years younger and , in my view , he 's the second-best local television news anchor in the country . <p> Q. How do you view the whole Jerry Springer episode in hindsight ? <p> A. It was heart wrenching at the time . We had worked very hard to put together a first-rate news shop , and I really enjoyed and respected most of my colleagues . It was also scary , because I was trying to walk out on a high-paying contract without any guarantee that any other station would ever hire me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly defy management . <p> In hindsight , I believe it was a colossal confluence of egos  --  or maybe I should say a confluence of colossal egos . We had a new manager , Lyle Banks , who seemed desperate to put his personal stamp on an already successful television station . We had Jerry Springer , who , I believe , was embarrassed about the way he made money in television and wanted to rehabilitate his image . They decided that it might accomplish both of their purposes for Springer to do social commentary on a newscast . Carol Marin and I disagreed , but were basically told that it was going to happen , and we had no vote . So we decided to vote with our feet and take a walk . <p> My memories of that time now include many individual acts of courage by other newsroom personnel who either made their views known to management or , in some cases , left the station . But I 'm still troubled by the acts of a few who either sidestepped the issue to gain favor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all under a great deal of pressure , and previously unknown facets of individual character were clearly revealed . I guess that 's the kindest way I could put it . <p> I am comforted by the fact that , all these years later , I still firmly believe it was the right thing to do . <p> Q. How do you like doing radio  --  and what 's Roe Conn really like ? <p> A. I love doing radio . It is one of the highlights of my day , and Roe makes it very easy . We just sit down and talk about anything and everything . Roe is very smart . He 's also extremely quick-witted and incredibly insightful about broadcasting . <p> Q. What 's with you and horses ? <p> A. I am still involved with thoroughbred horses but on a smaller scale than in previous years . I would hope that I will always own a horse or two , and would always like to own a broodmare or two to produce future prospects . I love the animals and the lifelong friends I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four grandchildren . How has grandfatherhood changed you ? <p> A. I once heard someone say that when you 're young , your life is filled with possibilities . Then , at a much later point , you realize your life is filled with memories . <p> Grandfatherhood found me at a time in life when I 've still got possibilities but I 'm also more aware of the memories and their importance . It reminds me to continue being active and involved in the process of making those memories for me and for them . <p> Q. Who are the favorite people you 've worked with in Chicago ? <p> A. There are dozens and dozens of people whose work I 've admired in all aspects of the business . Among the names you might know , I 'd have to include the late Paul Hogan and Phil Walters . They were , for different reasons , consummate television reporters . Paul Meincke is very much in their mold . Rich Samuels , who 's now at Channel 11 , is the best writer for television I 've ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart , and she is easily the best reporter to ever anchor a local news program . Taft and Giangreco and I go so far back with so much personal history that they 'll always be part of my life . <p> Just think about the people I work with now at ABC 7 . I truly believe that if you broke up our team of anchors and reporters , you could provide the front line people for three major market television stations . <p> Now I 'm sorry I said that . I do n't want to give management any bad ideas . <p> Q. What goes on when the red light goes off ? <p> A. Relief . Sometimes a sense of frustration . Sometimes a sense of accomplishment . <p> On the best days a feeling of sincere pride about the work I 've seen done by the people in our newsroom . <p> Q. How do you think you 'll be remembered 25 years from now ? <p> A. Professionally , I doubt that I will be much remembered . How many people do you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years ? Our business is about the image on the screen at this very moment , and not about the one that used to be there . <p> Now that I think about it , in 25 years I 'll only be in my mid-80s . Maybe you 'll be asking these same questions about my 50th anniversary in Chicago broadcasting . <p> e-mail : feder@suntimes.com Color Photo : Dom Najolia/Sun-Times ; WLS-Channel 7 's Ron Magers , Chicago 's premier anchorman : " I think the real job of an anchor is to display the work done by your colleagues in the best possible light .
