Maybe it really was a lightning attack of back spasms that kept Michael Jackson out of court last week . ( It 's plausible . ) Or maybe he just thought the event thus far had been short on melodrama . ( It had n't . ) But on Thursday , when he finally appeared in Santa Barbara County Superior Court after the judge in his child-molestation case threatened to revoke his $3 million bail , the deposed King of Pop displayed his usual showmanship , even if not his usual sartorial flair . <P> Wearing a dark jacket over blue pajama bottoms , and supported by bodyguards , the 46-year-old moonwalker did a slow , frail moon swoon past the gaggle of reporters . The moment had echoes of the famous James Brown routine , in which the soul man , feigning exhaustion , would be shepherded toward the wings by bandmates , only to break free and sing one more chorus of Please , Please , Please . Jackson 's version was pretty persuasive ... until he heard the encouraging cries of his admirers . Instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body might have been in agony , but his fan radar was as limber as ever . <P> Jackson has treated the trial as an occasion for performance art  --  arriving fashionably late , as if to his own concert , doling out gallery seats to his family and the lingering faithful , some of whom are sleeping over at the Gloved One 's Neverland estate , where the crimes are alleged to have occurred . But he should have been jolted into reality when he listened to last week 's sobering , detailed testimony by the star witness : a boy , 15 , who related a catalog of sexual abuse at the hands of the man he had thought of as " my best friend . " <P> On the witness stand , guided by district attorney Thomas Sneddon , the boy , who is not being named to protect his identity , declared that two years ago , in Jackson 's bedroom , the singer twice molested him . " I was under the covers , and that is when he put his hand down my pants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or two later , " he did it one more time . " He said that Jackson showed him and his younger brother pornography in magazines and on the Internet , and plied them with wine  --  " Jesus juice "  --  in Diet Coke cans . Under stern cross-examination by Jackson lawyer Thomas Mesereau Jr. , who argues that the family 's charges are a scam to elicit money from Jackson , the boy wavered in some particulars but did not break . <P> The accuser and the accused make a poignant pair . Both have attested to physical abuse by their fathers . And both cried out for a gentle touch . Jurors will decide which of the two is to be believed : the one who is a child or the one who thinks he still is . <P> The boy met Jackson in 2000 , when the accuser was 10 and suffering from what was diagnosed as incurable leukemia . Surgeons removed his left kidney and spleen and a 16-lb. tumor . He was given large doses of chemotherapy , which doctors said would either save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . When he asked to meet his hero , Michael Jackson , it was arranged .
