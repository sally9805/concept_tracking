Section : PLUMAGE FROM PEGASUS " Can one be taught to be a book editor or publisher in a few summer weeks ? " <p>  --  Martin Arnold , " Creating Editors and Publishers , " The New York Times , July 1 , 1999 . <p> The Raw recruits filed nervously off the bus that had carried them from New York 's Port Authority to the secluded camp somewhere in the New Jersey Pine Barrens . A motley group of informally dressed males and females , young and old , they each carried the only items they had been allowed and instructed to bring : a Barnes and Noble canvas bookbag held a copy of Strunk and White , an unabridged dictionary , a calculator , a wireless Palm Pilot with stock-market access capability , a box of red-ink pens , a spare pair of reading glasses , a pack of antacid tablets , and an ergonomic chair cushion . <p> The empty bus drove off . Clustering like spooked cattle , the recruits looked around the unpeopled grounds for guidance . But the mute barracks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to proceed . <p> " Maybe this is a test of our initiative , " said one recruit . <p> " No way , " said another . " I 've heard some vague but scary stories from graduates . Our every minute here will be strictly planned and scheduled . There 's no free time or self-direction at all . " <p> " Makes sense , " said a third . " After all , they 've only got a few weeks to shape us into top-of-the-line editors . " <p> " Well , all I know is that for the money they 're charging us , we should have a better reception  --  jug wine and brie at the very least . " <p> A door slammed , and all heads turned toward the sound . A lone figure had emerged from one of the barracks and now strode with macho determination toward them . As the elegantly suited small man drew closer , whispers began to circulate among the recruits . <p> " Is that  --  ? " " No , it could n't be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The man reached a conversational distance and stopped . He superciliously sized up the recruits for a long minute , then spoke in a quiet voice . <p> " Ladies and gentlemen , allow me to introduce myself . My name is Michael Korda . " <p> The huddled men and women visibly relaxed , which was precisely the reaction Korda had been counting on , for he now thrust his face forward aggressively and bellowed . <p> " BUT YOU MAGGOTS CAN CALL ME GOD ! AND GOD 'S ONE GOAL FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS IS TO TURN YOU PUSILLANIMOUS PUS-BUCKETS INTO EDITORS AT LEAST COMPETENT ENOUGH TO SHINE MAXWELL PERKINS 'S SHOES ! WHEN I SAY ' REVISE ! ' , YOU 'RE GON NA SAY ' HOW MANY CHAPTERS , SIR ! ' HAVE I MADE MYSELF CLEAR ? " <p> Several people had fainted . All were trembling . One fellow dared to answer with a meek , " Yuh  --  yes , sir . " <p> " I CA N'T HEAR YOU , WORM ! " <p> " Yes , sir ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands behind his back , he strode up and down surveying his plebes . When he next spoke , his voice was once again quiet and reserved , exhibiting the patrician tones that had smoothed many a profitable publishing deal and soothed many a queasy author . <p> " I 'm glad we have an understanding . Please realize that I bear you no personal animosity . Your histories and characters mean nothing to me , except insofar as they relate to your nascent editorial skills . I do n't care whether you 've graduated from an Ivy League school or a community college . As Tennessee Williams often told me , ' A sweet pot of red beans and rice trumps a lousy plate of lobster fra diavolo every time , sugar-honey . ' You 're all the same raw material in my hands . And since I have very little time in which to mold your impressionable minds , I 've found that terror works best . Consequently , your stay here will be punctuated with frequent unpredictable shocks  --  akin to the hostile buyouts you 'll soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons home . " <p> The brave recruit who had previously responded now dared to ask a question . " Sir , are you the only instructor at the camp ? " <p> " By no means . We 'll have a number of visiting lecturers coming in who will assist me in honing your talents . These men and women range the gamut from editors to publishers to distributors to booksellers , from critics and reviewers to literary agents and Hollywood moguls . Each of these experienced experts will share their immense wisdom and knowledge with you <p> "  --  AND YOU 'LL SUCK IT ALL DOWN LIKE PIGLETS AT THEIR MAMA 'S TEATS AND MAKE IT PART OF YOUR VERY CELLS ! " <p> Once the leaves on the trees had ceased quivering and the sound of shattering window glass had diminished , Korda continued . <p> " Let me particularize just a few of the visiting editors who have graciously consented to enlighten you . <p> " We 'll hear from Bill Bruford of The New Yorker , who 'll instruct us in how to manufacture superstar writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Lecturing us on the niceties of claiming posthumous credit for reconfiguring the stories of deceased authors will be Gordon Lish , who will never let you forget his tenure at Esquire . <p> " Alice Turner of Playboy will explicate the usefulness of cognitive dissonance , concentrating on the juxtaposition of pubic hair to Norman Mailer-magnitude pontifications . <p> " Tina Brown of Talk will advise us about the benefits and pitfalls of Hollywood synergy . <p> " The legendary Edward Ferman has very kindly agreed to interrupt his retirement to help us understand how his legal adoption of the current editor of F &SF; has insured the continuation of the Ferman publishing dynasty . <p> " And Helen Guffey Brown has likewise broken her well-deserved leisure to help us all achieve washboard abs . " <p> Korda paused , then fixed the potential editors with the same adamantine gaze that had once made his opponent James Jones capitulate in an arm-wrestling bout at Elaine 's that had already stretched on for half an hour . Knees wobbled as they awaited his next words . <p> " But on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see regularly . And by regularly I mean IN YOUR FREAKING FACE TWENTY-FOUR-SEVEN ! When you awake at four A.M. for your mock subway commute , I 'll be the annoying fellow straphanger who spills coffee on your irreplaceable manuscript . When you pair off and sit down for a pretend three-hour lunch with your most important author , I 'll be the lousy waiter who ca n't get your orders right . When you 're eagerly awaiting the dummy sales figures on what you expect will be a bestseller , I 'll be the intern who adds or subtracts an extra zero from the numbers . In short , for the next few weeks I 'm going to be both your worst , most hated enemy , and your best , most cherished friend . When I 'm done with you , you will have gone through the same baptism by fire that once took an editorial lifetime . <p> " Now , the first order of business is to get you neophytes into our fully staffed spa and salon for a stylish haircut , followed by a facial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll each be measured for a tailored power suit . An editor always has to look his or her best . AND RIGHT NOW YOU SLOBS LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF PUBLICISTS OR SALES REPS ! After that , you 'll each receive half a dozen 600-page manuscripts which I expect to be line-edited before breakfast . " <p> The recruits made a tentative step or two toward the barracks before being brought up short by Korda 's stentorian assault . <p> " DID I SAY ' DISMISSED ' YET , SLIME ? NOW , HOLD UP ONE OF YOUR RED MARKERS HIGH , GRAB YOUR CROTCHES , AND REPEAT AFTER ME  --  ! " <p> <p> By Paul Di Filippo <p>
