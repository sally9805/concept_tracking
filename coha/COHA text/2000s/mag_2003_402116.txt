As a University of Oklahoma art student in the mid-1970s , Lori Bacigalupi fell in love with batik , the ancient art of coating fabric with wax to create intricate patterns through resist dyeing . She recalls being touched by hearing of an Indonesian belief that the soul of the wearer experiences batik because the design is on both sides of the fabric . More than 25 years later , Bacigalupi is still guided by a reverence for how quality clothing feels on the body . Lori 's designs were born out of this respect for the importance of textiles in indigenous cultures-a passion shared by her late husband , Marshall . The couple 's involvement with color , pattern and clothing design developed informally when they were both students at the university , living on the outskirts of Norman , Oklahoma , and supporting themselves as yoga instructors and making such items as ikat belts and batik scarves , which they would sell at outdoor shows within a 500-mile radius of Norman . They also made garments for weddings held in their home , which was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply strips of cloth woven by Marshall to clothing she designed and sewed . Photograph // Their business , Kiss of the Wolf-its name the translation of Bacigalupi from the Italian - began officially in 1976 when they received a request for colorful wedding clothing they would make with fabric dyed in their kitchen . Thanks to an Oklahoma oil boom in the late 70s , the wearables they created sold well enough to enable them to spend six months in Asia studying batik and weaving techniques , an experience that helped the pair develop their aesthetic . Although their clothing was at first made of cotton , the Bacigalupis soon began working exclusively with several types of Chinese silk . Eventually , they moved into Norman and in 1984 , with the help of friends , they built a large studio behind their home that enabled them to stretch long lengths of fabric for the direct-dye application . Their first American Craft Council Show , at West Springfield , Massachusetts , in 1986 , was a " changing point " in the growth of their business . Though initially inhibited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt they had found a niche and a community . They reasoned , Lori says , that " if we had wonderful stuff there would be a market for it-somebody out there to appreciate it . The shows allowed us to grow . " Marshall 's death from cancer in 1996 was a great personal loss , but in the years since , Lori has sustained Kiss of the Wolf in the spirit with which it was begun . The business operates with a small devoted team , each member contributing in a unique way . Bacigalupi spends much time on the road-in addition to the American Craft Council Shows , she exhibits at the Smithsonian Craft Show and other venues-and brings the ideas generated by travel back to her assistants . She describes this process of working together as a " synthesis of energies . " The energy is palpable in the studio , where experimentation is a vital part of the team 's creative process . A garment begins with the fabric , which is hand-painted with French acid dyes by Shawn Downey , an artist and filmmaker Bacigalupi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sewn and carefully hand-finished by Yan Lan , whose quilting often follows the gentle lines of the fabric 's pattern . Along the way , Bacigalupi " plays " with the design-constantly considering how the garment drapes and moves with the body . Rounding out the team are Ola Molinas , who handles customer relations , and Candy Hewitt , the office manager , who , Bacigalupi claims , is her " left brain . " Most recently Bacigalupi has collaborated with Heather Clark , a local weaver , to create a unique felt made of silk and wool . Amazingly lightweight and supple , the fabric adds a wonderful new texture to the Kiss of the Wolf repertoire . Bacigalupi is particularly excited about this fabric 's associations with Asian nomadic peoples , who have traditionally made tents and yurts from felt . Garments made of the felt , like a charcoal gray wrap with rosette closure , hint at these nomadic origins-with an elegant twist . Kiss of the Wolf clothing is created with active lives in mind . Bacigalupi designs separates that travel well and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve an individual look . The clothing is made to be comfortable and to comfort . Many of the jackets and vests are quilted , which enhances this quality . Indeed , Bacigalupi considers the quilted silk pieces , with their characteristic vintage button , to be the signature of Kiss of the Wolf . There is an organic quality to Bacigalupi 's fabrics and clothing . Subtle curvilinear patterns like those found in nature ripple across many of the silks , markings that contrast with the more angular , often asymmetrical lines of the clothing . Patterns are achieved through various means , including shibori . Colors , some developed with a specific client in mind , are also inspired by the natural world . Bacigalupi is strongly influenced by her surroundings ; many of her characteristic colors-taupe , tobacco , olive , celadon and black-are reminiscent of the Oklahoma landscape . A recent trip to Costa Rica , however , has sparked a desire to add tropical hues to her palette . Less than a week after her return , Bacigalupi and Downey were experimenting with a fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dye application with wax painting . With this endeavor , the designer feels that her creative process has come full circle , reconnecting current work to her early fascination with batik . Bacigalupi 's intense engagement with life has always fueled her design aesthetic . Her ongoing exploration of beauty and culture lends freshness to Kiss of the Wolf designs . She is adventurous and open to new possibilities . Her life 's journey has taken many unexpected twists and turns since she hitchhiked from New York to New Mexico and met Marshall Bacigalupi at age 19 . So it is not surprising that Kiss of the Wolf is poised to enter new territory-the World Wide Web . As fascinated as Bacigalupi is with this technological step and its potential to introduce her designs to a new market , she worries about the viewer 's inability to touch the fabrics . The site , www.kissofthewolf.com , will try to suggest their tactility through comments from Bacigalupi 's loyal clientele . But ultimately the garments must be donned to be fully experienced .
