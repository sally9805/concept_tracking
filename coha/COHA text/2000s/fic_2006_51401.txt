The Sharma family 's trip to Bombay did n't go well . The Royal Nepal Airlines plane started acting funny after half an houra strange sound choked the left wing , and the plane began to hiccup-so they had to land in Patna , where the passengers were forced to stay in a hotel for the night . The mishap would have been tolerable had not twenty-one-year-old Nilesh sauntered out of the hotel after dinner to " check out the territory " and within two minutes get mugged in an alley , where two hoodlums pocketed his wristwatch , his gold necklace , and the twenty thousand rupees Indian currency stashed in the inside pocket of the coat he had on that warm evening . " I told you to get traveler 's checks , " Mrs. Sharma shrieked when Nilesh came back , his face bruised and the arm of his coat ripped off . Mr. Sharma slapped him , for that 's what he often did to his children in situations where he felt helpless . Their eighteen-year-old daughter , Nilima , fat and smart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn back . " She had strongly resisted the trip , saying she needed to study for her A-level exams , whereas everyone knew she did n't want to be away from her Jitendra , who was so stunningly handsome , with a sleek body and a puff of hair on his forehead , that Mr. and Mrs. Sharma often wondered what he saw in their fat daughter . Mrs. Sharma was convinced Jitendra wanted to marry Nilima for her parents ' money , which did n't make sense as the Sharma family was n't super rich . Mr. Sharma thought Jitendra was n't right in the head , and that the puff of hair hid an anomaly in his brain . <p> Fortunately , the cash wrenched away from Nilesh was n't the only money they 'd brought for the trip . Mrs. Sharma had another twenty thousand , which they hurriedly converted to traveler 's checks at the airport before boarding their plane to Bombay the next morning . Throughout the ride , Mrs. Sharma berated Nilesh , who had recently dropped out of college and spent all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who will marry you like this , huh ? So irresponsible . You 'll lose your wife during the wedding procession . " She mimicked him , " Oh , I lost my wife . I do n't know how it happened . One moment she was in my pocket , then these hoodlums came and snatched her away . " Mrs. Sharma laughed loud at her own impersonation , and a stewardess signaled to her to keep it down . Nilima was engrossed in a Stephen King novel , ignoring her mother 's rantings and her brother 's sullen face and timid objections . Mr. Sharma was reading the brochure on emergency steps to be taken should the plane plunge toward the earth . Yesterday 's jolts and screams had frightened him . He did n't want to die yet ; at least not before making love to Kanti , his neighbor 's maid who smiled at him coquettishly and did n't mind his sexual jokes . <p> At the airport in Bombay , no one came to pick them up . They waited . Mr. Sharma called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as another indication that they should hop on the next flight back to Kathmandu . Nilesh got into a staring match with two big , unshaven Indian boys who appeared ready to come over and do something to him had Mrs. Sharma not scowled at them . After two hours of waiting the Sharmas decided to take a taxi to Andheri , where Ahuja lived . Mrs. Sharma said that they should take the train , but Nilima outright laughed at the idea . " I 'd rather spend the night here at the airport than take the crowded , smelly train . " So they took a taxi . Mr. Sharma wondered what it 'd be like to visit Bombay with Kanti . They could run away together and live in one of the numerous shacks scattered throughout the city . She would wear skimpy clothes , her midriff showing , and he 'd make love to her all day long and into the night . Mrs. Sharma worried about how she was going to get her fat , smart daughter and her stupid son married . A couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had balked once they saw her , and Mrs. Sharma never heard anything further about the proposals . As for Nilesh , he 'd acquired a reputation as a no-good loafer , so no proposal had even winked his way . In her mind Mrs. Sharma saw Nilima married to Jitendra , which gave her a shudder , and she saw unmarriageable Nilesh roaming the streets , getting into drugs and fights , ending up in jail . <p> As the taxi crawled along the congested Bombay roads , Nilesh replayed last night 's mugging in his mind , over and over , but this time as soon as the muggers approached , Nilesh 's left foot shot up like lightning , instantly cracking open one man 's jaw ; Nilesh whirled and slammed , without looking , the back of his right fist on the second hoodlum 's nose , shattering it so a fountain of blood sprang forth and drenched a crowd of onlookers , who had miraculously appeared to see this brave young man in action and who now applauded as the two muggers crumpled to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee , Nilesh asked , " Anyone else ? " Nilesh fast-forwarded and rewound this scene over and over , perfecting his kick , making the muggers beg for mercy , and replacing the " Anyone else ? " with a howl . <p> Nilima turned another page of the novel : the family dog , it turned out , had supernatural powers . But was Rusty going to use it to ward off the evil forces ? Or was he going to join the dark side and destroy the family ? <p> Ahuja lived in a nice neighborhood in Andheri , on a quiet , tree-lined street . But no one was home-there was a giant padlock on the door . " They must have gone to the airport , " Mrs. Sharma said . " Let 's wait . " <p> It was only after they 'd waited for nearly two hours that a neighbor came over and told them that the Ahujas had gone on a vacation to the mountainous Nainital for two weeks . <p> " But that ca n't be , " Mr. Sharma said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him on the phone a week ago , and I 'd sent him a telegram from Patna about our flight 's delay . " <p> " You 're not the first one , " the neighbor said . " The Ahujas do this to their relatives all the time . " <p> The Sharmas dragged themselves into a taxi for a ride to a nearby hotel in Juhu Beach , which they knew would be heartchillingly expensive , but they were too tired and hot to go hunting for a cheap hotel . <p> They stayed in Bombay for only three days , not only because money was running out but also because Ahuja 's betrayal had soured everything . Nilima showed very little interest in the sight seeing they did , except for the Hanging Gardens , which she thought were " fabulous . " Nilesh became obsessed with the transvestites who roamed the city in groups . He stared at them , commenting upon their " manly " features . One time he laughed loudly as they passed by , and the hinjadas circled the Sharma family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred rupees did they leave , singing and clapping . Immediately Mrs. Sharma took off her sandal and smacked Nilesh on his head . <p> On the flight back to Kathmandu , they hardly spoke to one another . The trip had turned Mrs. Sharma even more apprehensive about her children 's marriage prospects-they were either stubborn or stupid . Mr. Sharma could hardly breathe in anticipation of touching Kanti 's midriff , which he knew he had to do the next time they were together alone . Nilima was devouring another book she 'd bought at the Bombay airport , a romantic thriller by Danielle Steele . Nilesh woke up from a short nap , scared . He had dreamt about making love to a transvestite and now had a terrifie hard-on . He put the airline magazine on his lap so his mother , sitting next to him , would n't notice . <p> " That 's the last trip we 'll take as a family , " Mrs. Sharma declared as they entered their house . Mr. Sharma immediately went for a walk , hoping that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusting a blanket , on her balcony , and that he 'd quietly approach her . Nilesh went into his room to practice his drums . This was another of his dreams-to become a rock star . He 'd tried guitar , but he could n't change chords fast enough and his fingers bled . With drums , all he needed to do was bang away , and there was a semblance of a beat . In his mind , women screamed and men danced as he played . The King of Drums , he was called . <p> Nilima did n't come home that night . She 'd gone to see Jitendra soon after they reached home , and the two of them decided they missed each other so much that it was time to consummate their bond . " Let 's stay in a hotel tonight , " Nilima said . " It 'll throw a real scare into my parents . Maybe then they 'll stop badmouthing you and get us married . " <p> " But they 'll be so worried , " Jitendra said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension , her parents . But Nilima was too persuasive for him , and they ended up in a hotel in Thamel . <p> Mr. Sharma did spot Kanti , not on her balcony but outside a shop in the neighborhood . She was talking with a man . Their body language told Mr. Sharma that this was more than a casual conversation . The man was young , about twenty-five , the same age as Kanti . With pangs of disappointment and anger , Mr. Sharma approached them . <p> " How was Bombay ? " Kanti asked when she saw him . Laughter was etched around her lips , and her eyes . <p> " Do n't you have work at home ? " Mr. Sharma asked sternly . " Why are you chatting here ? " <p> " I just came to buy something , " she said . <p> " Go home , go home , " Mr. Sharma said . " Who is he ? It 's not good to be standing here , chatting . It does n't look good . " <p> The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told Kanti and walked away . <p> Kanti and Mr. Sharma began walking . He used his soothing , intimate voice , the one he 'd never used on his wife , to mollify Kanti 's anger . " You should n't do these types of things in public . It 'll only bring criticism from everyone , and might even get you fired . I 'm a good man , so I wo n't tell your employer . But someone else might not be so nice . I am nice because I like you so much . You 're a nice girl . And I 'm a nice man . That 's what we have in common , and when people have things in common they can do many things together . I can teach you many things you did n't even know existed . Who is that man ? What can he give you that I ca n't , huh ? Tell me , what do you want ? Just utter the word , and it 's yours . " <p> Kanti , who was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from Bombay ? I want a gold necklace . " <p> They were nearing Kanti 's house . Mr. Sharma had to think fast . " Is that what you want ? You are my queen , so you 'll get what you want . But you also have to do what I ask . " His hand touched her midriff . <p> " We 'll see , " she said . " Let me see the necklace first , " and she slipped into her house . <p> Nilesh knew what his father was up to . His room was on the third floor of their house , and commanded a view of the surrounding alleys . He saw his father talking to the maid . Remembering his father 's slap in Patna , Nilesh wanted to go down and usher his mother outside so she could witness her husband 's desire . But Nilesh also remembered how she had berated him throughout the trip , and he thought-let her be ignorant of this , fun to watch her face when she finds out . Would n't it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his father and demanded a share of their property ? He envisioned a little stepbrother looking exactly like his father-the same prominent Brahmin nose , the long earlobes . Nilesh laughed and went back to his drumming . <p> By dinner , Mrs. Sharma had begun cursing Nilima . " At her age she should be helping me cook dinner so that when she gets married she wo n't be an idiot in the kitchen . We 've got to put a stop to this , do you hear me ? " she addressed her husband , who was wondering if Kanti would be able to tell the difference between a gold-coated necklace and a real one . He concluded she would , and ate another mouthful of rice . <p> " I do n't trust that Jitendra . What are you going to do about it ? " Mrs. Sharma asked her husband , then turned to her son . " And you , loafer supreme , how can anyone call you an older brother when you do n't take care of your sister ? " <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leave him alone , " Mr. Sharma said . " And leave us alone , at least for tonight . I do n't care what our daughter does . Just be quiet . " <p> Mrs. Sharma was going to retort , but she thought the better of it , and they all ate their meal in silence . <p> At ten o'clock that night , Mrs. Sharma called Jitendra 's house , something she 'd never done before . When she identified herself , the man at the other end said , " Oh . " No , Jitendra was n't home , neither was Nilima . Jitendra had called and said he was going to a latenight party . Had he gone with Nilima ? The man did n't know . Mrs. Sharma did n't ask him who he was-probably the boy 's father . <p> She went to her bedroom and woke her husband , and the two of them made phone calls to Nilima 's friends . Then Mrs. Sharma woke Nilesh violently from his sleep , and sent him out to search for his sister in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station , decided against it ; they talked of skinning Nilima alive were she to appear at the door shamefaced the next morning . Mrs. Sharma called Jitendra 's house again and argued with the sleepy-voiced father , telling him to keep his son away from her daughter . By one o'clock they were exhausted . Mr. and Mrs. Sharma sat on the couch , Nilesh on the floor leaning against the wall . He really wanted to go upstairs to sleep but was afraid of his mother 's tongue-lashing . <p> Nilima received a slap from her mother when she entered the house the next morning . <p> " I want to marry him , " she told her mother , nursing her cheek . " I do n't care what you say-I wo n't marry anyone else but Jitendra . " <p> Helplessly Mrs. Sharma looked at her husband . <p> " You 're still too young to be married , " Mr. Sharma said . " Why do n't you finish your A-level exams , then we can talk about it . But you ca n't spend nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tomorrow if he finds another girl , who 'll marry you ? " <p> " If you wo n't marry us , " Nilima said , " we 'll have a court wedding . We 've already decided . " <p> Mrs. Sharma stepped forward to dole out another slap , but her husband stopped her . " Wait , daughter , what 's the hurry ? Finish your exams first , then marry him . That 's all we 're saying . " <p> Nilima considered . " Okay , but get us engaged now . And we 'll marry after my exams . " <p> Mrs. Sharma left the room in a huff . Nilesh folded his arms and watched the back and forth between his father and his sister . He knew he was expected to be angry at his sister , probably even shove her around a bit , threaten to beat up Jitendra , but all he felt was admiration . She had a sense of defiance he himself lacked . She 'd really shown them that they could n't push her around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting in bed , doodling . <p> " What did you do last night ? " he asked . <p> " What business is it of yours ? " <p> " Good , very good . My little sister is really grown-up now . " <p> " I 'm glad you noticed , " she said . <p> " Did you ... really ... ? You do n't have to answer . " <p> " You 're a strange brother . But yes , I did . " <p> " Just to spite them ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't know . Now go and do your stupid things . " <p> Mrs. Sharma called Jitendra 's father , Changu , and arranged for a meeting . That evening Mr. and Mrs. Sharma went to Jitendra 's house , a nice-looking building in New Baneswor with a large yard and two cars . Mrs. Sharma told Changu what her daughter had said . " Frankly , we do n't think she should be married right now , " Mrs. Sharma said . Before , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the family 's obvious prosperity had softened her stance toward Jitendra . Instead , she said , " But what to do ? Their eyes are fixed on each other . " <p> " These young people , " Changu said . " Once their minds are made up , even Lord Indra 's dad Chandra ca n't shake them . " <p> There was silence , while they contemplated the mysterious ways of the young . Changu was smoking from a hookah . He took a long drag , then said , " Well , you 're a good family , and we also do n't have a bad name in town . If they want to get engaged , let them do it . If we do n't agree to this and they decide to elope , our noses will be cut . " His index finger mock-serrated the tip of his nose as illustration . <p> On the way home , Mrs. Sharma said , " Well , at least they 're not poor . That was a nice house , and he seemed like a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hustle-bustle of the engagement , he should be able to siphon off a few thousand rupees for the gold necklace . Perfect , oh , perfect , he thought . That damn Kanti . She had been avoiding coming to the balcony , as if challenging him about his gift . He had to get that gold necklace for her if he wanted to make any progress . <p> The engagement date was fixed for three weeks later , with a promise from both Jitendra and Nilima that they would spend nights in their respective beds and that Nilima would study for her exams at least a few hours a day . Jitendra had to study for nothing . He 'd failed his School Leaving Certificate exams twice , and everyone expected him to fail the third time , too . That her future son-in-law , like her son , was academically inept bothered Mrs. Sharma . " What is he going to become without even an SLC ? A peon ? How is he going to feed Nilima ? " <p> " She 's going to feed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister 's actions , he 'd become bolder in talking to his mother . <p> " Look who is talking , " Mrs. Sharma said . " Loafer , good-fornothing . And what are you going to become ? Who is going to marry you ? " <p> " If someone like you could find a husband , " Nilesh said , " why would n't I find a wife ? " <p> Mr. Sharma laughed , and Mrs. Sharma tried to smack her son but he made a scary face and said , " Do n't you dare . " And Mrs. Sharma did n't dare-she was losing control over her family , and she did n't even know about Kanti yet . <p> The incredibly handsome but SLC-failed boy got engaged to the fat , smart girl . Nilima was already pregnant , a fact she hid from everybody , even Jitendra . What she herself did n't know was that the baby would be stillborn , and that it would break her heart , starting her on bouts of depression that would last a lifetime , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side until she died . They would not have another child . " I 'm dry , I 'm dry , " Nilima would cry late into the night , and Jitendra would soothe her with his soft voice emerging from those delicate lips . But for now Nilima was pregnant and happy , and she knew she would do well in her A-level exams because she was smart and knew everything . <p> Mr. Sharma made love to Kanti two neighborhoods away in a small room that belonged to a carpenter who 'd done odd jobs in his house . For his " hospitality , " the carpenter received five hundred rupees , with a strict warning not to divulge Mr. Sharma 's secret to anyone . Kanti had already received her necklace , a tenthousand-rupee affair he 'd found in a shop in New Road . Mr. Sharma had n't felt so alive in years , certainly not all those times he 'd slept with his wife . Kanti was adept at pleasing a man-her tongue did wonderful things to Mr. Sharma 's aging body . Loud noises-laughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , and he knew he would do it again and again and again with Kanti , and feel younger and younger . Little did Mr. Sharma know that he 'd gotten Kanti pregnant right on that first day ( the condom had broken during penetration ) , and she 'd give birth to a baby boy who looked exactly like his father , as the other son had so faithfully intuited . That afternoon Mr. Sharma also did n't know that Mrs. Sharma would eventually divorce him , something he could n't ever have imagined his wife doing to him . She 'd put all their property in her name , then file for divorce , forcing him to live poorly with Kanti and their new son , shunned by friends , relatives , and even the carpenter on whose bed he 'd manufactured his look-alike progeny . Mr. Sharma would deal with this ostracism with laughter on his lips and happiness in his heart . Every moment spent with Kanti would turn out to be heavenly bliss , even though Kanti 's midriff would sag after their son 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would be proud of this incredible turn his life had taken . <p> Mrs. Sharma worried about Nilima . The A-level exams were only two weeks away , but Nilima had taken her engagement with Jitendra as a license to spend all day at his house . Mrs. Sharma cursed Changu for being so lenient , but she did n't say anything for fear of spoiling the new in-law relationship . In a way , she was relieved about Nilima 's impending wedding . Jitendra was foolish and immature , but he doted on Nilima . Despite herself , Mrs. Sharma had grown to like Jitendra , who was always polite and sweet . Not like Nilesh , whose sullen face only aroused her anger . <p> And Nilesh ? What was going to happen to him ? Defying everyone 's expectations , and surprising even himself , Nilesh would become one of the leading movie actors in the country . He 'd haunt the dreams of young girls and boys , who would cover their bedroom walls with his posters and pray to him more than they prayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he would star in movies that would not only become blockbusters but also win him accolades from even the most bitter of critics . He would end up owning his own production company that would make one hit after another . No one could have predicted this , but this is how the world works . One moment , you are stuck , and then the moment expands , as if God were forcing it open with his pretty bare hands , and you find yourself in another dimension , and you are still you but the world around you has suddenly changed colors . <p> Mrs. Sharma 's colors would change , too , but right now , wrapped in worries about her children , while her husband explored Kanti 's body in the carpenter 's bedroom , she did n't know that after her divorce , she would discover , in the temple of Swayambhunath , a swami whose soft words would make sense of the suffering inflicted upon her by her husband . She would see , in a millisecond of remarkable clarity ( God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering upon herself , that all suffering was self-induced , and-this is where her spiritual revolution would begin-that all of life was suffering . This insight would lead her to a place deep inside her where she would no longer feel her physical self . Her body would turn into air , and she would fly over the city , glimpsing into the lives of her one-time family , their suffering : " I want to die , " bedridden Nilima would say to her husband ; Nilesh would laugh at a film clip in the air-conditioned auditorium in his luxury house , his arm around another man 's shoulder ; Mr. Sharma would accompany his look-alike son to his first day in school . <p> Author
