Present day Her whole world at the moment consisted of warm sun and cool sand , the gentle shush of the tide . Palm fronds rustled in the breeze behind her , and before her lay nothing but blue ocean and the calm , straight line of the horizon . She 'd come here to relax . Unwind . Escape . No , wait -- not escape . Where had that come from ? She 'd come here to prepare . Yes , that was better . It was a . . . transitional period . The period when she would transform from her normal , fun-loving self into someone 's wife . But not just someone . A respected attorney . Who was also an investor --  " gifted at it , " her father said -- and thus had more money than God . She had n't the faintest idea how she was going to be that kind of wife -- the kind who hosted garden parties and Sunday brunches , the kind who could hold a glass of wine in her hand all evening at a cocktail party without ever getting tipsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " tipsy and giggly . " But those days were behind her now -- they had to be . Hence the transitional period , the sun and the sand . It truly was tranquil here . Her father had only bought the private island off the Gulf Coast of Florida last year , so they had n't made any improvements yet , but once she and Ian were married , maybe she 'd suggest they make a gift to her parents -- perhaps a new beach house , a new dock for the boats . People said money could n't buy happiness , but Kat knew better . Nothing would make her father happier than a shiny new beach house , courtesy of his daughter and new son-in-law . She could almost feel his smile beaming at her already . A vision flashed in her mind -- her , in a few years , as a mom , corralling a little boy and girl on this same beach . The children were adorable , exploring , occasionally picking up a sand dollar or a broken bit of shell . They all wore light colors , whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats and flowy sundresses . Somewhere in the distance , her father and Ian grilled steaks and drank martinis while her mother festooned a picnic table with brightly colored place mats and arranged peach-colored napkins in a fan shape to bloom from stemmed glasses . Why did such a lovely image make her want to throw up ? She liked kids , after all . She spent each and every Saturday afternoon with kids at The Kiln , teaching them to throw pots . A messy and sometimes semidisastrous pastime , but pottery was her passion . She loved sharing it with children who were n't as fortunate as she 'd been and who needed a distraction from the harsher realities of their lives . And she liked steak and martinis and decorative napkins , too . Who did n't ? So what was wrong with this picture ? She sighed , thinking . It was n't that she did n't want to be married . She did -- she always had . Sure , everyone thought of her as Crazy Kat , party girl extraordinaire -- but deep inside , all she 'd ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , a world with . And she loved her parents , and she loved Ian 's parents , and you really could n't find a guy who was more respected or even better-looking than Ian . He was a catch -- everyone said so . So that settled it , once and for all . There was nothing wrong with the picture . She was simply going to suffer a steep learning curve in terms of being a sophisticated wife , that was all . And really , it should n't be that much of a stretch -- she 'd been masquerading as a sophisticated daughter all her life and gotten by okay . And Ian did n't love her because she was sophisticated -- he loved the real her , even the party her . He 'd once told her that . So this was all going to be just fine . A damn good thing given that the wedding was only seven days away . The trill of her cell phone jarred her from her thoughts as she plucked it up from the sand next to her lounge chair , then mentally prepared herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear the sounds of slot machines behind her . " Hello ? " " Viva Las Vegas , baby ! " No , just her lifelong best friend Nina -- and it was Kat who heard the whirring sounds of electronic gambling in the background . " I 'm coming to you live from Caesar 's Palace ! " " So you guys made it in okay , " Kat said , envisioning her five best buds partying without her in Sin City . " Yeah , and --  " Nina stopped , just briefly . " Oh . My . God . The hottest soldier in the entire Roman army just walked by ! " " Down , girl , " Kat said dryly , at once sorry to be missing the fun but at the same time so removed from it that it did n't matter -- she had bigger things on her mind . " In a few minutes , we 're going to walk over to Treasure Island and try to pick up some pirates . Swarthy ones , with scars . God , I ca n't believe you 're missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a hundred , I still wo n't believe you actually bailed on your own bachelorette party . " Nina let out a long , slow sigh , and then -- if Kat was n't mistaken -- took a slurping sip from a beverage undoubtedly high in alcoholic content . " Are you sure you wo n't change your mind ? " " Too late now . I 'm here , and you 're there . " Nina 's voice dropped so that Kat could barely hear her over the sounds of the slots . " No . I meant about the wedding . " Now it was Kat 's turn to sigh as her stomach twisted . Why could n't Nina just let this go ? She was marrying Ian , and that was that . " Would you please drop it already ? " " You do n't love him . " Here we go again . " Of course I love him . I 've known him my whole life . " " I 've known you my whole life , but that does n't mean I 'm marrying you .
