BADGER CATCHES THE LATEST CRUNCH of gravel and sees a multicolored Volkswagen van pull up to the porch . Careful not to show too much interest , she calls out , " The Gizmobus is here . " After several relays of the news , feet pound down the main stairway , along the hall , out of the kitchen . Badger 's older brother Bell leads the delegation as these are all his guests . The screen door slams repeatedly . Without looking , Badger savors her mother 's mild exasperation . Poor mother , she asks so little , and gets even less . Outside , the others crowd around the van . Jacob , Alex , Trey , and Nia pile out while Puck checks the portable beach on top . A fount of allusions , Jacob takes a deep breath of the mountain air and exclaims , " Ah , oxygen ! " Puck is pleased that the beach is largely intact . The first time he took it on the freeway , most of it blew away . Erosion , Jacob said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That and the showers they 've come through have done the trick . EUy May 's shovel is still planted in sand . From the kitchen window Merrill Ransom views the mannequin torso dressed in a one-piece swimsuit and sporting long blond ringlets under a baseball cap . Her son certainly has a colorful set of friends . Badger appears from the great room . Her hair , in fuchsia spikes until recently , hangs in an uneven jet-black cowl . She is at an awkward stage between her punk and goth personae . As usual , though , her mother will need enlightening , so she has come . " When she wears the blond wig , she 's Elly May ; in her straight red hair she 's the evil twin Quilla June . " Mrs. Ransom nods , informed on one level , mystified on another . She knows that her daughter needs her to remain in this state , at least through the adolescent years . Backpacks and luggage are mounting in the entryway , so she goes out to greet the company . Just then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge rubber ball , which he lowers gently to the floor . By way of introduction he says , " Prover . " All the young people smile , as if this were yet another strange mascot . Mrs. Ransom is given to understand that this ball , which once helped move oil through a pipeline , will play a role in her son 's best-man contest . The contestants are two boys and a girl . She looks at the new arrivals and tries to connect the stories she 's heard with the bright faces . Good-natured mischief surrounds her . " I 'm glad that Greenwich House is sturdily built . " Her half-serious joke is a success . She is accepted as the bemused but nurturing parent figure . Everyone has arrived . The house , once a hotel and now a family retreat , is large enough to accommodate fifteen people with room to spare . Even with the third floor removed after a fire , there is plenty of space for socializing and privacy . Jacob admires the wide , high hallway running the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen doors at each end , a giant breezeway . The guest rooms , each with its own bath , Une the hall on both sides . It does matter which room you get because while all have large , claw-foot tubs with porcelain-inlaid knobs labeled hot and COLD , only some are fitted with shower nozzles . The toilets are gravity fed , with raised tanks and pull chains . Pipes bang between the walls like furious prisoners . Walking by the nursery , he sees Reese sketching the haphazard assortment of teddies , dolls , and toys in early morning light . When she is finished , it will be another accomplished watercolor . From farther down the hall comes the sound of a cello . That would be Reeses friend Po , whose life is practice . Jacob himself has started to write poems , but he does n't share them . His graduate studies in English have led him to compose verse that is high-powered , compressed , and fairly abstract . He wonders what , if anything , he would have to say about bears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slouched in a wicker armchair , reading . He has discovered a treasure trove of magazines going back decades : Architectural Digest , Look , white-faced National Geographic . Jacob peers over his shoulder at an article on monkey puzzle trees . He likes how Warren is interested in everything . After six years and five majors he stiil refuses to pigeonhole himself . If you want to know about Murnau , the Sepoy Mutiny , or coelacanths , he 's your guy . Jacob predicts that someday Warren will be a stellar professor of Things in General . Ronald , however , expects he may become one of those weird hermits who hangs around the college library the rest of his life . In the great room Trey and Brent are getting in a game of Ping-Pong before breakfast . Watching them , Jacob admits that he belongs in the granny league , where the ball is politely tapped over the net in generous arcs . These guys pull back from the table for acutely angled smashes . Brent enjoys a court advantage because Trey is backed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at physical activities evens the odds . Barely able to follow the extended volley , Jacob considers the genius of body knowledge , quicker than conscious thought . " Use the Force , Jacob . Do n't try to guide the paddle . " Nia has come up beside him . " I 'll bet either of them could beat me blindfolded . " " That would n't be a bad exercise for you . Fold up one side of the table and learn to follow the sound , just get the feel . " As an undergrad pre-med Nia minored in religious studies . It 's not that she 's interested in religion as such , but she has this theory that the body harbors deep resources , including healing powers tapped through prayer and meditation . People tend to misunderstand and think she 's going on about miracles . As far as Jacob can make out , it 's more a matter of enhancing the autonomie by opening up neural and vascular channels , a kind of psychosomatic wise passivity . After a certain point in her explanations Nia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathom the biochemistry behind it all , but feels comfortable telling Jacob because she senses his faith in her . More people are straggling in now , drawn by the bountiful breakfast Mrs. Ransom has laid out for their first morning here . As they fill spaces at the large table and start to dig in , talk turns to the best-man contest . The first event , staged in the labyrinthine steam tunnels under the college campus , has already occurred . Coded clues based on sci-fi novels led to the winning object , a bicycle seat sprouting handlebars made by the bride-to-be herself . Reese freely confesses her artistic debt . Jacob assures , " Swiping is the sincerest form of flattery " " Actually , it looked more like a longhorn than a bull to me , " Ronald puts in . " You should have used drop bars instead of low-rise . " Through Ronald 's chronic criticism Alex detects his frustration at coming in second . The event did seem tailor-made for her as a double major in computer science and classical studies . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You object to everything . " A palpable hit . He has no comeback , so chomps down hard on a piece of French toast . As far as he 's concerned , Alex just wants to win in order to make a big feminist joke . Mrs. Ransom gently turns the tiller . " And what is the next event ? " " Prover hauling , " Puck answers , as master of ceremonies . " They have to get it from one end of your pool to the other . " Professor Ransom adds , " And later , dear , I 'm to take them to the river for rapids shooting in inner tubes . " At the merest glance from his wife he finishes , " And safety helmets . " Bell 's younger brother , Leaf , considers how he would get a fifty-pound rubber ball across the pool . All this company and activity are exciting , but he 'll keep to the background . At the moment he is following three conversations . Brent and Ronald are arguing about automatic shifters for bikes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can run in the thousands . And his father is discussing optics and color theory with Reese and Nia . It all reminds him of something he read about the collective intelligence of ants and termites . Puck stands at the deep end with a stopwatch and whistle . Ronald is up first . At the signal he leaps into the pool with Prover in his arms and walks it to the dropoff , then scissor-kicks furiously to keep himself and it afloat . For a moment he tries stroking with one arm , but loses his grip on the ball and struggles to recover . Upon finally reaching the edge , he has to get a shoulder under Prover and muscle it out of the water . No one is sure yet if his time is good or not . Assessing his performance , Alex tries a different approach . She lets Prover sink and rolls it along the bottom , giving it a good push down the incline to the deep end . Then she dives to retrieve it . However , she fails to lift it on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her second effort succeeds , but she loses crucial seconds trying to clear the pool 's edge . Trey must now beat Ronald 's time . Standing back , he lifts Prover over his head and bounces it hugely off the concrete , diving after it as it makes a cannonball splash nearly midway . Like Alex , he lets it roll down to the deep end , and is able to retrieve it on the first try , powering up with it already on his shoulder for a clean hoist out of the pool , besting Ronald by twenty seconds . The spectators applaud this combination of strategy and brute strength . Meanwhile , Bell checks the concrete for a telltale crater . Jacob sees this is another group outing that will be heavily documented . He counts the 35mm cameras among them : eight . The likelihood of being treated to yet another debate on film brands , shutter speeds , and f-stops appears very high . As he turns he spots himself squarely in Brent 's sights . Puck coaxes , " Come on now , Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " Nia gets a shot of Brent trying to take his picture . Resigned , Jacob quips , " Apparently the unphotographed life is n't worth living . " Brent snaps him midsentence . Nia helps Mrs. Ransom make lunch . Once they 've reached a smooth work rhythm , a kind of kitchen intimacy , she asks about the Ransom children 's nicknames . Mrs. Ransom sighs . " Lane and I gave them names , and now they 're all called after things . " " Bell is your son 's middle name , is n't it ? " " Yes , but he 's called that because of a prank that got him kicked out of boarding school . There 's a bell tower on the campus that starts ringing at six each morning . Arthur has never been an early riser and grew tired of the racket , as he phrased it . So one night he took a canister of quick-hardening foam from the chemistry lab , climbed the tower , and sprayed all the clappers . The next morning only a dull clunking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How did they catch him ? " " He used his student ID to slip the lock on the laboratory door , then left it on a counter . " " His calling card . An oversight ? " " I 've had my suspicions . " Mrs. Ransom finishes slicing a ham , then says in confidence , " I believe he was homesick . " Nia tucks away the insight . " And Badger 's story ? " " A simpler one . Her given name was Padgett , but her younger brother could n't quite pronounce it , so before long everyone was calling her Badger . " " Ah . And Leaf ? A good , 19605 back-to-nature name . " Originally L-e-i-f . But it was misspelled so often on forms and rosters that he just started spelling it that way himself . " " I think I 've heard Badger call him something else . " " Mole . She says it 's because he keeps popping up suddenly with odd ideas and hobbies . " Nia expresses her gratitude by tackling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stories . The three contestants are seated in a corner of the great room with paper and pen . It is time for the Civil War quiz , questions courtesy of Warren and Bell , who pose them in turn . " Number one : Whose hanging did John Wilkes Booth witness in December 1859 ? " A soft-pitch start . Answers are confidently scribbled . Across the room Leaf is draped over an armchair practicing a magic trick that involves an egg and a bra . The latter he has borrowed from his sister without telling her . If the trick works , he wo n't have any explaining to do . " Six : Who designed the Union ironclad USS Monitor7 , " Ronald scratches out his answer , writes another , then scratches that out and puts the first down again . Unseen , Reese has slipped into the room and started to sketch Leaf . He is keeping one ear on the questions , about half of which he can answer . Brent and Nia pass through on their way to the pond to throw bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stonewall Jackson 's left arm buried ? " Ronald groans , " You got ta be kidding . " The Golden Book of the Civil War has failed him . " Is this a Grant 's Tomb kind of question ? " He sees that Alex 's pen is poised , but Trey is writing something . " The history major gets a walk in the park . When will I have a natural advantage ? " Alex pounces . " What do you want , a ci vil-engineer ing quiz ? " " Yeah , that 'll do just fine . " Ronald taps his pen in annoyance , then writes , " The Confederate Left-Arm Cemetery . " Reese wonders if she can catch the look on Leaf 's face , occupied and amused on several levels , but discreetly so . She likes sketching people best when they are unaware , unconsciously being themselves , " Nineteen : Who was Captain Henry Wirz ? " The grandfather clock in the dining area clears its mechanical throat and formally reports the hour . As Bell and Warren tally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " If we gave credit for random , desperate responses , Ronald would be the winner . However , as it stands , Trey came in first with sixteen out of twenty , followed by Alex with eleven , and Ronald with nine . " The group breaks up as Ronald continues to defend his definition of Copperheads . Somewhat later , Reese gives Leaf the sketch . Though he only murmurs thanks and avoids eye contact , he is actually quite pleased . The only thing better , in fact , would be a sketch of herself . Bell sits on the side porch reading Dickens in his Better Living Through Electrical Stuff T-shirt . He means to read all the novels this summer . And he 'll do it too , averaging as he does a hundred pages an hour . Jacob stands in the doorway watching his finger slalom down the page . Slalom , slalom , flip . Slalom , slalom , flip . " You do know I hate you for that . " Bell looks up , nonplussed . " Reading Dickens ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll bet you 're mainly in it for the characters and plot " , " That 's bad ? " " There 's so much more : style , tonal modulation , structure . Do you pause to consider how he constructs his sentences , paragraphs , chapters ? Do you know he published his novels at first in serial installments ? " " So it takes you forever to finish one . " " Exactly . And it pains me to see you tearing through with such reckless pleasure when you could be experiencing it in a more laborious , responsible way . " Bell reflects a moment " I 'm probably more the kind of reader Dickens had in mind . " Jacob has brought enlightenment once again . " Exactly " Badger is pissed . This is nothing out of the ordinary , but there 's a specific reason this time . One of her black bras is missing . Someone has taken it . Mole . She checks herself . Her mother says she 's in the habit of blaming him first . Sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankle . She 's been tempted to get a real tattoo but ca n't settle on a particular design for a particular body part . If she had broken down and gotten a punk one , she knows she 'd be tired of it already . It would clash with her current self , the one listening to Bauhaus . She has their poster on her wall . It shows a nude boy blowing a long horn . Looking at it absently , her mind wanders . She imagines scenarios in which she strikes up a casual conversation with Ronald . Next thing she 's standing in front of the mirror , mouthing the words to " Bela Lugosi 's Dead . " He was one of those creepy Eastern European guys , she 's not sure which one . The Hunchback maybe . Frowning , she glares at the door . What is that noise ? Building together the remote-controlled helicopter has been a brotherly bonding experience for Bell and Leaf . And Greenwich House is the perfect test site . Armed with dual controls , they stand on opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one signal falters , the other should pick up . On the first try Leaf gets the chopper tangled in an overhanging bough at the side of the house . Their mother has been wanting it cut back anyway , so they get out the saws . The next attempt almost succeeds , but Bell clips a gutter and sends the bird splraling to the ground . After some blade triage they launch again , and this time it circumnavigates the house repeatedly . So next they open the screen doors on the second floor for the real test . They will be flying partly blind here . Bell lines the chopper up and calls out , " Here it comes , " then pushes the joystick forward . The big unknown is whether they will lose contact with it even for a second . Leaf stands far back from the house with the control stick pulled straight toward him . Suddenly the bird emerges , and he lets out a whoop , then shouts that he 's sending it back . They run the hallway canyon a number of times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears on the porch steps and admonishes , " Arthur , dear , not through the house , please . " Straying down to the fence line , Jacob is buzzed . He flinches , turns , and waves to the house . The need to be alone has come over him . It rises unpredictably when he is with others . He feels himself fading , withdrawing , and slips from the room . Even in group photos he stands slightly apart . Reese has written in her illustrated journal , " Jacob is an oyster . " On this side the grass is mown ; on that , it and the weeds sway waist-high . He makes out paths , one of which probably leads to the pond . It seems that even when you know where a path goes , it still beckons , as if it went elsewhere . After ten minutes he is refreshed . Puck joins him at the fence . Jacob wants a second opinion . " Is someone playing Dylan out there ? " Puck listens , then gives him a wry look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Gizmobus curves along a deserted two-lane in the vicinity . Puck and Jacob sit in front . Puck drives , Jacob holds the Oreos . In back the contestants ask for some to eat . After the event , Jacob insists . Brent , Nia , and Warren follow in Brent 's car . They will be spotters . On a straight stretch both vehicles pull over . Nia draws a thick chalk line across the road as Brent and Warren take up positions farther along . The Gizmobus goes about a half mile back and turns around , then quickly accelerates . By the time it reaches the line it is moving at 40 mph . Suddenly , an Oreo appears on the road , wobbling , and flips across the shoulder into the brush . As this is their first experience rolling Oreos , the contestants get three trial runs apiece . Puck and Jacob offer advice . Select a cookie whose chocolate rims are perfectly aligned for a smooth roll . Keep the cookie absolutely vertical on the drop . Do n't drop the cookie from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better . Instructed , each roller lies on the floor of the van with an arm out the open door , cookie poised . As close to the line as possible , but not beyond it , the cookie is dropped . The initial drops are quick disasters , but by the third round , technique is starting to show . On the run that counts , Trey 's Oreo starts well but hits a stone in the road and disintegrates into cookie flak . " Them 's the breaks , " Ronald philosophizes . His Oreo , however , splits , ejecting its creamy filling ; one rim swerves off the road , while the other bobs along erratically until it falls over , tired . Puck rules that the result will be the average distance traveled by the two halves . This seems acceptable to Ronald until Alex 's roll falls just short of his farther rim , yet beating his average . Only when Puck threatens to penalize him ten yards for arguing does he grudgingly take his second place . Driving back , they scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a herd of dylans . That evening Puck , Jacob , and Nia play free-form Scrabble . Puck lays down his letters : FLARDA . " Blown-out tire strips on the freeway . " The others approve . Nia builds on his first vowel , emptying her tray . " BLEGSQUA : endless bickering over how to divide a restaurant bill . " They definitely see a need for that word . Jacob latches onto Puck 's penultimate letter with UDODI . " Smashed bugs on a car grille . " This is good , but Puck decides to give him a hard time anyway . " Use it in a sentence . " Jacob , defiant : " Do n't step on my blue suede udodi . " Mrs. Ransom steps outside to give a treat to Dutch , good dog who keeps the geese out of the pool . Yesterday she saw a couple roosting in the portable beach . Today the house is quiet . Her husband has taken all the young people to float the Nantahala . Except Po , who practices in her room upstairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Ransom wishes Po could enjoy herself a little more . But excellence has its price . The music coming from the open window is wonderful . This week the house is filled with so many different talents . Their minds move so quickly and range so widely that her own nearly spins trying to follow their talk . Soon all that potential will realize itself as they settle on careers and lives . Then will come the choices , the parings . Yes , and the disappointments . There was a time when she thought she might be able to do something in the literary way . All her college writings are stowed away now . But the years with her brilliant husband and gifted , unpredictable children have been good ones . It has been a fulfillment . What to do when the children are grown , that is a new , slowly looming challenge . With Dutch at her heels she goes to clip the gladiolus that are so abundant this year . In cut crystal vases they make for such dramatic displays . She gathers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plaintive sounds . Crap . That 's how she 's playing today , sawing away like an amateur . It makes her so angry she could scrape the bow across her forearm until she bleeds . She wo n't though ; bows are too expensive . It 's Beethoven . He 's constantly pointing out her defects . Po pictures him standing over her with a baton , saying , " My dear girl , liebchen , all your hard work makes you at best merely good . And we both know that good leads to Tulsa , not Vienna . " In reprisal she summons a conversation she overheard between Brent and Ronald . They were talking about an impossibly complicated piece of machinery they 'd come across , and one of them declared , " It 's very German . " But it 's not just the technical challenge . With effort she can master that . There 's a virtuosic relaxation beyond mastery that she finds so hard to reach . Coming here , getting out of her practice cubicle and apartment , was supposed to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different place . Her day would probably have been better spent with the others on the river . She starts to imagine that , but the vision culminates with her playing the Archduke Trio in a canoe headed over a waterfall . Smiling grimly she starts again . In the country , there you can see the stars . All six thousand . They he on the slope below the pool , rehearsing the day 's events . The drive into the Smokies . The lunchtime lack of hot dog and hamburger buns . The thrilling inner-tube competition at floats end . " Those rapids are scary close up . Even in a canoe , much less a rubber ring " " A rubber ring and a paddle . " " Which , if you noticed , they used as much to push away from rocks as to navigate . " " Did y'all see Ronald 's after he dropped it ? Puck found it downstream wrapped around that big daddy boulder . " " And he manages to come in second anyhow . " Professor Ransom joins them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and means to know more . He 's helping design a deep-space telescope for NASA . The farther out they can look , the further back they 'll see . It makes the cosmos sound like a vastly expanding time-lapse projection room . Soon they 're discussing the importance of imagination in science , especially the large and small ends of physics . Einstein 's thought experiments are mentioned , but the speculations of science fiction are what they really want to raise . Dr. Ransom opens the door by admitting the partly guilty pleasure he takes in the genre . Then they 're off on favorite authors and wild concepts . Feeling on friendly ground with the science and engineering types , Jacob ventures a theory : " Suppose the Big Bang was the pinprick far side of a black hole . That would make the whole shebang a multiverse . " By turn they gleam in Dr. Ransom 's encouraging presence , respecting his achievement , sensing his regard for their promise . As no one wants to be the first to break this gathering , they talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puck explains a T-shirt from the river trip to Mrs. Ransom . It depicts a couple guys who run an old filling station . " Now their dog is strategically placed to cover the fact it 's missing a leg . " " Puck called it Tripod , " Reese adds as she herself sketches Dutch . Mrs. Ransom lifts a brow . " Well , if the name fits , " he offers in defense . Nia pauses over her crossword . " Animals are adaptable . It hobbled around at a good clip . " " I wonder , " Alex wonders , " if there are prosthetics for animals . " Puck ca n't resist . " Like a peg leg for Fluffy . " " Most pets have four support limbs to start , so there 's not as much call as for us , " Nia interjects , trying to keep the tone from degenerating . Brent grows conjectural . " If a dog lost two legs , say the left front and right hind ... " Reese registers shock and covers Dutch 's ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , just as Ronald , drawn by the magnetic field of an emerging argument , comes out on the porch . A subtopic is raised . " Would this creature be a biped ? " " Or maybe a dipod . " Only if it scans . " Warren gets the engine back on track . " I read about a retriever that lost both its left legs and after some effort learned to limp along . " " Impossible , " Ronald scoffs . " It would tip over . " " Maybe not " Brent muses , " if it employed its tail as a counterbalance " A heated discussion on the mechanics of locomotion follows . Having been subjected to any number of these technical donnybrooks , Jacob takes the species to its triumphant conclusion . " I knew a dog with one leg that used its tail as a propeller . It kind of scooted across the floor . When excited , it did pirouettes . " The conversation lies smoking in a ditch . At a loss , Ronald falls back on the standard dismissal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands on his dignity . " I 'll have you know , sirrah , I have acted Euripides in the original Greek . I have rappelled from the heights of the biochemistry building . " He pauses , then delivers the coup de grce . " I have seen Rock City . " Rain all afternoon . Sundry indoor pursuits . Po and Badger try to play " Louie , Louie " on a concertina dug up from the basement . Warren informs Leaf about the Golden Section in exchange for a lesson on knot tying . Bell and Jacob square off at chess . Jacob takes a rook . Nodding , Bell observes , " Your kung fii is strong , but mine is stronger . Check " A few minutes later Puck wanders up and saves Jacob from nearly certain defeat . He 's needed for the soda event . On the way to northwest Georgia he , Puck , and Nia scoured every health store and Mom-and-Pop grocery they came across , looking for dubious soft drinks . The most objectionable ones now await the contestants in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miniature croquet still lies on the pool table . Puck explains the rules . " You will drink six ounces of each beverage . There are five of them , ranked by the soda committee on a revulsion scale . You are not to hold your breath while drinking . If you can not swallow what is in your mouth , you may avail yourself of the spit bucket " He holds up a galvanized pail and waxes nostalgic . " It 's just like the one I used for Halloween the year I went as Clem Potash , West Virginia miner . I rubbed charcoal on my palm and coughed coal dust through my fist . " Ronald shakes his head . " You 've been strange a long time , have n't you ? " Alex counters , " This from a guy who ran through the women 's commons in a shaving-cream thong . " " It was a bet . I won twenty bucks . " " Inflated wages . " Trey asks , " What if each of us finishes all five ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puck warrants . They start the first round . Alex grimaces . " Yuck , it 's warm . " " That 's so you get the full bouquet . " She finishes her cup . Ronald and Trey do likewise , with looks of mild displeasure . Afterward they compare notes : tepid , vaguely vegetal , with a stale aftertaste . Nia produces the bottle : Celery Soda . Next they 're handed cups with a fizzy , pink liquid . This is a little harder to stomach , but nobody uses the bucket . Trey ventures an analysis . " It 's something a sugar-crazed kid might like : cloyingly sweet , chalky and fruity at the same time . It 's very familiar , like ... uh ... " Puck , in an announcer 's voice : " That 's right , young man , it 's bubble-gum pop , the Bazooka you can drink ! " As memories of little comics and trading cards flood through them , the three are confronted with a new mystery soda , dark red , heavy looking , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It , too , is a known taste , detested from early youth , here given a perverse , liquefied twist . Through sheer force of will she chokes it down . Trey also struggles , but Ronald , intrigued , sips almost as if he were savoring the misguided inspiration of it . Finishing , he explains , " I 've always kind of liked licorice . " During a short break the three commend the committee on its ranking and steel themselves for the next degree of assault . The difference is exponential . Alex betrays shock , but she continues downing the amber concoction in slow , steady drafts . " That was truly awful , " she reports from the far bank , " but , oddly , it was the kind of awful I could handle . " Trey can not . He starts to swallow and stops . A puzzled expression crosses his face . Nia interprets . " That 's your brain telling you not to ingest this liquid . It probably thinks it 's a self-protection issue . " After a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between spits he remarks , " pulpy . . . mealy . . . rancid . " Ronald sees his only chance is to get it down before his brain knows what he 's doing . But then preconscious activity is one of his strengths . In two fast gulps he empties the cup , then fights to keep it down as his gorge rises in protest . He succeeds , but afterward wishes he could run his tongue over the pool table 's felt . Jacob displays the culprit : Guava-Apricot Cocktail . Glancing at the back of the bottle , he notices that it 's a year past its expiration date . He decides to keep that to himself . With some trepidation the two remaining contestants eye the effervescent sludge that 's now being poured them . Alex raises her glass : " Skoal . " At the first mouthful she starts fanning her hand and puffing her cheeks . Puck offers the bucket . Without hesitating she uses it . " Ugh , that stuff is evil . I ca n't believe anyone would bottle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fenders . " Ronald grabs his glass and tries his bolting strategy again . But this time his brain is ready and punishes the presumption . Halfway through he shows signs of rejection : gagging , shuddering , foot stamping . But if placing first in a single event and avoiding elimination requires only an act of swallowing , no matter how repugnant , then swallow he must . Between coughs and pats on the back , he describes the ordeal : " Horrible ... like carbonated stomach acid filtered through old coffee grounds . " Jacob hands him some celery soda as a palate cleanser . " A discriminating drinker , " Puck compliments . " You 've just experienced the refreshing taste of Diet Espresso Soda . Imported from Guatemala . And , " he continues , " by this achievement you 've managed to force a three-way tie . We were n't prepared for this , so now must devise a sudden-death round . " Semisincere groans from the contestants . Happy anticipation of the soda committee . Puck wonders briefly if he takes perhaps too much delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a wife . A fun-loving wife . From the tree swing Jacob can see Bell and Reese talking with his parents on the porch . He considers generations , and fast-forwards twenty or so years as the next one brings a new set of friends to this place . Same place , different time , no more or less present . Merrily merrily . At moments like this he waits . Tree , house viewed from a comprehending angle , passing clouds . A composing occurs , a spirit level is balanced . Then he is moving again , in this case indoors , to join the others , as Brent and Ronald return from their fifteen-mile cycle , sopping wet , smelly , hungry for victims . Ronald embraces Warren in revenge for the left-handed Civil War questions . Brent goes after Nia , who evades invitingly . She has carried a torch for Trey , but on this trip has come to enjoy Brent 's company , and down by the pond felt close to kissing . As she twists in his grasp , Jacob climbs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " Everyone is gathered in the front smoking room for the play-off round . BeD predicts it will be short and decisive . Puck announces , " The contestants will answer one question about Bell and Reese 's courtship . They first met when one of his housemates brought her to dinner unannounced . It was Bells night to cook and , as luck would have it , the night he chose to dramatize his housemates " negligence at grocery shopping . He made a casserole from among the limited supplies at his disposal . The question is : What were the two main ingredients of the casserole ?
