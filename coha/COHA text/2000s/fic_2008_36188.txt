The pain , God , the pain ! It 's going to splinter my skull ! <br> I clutch my head with wet , stinking hands , determined to hold it together until the inevitable occurs  --  I pass out . <br> Nothing compares to the agony the Sinsar Dubh causes me . Each time I get close to it , the same thing happens . I 'm immobilized by pain that escalates until I lose consciousness . <br> Barrons says it 's because the Dark Book and I are point and counterpoint . That it 's so evil , and I 'm so good , that it repels me violently . His theory is to " dilute " me somehow , make me a little evil so I can get close to it . I do n't see how making me evil so I can get close enough to pick up an evil book is a good thing . I think I 'd probably do evil things with it . <br> " No , " I whimper , sloshing on my knees in the puddle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now ! In the past , each time I 'd gotten close to the Book , Barrons had been with me , and I 'd had the comfort of knowing he would n't let anything too awful happen to my unconscious body . He might tote me around like a divining rod , but I could live with that . Tonight , however , I was alone . The thought of being vulnerable to anyone and anything in Dublin 's streets for even a few moments terrified me . What if I passed out for an hour ? What if I fell facedown into the vile puddle I was in , and drowned in mere inches of . . . ugh . <br> I had to get out of the puddle . I would not die so pathetically . <br> A wintry wind howled down the street , whipping between buildings , chilling me to the bone . Old newspapers cartwheeled like dirty , sodden tumbleweeds over broken bottles and discarded wrappers and glasses . I flailed in the sewage , scraped at the pavement with my fingernails , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones . <br> Inch by inch , I clawed my way to drier ground . <br> It was there  --  straight ahead of me : the Dark Book . I could feel it , fifty yards from where I scrabbled for purchase . Maybe less . And it was n't just a book . Oh , no . It was nothing that simple . It pulsated darkly , charring the edges of my mind . <br> Why was n't I passing out ? <br> Why would n't this pain end ? <br> I felt like I was dying . Saliva flooded my mouth , frothing into foam at my lips . I wanted desperately to throw up but I could n't . Even my stomach was locked down by pain . <br> Moaning , I tried to raise my head . I had to see it . I 'd been close to it before , but I 'd never seen it . I 'd always passed out first . If I was n't going to lose consciousness , I had questions I wanted answered . I did n't even know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they doing with it ? Why did I keep having near brushes with it ? <br> Shuddering , I pushed back onto my knees , shoved a hank of sour-smelling hair from my face , and looked . <br> The street that only moments ago had bustled with tourists , making their merry way from one open pub door to the next , was now scourged clean by the dark , arctic wind . Doors had been slammed , music silenced . <br> Leaving only me . <br> And them . <br> The vision before me was not at all what I 'd expected . <br> A gunman had a huddle of people backed against the wall of a building , a family of tourists , cameras swinging around their necks . The barrel of a semiautomatic weapon gleamed in the moonlight . The father was yelling , the mother was screaming , trying to gather three small children into her arms . <br> " No ! " I shouted . At least I think I did . I 'm not sure I actually made a sound . My lungs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray of bullets , silencing their cries . He killed the youngest last  --  a delicate blond girl of four or five , with wide , pleading eyes that would haunt me till the day I died . A girl I could n't save because I could n't fecking move . Paralyzed by pain-deadened limbs , I could only kneel there , screaming inside my head . <br> Why was this happening ? Where was the Sinsar Dubh ? Why could n't I see it ? <br> The man turned , and I inhaled sharply . <br> A book was tucked beneath his arm . <br> A perfectly innocuous hardcover , about three hundred and fifty pages thick , no dust jacket , pale gray with red binding . The kind of well-read hardcover you might find in any used bookstore , in any city . <br> I gaped . Was I supposed to believe that was the million-year-old book of the blackest magic imaginable , scribed by the Unseelie King ? Was this supposed to be funny ? How anticlimactic . How absurd . <br> The gunman glanced at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back toward the fallen bodies , the blood and bits of flesh and bone spattered across the brick wall . <br> The book dropped from beneath his arm . It seemed to fall in slow motion , changing , transforming , as it tumbled , end over end , to the damp , shiny brick . By the time it hit the cobbled pavement with a heavy whump , it was no longer a simple hardcover but a massive black tome , nearly a foot thick , engraved with runes , bound by bands of steel and intricate locks . Exactly the kind of book I 'd expected : ancient and evil-looking . <br> I sucked in another breath . <br> Now the thick dark volume was changing again , becoming something new . It swirled and spun , drawing substance from wind and darkness . <br> In its place rose a . . . thing . . . of such . . . terrible essence and pitch . A darkly animate . . . again , I can only say thing . . . that existed beyond shape or name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanity and broken gibberings . <br> And it lived . <br> I have no words to describe it , because nothing exists in our world to compare it to . I 'm glad nothing exists in our world to compare it to , because if something did exist in our world to compare it to , I 'm not sure our world would exist . <br> I can only call it the Beast , and leave it there . <br> My soul shivered , as if perceiving on some visceral level that my body was not nearly enough protection for it . Not from this . <br> The gunman looked at it , and it looked at the gunman , and he turned his weapon on himself . I jerked at the sound of more shots . The shooter crumpled to the pavement and his weapon clattered away . <br> Another icy wind gusted down the street , and there was movement in my periphery . <br> A woman appeared from around the corner as if answering a summons , gazed blankly at the scene for several moments , then walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast with impossible limbs and bloodied muzzle ! ) that abruptly sported neither ancient locks or bestial form but was once again masquerading as an innocent hardcover . <br> " Do n't touch it ! " I cried , goose bumps needling my flesh at the thought . <br> She stooped , picked it up , tucked it beneath her arm , and turned away . <br> I 'd like to say she walked off without a backward glance , but she did n't . She glanced over her shoulder , straight at me , and her expression choked off what little breath inflated my lungs . <br> Pure evil stared out of her eyes , a cunning , bottomless malevolence that knew me , that understood things about me I did n't , and never wanted to know . Evil that celebrated its existence every chance it got through chaos , demolition , and psychotic rage . <br> She smiled , an awful smile , baring hundreds of small , pointy teeth . <br> And I had one of those sudden epiphanies . <br> I remembered the last time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reading the next day about the man who 'd killed his entire family , then driven himself into an embankment , mere blocks from where I 'd lost consciousness . Everyone interviewed had said the same thing  --  the man could n't have done it , it was n't him , he 'd been behaving like someone possessed for the past few days . I recalled the rash of gruesome news articles lately that echoed the same sentiment , whatever the brutal crime  --  it was n't him/her ; he/she would never do it . I stared at the woman who was no longer who or what she 'd been when she 'd turned the corner and entered this street . A woman possessed . And I understood . <br> It was n't those people committing the terrible crimes . <br> The Beast was inside her now , in control . And it would retain control of her until it was done using her , when it would dispose of her and move on to its next victim . <br> We 'd been so wrong , Barrons and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possession of someone with a cogent plan who was transporting it from place to place with a purpose , someone who was either using it to accomplish certain goals or guarding it , trying to keep it from falling into the wrong hands . <br> But it was n't in the possession of anyone with a plan , cogent or otherwise , and it was n't being moved . <br> It was moving . <br> Passing from one set of hands to the next , transforming each of its victims into a weapon of violence and destruction . Barrons had told me that Fae relics had a tendency to take on a life and purpose of their own in time . The Dark Book was a million years old . That was a lot of time . It had certainly taken on some kind of life . <br> The woman disappeared around the corner , and I dropped to the pavement like a stone . Eyes closed , I gasped for shallow breaths . As she/it moved farther away , vanishing into the night where God only knew what she/it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> It was the most dangerous Hallow ever created  --  and it was loose in our world . <br> Creepy thing was , until tonight , it had n't been aware of me . <br> It was now . <br> It had looked at me , seen me . I could n't explain it , but I felt it had somehow marked me , tagged me like a pigeon . I 'd gazed into the abyss and the abyss had gazed back , just like Daddy always said it would : You want to know about life , Mac ? It 's simple . Keep watching rainbows , baby . Keep looking at the sky . You find what you look for . If you go hunting good in the world , you 'll find it . If you go hunting evil . . . well , do n't . <br> What idiot , I brooded , as I dragged myself up onto the sidewalk , had decided to give me special powers ? What fool thought I could do something about problems of such enormity ? How could I not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could see it ? <br> Tourists were flooding back into the street . Pub doors opened . Darkness peeled back . Music began playing , and the world started up again . Laughter bounced off brick . I wondered what world they were living in . It sure was n't mine . <br> Oblivious to them all , I threw up until I dry-heaved . Then I dry-heaved until not even bile remained . <br> I pushed to my feet , dragged the back of my hand across my mouth , and stared at my reflection in a pub window . I was stained , I was soaked , and I smelled . My hair was a soppy mess of beer and . . . oh ! I could n't bear to think about what else . You never know what you 'll find in a gutter in Dublin 's party district . I plucked the clip from my hair , scraped it back , and secured it at my nape where it could n't touch much of my face . <br> My dress was torn , I was missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken the heel off my right shoe , and my knees were scraped and bleeding . <br> " There 's a lass that gives a whole new meaning to falling-down drunk , eh ? " A man sniggered as he passed by . His buddies laughed . There were a dozen of them , wearing red cummerbunds and bow ties over jeans and sweaters . A bachelor party , off to celebrate the joy of testosterone . They gave me wide berth . <br> They were so clueless . <br> Continues ...
