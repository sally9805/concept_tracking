You know people like me . I 'm the one who sat on a folding chair out in the hall with a cigar box on my lap , selling tickets to the prom , but never going even though in the late sixties only nerds went to proms . But I would have gone . I would have happily gone ; I would have been so happy . I wanted the phone call with the rough voice asking " Would you ... ? " I wanted to finger row after row of pastel dresses in silks and chiffons their sweetheart necks , their wide ribbon ties . I wanted to have some shoes dyed ; I thought it was a miracle they could do it . I wanted to put a wrist corsage in my refrigerator , lock the bathroom door , and bathe in perfumed water with rollers in my hair and the transistor at the edge of the sink blaring " Sugar Pie , Honey Bunch . " I wanted to allow an hour for the application of all my new Maybelline , suffer the flash-bulbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , and eat breakfast before I came home , bleary-eyed and in the know . I did n't get asked . I never once got asked . Not to proms , not to lesser dances , not to movies , not to parties , not for shopping with the girls . I would get talked to , though . I mean beyond the " Hi ! " s in the hall , beyond the preoccupied chatter in the lunchroom . I got talked to a lot . They would call me on the phone , the pretty girls . They would call and talk to me about things that were serious : their parents ' alcoholism . Their hidden scoliosis . Their possible pregnancies . They talked to me because I knew how to listen , and I gave good advice . I did n't have a lot of personal experience , but I knew things , because I read and I watched . That is what there was for me . Those girls talked to me and a boy , once , too because they knew I would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they did n't really mean to . Probably they did n't know . They did n't think about it that much . I 'm the one everybody liked , Myra Lipinski , oh yeah , Myra , she 's nice , the one that everybody liked and no one wanted to be with . The odd shape . The socks , those socks well , her parents had accents . The face , unfortunate , with its too small eyes , its too wide mouth . The hair mousy brown , too thin and straight , greasy after half a day , no matter what . Even as a five-year-old : the aunt and uncle who once came to visit , sitting with my mother at the kitchen table , chatting quietly in Polish , and smiling over at me . " What are they saying ? " I asked my mother , coming over to stretch myself out across her lap and shyly smiling back at them . " What are they saying about me ? " And my mother finally breaking into English to tell me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we are not anymore talking about you . " I lay still in her lap , contemplating the yellow-and-orange pattern of her apron and forbidding myself my thumb , until she crossed her legs and dislodged me . So . I sold the tickets and I decorated the gym and I helped win the volleyball games and I sang a good alto in the choir and I lent my notes to anyone who asked ; and if people wanted to copy from my test paper , I let them do that , too . I did not become bitter . I do n't know why . Maybe I did n't think I had the right . After graduation , I stayed here in Ashton , venturing no further than the twenty-two miles necessary to get to Boston College , where I earned my BSN . I went to nursing school because I knew it would be a way for people to love me . And for me to love them , too . This happens in illness . The sad plates of armor separate ; the light comes in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted the challenge and the prestige of working in the hardest place . You 're eating lunch in the cafeteria , wearing your scrubs , your high-tech stethoscope around your neck , a hemostat clipped onto you somewhere , tourniquets tied onto it . You know a long list of lab values cold ; you could intubate if you had to ; you can rate heart murmurs and evaluate lung status and draw blood and start IVs better than most of the attending physicians . You see a burst of ventricular tachycardia race across a monitor screen and you save the patient and let the doctor know about it when you get around to it . You can give a lot of drugs that nurses on other floors ca n't . You can decide when to get certain kinds of tests performed . When you call down to any other department in the hospital and say , " This is ICU , " they pay attention . You come first . When you say stat , it gets done stat . So you 're eating lunch and a code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run back to the unit . It 's likely you 'll be needed , no matter where in the hospital the arrest occurred . The other people in the cafeteria watch you leave your bowl of soup sitting there , and they nod at you as you pass by . In the army of nurses , you wear four stars . The pay is pretty good , too , especially for a single woman with no obligations only child with no children , parents dead . I bought a little two-bedroom house a couple of blocks from the center of town . I bought a Porsche Carrera 911 , too . Black , tan leather interior . Incredible sound system . The boys look when I pull up next to them ; then look away . I beat them off the line , every time . The problem with intensive care is that the patients usually ca n't speak . They 're on respirators . Or they 're unconscious . Or they have such messed up chemistry that they 're confused . Or they stay just until they 're stabilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train wreck comes in . That 's what the bad cases are called : train wrecks . It does n't mean what it sounds like . What it means is : right now , I ca n't get close to you , you 're halfway to death . And anyway , I do n't have time . So there 's no opportunity , in the unit , to sit at the side of the bed and shoot the breeze with patients . To get to know them . To admire pictures of their children , to style their hair , to slowly help them eat . Not that many of them eat . Tubes . I know a nurse who works in the unit precisely because the patients do n't eat . " I did n't go to four years of nursing school to load mashed potatoes onto a fork , " she says . But I like feeding people . It does n't feel demeaning . It feels like high privilege . The best day I had in the unit came when we had a boarder , someone who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was full . She ate . She sat up in a chair . She was oriented to time , place , and person . She dug in her purse for lipstick after her bath . The unit was light that day ; she was my only patient . She told me she had a crush on her doctor no surprise , everyone had a crush on Dr. LaGuardia , with his dark , South American looks so I told her I 'd curl her hair , and she 'd look beautiful when he came to visit her . We used 4 x 4 gauze pads to make rag rollers , and she did look beautiful when he came . I stopped him outside her cubicle , told him to be sure he noticed her hairdo . He 's a good guy , Dr. LaGuardia . He walked in the room and stopped dead in his tracks . " Where was the beauty contest ? " he asked , in the accent you could feel in your knees . " Where 's the trophy ? " Then he told her she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed available ; and twenty minutes later I was taking care of a gray-faced man with multisystem failure . I stayed working in the unit for a long time . I mixed drugs , counted drops , monitored machines , resuscitated people who arrested , then resuscitated them again when they arrested half an hour later . I rarely had enough time to talk to their distraught family members . I had to walk away from their sad , worried clusters ; I had to go and milk chest tubes while they wept and talked in church-quiet voices . Oftentimes , I worked in my dreams . I heard the beep-beep of the IV telling me the infusion was completed , the rhythmic sighs of the ventilator , the dull bong of the alarm on the heart monitor . I changed dressings in my sleep , emptied urine and bile and drainage from wounds into toilets , sent polyps and kidney stones and spinal fluid to the pathology lab . I tested feces for blood , tested urine for blood , tested vomit for blood , kept track of each ounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , monitored levels of consciousness , listened to lungs , to hearts , to various levels of activity in the four quadrants of the abdomen . I awakened after those nights feeling exhausted , feeling like I 'd just put in eight hours at the hospital after having just put in eight hours at the hospital . Or nine . Or sixteen . These days I work for a Boston agency called Protemp , as a visiting nurse . When I was hired , I asked for easy patients ; I was tired of high acuity levels . Now that I 've been there for ten years , I do n't think I could hear a heart murmur if it were as loud as sandpaper on sandpaper . But I 'm happy . And when I sleep now , I am back to dreaming only gauzy mysteries . I have some clients I see daily : Rose Banovitz , who lives in a seedy area on Commonwealth Avenue and needs her morning dose of insulin , and who often sings to me in her high , quivery voice . Fitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure and his wildly erratic heartbeat in order to determine his dose of Nitropaste . He goes to strip clubs every night , Fitz , though he is blind . The Schwartzes live in the heart of Brookline and need weekly visits to supervise their medications and to keep them from killing each other . Another once-a-weeker , a black woman in Dorchester appropriately named Marvelous , I will keep on seeing even after I 'm no longer paid to help her with her colostomy . I also see one DeWitt Washington , because nobody else will put up with the combination of his personality and his neighborhood in Roxbury . I have to go every afternoon and change the dressing on his gunshot wound . I give eyedrops daily to a rich woman in Back Bay , Ann Peters , who ca n't see to do it herself and whose family ca n't be bothered . And since last week , I 've been going to Allston to see a fifteen-year-old girl named Grace to help her with the baby she just had . I gave her my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . Things like , " Okay . His shit looks exactly like scrambled eggs . No way is this normal . All I do is fuck up , and he do n't even cry . Can you call me ? Sorry for the swears , can you please call ? " You know the boy who once called me in high school ? That was Chip Reardon . He called because he knew I had been talking to his girlfriend , Diann Briedenbach . They were having trouble . He wanted advice , some inside information . He felt comfortable asking me we 'd had a lot of classes together and he knew how carefully I observed things . Once , in fact , after an essay of mine had been read aloud in English , he stopped me after class to compliment me on my perceptiveness . I treasured that small event , carried the memory of it home from school like a wrapped gift . I even decided , foolishly , that had the bell not rung , that conversation might have led to something more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' full-length mirror , wondering if I 'd finally worn something right , something that would make a boy like him really see a girl like me . I 'd worn the same outfit a week later , down to the same color tie to hold my hair back , but of course nothing happened . Anyway , when he called that night I told him only that he should n't worry , Diann loved him , I knew that for certain . He thanked me , though it seemed to me that his relief was not so great . But then I decided I was only making that up , trying to make him less invested in her than he really was . After we hung up , I put my fingers to the place his voice had come from . As there is one of me in every high school , there is one of Chip Reardon , too . Other end of the spectrum . Every girl 's dream boy . The handsome star athlete with a good head on his shoulders , too . And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went west . That 's what he said , to keep from bragging about Stanford nobody from Ashton High had ever gotten in there . But now he 's back here . I know because I got a message from my agency , asking if I could possibly fit in another client . A man called Chip Reardon . Fifty-one years old . Brain tumor , end stage , apparently ; not too much to do . Probably home to die he 'd only need comfort measures . I called my agency back . I said , yes , I could take another patient . They told me it would be daily visits at first , starting tomorrow . Then they told me where his parents , with whom he would be staying , lived . It was in the south part of town , a newer , wealthy area that is in marked contrast to the rest of this mostly blue-collar area . It 's too far to walk to the hardware store from there , to the library or the bakery or the common ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lovely stone walls , their rolling hills and peaceful populations of sheep and cows . I wrote down his nice address and his terrible diagnosis , entered it next to the 2:00 P.M. slot for Wednesday . And you know something bad ? You know something bad about me ? When I wrote that , I felt happy . I thought only one thing . I thought , Good . Now I can have him . Not that you should think I have n't had my moments . I have had my moments . Some . Moments . You know , the blind date with the guy whose face at first turns in on itself when he sees what he got . But particularly after age forty-five , one can make do . One adult female can offer a certain kind of comfort to one adult male . And although they did n't usually stay the night only two ever stayed the night I was glad for that . After my rare interludes , I actually prefer a sandwich alone at my own kitchen table . I know I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alternating bites of pickle with my ham and cheese , turning the pages of the Chambers catalog and finding the one thing I 'll let myself order that 's much better than the smiley conversations I endure when they stay . The awkward partings in the morning , the indignity of picking the guy 's hair from my sink when I know I 'll never see him again . Better to eat the sandwich and then look to see if any Mary Tyler Moores are on where Mary still lives in the old apartment . The only thing wrong with that show is that they acted like Rhoda was unattractive . People think women like me should settle . That we should not aspire to certain things . Well , I had a crush on Chip Reardon , too , just like all the other girls . I had a full-time longing that went beyond the brief fantasy I enjoyed that day after English class . I saw him kissing me . I was not a different person when I imagined this ; I saw him kissing me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd snort their disapproval . They wanted me to have a crush on the guy equivalent of me . But of course I did n't . No one did . I did n't want Thomas Osterhout , him with his horrible posture and his stick-out Adam 's apple and dandruff dusting the shoulders of black knit shirts tucked into his high-waisted pants I did n't want him any more than he wanted me . Probably Thomas kissed Diann in his dreams , rode her around in his battered Gremlin while all the jocks stared , their fists shoved into their pockets . Mostly , I have a dog . Do n't laugh . Take a look at marriages that have survived a long time and see if it 's the dog or the spouse that offers a better package to either partner . The dog ca n't call the internist for you ; he ca n't accompany you out to dinner or to a show . But he will lie by you the whole time you 're sick , and he will listen to every word you say and offer nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , is an eighty-five-pound golden mix , selected from the suffering souls at the dog pound . He sat quietly in the corner of his concrete cell , asking for nothing . When I stopped in front of his dank space , he walked up to me and sat down . Looked up . Held my gaze and waited . " This one , " I told the overworked attendant . Frank walked out into the office on the leash I 'd brought with me , lifted his leg apologetically against the desk where I filled out the necessary forms , and never again had an accident . Usually , he sleeps smack up against the side of my bed , quiet as a shadow , except on the nights he has dreams then he whines through his nose in a way that sounds like a story . Other nights , he senses a need and he jumps up to stretch out next to me . He lies on his side , his back to me . I put my arm around his middle , push up next to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paws . It 's enough , work and Frank . Or at least it has been , until now .
