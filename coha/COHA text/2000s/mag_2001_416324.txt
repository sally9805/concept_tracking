FIVE years ago , he was a down-and-out semi-pro football player who slept on a dirty mattress and had only $7 to his name . Today , at the tender age of 29 , Dwayne Douglas Johnson ( aka the Rock ) is one of the most recognizable athletes since Michael Jordan . His image is plastered on everything from T-shirts and Web sites to Halloween masks . He has penned a New York Times best seller , The Rock Says ... , and reportedly earns $15 million a year . He is currently featured in Universal 's The Mummy Returns as the villainous assassin Scorpion King , and is also starring in the scheduled prequel to the Mummy series , The Scorpion King . The word in Hollywood is that the sculpted , athletic sex symbol is America 's next great action hero . But the world is not enough for the wrestling icon , who is well aware of the highly publicized transition of professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the Minnesota governor 's mansion , and who could end up in politics as well . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Rock is synonymous with president , " he says , adding : " I might win a race or two . I would make an entertaining president . Hey , people , vote for me and I 'll lay the smackdown on taxes ! " Laying " the smackdown " is what the Rock does best . At 6-foot-4 and 270 pounds , he is mountainous and mesmerizing . And when he enters a sports arena , wearing nothing but black boots , black briefs , and the signature Brahma Bull ( after his zodiac sign , Taurus ) tattoo on his 22-inch bicep , the crowd of wrestling fans ( especially the throngs of women ) goes wild . For the Rock and his fans , wrestling is entertainment , and he is known for taking the excitement to the next level . Some women clap until their hands ache . Others chant his name until they 're hoarse . Still others spend much of the night bobbing and weaving through the crowd , trying to get a more intimate glimpse of him . The Rock has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female fan quotient , and when he meets his femme fans in person , they claw at him , hug him , throw kisses and , many times , cry .

" I see what I look like in the morning , when my hair is half an afro and leaning to the side , " he says . " So I do n't consider myself a sex symbol . " The Rock came by his wrestling credentials earnestly and honestly . He 's a third-generation wrestler , born of a Samoan mom , Ata Maivia , and the Black wrestling great Rocky Johnson .

They taught the once feisty and uncontrolled teen a healthy work ethic , survival skills and the method behind the madness of wrestling . They taught him to funnel his spurts of anger and anxiety in a positive fashion . But perhaps the most important lesson they taught him was how to embrace two heritages without abandoping either one . Unlike some biracial celebrities who deny one race or the other when it 's convenient or popular , the Rock 's fan-base-which includes hip-hoppers , little old White ladies and every group in between-is not an ode to marketing savvy ; instead his enviable crossover success is proof that the wrestling champ keeps it real . Throughout his career , the Rock has managed to uphold and celebrate his Black and Samoan heritages simultaneously . " When he was a child , Dwayne asked me what he was , and I told him , " says Rocky Johnson . " And I taught him to appreciate and represent the Black race because that 's what I did . " The son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sure footing in the Black community . Early on in his World Wrestling Federation career he joined " The Nation of Domination , " as he describes it , a " hard-core , militant Black group ofl bad guys . " Today he performs with rap stars like Method Man and Wyclef Jean , and is this/close with acclaimed actor Michael Clarke Duncan of The Green Mile , who 's also starring in The Scorpion King . Photograph Inside the ring ( left ) , The Rock 's talent and style have made him " the most entertaining man in sports entertainment . " The World Wrestling Federation star , who is a huge crowd favorite , is exhibiting more of his talents in movies , starring in such films ( below ) as The Mummy Returns . // And like many other minorities , the Rock has had painful brushes with racism . In fact , he says that his wife 's parents did n't consider him the best choice for their daughter , mainly because he was half-Black . " Her parents were Cuban immigrants who were adamant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always the first language in their home . They wanted their children to assimilate , adapt and succeed . What they did not want was their daughter dating me , a person of color . I was half-Black , and that made me an unsuitable suitor . " The Rock dated financial consultant Dany Garcia , 32 , for a full six years and did n't meet her parents formally until he informed Dany 's father that the two planned to marry . Love prevailed for the college sweethearts , who were wed in May of 1997 , with her parents ' blessing . Today the couple exists in a long-distance relationship because the wrestler is on the road for up to 200 days out of the year . They share a home in Miami , and to keep the love strong , The Rock says he turns his homecomings into honeymoons every time . " We 've spoken every day for the last 10 years , since we officially started dating , " he says . " No matter where I am , I call .

Born in Hayward Calif. , he later attended Freedom High School in Bethlehem Pennsylvania , where he was involved in boxing , running track and playing football .

" When it comes to fighting and getting women , I was way ahead of the curve . " By the time the confident teen entered his freshman year of college he had learned first-hand what it is to be poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that point in his life , the wrestler , notorious for his on-air arrogance , was wracked by a seemingly endless cycle of failure and self-doubt . He attended the University of Miami and was a defensive lineman on the football team , but when he got injured , he says he discovered " how unimportant injured players are to the team . " Injured and ignored , he slid into a destructive routine of heavy drinking and cutting classes . With an embarrassing 0.7 gradepoint average , he was placed on academic probation . But before he hit rock bottom , he found the will and inner-strength to improve both his academic and athletic performance . He graduated with a degree in physiology and criminology , but he was snubbed by the NFL and signed a contract with the Canadian Football League , a last-ditch effort to get discovered by the NFL . The Rock says his life in Canada was the closest thing to hell on earth . His peace of mind-his woman-was on the other side of the world . His plate of food was soggy pasta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he scammed from team meetings that he was n't required to attend . And his home was a shoddy apartment ( he slept on a soiled mattress he found in a hotel dumpster ) , which he shared with other teammates . But Dwayne Johnson was determined to succeed and he stuck it out-that is , until he was abruptly cut from the Canadian team . After receiving the bad news , he went to the nearest pay phone and told his dad that his football career was over and that he wanted to reconnect with his wrestling roots . " That was hard , " he says thoughtfully . " I left home when I was 18 , and now I 'm 23 , and I need money and I have to start all over again . I was supposed to be reaping the fruits of my labor , and there I was in Canada , just struggling . " Rocky Johnson agreed to train his son after much debate ( he says he did n't want his son to go through the trials and pain that he experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy on the mat . " I yelled at him , and told him that he was going to have to give 150 percent , " Rocky Johnson says . " And he did . He worked very hard . And now you see the product . " The " product " is a proud and journeyed man , an old soul who has a maturity in his eyes well beyond his 29 years on earth . He is also a man with two faces . Inside the ring , he is " The People 's Champion " the arrogant , feisty , profane and unapologetic professional wrestler . Outside the ring , he is Dwayne , the Rock 's alter ego , an affable , genuinely humble , respectful and alluring gentleman . " I taught my son that when he 's inside the ring , he 's The Rock , and anything goes , " says father Rocky Johnson . " But outside the ring he 's Dwayne Johnson , and to always remember that . " Away from the ring , the clamoring crowds , and the glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or in wrestlers terms , he 's more of the babyface ( good guy ) than the heel ( bad guy ) that he portrays on television . His eyes light up when he talks about his fans , he blushes upon the mere mention of his wife , and he 's a social activist who publicly joined the fight against two of society 's major ills-AIDS and racism . In his spare time , he enjoys singing Sam Cooke songs ( he sings quite well , actually ) watching Johnny Bravo cartoons , playing video games , and telling unsavory jokes that would have made even Redd Foxx wince . And of course , he 's inseparable from his mom . In a nutshell , the truth about The Rock is that he 's a man 's man , who 's also a mama 's boy . The Rock is also a work in progress . Despite the money , the movies , the fame and the fans , he says there is much more that he 's out to conquer . " My work , my goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no " stop " button on my treadmill , " he says . " Once I get on , I just keep going and going . I want to do more in the WWF I want to do more in the movie industry . Ultimately , I want to be the most electrifying man in sports entertainment , period . " Photograph Looking ahead , The Rock says he wants to continue evolving as a wrestler and actor . " In the ring we 're able to tell a story every single night . " he says . " In movies , it 's nothing greater than telling these elongated stories in such great detail . " // <p>
