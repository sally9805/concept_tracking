// Is Kalaupapa the world 's most isolated spot ? That 's what Hawaii 's King Kamehameha V thought in 1865 , when he signed a law banishing people with advanced stages of leprosy ( now called Hansen 's Disease ) to the north shore of the island of Molokai . Rough seas and 2,000-foot cliffs still keep the Kalaupapa peninsula fairly isolated today , although the remote place has acquired some name recognition , thanks to the courageous young priest who volunteered to go minister to this " leper colony " more than 100 years ago . The Belgian priest Father Damien De Veuster was declared blessed by the church in 1995 . What few people realize , however , is that Father Damien 's work continues in the 21st century . Three Franciscan sisters  --  Frances Therese Souza , Dativa Padilla , and Richard Marie Toal  --  tend the remaining 44 patients who live at Kalaupapa today , ministering to their physical , emotional , and spiritual needs . The settlement on the peninsula appears much as any peaceful suburban community , except that two vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . Wind , lapping waves , birdcalls , and the barking of a dog are the only sounds . Food , supplies , and visitors are flown in on small planes from Molokai and Honolulu , depending on the winds . Larger items like refrigerators and cars come once a year by barge . Otherwise , the steep trail on the cliffs is navigable only by mules or on foot . Photograph More than 100 years ago , Father Damien De Veuster ( whose tomb is shown here in Kalawao ) volunteered to minister to the lepers on the Kalaupapa peninsula in Hawaii . Today , Sister Dativa Padilla ( at left ) and two other Franciscan sisters carry on his work caring for patients with what is now called Hansen 's Disease . // The youngest patient at Kalaupapa was born in 1941 . In 1969 , Hawaii 's century-old isolation laws were abolished . Those who have chosen to remain do so for a variety of reasons , including persistent public ignorance about the disease and an insensitivity to their feelings .

Today , most people who suffer from Hansen 's Disease are treated as outpatients with sulphone drugs , which became available in 1947 . But the disease remains a public health problem in 24 countries , and it is estimated by the World Health Organization that about 2.5 million new patients will be diagnosed between 2000 and 2005 . Over the past 15 years , 10 million leprosy patients have been cured ; deformities preceding this treatment , however , can not be reversed . The drugs are administered orally or by injection , but patients must be monitored by trained personnel because complications can occur .

During their 12-hour hospital rotations , they care for patients with the assistance of nurses from the Hawaii Department of Health and a visiting doctor , dentist , ophthalmologist , and orthopedic specialist who make regular visits to the settlement . Hansen 's Disease is not the only affliction the sisters treat . As in any community , there is the gamut of " ordinary " medical challenges , such as heart and kidney disease , respiratory and circulatory problems , diabetes , cuts and scrapes , shingles , toothaches , and " everything but births . " " In 20 years here , I have never been bored , " says Padilla . The sisters also handle administrative paperwork and reports , vehicle maintenance , gardening , craft projects , andwith Father Joseph Hendricks-provide spiritual support to the community . Toal , who served for 37 years in Kalaupapa , chose to remain there in her retirement . " I wanted to be here from the time I was in eighth grade , " she says . The sisters draw inspiration from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry , including Father Damien and Mother Marianne Cope , who led the first sister-nurses to the island and to whom Father Damien entrusted his work after his death . Father Damien 's hagiography contains stories about his compassion toward the sick and suffering people he eventually came to call " my fellow lepers . " It is said that he never hesitated to dress their wounds , share their meals , or bury them . This in a time when the afflicted were considered " unclean " and " outcasts . " Mother Marianne shunned publicity and thus is not as well known as Father Damien , whose own leprosy brought him prominence whether he wanted it or not . The former provincial of the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis of Syracuse , New York , she had already founded Maui 's first hospital and a hospital for victims of leprosy near Honolulu when she responded to Father Damien 's plea for help . On Kalaupapa , she started a home for homeless women and children and worked beside Father Damien until his death in 1889 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was also known for her regime of dignity , order , and cleanliness , requiring handwashing between treatment of patients , which did much to lessen contagion . She predicted that no sister would contract leprosy at Kalaupapa , and none ever has . Mother Marianne 's presence is still felt at Bishop Home , where the sisters live surrounded by portraits of her in several rooms . Padilla says , " Mother helps me do my work " and credits Mother Marianne with helping her to heal after recent surgery , " to continue the work . " Death is a constant part of life at Kalaupapa ; the area of graves is nearly as large as that of residences . A man points to the cemetery and explains , " These are my friends , this is my uncle , this is my cousin ... " His use of the present tense suggests that his friends , uncle , cousin , and others are still with him , still part of the community .
