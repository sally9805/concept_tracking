<p> NOT all reporters have an unfinished novel gathering dust but many , including this one , do . If that is n't enough of a cliche , this novel 's hero is a television anchor ( always plant your pen in familiar turf ) who , in the course of a minor traffic accident , bites the tip off his tongue . The ensuing speech impediment is sufficient to end his on-air career and he finds himself , recently divorced , now unemployed , at home and watching altogether too much television . <p> After several weeks of isolation he discovers on his voice mail a message from an old friend , the opinion-page editor of his hometown newspaper . She is urging him to write a piece about television news , which , after some hesitation , he does  --  with a vengeance : <p> The earls and dukes and barons of television news have grown sleek and fat eating road kill . The victims , dispatched by political or special interest hit-and-run squads , are then hung up , displayed and consumed with unwholesome relish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's wars , these knights of the airwaves , disposing of the wounded from both armies , gorging themselves like the electronic vultures they are . <p> The popular illusion that television journalists are liberals does them too much honor . Like all mercenaries they fight for money , not ideology ; but unlike true mercenaries , their loyalty is not for sale . It can not be engaged because it does not exist . Their total lack of commitment to any cause has come to be defined as objectivity . Their daily preoccupation with the trivial and the banal has accumulated large audiences , which , in turn , has encouraged a descent into the search for items of even greater banality . <p> A wounded and bitter fellow , this fictional hero of mine , but his bilious arguments hardly seem all that dated . Now here I sit , having recently left ABC News after 42 years , and who should call but an editor friend of mine who , in a quirky convolution of real life 's imitating unpublished fiction , has asked me to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Where to begin ? Confession of the obvious seems like a reasonable starting point : I have become well known and well-off traveling the world on ABC 's dime , charged only with ensuring that our viewers be well informed about important issues . For the better part of those 42 years , this arrangement worked to our mutual benefit and satisfaction . At the same time , I can not help but see that the industry in which I have spent my entire adult life is in decline and in distress . <p> Once , 30 or 40 years ago , the target audience for network news was made up of everyone with a television , and the most common criticism lodged against us was that we were tempted to operate on a **25;785;TOOLONG basis . <p> This , however , was in the days before deregulation , when the Federal Communications Commission was still perceived to have teeth , and its mandate that broadcasters operate in " the public interest , convenience and necessity " was enough to give each licensee pause . <p> Network owners nurtured their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivated them as shields to be brandished before Congressional committees whenever questions were raised about the quality of entertainment programs and the vast sums earned by those programs . News divisions occasionally came under political pressures but rarely commercial ones . The expectation was that they would search out issues of importance , sift out the trivial and then tell the public what it needed to know . <p> With the advent of cable , satellite and broadband technology , today 's marketplace has become so overcrowded that network news divisions are increasingly vulnerable to the dictatorship of the demographic . Now , every division of every network is expected to make a profit . And so we have entered the age of boutique journalism . The goal for the traditional broadcast networks now is to identify those segments of the audience considered most desirable by the advertising community and then to cater to them . <p> Most television news programs are therefore designed to satisfy the perceived appetites of our audiences . That may be not only acceptable but unavoidable in entertainment ; in news , however , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , not the other way around . <p> Indeed , in television news these days , the programs are being shaped to attract , most particularly , 18-to-34-year-old viewers . They , in turn , are presumed to be partly brain-dead  --  though not so insensible as to be unmoved by the blandishments of sponsors . <p> Exceptions , it should be noted , remain . Thus it is that the evening news broadcasts of ABC , CBS and NBC are liberally studded with advertisements that clearly cater to older Americans . But this is a holdover from another era : the last gathering of more than 30 million tribal elders , as they clench their dentures while struggling to control esophageal eruptions of stomach acid to watch " The News . " That number still commands respect , but even the evening news programs , you will find ( after the first block of headline material ) , are struggling to find a new format that will somehow appeal to younger viewers . <p> Washington news , for example , is covered with less and less enthusiasm and aggressiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years now , been seen as too expensive to merit survival . Judged on the frequency with which their reports get airtime , they can no longer be deemed cost-effective . Most have either been closed or reduced in size to the point of irrelevance . <p> Simply stated , no audience is perceived to be clamoring for foreign news , the exceptions being wars in their early months that involve American troops , acts of terrorism and , for a couple of weeks or so , natural disasters of truly epic proportions . <p> You will still see foreign stories on the evening news broadcasts , but examine them carefully . They are either reported by one of a half-dozen or so remaining foreign correspondents who now cover the world for each network , or the anchor simply narrates a piece of videotape shot by some other news agency . For big events , an anchor might parachute in for a couple of days of high drama coverage . But the age of the foreign correspondent , who knew a country or region intimately , is long over . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major events overseas or in our nation 's capital , but he may , on occasion , concede that the viewers do n't care , and therein lies the essential malignancy . <p> The accusation that television news has a political agenda misses the point . Right now , the main agenda is to give people what they want . It is not partisanship but profitability that shapes what you see . <p> Most particularly on cable news , a calculated subjectivity has , indeed , displaced the old-fashioned goal of conveying the news dispassionately . But that , too , has less to do with partisan politics than simple capitalism . Thus , one cable network experiments with the subjectivity of tender engagement : " I care and therefore you should care . " Another opts for chest-thumping certitude : " I know and therefore you should care . " <p> Even Fox News 's product has less to do with ideology and more to do with changing business models . Fox has succeeded financially because it tapped into a deep , rich vein of unfulfilled yearning among conservative American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , not the other way around . CNN , meanwhile , finds itself largely outmaneuvered , unwilling to accept the label of liberal alternative , experimenting instead with a form of journalism that stresses empathy over detachment . <p> Now , television news should not become a sort of intellectual broccoli to be jammed down our viewers ' unwilling throats . We are obliged to make our offerings as palatable as possible . But there are too many important things happening in the world today to allow the diet to be determined to such a degree by the popular tastes of a relatively narrow and apparently uninterested demographic . <p> What is , ultimately , most confusing about the behavior of the big three networks is why they ever allowed themselves to be drawn onto a battlefield that so favors their cable competitors . At almost any time , the audience of a single network news program on just one broadcast network is greater than the combined audiences of CNN , Fox and MSNBC . <p> Reaching across the entire spectrum of American television viewers is precisely the broadcast networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by choosing to ignore their total viewership , they have surrendered their greatest advantage . <p> Oddly enough , there is a looming demographic reality that could help steer television news back toward its original purpose . There are tens of millions of baby boomers in their 40 's and 50 's and entering their 60 's who have far more spending power than their 18-to-34-year-old counterparts . Television news may be debasing itself before the wrong demographic . <p> If the network news divisions can not be convinced that their future depends on attracting all demographic groups , then perhaps , at least , they can be persuaded to aim for the largest single demographic with the most disposable income  --  one that may actually have an appetite for serious news . That would seem like a no-brainer . It 's regrettable , perhaps , that only money and the inclination to spend it will ultimately determine the face of television news , but , as a distinguished colleague of mine used to say : " That 's the way it is .
