<p> The truck rolled down a quiet residential street , while Adam Archuleta clung to a jury-rigged handle affixed to its rear , running for dear life to keep up . Of all the crazy things Archuleta 's trainer , Jay Schroeder , had concocted in the name of improving his fitness , this was surely the most bizarre . But Archuleta , then a wide-eyed teenager , went along willingly . <p> These were the early days of the Archuleta-Schroeder relationship . Archuleta was a junior at Chandler High School in Arizona . That he would soon dominate the Pacific-10 as a linebacker at Arizona State , then get drafted 20th overall by the St. Louis Rams , convert to a defensive back and become the highest-paid safety in NFL history when the Washington Redskins signed him in March was unimaginable at the time . <p> To Archuleta , Schroeder and his unconventional tactics provided his best  --  if not only  --  chance of playing pro football , so he turned over his mind , body and soul to the trainer . No task was refused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100-yard bursts while clenching a moving automobile for up to a half-mile at a time . <p> " From Day One , Jay has had me do some wild stuff , " said Archuleta , who signed a six-year , $30 million contract with Washington . " And from Day One , for whatever reason , I did everything he told me to , when he told me to do it , in the way he told me to do it . There was complete faith and trust in what he was saying , and I do n't think there was ever a point where I doubted anything . It was always , ' Okay , cool , whatever I have to do . Sometimes it kind of looks crazy , but let 's do it . ' " <p> Twelve years after his relationship with Schroeder began , Archuleta , 28 , is the newest cog in Redskins assistant head coach Gregg Williams 's defense . He is tough , yet unassuming off the field . He has the skills to attack the football , and with the study habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Williams 's sons is a devotee of Archuleta 's workout video , " Freak of Training , " and spoke about the safety 's prowess to his father for years . Archuleta , meantime , was tired of playing for St. Louis , a finesse , offense-oriented franchise , a close friend said . He wanted a new team that stressed defense . <p> " He kind of has a chip on his shoulder coming in here , " Williams said . " I love those guys . Those are the kinds of guys that are easy to coach because there 's an automatic match for a blend . The mentality that he 's been raised on in his offseason program , the toughness of his trainer , and the toughness of paying the price in peace so you do n't bleed as much in war , he sees that 's already a unified part of our defense , so it was really a quick sell . " <p> Finding common ground with Schroeder was more challenging for Archuleta . <p> Archuleta initially approached him at a gym near his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schroeder , 50 , found the 175-pound high school junior cocky  --  and made it clear that he was not to set foot in the gym again . <p> He wrote up a workout routine for Archuleta to follow anyway . <p> " From the day I met him he basically tore me up for a couple of hours verbally , " Archuleta said . " I got home and my mother said , ' How did it go ? ' And I said , ' He pretty much cussed me out the whole time . ' " <p> Archuleta was told to keep a detailed journal , tracking the technique he used for each weight lifting exercise , how much time it took to complete the drill , how his muscles felt after a workout , what he ate , how long he slept . Finally , when there could be no denying his dedication , he was allowed to work out with Schroeder in Mesa , Ariz . Archuleta began training with Schroeder daily . <p> " Adam has a tremendous desire to achieve . That 's what sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lot 's of people talk about it , but he actually has it . He 's an intelligent , freethinking human being who does n't know any boundaries or limits ; he does n't realize there might be limits on what he can do , and that 's pretty cool . " <p> Schroeder made Archuleta work six to seven hours a day on both upper and lower body . A routine session would include Archuleta doing a bench press , but allowing the weight to fall near his chest and then catching it before hoisting it back up . He would extend one arm and hold a heavy bar in a set position for as long as possible , then do it again . <p> Today , they still drop and catch barbells and dumbbells , with a precise series of techniques required for each motion . Archuleta does bench presses while trainers and spotters provide strong resistance , keeping the bar pressed against his chest , before immediately hitting the ground to do " rebound push-ups . " That entails thrusting his body in the air , maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springing back up for another push-up . <p> There is no stretching in Schroeder 's program ; it is built into the exercises . The entire body is trained in every session with no days devoted to particular muscle groups . <p> " The exercises look pretty eccentric , " said Dave Shapiro , the athletic director at Chandler High School , who hired Schroeder three years ago to train the school 's athletic teams . " But there 's no doubt in my mind that what Jay is doing now everybody will be doing in 10 years . " <p> Everything Schroeder devised for Archuleta in high school was for long-term gain , so he could begin peaking physically in four to five years . Their focus was on the 2001 NFL draft . <p> " Jay told me right away that he 's not trying to make me Superman in my senior year of high school , " Archuleta said . " He said , ' This is my goal , this is my vision for you , and it 's all going to really start happening when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archuleta was a walk-on at Arizona State , redshirting as a freshman , playing as a reserve as a sophomore , then starting for three years and earning Pac-10 defensive player of the year honors as a senior . He became friends with Pat Tillman , another undersized linebacker and fitness fanatic who became an NFL star , then quit to join the U.S. Army . Tillman , who became a Ranger , was killed two years ago in Afghanistan . <p> It was a few months after his senior season , during the 2001 NFL draft combine , that the mythology of " Adam Archuleta  --  Workout Warrior " was born . He arrived at the combine a lean 6 feet , 210 pounds , and bench-pressed 225 pounds 31 times , a record for a defensive back . He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.37 seconds . He 's listed today at 6 feet , 223 pounds . <p> " A lot of guys who pressure from the defensive secondary figure out a way not to get to the quarterback , " said Redskins associate head coach Al Saunders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be a deep defender , and it gives you some problems . You 've got to account for a guy like him , because he 'll make himself accountable to the players when he hits them , and he makes himself accountable to his coaches with the way he disguises his coverages . " <p> Archuleta was named to several all-rookie teams in 2001 as St. Louis lost to New England in the Super Bowl . In 2002 , he posted a 14-tackle game , and in 2003 registered five sacks , an interception , one forced fumble and again topped the 100-tackle mark . <p> The following season brought the first significant setback of his career , however . He suffered a herniated disk , but still played in every game , including two in the postseason . Team doctors recommended surgery and Archuleta began to hear the whispers that his intense training with Schroeder had caught up with him . <p> He chose to spend the offseason recovering on his own , assembling what he refers to as " my team , " a group of experts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four months after the herniated disc was discovered , Archuleta was back with the Rams for spring workouts . He played all 16 games in 2005 . <p> " When I was hurt I heard a lot of detractors who said my injury was the result of what I had been doing to my body with Jay , " Archuleta said . " But that could n't be more wrong . Sticking with my team was the best decision I ever made . " <p> Schroeder said : " Adam knows what got him to where he was , and he understood the real source of his injury and how it occurred . " <p> Archuleta has spent much of this offseason in Arizona , as Williams excused him from the opening weeks of Washington 's training program to stay with Schroeder . " We have an understanding that as long as I show up in shape and work hard and play hard , everything is fine , " Archuleta said . <p> When the Redskins complete their minicamp , Archuleta will resume training with Schroeder in Arizona . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the tools that God gave him , " Schroeder said . " His spirit , emotion , intellect , psychology  --  he uses every aspect of what makes him human to his advantage , and that 's what other teams should fear . "
