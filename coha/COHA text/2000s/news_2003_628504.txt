<p> The adoption took only a few minutes . <p> In the 309th Family District Court , attorney Richard Flowers faced Yvonne Jackson . She had a cane in her right hand , her ever-present oxygen tank behind her . <p> Did she want to adopt Samatha Harris , 20 , and her 18-year-old twin sisters , Tracy and Stacy ? <p> If Jackson could have one wish in the whole world , that would be it . She answered Flowers with such conviction , those chattering in the visitors ' gallery stopped and stared . <p> For Flowers , who had been up late the night before helping to engineer the high-profile Neil Bush-Sharon Bush divorce settlement , this pro bono case was sweet relief , two aspirin for a headache . He turned to the Harris sisters , unable to contain radiant smiles or the occasional giggle . All three were adults and responsible for themselves . <p> He asked each one , slowly : Do you want to be adopted by Yvonne Jackson ? <p> Yes , they did . Jackson raised them from diapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be separated . She fought for them . She fed them when she herself was hungry . <p> By this time , the staff hovering around family court Judge Frank Rynd was quiet and watching , too . In the Harris County Family Law Center , where families routinely are ripped apart , it was heartening to see one family cemented together . <p> Jackson , in a pink shift and blue slippers , cleared her throat to speak to Rynd . By blood , she said , she was the girls ' paternal aunt . On paper , she was their legal guardian . But sometimes , that just was n't enough . <p> She had wanted to adopt the girls for years , but she could n't afford the legal fees . When she asked for help , some lawyers shrugged and turned away . Some asked her insulting questions . Was she a drug addict ? Was she an alcoholic ? One said the required paper shuffling and court appearances for three adult adoptions would cost $ 2,400 . Then she met Flowers , who was glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be stuffing his pockets with money , " she said . " Instead he is helping me . " <p> Rynd had no way of knowing the trials the girls once endured or that Jackson , 68 , battles bone cancer , lung cancer and heart disease . But he could see the young women standing before him were polite , sensible , respectful and well loved . He congratulated Jackson on the fine job she had done . <p> The judge handed each young woman a teddy bear , shook hands and posed for pictures as total strangers applauded and a few wiped away tears . <p> When she 's feeling good , Jackson moves the wheelchair she uses occasionally to her back porch . There she can watch the squirrels and birds and talk when she feels like it . <p> " Her name was Gwendolyn , " Jackson begins . " I liked her the instant I met her . But she was young , and she had problems , and my brother was not there to share the burden . " <p> Jackson is describing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Samatha in 1982 and the twins in 1984 . All three babies were abused and neglected . Jackson prefers not to rehash the details . Let sleeping dogs lie , she says . <p> In 1985 , when the girls were starving and hurt , caseworkers from Child Protective Services in Harris County took custody , placed them in three different foster homes and started interviewing relatives for more permanent placements . <p> Jackson , then 50 , single , and working as a licensed vocational nurse at Bellaire General Hospital , wanted the whole bunch . <p> No way , the caseworker said . The girls were needy and hard to handle . Take Samatha , she said . She 'd find other homes for the twins . <p> Jackson could n't bear the thought of the sisters separated . " I would n't be able to look at myself in the mirror , " she said . " If I ca n't have all of them , I wo n't take Samatha . " <p> The caseworker thought she figured out a way to show Jackson how wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stacy were dropped in Jackson 's living room . By Sunday evening , the caseworker felt sure , Jackson would be done with the twins . <p> Instead , Jackson started to cry when the caseworker came to take them away . Then Samatha cried . Then the caseworker cried , too . <p> For once , the twins were smiling and not crying . <p> " They were still so little , they did n't understand , " Jackson said . " They were just happy and full . " <p> On the spot , the caseworker called then-family court Judge Eric Andell . He gave Jackson the girls , at least temporarily . <p> In the next two years , Andell offered Ralph and Gwendolyn Harris numerous opportunities to change their lives and win the girls back . <p> They would n't or could n't . Jackson became the children 's legal guardian in 1987 . <p> For the next five years , the girls rarely saw either parent . <p> " You look so pretty , " Gwendolyn would tell the girls if she saw them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves you , " and melt away . <p> Gwendolyn died of cervical cancer in October 1992 . She was 36 . <p> That November , when Ralph was 56 , he learned he had pancreatic cancer . He spent the next six months at Jackson 's home , with his children . <p> " He made our lives a living hell , " Jackson says . " Sometimes he 'd turn on the charm , and sometimes he was like a volcano - he 'd erupt on you . When he started ranting I was supposed to sit down and shut up . But I was n't the sit-down-and-shut-up type . " <p> When a doctor finally said he was near death and needed hospice care , Jackson was relieved . She already had her hands full with the girls . <p> The twins were developmentally delayed and needed special education classes . Samatha did well in school , but sometimes she was anxious and distracted . <p> In 1990 , when the twins were 6 and Samatha , 8 , Jackson started having health problems . She wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tests . But at the time , she did n't know anyone willing and able to keep the girls . <p> In desperation , Jackson finally trusted a local adoption agency with foster care services . She was in the hospital only two days , however , when Samatha called . <p> Their foster father put them in closets when he wanted to discipline them , Samatha said , and he threatened them with dog attacks . <p> " Samatha would n't lie , " Jackson says firmly . " I had my doctor release me . He did n't want to , but I said I was gone either way . " <p> For the next five years , Jackson shoved her health worries aside . If she felt bad , she popped a Tylenol . In 1995 , long after over-the-counter pills stopped helping , she returned to her doctor . She already knew something was terribly wrong . <p> Bone cancer , the doctor said . <p> At night she lay awake , wondering if she was going to die before the girls were self-sufficient . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love them like she did ? <p> She also worried about money . She retired after the girls came to live with her because they needed full-time care . Until 1994 , they lived off her savings . <p> " We were n't on welfare , we were n't on food stamps , we were n't getting any assistance , " Jackson says . " I think that was pretty good . For nine years , I paid for rent , utilities , and bought all those toys and ribbons and clothes that had to match . " <p> Jackson pauses , then her eyes start to crinkle and she bends over laughing . " I think they could have used my budgeting skills at Enron , " she says . " Lord have mercy , I would have given those executives drug tests and told them to put their hands in the air . " <p> Unfortunately , she did n't have time for that diversion . She hated that she could n't afford the extras all children want - skates , trips to the circus , fast-food hamburgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money for the things they needed . <p> The children were entitled to Social Security benefits , so Jackson applied for them . Also , she received help from Chronicle readers . By chance a reporter had interviewed her for a story on relative caregivers . Her comments were so powerful , dozens of readers called the paper and offered help . <p> The story ran in October 1995 . By August 1996 , Jackson had enough money to participate in a program that helped low-income citizens buy homes . <p> At the time , she and the girls were living in a rented house so cramped Samatha slept in the dining area . The house Jackson found in north Houston had a bedroom for Samatha , a bedroom for the twins , a bedroom for her , and a large yard . <p> When Jackson was more nimble - not hobbled by oxygen tanks and canes and wheelchairs - she was an avid gardener . <p> In 2001 , Samatha graduated from Waltrip High School . In 2002 , the twins graduated from Waltrip , too . All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money for tuition . Samatha wants to be a teacher ; Stacy , a seamstress ; Tracy , a teller in a bank . <p> Until then , they are at home , waiting for a local job training program to start and taking care of Jackson . She takes care of them , and they take care of her . <p> That 's the way families work , Samatha says . <p> When she and her sisters have jobs , Tracy says , they 'll buy their mom a car , which she really needs , and a puppy , just for fun . <p> Hearing about the puppy , Jackson says , " The girls make me laugh all the time . " <p> Then , afraid her girls are underestimated and undervalued , she turns fierce . <p> " Do you know how proud I am of them ? Do you know how many boys and girls get lost by the wayside ? These young ladies do n't take drugs , they do n't drink , they still have their innocence , they 're dutiful in church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . In this day and time , that is a triumph . <p> " I 'm not just a blessing to them , " Jackson says . " They are a blessing to me . " <p> It 's hard to predict how Mother 's Day celebrations will unfold at the Jackson home , but there are a few certainties . <p> Samatha , Tracy and Stacy will shower their mother with homemade gifts . Samatha will make Jackson 's favorite dinner , catfish . <p> If Jackson is not feeling well enough to go to church , throughout the day there will be many prayers and references to the Lord , anyway . She says she leans on him . She depends on him . <p> In the afternoon , Laura Norman will drop by with a cake and a potted plant . She and Jackson have been best friends since 1992 , when they met at church . <p> Norman , 89 , helps the girls when Jackson goes to the hospital . She helps with the grocery shopping , and she helps with the worrying . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently told Jackson she needed surgery but was too weak to handle the anesthesia . <p> Jackson stumbles over the word , " anesthesia . " <p> " That 's not a word you can say with a bunch of missing teeth , " she says . <p> Mostly , however , Norman and Jackson are optimists . They understand that they have problems , but there are plenty of people worse off . They understand that life is sometimes hard . It 's how they jump the hurdles that counts , they say . <p> " She 's sick off and on , " Norman says of Jackson , " but mostly she bounces back . " <p> Jackson and Norman agree the girls have changed since the adoption . <p> " Now they 're more boisterous , more bossy , " Jackson says . " They tell me what to do . They used to say , ' Mama , can I do such-and-such for you ? ' " <p> Jackson makes her booming voice timid in imitation of the girls of the past . Then she makes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The girls tell me , ' It 's time for you to eat . ' Or , ' It 's time for me to brush your hair . ' Or I 'll be watching something on TV and they 'll say , ' Turn that off . That makes me nervous and you do n't need to be looking at it , either . ' " <p> Jackson loves the change . Before the adoption , she says , the twins would occasionally wonder if she really wanted to adopt them . That was the real reason she had to make it happen , she says . She was afraid she 'd take a turn for the worse and leave them wondering . <p> <p> DID YOU KNOW ? <p> About 75 million women in the United States are mothers . <p> Fewer U.S. women are having children <p> Percentage of women 40 to 44 years old who are mothers <p> 1980 90% <p> 2002 81% <p> They are having fewer children <p> Percentage of women who end their childbearing years with four or more children <p> 1976 36% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their first <p> Median age of women when they give birth for the first time <p> 1970 21 years <p> 2002 25 years <p> <p> FACTS ABOUT MOM <p> Mother 's Day - the second Sunday in May - became an official observance in 1914 when Congress passed legislation . <p> It is estimated that there are 75 million mothers of all ages in the U.S. Ten million of them are single mothers living with children 18 or younger . <p> Each year , 4 million women have babies .
