SAMUEL JOHNSON IS INDIGNANT STORIES By Lydia Davis McSweeney 's Books We know only four boring people . The rest of our friends we find very interesting . However , most of the friends we find interesting find us boring : the most interesting find us the most boring . The few who are somewhere in the middle , with whom there is reciprocal interest , we distrust : at any moment , we feel , they may become too interesting for us , or we too interesting for them . She hated a mown lawn . Maybe that was because mow was the reverse of wom , the beginning of the name of what she wasa woman . A mown lawn had a sad sound to it , like a long moan . From her , a mown lawn made a long moan . Lawn had some of the letters of man , though the reverse of man would be Nam , a bad war . A raw war . Lawn also contained the letters of law . In fact , lawn was a contraction of lawman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Law and order could be seen as starting from lawn order , valued by so many Americans . More lawn could be made using a lawn mower . A lawn mower did make more lawn . More lawn was a contraction of more lawmen . Did more lawn in America make more lawmen in America ? Did more lawn make more Nam ? More mown lawn made more long moan , from her . Or a lawn mourn . So often , she said , Americans wanted more mown lawn . All of America might be one long mown lawn . A lawn not mown grows long , she said : better a long lawn . Better a long lawn and a mole . Let the lawman have the mown lawn , she said . Or the moron , the lawn moron . They have moved to the country . The country is nice enough : there are quail sitting in the bushes and frogs peeping in the swamps . But they are uneasy . They quarrel more often . They cry , or she cries and he bows his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wakes in a panic at night , hearing him sniffle . She wakes in a panic again , hearing a car go up the driveway . In the morning there is sunlight on their faces but mice are chattering in the walls . He hates the mice . The pump breaks . They replace the pump . They poison the mice . Their neighbor 's dog barks . It barks and barks . She could poison the dog . " We 're city people , " he says , " and there are n't any nice cities to live in . " In her fantasies about other men , as she grew older , about men other than her husband , she no longer dreamed of sexual intimacy , as she once had , perhaps for revenge , when she was angry , perhaps out of loneliness , when he was angry , but only of an affection and a profound sort of understanding , a holding of hands and a gazing into eyes , often in a public place like a caf . She did not know if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did truly respect him , or out of plain weariness , at the end of the day , or out of a sense of what activity she could expect from herself , even in a fantasy , now that she was a certain age . And when she was particularly tired , she could n't even manage the affection and the profound understanding , but only the mildest sort of companionship , such as being in the same room alone together , sitting in chairs . And it happened that as she grew older still , and more tired , and then still older , and still more tired , another change occurred and she found that even the mildest sort of companionship , alone together , was now too vigorous to sustain , and her fantasies were limited to a calm sort of friendliness among other friends , the sort she really could have had with any man , with a clear conscience , and did in fact have with many , who were friends of her husband 's too , or not , a friendliness that gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her waking life were not enough , or had not been enough by the end of the day . And so these fantasies came to be indistinguishable from the reality of her waking life , and should not have been any sort of betrayal at all . Yet because they were fantasies she had alone , at night , they continued to feel like some sort of betrayal , and perhaps , because approached in this spirit of betrayal , as perhaps they had to be , to be any comfort and strength , continued to be , in fact , a sort of betrayal . THE WHITE TRIBE We live near a tribe of bloodless white people . Day and night they come to steal things from us . We have put up tall wire fences but they spring over them like gazelles and grin fiendishly up at us where we stand looking out of our windows . They rub the tops of their heads until their thin flaxen hair stands up in tufts , and they strut back and forth over our gravel terrace . While we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our garden and are furtively taking our roses , stuffing them into bags which hang from their naked shoulders . They are pitifully thin , and as we watch them we become ashamed of our fence . Yet when they go , slipping away like white shadows in the gloom , we grow angry at the devastation they have left among our Heidelbergs and Lady Belpers , and resolve to take more extreme measures against them . It is not always the roses they come for , but sometimesthough the countryside for miles is covered with boulders and shards of stonethey carry away the very rocks from our woods , and walking out in the morning we find the ground pitted with hollows where pale bugs squirm blindly down into the earth .
