When designer Carmen Marc Valvo showed his fall 2005 collection during New York Fashion Week last month , there were no starlets in the front row prowling for Oscar gowns . Nor did his designs grab headlines , top must-have lists or spark debate . And yet over the 16 years Valvo has designed his namesake label , he has quietly garnered one thing his colleagues would covet : a buzz-worthy bottom line . <P> " I like to give women something that 's beautiful and wearable , " says Valvo , 51 . " And because I do that , I do n't get as much attention . Being flavor of the month is not going to keep me in business . " <P> Depending on whom you ask , however , Valvo may have been the flavor of the past decadeand counting . His less expensive Collection line is the top eveningwear seller at Neiman Marcus , for instance , while his higher-end shutter-pleat dress has pulled in more than $4 million in sales . Making time for his runway show : Neiman Marcus Group CEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodman CEO Jim Gold . <P> The business of fashion is n't always a pretty thing . Designers are increasingly bending to the whims of corporate backers , as big names like Helmut Lang have lost control of their houses , while designers like Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney have been given ultimatums to boost profitability . Valvo , in contrast , owns his own $80 million company  --  an industry rarity  --  and has no intention of ceding control . <P> Valvo 's attitude toward glamour is democratic . His dresses have Vera Wang grace , Narciso Rodriguez sexiness and the intricate detailing and embellishment of Valentino couture . His careful construction makes such high styles suitable for a variety of body types and sizes . The shutter-pleat dress , for example , consists of bias-cut strips of fabric stitched together to create a de facto corset . " They 're miracle dresses , " Valvo says . " Put the body in there and  --  shoop ! The bias expands and controls . Everyone ends up with this amazing hourglass figure . " <P> " Women are just very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan Kaner , fashion director at Neiman Marcus . " There are a lot of little slip dresses out there , but there are n't many women , really , who can wear them . " <P> Even in Valvo 's Collection line , which makes up 75% of his profit , underpinnings are key . One $390 beaded-lace skirt features a pleated-tulle petticoat . When celebrities do wear Valvo  --  Catherine Zeta-Jones ; Beyonce , to meet Nelson Mandela in South Africa  --  they trade on his style , not his name . " There 's an incredible simplicity to the lines but an impact and glamour you do n't find a lot of places , " says stylist Nick Steele , who has dressed Claire Danes and Radha Mitchell in Valvo 's looks . Valvo , who spends four months of each year traveling to meet current and future clients , is in no danger of losing touch . " It 's not like I 'm in some ivory tower , " he says . " There 's just too much of that nonsense . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
