The Ascent // I 'm LeBron , baby . //  --  Barack Obama // For those who know Barack Obama well , this might sound close to impossible , but the swagger in his step appeared even cockier than usual on the afternoon of July 27 , 2004. // As summertime bathed downtown Boston in warm sunshine , Obama led a gaggle of reporters , aides and a couple of friends  --  a group occasionally two dozen deep  --  around a maze of chain-link security fences guarding the large-scale FleetCenter indoor arena . A former high school basketball player who , at forty-two , still relished a pickup game , the rail-thin Obama was carrying his upper body as if he were heading to the free throw line for the game-winning shot , a shot he believed was destined to sink . His shoulders were pitched backward . His head was held erect . His blue-suited torso swayed in a side-by-side motion with every pace forward . His enormous confidence appeared at an all-time peak . And for good reason : hours later , the Illinois state lawmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national stage to deliver his now famous 2004 keynote address to the Democratic National Convention . // Indeed , Obama 's time in the bright sunshine had arrived . And though this moment had come upon him rather quickly , un-expectedly and somewhat weirdly , with only weeks of notice , his opportunity to prove to the world that he could play in this most elite league was at hand . Finally . // Having covered Obama for the Chicago Tribune since the early days of his U.S. Senate candidacy more than nine months before , I had already established a rapport with the state senator , and I was mostly trying to stay out of the way and watch the day unfold , watch the story of Barack Obama unfurl . Still , as a skeptical newspaper reporter , I was not completely convinced that , by day 's end , all would come out well . I was still trying to gauge if this strut was something of an act , whether his winning free throw would clang on the rim and bounce away or whether he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national name for himself . // After Obama and I slipped through a security checkpoint and he momentarily broke free from the entourage , I sidled up to him and told him that he seemed to be impressing many people of influence in this rarefied atmosphere . // Obama , his gaze fixed directly ahead , never broke his stride . // " I 'm LeBron , baby , " he replied , referring to LeBron James , the phenomenally talented teenager who at the time was shooting the lights out in the National Basketball Association . " I can play on this level . I got some game . " // I was n't so sure . I fell back amid the marching gaggle of the Obama entourage and chatted with one of his closest friends , Marty Nesbitt , who had flown in from Chicago to accompany Obama during the convention week . I asked Nesbitt how he thought his friend would perform that night , given all the media attention and political pressure . " He sat down with Ted Koppel earlier this week and he hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nesbitt asked . " Barack reminds me of a player on my high school basketball team back in Ohio . He could elevate his game to almost any situation . And when we needed a shot , he always hit it . Always . " // That evening , Obama introduced himself to America . He delivered a keynote address of historic proportions , so inspiring that even some conservative commentators would concede they were moved by it . His rich baritone voice resolute and clear , he hearkened back to his beloved mother 's philosophy of a common humanity , a philosophy that had been ingrained in him throughout his childhood . He declared that America is a land of good-hearted people , a nation of citizens who have more unifying traits than dividing traits , a country of individuals bound by the common purpose of freedom and opportunity for all . " There 's not a liberal America and a conservative America  --  there 's the United States of America . There 's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are one people . . . . " // Across the arena , many Democrats from various states , various walks of life , various races , had tears in their eyes . And as the woman seated next to me in an upper level of the FleetCenter joyously shrieked  --  " Oh my god ! Oh my god ! This is history ! This is history ! "  --  I looked around at the energized and emotional crowd and heard myself speak aloud to no one in particular . // " Yes , indeed . Tonight , Barack , you are LeBron , baby . " // Throughout 2004 , the political and cultural mood in Obama 's home state of Illinois  --  and much of the country  --  was sharply polarized . A bevy of Democratic presidential aspirants had vied to challenge President George W. Bush , who had led the country into war in Afghanistan , and then Iraq , in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington . Chagrined from being in the minority in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate who could defeat Bush in the November election . Among those Democrats , Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts had won the party 's nomination , but despairing Democrats were having difficulty warming up to him . They hungered for something more than Kerry could offer  --  a political savior , an inspirational figure who could lead them out of one of the darkest periods in their party 's history . Kerry surely seemed electable , but his reserved nature and plodding public style made him far from a savior who could stir the souls of the masses . // At this point the nation was evenly divided on the Iraq war , but the Democrats were not . In the eyes of many moderate Democrats who had initially supported the war , the nationalistic fever that had washed over America in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist strike was beginning to wear off . For most left-leaning party members , the war had been nothing short of a colossal mistake from the . . . //               @ @ @ @ @ @
