It had taken them a week of work to get this far , digging out the site only at night , trying to stay safe from watching eyes . The two moved rubble and dug in silence , working mostly by feel . Each of them had more cuts and scrapes on their hands than they could count , and their fingers were numb from the effort and the cold of the air and the bite of the frozen snow . The elder of the two , Paolo , was only twenty-one . His brother , Nicky , was nineteen . They had arrived in Gotham during the summer , immigrating illegally with their parents , and for a while it had looked good for all of them . Then the earthquake came , and the tenement they were living in , the room they shared with two other families , was buried under twenty tons of concrete and iron from the building next door . The bodies were never recovered . When No Man 's Land came , they stayed more out of fear than anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads , in the tunnels . Soldiers with guns , and both Paolo and Nicky had bad memories of soldiers with guns from their childhood in Colombia . As far as they were concerned , the soldiers meant one of two things : either they 'd be shot , or they 'd be deported . And being deported , that amounted to being shot . So they stayed . It had to be past midnight when Nicky heard his brother speak for the first time in hours , the hoarse whisper of excitement . " I found it , " Paolo hissed in Spanish . " I found a way in , look . " Nicky moved , checking where his brother pointed . It was a clear night , with half a moon , and in the light and past the shadows he could see where Paolo was indicating , a small opening , just big enough to wriggle through . And inside , the prize , a whole Jiffy Junior convenience store , a mother lode of treasure . Canned goods , batteries , flashlights , aspirin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You remember what we do , " Paolo whispered . " You go in , you grab what you can , we cover it up again , then take it to Penguin . He 'll take care of us . But we do n't tell him where we found it , we keep this our secret . " " I remember , " Nicky snapped . " Of course I remember . " " Keep your voice down . " Nicky frowned , then took the flashlight his brother handed him . It was their prized possession , and they had only turned it on once since they 'd found it , just to make certain the batteries worked . Now Nicky held it tightly in one hand as he got on his knees , and crawled through the tiny opening . The stink inside was awful , and almost immediately he wanted to throw up . He told himself it was spoiled milk and meat , and not a body . He told himself it did n't matter if it was a body , because the dead had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and managed to work his way out of the hole , dropping down inside the wreckage of the store . His feet splashed in something when he landed , he did n't know what . It was entirely black inside but for the broken circle of moonlight leaking in from above . Nicky turned on the flashlight , then turned it off again . Jiffy Junior stores were open twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week . They never closed . That was their motto , he knew that . There had been customers inside when the earthquake hit . From above , he heard his brother 's voice . " Nicky ? Are you all right ? " Nicky tried to answer , caught another whiff of the air , and now there was no way to pretend it was anything but death . He felt his stomach buckle , swallowed hard , and managed the words . " There are bodies , " he told his brother . " Ignore them , " Paolo hissed . " Hurry , Nicky . We do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , I 'm looking . " Paolo shut up . Nicky switched on the flashlight again , panning the beam carefully past the corpses , toward the fallen racks . He went for the batteries first , then for the cigarette lighters on the counter . He stuffed his pockets full of all the small things he could find , tiny tins of Imodium and aspirin , bandages , matches , whatever would fit , before switching to the backpack . He was smart about it , he thought , taking another backpack , rolling it up tightly and putting it in the first . Everyone needed a backpack in the No Man 's Land . Everyone had to carry all their possessions with them . Then he went to the racks , quickly examining the cans , taking only those that were still sealed . Ravioli , soup , beans , tuna , all into the backpack . Two cans of Soder Cola , and another two cans of Brew Beer . He put more and more into the backpack until he was afraid the seams would split , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as closed as he could make it , then moving back to the hole . " I 'm coming up , " he whispered , pushing the backpack into the opening with a shove . Then he turned back , letting the flashlight track one last time through the store . He switched it off , but the image stayed , the crushed bodies still lit in his mind . He whispered a quick prayer , then climbed back into the hole . It was n't Paolo waiting for him when he came out . It was someone else , a big man , bald , and behind him were three others , one of them already going through the backpack , the other two holding Paolo by the arms . In the moonlight , Nicky could see where his brother was bleeding at the mouth , and it made his stomach shrink . Then the big man was pulling him to his feet , and showing him the pointed end of a machete . " This is Demonz territory , " the man said . " You 've just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what I should do . " Nicky fumbled for the words in English and managed , " It 's not stealing . " The big man laughed and shoved him back with his free hand . " Empty your pockets , let 's see what you brought us . " Nicky glanced at his brother , saw Paolo 's jaw clenched tight , more rage than fear in his eyes . It crept into Nicky , as well . " No . It 's ours . " The man looked at Nicky , surprised at the defiance , then sighed , cutting at the air with the blade . " You just broke Demonz law , kid . " Nicky realized that he was going to die , and started another prayer , hoping to finish it before the machete came back down . He watched the blade go up , the moonlight catching its edge , watched it start to fall . Then the blade was gone and the man was holding his hand where it was now bleeding , and there had been a noise , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his head toward it , and saw the shape , and his heart stopped for a second , because he knew what it was . He had never seen it before , no one he knew had , and some people had even told him it was a lie , made up by the police , to scare the criminals . But Nicky had always known it was true , and he knew what it was . So did the big man . The shape moved , passing Nicky faster than a shadow hit by light , and there was another sound , and the big man made a noise of pain , and fell backward . The shape spoke . " Leave them alone . " And Nicky thought there was something wrong , then , because he 'd never imagined the voice would sound like that . The big man tried to get up , and the shape moved again , and Nicky heard the snap of another kick . The man made more noise , and then the shape had grabbed him by the shirt , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others stood stunned . Even Paolo , Nicky thought , looked stunned . But Paolo had never believed . The shape kept moving , another rustle of shadow , and the gang member who had taken the backpack dropped it , spilling the contents all on the ground . The other Street Demonz , who had been holding Paolo , moved forward , trying to attack . But you can not attack a shadow , Nicky thought , and as if to prove him right , their blows landed in empty air . There was another rustle , and the shape was behind them , had one of the men by the arm , had hit him twice in the face , then was pitching him sharply away . Another of the gang members was passing Nicky , as if trying to flee , and the shape turned , and Nicky got a good look then , just for an instant , as the shape reached out as if its arm were impossibly long . The man pitched forward into the street with a cry , then stumbled back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Demonz had already fled . " Batman , " Paolo said . Nicky tried to find his voice , to say , no , no , not Batman , at least , not like we were told , but the shape was already crouching at the backpack , replacing the spilled cans , then offering the bag to Nicky . When the arms moved , the cape billowed back , and Nicky saw the shape in the shadow , the yellow outline of the bat on the black chest . A woman 's chest . Nicky took the bag , staring . " Are you all right ? " He tried to speak , failed utterly , and simply nodded . " TriCorner is held by the GCPD . You 'll be safer there , " the woman said , and then she raised an arm and there was a sound , and it was as if the Batwoman were flying away . Gone . Just like that . After a time , Nicky looked back to his brother , saw Paolo was still staring up at the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , and Nicky saw the understanding there , the awe . Without another word , the boys began heading south , toward TriCorner . It began to snow .
