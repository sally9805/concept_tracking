" Big Edie " Beale 's grandson remembers the golden times as well as the gothic ones at the East Hampton house his family called home . OCEAN CASTLE . Pudding Hill . Onadune . Houses with names like these fill books about the sweet life in the Hamptons , where specimen trees are pruned into balletic poses and the privet hedges grow almost tall enough to play dance partner . One house that has become synonymous with a decidedly unrulier take on Hamptons life goes by the name of Grey Gardens . Built in 1905 , Grey Gardens is a fourteen-room Shingle-style cottage just off Georgica Beach ; in the 1910s , when the four-acre property was owned by plantswoman Anna Gilman Hill , the gardens , laid out within Spanish cement walls , were a poetic sort of gray . The house changed hands in 1923 and eventually became famous  --  perhaps notorious is a better word  --  as the ramshackle home of " Big Edie " Beale and her daughter , " Little Edie , " freethinking aunt and first cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cult film , Grey Gardens . Photograph : The author 's grandmother Big Edie Beale , with his aunt Little Edie ( left ) , and uncle , Phelan Jr. , at the Southampton Fair in 1924 . To moviegoers and the residents of East Hampton in the 1970s , the house looked more like a prison than a postcard . To the Beales , it was a much-loved refuge and their sole economic asset . In any case , the only print Grey Gardens seemed fit for was the tabloid press , which delighted in spilling a mother and daughter 's riveting and somehow utterly American riches-to-rags story . Over the next thirty-five years , there would be follow-up films , Web sites , fashion collections , a Broadway musical and , finally , books  --  even a companion to the documentary , due this spring from Albert Maysles 's two daughters . On the occasion of the new HBO film ( see page 84 ) , which debuted in April , Town &; Country shares an excerpt from the only volume the Beale family itself has published . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , a California real-estate investor and the eldest grandson of Big Edie , remembers the place , the people and the turn of events precipitating a story that has taken on the status of an American legend . Shortly after my aunt Edie 's death in 2002 at the age of eighty-four , I found myself standing with my wife , Eva , in the white-pebbled driveway of our family home in Amagansett , New York , not but four miles from Grey Gardens . Peering into the tops of an assemblage of several four-foot-high , recently arrived UPS shipping boxes , we began sorting out , inspecting and cataloguing an extensive Bouvier and Beale **25;2934;TOOLONG collection that was started by my grandmother " Big Edie " Beale and conserved and saved for us by my aunt " Little Edie . " Part of what we discovered during the subsequent weeks and months represents a stunning chronicle of the rise , fall and rise again of a persevering New York-based family , as symbolized by Little Edie herself .

One side of our family , the Bouviers , had arrived on American shores several generations previous , penniless refugees from Napolon 's debacle at Waterloo . Raising itself up purely on guts and gumption , my family became a lead player on Wall Street during the economic boom of the early 20th century . Its incredible affluence would begin a slow decline that fateful day in October of 1929 when the U.S. economy , too tied to Wall Street , began its long but steady downfall , taking my family along with it . The economic prowess that the Bouviers and the Beales had worked so hard to achieve was to become a dim memory . Real estate , valuable stock holdings , family-founded legal and securities-trading companies  --  all fell by the wayside as the hard years between the crash and the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the love that the Beales cultivated during the good times remained . Photograph : A twenty-three-year-old Little Edie on the runway in East Hampton , 1940 . My aunt Edie , the only girl in her family , was born in 1917 and raised by her mother , Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale , whom my two brothers and I playfully referred to as the Original Bohemian . My grandmother , more politely referred to as Granny Beale , was a total free spirit  --  an artiste of the first degree . Beautiful , talented and professionally trained in classical opera by the best voice teachers that money could buy , she could , in the twenties and thirties , hold her own among the New York-area artistic elite . Her unlimited budget and her parties , mostly held sans husband , Phelan Beale  --  a hardworking , hard-drinking and successful Wall Street attorney  --  were legendary among the Andy Warhols of the day for their music , their improvisational atmosphere and particularly for their very , very late hours .

Some have said that my grandmother helped found , or at least perpetuate , the early reputation of East Hampton , at the turn of the century and through the twenties , as the exciting new bohemian artists ' colony and retreat . Close enough to New York to find plenty of wealthy patrons and possessing the intense beauty of isolated nature by the sea , East Hampton was becoming the " It " place to be . Even so , when my father , Bouvier " Buddy " Beale , spent summers with Little Edie and their brother Phelan at Grey Gardens as a child in the twenties and thirties , there were more cows than tourists or summer renters in the whole of the Hamptons . The family simply called the place " the country . " Photograph : Big Edie in a beret , 1938 . Aunt Edie wrote extensively , in the only remaining copy of any of her diaries , of summers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Manhattan , where she attended the top theater productions and first-release motion pictures of the day and took tea at the Plaza hotel with her mother and the movers and shakers on the city 's art scene . By the time Aunt Edie went away to boarding school in Connecticut , she was far wiser than most art-school graduates in the method and madness of the cultural scene in New York . Photograph : At the Ladies ' Village Improvement Society Fair in East Hampton , 1962 . During the thirties , in and around the Maidstone Club , in East Hampton , Edie was the local fashion model of choice for all the fundraisers and women 's clubs and other civic and social organizations . Although she was an amateur , her style , positive deportment and absolute radiant beauty won the day every time . Although Bouvier-Beale family money had not yet run out in the thirties , most sources of income were reduced or cut off ( belt tightening was the quaint term used in those days ) . Photograph : Before the fall : The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edie produced new works of art almost constantly , whether in the way she dressed , in her manner of speech or through spontaneous singing and dancing performances . One of her most amazing and endearing feats was her ability to take two or more seemingly contradictory elements and somehow bring them together in a way that was fresh , innovative and inspiring . Grey Gardens , the Maysles brothers ' 1975 documentary , demonstrates Edie 's now well-known proclivity for creating offbeat but sometimes knockout fashion originals by inverting women 's clothing items , wearing them on the " wrong " parts of the anatomy or mixing unlikely pieces . Two things contributed to her success : Edie 's still-perfect figure , even in her fifties , and the stark budgetary realities . Limited in funds , she simply used whatever was on hand .

I did n't know it then , but this was to be my last time setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edie had moved out ( soon to return , however ) , and my grandmother could still get about fairly well . Even after the release of the Maysleses ' film , along with negative local publicity about the dreadful living conditions at the house , I am able to recall what I witnessed that summer during my college years : Grey Gardens was a lovely property , both inside and out , simply needing a major dusting and mowing . I can remember all the furniture , household items , etc. , to have been in perfect order and placement , with no unsightly garbage piled up anywhere , no fleas , no broken windows and just a few cats lurking about . In a different day and age , my grandmother and aunt would have been given an award from the Humane Society for their treatment of animals . My aunt and grandmother were totally normal people , even exemplary , in the unselfish , loving way they treated people and all God 's creatures . They did n't know how to say no to anything or anybody and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thought they might gain some advantage thereby .

By the time the East Hampton Health Department tried to evict the two Edies , in 1972 , my other relatives had been conducting a ten-year battle of wills to get my grandmother , with her increasing health problems and with blindness approaching , out of a too-big , too-expensive , drafty and unwinterized home and into a small , charming cottage to call her own in Florida . The sale of Grey Gardens , a valuable property because of its location , would have brought more than enough to allow my grandmother to retire comfortably , with Little Edie at her side , the dutiful and loving daughter she had always been . Despite my family 's almost continual urging , the Edies steadfastly refused to leave what they thought of as their " palace . " Photograph : Playing the siren at nineteen , 1936 . My father was a struggling young attorney with college bills to pay and a life to live more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother and sister by paying the property taxes when he could . My uncle , having moved away to the Midwest years earlier , lived very modestly himself and yet continued to correspond with and financially support his family as best he could . Fortunately , Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was eventually able to step in to help her aunt and cousin , of whom she was very fond . She contributed just enough that Grey Gardens complied with local health regulations and was at least safe and comfortable , though very shabby . Events moved swiftly thereafter , with the death of Granny Beale in 1977 , the sale of Grey Gardens in 1979 and Little Edie 's move to New York City and later on to Florida , where she died in 2002 . Photograph : Mother and daughter on the Georgica Beach dunes , 1951 . At the end of her life , my aunt was content , in relatively good health and living alone in a modest Miami Beach apartment . I would visit her at least once a year and take her out to lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her request . She swam every day in the sea literally until the day she died . One of her last wishes , which we carried out , was that following her death , her ashes would be scattered off the coast of Long Island . But what would become of Grey Gardens itself ? Here is where it becomes possible to believe in miracles . The new owners turned out to be the well-known journalists Ben Bradlee and Sally Quinn . After meeting my aunt Edie , and cognizant of the amazing history of the place , they were enthralled by the whole look and feel of what remained . Far from wanting to tear the old place down , the couple chose the more painful and expensive route , spending whatever it took to restore Grey Gardens to its glory days . Recently , my wife and I were invited over for a tour by a very gracious Ben and Sally , almost exactly forty years after my last visit , in 1966 . I was overcome by both awe and nostalgia in seeing my family home restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had yielded a trove of old furniture and Beale family artifacts . The couple had repaired the furniture , dusted off the old books and reframed and displayed a few photos that were overlooked by Edie ( who usually saved everything ) . The result today is a home dedicated as a beautiful time capsule to my family 's glory days . Outside , a complete restoration has been done on the voluptuous " grey " seaside gardens , now as stunning as they once must have been . Even the tombstone of Spot , the beloved Beale family dog , has been cleaned up and remounted . From Edith Bouvier Beale of Grey Gardens , by Eva Marie Beale , 2008 Verlhac Editions .
