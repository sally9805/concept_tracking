SPY WHO LOVED <P> Their cover is blown : JENNIFER GARNER is dating MICHAEL VARTAN , who plays her CIA handler on the TV show Alias . Garner was married to Scott Foley , who starred in Felicity , until the two split up in April . But do n't even think it : Garner and Vartan have been dating only a few weeks . It 's a case of life imitating prime-time drama , since Garner 's character is in love with Vartan 's . Unless it 's all a ruse to cover up a secret romance with her Daredevil co-star Ben Affleck  --  well , probably not . But that would have been cool . <P> PRINCE ARMING <P> They do n't have SATs in Britain ; they have A-levels . PRINCE HARRY just got his scores : a B in art and a D in geography . Which is n't so good on either side of the Atlantic , so Harry will go to a military academy on his way to a career in the army . His brother William , by comparison , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a C in biology . He goes to St. Andrews , on his way to a career as ruler of England . See where a little studying will get you ? <P> TIME MMMMARCHES ON <P> Like a comet in the night sky , they flared oh-so-brightly and disappeared  --  and then came back a few years later . In 1997 the pop group HANSON  --  brothers ZAC ( the little one ) , TAYLOR ( the cute one ) and ISAAC ( the other one )  --  sold more than 8 million copies of their debut album , Middle of Nowhere ( maybe you remember their No. 1 single , MMMBop ) , but the band 's second effort flopped , and Hanson went away for a long stay in pop purgatory . Now they 're back playing club dates in support of a folksy new album called Underneath Acoustic . Little Zac is 17 and stubbly , and Taylor is ( sigh ) married with a child . Can you match names to faces , then and now ? That 's Taylor , Zac and Isaac in 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top to bottom .
