Lights up on SHADY . SHADY moves about the space as if he is stalking through his own mind . He searches through his eyes . A slide projector casts scenes of New York City  --  past and present  --  upon a graffiti marked wall or backdrop : a bird's-eye-view of the Statue of Liberty , Theatre Row ( NYC ) , The Empire State Building across some roof tops , Central Park  --  summer and winter  --  Harlem : the Apollo Theater marquee , Magic Johnson 's movie palace on Malcolm X Boulevard , The Harlem Disney Store , Starbucks at Lenox and 125th , a photo of Surpreme Court Judge Clarence Thomas , and the grimy corners and doorways where crackheads mingle with passing upright black citizens and tourists of the world . The projections dim out . Lights up on SHADY . SHADY ( steps forward ) Yeah yeah so nice , they had to name it twice . The ghetto fabulous oh rooney skeezer wheezer . An O.G . like me knows all that shit . Heavy duty . Heavy duty . Harlem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' member the time back in the day when whitey tipped lightly ' round Harlem . That 's if he or she was wild , weird or wrong enough to step to this Big Black Babylon . Back in the day Harlem ran on soul and revolutionary fervor . Now it 's all about the dollah . Tourists and tour buses . And the Euro/Asian/3rd World Diaspora everyman is buyin ' the buildin 's and the heritage , ' cept for the poor workin ' class American blacks who have dwelt in Harlem for the past hundred years . Yeah if I did n't know better I 'd forget this was a ghetto , man . Ai n't that right , Crafty ? Lights up on Harlem 's Starbucks . CRAFTY sits at a table . A traditional dark roast is in front of him . Across from CRAFTY is a latte . SHADY walks over and picks his latte up . p. 3 SHADY Ai n't that right , Crafty ?

And this is Harlem , you know , where the streets are made of gold . CRAFTY Outside of sarcasim , and daydream , you have nothing to offer , homeboy . Just let me scheme up on some success . CRAFTY sips at his coffee . A YOUNG BLACKWOMAN comes over to the table , carrying a cup of tea . SISSY Do you mind if I share your table ? SHADY and CRAFTY look dumbfounded . THEY look at each other to see the other 's reaction . SISSY I guess you do n't mind , so I 'll just sit down . SHE pulls out a chair and sits at the table .
