COVER STORY One journalist 's journey of discovery <p> Forget about the Soccer Mom , object of obsessive interest to political strategists in the last two presidential elections . Two election cycles is as much concentrated attention as a voter bloc can expect to get in these fast-changing times . The candidates of 2004 have fixed their sights on a new quarry : the NASCAR Dad . So , at any rate , we are told by Democratic pollster Celinda Lake , who coined the term . A NASCAR Dad is a rural or small-town voter , most likely white and living in the South . Once upon a time he was a reliable Democrat , but he has been voting steadily Republican in recent elections for " cultural " reasons  --  reasons having to do with guns , religion , patriotism , and lifestyle . What , exactly , is his connection with NASCAR  --  the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing ? In the hope of finding out , I recently attended a major NASCAR event at the Talladega track in Alabama . Before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sport NASCAR represents . <p> The term " stock car " refers to a street automobile from a dealer 's stock , the kind you and I drive , as opposed to the custom-built pod-and-strut mutants you see in Formula One racing . When ordinary citizens began to purchase automobiles in large numbers in the 1930s and 1940s , some of them were taken with the urge to race against other drivers on unpaved local dirt tracks . Spectators assembled to watch . Drivers tinkered with their engines to give them more speed . This was happening all over the country by the late 1940s , when NASCAR was founded , but it was happening much more in the South than elsewhere . Wherever it happened , though , it was from the beginning mainly a working-class interest , taken up by young men who liked fiddling with automobiles and exhibiting physical courage among their peers . <p> A notable early attempt to bring stock-car racing to wider attention was Tom Wolfe 's long article " The Last American Hero " in the March 1965 issue of Esquire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1953 to 1966 , and was thereafter involved in the sport as an owner until 1995 . One of stock-car racing 's early superstars , Johnson had perfected his skills by working as a driver for his father 's moonshine business in the Appalachian foothills , racing along remote country roads by night to outwit the " revenuers "  --  agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms . Johnson Senior was one of the biggest operators of illegal whiskey stills in the South . <p> Tom Wolfe had no difficulty getting some color out of Junior Johnson and his neighbors in Wilkes County , N.C. While insisting that " very few grits , Iron Boy overalls , clodhoppers or hats with ventilation holes up near the crown enter into this story , " Wolfe nonetheless managed to leave his readers with the impression that stock-car racing was a sport favored pretty exclusively by white Southern rustics  --  the kind of people who keep coon dogs and , in common with the late Hank Williams , believe that " hill " rhymes with " real . " Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other side of the cultural divide : " That Wolfe guy was something else . He showed up down here in Wilkes County talkin ' funny with a New York accent Wolfe is from Virginia , and wearin ' fancy clothes . " <p> Officials of NASCAR nowadays wince at this Southern-rustic image . Stock-car racing is , they insist , a sport for everyone , an inclusive sport , a family sport . For 30 years they have been trying to shake off those connotations of liquor-running good ol ' boys and big-haired women . They have had some success in spreading interest around the country , but they have not yet persuaded America 's cognitive elites to take stock-car racing seriously . This was apparent in February 2001 , when NASCAR superstar Dale Earnhardt was killed in a crash at the Daytona 500 . Earnhardt was mourned extravagantly by millions of racing fans . Meanwhile , from executive suites and faculty common rooms , from the wood-paneled corridors of prestigious law firms , from the bustling , " diversity " - obsessed editorial offices of broadsheet newspapers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ? " <p> Yet if you look at the numbers , this is not a minor sport . NASCAR 's Winston Cup , the biggest of the three " major league " series in the stock-car-racing calendar , drew 6.7 million ticketed spectators for 36 events last year , an average of 186,000 per event . By way of comparison , paid attendance for the NFL in 2002 averaged 66,000 per event , for major league baseball 28,000 , for NBA basketball 17,000 . TV viewership for a NASCAR race runs around 15 to 20 million , the same as for many major-league baseball playoff games . <p> What is it that all these people are watching ? What 's the appeal ? There must be some deep desire in the human psyche to watch human beings race vehicles round a circuit . Chariot races were , after all , an obsession of both the Romans and the Byzantines . I went to Alabama seeking enlightenment . FAR FROM DISNEY <p> Your first impression of Talladega speedway is of sheer size . The track is an approximate oval , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandstand , the opposite one seems to shimmer in the misty distance . It is in fact only three-fifths of a mile away , but appears farther because of the haze generated by huge quantities of traffic all around , and by barbecue grills on the infield . Oh , the infield  --  I had better explain about the Talladega infield . <p> The infield  --  212 acres at Talladega  --  is the interior of the oval . You get to it by driving through one of three tunnels under the track . Much of the infield is taken up with maintenance areas , garages , administrative buildings , and access roads , but the remainder  --  around 120 acres  --  is available to fans . And here they are , the hard core of stock-car-racing fandom . And here are their vehicles : Your second impression of the speedway is that you have never in your life seen so many RVs ( that is , recreational vehicles , campers ) all in one place . The infield fan areas are filled with folk who arrive typically a day or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infield . Some of the RVs are improvised . One popular model consists of an old school bus painted some improbable color , with metal railings welded around the roof so the occupants can stand up there to watch the race . <p> NASCAR 's attempts to Disneyfy their sport have made little headway in the Talladega infield . The crowd is noisy and beery . They wear denim shorts and T-shirts , baseball caps or bandannas . I see a lot of tattoos and a lot of Confederate flags . The track 's security people inspect the interior of each vehicle before allowing it to park , and I was told it has been " some years " since there was a shooting on the infield , but things still get rowdy , particularly the night before a big race . ( Among the track 's other administrative facilities is a small jail . ) Rowdy , and raunchy too : The Mardi Gras custom of beads for skin ( you give the lady a string of beads , she briefly exposes her chest ) has come up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several strings of beads round their necks  --  although , as one of my NASCAR minders noted wistfully , " The girls you 'd like to see doing it are n't the ones doing it . " <p> I watched the first few minutes of the race from the infield , near the starting line . The 43 competing vehicles circle the track slowly , two by two , behind a pace car . Each car 's position in line has been determined by pre-race qualifying laps . As they come to the starting line , the pace car pulls off the track , a green flag is waved , and the drivers throttle up to full power . Everyone had told me that this is the most thrilling moment of a race , and they did not lie . That mighty surge of engines , the even mightier roar of the crowd , the smell of gasoline and rubber , all combine into an extraordinary sensory experience . What follows is necessarily something of an anticlimax , especially as it goes on for three hours or more . The lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you get a small reprise of that starting thrill each time the pack passes your viewing point , but after half an hour or so , as the faster cars lapped the slower ones , I lost track of who was leading . <p> I wandered down to the pit area . Cars need to be refueled at several points in a 500-mile race , and wheels need to be changed . A driver loses position when he makes a pit stop , of course , and part of the strategy of racing  --  there is a great deal of strategy in this sport  --  is judging the best time to make your stops . The pit work is done with terrific dispatch , by teams who practice endlessly at shaving tenths of a second off their turnaround time . The team I watched  --  it was driver Bill Elliott 's  --  changed four wheels and refueled the car all in less than 15 seconds . They have a trick of pre-fixing the lugs in place on the replacement wheels with an elastic cement . Then , when the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bang ! , and the power wrench secures the lugs , DZ ! - DZ ! - DZ ! - DZ ! - DZ ! " Slicker ' n snot on a doorknob , " pronounced the team leader with satisfaction as Elliott vroomed away . <p> Up close the cars look surprisingly small and flimsy . Their " stock " nature is , at this point in the evolution of the sport , highly theoretical . Eligible models in the Winston Cup series are the Chevy Monte Carlo , Pontiac Grand Prix , Ford Taurus , and Dodge Intrepid , but none of the cars I saw bore much resemblance to the street models of those marques . None of their side bodywork panels paused to include a door , for instance ; the driver climbs in and out through his side window ( which has no glass ) . An owner I spoke with , who had a Monte Carlo entered in the race , described to me in loving detail how his mechanics hand-tool all the car parts in his 75,000-square-foot machine shop . I interrupted him to ask : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in ? " He looked a little flustered . " Oh , you know , they supply some parts ... the chassis design ... " <p> It is commonly said that car-racing fans go to the track in the hope of seeing a grisly crash . From my own encounters with fans on the infield and in the stands , I do n't believe this . Aside from the sensory thrills of speed and noise , and the rude social pleasures of the infield , the main appeal of the sport , for most fans , lies in rooting for their favorite drivers . Each one has some points of character , personal history , or driving style that endear him to , or repel , some section of the fan base . A few are wildly popular with practically everyone : Dale Earnhardt Sr. was , and his son , Dale Jr. , now is . ( " On account of his daddy , " a lady fan in the stands said fondly when I asked why . ) A few are widely disliked . Kurt Busch , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a villain to traditionalists , and to the kind of Southerner who believes in maintaining the exquisite manners of the region even when you are trying to kill someone . When the drivers were individually announced during the pre-race proceedings at Talladega , his name was greeted with a great outbreak of booing from the fans . SOME DEMOGRAPHICS <p> What then of those stereotypes the NASCAR suits so strenuously try to distance themselves from ? The Southern bias , for example ? Since Talladega , smack plumb in the heart of the Heart of Dixie , is the only track I have ever been to , my personal experience of the sport has not been well balanced , and I shall dutifully report that you can attend a stock-car race in any part of the country . There are major tracks in California , Kansas , and New Hampshire . The mathematician in me wants to check the numbers , though , and the numbers suggest the following broad truth : Half of this sport belongs to the South , while the other half is spread out among all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks , for example . Defining the South to be the old Confederacy plus Kentucky , of the 21 major tracks ( not counting road courses ) in the U.S. , 11 are in the South . These Southern tracks have 15.4 of the available 32 miles of roadway and 1.31 million of the total 2.46 million grandstand seats . Over a half , nearly a half , and over a half . It is the same with the 43 drivers at Talladega : I tallied 21 drivers from the South ; the next biggest regional group was from the Midwest , with 11 drivers . <p> Every one of these 43 drivers , by the way , was a white male . None had a Hispanic surname , though Christian Fittipaldi is from Sao Paulo , Brazil . The median age of the drivers was over 39  --  older than I would have expected . Every one older than 34 was married , with a median 3.5 children . <p> The Southernness , whiteness , maleness , and ( though I am going out on a limb here ) heterosexuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last June , for example , a board member of Jesse Jackson 's Rainbow/PUSH operation told reporters that stock-car racing is " the last bastion of white supremacy . " This was a counterstrike in a campaign by Jackson 's critics to get NASCAR to stop contributing to Rainbow/PUSH , on the grounds that the funds end up mostly in the pockets of Jackson , his relatives , and his mistresses . The campaign was eventually successful and NASCAR stopped their contributions . In the conversations I had at Talladega , fan approval was unanimous . <p> There was nothing racist about that approval , though . Among the celebrities introduced onstage during the pre-game show at Talladega were the current Miss America and football great Reggie White , both black . They were cheered as loudly as anyone  --  Reggie White especially so , for having taken a strong anti-Jackson line in the summer 's controversy . It is true that NASCAR fans are overwhelmingly white , but they have nothing against black people . It is only that , like much of the rest of the country , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesse Jackson and his self-enriching shakedown schemes . And although NASCAR has cut the tie with Jackson , it maintains a busy program of " diversity internships " for minority college students . <p> The reason for the paucity of black drivers and owners  --  there are a handful  --  is captured by Adam Bellow in his book In Praise of Nepotism : " In auto racing , an equipment-intensive sport with a high financial barrier to entry , it pays to have family connections . " In fact , the NASCAR personnel database reads like the First Book of Chronicles , with drivers begetting drivers and owners in apparently endless succession . <p> The social appeal of stock-car racing is wider than it used to be , and getting still wider , with college logos now featuring among the ads that festoon race-car bodywork . A sport built around such a strong network of family connections is , however , going to grow away from its roots only very gradually . This remains a conservative sport . That does not mean , of course , that its fan base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mingled with at Talladega the other day were still largely working- and lower-middle-class . If they were to lose their jobs in a major recession , they would not stop to ask whether the president in charge at the time called himself a conservative or a liberal . Likewise , while they will cheer on their commander in chief if he pursues a determined war against our nation 's enemies , they will not long tolerate U.S. fatalities in a drawn-out politicized conflict where vigorous action is restrained by deference to the opinions of foreigner hecklers or self-anointed domestic elites . <p> I am going to leave it to professional analysts to decide whether NASCAR Dads will be decisive in the 2004 elections , and just register the following impression that I brought away from Talladega with me : Whoever comes into stock-car racing , whether as driver , or owner , or fan , or political pollster , or just inquisitive outsider , will find a sport in which physical courage is admired , family bonds are treasured , the nation 's flag is honored , and the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly debated . I greatly enjoyed my day at the races . If NASCAR fans really do form a voting bloc , I would much rather they were on my side than on the other . I am glad to have made the acquaintance of a thrilling , noisy , colorful , commercial , very American sport . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By John Derbyshire <p>
