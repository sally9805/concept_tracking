Afghanistan was such a cozy home base for al-Qaeda . The network enjoyed luxuries like its own air-shuttle service , using the national airline Ariana to ship terrorist cargo and personnel , including Osama bin Laden 's bodyguards and their families , between Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf or East Africa . Sometimes al-Qaeda agents would even slip in and out of other countries disguised as Ariana flight attendants , according to aviation sources . <P> To the men who ran al-Qaeda , the rugged , war-torn wasteland of Afghanistan was a kind of paradise . Under the benevolent tolerance of the Taliban , the bosses of international terrorism found just the kind of sanctuary they needed to recruit , train and plot their deadly attacks . But by last week any members of al-Qaeda who had escaped U.S. daisy-cutter bombs and Afghan bounty hunters were on the lam and in desperate search for a new base . Besides such fugitives , there are an unknown number of operatives safely lodged in secret cells scattered from the hinterlands of Yemen to the jungles of the Philippines to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle to keep operations running and Washington moves from hunting down bin Laden to rooting out his worldwide acolytes , the next order of battle for the U.S. will be to make sure no other country offers them the kind of vital sanctuary they enjoyed in Afghanistan . <P> Even terrorists need a headquarters . The people who command and control the network  --  even one with task forces and affiliates as loose and decentralized as al-Qaeda 's  --  ca n't operate effectively for long without a communications and finance center . Most of all , they have got to have training camps where they can indoctrinate suicide attackers , explosives experts , document forgers and dedicated jihadis to replenish the terrorist ranks . Every successful mission , after all , depletes the pool . <P> Whatever new leadership emerges in al-Qaeda will be seeking a similar kind of place for a new home base  --  a secure , isolated location with a sympathetic local population and a weak central government . But it will not be easy this time . Under pressure from the U.S. or out of fear they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to sponsoring terrorism ( e.g. , Sudan , Libya ) are moving to clean up their act and countries that often turn a blind eye to terrorist groups in their midst ( e.g. , Yemen , Pakistan ) are starting to crack down . <P> The U.S. campaign to deny al-Qaeda a second life elsewhere in the world counts mainly on diplomacy , intelligence and law enforcement . Military sources tell TIME that the Pentagon has asked regional commanders to draw up plans for throttling an array of militants from the Middle East to Africa to Asia . But the basic idea is to push friendly nations and those worried about self-preservation to take out terrorist hubs . Already , Pentagon officials tell TIME , 100 U.S. special-ops commandos will deploy to train Philippine soldiers in counterterror and close-quarter battle tactics against the Abu Sayyaf insurgents who have ties to al-Qaeda . The U.S. military advisers wo n't engage in combat but will set up an " intelligence fusion center " to help clamp down on terrorist activities .
