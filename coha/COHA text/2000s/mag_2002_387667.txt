" Many homeowners do n't realize that they can take advantage of microclimates within their own gardens , " says Dalbok , whose front porch was once a drab concrete slab . A plantscape designer who travels the world to discover unusual plants and accessories , Dalbok says that it 's possible to cultivate a subtropical oasis throughout the mild-winter West . The trick is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tall plants to retain sufficient moisture throughout the garden . To set the stage for his garden , Dalbok ripped out much of the original porch and added French doors and granite columns . He replaced the concrete with colorful slate tiles and used those colors in his palette . The 8-foot-deep porch is edged by a 12-foot-long garden bed , where Dalbok planted tall banana and palm trees to act as a backdrop and provide shade for more delicate plants like maidenhair ferns . To get smaller layers in front for visual interest and as a way of framing the space , he placed bromeliads and philodendrons in a 5-foot-long wooden trough at the edge of the porch . The trough adds 2 feet of garden to the porch and offers excellent drainage for potted plants . Spots of color and luscious foliage come from large ceramic pots and containers filled with blooming plants , which are changed with the seasons . A mix of bamboo and teak furnishings and artifacts like Indonesian and African figurines complete the illusion .

A living ocotillo fence screens an unwanted view . // was designed and built by Ed Kisto , a member of the Tohono O'odham , in the authentic Southwest style . Native Americans have been constructing similar sun shelters in the Sonoran desert for centuries using natural materials . Ann always admired these traditional ramadas , but the idea of having one in her own garden occurred to her while she was working as a docent at the Arizona-Sonoran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffrey Trent , told her about Ed Kisto and his artistry as a ramada builder , and he brought the two together . Though these structures were originally used to shelter workers from hot sun during harvest time , the Lieberts ' ramada is strictly for leisure-eating pomegranates with their grandchildren or relaxing after dinner . Much as the Lieberts like using it , they also love just looking at it . " I ask you , " says Ann , " Could there be anything more Southwestern ? " gratification Use ready-made arbors to make an easy garden getaway Few landscaping projects will have more of an impact on a garden than this instant gazebo , which is based upon a structure we found at Simpson House Inn , an elegant bed-and-breakfast in Santa Barbara . Since the gazebo 's walls are four prefabricated arbors and its roof is an umbrella that rises from a garden table , there 's almost nothing to build . In just a matter of hours , you can be enjoying a meal alfresco . Build a gazebo TIME : An afternoon COST : About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nail , and flour * Four garden arbors ( we found ours at a home supply center for about $80 each ) * Paint ( optional ) * An outdoor umbrella and table sized to your space * Shovel * 1/2 cubic yard decomposed granite * 1 1/2- inch screws * 30 feet plastic or wood benderboard * Tamper * Plants NOTES Our arbors-which are 8 feet high , 2 feet deep , and 54 inches wide and came painted white  --  required some finish work : We had to bolt the tops to the legs . We also repainted the arbors a soft sage green STEPS Our gazebo forms a circle , roughly 13 feet in diameter , on a level site . An 8-foot-diameter umbrella is at the center , and the arbors stand 6 inches from the edge of the umbrella , fanning outward like spokes in a wheel . 1 . Lay out the area needed ( see plan ) using string , a nail , and flour . Draw a 9-foot-diameter circle . 2 . Determine the main entry point and lay out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four main points on a compass . Remember that the openings will likely be 54 inches wide ( but check the width of your arbors ' openings ) . 3 . Open the umbrella to determine the height of the outer rim . You 'll want to set each of the arbors in gravel-filled holes so their peaks will be at the same height . ( Here , the height is 7 feet. ) 4 . Dig holes for arbor legs , place gravel in bottom , and insert the legs . Check that the sides are vertical and remain evenly spaced . 5 . Screw an inner rim of benderboard to the front of the arbors that rises about 1 inch above ground level . This creates a low retaining wall for gravel . 6 . Pack more gravel around the legs and fill the center area with decomposed granite . Dampen and compact the granite with a tamper . 7 . Plant . We 've trained star jasmine up the arbors and planted annuals in the remaining space .

Photograph The greatest appeal of this do-it-yourself gazebo-aside from the ease of construction-is that it creates a personal space that can be tucked into a lush garden setting or set on its own on a large lawn or meadow . // Container gardening makes a great space anywhere By Steven R. Lorton Only one summer old , this lush Seattle roof garden is well on its way to becoming this family 's favorite close-to-home hideout . Though most homeowners ' getaways would more likely be a cantilevered deck or a patio , this rooftop provides lots of lessons in container gardening . Four things made it come together quickly and easily : large containers , 60-pound bags of potting mix , the availability of water-piping and an outdoor spigot were installed-and an enthusiastic owner . He makes daily rounds , watering and snipping off faded blooms and damaged foliage . When winter sets in , he 'll cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from pots , and replace it with fresh mix . He 's hoping that the big plants will stay happy for a decade . Create a garden on a deck * Get creative with containers . The rooftop garden uses big glazed pots , imported from China and Vietnam , chosen for their size and bright colors . High-fired and glazed , these pots wo n't crack in winter . Be sure to fill them with a rich , sterile potting mix . Photograph Full of lessons for decks and patios , this 15- by 25  --  foot Seattle garden sits atop a two  --  story addition built on the side of a three-story house ; it gets a great deal of sunshine , including bright afternoon light . // * Feed and water frequently . Plant roots quickly use up the nutrients in the small amount of soil in containers , so you have to feed often ( every two weeks with half  --  strength liquid fertilizer ) and water as soon as soil starts to dry out to keep things growing . * Freely mix annuals and permanent plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geranium ) for visual continuity throughout the garden . * Do n't be afraid to try trees and shrubs in containers . The rooftop 's denizens even include a crape myrtle . Smaller pots in various shapes and sizes are filled with small shrubs and woody plants : Algerian ivy , heather , Hebe , hypericum , and others . * Use upright perennials such as gerbera , golden marguerite , and snapdragon for exclamation points of color . * Employ tender perennials and annuals , like zinnia and helichrysum , as flowery fillers . PATIO Watching the garden grow Proper design and location make a patio a front row seat to nature By Mary Jo Bowling " Decks are architectural integrators ; patios are landscape integrators , " says landscape architect John Kenyon . " With a deck you have a rail and height separating you from the landscape . On the patio there 's nothing between you and nature . " A patio can go anywhere on the lot-even off a small greenhouse facing the vegetable garden . Kenyon says watching vegetables grow is like watching television for gardeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes other plantings seem static . It 's fun to sit back , watch it happen , and appreciate your hard work , " he says . To soften the pavers and add interest to the space , Kenyon placed perennials around the irregular 8- by 8foot stone shape . Willow trees ( Salix integra ' Hakuro Nishiki ' ) and fuchsia ( F x hybrida ) add height and screen the greenhouse . Bronze New Zealand flax ( Phormium tenax ) adds a splash of color , and large squash leaves make the transition between patio and vegetable garden . " It is the most successful spot in this garden , " says Kenyon . " Everyone ends up hanging out there . " DESIGN : Sundance Landscaping Design/Build , Redmond , WA ( 425/881-5518 or **27;1177;TOOLONG ) Plan a patio * Choose the site carefully . Because the patio puts you close to the garden , locate it in an interesting area-facing a view of your garden or of rolling hills , for example . Photograph This small patio works , thanks to the dappled light and the partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foliage . The casual comfort of the two chairs seems to invite relaxation and intimate conversation . // * Define the space . Use plants to create leafy walls for privacy and a sense of place . Tuck ground covers between pavers to create a living carpet underfoot . * Establish a color scheme . Coordinate your colors with those in the surrounding area-the colors of your exterior walls , flowering shrubs , or trees-or if you want the patio to be an extension of an interior room , borrow from that room 's palette . * Choose materials carefully . In the garden above , designer John Kenyon used a mix of tumbled concrete pavers and bluestone for a more aged appearance . The color mix , along with the Corsican mint growing between the pavers , adds texture , color , and pattern to the area . * Provide seating . Be sure to group chairs , benches , or other pieces of outdoor furniture so that people can see each other and comfortably converse . * Add finishing touches . Consider a fountain for the soothing sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art tucked among the plants to both surprise and amuse .

But when it comes to moving the equivalent of the living room sofa to the back patio , you can be stumped by the narrow selection of outdoor furniture . This season , outdoor furniture makers are introducing products that take seating to a new level . Photograph A simple chair may be all you need to create a temporary retreat outdoors . Michael Thompson set his wicker furnishings ( from an import store ) within easy view of a ' Trude Webster ' rhododendron 's shimmery pink trusses. // Furnish your retreat Sidebar Create an exotic retreat Sidebar * Use overhanging eaves and awnings , large trees , or decorative elements like umbrellas to provide partial shade . * Use troughs and containers to bring the garden onto a patio or deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed by your porch or deck . * Always layer plants , using tall ones in the back and smaller ones in front to create different levels to stop the eye and enrich the composition . Experiment with plant combinations and container placement before making final decisions . * Rotate showy plants , such as orchids , begonias , and bromeliads , into your garden for color all year . * Let plants grow full and loose so your garden always looks lush . Sidebar * Pay close attention to watering subtropical plants . Some need more moisture than others . Bromeliads , for example , can survive up to a week without water , whereas maidenhair ferns need watering at least twice a week . * Look for exotic accessories in your local stores-many now stock reproductions of antique statuary and wood carvings at reasonable prices .
