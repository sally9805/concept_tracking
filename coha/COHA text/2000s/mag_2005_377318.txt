Inspiration is a rare and flighty bird . Most of us never catch a glimpse of it . Very occasionally it settles down helpfully in the corner , cawing advice to artists as they pile up those bodies of work on which their hopes of immortality rest . More usually  --  and this was the case with Arthur Miller  --  it touches down briefly , then darts away . The artist may catch tantalizing sight of the creature as he walks on through the woods , but it never again perches long on his shoulder . <P> It was in the spring of 1947 that the 31-year-old Arthur Miller heard the sweetest  --  and most profound  --  birdsong of his life . After a decade of struggle he had finally achieved a hit Broadway play , All My Sons , and with its proceeds bought a farm in Roxbury , Conn . Leaving his family behind in Brooklyn , he repaired to the country , built himself a cabin-studio ( he was a great carpenter ) , settled down at a crude desk he had also fashioned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new play in mind , and some thoughts about its tragic theme  --  a man selling his soul and eventually his life to the false values of materialist America . By the wee hours he had completed the first draft of the first act of the play that was eventually known as Death of a Salesman . <P> The rest took a little longer  --  about six weeks  --  not counting production rewrites . But Elia Kazan , then his best friend , and perhaps always his best director , was correct when he wrote that Miller " did n't write Death of a Salesman ; he released it . " Not a week has passed since the play premiered on Broadway 56 years ago this month when it was not playing somewhere in the world , playing too on our instinctive response to an instinctive work . <P> On opening night a woman told Miller his play was " a time bomb under American capitalism , " and he hoped she was right . But if it were just a matter of politics ( Miller was at the time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted . His protagonist , Willy Loman , however , is an Everyman , someone who heedlessly believes all the lies that are fed to us  --  the ones about success and self-realization , the ones about consumerism , the ones about the necessity of being , as he puts it , " well liked . " At the time , the fancier critics thought Willy lacked the noble stature for tragedy . But that 's nonsense . We do n't live in an Aristotelian age ; we live in the age of Donald Trump . And Willy , trying to pass on his false values to his sons ( and incidentally destroying them as a result ) , has become an ever more poignant , and prescient , figure .
