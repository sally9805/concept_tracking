Prologue Miz Cleo <p> Summertime is hell in Bentley Manor . The Georgia heat is enough to drive you mad and folks around here start actin ' like they 's ai n't got no sense . I 've seen a lot in my seventy-three years and I 've experienced pain I would n't wish on my worse enemy . But heartache is nothing new in Bentley Manor . In fact , it comes with the territory . <p> As I sit out here on this stoop with my best friend Osceola Washington by my side , I look around this U-shaped complex marveling how it 's getting harder and harder to tell the days apart . I 've been living here since June of ' 69 . Lost my husband in ' 71 . After raising four children , one grandchild , I 'm now strugglin ' to raise my great-grandbaby . <p> It 's hard . <p> And I 'm tired . <p> Over the years , or rather , over the decades , Atlanta has gone through some changes . Bentley Manor started off as regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the ghetto , in the late ' 80s the projects . Now , it 's the hood . <p> This place is crawling with the worst of the worst and I 've seen my fair share of pimps , dealers , playas , and killers . Too many , in fact . <p> Some wonder how people survive places like Bentley Manor . To that , I can only shrug my shoulders and ask " what choice do we have ? " <p> The hood life is all we know .... <p> Copyright 2009 by Niobia Bryant and Adrianne Byrd <p> 1 The Pimp <p> Pussy is big business . <p> And I 'm a businessman  --  a damn good one . Yeah , I dibble and dabble in a few other things . Who does n't ? If a nigga wants to carve himself a piece of the American pie , he 's got to get his hustle on . You feel me ? I 'm sure you do . Tavon Johnson is the name and pussy is my game . <p> ' Course , on the streets they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So much so that each of my girls keeps their pussy shaved and sport diamond tattoos inches above their clits . I want my customers to know they 're getting diamond quality . <p> If you 're wondering how I got into this business , I guess you could say I sort of fell into it . I popped my first cherry at twelve . Her name was Renee Collins . I swear to this day that she has the sweetest pussy a nigga ever tasted . And ' course I bragged this shit to my best friend Destin . Bragged so much that he promised to give me his allowance for a full month if I let him have a go at Renee himself . <p> Being an entrepreneurial nigga even at that age , I took the deal  --  only if I was allowed to watch . Hell , Destin 's parents gave him five dollars a week , and in ' 82 you have no idea how many hours of pinball that gave a nigga . <p> Renee was pissed , but it had been easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much she loved me . I got ta tell ya : watching her in action with my best friend was an incredible high . Watching her do a few more boys behind the schoolyard and under the gym bleachers convinced me that I really did love her . <p> All in all , it was just another reason in a long list of why I married her . For the record , she still has the sweetest pussy I 've ever tasted . <p> So what 's your fantasy ? I have every kind of ho you can imagine : Black , white , Puerto Rican or Asian . You name it , I got it . You want a streetwalker , a glamorous escort , a porno star , or maybe you 're one of those down-low brothers . Do n't matter . I got a few dicks on the payroll , too . It 's all pussy to me . <p> Being in the biz for a quarter , I 've seen it all . You can whip them , tie them up , and you can even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all negotiable . But do n't get it twisted ; pimpin ' ai n't easy . <p> From time to time I catch whiff of a few girls talking ' bout how they 're going to leave . I laugh at that shit . Where the fuck are they going to go ? What are they going to do , shovel fries at McDonald 's , convince one of their johns to marry them ? C'm on . Once a ho always a ho . <p> Besides , they 're not going to find another nigga that 's going to treat them better than I do . Like the Disciple Curtis Mayfield said : " I 'm their momma , I 'm their daddy , I 'm that nigga in the alley . " <p> I 'd be lyin ' if I said from time to time one does n't leave the nest ... but they come back . They always come back . Bottom line : they love me , they hate me , they love me . I can live with that . <p> As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to my success . While all these ashy Negroes scramble around tryna turn everybody and their momma into crackheads , I 'm building an empire off the best commodity there is  --  and I do mean the best . <p> From rap stars to government officials , I keep the juices and the money flowing . <p> I grew up poor and I ai n't never going back . Fuck that shit . <p> Of course , I do n't whine and moan like most . A sad story in Bentley Manor is a dime a dozen . We do n't need anyone to tell us that we got the short end of the stick . The question is : How are you going to play the hand you were dealt ? Me ? I did n't choose pimpin ' . Pimpin ' chose me . The first girl I had to protect was my own damn momma . <p> Now , some men have a problem havin ' a ho for a momma . Not me . I recognize my momma did what she had to do to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with different daddies ) , and I ai n't got nothin ' but mad respect for her game . Of course , for a long time , she lied to us and to herself by telling us that the men who marched in and out of our apartment were good friends of the family  --  friends who left money on the bedside table after they " wrestled naked in her bed . " <p> Once , my older brother , Kadrian , and I hid under her bed and found out what really went on in that room when she closed the door . And let me tell ya : Momma had skills . Niggas would call out her name like she was Christ Almighty . A lot of them brought her gifts and some even thought to bring us something , too . <p> For a few years , we were the envy of most our friends : sportin ' the new canvas sneaks , rockin ' the latest dookey rope chains and carrying the biggest boom boxes imaginable . Then crack hit the streets and Momma got hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't last long . <p> Soon , thugs and drug dealers replaced the niggas with money . Our fly-ass gear disappeared about as fast as the food in the refrigerator . Within three months , Momma was out on the streets , offering to suck dicks just for a hit . Some started beating on her . The strange thing was she acted like she did n't care . All she wanted was to get high . <p> Well , I cared . And nobody was gon na whup my momma 's ass right in front of me or my hood . So me and my brother started looking out for her  --  collecting her money , making sure that she got paid . <p> Hell , we had to eat . <p> This arrangement pretty much went on through our teen years . But all our protecting could n't prevent her from coming up HIV positive a couple years ago . That fuckin ' sex fiend Junior spread that shit to a lot of girls when he was stayin ' up at Bentley Manor . If his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have . <p> But live and learn . All my girls get tested on the regular and I screen their johns like the motherfuckin ' FBI . What can I say ? I have to protect my investment . <p> My three sisters , Candy , Brandi , and Cherry , followed our mother 's footsteps . They call themselves Video Vixens now , but you know , a ho by any other name ... <p> Me , I keep doing what I 'm good at : protecting and selling pussy . <p> My big brother , Kadrian , did n't make it out of his teens . He got caught up in gangbanging and took a couple of bullets to the chest . Not a day goes by when I do n't think about him , wishing he was here counting this money with me . <p> Pimpin ' ai n't like what you see in the movies . Sure there are some guys who walk around draped in gaudy jewelry , iron-pressed curls , and dress like it 's 1972 , but those are little boys fulfilling their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress like any other CEO of a Fortune 500 company . Ten-thousand-dollar suits from William Fioravanti , Caraceni , and Oxxford , with a little tasteful bling from De Beers and my ass look ready for the cover of GQ every day . <p> " I 'm sorry , sir , " Anderson , my driver , says over his shoulder . " Does n't look like this traffic is gon na let up anytime soon . " <p> I pull my gaze from a So-So Def billboard to meet his eyes in the Bentley 's rearview mirror . " Take your time . I 'm not in a hurry . " <p> He nods and I return my attention to that ridiculous billboard and continue reflecting over my life  --  all thirty-seven years of it . <p> It was n't easy , but I finally got my girls off the street corner . Found safer ways for us all to do our jobs . Yeah , I own a couple of private strip clubs , book a couple of booty-shaking dancers for rap stars and keep a hefty amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my back . <p> All of this is good money , but it all pales in comparison to what I make off the Red Light District Web site : videos , CD-ROMS , DVD , Video on Demand , and sex toys . Again , name your pleasure and I can hook you up . <p> After all , I 'm a freak , too . <p> At long last , my nut sack starts tingling . I close my eyes and loll my head back to give the mouth around my cock a little more room . <p> " That 's it . Do n't stop , " I moan and pump my hips . Out of all my girls , including Renee , no one sucks my dick the way Destiny does . No one . I place my hand on the back of her long flowing weave and bob her head down to a faster rhythm . <p> Shit . I 'm ready to come and I know this trick is gon na swallow my full load and then keep sucking until my toes curl . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I growl as I hold her head down and finally explode into that wonderful mouth . <p> Like a true sex soldier , Destiny keeps going and I start to inch up the leather upholstery because my shit is suddenly sensitive . Finally , I have to shove her off and try to catch my breath . <p> Destiny chuckles and reaches for her purse to retrieve her compact and lipstick . " I do n't know how Renee is still number one when she ca n't deep throat like I do . " <p> I tuck my dick back into my pants and stare at her as she fixes her makeup . Well , technically , she is a he and quite possibly the best damn transvestite I 've ever seen . <p> I do n't question my sexuality  --  and nobody else does either . I do whateva gets me off . The world would be a better place if everyone did the same . <p> Destiny snaps her compact closed and smiles . " Feel better , baby ? " <p> " As always , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a fleeting moment , I 'm sure I see disgust reflect in his eyes . <p> " Destiny , " I say , maintaining eye contact with my driver . " Climb up front and hook Anderson up for me . " <p> " That 's not necessary , Mr. Johnson , " Anderson sputters immediately . <p> " I know it 's not necessary , but what can I say , I 'm a generous guy . And I do n't like it when people turn down my generosity  --  especially people who work for me . " <p> Without a doubt this nigga understands that his options are to get his dick wet or get the fuck out in the middle of rush-hour traffic . <p> Destiny watches the exchange in amused silence and when I give her a small wink , she climbs over into the front seat and unzips Anderson 's pants . <p> " Well , you ai n't got much to work with . Do you , honey ? " Destiny asks . <p> Anderson 's face darkens . <p> I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wreck my shit . " <p> This time , horror covers Anderson 's face and I keep on laughing . <p> A couple of slurps and this motherfucker lays on the brakes and starts cumin ' . <p> " Damn , man . I barely got started . " Destiny drops her fake feminine voice for a sec and her masculine bass fills the car . <p> Anderson looks as if he 'd just been raped or some shit . Maybe he 's stunned that he enjoyed the experience . Like I said : Destiny 's the best . <p> Nearly an hour later , we roll through Bentley Manor 's wrought-iron gate . My attention is instantly drawn to the trembling crackheads and hustling dope dealers . And sure enough , sitting out on their concrete stoop , in the center of the U-shaped complex , are Miz Cleo and Miz Osceola . Hell , I can feel their glares before I even get out of the car . <p> Fuck ' em . They do n't like me and I sure as hell do n't give a shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this motherfucker since I grew up here . It 's just as dirty and grimy as ever . <p> Anderson hops his fat ass out the driver 's seat and quickly opens my back door . I climb out , pose a bit so everyone can take their time eyeing my summer-white suit and customized bling . <p> What 's the point of having money if you ca n't show it off ? <p> A few dealers bob their heads in greeting and way too many underage girls try to catch my attention . But I ai n't lookin ' at shit that ai n't eighteen . <p> Period . <p> Destiny starts to climb out of the car , but I quickly tell her , " Stay put . I 'll be back in a sec . " I clutch the head of my silver-handled cane ( one stereotype I wo n't give up ) and stroll like the pimp I am toward my old childhood building . <p> When Momma answers her door , I have to hand it to her : she 's looking pretty good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her HIV cocktails . <p> " Hey , baby . " She tightens the belt on her robe and leans up on her tiptoes to deliver a kiss against my cheek . " I did n't know you were coming by today . " <p> " I always come by on the fifteenth , " I say , strolling through the door . I 'm not the least surprised to see a john sitting on the couch . After all , Momma is always gon na be Momma . <p> " Well , I guess I better get going , " the dude says , jumping to his feet and scrambling toward the door . <p> I stop him cold . " Are n't you forgetting something ? " I ask . <p> He glances at Momma and then back at me while getting all flustered . <p> " Uh , yeah . " He reaches for his wallet in his back pocket and peels off a couple of Benjamins . " My bad . " <p> I just nod , but I make sure he reads in my expression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Angel , " the man says and quickly races out the door . <p> I turn my gaze toward Momma . " Angel ? " <p> " What ? Do n't I look like an Angel to you ? " <p> I just laugh at that shit . Momma ai n't ever gon na change . And neither will I. " All right , Angel . You got my money ? " <p> Copyright 2009 by Niobia Bryant and Adrianne Byrd <br> Continues ...
