' T is a vile thing to die , my gracious lord , When men are unprepar 'd and look not for it . LONDON , APRIL 1830 <p> Lady Phaedra Northampton made her way down to Charing Cross , her strides long and purposeful  --  mannish , her mother would have chided  --  as she weaved her way through the afternoon jumble of bureaucrats and shopkeepers . All of them had seemingly set off in search of luncheon at once , crisscrossing her path in a sharp-elbowed frenzy as if conspiring to impede her march across Westminster . But sharp elbows were the least of her concerns . <p> Desperation  --  and a rash , reckless idea  --  had driven her from the house , and despite the chill , Phaedra had left Mayfair without a hat . How foolish . And how unlike her . Now she pushed back the high collar of her heavy gray cloak , cutting a glance over her shoulder . Just behind Phaedra , her maid scurried along , a hand clasped to the top of her bonnet against the wintry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , then , did the hair on the back of her neck keep prickling so ? Phaedra tucked her portfolio closer , and picked up her step . <p> " Ooh , miss , do slow down ! " Agnes complained . " I want to find Millie as bad as you , but I 'm taking a stitch . " <p> Phaedra glanced back , realizing in some shame that her maid had been practically trotting since they 'd left Brook Street . Checking her pace , she noticed a familiar black and yellow barouche pulled to the pavement ahead . Drat . <p> Agnes , too , saw it . " That 'll be Lady Blaine , miss , " she said warningly . <p> Lady Blaine , indeed ! To Phaedra , she was still Eliza , a little slip of a girl from their home village . Unfortunately , there was no avoiding her . <p> " Do you think she knows the truth about Priss , ma'am ? " Agnes 's voice trembled . " Or that Millie 's gone missing ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence than she felt . <p> " Phae ! Oh , Phae ! " The wheedling cry rang from the door of a milliner 's shop . Eliza came with unfashionable haste toward them , her husband staggering in her wake with a stack of bandboxes which nearly reached his nose . The girl wore a dress of yellow trimmed in deep green , and a green cloak which was a bit insufficient for the weather . The cloak 's collar was turned up at a jaunty angle , and embroidered with a chain of white and yellow daises which , Phae inwardly considered , looked hideous , and a little silly . <p> " Phae , what luck ! " said Eliza . " When did you arrive in London ? Why did you not tell me ? " <p> " Good afternoon , Eliza . " Phaedra spoke cordially if a little hurriedly . " We came up some weeks past . " <p> " Oh , how exciting for you ! " Eliza had drawn up in front of them , eyes wide . " How very weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole winter . " <p> " Actually , I prefer Hamp  --  " <p> " But London , Phae ! " Eliza interjected . " And the season ! I have scarcely left Town , you know , since my marriage last autumn . " She shot a doting glance back at Blaine , a minor baronet so young his forehead was still pimpled . Phae almost suggested he lift the bandboxes higher . <p> But Eliza was quivering with excitement . " Listen , Phae ! I have quite the greatest news ever . Guess ! Guess ! " <p> " Why , I could not possibly , " said Phaedra . <p> " Oh , just try ! " Eliza was almost hopping up and down with excitement . <p> This was the point at which , of course , Eliza would announce that she was enceinte . Phaedra had been through this little post-season ritual many times . " Just tell me , Lizzie . " She forced a smile . " I know I will be very happyfor yo  --  " <p> " We 're to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift , explosive hug . " The last Thursday in April ! " She set Phaedra a little away . " Now you all must come , Phae ! Do say that you will ? " <p> " You know I do not go out much , Lizzie , " she said quietly . " I thank you for asking . Mamma and Phoebe will be thrilled to come , I am quite sure . " <p> Eliza 's lower lip came out . " Phae , you really are not so firmly on the shelf as all that ! " she said . " Indeed , I am quite persuaded that this shall be your year . " <p> " I do not need a year . " Phaedra smiled . " Besides , Eliza , this is to be Phoebe 's year . " <p> " I can not think , then , why you bother to come each season if you think Town pursuits so very silly . " <p> " And let Mamma come alone ? " The words slipped out before Phaedra could bite them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eliza blinked innocently . " There 's Phoebe . They would be together . " <p> Yes , thought Phaedra grimly , and together they would find twice as much trouble . <p> But she was being churlish . She gave Eliza another hug . " Do get in your carriage now , " she said , urging the girl toward it . " That cloak is not warm enough to stand here gabbing . Come round for tea next week . Phee will wish you to see all her new finery . " <p> Eliza 's eyes lit up . " Why , I should be pleased to offer my sense of Town style , " she said , stroking her gloved fingertips over her daisies . " How excited the dear child must be . Why , I remember my first season as if it were yesterday . " <p> " That 's because it was yesterday , " Agnes muttered behind her . <p> In short order , Lord Blaine had tucked his bride back into their carriage , and secured a rug across her knees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ugly cloak , " Agnes complained as the carriage drew away . " But she 's right about one thing . " <p> " I ca n't think what , " said Phaedra , resuming her march toward the Strand . <p> " This could be your year . " <p> Phaedra cut a stern glance over her shoulder . " Do n't be ridiculous , Agnes , " she said . " Every year is my year . " <p> She was distracted suddenly by a figure in a dark topcoat and an odd , fur-trimmed hat . He pushed away from the shelter of a doorway far to her right , then his head turned toward Agnes and he stiffened . At that instant a black and red mail coach came clattering up from Charing Cross , fresh horses prancing wildly , passengers clinging to the roof , the box , and all but bursting out the doors . When the dust and clatter were gone , the doorway  --  a tobacconist 's  --  was perfectly empty . She had not even seen his face . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What man , miss ? " <p> " I thought  --  " Phaedra shook off the ill feeling . " No , it was no one , I daresay . " <p> Good heavens , she was becoming as fanciful as Phoebe and Mamma . Phaedra forced herself to stroll down to the Strand . She passed her favorite bookseller 's  --  a tatty little shop that sold musty volumes of history and geography . Beyond that was a brass shop where one could buy candlesticks , pokers , and firedogs . A stationer 's . A coffin maker and , next door  --  incongruously  --  a pie seller , his window trays rapidly emptying . Phaedra turned right into the doorway of a bay-windowed shop , pausing just long enough to read the shop 's only marking , a discreet brass plaque : MR . GEORGE JACOB KEMBLE <br> PURVEYOR OF ELEGANT ODDITIES AND FINE FOLDEROL <p> Agnes , too , hesitated . " He might be dining at such an hour , might n't he ? " <p> " Then we shall simply wait . " Phaedra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have faith , Agnes . It is possible Mr. Kemble can help us find your sister . " <p> Overhead , a discreet little bell jangled as Phaedra 's feet sank into an impossibly thick Turkish carpet . Inside , the shop smelled faintly of camphor , polish , and of the vinegar which was doubtless used to shine the glistening acres of glass cases . Phaedra 's gaze swept over a row of Imari vases , a collection of Meissen figurines , and an entire shelf of bejeweled perfume flacons . Oriental carpets hung from the walls , chandeliers dotted the ceiling , and suits of armor were tucked into the corners . <p> " Mercy , " said Agnes . " Looks as if half o ' Blenheim Palace got shoved in here . " <p> Just then Phaedra 's quarry appeared from the rear of the shop , throwing open a pair of heavy velvet panels with more drama than was strictly necessary , and setting the brass curtain rings to jangling . Mr. Kemble was a lithe , elegant man of indeterminate years with quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little on edge . " Good afternoon , Kemble . " <p> A strange expression passed over his face . " Lady Phaedra Northampton ! " he said . " And in my humble shop , no less . " <p> " I wish a moment with you privately , Kemble , " she said , laying her portfolio atop one of the glass cases . " A pressing personal matter which  --  " <p> The door jangled again . All eyes turned to the slight , dark young woman who entered , her jet eyebrows snapped together . She wore a gown of striped yellow muslin under a sweeping green cloak . Her maid had been left standing just outside the door . <p> " Hullo , George , " she said , nodding at Phaedra as she passed . <p> " Miss Armstrong , " said Kemble smoothly , coming at once from behind the counter . " To what do I owe the pleasure ? " <p> " George , I want another of those heads , " she said bluntly . <p> Kemble folded his hands neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you already have a head , " he answered . " God only knows the trouble you 'd get into if you had a second . " <p> " Lud , not that sort of head , " she said , passing easily over the insult . " The white china sort , like the one Papa pitched through the window last year . It was one of the Georges , but I ca n't think which . " <p> " Ah , the Chaffer bust of George II , " said Kemble knowingly . " My dear child , I do not uncrate those by the box load , you know . The Chaffer was rare . And since the marquess saw fit to destroy it in his little temper tantrum , I fear you must all bear its absence stoically . " <p> " What , you ca n't just get us another ? " The girl 's black brows snapped back together . " Good Lord , George . It 's his birthday . " <p> A sort of verbal fencing match ensued , the girl insisting rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head if he had n't one in stock , and Mr. Kemble parrying just as tartly that he might as easily steal the Marquess of Rannoch a modicum of self-control , and they 'd all be the better for it . <p> Bemused , Phaedra watched , making several observations at once . Firstly , that the girl had a temper  --  probably got honestly from her father if he 'd thrown such a masterpiece as a Chaffer porcelain through a window . Secondly , that the girl was called " Miss " but her father was a marquess , which meant she was either adopted or illegitimate . And lastly , that the girl was dressed to the nines in Parisian fashions which had cost someone a bloody fortune  --  but unfortunately , she had topped the gorgeous ensemble with a cloak embroidered in daisies just like Eliza 's . It seems so oddly incongruous on such a dark , elegant creature , and with her nerves already on edge , Phaedra let out a little burst of laughter . Swiftly , she slapped her hand over her mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl and Mr. Kemble turning to look at her . <p> But Phaedra was saved by the ring of another bell , this time not the door , but a loud clang-clang-clang that seemed to come from above . A hand bell , Phaedra thought . <p> " George  --  ? " boomed a disembodied voice from somewhere above them . " George ? What 's Jane done with my book now ? " There was a muffled series of bumps , then the sound of glass shattering . <p> " Oh , Lord ! " Kemble cast an exasperated gaze upward . " The Sevres teacup . " <p> " It 's Maurice again , " said Miss Armstrong irritably . " I swear , George , I have never seen a man savor a broken ankle so . " <p> As Phaedra wondered who Maurice might be , Mr. Kemble gave a tight smile , and turned to bow toward Phaedra . " Ladies , I do beg your pardon . It is the housekeeper 's half-day and Jean-Claude is at the post office . I shall be but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains , this time leaving them open to reveal a staircase to the right . Through the curtains Phaedra could see a rear entrance flanked with windows , and several worktables set about a cavernous back room . They watched as Mr. Kemble 's elegant trouser hems disappeared up the steps . <p> Miss Armstrong turned to Phaedra and smiled warmly . Phaedra returned the greeting , but hers was a perfunctory smile . She knew Miss Armstrong 's type . Pretty and vivacious . Fashionable and flirtatious . The ton was littered with their beauty , and with the almost-beauties like Eliza , none of them with two thoughts in their heads worth speaking aloud . Amidst her contemplation , however , Phaedra realized Miss Armstrong was ... well , quivering . <p> " You were laughing at me ! " she declared . <p> Heat washed over Phaedra 's face . " I beg your pardon ? " <p> " You were laughing , " Miss Armstrong repeated . " At my cloak , I daresay . " <p> " Why , I  --  I was not , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the girl answered on a strange gurgle . <p> " No , please , I  --  " Phaedra realized the girl was choking back laughter . <p> Miss Armstrong burst into giggles . " I daresay I can not blame you ; it 's perfectly hideous . " Her eyes danced with merriment . " But my aunt Winnie chose it , and I have n't worn it once , and now she 's taken notice . So I said to my self , well , it 's only George , and after all , he must have something to poke fun at , must n't he ? " <p> " Oh , " said Phaedra vaguely . " Yes , I daresay . " <p> But Miss Armstrong was surveying her more closely now . " I 'm sorry , " she managed . " Have we met ? " <p> " I think not . " But politely , Phaedra extended her hand . " Lady Phaedra Northampton . How do you do ? " <p> To her shock , Miss Armstrong squeezed her hand almost affectionately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm Zod . Zod Armstrong  --  and I do know you , come to think on it . Your mother lives opposite Aunt Winnie in Brook Street . I often stay with her during the season . " <p> " Yes , we reside there when we are in Town , " Phaedra replied . " Along with my brother , Anthony Hayden-Worth . " <p> " Oh , yes ! " said Zod brightly . " Mrs. Hayden-Worth left him and went back to America , did she not ? A pity , that . One hates to see such a desperately good-looking man going to waste . " <p> Phaedra blinked at the girl uncertainly . She was frightfully plain-spoken , but what she said was perfectly true  --  except that Tony was n't exactly going to waste . It might be better for all of them if he were . Then Phaedra and Agnes would not be here , dealing with the aftermath , and searching for a needle in a haystack . " Actually , Tony has gone to America , too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorce . " <p> " Indeed ? " Zod did not look shocked . " Such things are easier done there , I daresay . " <p> Suddenly Phaedra 's thoughts were distracted by something  --  a shadow , she thought , hovering at one of Mr. Kemble 's rear windows . She glanced toward it , and just as quickly , it was gone . Perhaps there had been nothing at all . <p> But Miss Armstrong was still speaking . " In any case , I used to see you coming home from your morning walk , " she continued . " How refreshed and brisk you always looked . At that hour , I am still languishing in my nightclothes , of course , and drinking my chocolate . But I do so admire your zeal . " <p> Phaedra was still trying to figure out Zod Armstrong when a faint noise sounded at the back door  --  a sort of whimper and scrape , like a dog wanting to be let in . A vagrant in the alleyway , perhaps . She turned back to Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her rarely gave Phaedra 's sort a second glance , writing them off as bluestockings , wallflowers , or just hopelessly unfashionable . <p> Phaedra was all of those things , she supposed . Indeed , she had embraced them . <p> But Miss Armstrong seemed to find her interesting , and was rattling off an almost apologetic story about how her father had come to break the Chaffer bust in a fit of temper over her cousin Frederica 's having fallen for a terrible rake . But Frederica and the rake had married and , it seemed , were living happily ever after . Phaedra had missed most of the details in between . <p> " And now that my stepmother is with child again , " Miss Armstrong finished brightly , " I 'm to stay with Aunt Winnie for the season . Papa is hoping quite desperately that this year I will take  --  but this is my second season  --  well , my third , almost . And I 've been in Town most of my life . I really do think it is quite hopeless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which suggested Miss Armstrong was in no way cast down by her lack of marital prospects . The girl went up another notch in Phaedra 's eyes . As to Zod 's eyes , they were not just animated , but sparkled with a keen intelligence with which Phaedra would not first have credited her . <p> " I daresay I could go in the afternoons , " Phaedra blurted out . <p> Miss Armstrong lifted her eyebrows . " Could you ? Where ? " <p> " For my walk , I mean , " she answered , feeling a little silly . " If you wish to take some exercise , I could go in the afternoon . I ... I no longer walk in the mornings anyway . " That was not wholly true , but Phaedra did not elaborate . <p> Miss Armstrong 's face lit with pleasure . " Why , how very kind you are . " <p> " And I was n't laughing at your cloak , " Phaedra hastily added . " It 's just that , well , a friend of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wearing one just like it not ten minutes past . " <p> " No  --  ! " said Miss Armstrong hotly . " You ca n't mean it . " <p> " I fear so , " said Phaedra , edging ever so slightly into the girlish spirit . " And the two of you are as different as chalk from cheese . " <p> Miss Armstrong 's face had darkened . " Devil take Madame Germaine ! " she swore . " I knew that old hag had shifty eyes . An original design , indeed ! She knows very well I sha n't wear so much as a garter if someone else has one like it . " <p> " I 'm very sorry , " said Phaedra contritely . <p> " Well , do n't be , " said Miss Armstrong . " Now I have a reason never to wear the silly thing again . Daisies , indeed ! " <p> Just then , the bump at the door came again  --  several bumps , in fact , like a slow dirge . <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green curtains to call up the stairs . " George  --  ? George ! I think you 've got a delivery at the rear . " <p> Phaedra followed her into the back , looking curiously over the workroom as Agnes tentatively trailed behind . <p> Zod had a hand on her hip , glowering up the stairs . " Oh , bother , " she repeated as the thump came again . " Let 's just open it . " <p> But as Zod stepped toward it , the door suddenly gave , the hasp flying back with a crack ! A hunched form in a dark coat came staggering in . A gray muffler slithered to his feet , stained blood-red . Eyes wide and glassy , the man collapsed , his knees buckling . He toppled onto the floor along with his fur hat , something tumbling from his outstretched hand as he fell . <p> Behind them Agnes stifled a scream . <p> A thick wooden knife handle protruded from between his shoulder blades . <p> " Good God ! " said Miss Armstrong , drawing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried . " Oh , George ! You 'd best get down here now ! " <p> Her hand over her mouth , Phaedra sank down beside the bleeding man . The man near the tobacconist . The hat ... and his face . Oh , dear Lord . Fighting down a surge of panic , Phaedra stripped off her glove and set her fingers beneath his ear . <p> " Oh , lawks a'mighty ! " whispered Agnes . " ' E looks like ' e 's ... oh , gawd ! " <p> " Hush , Agnes , " Phaedra ordered . <p> " But , oh , miss ! " Agnes wrung her hands . " Is ' e dead ? " <p> Phaedra could see an ominous pool of blood oozing from beneath the man 's shoulder . <p> Zod Armstrong knelt beside her . " Good God , " she said again . " Poor devil . " <p> " Yes , he 's quite dead , I fear , " Phaedra answered , withdrawing her hand . <p> " Who do you think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head with one finger to better show his face . <p> Phaedra swallowed hard . " I ... I 'm not sure . " <p> " Should we roll him over ? " asked Zod . " Go through his pockets ? That 's what they do in novels , you know . " <p> " What on earth is going on ? " Phaedra whispered , almost to herself . On impulse , she reached for Zod 's hand . " Miss Armstrong , I think we should call Mr. Kemble again . We shall need a doctor  --  or a constable , perhaps . " <p> But Mr. Kemble was already clattering back down the stairs . " Good heavens , Miss Armstrong , what have you done n  --  " Then , upon seeing the prostrate body , he said , " My God ! What 's happened ? " <p> " George , he just staggered in ! " Miss Armstrong rose . " I had nothing to do with it , I swear . " <p> " I can not feel a heartbeat . " Phaedra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat . " Have you a doctor close at hand , Mr. Kemble ? " <p> " Yes , yes , just round the corner . " Kemble was peering down at the body . <p> " Who is it , George ? " asked Miss Armstrong stridently . <p> Slowly , Kemble shook his head as he studied the man 's profile , stark white against the dark , polished floorboards . " No one I know , " he said almost disbelievingly , "  --  and I know everyone . " <p> " Everyone who 's apt to turn up murdered , you mean , " Miss Armstrong added . <p> Kemble seemed not to have heard her . " My dear ladies , I do beg your pardon , " he said . " You must go upstairs at once . " Then , springing into motion , he snatched a Holland cloth off a tarnished suit of armor and tossed it neatly over the dead man . <p> The next half hour passed in something of a daze . Miss Armstrong 's maid , who looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a run to the Bow Street police station . Despite their protestations , Mr. Kemble whisked Phaedra and Miss Armstrong to his flat upstairs where he seated them in an elegantly furnished parlor , and busied Agnes with the making of tea . <p> Miss Armstrong glumly watched him go . " This is nonsense , " she said , tossing her green cloak disdainfully over a leather armchair . " Tea , indeed ! As if we were swooning , faint-hearted females . " <p> " It is rather silly , " Phaedra replied , chewing at her thumbnail , her mind racing . <p> " Now we 're missing all the excitement . " Miss Armstrong flung herself into a chair and crossed her arms over her chest . " I mean , I 'm terribly sorry the poor man is dead , to be sure . But there will be constables now , perhaps even a magistrate . Perhaps we shall have to go and give a statement ? He was a gentleman , do n't you think , Lady Phaedra ? Or something very near it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Phaedra 's voice trembled a little . " An upper servant , I daresay . " <p> " Or  --  or a bank clerk ! " said Miss Armstrong . " Or perhaps just one of George 's disreputable friends . Perhaps he lied to us . " <p> Phaedra lifted her gaze to meet Miss Armstrong 's . " Does Mr. Kemble know a great many such people , Miss Armstrong ? " <p> " You must call me Zod , " she said swiftly . " Especially after this . Oh , yes , lots of George 's friends are rotters . " <p> Phaedra managed a shy smile . " Have you known him long ? " <p> " Oh , all my life ! " she said , waving her hand airily . " When I was little , George was Papa 's valet . " <p> " Was he ? " said Phaedra , surprised . <p> " Well , it was mostly an act of mercy on George 's part , " said Zod . " To be frank , Lady Phaedra , Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Phaedra , " she suggested . " Or just Phae , if you prefer . " <p> Zod 's eyes brightened . " Do you think , Phae , that there shall be something in the Times tomorrow about this ? " she asked , clutching her chair arms . " Wo n't that be exciting ? " <p> " I fear your family will not find it so , " Phaedra warned . " My mother shall be mortified . Certainly she will not wish me to speak with a policeman . She would think it much too far beneath us . " <p> A grin tugged at Zod 's mouth . " Yes , just think of the scandal ! " <p> Just then , a commotion rose up from below . Zod leapt up , and strode from the parlor in a swish of muslin . Curious , Phaedra followed . <p> A man stood at the foot of the stairs  --  a short , red-faced man wearing a bright green waistcoat fit so snugly across his ample belly it looked as if the buttons might explode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was blocking the steps as they snarled at each other . <p> The red-faced man pounded a beefy fist on the balustrade . " Aye , an ' I ' ave a right ter speak wiv any witness ter a murder , " he was shouting . " Stand aside now , Kem , and let me do me job ! " <p> " They did not witness a murder , you dolt . " Kemble stuck out a well-shod foot , nearly tripping the man . " The knife was already in his back . " <p> " Even worse ! " roared the man , his color deepening . " Now I do n't give a cock 's tail feather wot manner o ' fine ladies these are , I 'm ter speak wiv ' em , and speak wiv ' em now ! " <p> " Not in my shop , Sisk , " Mr. Kemble retorted . " I shall give you their names as the law requires . Then you may call upon their families and ask permission . " <p> " Aye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police sergeant growled . " I 'll be sent round back an ' left ter cool me ' eels till kingdom come . " <p> " So you would have me permit what their families will not ? " Kemble demanded . " You 'll rot in hell first , Sergeant Sisk . " <p> Her mouth set in a peevish line , Zod Armstrong started down the steps . " George , do n't be ridiculous . We are perfectly happy to  --  " <p> " You , Miss Armstrong , will not put one more foot down those stairs , " Kemble interjected . He half turned on the staircase , his face suddenly unrecognizable in its wrath . " Get back in that drawing room , miss , or by God I shall come up there and put you in it  --  and your father will thank me for it , too .
