Rage . No other word described it . Rayford knew he had much to be thankful for . Neither Irene -- his wife of twenty-one years -- nor Amanda -- his wife of fewer than three months -- had to suffer this world any longer . Raymie was in heaven too . Chloe and baby Kenny were healthy . That should be enough . Yet the clich consumed came to life for Rayford . He stormed out of the safe house in the middle of a crisp May Monday morning , eschewing a jacket and glad of it . It was n't anyone in the safe house who had set him off . Hattie had been her typical self , whining about her immobility while building her strength . " You do n't think I 'll do it , " she had told him as she raced through another set of sit-ups . " You way underestimate me . " " I do n't doubt you 're crazy enough to try . " " But you would n't fly me over there for any price . " " Not on your life . " Rayford stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dusty field from what was left of the safe house and the piles of what had once been neighboring homes . He stopped and scanned the horizon . Anger was one thing . Stupidity another . There was no sense giving away their position just for a moment of fresh air . He saw nothing and no one , but still he stayed closer to the trees than to the plain . What a difference a year and a half made ! This whole area , for miles , had once been sprawling suburbia . Now it was earthquake rubble , abandoned to the fugitive and the destitute . One Rayford had been for months . The other he was fast becoming . The murderous fury threatened to devour him . His rational , scientific mind fought his passion . He knew others -- yes , including Hattie -- who had as much or more motive . Yet Rayford pleaded with God to appoint him . He wanted to be the one to do the deed . He believed it his destiny . Rayford shook his head and leaned against a tree , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of newly mown grass , the sounds of kids playing in the yard ? Nothing was as it once was . He closed his eyes and ran over the plan one more time . Steal into the Middle East in disguise . Put himself in the right place at the precise time . Be God 's weapon , the instrument of death . Murder Nicolae Carpathia . David Hassid assigned himself to accompany the Global Community helicopter that would take delivery of a gross of computers for the potentate 's palace . Half the GC personnel in his department were to spend the next several weeks ferreting out the location of Tsion Ben-Judah 's daily cyberspace teaching and Buck Williams 's weekly Internet magazine . The potentate himself wanted to know how quickly the computers could be installed . " Figure half a day to unload , reload , and truck them here from the airport , " David had told him . " Then unload again and assume another couple of days for installation and setup . " Carpathia had begun snapping his fingers as soon as " half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " How can we steal some hours ? " " It would be costly , but you could --  " " Cost is not my priority , Mr. Hassid . Speed . Speed . " " Chopper could snag the whole load and set ' em down outside the freight entrance . " " That , " Carpathia said . " Yes , that . " " I 'd want to personally supervise pickup and delivery . " Carpathia was on to something else , dismissing David with a wave . " Of course , whatever . " David called Mac McCullum on his secure phone . " It worked , " he said . " When do we fly ? " " As late as possible . This has to look like a mistake . " Mac chuckled . " Did you get ' em to deliver to the wrong airstrip ? " " ' Course . Told ' em one , paperworked ' em another . They 'll go by what they heard . I 'll protect myself from Abbott and Costello with the paperwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Always , but neither he nor Nicolae suspects . They love you too , Mac . " " Do n't I know it . We 've got to ride this train as far as it 'll take us . " Rayford did n't dare discuss his feelings with Tsion . The rabbi was busy enough , and Rayford knew what he would say : " God has his plan . Let him carry it out . " But what would be wrong with Rayford 's helping ? He was willing . He could get it done . If it cost him his life , so what ? He 'd reunite with loved ones , and more would join him later . Rayford knew it was crazy . He had never been ruled by his feelings before . Maybe his problem was that he was out of the loop now , away from the action . The fear and tension of flying Carpathia around for months had been worth it for the proximity it afforded him and the advantage to the Tribulation Force . The danger in his present role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the International Commodity Co-op , the one entity that might keep believers alive when their freedom to trade on the open market would vanish . For now , Rayford was just meeting contacts , setting up routes , in essence working for his own daughter . He had to remain anonymous and learn whom to trust . But it was n't the same . He did n't feel as necessary to the cause . But if he could be the one to kill Carpathia ! Who was he kidding ? Carpathia 's assassin would likely be put to death without trial . And if Carpathia was indeed the Antichrist -- and most people except his followers thought he was -- he would n't stay dead anyway . The murder would be all about Rayford , not Carpathia . Nicolae would come out of it more heroic than ever . But the fact that it had to be done anyway , and that he himself might be in place to do it , seemed to give Rayford something to live for . And likely to die for . His grandson , Kenny Bruce , had stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful losses . The late Ken Ritz had been a new friend with the makings of a good one . Bruce Barnes had been Rayford 's first mentor and had taught him so much after supplying him the videotape that had led him to Christ . That was it ! That had to be what had produced such hatred , such rage . Rayford knew Carpathia was merely a pawn of Satan , really part of God 's plan for the ages . But the man had wreaked such havoc , caused such destruction , fostered such mourning , that Rayford could n't help but hate him . Rayford did n't want to grow numb to the disaster , death , and devastation that had become commonplace . He wanted to still feel alive , violated , offended . Things were bad and getting worse , and the chaos multiplied every month . Tsion taught that things were to come to a head at the halfway point of the seven-year tribulation , four months from now . And then would come the Great Tribulation . Rayford longed to survive all seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his thousand-year reign on earth . But what were the odds ? Tsion taught that , at most , only a quarter of the population left at the Rapture would survive to the end , and those who did might wish they had n't . Rayford tried to pray . Did he think God would answer , give him permission , put the plot in his mind ? He knew better . His scheming was just a way to feel alive , and yet it ate at him , gave him a reason for breathing . He had other reasons to live . He loved his daughter and her husband and their baby , and yet he felt responsible that Chloe had missed the Rapture . The only family he had left would face the same world he did . What kind of a future was that ? He did n't want to think about it . All he wanted to think about was what weapons he might have access to and how he could avail himself of them at the right time . Just after dark in New Babylon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pilot wants to know if he 's to put down at the strip or at --  " " I told him already ! Tell him to do what he 's told ! " " Sir , the bill of lading says palace airstrip . But he thought you told him New Babylon Airport . " David paused as if angry . " Do you understand what I said ? " " You said airport , but --  " " Thank you ! What 's his ETA ? " " Thirty minutes to the airport . Forty-five to the strip . Just so I 'm clear --  " David hung up and called Mac . Half an hour later they were sitting in the chopper on the tarmac of the palace airstrip . Of course the computer cargo was not there . David called the airport . " Tell the pilot where we are ! " " Man , " Mac said , " you 've got everybody chasin ' their tails . " " You think I want new computers in front of the world 's best techies , all looking to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency and heard the instruction for the cargo pilot to take off and put down at the palace strip . He looked at David . " To the airport , chopper jockey , " David said . " We 'll pass ' im in the sky . " " I hope we do . " They did . David finally had pity on the pilot , assured him he and Mac would stay put , and instructed him to come back . A crane helped disgorge the load of computers , and Mac maneuvered the helicopter into position to hook up to it . The cargo chief attached the cable , assured Mac he had the size and power to easily transport the load , and instructed him how to lift off . " You 've got an onboard release in case of emergency , sir , " he said , " but you should have no problem . " Mac thanked him and caught David 's glance . " You would n't , " he said , shaking his head . " Of course I would . This lever here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
