Headnote ( NEANDERTHINK ) Headnote THE FEAR OF EXCLUSION AND EXILE RUNS DEEP . BUT TODAY , SAYS NANDO PELUSI , PH.D. , SOCIAL OSTRACISM IS LIKELY TEMPORARY-AND FAR FROM THE END OF YOUR WORLD . YOU 'RE ON A lunch break among peers who are furiously critiquing the administration 's handling of the Iraq war . Unbeknownst to your co-workers , you 're staunchly against " cutting and running . " But rather than declare your position , you bite your tongue . In this moment , your need to fit in is stronger than your need to articulate your views , even though you 're pained by the choice to clam up . We evolved not to be tireless defenders of the " truth " ( however hawkish we perceive it to be ) , but to fit into the prevailing group . That is one reason we experience such piercing discomfort at the prospect of being ostracized . There was a time when ostracism meant grave danger . Today it probably only means a grave hassle . But we unconsciously conflate the two because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cost . The reason this urge is strong is that for most of human history the group was our meal ticket and primary means of survival . Then , as population and mobility increased , our ancestors encountered an ever-expanding circle of family , kin , clan , and band . Today that circle encompasses teeming cities of anonymous people who have formed subgroups such as Democrats , plutocrats , Ivy Leagues , bowling leagues , and , of course , co-workers . Far too often , we erroneously invest these loose social networks with powers better suited to a congress that really does determine survival . Everyone has ancestors , but not everyone leaves descendants . Those who did were almost certainly members of a functioning group or tribe . Charles Darwin himself observed , " A tribe including many members who ... were always ready to aid one another , and to sacrifice themselves for the common good , would be victorious over most other tribes ; and this would be natural selection . " Darwin showed that the survival of the individual was responsible for evolution but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Social anxiety and concern for status are the emotional checks that keep our cooperative , conformist behavior on track . We often tacitly believe , " I must fit in , or the effects will be terrible . " Or , " If I do n't fit in here , I wo n't fit in anywhere . " However , getting fired from your job or cold-shouldered by a group of acquaintances hardly means getting thrown down a volcano . Still , the need to be accepted among peers is so powerful that anxiety kicks in even under wholly nonlife-threatening circumstances , such as showing up solo at a cocktail party or being called on to speak in public . We want to prove our loyalty to a group , but loyalty carries its own hazards : In our zeal to avoid banishment , we might commit too deeply or for too long . Often we are so keen on fitting in that we fail to ask whether we really benefit from an affiliation in the first place . An extrinsically motivated employee maybe so focused on pleasing a demandingboss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , as Scooter Libby might well attest . Those who join cults or other exclusive groups often can not backpedal even when they want to ; instead , they discover the radical asymmetry between the cost of adhering and the benefits of membership . But you do n't have to be a cult leader ( or campus fraternity president ) to capitalize on the human willingness to make sacrifices in order to commit to a group . Groups often make it hard to fit in : Exorbitant membership fees win you 365-day access to elite clubs ; burdensome rituals signal your adherence to a religion ; and trial by fire is the price of admission to many a workplace . Commitment is a difficult thing to fake . Often , one proves allegiance for allegiance 's sake . " SuicideGirls " ( modern hippie chicks who sport piercings and tattoos ) , bikers , and rock musicians all send signals that are believable . No other group would accept this get-up , so you guys are stuck with me , and me with you . Nuns and monks take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance winning out over individual interest , at least from a Darwinian viewpoint . Once we 're safely ensconced in a group , we face a new dilemma : the need to distinguish ourselves . In other words , we want to fit in , but once accepted , we wish to stand out An individual who shines or stands apart often reaps personal benefits , but there 's also a benefitto the group . Dissenters and contrarians make for a stronger organization ( up to a point ) . Cooperation does not mean homogeneity . Groups are stronger with a wide variety of talents serving a similar end . The Beatles did their best work after butting heads . Research scientists who furiously debate the causes of global warming outperform those who refuse to acknowledge conflicting data . Michael Moore and Ann Coulter each believe that they epitomize the patriotic American , and a political system that allows for such shrill extremes is more vibrant than a nation that squelches them , no matter how reviled each is by their respective out-group . Of course , most people could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull of conformity is just too strong . The rewards of group acceptance include the sense that we 're doing well by doing right by others . In contrast , getting frozen out can foster intense pain , unless we properly understand how we needlessly contribute to that pain today . Namely , we 're endorsing a Neanderthink legacy : " I absolutely must be accepted by this group , " a premise that for hundreds of generations promoted group cohesion . Often such cohesion came at the expense of individuation . Today , our options are far more varied than those faced by ancestors who passed on their emotional apparatus to us . Speaking out in favor of the Iraq war or against your co-workers ' accounting skills may earn you dirty looks . But chances are you 've just uttered the rallying cry of another , rival group , one that will welcome you into the fold .

Sidebar HOW TO DeaL WITH THe pain Of EXCLUSION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO DISTORT THE CONSEQUENCES OF REJECTION . * Whether confronted by " mean girls " or Machiavellian co-workers , beware of magnifying the effects of group exclusion . Our knee-jerk inner voice says , " I must belong or the effects will be catastrophic and global . " Usually they are neither . * Telling yourself that your ouster is terrible will only reinforce your anxiety about the situation . Remind yourself that you do n't need this group 's approval to survive , and your anxiety will become appropriate concern . * The need for affiliation with a specific group at all costs blinds you to new opportunities and creates a global sense that you will always be rejected . * Monitor labels : Are you condensing your essence into a party , race , gender , or nationality ? Remember that " groups " today are convenient monikers and ever-shifting alliances , not survival-focused entities like families or tribes . * When a group limits your options , you can leave for another group more easily than ever before .
