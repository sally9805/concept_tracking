<p> WASHINGTON  --  At 2 p.m. on a rainy Wednesday , Nick Johnson cuts a lonely figure inside RFK Stadium . It is 51/2 hours before his Washington Nationals play the Chicago Cubs . <p> As he runs the ramps toward the upper deck , he dodges carts bringing down hot dog rolls and electrical equipment . <p> His work starts early , and the rain has the first baseman and trainer Lee Kuntz improvising . Over the next two hours , Johnson will run , hit balls , jump , stretch and lift weights . Anything except what he desires : play baseball . <p> Late last September , Johnson broke his right leg colliding with teammate Austin Kearns while chasing a foul ball . Johnson was expected to miss the first month of this season . Then it became June to give the bone time to heal . At the least he figured to be in the starting lineup by now . <p> But as the Nationals begin the second half , their .992 career fielder who hit .290 with 23 homers and a .428 on-base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being on the bench gets him closer to the action but adds to the frustration : " I am here every day . I try to have fun watching the games . " <p> He is not always successful and struggles when asked what is positive : " Maybe watching games and watching pitchers . Maybe watching how everyone is different on the mound . Maybe getting myself better mentally . " He shakes his head and laughs ruefully . <p> Many players overcome injuries during the grind of a 162-game season . When recovery takes longer than expected , the isolation seems intolerable . That is Johnson 's lot . <p> " I do n't like sitting on the bench . It 's real tough , " Johnson admits . " I 'll take a walk during the game , go get a Red Bull , come back down . It is a grind . " <p> Johnson likes to hang out with his teammates but knows they have different goals on game day . <p> Instead of a uniform , he wears shorts and tennis shoes when he works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has had a full workout of lifting weights , leaping on and off stools , doing single knee bends , lunges and squats . <p> " Sometimes I hit early with them , but I ca n't really get out there and take ground balls just yet , " Johnson says . " I do n't want to get in the guys ' way . They have to get ready for the game . " <p> So Johnson comes in early , and batting practice pitcher Jose Martinez throws him short toss in the cage . Strength and conditioning coach Kazu Tomooka works him out in the weight room with a combination of lifting and plyometrics , a repetition of explosive standing leaps . <p> Johnson 's teammates do n't feel he is in the way . <p> " It 's great that he can be here ( in the clubhouse ) . He 's a big part of that , too , " catcher Brian Schneider says . " If they stuck him down in Florida to rehab , who knows what effect that might have ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson " is sorely missed , " that numbers do n't fully explain his value to a team with the third-worst record ( 37-54 ) in baseball . <p> " He has a high on-base percentage , a guy who can drive in the big run . He 's a doubles machine and a guy who works the count , forces the other pitcher to throw a lot of pitches and increases the pitch count , getting pitchers out earlier , " Bowden says . " He 's also a good influence on young hitters , and he 's such a great defensive first baseman . " <p> Kearns adds : " He would be missed out of any lineup . We are all anxious to see him back on the field . We are all definitely looking forward to it . " <p> Regaining skills <p> Medically , Johnson has healed . What is keeping him from playing is returning to form . <p> " The problem for Nick is that the fracture healing was late out of the gate , " team physician Ben Shaffer says . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient , to be restoring muscle strength and endurance and then get all his agility skills back , that is not an easy task to do in a very focused period of time . " <p> Shaffer says the team began using a bone stimulator  --  pulsing ultrasound  --  and stopped Johnson from tobacco use , which some studies have shown to inhibit fracture healing . <p> Johnson has stayed positive throughout his time on the sidelines , and the Nationals are thrilled with his attitude . But even the first baseman has doubts . <p> " You never know when it is going to be the last time , " he said of playing . " You hear that a lot . One play like that ... " <p> Those thoughts are fleeting but probably have driven him to prepare even more diligently for a return . <p> Because he has worked so hard the last 12 weeks , Johnson developed tendinitis around the knee and bursitis around the hip . Johnson went to see a specialist for the hip this month . Shaffer said the tendinitis has healed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but " there are no restrictions in his activities . " <p> Johnson is setting no goal for his return , saying " sometime this year . Not next year . Whenever it is , that would be great to come back and play with the fellas . " <p> The Nationals are fortunate to have picked up Dmitri Young , who last played with the Detroit Tigers and was signed to a minor league contract in February . The 12-year veteran hit .339 with 23 doubles and 43 RBI in 81 games in the first half and was Washington 's representative to the All-Star Game . <p> Still , they miss Johnson 's bat , glove and presence in the lineup . Having Young and Johnson would give manager Manny Acta more flexibility . <p> Johnson " is the biggest piece , " says Acta , in his first year with the team . " Regardless of the numbers that Alfonso Soriano ( now with the Chicago Cubs ) put up last year , the MVP of the team was Nick Johnson . He has a great personality and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get him back . " <p> Not yet satisfied <p> When Johnson steps into the batting cage , it is difficult to see the difference in his swing . <p> As Martinez tosses up pitches in different locations , Johnson answers with a series of line drives that sound like rifle shots . <p> " I was able to let it go pretty good , " he says . <p> Satisfied with his time at the plate , Johnson also knows the fraction that is missing . <p> " I have to be able to take a pitch , get fooled and be able to go out on that front side and not wobble , " he says . Regaining the comfort level in the field could take longer . <p> Johnson regularly takes infield work on his own , but his ability to turn on the ball and make a crossover move is not 100% . " I need to be able to react as quickly as I need to in the field , " he says . <p> Until then , the rehabilitation will continue . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , " he says . " That would n't be helping me or the guys . I wo n't do that . I 've got to be able to play and do all the things , hit , do everything around the base , drive the ball and do the little things . " <p> When he 's ready , the Nationals will probably send him to the minor leagues for a rehabilitation assignment . <p> " When I go down there , I want to be able to work on timing of my swing and work on fielding and playing the game , " Johnson says . " Hopefully my leg wo n't be an issue when I go down there . I want to work on baseball things , not rehab . I want to go back out there and play 100% . " <p> Acta , though , says Johnson will find his game coming back in parts . <p> " Hitting should n't be a problem , " Acta says . " Next will come the finishing touches  --  explosive movements at first base and baserunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding , moving side to side and diving for the ball . " <p> Johnson is convinced that once play begins everything will take care of itself . " If it hurts , it 's going to hurt . I 'll just have to deal with it , " he says . " As long as I 'm good enough to go , I do n't care about the rest . I 'll play through it . " <p> Shaffer is confident Johnson will not jeopardize his progress just for a chance to play . <p> " Nick is a smart and experienced ballplayer , " the doctor says . " He certainly will not subject himself to reinjury . He 's a very important part of the team 's future . <p> " We have no concerns about him not sharing ( problems ) with us . He knows it 's a struggle but that he 'll get through it .
