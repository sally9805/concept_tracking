What 's Hollywood doing knocking off Japanese horror films ? Is n't East Asia supposed to make tatty copies of U.S. products ? Maybe handbags and CDs , but Japanese horror is getting the starlet treatment in parts of Los Angeles these days . With reason : its recent , smartly shivery movies are the best . So much so that two young Japanese directors have now gone west to show Hollywood how scary is done . <P> It was in 1998 , a year before The Sixth Sense , that Ringu ( The Ring ) became an Asia-wide smash . Hideo Nakata 's movie had a surefire opening ( a killer videocassette ) and a double climax ( our heroine confronts death down a well , and then her boyfriend is murdered when the dead girl in the video crawls out of a TV set ) . But Nakata , like all good dread auteurs , did more . He created a mood that informed every scene and adhered to the viewer long after the film ended . <P> Ringu spawned a sequel and a prequel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also generated a genre , whose motto might have been " I see dead people , and they want me to join them . " The stories of implacable ghosts developed their own cliches  --  closets full of ghosts and corpses , girls with long hair hiding their malevolent faces , dotty old ladies , child zombies caked in white  --  all of which you can expect to see in the Hollywood remakes . <P> The sharpest post-Ring cycle is Ju-on , two features on video and two on film written and directed by Takashi Shimizu . They detail the mischief that awaits anyone entering a house haunted by the ghosts of a man , his murdered wife and his son Toshio . The Ju-on series is a superbly orchestrated symphony of fear . A girl crawls under bedsheets to escape the wraiths and feels a tug on her leg ; she lifts the covers to see a grimacing ghoul , climbing closer . <P> Hollywood studios often remake foreign films but rarely with the original directors . Yet Nakata is directing The Ring 2 and Shimizu is remaking Ju-on ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Japanese directors to make major studio films in America . Another Nakata film  --  Dark Water , his best  --  is being remade by Walter Salles , with Jennifer Connelly as a mother who gets traumatized and very wet in a haunted apartment building . <P> It 's nice that studio bosses recognize that there are not only scenarios but auteurs worth gambling on . We 'll know soon enough whether Nakata and Shimizu flourish or perish in Tinseltown . But two changes can be expected . The U.S. remakes will streamline the original films ' perplexing ( and beguiling ) ambiguity . And the heroines , who in Japan often accept their fate passively , will be morphed into righteous fighters . <P> But why wait for remakes ? All of Nakata 's and Shimizu 's films are available online or at the more adventurous video stores . Check them out to see how Japan 's new blood can revive Hollywood 's old blood and make your blood run cold .  --  R.C.                 @ @ @ @
