The term " sacred places " summons images of legendary destinations  --  Egypt 's Pyramids , St. Peter 's Basilica in Rome , the al-Haram Mosque in Mecca  --  that have drawn pilgrims throughout history . Such structures are physical expressions of religion , from the Latin religare , meaning to " bind together "  --  institutions primarily meant for communal experience . But there 's a different sort of sanctuary , or temple , that fosters private spiritual contemplation , derived from the Indo-European root tem , meaning " to cut . " These are the settings  --  some natural , some man-made  --  that you seek when you want to cut yourself off from humdrum reality , open yourself to greater possibilities , and remember what really matters . Only 40 percent of Americans attend weekly religious services , but 90 percent say they pray , and 75 percent say that they do so daily  --  statistics that suggest that off-the-grid sacred places are important to millions and millions of inner lives . Sometimes it 's what you do in a place that makes it sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings or a storefront where you do yoga or tai chi . The number of people who read the Bible or other scripture during their commutes shows that even trains and buses can become temporary retreats . Anyone who has a teenager or remembers being one knows that a bedroom can be a sanctuary . As the Beach Boys put it : " There 's a world / Where I can go / And tell my secrets to / In my room / In my room . " Informal shrines . Recently , I 've been amazed by how many everyday places now incorporate little informal shrines . A bedroom corner becomes a meditation center ; one end of a mantelpiece turns into an altar ; a garden grows up around a stone Buddha or Francis of Assisi . The most moving of these homemade sacred places are the roadside memorials that mark accidental deaths . No New Yorker will forget the flowers , candles , and signs that spontaneously sanctified the city 's firehouses after 9/11 . If some ordinary places become holy because of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular kind of beauty , often quite simple , that lifts up your mind and heart . Indoors , the single most effective element of this kind is light . Shaker architecture shows that a sparkling , unadorned window blazing with sunshine can offer a view into another world . In the evening , you can make a sacred place in any dark room just by lighting a candle or a fire in the hearth . Frank Lloyd Wright , who insisted that even ordinary homes should offer hearths and openness to the outdoors , said , " Nature is my manifestation of God . " Many of his fellow Americans agree . Now that most of us live in vast , urbanized metropolitan areas , the sheer novelty of a natural environment helps to cut us off from quotidian reality and put things in a different perspective . Many of us choose to vacation near a mountain range or an ocean , which both evoke what psychologists call the " diminutive effect "  --  the transcendent realization of being a very small fish in a very big pond . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the seashore , or a far-off resort to be inspired by a sunrise or sunset , a canopy of stars , or a full moon . Over years of thinking and writing about how our external worlds affect our inner ones , I 've visited Europe 's cathedrals , India 's temples , and Morocco 's mosques . Nevertheless , when I hear " sacred place , " I think first of my modest home , a one-room schoolhouse in the woods , where I 'm writing these words . Like many American homes , the schoolhouse combines natural and architectural ingredients in its recipe for ordinary sacredness . On this chilly morning , sunlight floods the white , high-ceilinged room . The only sounds come from the brook , the wind rustling in the sere autumn leaves , and the fire crackling in the wood stove . When I woke up , the first thing I saw was a small herd of deer grazing on the lawn . The schoolhouse has precious little plumbing and no central heating , cell service , or high-speed Internet . Given a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconveniences  --  or perhaps because of them  --  this is where I come to be cut off from the status quo , glimpse the big picture , and remember the deep truths that are so easy to forget elsewhere .
