<p> If you play golf on a weekly basis in Houston and do n't belong to a private club , you are entitled to bristle every time you play one of the high-end daily-fee courses in the area . <p> You have to whip out the plastic or dig deep into the cash that was stipulated for Saturday night 's adventures . But you do it because you love to play . <p> Fortunately , there 's some financial relief on the way for people who are happy to see the 100-degree heat depart . The Paradise Golf membership , which proved to be a successful endeavor in 1999 , its first year in Houston , is back for 2000 , with 13 courses at 10 facilities around town participating . <p> Paradise Golf , a subsidiary of Outback Sports and based in Jacksonville , Fla. , offers half-priced green and cart fees at all of the courses . This usually equates to about a $ 25 savings per round during the week and between $ 30 and $ 35 on weekends after 10 a.m. ( the offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> The cost for a six-month membership is $ 169 , meaning that if you play six times , you will break even . Anything beyond that is money saved . <p> The catch is that the Paradise membership is good only from Nov. 1 until the end of February and in July and August , 2001 . <p> For $ 30 , the membership can cover the full 12 months beginning Nov. 1 . But savings in the peak months ( March-June , September and October ) are only 20 percent off green and cart fees . Still , it might be a wise investment . <p> The president of Paradise Golf admits up front that membership in his club is not for everybody . If you are a once-a-month golfer , you probably wo n't realize the benefits designed for more frequent players . <p> " What we 've done is work with some of the best courses in Houston to determine when they need help filling their tee-time sheets , " says Barry Turnbull . " We pay the golf courses a fee for participating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they receive a lot of play from our members . <p> " The clubs share in the benefits . They 're getting play when they might not otherwise get it , and they 're getting a decent rate , too , plus the compensation from us . " <p> Another benefit of the Paradise membership is that you can reserve tee times four days in advance at all the facilities . Those taking part : Eagle Pointe , Cypresswood ( Tradition , Cypress and Creek courses ) , River Ridge , Longwood , Southwyck , Cinco Ranch , Houston Oaks ( Links and Oaks courses ) , Greatwood , Bear Creek 's Masters Course and Cypress Lakes . <p> The Houston market was successful enough in the first year of operation to merit a return , Turnbull said . The program was dropped in Dallas after not being as well-received in the first year . <p> For $ 169 , it 's a good deal - if you play consistently during the off-peak months . For information , call 800-605-2582 . <p> Waterwood purchased - One of the state 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Waterwood National , located about 20 miles east of Huntsville , has been sold to Club Consultants Inc. , which also owns Tapatio Springs near San Antonio . <p> The purchase is significant . First and foremost , CCI has a track record for taking facilities that have fallen into disrepair and restoring them to a quality level . Tapatio now ranks as one of the state 's top golf resorts after nearly a decade off the golf map . <p> CCI has made a similar commitment to get Waterwood back where it belongs . The corporation plans on putting more than $ 7 million into improvements in the course , the adjacent hotel and clubhouse . <p> The best thing CCI has going for it is the Pete Dye-designed course . With several holes curling around Lake Livingston , Waterwood is heavy on the eye candy . And it 's a challenge , still ranking as one of the hardest courses in Texas , as its 142 slope rating attests . <p> South of the border - The Mexican Open , a $ 300,000 tournament in Mexico City Nov. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Meadow Ranch Golf Club in Magnolia . <p> All pros and amateurs with a handicap index of 4.0 or less are eligible .

Unless you are a member or know one , it 's not easy to play probably the best pure golf course in Houston . <p> But players can walk in the same steps Tiger Woods , David Duval and others will be taking next year at this time during the Adventure Quest Invitational Oct. 30 . <p> The tournament is limited to 18 five-man teams , and aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cy Creek Christian Community Center - the tournament was a lot of fun last year in its inaugural run .

The challenging course will host the Golfcrest Four-Ball Invitational , with the intent of building it into a marquee amateur event locally . <p> " We want this to get back to where it was , drawing some of the top amateurs in the area , " says Golfcrest member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're lacking some players this year , but we understand things like this do n't happen overnight .

Each Wednesday , the Chronicle will run the results of the previous week , the running total and the upcoming week 's pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite Canadian after his showing last week . If he 'd won the playoff , he might even give Bud Light a run . Now that we 're on a roll , it 's time for a make-or-break week . We 've saved Jim Furyk all year for this event . He 's won at Las Vegas the past two years and three of the last five . In an interesting reversal , the HGA lost $ 81,000 because they picked Scott Hoch after Stewart Cink withdrew . Problem is , the HGA also picked Hoch at the Buick Classic and , just as the Chronicle forfeited points last week for picking Cink again , each player can only be used once . Is n't that a shame ? <p> Chronicle HGA <p> Last week 's picks Mike Weir Scott Hoch <p> Earnings $ 324,000 $ 0 <p> Year-to-date earnings $ 3,468,174 $ 3,700,350 <p> This week 's pick Jim Furyk Fred Couples <p> NOTES : Eddie Sefko covers golf for the Chronicle .
