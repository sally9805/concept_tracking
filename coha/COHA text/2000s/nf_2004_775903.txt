THE MAN // Most of his employees would describe Casey as an extraordinary man-but just an ordinary CEO . // On a personal level , they genuinely liked their leader . Casey was a devoted husband , a loving father to his four children , a committed parishioner at Sacred Heart Church , and a helpful friend and neighbor . It was almost impossible not to like-even admire-the man . // Which made his limitation as a leader all the more mystifying. // HIS STORY // The McDaniel family had lived modestly in Carmel for the past fifty years , and Casey grew up on or around the many golf courses in the area , usually as a caddy or gardener . His affinity for golf was matched only by his love for computers , so he left home after high school to attend the University of Arizona on a golf scholarship , where he studied electrical engineering and computer science . Four years later he graduated toward the middle of his academic class , but at the top of the Pac-10 Conference in golf . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back home at Pebble Beach in front of friends and family , was too much for Casey to resist . So he joined a qualifying tour where he quickly became one of the more popular players on the circuit with his quiet humor and generosity toward any fellow golfers who needed a little advice about their stroke . // Over the course of the next five years , Casey won a few more than his share of second-tier tournaments and earned enough money to keep his head far above water . But just as he was about to break through to the big tour , he developed a chronic case of what golfers call the yips-an almost clinical disorder that makes it difficult to remain steady while in the act of putting . Plenty of promising players had their careers cut short by the pseudo-psychological yips , and Casey reluctantly counted himself among them . // Never one to let disappointment keep him down for too long , Casey returned home with a new sense of purpose-and an idea . In a matter of months , he got married , bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired two local programmers , and began hacking away at what he believed would be the most realistic golf video game that the market had ever seen . // The initial results would wildly exceed even his expectations . // BREAK // Within two years of launching his company , Yip Software , Casey released his first product , which immediately set the standard for realism in all sports-related games . Because of his in-depth background in the sport , the game reflected deep knowledge of many of the subtle aspects of actual golf venues , including of course , the putting greens . // Almost immediately the game became a favorite of the most important focus group of customers imaginable : golfers themselves . // Because he had become close friends with many players who were now on the tour , Casey was able to arrange inexpensive but effective sponsorship deals with a few of the better young players . But it was a purely accidental occurrence that propelled Yip 's success beyond being a niche video game and onto the pages of Sports Illustrated . // One of Casey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year after the product had been released . During his post-tournament press conference , he was asked about the improvement in his putting . Almost embarrassed , he admitted , " I ca n't believe I 'm going to say this , but I think it may have something to do with a video game I 've been playing lately .... " // And the cat was out of the bag . // ( Continues ... ) //
