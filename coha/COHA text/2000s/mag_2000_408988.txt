Starting a new diet or exercise plan or breaking a bad habit takes a deliberate , thoughtful process of change . And if you 're not ready for it , it wo n't last . Here are the six steps you need to hit and sustain your goals . // // this time it 's really going to be different , you tell yourself .. No way are you going to end the first year of the new millennium overweight and out of shape . You 're really going to make it work this time . All it takes is a little willpower ... Well , that 's not all it takes . According to James Prochaska , Ph.D. , professor of psychology at the University of Rhode Island and co-author of Changing for Good ( Avon Books , 1994 ) , the problem is that most people do n't prepare themselves adequately for the big changes they want to make . As a result , they fail again and again . " We now know that changing behavior requires making a series of changes successfully , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his colleagues first identified six very specific stages of change that people go through in the process of overcoming such high-risk behaviors as alcohol abuse and smoking . This model has since gained widespread acceptance among psychologists and other health professionals , and its use is not limited to addiction . Susan Cantwell , a personal trainer based in Fredericton , New Brunswick , Canada , has found the theory so helpful in her work with clients that she wrote Mind Over Matter . Personal Choices for a Lifetime of Fitness ( Stoddart Publishing , 1999 ) , a book that focuses on the six stages as they apply to diet and exercise . In addition , last year the Journal of the American Medical Association published the first study showing that behavioral and lifestyle counseling alone can be just as effective as a structured high-intensity gym program for getting sedentary people to start and maintain a regular exercise program . The highly effective lifestyle counseling in this particular study was based on Prochaska 's stages-of-change theory , says study co-author Andrea Dunn , Ph.D. , associate director of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas . " Prochaska 's model is very user-friendly , " Dunn says . The experts agree that if you can identify and understand the importance of each stage and how to use specific strategies that are effective in each , you 'll dramatically boost your chances of progressing from stage to stage and achieving your goals . Break it up , spread it out If you 'd like to make both diet and exercise changes , do n't lump them together as one giant goal ; each requires a different course of research , planning and action . " And you 're likely to be at a different stage in each , " Prochaska says . Say you want to kick your daily McDonald 's habit and start an exercise program , but have n't taken any steps yet because first you want to quit smoking . You have three separate changes to make , and you 'll need to prioritize them . You might choose to start on the smoking addiction first , or work on smoking and diet simultaneously . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on a couple of goals at once , " Prochaska says of a study he 's conducting , " but others need to be careful not to overwhelm themselves . " Once you 've broken down your goals in each area , it 's time to figure out exactly what stage you 're in for each . Do n't try to hurry yourself through the stages . " There 's no preset time limit , " Cantwell says . " You want to make the journey the goal . " Remember , too , that to go forward may sometimes require going back . If you find something is n't working at any particular stage , you might need to go back a stage or two and reassess your methods and goals . goal getters Three Shape readers share their goals and challenges with personal trainer and stages-of-change expert Susan Cantwell , who offers advice on how each can progress to the next level . Erin LeMoine , 29 , single , San Francisco // 6 stages // 6 stages // QUIZ // Special-events producer Goal : " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick with it . " Present Stage of Change : Action ( Stage 4 ) , with frequent relapses Challenge : " A few years ago I had a major knee operation and learned I have genetically high cholesterol . It 's tough to work on my health problems because I 'm always doing something work-related . " I was a highly active swimmer , gymnast and dancer before my knee injury . Now I 'm lucky if I get to the gym once a week for 20 minutes on the bicycle and some muscle  --  toning work . " Cantwell 's Advice to Erin : " If your health is important to you , you must make exercise a priority . You need to jump back to the Preparation stage Stage 31 and find a flexible way to schedule exercise into your life . " Start with three days a week and up it to four when you 've consistently done that for a couple of months . You 'll also need to develop some adherence strategies . Every Sunday , look at your day planner and schedule your workouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies for dealing with each of them . Once you 've put more thought into preparing for this lifestyle change , you 'll be less likely to relapse . " Amy Burkholder Tschudin , 29 , married , New York City Graduate student Goal : I do n't want to relapse to my old eating and exercise habits . " Present Stage of Change : eating and exercise both at Maintenance ( Stage 5 ) Challenge : " I trained to be a professional ballet dancer from age 9 to age 18 . When I decided to quit and go to college , my entire eating and exercise structure suddenly vanished . " I overcame those problems , but now I 'm faced with new ones . I 'm constantly flying to be with my husband , who lives in Washington , D.C. ( and always has high  --  fat food in the fridge ) , and I 'm going to a highly competitive graduate school , which means I do n't have time to exercise consistently . " Cantwell 's Advice to Amy . " To avoid relapse , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to exercise more consistently . Keep healthy snacks with you when you 're on the go . Find an exercise activity you and your husband can do together . And talk to him about your goals and how he can help . " Ann Pickard , 31 , single , South Pasadena , Calif . Illustrator Goal : I want to keep up my new , improved way of eating and also to start exercising . " Present Stage of Change : exercise , Contemplation ( Stage 2 ) ; diet , Maintenance ( Stage 5 ) Challenge : " Since I was little I 've had uncontrollable cravings for cakes and pastries . I hinged and purged . I had every eating disorder you can think of , and once I got kind of out of control and exercised after every meal . " Now I 've cut way down on the simple carbohydrates , and I 've never felt better . It took me a while to get used to this way of eating and I lose weight very slowly , but my cravings have stopped and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercising at all . Through the years exercise has been a chore , a tool to get me thin . I want to get to the point where I 'm walking a couple of days a week for the joy of it , not to be burning calories , and I want to be fit enough that I 'm not sore the next day . I want to be healthy and comfortable being seen by people . " Cantwell 's Advice to Ann : " The fact that you use the term " a way of eating " tells me you think of the way you eat as a lifestyle change , not a temporary diet . That 's important for making it to Stage 6 . " Healthy eating habits combined with exercise will give you better overall results . Many people become discouraged when they feel they are working hard and not losing weight in the time they think it should take . Rather than focusing on weight loss , focus on all the other benefits regular exercise brings to your overall health - there are more than 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those benefits , and once you 've advanced to the Preparation stage , assign benefits to each week for the year .
