<p> Does Tancredo know <p> ' Arabs ' from ' Iraqis ' ? <p> Re : " Civilized ' world awaits apology after beheading , ' May 16 Spin Cycled Politics column . <p> Congressman Tom Tancredo wants ' Arabs ' to apologize to the ' civilized ' world for the murder of Nicholas Berg . His spokesman ' clarified , ' saying he meant ' Iraqis . ' I do n't know if Tancredo misspoke or does n't know the difference . <p> Tancredo said the apology should come from ' current leaders , religious leaders or new leaders . ' If he meant Iraqis , then does that mean Paul Bremer , the top U.S. official in Iraq , should apologize as the current leader ? Who are the religious readers ? Since some Iraqis are Christian , should the Pope or Jerry Falwell also apologize ? The most interesting group of these potential apologists is the ' new leaders . ' Do either Tancredo or the Iraqis know who these new leaders are going to be , even though President Bush ca n't ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats have been criticized for statements that ' undermine ' our war effort and endanger the troops . Nothing they have said would be more demoralizing than Tancredo 's implication that we are fighting for freedom for an ' uncivilized ' people . <p> Jack Zeller , Lafayette <p> What 's more egregious : <p> prison abuse or beheading ? <p> My dictionary defines ' egregious ' as ' apart from the herd , remarkably bad , flagrant . ' The latter meaning is obviously what The Post had in mind when it was used it in a question to Tom Tancredo 's spokesman : <p> ' So was Tancredo trying to say that the beheading of an American was more egregious than the prisoner abuses by U.S. soldiers ? ' <p> Your reporter is implying that it is stupid to make more of a beheading than of prisoner abuse , and Tancredo must be the one out of line . That question says a lot more about the mentality of The Post than about Tancredo . I submit that civilized people the world over would view beheading as more egregious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families , too <p> Re : ' Four who saved our past , ' May 16 Joanne Ditmer column . <p> Joanne Ditmer writes eloquently about the necessity of saving historic buildings . ' The recent past does n't get the respect it deserves , ' she says , referring to relatively modern structures that are in danger of demolition . <p> True . But more important than preserving buildings is preserving the stories of our elderly citizens - especially our parents . When they die , their stories - our stories - will die with them . <p> It takes time to preserve our family stories . It takes energy and know-how . But it 's worth every minute . It 's one of the few activities where the process is as valuable as the product . <p> Why ? Because telling those stories is as important to the elderly as having their history is to us . Researchers have shown that structured reminiscence - when done the right way , under the guidance of a knowledgeable professional - can relieve age-related depression , reduce the number of doctor visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobility of arthritis sufferers , and even add years to the person 's life . <p> If we do n't make time to preserve those stories now , before it 's too late , the tales will be lost , and with it our chance to help our parents , inform ourselves and inspire our children . <p> Andrea Gross , Denver <p>  --  Religion vs. the ballot box <p> Where are the churches ? <p> Re : ' Bishop draws line for voters , ' May 14 news story . <p> Jogging throughout Denver , I notice beautiful church buildings converted into nightclubs , businesses , homes or condos . What happened ? Over the decades , what forced millions of dedicated church members to turn away from their once beloved and cherished faith , which resulted in millions of children , grandchildren and great-grandchildren not being exposed to the positive attributes of organized religion ? <p> Could it be that church leadership has been taken over by political partisans , such as Catholic Bishop Michael Sheridan of Colorado Springs , who prioritize politics over the basic messages of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They force faithful members to ignore personal rights , conscience and beliefs that are supported by the Constitution - such as gay and women 's rights . <p> Church leaders like Bishop Sheridan continue driving millions of their faithful away from a once pure and basic way of life - to be free to pursue personal beliefs originating from their hearts , souls , consciousness and the purest teachings of Christ . <p> Dave Potak , Denver <p> No authority at ballot box <p> It is sad to see the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Colorado Springs attempting to invade the voting booths of America . The voting booth is a holy place in this land of the free , in which he , by the grace of God , has no authority , nor eyes nor ears . <p> Women have no need to agree with the authority of any church whose leadership is confined to males who have never experienced the problems women have in a church , and in a secular society , in which they have little or no access to full participation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In Christ there is neither male nor female . <p> Rev. Robert G. Hewitt , <p> Colorado Springs <p> The author is a retired Episcopal priest . <p> Church has obligation <p> I am amazed that people are surprised when a bishop preaches the teachings of the Catholic Church . For Catholics there are three sources of authority : sacred scripture , tradition and the magisterium , or teaching authority of the church . The church has the obligation given by Jesus Christ to guide the faithful to salvation . If people know the divine law as revealed and the teaching of the church and refuse to listen , they indeed risk their eternal salvation . And if we truly believe the Eucharist to be the actual body and blood of Christ , we will not receive it in a state of mortal sin and commit the additional sin of sacrilege . <p> Allen Murphy , Denver <p> Vote in sin ; confess later <p> Bishop Michael Sheridan 's attempt to force voters into making public their private voting choices by denying participation in Communion is a clever way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholics vote for any political candidate who does n't endorse selective church positions , they are supposed to publicly decline the Eucharist until they repent . <p> This selective coercion gives good Catholics an opportunity to teach the church hierarchy a few things about the responsibility of penance . <p> I recommend they follow the Church 's example in the national sexual abuse scandal . Vote according to your own conscience and exercise your right as an American citizen to privacy in how you cast your ballot . Then go to the church , cover up your choices and take Communion , and wait about 50 years to confess your ' sin ' before dropping an extra $ 10 into the offering to amend for that transgression . <p> Kevin Menken , Carbondale , Ill . <p> Christ 's gift to all <p> If Bishop Michael Sheridan wants to withhold the body and blood of Christ from those who sin , then there would be only one person qualified to partake of the sacrament : Jesus Christ . But Jesus did n't come to save Himself . He came to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His body and His blood in return for our salvation . Indeed , Holy Communion is His gift to all of humanity . <p> It was not meant to be used as blackmail for the ' unholy . ' That imperfect human beings would deign to sit in judgment of other human beings is perhaps the greatest sin of all because of the presumption of perfection . God is the only sinless one who can make such judgments . There is nothing more ' intrinsically evil ' than anyone who puts himself above God in overruling His will that everyone be saved . Communion is not humankind 's gift to withhold . <p> Tom Cladis , Denver <p> Church following history <p> The Catholic Church has always placed restrictions on the reception of Holy Communion . Holy Communion , apart from being the body and blood of Christ , is a sign of unity among Catholics . Part of that unity involves acting in accord with Catholic teaching . According to St. Paul 's Letter to the Corinthians , those who receive unworthily bring condemnation on themselves from God . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal sin from receiving Holy Communion . It has never stopped . Bishop Michael Sheridan is just reminding Catholics about their obligations as Catholics . <p> There also seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding about the church 's position on the death penalty , which is always brought up as some kind of proof that Bishop Sheridan and other morally courageous bishops are simply Republican hacks . Opposition to the death penalty by the church is not doctrine . It has never been doctrine . In fact , church doctrine states that nations have the right to use the death penalty . Pope John Paul II has said that he does n't see a reason to continue using the death penalty in today 's world , but he has not made a definitive statement requiring that all Catholics oppose the death penalty . Therefore , trying to accuse the bishops of hypocrisy because they rank killing the innocent unborn ahead of a nation 's right to execute convicted criminals is a straw man that does n't honestly deal with the issues at hand . <p> Ian Rutherford , Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic who majored in theology in college , it is my understanding that an individual is not supposed to take Communion if he is in the state of mortal sin . Further , we were taught not to judge others , that if someone appeared to be engaging in what appears to be immoral behavior , it does n't necessarily mean he is committing a mortal sin . The alleged offense is classified as ' grave matter , ' but only the individual and our Supreme Being know whether the behavior is sinful . It is a matter of conscience , and only the individual and God know if it warrants punitive consequences . It is not in anyone 's purview - cardinal , bishop , priest , whomever - to become a judge and decide who can receive Communion . This is a matter strictly between you and God . You can not be refused Communion simply because you choose to vote differently than those in the church hierarchy who confuse their political ideology with theology . <p> Joe Rook , Denver <p> Practical , doctrinal issues <p> Note to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs your moral leadership now more than ever . Do n't blow it by dabbling in secular politics . <p> By issuing voting ultimatums to parishioners , this well-intentioned bishop is starting a dangerous chain of logic that can only lead to either a church- controlled government or mass alienation of Catholics and declining societal influence by the church . Is it not better that the church provide leadership on moral issues and allow morally minded Catholics to exercise judgment in selecting the best person to serve in a secular government ? <p> As a conservative Protestant , I support the moral positions behind Bishop Sheridan 's directive to voters . And I admire his courage and applaud his bold moral leadership . But his method is flawed from both a practical and doctrinal standpoint and will surely fail . <p> Practically , how can a person be assured that a candidate will support all the positions one holds dear ? Our politicians are our employees and servants , not our spiritual leaders . Jesus was the only perfect person , so our votes will always be between sinners . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is responsible for the actions ( sins ) of another . By singling out certain egregious sins , is the church by default allowing others ? What candidate is without sin ? What about adulterers , gluttons , alcoholics , liars , swindlers and wife-beaters ? What about capital punishment advocates , war-mongers , or pacifists who enable genocide by their inaction ? And can a Catholic vote for a Protestant ? Where does this end ? <p> Phil Sykora , Littleton <p> Overusing our resources <p> The front page of the May 16 Denver Post business section was unusual . The four major articles dealt with problems we have sustaining our current lifestyle in Colorado : <p> Our natural gas industry is threatened by the lack of the special Great Lakes regional sand which is critical to the extraction of more natural gas . <p> The sport of golf is threatened by water availability for even more golf courses . <p> The seasonal tourist and landscaping industries have become dependent upon large numbers of seasonal foreign laborers to staff businesses , resorts and other seasonal tourist facilities . <p> Lastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garment industry is critical to the apparel industry . <p> How about curtailing our unsustainable lifestyle a bit to decrease our overuse of natural resources and exploiting cheap labor ? <p> Our grandchildren might have a little left for themselves . <p> Dan Parker , Centennial <p> Accountability for roads and bridges <p> Re : ' Girder warning botched , ' May 18 news story . <p> It is upsetting to hear that a 911 operator was unable to provide an emergency response that would have saved the Post family . However , a 911 operator is trained in emergency response , not road and bridge construction . The road and bridge experts that taxpayers employ should be held accountable for the road construction they plan and execute . Just as schools are held accountable for public education , the agencies in charge of massive , expensive road construction projects should be held accountable for public transportation and safety . <p> Upon inspection , a retired bridge builder said on Fox 31 News soon after the accident that the girder was n't set correctly in the first place . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which appears to show that the girder was n't secure , two days after it was placed above I-70 . A man with bridge-construction experience noticed something wrong with the girder and called 911 an hour before it fell . And , lastly , maintenance crews came out to look for a downed sign just moments before the girder came down and did n't notice the bowing girder . <p> Road construction and road maintenance workers must be held to a higher standard . Working on the roads has to be done with the highest safety standards enforced . <p> Cheryl M. Condon , Conifer <p> Sensor could have triggered warning <p> As an engineer , this tragedy really hurts me . The failure of the beam across C-470 may not have been avoidable ; however , its catastrophic failure and the horrific consequences were . An electronic sensor such as a level or tensiometer could have been attached to the beam . This device would have triggered upon failure of the beam ( i.e. , its shifting out of alignment ) and sent an unambiguous warning message via a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proven technology that is routinely used in far more isolated locations than the intersection of Interstate 70 and C-470 . I recommend that the Colorado Department of Transportation and/or the bridge contractors immediately adopt this technique or a similiar one . This may have been a one-in-a-million situation , but the laws of probability do not preclude if from happening again tommorrow . <p> Mike Stewart , Evergreen <p> Do n't lay blame on dispatcher or caller <p> I was disappointed to read the headline of your story . Why not just hang the dispatcher now ? <p> It 's clear it was n't just she who ' botched ' the opportunity to prevent this tragedy . Both she and the caller missed the opportunity to clarify what he meant by ' girder . ' <p> Personally , I do n't think either can be faulted . They did their best to try to sort out something neither had any direct involvement in . Have we now stooped so low as to throwing blame at people who try to help ? <p> And do n't you think this woman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this headline , which essentially lays all the blame on her ? <p> Shame on you for this opportunistic headline writing . If anything was ' botched , ' it was your decision to poorly handle this otherwise newsworthy story . <p> T. McAndrew , Arvada <p>  --  Can RTD fund another light-rail line without raising taxes ? <p> Re : ' Skeptic assails rail plan , ' May 16 Fred Brown column . <p> Fred Brown 's column on FasTracks ignored several important facts . Brown presented Jack McCroskey 's incredible claims , including that building more light-rail lines can be done within the Regional Transportation District 's current revenues . While it would be wonderful to be able to believe in such a fantasy , the reality is that RTD does not have the financial capacity to build and open another light-rail corridor for the next 20 years , which would be eight years after all of the FasTracks corridors were up and running . To wait two decades for the next corridor to open , and face the impossible battle among cities over which would be next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that we will add another million residents over the next 20 years . <p> The comprehensive FasTracks program will build 119 miles of new rapid transit in six corridors and make improvements to three existing light- <p> rail lines , contribute to 18 miles of bus rapid transit improvements , increase bus service by 36 percent , and double the number of park-n-Ride spaces . Funding for this will come from a sales tax increase amounting to four pennies on every $ 10 purchase , requiring voter approval this November . <p> RTD already operates a very cost-effective and efficient organization , and over the past three years we have made numerous substantial budget reductions . We have frozen salaries and wages , cut staff , eliminated more than $ 30 million from our capital budgets and cut non-productive bus service . We simply do not have the excess capacity to fund another light-rail line . <p> McCroskey 's claims show how easy it is to assail carefully laid plans when one 's assertions are not subjected to exhaustive and close scrutiny like our FasTracks plan has been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax revenues is fun to talk about , but it 's not real . <p> Mary K. Blue , Director , RTD District I <p> Legislature 's inaction on state 's budget woes <p> Re : ' Legislature : Grade thyself , ' May 16 Perspective articles . <p> An old maxim states : ' Take care of today and tomorrow will take care of itself . ' <p> In the case of the Colorado legislature , taking care of today clearly means getting off of a collision course between TABOR 's ratchet effect and Amendment 23 , which will lead to further budget shortfalls in higher education and Medicaid . <p> After reading Sunday 's assessments by leaders of the two parties in the legislature , the Republicans ' philosophy is very clear . Republican spokesman Sen. John Andrews espouses defending the Grover Norquist-inspired TABOR status quo ( shrink government until you can drown it in the bathtub ) and be grateful that Colorado 's citizens are so busy with survival that they are not paying much attention . <p> Thankfully , Democrats are seeking to place Colorado on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a potential special session will remove the ratchet effect of TABOR and excesses in Amendment 23 , and will prevent a $ 250 million budget shortfall next year that would mainly affect higher education . <p> Warning to Andrews and the Republicans : <p> Colorado 's citizens will wake up to the inaction of their representatives when tuition at state universities becomes unaffordable and Grandma gets booted out of the nursing home . <p> By then , however , it will be too late . <p> Gerald Bennett , Boulder <p> The John Andrews Dam <p> Re : ' The key question is , did we safeguard your interests ? ' May 16 John Andrews Perspective article . <p> State Sen. John Andrews makes a virtue out of abject failure . He cites with admiration the Hippocratic oath : ' First do no harm .

He does mention a number of issues that failed to move under his powerful leadership , but assures us that it 's all the fault of ' them ' - you know who he means , the teachers , their union and others of their ilk . <p> When Andrews leaves the scene , perhaps the legislature will move from inaction to tending the public 's business . One of their first acts could be naming a dam after John Andrews as symbolic acknowledgment of his mastery in blocking everything that flowed his way . <p> Harry Puncec , Lakewood @p#
