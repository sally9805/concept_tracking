Chapter One The doctors said my cancer was going to kill me , and on August 13 , 1995 , they turned out to be right . I had termites . I heard that 's what the Babe called them when he was dying . They got me , too . Fucking termites ate away my insides , and there was n't a damn thing anyone could do about it . In my final days I did n't even have the strength to get out of my hospital bed and take a piss . What really got my goat , I had stopped drinking right after my son Billy died , two years before . The doctors had said my drinking was killing me , so I went to the Betty Ford Clinic and quit cold turkey . I guess I did n't stop soon enough . The cancer hit my liver and spread through my body and ate me up until I looked like a skeleton . I should n't kick , though . I certainly had my share of good times . Hey , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs ? Ya give up ? One 's a Goodyear . The other 's a great year . Hey , that 's a joke . Get it ? I got some real doozies . As I was saying , throughout most of my life , I was a hero to many people . I was as big as Elvis , but what no one ever understood was it never meant squat to me . I never could figure out this hero business . Why people worshipped me never made any sense . Twenty-five years after I put my bat down for the last time , I made more money in a year than I ever made as a ballplayer ! Nearly half my life of not doing jack shit , and people were still paying me forty bucks a pop to sign my name to a picture , and I was signing thousands of them ! Did you know one of my first baseball cards sold a few years ago for $275,000 ? That was from 1952 , and two hundred seventy-five grand is a hell of a lot more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so rare ? Back then kids would mail hundreds of them to me at the stadium to sign . I threw them all out . Fuck ' em , I could n't be bothered . I never could understand why anyone wanted to save a piece of gum-smelling cheap cardboard with my picture on it . It seems ridiculous , when you think about it . For years those cards had no value whatsoever , but millions of people hung on to them anyway . The ones that exist today are owned by people smart enough not to send them to me as kids . And if card collecting is dopey , autograph collecting is dopier . It 's just somebody 's name on a piece of paper . What good is it , unless it goes with a phone number and you get it from a really great-looking gal , and she calls you , comes over , and fucks your brains out ? Still and all , I have to admit I am grateful to all the old Yankee fans who would line up and pay me for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been on welfare or in the gutter somewhere . If I was frugal , which I was n't , I suppose I could have made do on my baseball pension . But after I retired the fans continued to pay big bucks for my fun , and so I tolerated them a lot more than I did when I played . When I was a player the fans were as big a pain in the butt as the pain-in-the-ass newspaper reporters . It 's one of my two big regrets , my not being nicer to the fans . They always were wanting something from me , but I never felt I was deserving , and often I 'd punish them for that . I wanted to make them see that they should n't be hero-worshipping anyone , especially someone so unworthy as me , that the guy they worshipped was just a regular lunch-pail guy dressed up in a uniform to look like a hero . We had fountain pens back then , and sometimes I 'd deliberately squirt ink on their clothes , or I 'd try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want to be bothered , which was most of the time , I 'd tell a guy to " fuck off " and then I 'd watch as he 'd slink away , and I 'd wonder who was the bigger asshole , him for asking or me for ruining his afternoon . Looking back , I 'm really sorry I acted that way . I wish I could have been nicer . To all of you out there who met me on a day when I was not fit for the company of strangers , please , please forgive me . I was n't myself . My best self . If I played today and pulled some of that , I 'd get sued , suspended , and probably released . Fans would look at me like I was a real head case . I suppose I was . Maybe that 's why it 's taken me nearly twelve years since I died to make it up here , to , well , the really big leagues . Took me that long to figure that out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fully understand how important I had been to so many people . It was weird . No sooner had I quit , but it seemed like every week or so someone would mail me a fat scrapbook with clippings about my career . I had a pile of them . I spent hours sitting on the can reading the articles . I have to say I was astonished that people had spent so much energy and time accumulating that stuff . They collected newspaper and magazine articles and photos about my life , when I figured they would have gotten a hell of a lot more pleasure collecting stuff about their own lives . That 's because I never saw myself as a hero , even when I was playing in the World Series or winning MVP awards . To me , a hero is someone who does something dangerous like the astronauts or someone who makes peace in the world , like Albert Einstein or George H. W. Bush . ( I was a friend of Bush 's son , George W. , the former Texas governor , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out and get wasted together . The man can hold his liquor , let me tell you . The Rangers never won shit when he was the team president , but he was a lot of fun to be with . I was surprised he did n't end up commissioner of baseball . Or in rehab . ) A drunk gets on an elevator . He goes up one flight and a beautiful blonde gets on . He says , " Can I smell your pussy ? " She says , " Why no , what do you think I am ? " He says , " Then it must be your feet . " I was just a guy who played baseball , and most of the time I did n't even play it all that well . Hard to imagine , but they paid me big bucks to play a game I 'd have played for free . When I hit a home run or made a catch , I was n't being heroic . I was just doing what I was getting paid to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . You ca n't be a hero if you 're doing that . No one could have known it , but being Mickey Mantle was a curse for a long , long time . If I 'd known back when I was a kid what I know now , I like to think I would have told my dad to stick his ball bat where the sun do n't shine and leave me the fuck alone , to pick the neighbor 's kid and rest his hopes and dreams on him . Not that dad would have listened to me . Dads never listen to their kids . They have their own agendas . My dad had a very strong will . He had been a ballplayer as a kid , but when the Depression hit , he had to go to work . When I was born , he decided I was going to fulfill his dreams , and all he ever cared about was my becoming a professional ballplayer . That 's why he made me practice every afternoon after he came home from the zinc mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickey Cochrane . A catcher for Detroit . My name actually is Mickey ; it 's not a nickname for Michael . I often wondered why my dad named me after that guy . Good thing dad did n't like Mel Ott . I 'd have been Melvin Mantle . Would they have called me " The Mel " ? If he had liked Goose Goslin or Heinie Manush , maybe I 'd a ended up being called The Goose , or worse , The Heinie . Say , what do you get when you cross a Cabbage Patch doll with the Pillsbury Doughboy ? Give up ? An ugly little bitch with a yeast infection . I can talk more about my childhood , but I have this burning desire to do it in a book , a real book . When I was alive and kicking , I wrote a string of books . Publishers liked me to write them because they knew when I 'd go to a bookstore to sign them , people would flock like sheep . Since I usually charged more for my autograph than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectors got a bargain , and the publisher got a sale . I suppose a few buyers even read them . Whether they did or not , I ended up making the bestseller list almost every time . Kinda makes a mockery of the book business , do n't it ? All those great philosophical college-smart writers busting their humps to write about life and death and pain and suffering , and they sell two thousand copies , and all I have to do is talk into a tape recorder for a few hours about my career , sign my name at Barnes &; Noble , and bingo , a New York Times bestseller . Nothing to it . You would have to say I had led a charmed life . My first autobiography was called The Making of a Ballplayer . Later I did a book all about my playing in the World Series . I did another one about the 1956 season , called My Favorite Season . I was going to do one about the 1961 series and call it The Infection in My Ass that Kept Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good idea . The thing is , I had too much pride to just let some hack sportswriter take a bunch of clippings and make a book out of my life , like some players do . Any time I wrote a new book , I felt I should write something different , so with each book I was forced to confess something new about my life . Charging for autographs aside , I always believed in earning my money , so you ca n't keep writing the same shit every time . Not long before I died and ended up here , I went on HBO and admitted to Bob Costas that I had a drinking problem . I told them how I had gone to Betty Ford to dry out . Now , I guess , it 's time to write all about it . I swore in the AA meetings I would look at myself honestly , so I have to tell the whole story . I know there will be people who will ask , Mickey , does the public really want to know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so how could it hurt ? God looks a hell of a lot like Casey Stengel , by the way . Only not as old . Lies and coverups and misinformation is for those who passed and went to the other place where the sportswriters , politicians , and umpires end up . Although not really , it turns out . But I need to find the right guy to write this book with me . Once I find him , I can get started , and not only will I be able to recount some of the best moments of my life , but most important , I might be able to explain myself-to myself-to figure out why I turned out the way I did-to figure out why I loved to get rip-roaring drunk and screw the first willing ole gal who walked into the bar . And I know there will be a wide audience of guys who will read my stories and nod their heads knowingly , because they do it , too , only they do n't do it as much , or as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hell of a lot of them because I would meet them almost every night . I also met them in Manhattan , Chicago , Kansas City , and Detroit . In Boston they were the whole city . Of course , a lot of people wo n't want to read a book like this , people who are deeply religious or who do n't like to look at naked gals , or women 's libbers who think the word pussy is obscene unless you 're talking about their cat . And women who suspect their husbands are cheating will not want to read this book . But I 'm betting there are enough closet Peeping Toms who want to hear in detail about the great puss I had or read about blow jobs and orgies . I wo n't write about this stuff because sex sells-there 's no money in heaven-but rather I have to write it because this stuff was real . These are n't made-up stories . They happened . It was what my life was all about , and if I 'm going to make any sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turned out to be the puss hound I ended up being . And maybe then my long-suffering wife Merlyn will understand . And maybe I will , too-but to do this I need to find the right sportswriter to work with me on it . Turns out , not all the sportswriters end up in hell . Up here I found a wide variety of guys to choose from : Grantland Rice , Frank Graham , Arthur Daley , Red Smith , and Dick Schaap . Rice was before my time , Frank and Arthur loved me , never gave me any trouble . I never saw Red much . He wrote a column . Dick did TV , though he did write a lot of as-told-to books . He was one of the few sportswriters who I actually liked . Dick was smart , but he was one of those mythmakers . All athletes were his heroes . He once wrote a book about George Steinbrenner , and he never wrote one unkind thing about him . That 's damn hard to do , and that 's not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeptical guy who will ask the hard questions and force me to tell my story right . I thought to myself , Who did you know who was n't afraid to offend people ? Then it hit me . The sports book that created the biggest stink when it came out was Ball Four , which was written by my big-mouth Yankee teammate Jim Bouton and published just after I retired . Boy , was I pissed when that hit the stands . Funny thing about Bouton : for a couple of years in the sixties he was a real fine pitcher . People forget that . He won eighteen games in 1963 and twenty-one games in 1964 . I even gave him the nickname " Bulldog " ' cause he pitched so tough . He 'd throw a pitch , his hat would come off , and he 'd grunt . He was a competitor , I 'll give him that . Then he hurt his arm from jerking off so much . Ha ! Bouton was a different kind of duck . He did n't drink much , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with reporters , guys most of us either did n't trust or hated , so none of his teammates trusted him very much . And we turned out to be right about that . Anyone who liked those scumbags were suspect because few of the writers had any character . All they cared about was beating each other out for stories . They snuck around and wrote shit about you , whether it was their business or not , and what really made us mad , they had the right to give their opinions , whether they knew what they were talking about or not . Some of them were in bed with the owners , and so if a player got in a salary dispute , he would find himself getting reamed out in the papers . Looking back , we were lucky the reporters , as bad as they were , were nothing like reporters today . If players today did some of the stuff we did , the stories would be all over ESPN in a New York minute . It 's hard to imagine the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporters from our day were bad enough . Fuckers ruined my buddy Roger Maris 's career in New York . But Bouton liked them anyway , and I guess he was sneaking around like they did , ' cause all those years he kept a diary , and after he left the Yankees , he ended up on the Seattle Pilots , where he pitched for the worst team in baseball . The team was so bad it left Seattle after one year . Bud Selig bought it and moved it to Milwaukee . Guess Bouton figured his career was about over , so he 'd make some money writing a book . During that 1969 season he wrote what became Ball Four , in which he wrote that I liked to drink and that a bunch of us-including him-would go on the roof of the Shoreham Hotel in Washington , D.C. , with a telescope to peep through high-rise windows at naked stewardesses , which was true , but that did n't mean he should have written about it . This was the sixties , for crying out loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really pissed me off , because those things were n't the things I wanted anyone to know . Hell , I had a wife and kids . What was he thinking ? The worst part about it was after he wrote that , the next time I went back to the Shoreham , the stews , who were no dummies , kept their blinds drawn . But then after Ball Four came out , a funny thing happened . Almost immediately , it seemed like I had become an even greater hero because I had done those things . People loved me more , they said , because Ball Four made me more human . And once Bouton told the whole world that I drank , it gave me the courage to talk and write about it a little myself . I even wrote a little bit about some of the shit Billy Martin and I pulled . Not much , but just enough to give people an idea of how much fun Billy and I had together . People do n't remember anymore , but Bouton did n't write that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think about it , the more I want that SOB to work on this book with me . His name was Leonard Shecter . He wrote for the New York Post . A rag , but it had a kick-ass sports section in those days . Shecter had a way of making a dull story exciting , I 'll give him that . But he was an aggressive guy , and he scared me , so I avoided him whenever I could . I guess it bothered me that Bouton liked him when I was so afraid of him . But it goes without saying , without Lenny Shecter , there would n't have been a Ball Four . (
