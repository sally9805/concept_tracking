One great blooming , buzzing confusion . " That 's how William James , writing more than a century ago , described the inner world of infants . Babies , unaware of the objects and people outside their bodies , see a kaleidoscope of shimmering pixels , he supposed . The famous Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget agreed : not until they are two years old do children fully appreciate that the world contains things that behave in predictable ways . <P> Nowadays every psychology student is taught that James and Piaget were wrong . From their earliest months , in fact , children interpret the world as a real and predictable place . It 's the parents of an infant who experience the world as a blooming , buzzing confusion , says one psychologist . This new understanding is largely the legacy of Harvard psychologist Elizabeth Spelke . <P> How do you even begin to plumb the mind of a baby ? Infants are harder to study than the usual subjects of psychological research  --  rats and college sophomores . Infants ca n't talk , they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures by crying or worse . <P> Spelke perfected a technique that capitalizes on one thing babies are good at : getting bored . Show a baby some objects , partly blocked by a screen , doing the same thing over and over , and most will tire and look away . Now show them what they had been missing . Some objects roll or fall , just as any grownup would expect . But others , thanks to trapdoors or hidden compartments , defy the laws of physics . They pass through barriers , or disappear and reappear . Are the babies surprised ? Do they look longer at the impossible events , as if trying to figure out what just happened ? <P> Remarkably , they do . Babies as young as three months old , an age at which their visual brains have just been wired up , can be surprised by magical events . They must expect the world to be nonmagical . They expect it to be a place where objects obey laws . <P> Spelke 's ingenuity lies not just in showing that babies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think and learn . Babies are born with no knowledge of how the world works ; they have to learn . But how ? Parakeets learn speech , and VCRs " learn " sights and sounds . Human learning must be more sophisticated . <P> Philosophers like Leibniz and Kant hypothesized that the mind innately thinks in such categories as space , time , number , causation and human intentions . Spelke turned this philosophy into experimental science and showed that infants have an abstract understanding of these categories of reality . They know that objects continue to exist even when you do n't look at them and that they ca n't pass through barriers . Other psychologists  --  some of them her students  --  have documented when in the first year of life the other basic categories come online . With these scaffolds in place , babies can understand the world as they are exposed to it . <P> Spelke is now working with animal psychologists to investigate the minds of other nonverbal creatures , like monkeys . When parents inevitably ask for advice , Spelke tells them to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains will take care of themselves .
