It 's ba-a-a-ck ! The business cycle , that economic beast from 20,000 fathoms , is poking up its head again . The rushing tides of the new economy kept it submerged for almost a decade , but they could not drown it for good . It lives ! Only it now looks like a pretty tame beast . A little slower growth in U.S. production , a little more inflation before the slowdown takes effect , a bit more unemployment , eventually , maybe ... that 's about the worst damage that the cycle is expected to inflict . Unless ... <P> Such was the consensus of TIME 's Board of Economists , which gathered in late May in Manhattan to assess a rapidly changing business outlook . For the first time in at least two years , members concurred , not all economic systems are go . Imbalances are showing up , notably a worsening labor shortage and excessive consumer spending ; signs of renewed inflation are real ; stock markets have turned turbulent , to say the least . Allen Sinai , chief global economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the new economy enables the U.S. to enjoy noninflationary increases in production much greater than once imagined . He now concedes that this picture has been temporarily pushed aside . " For the first time in over a decade , " he says , " a standard business-cycle pattern is moving front and center . " <P> Why ? Most important , of course , because the Federal Reserve under Chairman Alan Greenspan has been raising interest rates for just short of a year to slow a runaway boom . Members of TIME 's board differ considerably on how soon and how hard those rate hikes will bite . But all agree on two predictions : 1 ) there will indeed be a slowdown ; 2 ) the chance that it will turn into a recession is , in Sinai 's word , " zero . " Diane Swonk , chief economist of Bank One and president of the National Association for Business Economics , declares , " I expect this expansion to last until 2004 "  --  which is as far as she will predict . <P> At present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the economy 's overall momentum is still quite powerful . Total production of goods and services rocketed ahead at an annual rate of 5.4% in the first quarter . That was below the superheated 7.3% pace in the previous three months yet still well above what the wildest optimists would consider a sustainable pace . However , Chris Varvares , president of Macroeconomic Advisers , a consulting firm with headquarters in St. Louis , Mo. , expects a " fairly abrupt " slowing in the second half of the year to below 3% , which will hold gross-domestic-product growth for the year to 5% . Ed Yardeni , chief economist of Deutsche Bank , agrees , largely because he believes the skyrocketing rise of stock prices in late 1999 and early this year " most likely did contribute to boosting car sales and housing-related sales . " With the NASDAQ index by late May down roughly a third from its March peak , he says , " within the next couple of months we 'll find weaker car sales , weaker retail sales , weaker housing activity . " Varvares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 , though he thinks the pace will pick up again by next year 's end .
