The moment he turned the corner onto Rampart Street , he knew he was a dead man . A shadow was moving directly in his path , a phantom in a dark duster , one arm outstretched and pointing a Navy .45 . He started to say , Not me ! But he only got as far as the first word when the other hand came up , the palm out , shushing him . From down past Second Street , he heard a trumpet blowing , a slow run of dirty brass . Jass they called it . He fixed on that odd word for a moment , seeking escape . Then he was back facing the pistol , feeling its ghostly touch over twelve feet of space . He had lived for years with the fear that someone would come for him . He had paid in sleepless nights . He had seen a shady figure in his dreams , stepping out of a darkness just like this one . It was n't fair . He was n't the villain ; he was the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn your- " when the pistol shouted and the .45 slug caught him under the chin , snapping his head back and choking off the words in a bloody cough . The shot echoed down Rampart Street as he staggered and toppled over , clutching at his throat , his life bleeding out to seep around the cobblestones . The shadow faded back into the inky New Orleans night . Across the narrow street , a curtain opened , hung suspended for a moment , and then closed . One minute passed in silence . It lingered into a second , then a third . The stream of blood ran to the gutter , a feast for the flies at the first light of day . There was a patter of footsteps , rat quick , from the far side of the street . A crabbed figure bent over the body , rustling through pockets , pulling the heavy piece from the right-hand ring finger . When the wedding band would n't budge from the left hand , a blade flashed on its way to dismembering the digit and the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job could be done , a trio of men appeared , the last dregs flushed out onto the street from Johnny O 's Saloon , hooting drunkenly as they staggered up to the corner . In the one-two-three order of a vaudeville routine , they came to a stop . Their mouths dropped and six bleary eyes swam over to the body lying in the street and the other form that was bending over it . One of the drunks , finding his voice , yelled , " Hey , now ! " The crabbed figure jerked back and scurried away just as fast as he 'd come . The three fellows slowed to a series of nervous baby steps as they drew up on the body . The first one saw the ugly hole in the victim 's throat and said , " Sweet Jesus ! Look at that ! " A stunned few seconds passed , and then the fellow who had spoken up went stumbling back to the call box that was mounted on the light post , just down Rampart Street . transmitted in any form or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recording , or any information storage and retrieval system , without permission in writing from the publisher .
