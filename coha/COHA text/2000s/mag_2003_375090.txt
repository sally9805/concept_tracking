Standing on the deck of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln last week , George W. Bush declared the Iraq war largely over . It was a majestic occasion even if you knew that its majesty had been carefully stage-managed . Bush , who had just the right **26;16391;TOOLONG look , had apparently even taken the controls for part of the flight from San Diego to the Lincoln . The White House could hardly have done more to ensure a big audience ; the speech interrupted that hallowed American tradition called Friends . The central purpose of all the pageantry was to soothe us : We 're winning the war on terrorism , the worst is over , let 's get back to work . <P> But on the very day that Bush was declaring provisional victory over Baghdad , a notable skirmish in another war was quietly under way in Washington . This is a war without daily briefings by self-assured Bush men and women . It 's the war over how to make America safer without turning it into a police state  --  how to mediate the difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from over . <P> On Thursday , Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee defeated a White House attempt to give the CIA and the Pentagon new and unusual authority to investigate U.S. citizens . It would have been the first time in U.S. history that these two institutions were openly authorized to probe into the lives of Americans . In a closed-door meeting of the Intelligence Committee , Democrats rejected a measure that would have allowed the CIA and the Pentagon to issue " national security letters " requiring Internet providers , credit-card companies and other institutions to cough up the personal and financial records of their customers . Says a U.S. intelligence official : " Periodically since 9/11 , the folks on the Hill have asked , ' Geez , what kind of authorities would make your job easier ? ' And so that proposal was proposed . " <P> The war on terrorism may be launching a legal revolution in America . The changes pose these questions : How necessary are some of the reforms ? Have John Ashcroft and the Justice Department unraveled constitutional protections in trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil-liberties price to be paid as we adopt various national-security initiatives , " says Mary Jo White , a former U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York , whose office pursued some of the biggest terrorism cases of the 1990s . " For the most part , I think that price is necessary . But what I worry about is government officials who find the answers too easy in this arena . " <P> None of the answers are simple . Who would n't have authorized an extra wiretap or a longer detention if it could have prevented 9/11 , but who knows how far to go ? As the demands of security bump up against the safeguards of personal liberty , clashes have been breaking out around the country over where to draw the line . Librarians are alerting visitors that their Internet surfing or book borrowing may be monitored by the government . Nearly 100 towns and counties , plus the state of Hawaii , have passed resolutions condemning the USA Patriot Act , the post-9/11 law that greatly expanded federal powers to conduct the war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
