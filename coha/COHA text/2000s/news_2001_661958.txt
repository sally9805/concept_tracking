In a wind-swept corner of northeastern Oregon , 1,000 earth-covered bunkers stretch across the landscape like the evenly spaced squares of a Hershey 's chocolate bar . Antelopes and skittish jackrabbits graze between the mounds . <p> The U.S. Army stores nearly 4,000 tons of chemicals here , at the Umatilla Chemical Depot - two types of deadly nerve gas and blister chemical . The poisons sit a short walk from the cavernous incinerator that will begin destroying them in 2003 . <p> Almost two years ago , 34 construction workers began coughing , vomiting and gasping for air while they worked in an unfinished incinerator building . <p> What sickened them remains a mystery . <p> " Typically , there is some telltale event like a leaking valve or a broken tank . That did not happen here , " said Carl Halgren , the area director of the U.S. Occupational and Safety Administration which investigated . <p> Unable to get the answers they want , the workers have sued , claiming the Army covered up a chemical leak , a charge it denies . <p> Halgren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ' eyes , I knew they were not making this up . Something happened , " he said . " The sad thing is , I ca n't tell them what it was . " <p> On that September day in 1999 , Jim Shaffer watched men stagger past him just before he was knocked to his knees by a violent cough . He crawled to the nearest doorway , vomiting bile , and was pulled out by his friend , Brian Zasso . <p> " This was a fight for your life to get out . Every breath hurt , " Zasso said . <p> It was 11:05 a.m . <p> From that point on , memories and official records of what happened that day diverge . The workers claim conspiracy and neglect . The Army and Raytheon , the company that built the incinerator , recount an efficient response to an industrial accident . <p> Bruce Raymond , then-site safety manager for Raytheon , said his paramedics divided workers based on the severity of their symptoms and cared for them in that order . <p> The workers did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinpoint pupils - so paramedics treated them for inhalation of industrial fumes , Raymond said . <p> Zasso , Shaffer and another worker , Tony Kimball , said they went to an emergency clinic operated by Raytheon where they found other construction workers waiting to be treated . Zasso carried Kimball to the clinic because he was too weak to walk . <p> There , paramedics told them to sit in the sand outside the clinic , the workers say . Zasso said the clinic staff took their names , but did not give them any medical care - or water - for more than one hour . <p> Raymond , who now works in Maryland , questions how sick some of the tradesmen were . <p> " Most of them just stood around outside talking and smoking cigarettes , arguing about who was going to ride to the hospital with whom , " said Raymond , who was at the scene within 10 minutes . <p> More than one hour later , at 12:22 p.m. , vans filled with 34 sick construction workers left for Good Shepherd Hospital , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical staff would not take the workers to the emergency room until he threatened to call the local newspaper on his cell phone . <p> Lt. Col. Tom Woloszyn , the depot commander , said the workers delayed the trip to the hospital because they insisted on a union driver - a charge the workers deny . <p> About 40 minutes later , the vans arrived at the emergency room , where the workers were treated for inhalation of an unknown chemical , hospital records show . Three were admitted overnight , Raytheon reports show . <p> Ken Franz , director of the emergency room , said Raytheon paramedics did not call to warn his staff that 34 patients were arriving . Raymond said his paramedics called ahead three times . <p> Like the Raytheon paramedics , Franz said his staff immediately ruled out sarin exposure because the workers did not have pinpoint pupils . <p> Several nurses said later that they got sick from fumes coming off the workers ' clothing , Raytheon 's final report said . Franz contends that never happened . <p> Before Army workers could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the testing machines needed to warm up . The machines were turned off because all the Army chemical workers were at a retirement luncheon that day , depot commander Woloszyn said . <p> At 2:20 p.m. , more than three hours after the workers fell ill , the Army began testing for sarin gas leaks , according to Army records . Chemical experts tested with mobile machines that use long rubber hoses to suck up air samples . They then checked the samples for traces of deadly nerve gas or mustard chemicals . <p> Workers took air samples outside the concrete bunkers that store the chemical weapons because they believed traces of toxic gas would be strongest closest to any leaking weapon , Woloszyn said . The tests were negative , he said . <p> The bunkers are about two football fields away from where the construction workers got sick . <p> Nearly one hour later - and more than four hours after the incident - the Army tested inside the incinerator building where Shaffer , Kimball and the others were working . But no tests were done in the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records . <p> Phillip Ferguson , who at the time was responsible for monitoring and testing for chemical leaks , said no one was at the incinerator building to tell him where the men fell ill . He said he had no way of knowing where to take air samples . <p> He chose three test sites based on wind direction and his own knowledge that sarin gas usually pools at low elevations . He tested in rooms where only one worker got sick - but he did n't know that at the time , he said . <p> Woloszyn said 1,200 people - security guards , groundspeople and other construction workers - were working in and around the incinerator building , but only the 34 workers took ill . Everyone would have been affected if it was a leak of sarin gas , he said . <p> " Chemical agents are n't selective . They do n't go around and tap some people , " he said . <p> Nearly two years later , the workers are still fighting symptoms that began that day . The Army agrees the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Shaffer , the 55-year-old pipefitter , has asthma attacks , violent coughing fits , headaches , mouth sores , blotchy skin , night sweats and depression . He spends 26 minutes a day inhaling vaporized steroids to help him breathe . <p> A hint of perfume , air freshener or diesel fuel can make Shaffer cough so hard that strangers back away , afraid that he has tuberculosis . For months , his gums bled and the skin on the tips of his fingers peeled away . <p> Shaffer 's wife , Natalie , reports to her bank teller 's job exhausted each day because his coughing keeps her awake . She changes the bed sheets every three days because they are drenched in his sweat . <p> " You learn to live with the pain , but it still crushes on you and drives on you . I 'm in misery all the time , " he said . " I 'm more concerned about my wife 's future than my own . I do n't have one . " <p> The Shaffers are not alone . Eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. District Court in May . Three have not returned to work . Seven can not hold construction jobs because they can no longer tolerate breathing industrial fumes . One , Kimball , tried to commit suicide . <p> Shaffer recently sold the six-bedroom home he built by hand and moved into a one-bedroom apartment off a busy highway to help pay his medical bills . <p> Kimball , a single father , put his $180,000 house on the market in May . He plans to move with his three teen-age daughters into the basement of his parents ' home . <p> " I 've been watching my health deteriorate for two years . It 's hell . It 's a living hell , " he said . " I just want to feel like a person again .
