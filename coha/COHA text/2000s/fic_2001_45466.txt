NOBODY REMEMBERS <p> Addison anymore . And not just because so much like misery has passed our way since . No , I blame the Russians . I mean , it was the same day they sent Yuri Gagarin into space , so Addison was pretty much pushed to the back pages . The whole world fell for the diversion . Who would n't ? It 's not like Addison was something anybody wanted to talk about , after all . I can vouch for that firsthand ; I 've told the whole story only once . But that does n't mean I do n't remember . Every time I turn on Brokaw or pick up a Sun-Times or think of my sister , Meggie , I remember . I sure as hell remember . <p> April 12 , 1961 . The three of us huddled about that bug jar as if it were a crystal ball , revealing the shape of our respective things to come . And though it was , in fact , neither made of crystal nor imbued with any mystic foresight , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the jar , among the carcasses of crickets , grasshoppers and anonymous creepy  --  crawlies , lay the tiniest of skeletons - a human skeleton too , so it appeared , though none of us had much of a handle on anatomy . <p> " Where 's the head ? " Werner wanted to know . " It does n't have a friggin ' head . " Howie Werner . Three seconds on the scene and a total pain  --  in-the-ass as usual . <p> " By the moss , " Timmy pointed . " It must 've rolled away when I took it down . " The jar had been sitting on a shelf in Timmy Gobel 's shed since the previous summer . " See it ? See it ? " <p> " Wow , friggin ' tiny , eh ? " <p> " Yeah , " said Timmy , " friggin ' is right . " <p> I nodded in agreement . I was tall even then , though a lot thinner , and splattered with more freckles than any single kid deserved . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so creeped me out , I could not speak . Nor could I let on . Not with Werner around . If he sensed the slightest weakness , I would never hear the end of it . Still , I could not turn away from the jar . <p> " Wait a sec ! " Werner snorted , eyes bulging like he 'd just found the secret to life . " Wait just one friggin ' second ! " And there it was , that dreaded hee-haw , his lips and gums and teeth screwed up tight like some donkey snout in an overcinched bridle , that grating laugh that just begged to be silenced with a fist to the face . " You got us , Gobe . You got us good , man . So where 'd you get it , anyhow ? Cracker Jacks ? Neat . Real neat . " <p> " No , I swear . I thought that too - that somebody was pulling a fast one on me . Like it broke off a key chain or something . But it 's real , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the jar . It had come with the stamp collecting kit his grandmother had sent for his eleventh birthday , but this was the first time he had used it for anything other than barbecuing ants or branding hockey pads . " Look , around its middle , see .... " <p> I put my eye right up to it and pulled back just as fast ; a tad slower and I might well have puked . <p> " And at the back of the head ... see ... see ... , " Timmy directed . " Jesus ! " Werner did n't look too well himself . " Looks like ... uh ... , " he gulped , " rotting guts ... and ... and ... uh ... Jesus ... hair and stuff .... What the hell is it , Gobe ? You bump off a friggin ' leprechaun ? " <p> Timmy shook his head , shrugged . <p> " Well , I 'll tell you one thing , if it 's an elf you got lyin ' in there , you could be up for murder one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having Werner around - putting up with his crap was inevitably rewarded with his cockeyed take on things . If he was n't getting on your nerves , Werner made you laugh . And even the slightest sign of approval would cause him to follow through with a litany of adlibbed hits and misses . One could almost hear his brain working , if not his sense of logic . " Or what if some headshrinker from the jungle or somewhere shrunk some guy 's body ? And then tossed it out of a plane flying over ? " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " Or maybe it 's one of those African pygmies . Like in that dumb Tarzan movie . " <p> " Anybody ever tell you you 're nuts , Werner ? " It was not the first time Timmy had posed the question . " Pygmies are small , but not that small . And headshrinkers ? Jesus ! " <p> " Besides , " I said , voice barely above a whisper , " would n't there be a spear or something in there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's take a closer look .... " Werner reached for the jar , but Timmy fended him off . <p> " Back off , asshole ! You 'll wreck him up . Look what happened to his head . " <p> " Maybe it did n't roll away , " I suggested , every word a chore . " Maybe the grasshopper bit it off . " <p> " Yeah ! " Werner cut in . " Maybe you did n't see him , Gobe , ' cause he was inside the grasshopper . Maybe the grasshopper had swallowed him whole , just before you caught it . " <p> " Except I do n't think grasshoppers eat meat , " I corrected , careful not to overstate the point . <p> " Then maybe it was a costume . Maybe he was dressed up like a grasshopper , you know , for Halloween or whatever ? " <p> " You 're saying he was going trick-or-treating dressed like a grasshopper ? Jesus , Werner , even if he could reach the doorbell , he 'd no sooner ring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of silence followed before we realized what Timmy had said . We collapsed onto the grass , aching with laughter . <p> " Or what ... what ... , " Werner howled , " ... what if they 're Martians ... dressed up like ... like ... like friggin ' grasshoppers to fool us ? " " It 's a friggin ' Martian grasshopper invasion ! " cried Timmy . " Run ! Run for your lives ! " He flipped to his feet . " The Martians are coming ! The Martians are coming ! " <p> " Yeah , " I grinned , " Martians . " <p> IT TOOK a long while before we got back on track . Oddly , it was I who broke the silence , an occurrence only slightly less rare than finding a tiny skeleton at the bottom of a bug jar . Eyes riveted to my PF Flyers , heels perpendicular , I spoke softly , tentatively . " What if it 's your conscience , Gobe ? " I thought for sure we 'd all crack up again - me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one as good as any Werner could muster . But Timmy looked like he 'd just been handed a fistful of liver . <p> " My what ? " <p> " You know , your conscience , " I repeated , hoping they 'd pick up on my grin . Hell , it was a big grin too . " The little guy inside your head who tells you right from wrong . " I swallowed , sighed . It was n't the first time this had happened ; people never seemed to catch on when I was pulling their leg . <p> " Huh ? You mean like in cartoons ? Like the little devil who sits on your shoulder ? " <p> " Yeah , sort of , I guess . I was thinking that maybe he fell out of your ear when you were bug hunting or whatever . " I was about to tell them I was only kidding , but then Werner jammed his thumbs up into his armpits and began flapping his elbows , squawking saliva into my face . <p> " Cuckoo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! " <p> Timmy scratched his head , weighing the latest theory . " But if I do n't have a conscience - I mean , if I 've lost mine - and if I 've been without one since that guy got stuck in the jar , would n't I have been doing a whole bunch of bad things since then ? I do n't think I have , have I ? " <p> It had come this far , now I felt obliged to take it all the way . " That 's just it , Gobe . If this little guy is your conscience , you would n't have any way of knowing if you 've been doing bad things , because you would n't have any conscience to tell you . " <p> " But you guys would know if I was doing bad stuff , ' cause I probably would 've done some of it to you - and definitely to Werner . And have I ? Have I been doing bad stuff ? " <p> " Oh , yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of it . Robbed a bank . Spray-painted fuck you ' all over the school . Swiped some cars . Jerked off on Meggie Patterson 's boobs - " <p> " Shut up , " I stammered , face red , fingers pressed into fists . I hated when they talked about my sister like that . Heck , I hated when they talked about her at all . <p> " Jesus , Gobe , you 're not really listening to this nut case , are you ? This conscience bullshit makes about as much sense as my pygmy . " <p> " Shut up , will ya , Werner ? For one friggin ' second , just shut the hell up and let me think . " Timmy might as well have been talking to the damn wall for all Werner seemed to care . The more you wanted him to clam up , the more he prattled on . <p> " Well , I can tell you one thing , Gobe , if there 's some little guy running around inside my head , telling me what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn Q-tip I can find .... " <p> Perhaps it was in the delivery , maybe that 's why the three of us were on the grass again , done in by Werner 's latest quip . There was just something funny about the way Werner said things , not what he said . <p> After that , the theorizing and speculation pretty much withered away . We hit the wall , so to speak . Just plain stumped . Clearly , a higher authority was called for . <p> " Mr. Schwartz ? Or how about Miss Corcoran ? " Werner suggested . Timmy shook his head . " Uh-uh . No teachers . " School never did sit too well with Timmy . This was in the days before terms like " learning disability " and " attention deficit disorder " were bandied about - before Ritalin made the menu alongside milk and cookies . So it came down to your basic standoff on pretty much a daily basis ; he did n't take to teachers and they did n't take to him . Hell , he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when hippies were warning us to never trust anyone over thirty , I 'd often think of Timmy Gobel and how he was so far ahead of his time . " Uh-uh . No friggin ' teachers . " <p> That 's when I offered up Meggie . Just like that . I had n't meant to , swear to God . But the words were on my tongue and out of my mouth before I knew what I was saying . " She 's really good at science and stuff . Got that scholarship and .... " <p> " Yeah , Meggie , " Werner seconded , dancing around like he 'd just scored a touchdown . Any excuse to be near Meggie was good enough for him . But to me , his enthusiasm was downright stomach-wrenching . <p> I was pretty sure that Timmy was excited about the prospect of Meggie too , but he had the good sense to keep his feelings in check . He also saw a downside . " I do n't know if Meggie is such a good idea . Then your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " <p> " Yeah , " Werner groaned . " They 'll mess everything up . That jar is ours . " " Mine , " Timmy corrected . " It 's my jar . " <p> " Yeah , yeah . Whatever . " <p> " My folks are away until Sunday , " I said . " And I do n't think Meggie will say a word . My Mom 's always complaining how Meggie does n't tell her anything . " <p> " Yeah , okay then . Meggie it is . " That was another thing I picked up about Timmy . He always seemed to worry about coming off looking like a kid in front of Meggie , even if that 's what he was compared to her ; we were barely into high school , whereas she was almost done . " What if it 's just some bug skeleton that looks like a human ? What if she thinks we 're just being stupid ? <p> " Bugs do n't have skeletons , " I assured . " Besides , Gobe , Meggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jar , while Timmy and Werner studied Meggie , her yellow short-shorts , her polka-dot halter , her bare belly , her .... If it came down to Connie Stevens or Meggie Patterson , who 'd you choose ? What about Debbie Reynolds - her or Meggie Patterson ? Between Sandra Dee and Meggie Patterson ? Hayley Mills or Meggie Patterson ? The way Timmy Gobel and Howie Werner saw it , it was no contest ; Meggie came out on top , fantasy after fantasy . Heck , more than once , I had guys suck up to me just to get close to her . Sometimes I wondered if I would 've had any friends at all if my sister were n't so damn pretty . <p> " So what is it , Meg ? " I prodded . I wanted to get them the hell away from her fast . <p> " Or , more importantly , who is it ? " Werner anted , working hard to impress . <p> But Meggie seemed not to hear a word ; she brushed past us and set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot bigger than Timmy 's . " Could be any number of things , " she speculated quietly . " Extraterrestrial life form . A new species . A genetic mutation . The missing link .... " <p> " Shit . You saying it fell off some guy 's friggin ' shirtsleeve ? Is that what you 're saying ? " <p> " Jeez , Werner ! " Timmy moaned , hoping to distance himself , in Meggie 's eyes , at least . " Not that kind of missing link , you idiot ! " <p> Meggie remained oblivious , the contents of the jar continuing to mesmerize . <p> Werner blushed . " I knew that . I was just kidding . Gripes ! Ca n't a guy joke around here ? Everybody 's so friggin ' serious all of a sudden .... " That was the odd thing about Werner , with girls around , he was never particularly funny . <p> " It demands closer scrutiny , " Meggie announced , primarily to herself . With the jar snugly against her , she marched with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us at her sandaled heels , me doing my best to obscure my friends ' view of my sister 's backside . <p> With Timmy 's permission , Meggie tweezered the skull out of the jar and set it under her microscope . She was going to cure cancer someday ; that 's what she always said , anyhow . <p> I suggested we go play ball in the park until Meggie was done , but no one took me up on it . The closest Timmy and Werner had ever come to Meggie 's bedroom was in their fantasies ; they were not about to trade the moment for a game of pitch and catch . <p> Meggie went to work . First , she put her eye to the lens , then she 'd jot down a note , then she 'd go back to the lens , make an adjustment or two , and then jot down another note . She spoke only once , to scold Werner for sitting on her bed . " What 'd I do ? " he whined . " What 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might never be done , when she pushed back from the desk and swiveled her chair to face us . Eyebrows raised , blue eyes wide , ponytail bobbing , she shifted her gaze from me to Werner to the owner of the jar . " Tommy , is n't it ? Tommy Gobel ? " <p> Timmy nodded eagerly . Meggie knew his name ! Meggie knew his name ! Well , almost , anyhow . <p> " Now you said you found this where , Tommy ? " <p> " I do n't know . I was just going through some junk in our shed , when I came across the old bug jar . Heck , I do n't even remember the last time I used it . Ages ago , maybe , I think . I mean , I 'm way too old to collect bugs and - " I 'd never thought of last summer as ages ago , but if that was the way Timmy saw it , I was n't going to question him . Not in front of Meggie , anyhow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " <p> " Yeah . Weird , eh ? " <p> " ' Weird ' is a good word , all right . It 's the strangest thing , " she said , " but I 've been observing your find for the last twenty minutes and  --  well ... I ... uh - I think you should see what I see . " <p> Timmy peered into the microscope . " Has it changed or is it just me ? " " Oh , yes , " Meggie said , " it has definitely changed . " <p> " Lemme look . " Werner pushed through to the microscope . " Holy friggin ' cow ! Holy friggin ' cow ! " <p> " What is it ? " I said . " What 's going on ? " <p> " See for yourself , " my sister urged . <p> " No . You tell me , Meg . What is it ? What 's changing ? " <p> " The little man , " she said . " I 'm not sure how to say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " <p> " What ? " I had no idea what she was talking about . <p> Timmy swallowed . " We thought he was rotting , right ? But that 's not it at all , guys . He ... he 's .... " <p> " What the fuh - ? " <p> " Huh ? " <p> Meggie returned to the microscope . " His hair ... his flesh ... he 's not losing it , " she whispered , as if recording notes for future reference . " If anything , he appears to be regenerating . " <p> " You mean like he 's growing stuff back ? " <p> " Exactly , " Meggie nodded , the weight of the mystery squarely upon her shoulders . " Look , I do n't know what we have here , but we 'd better tell someone about it . " <p> " Who ? Who we gon na tell ? " Timmy 's defenses shot up around him like a bamboo stockade . " I just knew bringing it here was gon na be a mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was just going to say we bring it to Miss Corcoran , her being a biology teacher and all . " <p> Timmy folded his arms across his chest . " No way . No teachers . And especially not her . " <p> Meggie looked to me for support . " What 's his problem ? " <p> Timmy answered for me . " I do n't want any grownups in on this , okay ? They 'll just mess everything up . " <p> " But this is serious , " Meggie stressed . " I certainly do n't know what to make of it . I do n't think anybody 's ever seen anything like this . " <p> " How do you know ? " Timmy fired back . " Maybe they see things like this all the time , and keep it from us . Maybe it 's our turn to keep something from them . " <p> " Well , I 'm not about to merely sit here with it , " Meggie stated firmly . " We are going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in . " Let 's eat . I 'm starved . " <p> IWAS REACHING for my second slice of pizza when I caught the twitch out the corner of my eye . But I could n't get the words out to tell the others . All I could do was point at the jar , saliva bubbles popping across my lips . Meggie frowned , certain I was just horsing around , but then she saw the twitch too . The skeleton 's legs were moving , in slow wavy ripples , like tiny strips of bacon on a frying pan . <p> " Jesus ! " <p> " Jesus ! " <p> " Holy friggin ' shit . " <p> Meggie held her magnifying glass against the jar . <p> " Is it hatching or something ? " Werner asked . <p> " It 's already hatched , idiot , " Timmy snapped . " Now we 're waiting to see what it turns into . " <p> " Maybe some friggin ' butterfly . " <p> " Maybe some loud-mouthed idiot . " <p> " Up yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " My goodness , " Meggie gasped . " It 's not - not a - not a he . " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " It 's a woman , " Meggie announced . <p> " What ? A girl ? " <p> " A woman , " Meggie repeated , " Your little man appears to be a woman . " <p> " How can you tell ? " asked Werner , but we all ignored him . <p> Meggie scurried back to the microscope . " Let me see if .... My God ! The head ! The head is gone ! Where 's the head ? Where 's the head ? " <p> We must have looked quite the sight , leaping about in all directions , but Meggie stopped us cold . " Do n't move , you idiots . You 'll step on it . Just stay where you are and tell me if you see it . " <p> Heads panned the room . The carpet . The bed . The desk . Dead silence . Except for Timmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heimlich maneuver had been around , surely one of us would have offered to perform it . But in those days , the choking either took care of itself or I guess you simply died . <p> " You okay ? " I called to him . We were all concerned . Well , maybe not Meggie - not entirely ; she probably figured he was just horsing around too . <p> Timmy rapped his chest a few times , coughed , and then shook his head , slapping his face as if there were water in his ear . " I 'm okay , " he said at last , voice ragged . <p> " That 's what you get for bolting pizza , " stated Meggie . " Now if it 's all right with the rest of you clowns , I suggest we resume our search . " <p> I spotted it almost immediately . I doubled over , cradling my gut . " Oh , Jesus ! I 'm going to be sick . It 's there , " I pointed . " There . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny head sitting atop the lid . The now tiny and hairy head . <p> " Jesus ! " <p> " How in the hell ... ? " <p> Timmy grabbed Werner by the collar and parked his knuckles under his friend 's chin . " Did you do this , asshole ? Did you ? " <p> " Nobody did this , " said Meggie . " It did it on its own . " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " I think , " she said , " it 's trying to pull itself together .... " <p> " Be a good idea if you did the same , " Werner cautioned Timmy , breaking free of his grip . <p> Meggie unscrewed the lid and carefully lowered the head into the jar , releasing it atop the now motionless torso . " I do n't care what you say , I am taking this to Miss Corcoran now . " <p> Timmy blocked the door . <p> " Out of my way , little boy , " she ordered . <p> " Uh-uh . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of my way . " <p> " Gim me my jar . " <p> " You 're not being reasonable , Tommy . You do n't seem to understand what we have here . This could make us famous . Do you understand  --  famous ? Maybe even rich . " <p> " Gim me my jar . " <p> Again , Meggie looked to me . " Would you please try to talk some sense into your friend ? " <p> I shrugged . " Maybe you should just give him the jar , " I said . <p> " Great . " Meggie rolled her eyes . " Thank you for your help , brother dear . You are such a retard at times .... " Timmy saw his opening . He grabbed for the jar , but Meggie spun out of his way and deftly cached the trophy in no man 's land - between her breasts . Timmy gawked before her , at a loss as to what to do next . But not Werner . He threw himself from the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them smashed onto the floor and rolled through what was left of the pizza . They were still picking pepperoni off their shirts before they realized Meggie had made good her escape . By the time we got outside , her green Corvair was tearing round the corner . <p> " Where does she live ? " Timmy demanded . <p> " My sister ? " I thought he 'd lost his marbles . <p> " Corcoran . Corcoran . Where does she live ? " <p> " Oh ... her . I do n't know . " I wish to hell I would 've shut up then and there , instead of rattling on the way I did . It was n't like me . Must 've been nerves . I chalk it up to nerves . " She 's probably still at school . Meggie says she stays real late most days , doing science things or whatever . Meggie 's over there with her all the time . Drives my Mom nuts . That 's how she got her scholarship . I .... " My tongue continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his bike , his legs pumping furiously . I might yet be talking if Werner had n't interrupted . " Where the hell is he going ? " Werner wondered . " School 's the other way . " <p> " Beats me , " I said . " Maybe he 's going to tell his Dad or something . " <p> " His Dad ? " Werner laughed . " Gobe tell his Dad ? Yeah , right . Do n't hold your breath on that one , pal . Looks to me like he 's thickening out . " <p> " Maybe , " I said , not buying it for a second . <p> Werner and I continued on in Meggie 's wake to Addison High . We were both curious as to what Miss Corcoran would have to say about the creepy little thing , and that led to fresh speculation . Werner asked if I 'd ever seen the movie , The Incredible Shrinking Man , where this guy keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller until he can slip through the holes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't befallen one of Timmy 's neighbors , before Timmy scooped him or her into his bug jar . Finally , we decided that it was either a visitor from outer space or a time traveler from the future . How we arrived at these conclusions , I can not say , but at the time they seemed to be the most logical . The school parking lot and Meggie 's Corvair were in view when Werner took our conversation on a whole other tack : " Think your sister might go out with me now  --  on a date or something ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " You know , seeing how I got Gobe off her back and stuff ... ? " <p> " There 's a piece of pepperoni on your shoulder , " I said . <p> Schools were n't the armed fortresses they are today . As I recall , Addison High did n't even have locks on the doors . But , I can tell you , the whole scene unfolded as mighty spooky , and not solely because a resurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . There 's just something sacrilegious about a school after hours . Hollow corridors bled silent . Doomsday lighting , dying fluorescents stuttering overhead . Misshapen shadows on tired linoleum . And every tap , crack , and whisper booming back tenfold from battered lockers . <p> If Meggie 's magnifying glass was big compared to Timmy 's , you should have seen Miss Corcoran 's . It was like something Jack might have swiped from the giant during one of his forays up the beanstalk . And there she was , looking up from her desk , peering at us through the glass as we shuffled into the classroom , her magnified right eye nailing us to the door . Jesus ! Werner and I must 've jumped a mile . " Yes ? " she said , " is there something I can do for you ? " Her voice was an ongoing experiment in elocution . <p> " It 's my brother and his friend , " Meggie explained . <p> " Oh , yes . Of course . " The biology teacher pretended to recognize us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you boys take a seat and be quiet about it . It seems we have quite the mystery on our hands . " <p> Force of habit sent the two of us toward the rear of the room , but Corcoran swiftly added , " Where I can see you , if you do n't mind , gentlemen ? " We took our places in the first row . <p> Timmy 's bug jar sat on the desk in the middle of Miss Corcoran 's ink blotter . The two examined the jar together , Miss Corcoran in her oak swivel , Meggie standing behind and leaning over the teacher 's shoulder . " And I 'm telling you , " Meggie noted , " not thirty minutes ago her head was completely detached . Completely . " <p> " Her ? It 's not exactly a female , dear . " <p> " But she was , Miss . I 'm telling you she was . Honest . " <p> " Odd . How very , very odd . And you say it was moving ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . The head too , I guess . But nobody saw how . One moment it was under my microscope , the next it was sitting on top of the jar . " <p> " Well , the former simply may have been a trompe l'oeil , dear , while the latter may indeed have a very sound explanation - grounded in mischief , perhaps ? " This time , Miss Corcoran lowered her magnifying glass as she looked our way . Werner and I shrugged , our sense of guilt rising under the teacher 's glare , despite our absolute innocence . I could hardly believe what she was doing . And I do n't think Meggie could believe it either . Here , the teacher had something no one had ever seen before , sitting right on top of her desk , and she was taking time out to accuse Werner and me of mischief ! The tension that followed was immediate . Miss Corcoran manipulated silence the way a conductor wields a baton . But the silence did n't last . <p> " Gim me my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us seeing or hearing I do not know . But from my perspective , he had arrived in the nick of time . " Gim me my jar . " <p> " Well , look what the dog dragged in , " declared Miss Corcoran , folding her hands atop the desk , the tips of her pinkies grazing the jar . She glanced at the clock on the wall . " I do n't believe I 've seen you in school this late since your last detention , Mr. Gobel . Have you come for another ? " <p> " Gim me my jar . " <p> " I suggest you change your tone of voice , young man . " <p> " Gim me my jar . " <p> " In my thirty years of teaching , I have never once tolerated rudeness and you are making a very big mistake , young man , if you suspect that I am about to begin now . " <p> " It 's my jar , " Timmy said , and from behind his back he pulled a gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . The souvenir . <p> Meggie gasped , her hand at her mouth , looking to Miss Corcoran for guidance . But the teacher was unswayed - and perhaps severely nearsighted as well . " Now I 'm going to say it once and only once , Mr. Gobel . You will turn around , you will quietly go out the door , and you will make yourself very scarce indeed , before you do something the two of us will surely regret . " <p> Timmy pulled the trigger . Behind Miss Corcoran and Meggie , the blackboard exploded , shards of slate crashing to the floor . <p> " Jesus , Gobe ! " Werner cried , as he ducked under the desk . " Are you out of your friggin ' mind ? " <p> Was I the only one who noticed ? Was the creepy little thing in the jar not standing ? Were its arms not above its head at full extension ? Look ! Look ! I wanted to shout . Look ! Look ! It 's watching us . But I could barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Nothing happened . Once more . Again , nothing . He examined the gun and offhandedly placed it on a desk . The worst appeared over , thank God . <p> Miss Corcoran surveyed the damage , her finger wagging eternal damnation . " This is an outrage . Addison High School is no place for miscreants and vandals , Mr. Gobel , and this is indeed vandalism at its most extreme mindlessness . Do you know what it comes down to , Miss Patterson ? " Meggie shook her head ; she had n't moved an inch , not even when the blackboard had shattered . " It 's breeding . I 've said it time and again , it all comes down to breeding . " <p> Timmy turned his back . I relaxed , relieved at the retreat . There was still a chance for him , I thought . At best , I figured , he 'd be suspended . At worst , a couple of months up at the boy 's farm in Pepperell . But what none of us had noticed was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propped in the corner beside the door . He swung the shotgun up and around , leveled the barrels at Miss Corcoran and fired . Boom ! Boom ! Just like that . Boom ! Boom ! The biology teacher and my sister , Meggie , crumpled to the floor behind the desk . The wall where the blackboard had been was covered in blood and God-knows-what-else . <p> Seeing Meggie fall must have been more than Werner could stomach . He threw off the desk that was his shelter and stumbled to his feet , arms flailing , furniture toppling . " Are you out of your friggin ' mind , Gobe ? Are you , Gobe ? Are you ? " And using a chair as a shield , he flung himself at Timmy for the second time that day . Timmy side-stepped the chair , raised the shotgun and caught Werner mid-flight with the butt - the crack of impact at least as loud as the bullet that had struck the blackboard . Massive head trauma is what they called it . Massive . <p> The rest unreels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my long safeguarded insanity at a time . Forever distinct and isolated from every other frame . <p> I stand . I do not know what to do . But I know I can not continue to do nothing . <p> Timmy removes the spent shells . <p> I drag myself to Miss Corcoran 's desk . Meggie lies still . Most of Miss Corcoran 's upper half is missing . But the jar remains in the middle of the desk , miraculously untouched , save for a smattering of blood about the lid . I remind myself to breathe . <p> Timmy reloads . <p> I gather up the jar in both hands and extend this offering to Timmy . His shotgun is pointed at my chest . I should expect to die , but I do not . <p> " It 's mine , Patterson . " <p> " I know , Gobe . Please . Take it . " Tears stain my cheeks . I lick my lips , savor the salt . <p> As Timmy lets the shotgun fall to his side , the lid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , it rolls to Timmy 's feet , rattling to a stop against the heel of Werner 's sneaker . Our focus shifts to the inside of the jar . <p> It pulls itself up onto the rim , its face indistinct , its hair - if that 's what you can call it - white , almost crystalline , like the frost on last week 's ice cream . The skeleton may have once appeared human , but the skin that now contains it seems anything but . It is male . Then female . Then male , again . It is like a rainbow in an oil slick . A silverfish with two arms , two legs and a head . A toy soldier in a tinfoil jumpsuit . I hold it in my hands . I stare directly at it . But I can not for the life of me establish what it looks like . It 's here . And then it 's not . It 's there . And then it 's not . <p> It turns its head right , then left , raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel it on my fingers . I see it for an instant as it slithers across my palm . I lose it on my wrist . I spot it at my elbow . It is mercury run wild . Jesus ! Fishbait on the lam . It is on my sleeve . My shoulder . My chin . I try to swat it away . The bug jar smashes to the floor . " Get off ! Get off ! " It 's on my lips , for God 's sake . And then it is in my nose . " Help me , " I 'm crying . " Help me . " <p> And then I do n't know where it is . But I do know that I want to hold Timmy 's shotgun . I want to hold it very much . I want it like I have never wanted anything before . <p> Timmy levels the barrels at my head . " No , Patterson , " he says . " Uhuh . I told you , it 's mine . " He swings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I go down , but I do not go out . I am whisked to the safety of our kitchen , a plate of fried chicken and mashed potatoes and creamed corn before me , and Meggie complaining to Mommy and Daddy that I am the hardest-headed little brat in all of Addison , if not the country . And an instant later I am returned to Miss Corcoran 's biology class . My hands are bleeding , fragments of the bug jar imbedded in my palms . <p> Timmy is on his knees . The barrels of the shotgun are in his mouth . <p> I know even then that I will never forget the expression on his face . The fear . The loneliness . The hate - for himself and God-knows-who-or  --  what-else . I 'm sorry but I just could n't help myself . It is the same expression I will see again and again for the rest of my life . Watching Brokaw . Reading the Sun-Times . Whenever someone will ask about the scars on my palms . Whenever I will think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a firefly on dayshift . And then I don't. *** <p> I told them everything I knew . Everything that happened . Well , to be honest , I told them everything only once . After the first go-round and their reactions , I had the good sense not to mention that among the carcasses of crickets , grasshoppers and anonymous creepy-crawlies in Timmy Gobel 's bug jar lay the tiniest of skeletons , a human skeleton too , so it appeared , though none of us - not Howie Werner , me , or Timmy - had much of a handle on anatomy . Odds are , if I 'd stuck to the real version , I would have ended up in a padded cell somewhere upstate . Frankly , for as long as it lasted , I enjoyed playing the hero , being catered to and such , even though I knew damn well I did n't measure up . But I realized early on that most folks tend to be more comfortable with heroes than mere survivors , as long as they 're not messed up too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw was on the front page of the Addison Weekly Register . <p> STUDENT GUNMAN KILLS THREE , THEN SELF Lone survivor describes massacre <p> But the nurse grabbed the paper away before I got a chance to read the story . Not that I needed to . <p> Like I said , I blame the Russians for the way it turned out . I mean , if they had n't sent Yuri Gagarin into space that day , I 'll bet you anything the investigation would have taken an entirely different route - and maybe we could have nipped this thing in the bud . This epidemic or whatever . What did Timmy call it - the Martian grasshopper invasion ? Hell , would n't surprise me one damn bit if the Russians were in on it from the start . I mean , if not for their diversion , surely someone would have picked up on the fact that when the shotgun fired , when the back of Timmy Gobel 's head blew off , his hands were in his pockets . , <p> Even now , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have glimpsed it . Not a day goes by that I do n't wish it back inside my head . <p> Author Affiliation
