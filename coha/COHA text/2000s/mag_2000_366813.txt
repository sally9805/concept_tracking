Among all the images of six-year-old Elian Gonzalez that we 've seen since he was rescued from the Atlantic last Thanksgiving , the most poignant is his handwriting . Lawyers for Elian 's Miami relatives  --  who refuse to send him back to his father in communist Cuba  --  had the boy himself sign court papers seeking U.S. asylum . Elian , they said , is capable of deciding where he wants to live . But the first-grader 's crude letters betray his tender mind , like the Power Rangers in his toy box . Last week Miami Federal Judge K. Michael Moore dismissed the relatives ' case and agreed with Attorney General Janet Reno that only the Cuban father , Juan Miguel Gonzalez , can speak for a child that young . " Each passing day , " Moore wrote , " is another day lost " between Juan Miguel and Elian . <P> Since the night Elian 's mother drowned while escaping Cuba , leaving him to float on an inner tube for two days , his saga has been as bizarre and unending as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore 's ruling , and myriad other delay tactics await . Meanwhile , Cuban dictator Fidel Castro apparently still wo n't let Juan Miguel , 31 , go to Miami to get Elian . Bottom line : this ugly international custody battle has a few more skirmishes to go before one side can claim victory . <P> The true foes in this fight  --  Castro and Miami 's Cuban-exile lobby , the Cuban-American National Foundation ( CANF )  --  both want their new missile crisis to last and revive the waning influence they enjoyed during the cold war . " They need this fight the way you and I need oxygen , " says Dr. Raul de Velasco , head of the moderate Miami-based Cuban Committee for Democracy . Attorney General Reno insists that keeping Elian here will set a precedent that could in turn make U.S. children legally vulnerable abroad . But at the same time , Al Gore needs Florida votes . As a result , although Reno has demanded that the Miami family stop stalling , the Clinton Administration has little stomach for enforcing its decision to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might erupt in Miami . <P> High-powered Washington attorney Gregory Craig , who defended Bill Clinton in his impeachment trial , has entered the fray as Juan Miguel 's lawyer  --  raising hopes for a quicker end to the case . But Craig , who told TIME he took the job in part because he too has a six-year-old boy , says not even he knows yet when the father will come for Elian . <P> At stake for CANF is nothing less than its role as Miami 's Tammany Hall  --  and as arbiter of Washington 's Cuba policy . Its authoritarian control has weakened in recent years , as has public support for the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba . Last fall , CANF leaders were desperate to counter Castro 's planned visit to the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle , and were saved when Elian washed up as their poster boy . Millionaire chairman Jorge Mas denies the lobby is using Elian : " Our mission is to ensure that this boy gets his due process of law . " But he adds , " We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the world see the hopeless reality of repression in Cuba . "
