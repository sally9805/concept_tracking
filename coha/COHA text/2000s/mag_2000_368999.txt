Robots  --  even ones more intelligent than M.I.T. 's Kismet  --  are coming , the inevitable result of accelerating technological revolutions . The exponential growth of computing , communications , brain scanning and brain " reverse engineering , " combined with rapid miniaturization , will bring machines that can equal or exceed human intelligence within three decades . <P> Is this good news ? Or is this a threat to humanity 's perch of evolutionary superiority ? Alarm at the specter of ceding control over the creative process to machines has catapulted the debate beyond the scientific community and into the public forum . Bill Joy , co-founder of Sun Microsystems , has written about a wide range of dangers that could arise when we no longer have our metaphorical hands " on the plug . " <P> Before we indulge these philosophical concerns , it 's worth exploring just how intelligent and inventive machines are evolving . A powerful paradigm for emulating the creative process in a computer is to copy the ways of nature . One particularly compelling " biologically inspired " approach is actually to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brandeis University professors Jordan Pollack and Hod Lipson recently used " genetic " algorithms to design simple robots , which were then assembled by other robots . General Electric also uses genetic algorithms , in the design of jet engines , and its simulation of evolution produces designs superior to those created by unaided human designers . Microsoft has reportedly evolved some of the software it uses to balance system resources rather than have human programmers explicitly write these codes . <P> Another approach is to create " neural nets "  --  simulated versions of neurons and their massive interconnections that , while highly simplified , are able to solve real-world design problems and come up with unexpected though still appropriate solutions . These and related methods are also used in computer programs that " automatically " create art , music and poetry . The results of emulating nature in this way can be surprisingly effective , often solving difficult engineering and other design problems . However , as a human inventor who routinely uses these techniques , I can report that I continue to feel that I am still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of yet more powerful tools . <P> A TIME LINE <P> So when will this feeling of apparent control change ? When will we regard machine intelligence as the true originator of something creative ?
