Section : History Happened Here A sleepy Southwestern city that has exploded into a metropolis , Austin fights to retain the best of its past <p> A friend of mine who settled in austin about 30 years ago tells me it was really a small town then . " I knew the whole place . Geographically there was a core to it . " Ed Van de Vort , an Austin historian , agrees : " If you compare a pre-1910 photo of Congress Avenue with one taken in the late sixties , you would n't see much change . " <p> Today , the Texas capital is in many ways a thoroughly modern metropolis , with a population approaching one million and an architectural growth spurt that has allowed a bland , oversized skyline to claim prime territory along Town Lake , the dammed portion of the Colorado River that flows through the city center . Once they were built , those structures fell empty with the economic downturn of the 1980s . Everything has roared back , and the challenge for today 's Austin is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recent memory and the high-tech center it has become . " In our curmudge-only way we 'd like it to remain the small college town it used to be , " wrote the columnist Molly Ivins . <p> Despite the message beamed by its generic office buildings , the city enjoys a ripe and paradoxical culture of long standing . Home to a great university , a population of aging and newer-growth hippies , and some fabled , fiercely populist politicians , Austin is the fermenting , liberal center of its state and probably its region . <p> The relatively compact and very agreeable city center holds enough relics of the past to reveal a history that is long by Texas standards . From the earliest days , Congress Avenue , a northsouth road , formed the city 's heart . Austin was laid out in 1839 , and a census taken the following year shows 856 residents served by nine stores , nine saloons , six gambling houses , and numerous inns and stables . As the city developed , commerce , finance , and politics shaped Congress Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liquor lined up on the side streets . Most notable was Pecan , now called Sixth Street , then the dirt trail into town from the east . <p> In the late 1950s , when stores moved into strip malls on Austin 's outskirts , Sixth and its neighbors fell into a 10-year decline , reviving when people began to come downtown at night to enjoy the newly constituted live-music scene that has helped ensure the city 's continued vitality . Sixth Street was fortunate in its years of neglect since , as Ed Van de Wort points out , more than 60 percent of buildings that stood there before 1890 remain today . Much of the streetscape here is a collection of two- and three-story brick and limestone structures in which false fronted Western meets Gothic Revival . <p> Austin 's oldest-surviving building , the French Legation , dates from 1841 and is a reminder of the nine years ( 1836-45 ) that Texas was a republic . France , eager to corner the cotton market , recognized this upstart nation , and the legation 's first and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1839 . He bought 22 gently sloping acres , and by 1841 had completed a fancy white-columned residence . Now owned by the state and managed by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas , the house is open to the public and , thanks to its bucolic setting in the heart of town , the grounds are rented out for parties and weddings . <p> Sitting on twenty-two landscaped acres , Austin 's grandiose pink-granite capitol , completed in 1888 , is pungent with state pride . Its battles and leaders , the many countries whose flags flew here , and the Lone Star emblem all are recognized through an encrustation of paintings , photographs , statues , carvings , and mosaics . <p> Another reminder of the early days , the Texas General Land Office , dating from 1856-57 , resembles a Rhenish castle and is now a visitors ' center for the capitol complex of buildings . It is famous for one of its draftsmen , William Sidney Porter , better known as O. Henry . The author worked here for four years , starting in 1887 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he described as " isolated and somber ; standing apart from the other state buildings , sullen and decaying , brooding on the past . " <p> A cottage Porter and his family lived in for only two years has been restored as a museum . It has become a sort of shrine to foreign visitors , especially the Japanese , who study O. Henry in school and , says the curator , revere the short story form . <p> A block from the capitol grounds is the Governor 's Mansion , a fine Greek Revival structure from Austin 's first building boom of the 1850s , which is open to visitors . It radiates a special excitement these days , as the home of the presidential nominee George W. Bush . <p> It 's not so surprising that public buildings could survive in the downtown of a capital city , but the Bremond Block , a historic district a five-minute walk from the commercial center , is a true anomaly . Once part of a flourishing residential area , the only remaining block holds seven houses of fine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family for which the block is named . Austin 's Visitor Information Center provides , via an excellent brochure , a tour of the area plus a few neighboring Bremond family dwellings . <p> The opulent fabric that made up this part of town has been irrevocably torn , allowing these few houses , circled by ancient shade trees and deep gardens , to stand out in strong relief against the nearby parking garage , blankly modern bank , and abandoned lot . <p> Farther from the center , Austin is composed of leafy neighborhoods that have survived whole against change . Among many worth visiting is Hyde Park , which began life in the mid-1880s as the city 's first suburb . Its promoter , Martin Shipe , attracted new homeowners when he ran in a trolley line and created a park that contained a lake and a dance pavilion . A walk or drive through Hyde Park reveals a deeply rooted community that is a sampler of American domestic architecture . <p> Wherever you go in Austin , it is easy  --  almost mandatory  --  to connect with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 miles of hike-and-bike trails , lakes , creeks , and rivers , and , most famously , Barton Springs , a thousand-foot-long natural pool that might be called the city 's main square , attracting swimmers even in winter . In 1992 voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum to limit the development that threatened to pollute the Barton Springs watershed , and its defenders remain on alert . <p> Before Dell Computers and its like crowded into Austin , the city was defined by its two homegrown industries : politics and the ever-expanding University of Texas . There are many libraries and galleries worth a visit on the campus , none more rewarding than the LBJ Library and Museum , where , as Lyndon Johnson said at the building 's 1971 dedication , " It 's all here : the story of our time  --  with the bark off . " I went through the place nearly in tears , so strongly did it evoke the years that forged the man and the years that brought him down . In a 1948 letter to the family of a Mexican-American who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II and had been refused burial by their smalltown funeral parlor , Congressman Johnson writes , " I deeply regret that the prejudices of some individuals extend beyond life . I have no authority over civilian funeral homes but I have today made arrangements to have Pvt . Felix Longoria buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery . " <p> Johnson , we have recently learned , ran a tape recorder in the Oval Office . You can listen to a selection of his conversations , including one in which he discusses Vietnam with an adviser . " It 's not worth fighting for and you ca n't get out , " he says . " What is Laos to me ? " On another tape the President twists the arm of a congressman on behalf of Lady Bird : " I love that woman and she wants that highway beautification act and by God we 're going to get it for her ! " <p> An exhibit devoted to Lady Bird Johnson takes up nearly a whole floor at the museum , but as lively and informative as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public figure is more closely associated with preserving America 's natural environment than the former First Lady , whose devotion to the cause extends back to the days she and President Johnson occupied the White House . " We walked the problem of the environment onto center stage and put it on the national agenda , " she recalled . The local agenda , too , has benefited from Mrs. Johnson 's attention . She prevented the state 's highway department from mowing down wildflowers along highway medians and promoted the hike-and-bike trail that meanders along Town Lake . Perhaps most important , in 1982 she and the actress Helen Hayes founded the national Wildflower Research Center in Austin . <p> Thirteen years later and now bearing Mrs. Johnson 's name , the facility moved to a larger , 42-acre site on the eastern edge of the Hill Country that she and the President so dearly loved , adding another 136 acres in 1999 . <p> More than 400 species of native plants thrive here , and they draw to them many varieties of butterflies and birds . Darrel Morrison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of native vegetation wherever he works . " One of my crusades , " he says , " is for landscapes to express where they are so that people can see the differences . " <p> A striking feature of the center is the series of handsome cisterns , aqueducts , and storage tanks that create here one of the nation 's largest private water-collection systems . Offices and galleries are made of local materials and , in their careful use of tile and corrugated tin roofs or thick sandstone walls with wooden beams , suggest the architecture of the area 's early Spanish and German settlers . <p> " Wherever I go in America , " Lady Bird Johnson once said , " I like it when the land speaks its own language in its own regional accent . " Despite mammoth growth , Austin still manages to speak its own language , but it does n't hurt to have someone like Mrs. Johnson on hand to translate . TO PLAN A TRIP <p> Contact the Austin convention &; visitors bureau ( 800926-2282 or www.austintexas.org ) for lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tours . When you arrive in Austin , drop by the bureau to collect more of its sparkling and informative brochures such as the one on 101 Things to Do in Austin , and enjoy the large blowups of photos of Austin in the old days that decorate the walls . <p> I decided to stay at Austin 's historic Driskill Hotel because of its great location on Sixth , near Congress , and because I was looking forward to exploring its elaborate public rooms . It turned out that almost all the public space was undergoing a major restoration ( blase Austinites tell me the Driskill is always being redone ) , and among the jackhammers , dropcloths , and closed-off rooms , I had little sense of the place . A good lunch at the Four Seasons , which occupies a scenic riverfront location downtown , made me think that would have been the perfect choice . The Stephen E Austin Hotel , a 1920s structure on Congress Avenue , has been revamped recently and would also be well worth checking out . <p> Any season except the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but spring would be best if you 're interested in wildflowers in full flourish . There is a special number to call to find out when Texas bluebonnets , the state flower , are at their best : 800-452-9292 . Austin has a full calendar of events year-round . Probably the best known is the South by Southwest Music and Film Festival , held at various places around town in mid-March and consisting of more than 600 musical acts . Not surprisingly , the city is full to bursting for this one , so make plans well in advance . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Town Lake provides a respite from the economic burst of the last decade . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The balconied Driskill Hotel ( left ) thrives alongside other nineteenth-century buildings on East Sixth . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The observation tower at the Wildflower Research Center doubles as a water tank . <p> By Carla Davidson <p>
