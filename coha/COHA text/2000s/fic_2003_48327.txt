SHE SAW THEM RACING toward her as she pedaled south on Smithfield . Shirtless , gaunt , bloody , they cut across her oath in eerie silence - a flood of emaciated figures running through the empty Friday-evening streets of Pittsburgh . <p> One of them paused , sizing her up as the others blurred behind him . His lips clenched , revealing notched teeth in blackened gums . He seemed about to speak , but instead he turned , showing her the back of his head as he rejoined the stream of pumping legs and slapping feet . <p> Something protruded from the base of his skull . <p> She reached for her transmitter , pressed the talk button , and spoke into her headset . " Nix to dispatch . " <p> Nix was short for Double Nickels . Her other nicknames were Speed Limit and Speed . All but the last referred to her courier number : 55 . <p> The runners kept coming , churning past her like a river of dark flesh , darker wounds , and pitch-black eyes . <p> " Nix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bryan owned Hilltop Couriers , which he operated out of a renovated Mt . Washington home . He employed a staff of dispatchers during peak shifts . After hours , he ran things on his own . <p> " Dispatch . Go ahead , Nix . " <p> " Go to your window , Bryan . Look toward Smithfield . " <p> Bryan 's home sat on a bluff across the dark waters of the Monongahela . His office windows offered a panoramic view of the 800-acre patch of land that formed the western edge of the city - the triangular-shaped downtown known as the Golden Triangle . <p> " What 's going on , Nix ? " <p> The people kept running , funneling into the tight confines of Hobbs Way . <p> " Just look , Bryan ! " <p> She heard him getting up , breathing angrily into his headset as he crossed the room and panned his tripod-mounted binoculars . " What am I looking for , Nix ? " <p> The runners lost their definition as they spilled between the walls . They faded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Another beat , and they were gone . <p> " You missed it , Bryan . There were all these people . " <p> " People I can see anytime . " <p> " No . Not like these . They came out of nowhere . And they looked like - " She paused , realizing what he must be thinking . <p> " You feeling okay , Nix ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " You clean ? " <p> " You know I am . " <p> " Just checking . You 'd tell me , would n't you ? If you were sliding back - " <p> That 's when it hit . Silent thunder - a rumble that registered in Nix 's flesh but not her ears . Hairs bristled on her forearms . Prickles rose along her neck . In her bones , she felt the dissipating roar of something beyond sound .... <p> She knew the sensation . She had felt it before , had even researched it in that other life that she had been forced to put on hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nix braced herself as the tremors left her bones . A moment 's calm , and then the rumble came again . This time she was sure . The waves were coming from Hobbs Way . <p> " Nix ? You all right ? " Bryan could n't feel the concussions . His hilltop home put him well out of range . She considered what he must be thinking , looking down at her as she quaked silently against her handlebars . " Talk to me , Nix . " <p> The wave passed . She straightened up , cocked her foot against the pedal , and kicked off toward the source of the silent thunder . " Got ta check on something . " <p> Sirens wailed behind her , racing in from the east . <p> " Check what , Nix ? " His voice filled with static as she slipped into the high-walled alley . No colors here . Only the variegated grays of dusty asphalt and dusky shadows . <p> The emaciated figures stood in the thickening gloom , pressing together in the alley 's center : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it was then , as she reached for the switch on her helmet light , that the silent roar came again . And this time , Nix found herself at ground zero . <p> Her reflection hovered against the transparent side of a one-way window . She looked exhausted . Eyes like piss holes . Mouth a lipless line . Still , she looked better than the test subjects beyond the glass . <p> There were twelve of them . A half-dozen grad students , five laid-off flight attendants , and an out-of-work bank teller . Each would earn $300 for completing four days of testing . Between tests they could eat , watch DVDs , play cards , and take cold showers . What they could not do was sleep . <p> At the moment they were building Lego cars - four-wheeled rectangles that took five seconds to assemble . Each subject sat at a small table with two shoeboxes . The job involved taking a rectangular body from one box and wheels from the other . Four snaps and the finished car went into a pile beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose minds were fried from exhaustion . <p> Nix turned from the window , checking the digital graphics on her computer screens . The subjects all wore MEG caps that provided enhanced magnetoencephalographic images of their sleep-deprived brains . At the moment , the brains showed only light activity in their prefrontal cortices . Nix recognized the condition : Automatic Behavior Syndrome , the state when exhaustion knocks consciousness off-line , leaving the body to run on muscle memory and reflex . Nix had more than a professional relationship with the condition . During the last few months , she and ABS had become inseparable , bound fast by the demands of her daytime studies and nightlong research . <p> She checked the clock . Four twenty-eight A.M. The core team would n't arrive until 9:00 . She was on her own until then . Just herself , the subjects , ABS , and her new associates Bennie and Meth - stimulants that she truly believed she could handle . After all , if a psychology major could n't handle some substance use without letting it turn to abuse , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . She looked up to see one of the subjects , former bank teller Sara Woo , staring at the glass , making one-way eye contact from the mirror side of the window . Nix touched the intercom . " You all right , Sara ? Need a break ? " <p> Sara stared unresponsively . And then it hit , a silent rumble that moved through Nix like a vibrating wave . <p> She gripped the console as the test subjects fell against their workstations . They looked dazed , more confused than frightened . <p> " Everyone okay ? " Nix stood . " Stay in your seats . I 'm coming out . " <p> They just stared , gazing blankly at their reflections as Nix crossed to the booth 's door . She reached for the knob , but it slipped from her fingers as another blast threw her back into the tiny room . She tried catching the chair . The backrest swiveled . She went down , falling toward the video monitors , glimpsing screens where bursts of MEG light ignited like fire across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her field of view . A shaved second later , she was on the floor . <p> Only it was n't a floor . It was pavement . Grit shifted beneath her hands . She opened her eyes . Above her , walls tapered toward a darkening sky . Close to her ear , something hummed - a soft whirring , like a repeating whisper of wind . She turned toward it . <p> A few feet away , her bike lay on its side , its rear wheel spinning in empty air . <p> She remembered her test subjects : the grad students , the flight attendants , and bank teller . But that had been months ago . This time it had been emaciated runners in a narrow street . The fresher memory drifted before her as she stared into the darkness . She could still see the runners . It was as if their image had been burned onto her retinas , flashing back at her as she blinked her eyes . The image made no sense , but there it was . She saw them again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from her bike . And that was the part that made no sense . She blinked , watching again , seeing without comprehending : the runners had exploded . <p> To her left , something stirred : gritty footsteps approaching from Smithfield . She pulled herself up , looking toward the sound as a pair of flashlight beams converged on her face . Behind the beams , twin silhouettes stood backlit by a flashing cruiser . One of the silhouettes spoke . " You hurt ? " <p> She tried rising to her feet . <p> A second voice spoke , softer than the first . " Take it easy . " <p> Nix shielded her eyes . Two Pittsburgh cops coalesced between the beams . One officer was a man , the other a woman . Both were white . <p> " I 'm okay . " She stood . <p> The male officer asked , " What happened to you ? " <p> She considered what he saw when he looked at her : a dark-skinned woman in dirty spandex , dreadlocked hair , and fingerless gloves - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked , " What happened here ? " <p> " Not sure . " She felt it wise to avoid the whole truth . Mention of a silently exploding mob would only complicate things . In a world preoccupied with terrorist strikes , it was best to keep things simple . " I was just riding . Then I was on the ground . " <p> " There 've been reports of explosions . Hear anything ? " <p> " No . " That much was true . <p> " Can I see some identification ? " <p> She dug in her wallet , hunting her courier ID , but coming out instead with her expired card from the University of Pittsburgh . <p> The cop put his flashlight on the card , pronouncing her name as if it were a nervous sigh : " Gati . " He turned the light back onto her face . " What kind of name 's Gati ? " <p> " Indian . " She looked right at the light , refusing to squint . <p> " What kind of Indian ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India ? " <p> " No . Pleasant Hills . My mother 's parents were from Bombay . " <p> " So that makes you what ? " <p> " American . " She did n't have time for this . She turned to the female officer . " Can I go ? " <p> The male officer lowered his flashlight , looking again at the ID . " You a student ? " <p> " Was . " <p> " Now you 're a courier . " <p> " Yeah . " It hurt to hear the struggle reduced to such simple terms . " Now I 'm a courier . " <p> " I need to see that courier ID , " the officer said . <p> She looked again , digging through the crap that had accumulated in her tiny wallet : bankcard receipts , maxed-out Visa , Social Security number .... " Here it is . " She pulled out her photo card . <p> The officer studied it . " What were you doing in this alley ? " <p> " Cutting through . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice : " Nix ! Location ! " <p> To the cops , Nix said , " Excuse me . Got ta check in . " She hit the stud on her transmitter . " Nix here . Hobbs Way . " <p> " Damnit , Nix ! What 's going on down there ? " <p> The male officer said , " That Bryan Cole ? " <p> Nix nodded . <p> The officer 's face lost its edge . He returned her ID and said , " Tell him you 're heading back . " <p> She pressed her talk stud . " I 'm heading back , Bryan . Police escort . " <p> " What 's going on , Nix ? " <p> " Could n't tell you . " <p> " You got ta know something . Downtown 's been filling with cops since you ducked into that alley . " <p> " Like I said , Bryan , I do n't know anything . " She raised her bike from the pavement and followed the cops toward the end of the alley . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a driver . He 's got a package going downtown , but the cops wo n't let him cross the bridge . He wants to know if we can - ? " <p> She tugged the jack from the transmitter as she stepped toward the red-blue-red-blue glare of Smithfield Street . Bryan hated when she disconnected the headset , but she had enough going on in her brain without his voice adding to the commotion . <p> " We 're sealing off downtown , " the female officer said . " Everything west of Smithfield . " <p> They stepped out into the strobing lights . Two vans had pulled across the entrance to the Smithfield Street Bridge . Other vehicles blocked the major intersections between Port Pitt Boulevard and Liberty Avenue . <p> The female officer said , " Bomb squad 's on its way . No one 's found any damage , but we 're not taking chances . We 're asking people to leave the area or stay indoors . " <p> Nix cocked her foot against a raised pedal . " For how long ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors in the flashing light . " Till someone figures out what 's going on . " <p> NIX STOOD in the back of the booth while the core team studied the playbacks . On the video screen , test subjects gripped their workstations , holding tight as if the floor were shifting beneath them . <p> Above the video screens , MEG displays showed a dozen brains glowing with hyperactive yellows and reds . <p> Dr. Qualin turned , looking at Nix . " Can you remember anything else ... anything that is n't on the tapes ? " <p> " Just what I said . Two tremors . One mild . One strong enough to knock me down . " <p> Qualin looked skeptical . He turned back to the monitors . " Let 's rewind to where Gati asks Sara if there 's something wrong . " He spoke softly , without accusation , but Nix sensed his suspicion . Something had triggered the group reaction . Qualin seemed to think it was something she had done . <p> Nix turned , left the booth , and slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their washroom . The subjects were gone now , sleeping like corpses in the recovery area . Nix envied them . <p> Three sinks stood against a mirrored wall . She walked to the center basin and wrenched the handles . Water clattered from the spigot . She leaned forward , thrusting her hands into the stream . The cold felt good . She splashed her face , holding her eyes open as the water broke across her cheeks . She had a class in less than an hour , and already she was crashing . <p> She leaned forward , looking at her piss-hole eyes while the door opened behind her . A concerned face looked in . It was Ellen Slater , her academic adviser , Qualin 's research partner . " All right , girl ? " <p> Nix tugged a handful of towels from the dispenser . " Nothing a week of sleep wo n't cure . " She wiped her face . <p> Ellen moved closer . " Just so you know , Dr. Qualin 's not pissed at you . It 's the grant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said it was certain to be renewed . " <p> " That was last month . It 's a new world , Nix . We all need to be thinking military research . That 's where the money 's going , armed forces and homeland security . " <p> The water in the sink grew warmer . Mist rose , fogging the mirror , softening Ellen 's reflection as she leaned close . " You look exhausted , girl . " <p> Nix shrugged . Exhaustion did n't matter . " Those tremors were real , Ellen . " She turned off the water . " I did n't fall because I was tired . Something knocked me down . " <p> Ellen gave Nix 's shoulder a reassuring squeeze before backing away . " Go home , Nix . Get some sleep . Check your e-mail . " <p> " My e-mail ? " <p> " I 'll send you something . " <p> " Something like what ? " <p> Ellen turned toward the door . " Something that can wait till you 're rested . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . I 'll send you something . We 'll talk tomorrow . " And then she was gone , leaving Nix leaning against the basin , torn between work and the sleep that threatened to swallow her whole . <p> She turned the water back on , just the cold this time . Her class started at 10:00 . She reached into her pocket . The pills were there . <p> She cupped a hand under the spigot . <p> *** <p> Nix found Bryan by an office window , looking at the downtown streets through high-powered binoculars . " You unplugged your headset . " He spoke without turning . " I hate when you do that . " <p> " Sorry . I had enough to deal with . " <p> " And now you got more . " <p> " Meaning ? " <p> " That package . " He pointed without turning . " It 's on the desk . " <p> " I did n't say I 'd deliver it , Bryan . " <p> " You did n't say you would n't . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " <p> " The bridges are closed , Bryan . " <p> " Which is why it has to be you making the delivery . " <p> Nix crossed the room , her knees still warm from muscle burn , her shoulders aching from the uphill climb out of the city . Usually she hitched rides by grabbing the fenders of outbound cars , but tonight the traffic had been light , made up of vehicles being turned away at the bridge barricade . All had raced by at full throttle , too fast to catch . <p> At least the muscle burn felt good . It was healthy pain , more bearable than the ache that lingered from hitting the pavement in Hobbs Way . Her shoulder spasmed as she crossed to the desk and picked up the package : cylindrical , fifteen inches tall , six inches around , wrapped in insulated Tyvek . It felt heavy and cold . <p> Bryan said , " The driver said he 'd make it worth your while . " <p> " How much does he think my while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stuffed the package into her bag . Then she rounded his desk to stand beside him at the window . Across the river , intersections flashed with the lights of idling cruisers . Between the intersections , empty streets angled toward the city 's western edge . <p> Bryan tapped the glass . " TV says the tremors were all west of Smithfield . Lots of people felt them . No one saw a thing . " <p> Nix flexed her shoulders , reserving comment . <p> " And there 's no damage . " Bryan turned from the window . " This doctor on Channel Four thinks it 's group hysteria , but the cops are n't taking any chances . " His face caught the glow from his desk lamp as he leaned back against the glass . Spider veins limned his cheeks and nose . Dark circles rimmed his eyes . He looked tired . " I would n't ask you to do this if I thought there was - " He hesitated . " If I thought there was some kind of incident going on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of nylon and spandex , the package felt cold against her shoulders . " So where 's this package going ? " <p> " Riverfront Hotel . " <p> " Does n't get much more ' downtown ' than that . What 's the suite number ? " <p> " No suite . " <p> " The room , then . " <p> " No room . The client 's renting the twenty-second floor . The night manager will take you up . " <p> " What kind of man rents an entire floor ? " <p> " A rich man . " Bryan walked with her to the office door . " His name 's Summit . First initial A. Middle initial J. " <p> " A.J. Summit . " The name rang of self-importance . It also seemed faintly familiar : not a name that she knew , but the echo of one . <p> " Been living at the Riverfront for two weeks . I hear he had the space remodeled to some weird specifications . " <p> " How weird ? " <p> " Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remodeled an entire floor ? " <p> " Like I said , he 's rich . " <p> She glanced back at Bryan 's office windows , toward the glowing hotel that stood on the city 's western edge . The twenty-second floor was totally dark . She asked , " Did you inspect the package ? If I get stopped , I 'll be in enough trouble for just being in the city . I do n't want to get busted for carrying contraband . " <p> " It 's nothing illegal , Nix . " <p> She knew better than to question him further . Bryan lived by the dictum that a courier 's concerns ended with where and when . Everything else was between management and client . <p> Bryan said , " The driver 's already covered the delivery charges . Mr. Summit will pay you the rest in cash if you reach him by 9:00 . " <p> She checked her watch : 8:20 . " Forty minutes to enter and cross a curfewed city ? " <p> " You can do it . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? I nearly killed myself last time . " <p> " I 'm not telling you how to get there . " He turned back toward the window . " The package is due at the Riverfront by 9:00 . The extra cash and how you collect it are your business . " <p> Ellen 's e-mail came with a single line and a 14,860 KB attachment . The line read : " There might be a thesis here . " The attachment was titled " Alpha Tremors . " <p> Nix started the download and then climbed into a hot shower . The water did n't calm her . She had reached the plateau of dull anxiety - a terrible state that stretched between chemical high and physical crash . She wished now that she had taken Ellen 's advice about skipping the day 's lectures . <p> She left the shower and returned to her computer . The attached document turned out to be a series of magazine and newspaper articles . Most of the datelines were from third-world countries : Malaysia , Indonesia , Pakistan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweatshops . <p> A picture scrolled into view . She took her finger from the arrow key , reading the headline above the digitized photo : " Work Continues as Workers Shake . " <p> The photo showed a cavernous room packed with hunched children and ancient sewing machines . Cables dangled from a low ceiling . Bolts of fabric leaned against windowless walls . One of the workers grinned , revealing notched teeth that looked as if they were used for cutting thread . The caption read : Sweatshop workers brace against phantom tremors in Bhiwandi , India . She clicked a hyperlink , accessing an additional note : <p> Tremors may originate in a nearby factory . Bhiwandi is the suspected home to at least one non-sleep shop . <p> The words shimmered . She rubbed her eyes and read them again , making sure . What the hell was a " non-sleep shop " ? <p> She scrolled on , skimming the text , pausing at the photos . Many of the articles were from human rights publications . Most were in English . A few were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these were partially translated in hyperlinks . She paused to reread one of them : <p> The tremors are not earthquake related . Although reports in India were attributed to movement in the Kachchh Fault , what can we make of similar phenomena in non-seismic zones such as Malaysia ? <p> She kept scrolling , reading with waning comprehension until the string of documents ended with a grainy , underexposed photograph . <p> She leaned forward , trying to focus . The image showed workers hunched over massive machines . One of the workers had his back to the camera . Something huge protruded from the base of his skull . The caption was in Chinese . She clicked the hyperlink translation : <p> Photo purportedly taken in a non-sleep shop in the garment district of Zhongshan , China . <p> BRYAN 'S HOME VANISHED in her rearview as she steered onto a sloping side street . Her return trip would avoid the main arteries that led up the side of Mt . Washington . Instead , she would stick to neighborhood streets and alleys that had been paved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a thirty-percent slope , past houses that all had first-and second-floor doors , she caught a glimpse of the south-shore valley and the old J &L; Bridge . The span , once used for hauling hot metal , had been partially dismantled . Now it was little more than I-beams atop a corroded truss . She had ridden it before , but she 'd been high on crystal meth . Could she ride it again , stone sober , powered by endorphins ? She 'd know soon enough . <p> The hillside alleys leveled toward the Southside 's main arteries . She headed northeast , through the bright lights of Carson Street , angling into the narrow streets that had once been home to Europe 's hungry and poor - exploited workers who had labored twelve-hour shifts at ten cents an hour . Her paternal grandfather , a blind Irishman who 'd lost one leg to the mill and the other to diabetes , had told her stories passed down from his father - epic nightmares of life in a lidless hell . <p> She cut down a cobble lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . Seconds later she emerged along the northern edge of a dismantled foundry - the ghost of a mill that had once stretched for 276 acres along both sides of the Monongahela . She veered left , toward a chain-link fence and a ragged hole large enough to accommodate a bike . She hunkered down and coasted through . Up ahead , the sooty walls of the old mill blocked her view of the river . Just as well . She did n't want to see the I-beams until she was on them . See them too soon and she might turn back .... <p> Bryan 's voice crackled in her headset . " See you , Nix . Looking good . " <p> She kept pedaling , heading toward a gap in a boarded doorway . Through the opening-beyond a stretch of industrial darkness-another door opened toward a band of river lights . <p> " You 're making good time , Nix . Keep this up , you 'll be there before " The headset filled with static as she entered the gutted mill . She knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something wrong with the darkness . <p> Beyond the glow of her headlamp , clotting shadows became bowed shoulders and withered hands : Shapes coalesced , forming rows of chugging machines , stretching deep in all directions , surrounding her with specters of industrial slavery . But these were not the enslaved immigrants of Pittsburgh industry . These ghosts were not making steel .... <p> Pulsing needles thundered in the thinning darkness . She saw ancient sewing machines and workers in sandals and loose-fitting pants . And behind each bent figure , dangling from a hook on a metal pole , a bag of milky fluid dripped into a transparent tube . <p> She found herself focusing on an androgynous reed with bare breasts and close-cropped hair . It was a tiny man , bent and wasted . The feeding tube slipped over his shoulder and into a crusted shunt beneath a protruding clavicle . He was being fed intravenously . <p> On his head , he wore an elastic band that sagged behind his ears . And as he turned to drop a finished sleeve into a bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his skull . Cradled in elastic and Velcro , this implant was larger and heavier than the one in his chest . Vapor condensed on its metal skin . A steel nipple extended from its base , connecting to a tube that ran into a pump box beside his chair . From the box , a second tube extended back to the base of the worker 's skull . <p> She saw all of these things in an instant , absorbing them in a glance that ended when she noticed a calibrated panel in the pump box 's side . Behind the panel , fluid collected in a graduated cylinder . It held her gaze . She could n't look away . She felt herself falling .... <p> WHAM ! <p> She flew through an open doorway and hurtled toward a line of river lights . The wind felt unreal against her face . Where was she ? <p> She landed and skidded on weedy gravel . Dust climbed around her shoes as she stopped and looked back . Inside the foundry , shadows fell from concrete pillars , crisscrossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into empty darkness . No emaciated workers . No drumming needles . No dripping tubes . <p> " Nix ! Something wrong ? " <p> Bryan 's voice brought her back to the real . She reached for her transmitter . " Taking a breather . " She had no desire to share the hallucination . " Everything 's fine . " Her therapists had warned her about flashbacks . Was that what she had just ridden though ? A flashback ? The belated effect of having spent too many amphetamine nights staring at photos of block-long sweatshops and researching the stats of enslaved lives ? <p> " Clock 's ticking , Nix . " <p> She reoriented herself , feeling the wind on her face , the rubber grips against her palms , the dirt beneath her shoes . No time to puzzle over the ghosts of past addictions . No time for anything but riding . " Right ! " She turned her bike and pushed off , steering onto the riprap at the base of the Hot Metal tracks . Then , with pedal-strapped shoes and bar-gripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopped over a discarded rail , and landed on the back of an I-beam . <p> " I see you , Nix . Looking good . " <p> Coasting , holding the handle steady with one hand , she reached for the transmitter and disengaged the headset . She did not need Bryan distracting her . This ride was between her and the bridge .... <p> She remembered the last time she had ridden the span . It had been the middle of a sleepless week , forty hours after disillusionment over her thesis had forced her out of school , five days before drug abuse had landed her in rehab . On that night there had been enough crystal meth in her veins to power a small borough , and Bryan 's office had been full of couriers - all watching in amazement as she rode the beam . <p> But now she rode on cool nerves , following her helmet beam as it raced along the elevated strip of iron . The trick was to concentrate on moving ahead-not worrying about where she was , but concentrating on where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clear vision kept her focused on the light . Controlled effort propelled her forward . <p> As the span ended , she braked and pivoted onto an eroded slope that angled along the bridge abutment . Her body flowed with the maneuvering bike - in balance , in control . <p> Ellen gave her the news over coffee in a Forbes Avenue Starbucks . It was official . The grant would not be renewed . " Your stipend runs through December , Nix . You can use the time to start your thesis . " <p> " A thesis on alpha blasts ? " <p> " Maybe . But do n't call them alpha blasts . That would n't go over . " <p> " What do I call them ? " <p> " Nothing yet . But you and the test subjects felt something . You 've got access to their exit interviews , the videos , the MEG scans . And there 's your personal impressions . Something happened , and you felt it . If you can document it , you might encourage further inquiry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those documents I sent you were collected by a technician who spent eleven months doing peptide research in a Hong Kong lab . She left when she realized the applications for what she was doing . " <p> " What was she doing ? " <p> " Developing a process to inhibit sleep . " <p> " Sounds like a noble cause . " <p> " Until you consider the application . " <p> Nix remembered the blurred photo from Zhongshan , China . " Non-sleep sweatshops ? " <p> Ellen nodded . " Labor is a shop 's least efficient component . Machines do n't tire . Factories and warehouses do n't close . Only people need time off to recharge . " <p> " You think that 's a good thing , biological downtime ? " <p> " It 's a natural thing . " <p> " So is hunting and gathering , but who does that ? " Nix eased back from the table , turning toward the stream of morning traffic beyond the cafe windows . Her bike sat by the door , waiting to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Couriers . If she got the job , there was a chance she could afford to stay in school once her stipend ran out . " Funny thing , " she said , staring into the angled light . " I used to ride for fun . Cross-country . BMX . No time for that now . " She looked back at Ellen . " Now everything 's work . " <p> " Should n't be that way . " <p> " But it is . " She studied Ellen 's face , trying to read between the gentle lines . The woman had mastered the aspect of a clinical psychologist , but beneath the detachment Nix detected a stratum of guarded caution . <p> " Listen , Nix . What if lack of sleep posed a danger , not just to the people who did n't sleep , but to the people around them as well ? " <p> " That 's nothing new . ABS causes - " <p> " I 'm not talking about sleeping drivers . " Ellen leaned forward . " What if the tremors you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more disruptive phenomenon ? " <p> " Disruptive where ? Egypt ? Malaysia ? Who 's going to care about that ? You said it yourself , Ellen . The world 's changed . No one cares about workers ' rights , and alpha blasts are n't exactly the third-world disturbances that are making news these days . " <p> " If the proof existed , people might listen . " <p> " Maybe . But would they be the right people ? " <p> " Who are the right people , Nix ? " <p> " The people in a position to affect change . Shop owners , for example . What do they care about tremors if they 've got a maximized workforce ? And the workers , what about them ? More job time means more income . They 're not going to give that up . I know I would n't . " <p> Ellen did n't answer right away . For a moment she sat , digesting the words , looking thoughtful . Her days of wild hypotheses and recklessinvestigation were behind her . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she wanted to . And despite the forced calm of her face , her eyes made it clear that she wanted to . At last , she said . " It 's a thesis topic , Nix . You could do worse . " <p> " I 'll think it over . " <p> " Do . " <p> Nix started to stand , paused when Ellen seemed ready to say something more . But the moment passed in silence , with only a soft change in the woman 's expression . It was a subtle change , but Nix caught it . And with it she glimpsed the truth beneath the surface . Intuitively , Nix realized that the Hong Kong technician had not been one of Ellen 's associates . " All right , " Nix said . " I 'll think it over . I 'll let you know . " <p> The technician had been Ellen . <p> THE WHARF STRETCHED beneath rusting trestles , following the curve of the river toward a pedestrian tunnel that had long ago become home to a tribe of hardcore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usually they let her pass without comment . Tonight , however , they were gone-either routed by cops , or ( more likely ) watching from the city 's shadows while the police puzzled over phantom tremors . Their cardboard beds and trash-bagged possessions flashed in her headlamp 's glow as she pedaled on . <p> Up ahead , a red-and-blue haze spilled across the tunnel 's end . The police were out there , positioned on Commonwealth Place . But even if they looked toward the tunnel , what would they see ? A blur of shadow ? A silent streak vanishing into the dark expanse of Point State Park ? If they called to her , she would keep moving . If they gave chase , she would lose them on secret trails that diverged from the paved walkways . And if they caught her , she would be no worse off than if she hid in the tunnel and waited for a better plan . She had eight minutes to get to A. J. Summit . She had to keep moving . <p> Pedaling furiously , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashed through a curtain of broken shrubs . She shifted to a power gear , jumped a ditch of muddy runoff , and coasted up a wedge of gritty earth . <p> Another wall of shrubs blocked her path . She braced , stayed the course , and crashed through onto a sloping berm . Almost there . The hotel 's west face loomed before her . <p> Ellen looked up as Nix blew into her office . <p> " I 've got like five minutes . " Nix threw her helmet on the floor and slumped into a chair . " What did you think ? " The tiny office filled with a soft metronomic tapping - muffled beats like pulsing pistons . " Did you get my first draft ? Did you read it ? " <p> Ellen turned from her computer screen . " Yes . " She looked concerned . " I read it . " <p> " And ? " <p> " Honestly ? " <p> Nix sat forward . " Christ ! " The tapping grew louder . " You did n't like it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen set her glasses on the desk . " The draft is promising . Some good analysis of the MEG data . Nice handling of the exit interviews .... " <p> " So what 's the problem ? " <p> Again , she asked , " Honestly ? " <p> " Yeah . " Nix glanced at her watch . " I 've got like four minutes . Hit me . " <p> " All right , Nix . " Ellen paused . For a moment , she too seemed to be listening to the phantom tapping . " No bullshit , Nix . I 'll give it to you straight . You look like hell . " <p> " Me ? " <p> " What do you weigh ? Ninety pounds ? " <p> " Ninety-six . " <p> " That 's what , ten percent underweight ? " <p> " I 'm small-boned . " <p> " You 're five-eight , Nix . And you 're losing muscle . " <p> " I 'm riding full time . How can I be - ? " <p> " Still taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . <p> " I thought we were going to talk about my thesis . " <p> " We did , Nix . It 's a good start , but you 'll never finish it if you keep wearing yourself down . " <p> Nix looked at her watch . <p> " What 's going on , Nix ? Where do you have to be that 's so important ? " <p> " Work . " <p> " Your shift 's over . " <p> " First one 's over . I 'm doing a second . Just for today , to cover the rent . " She picked up her helmet . " Tell you what , can you e-mail me ? Tell me what I need to do - with the thesis , I mean . Just the thesis . Tell me . I 'll do it . " She stood . The thumping stopped . She looked down . The sound had been coming from her feet : Automatic Behavior Syndrome . She had left the bike outside , but her feet had kept on riding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she locked her bike in the shadow of a dumpster . Then she rounded the building 's southwest corner and stepped out into the blazing headlights of three idling busses . People climbed aboard , looking tired and anxious as bell-hops loaded their bags . What did this mean ? Was the hotel being evacuated ? <p> She pushed through the crowd and into the lobby . <p> At the main desk , the night manager spoke into a telephone , the receiver wedged between his ear and shoulder . He sorted receipts as he worked the phone : two tasks at once , the bane of frontline management . <p> The clock behind him gave a muffled tick : 8:55 . <p> She stepped toward the desk . " Hey ! " She slapped the counter with her gloved palm . " Hilltop Couriers . " <p> He looked up . His eyes had the same red-rimmed glare that she often saw in Bryan 's . To the phone , he said , " One moment . " Then , to Nix : " Excuse me ? " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pack thumped the desk . " Delivery for Mr. Summit . " <p> His brow buckled . " Delivery ? " <p> " For A. J. Summit . " She glanced toward the busses . " He still here ? My dispatcher said you 'd show me up . " <p> Again , to the phone : " Right back . " He stabbed the hold button and dropped the receiver . " Sorry . " He brushed a hand against his high forehead , straightening the memory of a forelock . " Ca n't take you up , but I can show you the way . " He turned and took a set of keys from the wall behind him . " Follow me . " He swung the keys around his thumb , catching them in his palm . " I thought downtown was closed to incoming traffic . " He looked back at her as he walked . " It been reopened ? " <p> " No . " Her tone let him know that she did n't want to go into it . <p> He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed a key into a battered panel . The grate opened . " It 's the only way to get to twenty-two . Other than the stairs , of course . And you would n't want to take them . " <p> She stepped inside as he pulled the key from the panel . " The regular elevators will bring you back down . They just do n't carry passengers up there . You know . For privacy . " <p> The grate closed . He spoke to her through the bars . " I 'd take you up , but I ca n't leave my post . We 're moving some guests uptown , out of the curfew area . Right now it 's voluntary , but the cops say everyone 's got to go if those rumbles start again . " He swung the keys . " You might mention that to Mr. Summit . He wo n't like being moved , but if the cops insist - " <p> " I 'll tell him . " She looked at the rows of buttons on the elevator wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the button for twenty-two ? " <p> " That 's it . " <p> She hit the button . <p> The elevator lurched and started to move . <p> Subj:Your Thesis <p> Date:1/17/02 <p> From:Dr . Ellen Slater &lt;eslater&gt; <p> To:Gati Imbel &lt;nix55&gt; <p> Nix : <p> Attached document contains my comments . As I said , you 've produced a good first draft , a respectable start , but I 'm concerned about your lack of support for the existence of non-sleep sweatshops . More problematic , your so-called " dream solution " ( top management becoming concerned with the health and well-being of low-level workers ) is unrealistic . You said it yourself a few months ago . Those who can affect change need a compelling reason to listen . Without one , I 'm afraid the concluding argument breaks down . A thesis is no place for " dream solutions . " <p> SHE TRIED reconnecting her headset as the clattering cables pulled her upward , but to her surprise the jack was still in the transmitter . A broken wire dangled from its end . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when all she 'd meant to do was pull the plug . Bryan was going to be pissed . <p> She removed her helmet , then the headset . The latter was merely an earplug and a pinhead mic , held in place with a Velcro band . She wrapped the broken wire around the Velcro and dropped the unit into her helmet . <p> The floors scrolled by , rolling like an image on a badly tuned monitor : a succession of door-lined halls , then a utility floor of steel beams and humming compressors , then eleven more floors of rooms until the car emerged into a foyer smelling of fresh paint and plaster . <p> The grate opened . Nix pressed the button to send the car back down . Then she stepped out , advancing toward a wood-veneer door . <p> Near the ceiling , a camera glared with an LED eye . To its left , a voice buzzed from a half-inch speaker . " You 're the courier ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> The elevator clattered behind her , slipping away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was missing from the foyer . <p> The night manager had told her to use one of the regular elevators when she wanted to leave . But there were no such elevators here . There was only the service elevator 's grate-covered shaft , the wood-veneer door , the camera , the speaker , and the buzzing voice : " You have my package ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> The door clicked , disengaging from its frame . <p> She pushed inward . Squinting as intense light spilled from the room . <p> Again , the voice spoke , coming to her first through the speaker , and then , a quarter second later , from somewhere deep within the light : " Hurry . " ( " Hurry . " ) <p> The entire level had been gutted , walls and fixtures carted away until all that remained was an orchard of widely spaced pipes and beams - all illuminated by a powerful glow . <p> Across the space , dwarfed by distance , a man leaned before a fluorescent wall . He seemed strangely deformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beside him , stretching across a raised iridescent plane , stood a line of puzzling objects : a rhombic rectangle , a suspended teardrop , and an empty fishbowl balanced atop a glass pedestal . The tableau resembled something from a Richard Powers painting - futuristic images from the mid-twentieth century . <p> Nix stepped onto the raised floor , a grid of Plexiglas panels illuminated from below . The ceiling was much the same . And so were the walls : rows of fluorescent tubes behind translucent sheets . All the windows had been covered , blocking out the night , holding in the glare . " You A. J. Summit ? " <p> " I am . " <p> The room extended for nearly a city block - 400 feet of glowing void . <p> She moved forward , advancing between the exposed pipes and beams . Deprived of their shadows , they resembled paper cutouts - two-dimensional artifacts against a blinding backdrop . <p> Mr. Summit condensed from the glow as she moved toward him . She saw that his misshapen shoulders were actually the lumpy folds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown to chin , held a face that was at once agitated and exhausted . Like the pipes and beams , his robe-draped body cast no shadow - nor did the few necessities that stood behind him : a white cot , a silver footlocker , and a sink and commode that grew like porcelain tubers from tangled pipes . Forty feet beyond the fixtures , white walls formed a floor-to-ceiling partition large enough to hold a stairwell and a bank of elevators . An oblong seam intimated the presence of a door . <p> Summit stepped forward , gesturing toward her bag . " Is that my package ? " He spoke with the precise accent of an Oxford don , but there was also a lilting hesitance , as if the English had been acquired as a second language . <p> She tugged the zipper and removed the cylinder . " And I was told you 'd have something for me . " <p> " It is there . " He pointed to the iridescent plane that stretched beside him . She saw now that it was a transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved to be a wafer-thin computer screen , a crystal decanter , and a brandy snifter . And there was a fourth object - an envelope with an open flap . <p> " The envelope is yours . " He reached toward her . " And that cylinder is mine . " His fingers brushed hers as he took the package . His hands felt cold , wet . They trembled . She knew the symptoms . Junkie hands . <p> She put her helmet on the table and picked up the envelope . She looked inside . The first bill was a hundred . So was the one under it . She ran her thumb along the edges . Ten bills . " There 's a thousand dollars here . " <p> " Yes . " He drew a delicate knife from the pocket of his robe . " Is that a problem ? " <p> " It 's more than I expected . " <p> " Then you will stay . " It was n't a question . <p> " Stay ? " <p> " To help . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist rose from the incision . He peeled back the lid , looked inside , then placed the package on the desk . His hands trembled . " You must help me . " He pushed it toward her , the top now cut away . Something shone within . " I am not able to do it . " He raised his hands - withered , trembling . " Take it out for me . Please . " <p> She folded the thousand-dollar envelope and slipped it into her bag . Then she stepped forward , reached into the package , and lifted out a stainless-steel cylinder . Moisture beaded on its sides , collecting around her fingers as she set it on the table . <p> " Dispose of that , please . " He pointed to the empty package . " I do not like clutter . " <p> She crumpled the insulated Tyvek and stuffed it into her bag . <p> " And now this . " He turned to the stainless-steel cylinder . " Open it , please . " He slipped into a padded chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gripped the stainless-steel lid , twisting till it came loose in a jet of dark mist . <p> " And pour it , please . " He pushed a trembling hand toward the crystal decanter . " You must pour it into here . It needs to warm before I can drink it . " <p> She set the lid on the table . A corona of mist formed at its base , spreading in white rays across the Lucite . <p> " But carefully , please . It must n't be agitated once it is open . " <p> A black stream slipped from the cylinder as she tilted it toward the decanter . The stream fell silently , fanning as it struck the crystal bottom . <p> " I usually have my attendant pour it . He took my car to the airport , to pick up the package . When he tried to return , the police would not let him back into the city . " <p> She barely heard him . Her attention was on the decanter and the black thread that poured through its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it looked like falling sand - fine as onyx dust . But mostly it looked like nothing , a void , a gap in the physical world . She felt herself falling , as if the negative space within the crystal were compounding her exhaustion . <p> " Careful ! You are spilling it ! " <p> She straightened up . Before her , a teaspoon of blackness turned to vapor on the Lucite . " Sorry . " The cylinder gave a hollow thump as she returned it to the table . " I 'll wipe it up . " <p> " No . Let it go . It evaporates quickly . " He pointed to the snifter while the spilled blackness vanished into thready mist . " Pour some into there . " <p> She raised the decanter , held it to the glass , and poured three fingers of icy void . Vapor rose , filling the snifter 's bowl . <p> " Bring it to me . " <p> The front of his monitor came into view as she rounded the desk . A pinhead microphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Below them , a flat screen glowed with colors undimmed by the surrounding glare . She realized that she was looking at a piece of high-end technology - a wafer-thin screen of incredible brilliance . Upon its surface , images stood stacked like comic-book panels . One frame held a grid of touch-activated icons . Another showed the empty foyer that she had passed through moments before . Each of the others displayed live-action video , rectangles crammed with emaciated workers and pounding machines . <p> He took the snifter from her hand , cupping it in his palms as she stared at the screen . <p> " These people . " She pointed toward the video images . Fitted with shunts , feeding tubes , and catheters , each figure resembled the blurred silhouette from Zhongshan , China . They also recalled the specters she had seen while pedaling through the Southside foundry . <p> At the base of each shaved head , a large implant lay cradled in a nest of Velcroed elastic . " Are they working for you ? " <p> He did n't answer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His features looked faintly Indian . She considered his name : A. J. Summit . She had known many Indians who adjusted their names , modifying pronunciation and spelling to appeal to western ears and eyes . Sandhya became Sandy . Samir became Sam . Neelish became Neil . Those with names like Gati had to be more creative , but the practice was common enough to make her doubt the authenticity of A. J. Summit . <p> What if the initials were n't initials ? Not A. J. , but Ajay . And what of the last name ? Lose an m and you had Sumit . She knew that name . Ajay Sumit . She had seen it while researching fabrication plants in western India .... <p> She asked the question again . " These people ... are they working in your factories ? " <p> " Yes . " He pressed the snifter to his chest , steadying his hands as they warmed the drink . " They must look ghastly to you - all those tubes . But the procedure is actually a good thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his income . " He lowered his face , pressing his nose to the vapor that gathered below the snifter 's rim . He inhaled . The mist rose , swirling into his nostrils . <p> She watched him , realizing that she was standing before the Holy Grail of her abandoned thesis . Ajay Sumit , the shadowy presence behind a propagation of non-sleep sweatshops . <p> Her heart knotted . " Those IV tubes . " She winced , feeling the anxious exhaustion from halfway around the world . " You 're giving these people drugs to keep them awake . " <p> " No . Not giving . Removing . Those tubes are extracting peptides . Endogenous narcotics . The chemicals of natural sleep . They can be separated from the blood and spinal fluid . Someday , we hope to market them - make them available to people who can afford to savor the luxury of organic oblivion . " Again , he put his face to the snifter , but this time he did n't inhale the vapor . This time he pressed his lips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid . <p> She watched in disgust as he lowered the glass . <p> His lips trembled , turning blue around his misting breath . " Our chemists have n't perfected the liqueur . There are problems . They 've advised me not to drink it , but it 's the only way I can sleep . " He pushed the snifter into her hand . " More , please . " <p> She backed away . <p> " Please . I need another . " <p> She returned the snifter to the table . " I want no part of this . " <p> " I 've paid you . " <p> " Some things do n't have a price . " <p> " Everything has a price ! " He gripped the sides of his chair , composing himself as he held her gaze . " The workers have agreed to the procedure . They embrace it . " He glanced at the screen . " They stay on for days ... weeks at a time . " <p> " I imagine you have quite a waiting list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Yes . It 's a terrific windfall . " <p> " For whom ? " <p> " Everyone . Management gets a maximized workforce . Labor gets a living wage . " <p> " And sleep becomes a value-added byproduct ? " <p> " No . Not yet . It 's still in development . I should n't have started drinking it . Now I ca n't stop . " <p> " Ca n't or wo n't ? " <p> " I ca n't expect you to understand . " <p> " Try me . " <p> His mouth quivered , poised between continuing his story and commanding her to refill the snifter . <p> " You might be surprised how much I can understand . " She held his gaze . " I might even be able to help you . " <p> " You can help me by pouring the drink . " <p> " That 's not the help you need . " <p> " There 's no other help . No other escape . " He turned toward the screen . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong , London - wherever I hide , they come . I thought that by watching them there - " He pointed to the screen . " I thought that the satellite feed might provide hints of when they were coming for me , but they just keep working - on and on , with no warning until I feel their thunder . That 's when I know I have to run . But no more . I 'm through running . This time I stay where I am . " He looked at the empty snifter . " Tonight I 'll hide in their sleep , their deep sleep - beyond reality , beyond dreams . " <p> She looked at the screen . " How can they come for you if they 're working ? " <p> " It is n't their bodies that come . It 's something else - gathering shadows ... booming darkness . " <p> " And what will these shadows do when they find you sleeping ? " <p> " I do n't know . I do n't want to know . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for the decanter . " Please . Help me . I 'll spill it if I pour it myself . I 'll pay you more if you want . Name your price , just pour it before - " <p> Nix 's bones quivered with a welling tremor that seemed to spill from somewhere beyond the gutted space . Floor and ceiling panels remained fixed within their frames . The crystal decanter and delicate snifter stood as before , unmoved atop the Lucite table . <p> Ajay Sumit gripped his chair 's padded arms as the tremors rolled through him . " They 're here . " He turned to Nix . " They 've found me . " The pits of his eyes were impossibly black , like the stuff in the decanter : a total void , the absence of color , the negation of the physical world . <p> The rumble came again . Nix steadied herself on the table and turned toward the door that led to the service elevator . " Coming closer . " <p> He grinned , a forced twisting of the lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . Explosions without fire , without smoke . The police should consider themselves lucky , do n't you think ? " He looked at her . " How lucky for them that they do n't see what we see ? " <p> " What we see ? " <p> " You 've seen the gathering shadows . I can tell . They 've left their stain in your eyes . " <p> It came once more : the tingling crackle , the quivering roar . She turned , looking through the glare , toward the closed door that led to the service elevator . And now she realized the reason for the vast , glowing room . For a man who fears an invasion of shadows , light is a tireless sentry . He had ripped out the walls , giving himself clear view of his shadowless domain . Darkness would not surprise him here . <p> He leaned against the Lucite , reaching toward the decanter . Perhaps he had resigned himself to pouring it on his own . Or maybe he intended to guzzle it unwarmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop him . She stepped forward , picked up the decanter , and backed away . <p> " Please . " His hands clenched on empty air . " Pour it for me . I 'll pay you anything you want . I 'll - " His eyes focused on something behind her . <p> She turned , looking back along the line of his gaze . <p> Across the room , a thread of darkness condensed in the glowing air . It fanned like spewing mist , expanding into advancing waves . <p> She asked , " What is it ? " <p> " The shadows of their dreams . " He glanced at the monitor . " I took their sleep . I left their dreams . " <p> Misty tendrils coalesced into human forms . Gaunt and emaciated , they pushed forward - shrouding the light as they spilled over the glowing panels . <p> He kept staring at the monitor , peering into the stacked frames full of hunched bodies and pounding needles . " See ! No change ! They just keep working . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , the advancing forms solidified until they resembled the racing bodies that she had followed into Hobbs Way . They crossed the room , fanning out as they approached the Lucite table . Ajay Sumit sat rigid as they flowed around him . He gripped his chair with trembling hands . Afraid to move . Unable to speak . <p> Nix turned in place , scanning the dark faces , gnarled hands , bleeding shunts - the dream images of people trapped in a waking nightmare . As one , they raised their withered arms . Empty hands clenched and opened , clenched and opened . Nix felt the heavy coldness in her own hands , and she realized what she had to do . <p> She stepped toward them . <p> Sumit coughed , finding his voice . " What are you doing ? " <p> She held out her hands , offering the decanter to a child with vacant eyes . <p> The springs of Sumit 's chair gasped as he rose . On the edge of her vision , Nix saw his hand blur toward her - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already on the crystal ... and Nix was already letting go . <p> " No ! " Sumit 's roar echoed as Nix released the decanter . What happened next was something she should have expected - something she should have realized even before her fingers drew back from the delicate crystal : the phantom workers were no more substantial than tendrils of mist . The decanter slipped through the child 's hands , tumbled through shaded air , and shattered against the floor . <p> Sumit grabbed Nix 's shoulder . She pulled free , stepping back as the liqueur spread across the panels , forming a blackened starburst that sputtered and foamed atop the fluorescent glow . And it was then , as the evaporating mist rose through the shades of errant dreams , that the shadowy shapes changed one last time . <p> Sumit covered his eyes , but Nix kept staring - watching as the skeletal arms became streamers . Faces angled into geometric rays . Chaos became symmetry . Colors bloomed from dirty shadows . For a moment , the transformed figures fused with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings and ovals and braided swirls - a mandala condensing out of the merging mist and shadow . And then , with an alpha blast that rang deep in Nix 's soul , the beauty exploded into streamers of light . <p> " They were n't coming for you . " She spoke without turning , staring at the empty air that hung above the shattered crystal . " Only to make you give up what you 'd taken . " <p> She heard the sigh of pneumatic supports as Sumit collapsed into his chair . " God ! " He spoke it more as a prayer than a curse : soft , breathy , full of awe . She turned to find him staring at the monitor . Within the stacked frames , workers continued to slave over clattering machines . " And still they work , " he whispered . <p> And then she heard the footsteps . Muffled . Coming closer . Rising through the partitioned stairwell forty feet away .... <p> The partition door flew open . Firefighters appeared , spilling into the room like a yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone out ! " Their boots squeaked on the Lucite panels as they advanced through the bright emptiness . <p> Sumit touched the screen . The display went dark . He lifted the monitor , folding the base so that it became a protective cover . His hands no longer trembled . Now his movements appeared sluggish - almost drugged - as if the single drink had begun to take effect . Nevertheless , his eyes flashed as he turned to Nix . " Tell no one . " His voice assumed a harsh whisper as he tucked the closed monitor beneath his arm . " I 'll pay you . " <p> So that was it . He would n't stop here . He would continue as before - exploiting the workers , robbing their sleep , and , when necessary , appeasing their errant dreams with spilled liqueur . And now , to keep things neat , he intended to buy her silence , as if her integrity had a price . <p> " I 'll contact you , " he said . " Through the courier office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , people ! " Two firefighters grabbed Sumit 's arms , leading him toward the stairs . <p> Another took hold of Nix . " You a courier ? " <p> " Yes . " She grabbed her helmet as he pulled her toward the door . <p> " You delivered something ? " <p> Sumit glanced back . <p> She held Sumit 's gaze and said , " I 'm sorry . " She looked him dead on . Then , turning to the firefighter , " It was a package . He asked me to open it . " She looked back toward the shattered glass on the floor . " There was a decanter inside , but I jumped when I felt the tremor . I dropped it . It shattered . " Again , she glanced toward Sumit . " I 'm sorry . It must have been very expensive . " <p> He smiled as if he forgave her , but she saw his expression for what it was - a conspirator 's grin . She had taken his offer . Like everything else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEY WOULD N'T LET her retrieve her bike . Instead , they whisked her through the lobby and onto a bus full of frazzled guests . Airbrakes sighed . The bus lurched forward , only to stop again as a black limousine cut across its path . She sensed that Ajay Sumit was inside that sleek black car , riding alone , perhaps asleep in the folds of his saffron robe , temporarily safe within a private darkness .... <p> She had once spoken to Ellen about the futility of railing against non-sleep sweatshops , an assessment that Ellen had echoed when Nix had tried ending her thesis with a carelessly thin " dream solution . " Change could never be effected unless the people in power had an incentive to listen . <p> But now someone in power could be given that incentive . Ajay Sumit , temporarily safe in his stolen sleep , would awake to find that the price of Nix 's silence was the adoption of her dream . <p> Author Affiliation                @ @ @ @ @
