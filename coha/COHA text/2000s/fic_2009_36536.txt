Being an overachiever sucked , Abby O'Brien Winters concluded as she crawled into bed after midnight , mentally and physically exhausted after a roller-coaster day on Wall Street . She 'd managed about twenty minutes of quality time with her twin daughters before they 'd fallen asleep barely into the opening paragraph of The Velveteen Rabbit . She 'd eaten warmed-over Chinese takeout for the third straight night , then pulled out a half-dozen voluminous market analysts ' reports she needed to absorb before the stock exchange opened in the morning . Her bedtime reading was a lot more challenging than what Caitlyn and Carrie chose . <p> She was good at her job as a portfolio manager for a major brokerage company , but so far it had cost her a marriage to a great guy , who 'd tired of playing second fiddle to her career , and more sleep than she could possibly calculate . Though she shared custody of the twins with Wes , she often felt as if she was barely acquainted with her five-year-old daughters . It sometimes seemed as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-husband  --  than they did with her . She 'd long since lost sight of exactly what she was trying to prove and to whom . <p> When the phone rang , Abby glanced at the clock and groaned . At this hour , it could only be an emergency . Heart thudding , she reached for the receiver . <p> " Abby , it 's me , " her sister Jessica announced . Jess was the youngest of the five O'Brien siblings and the real night owl among them . Abby stayed up late because it was the only way to cram enough work into a twenty-four-hour day . Jess did it because she was just starting to hit her stride when the moon and stars came out . " I called earlier , but the nanny said you were n't home yet . Then I got distracted with a project I 'm working on . I hope it 's not too late . I know you 're usually up till all hours . " <p> " It 's fine , " Abby assured her . " Is everything okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gram ? Or Dad ? " <p> " Gram 's amazing . She 'll outlive us all . And Dad is off someplace building something . I ca n't keep track of him . " <p> " He was in California last week , " Abby recalled . <p> " Then I guess he 's still there . You know he has to oversee every single detail when one of his projects is being built . Of course , then he loses interest , just the way he did with Chesapeake Shores . " <p> There was an unsurprising note of bitterness in Jess 's voice . As the youngest of five , she , more than the rest of them , had missed spending time with their dad . Mick O'Brien had already been making a name for himself as an architect and urban planner when he 'd designed and built Chesapeake Shores , a now-famous seaside community on the Chesapeake Bay . He 'd done it in partnership with his brothers  --  one a builder , the other an environmentalist . The town had been built around land that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first of the O'Briens to arrive from Ireland in the late 1800s . It was to be the crown jewel in Mick 's body of work and the idyllic place his family would call home . It had n't turned out that way . <p> Mick and his brothers had fought over the construction , battled over environmental issues and even over the preservation of the few falling-down historic buildings on some of the property . Eventually they 'd dissolved the partnership . Now , even though they all coexisted in or near Chesapeake Shores , they seldom spoke except on holidays , when Gram insisted on a pretense of family harmony . <p> Abby 's mother , Megan , had lived in New York since she and Mick had divorced fifteen years ago . Though the plan had been for all of the children to move to New York with her , for reasons Abby had never understood , that had n't happened . They 'd stayed in Chesapeake Shores with their mostly absent dad and Gram . In recent years , one by one they had drifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love-hate relationship with the town and with Mick . <p> Since moving to New York herself after college , Abby had reestablished a strong bond with her mother , but none of the others had done the same . And not just Jess , but all five of them had an uneasy relationship with their father . It was Gram  --  who 'd been only a girl when her family had followed their O'Brien predecessors to Maryland  --  with her fading red hair , twinkling blue eyes , ready smile and the lingering lilt of Ireland in her voice , who held them together and made them a family . <p> " Did you call to complain about Dad , or is something else on your mind ? " Abby asked her sister . <p> " Oh , I can always find something to complain about with Dad , " Jess admitted , " but actually I called because I need your help . " <p> " Anything , " Abby said at once . " Just tell me what you need . " She was close to all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , perhaps because of the big difference in their ages and her awareness of how their mother 's departure and their father 's frequent absences had affected her . Abby had been stepping in to fill that gap in Jess 's life since the day Megan had left . <p> " Could you come home ? " Jess pleaded . " It 's a little too complicated to get into on the phone . " <p> " Oh , sweetie , I do n't know , " Abby began , hesitating . " Work is crazy . " <p> " Work is always crazy , which is exactly why you need to come home . It 's been ages . Before the girls came along , you used work as an excuse . Then it was the twins . Now it 's work and the twins . " <p> Abby winced . It was true . She had been making excuses for years now . She 'd eased her conscience with the fact that every member of her family loved visiting New York and came up frequently . As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to matter that it was almost always on her turf rather than Chesapeake Shores . She 'd never stopped to analyze why it had been so easy to stay away . Maybe it was because it really hadn ' t felt like home after her mother had left . <p> Before she could reply , Jess added , " Come on , Abby . When was the last time you took a real vacation ? Your honeymoon , I 'll bet . You know you could use a break , and the girls would love being here . They should spend some quality time in the town their grandfather built and where you grew up . Gram could spoil them rotten for a couple of weeks . Please . I would n't ask if it were n't important . " <p> " Life-or-death important ? " Abby asked . It was an old exchange , used to rank whether any crisis was truly monumental or only a temporary blip in their lives . <p> " It could be , " Jess said seriously . " At least in the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're the only one who can fix this , or at least the only one I 'm willing to ask for help . " <p> Struck by the somber tone in her voice , Abby said , " Maybe you 'd better tell me right now . " <p> " You need to be here to understand . If you ca n't stay for a couple of weeks , then at least come for a few days . Please . " <p> There was something in her sister 's voice that Abby had never heard before , an urgency that suggested she was n't exaggerating her claim that her future was at stake . Since Jess was the only one of the five siblings who 'd been floundering for a focus since reaching adulthood , Abby knew she could n't turn her back on her . And admittedly a break would do Abby herself a world of good . Had n't she just been bemoaning her workaholic tendencies earlier tonight ? <p> She smiled , thinking about how wonderful it would be to breathe the salty Chesapeake Bay air again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her girls in a place where they could swing on the playground her father had designed for the town park , build sand castles on the beach and run barefoot through the chilly waters of the bay . <p> " I 'll work something out tomorrow and be down there by the weekend , " she promised , giving in . She glanced at her jam-packed schedule and grimaced . " I can only make it for a couple of days , okay ? " <p> " A week , " Jess pleaded . " I do n't think this can be fixed in a day or two . " <p> Abby sighed . " I 'll see what I can work out . " <p> " Whatever you can arrange , " Jess said at once , seizing the compromise . " Let me know when your flight 's getting in and I 'll pick you up . " <p> " I 'll rent a car , " Abby said . <p> " After all these years in New York , do you actually remember how to drive ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " My memory 's not that bad , " Abby responded . " See you soon , sweetie . " <p> " I 'll call Gram and let her know you 're coming . " <p> " Tell her not to go to any trouble , okay ? " Abby said , knowing it would be a waste of breath . " We 'll go out to eat . I 've been dying for some Maryland crabs . " <p> " No way , " her sister countered . " It 's a little early in the season , but if you want steamed crabs , I 'll find ' em somewhere and pick them up for Friday-night dinner . We can eat on the porch , but I 'm not about to stop Gram from cooking up a storm . I say let the baking begin . " <p> Abby laughed at her enthusiasm . Gram 's baking  --  pies , tarts , cookies , scones , cakes  --  was pretty amazing . There 'd been a time in her life when Abby had wanted to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that was before she 'd discovered an interest in and aptitude for the financial world . That had been her ticket out of Chesapeake Shores . <p> Now , after more than ten hectic years away  --  years spent climbing a treacherous corporate ladder , marrying , giving birth to twins and divorcing  --  she was going home for a real visit , something longer than a rushed weekend with barely time to relax before it was time to fly back to New York . She could n't help wondering , based on the dire tone in Jess 's voice , if that was a good thing or not . <p> " Could n't you at least put on a tie ? " Lawrence Riley grumbled , scowling at his son . " If you 're going to take over this bank , you need to set a good example for the employees . You ca n't come in here looking as if you just climbed off the back of a Harley . " <p> Trace regarded his father with amusement . " That 's exactly what I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father 's frown deepened . " I thought I told you to drive your mother 's car . You have an image to uphold now . " <p> " What was Mother supposed to do ? " Trace asked reasonably . " I could n't see her riding my Harley to her garden club meeting . " <p> " She has a dozen different friends who would have been happy to pick her up , " his father countered . <p> " And apparently not a one of them had any desire to run all her errands with her after the meeting , " Trace responded . <p> " You have an answer for everything , do n't you ? " his father grumbled . " This situation is never going to work if you do n't take me or this job seriously . " <p> " I always take you seriously , " Trace said . " As for the job , I do n't want to take it at all . I have a perfectly good career in New York . Just because I do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not respectable . " In fact , his career as a freelance design artist not only paid well , enabling him to live and work in a large loft in SoHo , it did n't require him to answer to his father . That was quite a perk in his book . <p> His father 's scowl deepened . " So , what ? I should let this community bank get gobbled up by one of the big banking conglomerates ? " <p> " Maybe so , " Trace said , knowing his response would only push his father 's hot button . " That 's the way the banking world is going . " <p> " Well , this bank wo n't , not as long as I have any say about it , " his father said stubbornly . " Chesapeake Shores Community Bank serves the people in this town in a way that one of those faceless , impersonal behemoths never could . " <p> Trace could n't argue the point . He just did n't want any part of running the place , family heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked , referring to his younger sister . He warmed to the topic . If he could convince his father to put Laila in the job she 'd always wanted , he could be on the road back to New York by morning . All he had to do was sell his father on the idea . " Think about it , Dad . She has a head for numbers . Her SAT math scores were through the roof . She aced all of her college business courses . She has a master 's degree from the Wharton School of Business . She 'd be a natural . " <p> " I thought of that , " his father admitted . " I even spoke to her about it , but your sister told me to take a hike . " <p> That was unexpected , Trace thought . " Why ? " <p> His father shrugged . " She said she was n't going to be anybody 's second choice , even mine . " <p> Trace regarded him with bewilderment . " But you asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid any attention to logic ? She 's convinced I only asked her because I knew you would n't want the job . " <p> " I do n't suppose you tried to convince her she was wrong , " Trace said . <p> " How could I when she was right ? " <p> " Do you think you two will ever learn to communicate ? " Trace grumbled . He and his dad might be at loggerheads ninety percent of the time , but Lawrence Riley and Laila were rarely on the same page about anything , from a choice as inane as breakfast cereal to a decision as critical as who ought to run the bank . It had been that way from the moment she learned to talk . <p> " You mean communicate the way you and I do ? " his father retorted wryly . <p> " Yeah , at least that well , " Trace responded . " Look , I 'll talk to her . I 'll smooth things over between the two of you . Her pride 's been hurt because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back here , but she 'll come around . " <p> His father hit his fist on the desk . " Dammit , you 're the one who needs to come around , Trace . What ever happened to family loyalty ? A man works his whole life to build up something good for his son , and you toss it aside without a second thought . " <p> " I 've had a lifetime to think about it . You 've never made a secret about what you expected . I 've given it a second thought and a third , for that matter , ever since you called . Dad , come on , you know the whole nine-to-five drill would never work for me . I like a job that 's creative , a word that tends to make bankers nervous as hell . " <p> The faint hint of a smile finally touched his father 's lips . " True enough , " he admitted . " How about this ? We give it six months . If you still hate it , you can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " <p> As a respected and in-demand artist working freelance for several of New York 's top ad agencies , Trace had the flexibility to do as his father asked . He could even keep up with a few accounts to keep himself from going totally stir-crazy in Chesapeake Shores . If it would buy him his freedom permanently , surely he could survive six months in a suit . He owed his father that much respect . And in the long run that short-term display of loyalty would be wiser than causing a family rift . <p> Moreover , he could spend the time trying to convince his sister to forget about her stupid pride and being second choice . She 'd wanted this job since she 'd learned to count . She ought to grab it , rather than wasting her talent by keeping the books for a few local businesses . Unfortunately she 'd inherited their father 's stubbornness . It would probably take Trace every single day of the allotted six months to make peace between the two of them . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not one day longer . " <p> His father beamed at him . " We 'll see . You might discover you have an aptitude for banking , after all . " <p> " Or you 'll realize I 'm incompetent when it comes to math . " <p> " I have your college test scores and grades that say otherwise . " He stood up and held out his hand . " Welcome aboard , son . " <p> Trace shook his hand , then studied his father intently . There was a glint in his eyes that suggested there was more to the negotiations than Trace had realized . " What are you up to ? " he asked warily . <p> " Up to ? " Lawrence Riley had a lousy poker face . Half of his pals at the country club would testify to that . For the past thirty years , they 'd lined their pockets with his losses . <p> " Do n't even try to play innocent , Dad . You 're up to something , and it has nothing to do with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made a business deal , that 's all , " his father insisted . " Now let me show you your office . It 's fairly Spartan now , but if you decide to stick around you can decorate it however you want . Meantime , I 'll have Raymond go through some loan folders with you . We have a meeting of the loan committee first thing Tuesday morning . You 'll need to have your recommendations ready then . " <p> Trace held up a hand . " Hold on a second . I do n't know enough to make recommendations on whether loan applications should be approved . " <p> " Raymond will show you the ropes . He 's been my right hand for years . And they 're not all loan applications . There 's a possible foreclosure in there , too . " <p> Trace 's stomach knotted . " You want me to decide whether or not someone 's home should be taken away and put up for auction ? " <br> Continues ...          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
