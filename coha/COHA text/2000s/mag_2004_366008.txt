As Thanksgiving approaches , many parents rush to give their children a crash course in MANNERS . Two decades ago , in a cover story on the return of etiquette , TIME looked at America 's often rocky relationship with the subject . <P> Despite the evidence of a revived interest in manners , a number of people would argue the exact opposite , that manners continue to get worse . " Manners have taken a beating these last 25 years , " says Eppie Lederer , a.k.a . Ann Landers , the advice columnist . " It is n't just that men are n't opening car doors for women or offering them seats on subways or buses . It goes deeper than that . The high crime rate is one thing that discourages openness and courtesy to strangers " ... Fran Lebowitz , who made her mark as a caustic social critic with Metropolitan Life ( 1978 ) , also feels that things are getting worse rather than better . " I do n't think people have manners , " she says . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the order of the day . There has been a return to convention , but that 's all nostalgia . "  --  TIME , Nov. 5 , 1984
