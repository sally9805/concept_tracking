Do babies really need another shot ? Children in the U.S. already get 10 to 20 vaccines and boosters in their first two years . Given how unhappy the needles make them  --  and how concerned parents are about side effects  --  pediatricians have been understandably reluctant to add a flu shot to the mix . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) did n't make things any easier by only " encouraging " flu shots for toddlers . <P> That changed last week , when a CDC advisory committee voted unanimously to " recommend " flu shots for all 6 million healthy American babies between the ages of 6 and 23 months . The change in wording is subtle but significant . It means most doctors will do it and most private insurers will cover the cost  --  about $10 a shot . To give everybody time to prepare , the recommendation wo n't take effect officially until next fall , although many doctors are likely to change their practices immediately . <P> There are good reasons to give toddlers flu shots . Influenza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans a year . Recent studies have shown that children are at higher risk than we thought and that they can significantly benefit from vaccinations . The shots wo n't be easy to administer ; this age group typically needs two doses the first time around  --  one in October , a second in November . It is hard enough to get parents to take kids in for even one visit once flu season strikes . <P> Speaking of the coming flu season , now is the time to get your own shot  --  before it 's too late . Two years ago , when there was a shortage of flu vaccine , health officials asked people ( except those in high-risk groups like the elderly and people with weak immune systems ) to hold back . This year supply is plentiful , and they 've changed their tune  --  urging just about everybody to get vaccinated . Not only will it cut down on the flu , but it will make it easier to spot cases of SARS should that flulike disease re-emerge . <P> Dr. Gupta is a neurosurgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
