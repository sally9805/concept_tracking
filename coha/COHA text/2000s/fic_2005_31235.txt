There 's no sweeter stench than the scent of a burning baby . Grace raced across the yard , her steps hastened by the cries upon the wind . " Somebody help me , " she cried . " My grandbaby 's trapped inside the house . " She grabbed a large branch and began to beat against a window . It broke away and released a menacing gust of fire that licked the edges of her hair and sent her reeling backward in a choking fit . The anguished cries from inside the house escaped through the broken pane , hanging upon the wind . " **52;550;TOOLONG ... " It was a wild and airy sound , a wailing that trailed off into a whirlwind of echoes . In the midst of the biting-cold night , the house was engulfed in a blizzard of flames . Polo stood out front , drenched in sweat , flinging buckets of water . The fire became more savage with each bucket he threw . Grace found her footing again and began beating her house with another tree branch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , out of breath . " It 's getting bigger . The water 's making it worse . " " Just keep trying . It 's got to be stopped . " " **52;604;TOOLONG ... " The cries of the baby were deafening . Polo threw away the bucket and grabbed a tree branch . He followed his mother 's lead and began to swat at the fire . Grace lifted her nose , catching the scent of the wind . " Oh my God . Oh my God . Oh my God . " She fell to her knees in exhaustion . " **52;658;TOOLONG ... " The haunting cry was like a lingering note in a dirge . Then it faded into the night and was never heard by Grace or Polo again . Grace raised her head and listened to the sound as it waned . Silent tears fell onto the dusty earth . If not for the gentle shaking of her shoulders as she dropped her head into her hands , Polo would not have known she was crying . " My grandbaby is dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to make out her words as she sobbed into her soot-stained palms . He thought she was asking about his sister . He wrapped his arms around her in a tight embrace . " Mama , Ophelia 's all right , " he said . " She 's out there by them fir trees . " Ophelia stood in the shadows of the woods , watching the fire gut the house . In the dazzling glow of the flames , she had seen her mother and brother trying to get to the baby and calm the blaze . Grace 's sobs grew heavy as the soot from her hands now covered her face . Her long black satiny hair hung loose and tangled around her head . Polo held his mother close , rocking her in his arms . The fire raged on before them , consuming the house . " Mama , we could n't do nuthin ' , " said Polo . " The baby was ' sleep when we went next door . It was n't nothing burning in the house .

She always be in the barn . " He rocked his mother faster . " She ai n't crying or even coming over here to ask ' bout the baby . I'on know , maybe she in shock . I guess she already knows he 's dead . " At those words , Grace fell onto her son 's chest and began to cry again . As the two held each other , the wooden porch collapsed , and the entire house folded in on itself . Polo 's girlfriend came running from across the field . " I could see it from my house , " she said . " I could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored her , rocking his mother . Coolie ran next door to Polo 's uncle 's house for more water . She returned , hurling the bucket so hard , the entire thing flew into the flames . " What are you doing ? " Polo cried . " The house ca n't be saved , it 's already gone . " " We got ta put the fire out , " she said . She ran next door for more water . Her short , curly hair was sticking to her face and neck in sweaty ringlets , and her peach-colored skin was flushed from the heat . She ran closer to the house . The fire licked at her , rushing up the front of her skirt . She screamed and danced around in a frenzy . Polo let go of his mother and leaped upon his girlfriend , throwing her to the ground . The fire on her skirt was extinguished as they rolled in the dust . Smoke rose from the hem in a funky puff . A car approached in the distance . Grace 's husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow ' 59 Ford . Before he had turned the engine off , Big Daddy and Grace 's brother , Walter , were dashing out of the car , running to the house . Within seconds they realized there was nothing either of them could do to save it . Big Daddy rushed over to Grace . Walter stood rooted , staring at the fantastic flames . " What happened , baby ? " Big Daddy said in his booming voice . Grace 's sobbing grew louder . " We was all next door just sittin ' around , like we 've done a hundred times before . Hamlet was in there . We did n't want to disturb him since he was ' sleep . The next thing you know , it 's this fire . My baby 's little boy done died in there . " Big Daddy grabbed his head and dropped to his knees beside her . He wrapped his tree-trunk arms around her and released his muffled cries deep within the security of her shoulder . Walter stood above them . " Ai n't nuthin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " It 's too far gone now . " He wanted to hug and comfort his sister , but Big Daddy and his overpowering strength were in the way . " Where 's Ophelia ? " Big Daddy asked , choking back tears . He looked around for his daughter amid the fire and smoke . Polo and Coolie pointed in the direction of the trees . Big Daddy turned to see Ophelia facedown in the dirt , her hands digging deep into the earth . Her body was wracked with sobs as they all watched her , alone in her pain . From the porch next door , Sukie looked out . She glanced at her husband , Walter , who was still staring down at Grace and Big Daddy . She looked at the burning house , now a frame shrouded in the brilliance of the fire . She noticed Ophelia in the thicket of trees , covered with dirt and leaves as she grieved in the darkness . Sukie shook her head . With a slow turn , she sucked her tongue and went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coolie had wasted .
