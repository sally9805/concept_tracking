We look back ... well , why look back ? The technological revolution has no rearview mirror . We have not only seen the future , we 've moved into it . Yesterday is history . Familiar forms will disappear . Who needs fiction when we have Survivor and the Florida Supreme Court ? And new formats will change what designer Bruce Mau calls " the global image economy . " Soon the multiplexes will go digital ; " films " will no longer exist . We 're already consuming e-books , e-movies , e-music . Egad ! <P> Why look back ? Because it 's time : this Dec. 31 , the second millennium will really end . And because the past , as recalled and transformed in classical and pop art , is the wisest guide to what lies ahead . Thus we codify the year 's pleasures in 10 Best lists , to determine which artifacts in the hall closet of recent memory are worth saving . <P> Even in an age humming with electronic innovation , the new takes its baby steps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our Tech 10 Best are binary clones of old friends . PayPal is the next Western Union ; the Nikon Coolpix 900 is the spawn of the Brownie . Nike will customize your sneakers , just the way your " artistic " aunt did for your eighth birthday . And Napster : free access to worlds of music ! It used to be called radio . <P> Not just technicians but creators have that retrospective spirit . Fully half of our cinema entries are set in the past , from a decade ago back to World War II and into the mythical mists of the Qing dynasty . Some of our top CDs are replays of Shostakovich and Django Reinhardt . The hip place for Londoners to see modern art is in a revamped old power station . The best of theater includes a Trojan War epic and something called Hamlet . And on our fiction list , No. 4 is ... Beowulf ! <P> So everything old is new again . And the new ? If it 's good , it will age very nicely .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
