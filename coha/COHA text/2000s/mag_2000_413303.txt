// In late December 1950 , the discouraged riflemen of the American Eighth Army shivered in snow-covered foxholes along the border between South and North Korea . A million Chinese Communist soldiers had swarmed into the Korean War . They had driven the 350,000-man American and South Korean army into headlong retreat . Everyone dreaded a new Chinese Communist attack . Morale was disastrously low . " Bug-out fever " infected companies and regiments , as soldiers ran for the rear at the first sign of a Chinese assault . Worse , the field commander of the army , General Walton Walker , was killed when his jeep overturned . Now to Revive an Arms Spirit President Harry S. Truman had the answer . He made General Matthew Ridgway the army 's new field commander . During World War II Ridgway had won fame as the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division . But few people thought this West Pointer ( class of 1917 ) - or anyone , really-could do much for the shattered Eighth Army . Ridgway 's first task : restore soldier morale .

" In unit after unit , Ridgway greeted sergeants by their first names . He memorized the names and faces of almost 5,000 enlisted men . He asked these men to share their gripes with him . They wanted warmer clothing and better food . Within days , Ridgway made sure they got both . Back at headquarters , Ridgway found defeatism running wild . A staff colonel described plans to get the Army out of Korea . " Are there any plans to attack ? " Ridgway asked him . " No , sir , " the colonel answered .

That cured the bug-out fever . Next Ridgway wrote a letter to his men , explaining why they were in Korea . He told them they were fighting an enemy who shot prisoners , enslaved its citizens and derided the dignity of man . They were defending the future of freedom for the whole world . A General 's Defiance On New Year 's Eve , the Chinese attacked . The outnumbered Americans and South Koreans retreated . But Ridgway proudly said they went " as a fighting army , not a running mob . " As they left Seoul , the capital of South Korea , Ridgway defiantly tacked to the wall of his headquarters an old pair of pajamas with the seat tipped .

Delivering a Counterpunch Less than a month later , on Jan. 25 , 1951 , the Americans stunned the Chinese by going on the attack .

Often his pilot , an ex-infantryman , grabbed a handy carbine and joined the battle raging around them . Again and again , Ridgway demonstrated his sympathy for the men in the ranks . He believed , he said , that " all lives are equal on the battlefield , and a dead rifleman is as great a loss in the sight of God as a dead general . " One day at the front , Ridgway saw a Marine private with a heavy radio on his back , stumbling over an untied shoelace . " Hey , how about one of you guys tying my shoe ?

Leadership-the Secret Weapon Fifty-four days after Ridgway took command , a transformed Eighth had recaptured Seoul and driven the Chinese back across the border . One from the lower ranks summed up the army 's new spirit with a wisecrack : " From now on , there 's a right way , a wrong way and a Ridgway . " " The American flag never flew over a prouder , tougher fighting force than the Eighth Army , " Ridgway declared . He told President Truman his men were ready to keep fighting and winning . But the president decided the independence of South Korea was now guaranteed and he was in a position to begin negotiating an honorable peace with the Communists . Military experts were baffled by the Eighth Army 's transformation under Ridgway .

U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered the American supreme commander in the Far East , General Douglas MacArthur , to send troops to help the South Koreans . After three months of bitter fighting , MacArthur surprised the Communists by landing a large force at Inchon , far behind the enemy 's lines . The North Korean Army collapsed . They were rescued by the Chinese Commuist Army . After General Matthew Ridgway 's revived Eighth Army defeated the Chinese , the Communists agreed to peace negotiations . More than 54 , 000 Americans died in Korea and 103,000 were wounded . Communist forces were at least 10 times higher .
