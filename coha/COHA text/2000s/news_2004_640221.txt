<p> WASHINGTON - Lawmakers challenged Pentagon officials Wednesday to revamp policies to better protect service members who have been raped , and they stressed that if the military fails to act , Congress will . <p> During a four-hour hearing , members of the Senate Armed Services Committee called a recent string of reported rapes in the military ' shocking , ' and they urged the military to standardize services for victims to keep them safe . <p> Committee chairman John Warner , R-Va. , promised to ' take over ' reform of military practices unless serious action is taken . And Sen. Saxby Chambliss , the Georgia Republican leading the investigation , stressed that soldiers should not have to fear being attacked in their own camps . <p> Chambliss , addressing military leaders in a room packed with more than 200 people , said that his subcommittee 's interviews with assault survivors and others showed ' shocking percentages of sexual assaults suffered by women in uniform . ' <p> ' They ( soldiers ) need to know that they can operate on a daily basis in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Department of Defense officials responded by saying they will not tolerate sexual assault and acknowledged that they have launched several procedural reviews to address criticisms of their systems , including another task force within the Army . <p> ' All of our policies are up for review , ' said Undersecretary of Defense David Chu . ' All of them are on the table . ' <p> That brings to five the number of government investigations into the armed forces ' handling of sexual assault and domestic violence cases , including an internal investigation ordered in February by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld . The inquiries were prompted by articles in The Denver Post chronicling widespread problems with victim services , such as a lack of advocates , and leniency for thousands of sexual-assault suspects who avoid prosecution . Many alleged victims also faced punishment after reporting crimes . <p> The Post also reported that dozens of women returning from war duty in Iraq have sought assistance because of alleged attacks by fellow soldiers while overseas . <p> Wednesday 's hearing featured , at times , vigorous questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and culture . A round of questioning , for example , exposed gaps in Defense Department policy that may force a rape victim to continue working with a commander who allegedly assaulted her . <p> Chambliss and other Senate leaders billed the hearing as the first of several , emphasizing that ' we are not here today to prosecute anybody . We are here to look at facts and to do our job , which is oversight of the U.S. military . ' <p> Military justice analysts say the lawmakers ' questions about the military legal system , which gives commanders the power to decide whether soldiers face prosecution , show they are serious about probing the military . ' Those senators who brought it up , they 're to be commended , ' said Eugene Fidell , director of the National Institute of Military Justice . ' I hope it 's a sign of things to come . ' <p> Chambliss asked whether the department had policies that addressed the safety of rape victims who report assaults by supervisors , citing his recent conversation with a victim who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same company as her commander . No specific policy exists , Chu responded , saying the decision is left to a senior commander at the scene . <p> ' That bothers me , ' Chambliss said . ' a I really think this is something the ( Defense Department ) task force should look at . ' <p> Chu agreed . <p> Senators were told that the number of cases involving female soldiers who allegedly were sexually assaulted while serving during the Iraq and Afghanistan operations had reached 68 . The military has reported 88 sexual-misconduct cases but declines to specify how many involve assaults . <p> Christine Hansen , executive director of the Miles Foundation , testified that common patterns thread through many of the cases , including a lack of complete investigations , lack of medical treatment and no separation from their alleged attackers . A lack of victim advocates and counselors also is being reported to the foundation , a civilian victim advocacy organization that helps military victims . <p> Victims ' significantly fear a negative impact , ' Hansen said , adding that is the reason victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hansen proposed the creation of an Office of the Victim Advocate at the top echelons of the military to channel more services to victims and to protect their rights . <p> Danielle , a sexual-assault victim interviewed after the hearing , said she believes victims desperately need such a representative . <p> Some of the same complaints about lack of advocacy and counseling have been made by trainees at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas , according to nearby civilian rape crisis center officials . <p> ' Questions are being asked of them that are not being asked of civilians anymore , such as were you drinking , what were you wearing , ' said Deborah D. Tucker , executive director of the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence . ' Those kind of old-school strategies . ' <p> Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , said she has been disturbed by the reports of women soldiers being assaulted by men in their own ranks during the recent wars . <p> ' No war comes without costs , ' said Collins , ' But the cost should be borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our own troops . Why is there less public outrage when servicewomen suffer at the hands of servicemen than from the enemy ? This can not stand . ' <p> Sen. Ben Nelson , D-Neb. , and at least two other senators pressed Chu on whether Rumsfeld had authorized a critique of the military justice system , drawing assurances from the undersecretary that the review would include all military policies . <p> But every general questioned Wednesday defended the Uniform Code of Military Justice and giving the commanders discretion to decide punishments for crimes , saying it was necessary to maintain discipline and unit cohesion within the ranks . <p> Adm . Michael G. Mullen , the Navy 's vice chief of operations , described the system as ' the heart and soul of who we are and what we do . ' <p> But under questioning from Sen. Mark Pryor , D-Ark. , who suggested the code might need updating , the generals said they would support a review of the system . <p> ' I would welcome a review that makes it better , ' Mullen said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to testify , but ' we are not ruling out anything as we move forward . ' <p> Danielle , whose mother was in the audience , said she was disappointed . ' If they have no faces , how are we real to them ? ' <p> Rep. Louise Slaughter , D-N.Y. , however , plans to organize a hearing this spring or early summer in the House to address the issue through the women 's caucus . Slaughter said she will seek testimony from victims . <p> Miles Moffeit can be reached at 303-820-1415 or mmoffeit@denverpost.com .
