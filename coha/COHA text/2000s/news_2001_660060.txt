<p> There is probably no country on earth where US military might is more welcome than it is in Kuwait . In anniversary celebrations here this week , former President George Bush and retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf are being hailed as heroes for leading the international coalition that evicted Iraq from this tiny Persian Gulf state a decade ago . The war against Iraq states of Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates . In one of the Gulf War 's most important legacies , the US maintains a steady presence of about 4,500 troops here to deter future aggression against Kuwait , which controls 10 percent of the world 's known oil reserves . US aircraft depart from Kuwaiti bases , among other places in the region , to patrol the skies over Iraq . Just do n't ask US officials to discuss their military role in the Arabian states of the Persian Gulf in any detail . " We 've made a conscious decision across the <p> region not to be specific , " says Lt. Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which oversees most of the Middle East . This sort of cageyness contrasts with how US officials present the American military role in , say , East Asia . The 100,000 US troops based in Japan , South Korea , and aboard ships are endlessly touted as necessary to Asian security and prosperity . The US may be the protector of the Persian Gulf , but it has to speak very , very softly . The reasons range from America 's relationship with Israel to the leverage that oil gives the Gulf states , but the bottom line is the same : Few people in the Gulf are enamored of their guardian . " We want to be aligned with the Americans , we want to be defended by them , but in a low-key way , " says a Kuwaiti businessman . Beginning with the British decision to pull back from the region in 1971 and culminating in the 1991 Gulf War , the US replaced Britain as the guarantor of regional security . America 's ties to Iran and Saudi Arabia were once the bulwarks of the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which America was derided as a " great Satan " - created a need to find new friends and solidify the relationship with Saudi Arabia . Today , Bahrain discretely hosts the Navy 's 5th Fleet , and the Army stores tanks and other war-fighting supplies in Kuwait and Qatar . " We have aircraft ' forward-deployed ' in the region and that 's as specific as you 're going to get , " says Colonel Thomas . Somewhere between 17,000 and 24,000 US troops are on duty in the Gulf , most on rotations lasting a few months . Kuwait provided $ 176 million in financial support for the US military during 1999 , according to a Department of Defense report to Congress last year . The Kuwaiti contribution , which leads among the Gulf states , pales in comparison to the $ 4 billion Japan paid in 1999 . <p> ' We are dangerous too ... ' A massive training exercise held in the Kuwaiti desert on Sunday - involving US , Kuwaiti , and British forces - demonstrated a readiness to deal with a return visit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a range of exploding devices to pulverize mock enemy tanks that were obvious stand-ins for Iraqi invaders . As the desert sun set before them and concussive waves from the explosions shook the air , Mr. Bush , General Schwarzkopf , and senior Kuwaiti officials watched the display from a carpeted pavilion on " VIP hill . " Afterward , Schwarzkopf said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein " is a very , very dangerous man , but we are dangerous , too , and he ought to remember that . " Leaving aside the Kuwaitis and the Saudis , more and more Arabs are convinced that Iraq - weakened by a decade of sanctions and hobbled by two US-imposed " no fly " zones - does n't pose that much of a danger . " For us , I do n't see that threat , " said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa , standing next to Secretary of State Colin Powell at a press conference in Cairo on Saturday . But Mr. Moussa acknowledged that those in the Gulf states feel otherwise . Even if the threat from Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back its military presence in the Gulf anytime soon . Even though the Gulf states are working on common defense arrangements , inner divisions and conflicting priorities suggest a force big enough to deter heavyweights such as Iraq and Iran is decades away . <p> Some Kuwaitis fear US influence " I do n't see who else would be there if it is n't us , " says Michael Palmer , a historian at East Carolina University , in Greenville , N.C. , and the author of a book on the US role in the Gulf . " I do n't think any of the Gulf states could last long without an external presence . " In previous decades , alongside the need to secure US access to oil , the American idea was also to push the Gulf states down the road of liberalization , democratization , and the Western way of doing things . The overriding strategic interest remains oil , but the other goals have been sidelined in deference to local sensibilities . " The Arabs in general do n't like foreigners on their land , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser , who is attending the anniversary celebrations here . But the reasons for speaking softly go beyond xenophobia . America 's support for Israel makes life in the Arab world uncomfortable for Kuwait and other Gulf states . Iraq routinely lambastes the Kuwaitis in particular for being an American puppet and for hosting US forces that routinely attack an Arab state - Iraq . " The general perception ... is that Americans have come to dominate the Gulf : to promote investment and to Americanize the Gulf , " says Abdullah Sahar , an international relations professor at Kuwait University . US officials would deny any such intention , but the people of the region are sensitive about the erosion of what they call their " traditional societies . " Islamist politicians take advantage of this sensitivity , rallying supporters around the idea that the region should be free of foreigners and able to defend itself . The Americans and the Gulf regimes are united in their desire to tamp down such ideas . But America 's role as protector does n't make it impervious to the leverage that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil supplies , another reason why the US opts to speak softly about its role here . <p> Here for the long haul ? There are indications that the US presence is gradually becoming more entrenched . This week the US and Kuwait renewed a 10-year defense cooperation agreement , a decision that provokes roughly zero controversy in a country where newspapers effusively thank Americans for their actions during the Gulf War . The desert tent-city that houses most US troops rotating through Kuwait is slowly becoming a bit more permanent - last year the sleeping tents were fitted with air-conditioning and heating systems . Cement pads replaced sand floors . As in other parts of the world , US troops in Kuwait are told to behave carefully when mixing with the local population . The restrictions are partly to protect the troops from becoming the target of an unexpected attack and partly to prevent untoward incidents . One Army sergeant who recently rotated through Kuwait says troops were told never to look at women garbed head-to-toe in black , as many Kuwaiti women are . " The ones that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , but do n't touch . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
