<p> Jim DeStefano and Ed Hottle are trying to see who is crazier . It 's neck and neck . <p> DeStefano , the athletic director at Gallaudet , has this wild idea : Let 's bring back varsity football to the world 's only liberal arts university for the deaf and hearing-impaired . Never mind that it 's been 11 years since the Bison last played as a varsity team . Forget that  --  with the exception of an outstanding four-year run in the late 1980s  --  Gallaudet football has not had a winning season since 1930 . <p> Hottle makes a strong challenge : He can hear , and had never before communicated with a deaf person . He applied to become Gallaudet 's football coach . <p> " Why not ? " said Hottle , 32 , who coached last season at Calvert High in Southern Maryland ( where his team finished 1-9 ) , and was previously an assistant at three small colleges . " It 's challenging . It 's unique . You 've got to remember : Football is football , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On June 30 , he hired Hottle to be the 33rd coach since Gallaudet began playing football in 1883 , and enlisted Hottle in a two-hour daily sign-language tutorial that began July 18 . Tomorrow , Hottle will run his first practice at Gallaudet with an eye on 2007  --  when he and DeStefano hope to return the Bison to full varsity status , playing in Division III . <p> The administration " made it very clear they wanted to keep football , " DeStefano , who is deaf , said through an interpreter . " But it was very hard to maintain at the club level because a lot of kids were n't interested in playing if it was at the club level . " <p> DeStefano said the varsity program disbanded following the 1994 season because of what he termed " lack of interest " from the student body . As a club program , Gallaudet did not subsidize the football team , did not play other varsity teams , and did not employ a full-time coach . <p> DeStefano said it would cost at least $200,000 annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fundraising campaign DeStefano launched to purchase field lights and bleachers for the field on the school 's Northeast campus . <p> DeStefano has not entirely sold the rest of the administration on football just yet . He thinks a varsity football program will attract more students , not only those who want to play football , but also from the program advertising the Gallaudet name . <p> " The bottom line is we need to get the numbers , " DeStefano said . " If we get kids to the school and get enrollment to increase , everyone will see . If we hired a football coach , it would help us in recruiting kids from all over the United States . " <p> Hottle said , " In the minds of some people , they see it as the big , bad football monster . " <p> In fall 2004 $9,630 , with room and board another $8,270 . By those figures , it would take at least an extra dozen students each school year to offset the costs for the football program . <p> " While I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provost Jane K. Fernandes wrote in an e-mail , " I expect that some students who might have opted to attend another university will enroll at Gallaudet now that we have varsity football and a full-time coach . <p> " The desire by student-athletes and alumni to bring back Division III football has been expressed since football was changed to club status several years ago . Most compelling to me were those comments from future students indicating that they wanted to enroll at Gallaudet for our academic programs and to play Division III football . " <p> Hottle said he expects 57 players at practice tomorrow , and has a list of 80 high school seniors nationwide he intends to contact in the coming weeks , as well as several players at junior colleges . <p> Because Gallaudet can only recruit deaf players , Hottle will have the benefit of seeking talent from a nationwide pool  --  a factor that sets the program apart from others at the Division III level and was a key part of the job 's appeal , Hottle said . But that does n't mean landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disabilities Act , or ADA , was passed in 1990 , DeStefano said it has been tougher to recruit deaf athletes . An increasing number of deaf students are staying at their local high schools rather than going to deaf-only schools because the ADA provides interpreters for deaf students if they prefer to go to a non-deaf school . DeStefano estimates only about a dozen deaf high schools play 11-man football , about half as many as 20 years ago . <p> One of them , though , is the Maryland School for the Deaf , which has won 24 straight games  --  many against non-deaf schools  --  dating from October 2002 . It would seem a perfect recruiting spot for Hottle . <p> " I 've heard kids have had a resistance to coming here , " Hottle said , " because there 's no recent history of success . We 're going to change that . " <p> He might want to talk to MSD Coach Andy Bonheyo , who has won eight national deaf championships at three schools , including Model , which is located on Gallaudet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be identified because the matter was sensitive , Bonheyo was Gallaudet 's top choice for the job , but the two could not agree on a deal . Bonheyo and MSD Superintendent James E. Tucker declined to comment for this story , and Gallaudet officials also declined to discuss other candidates for the job . <p> If Hottle has any second thoughts , he need only make a call to Bob Westermann . <p> In 1977 , a 25-year-old Westermann saw a newspaper classified ad for a high school football coach . Model wanted to begin a football program . Westermann , a chatty extrovert from New Jersey , was not deaf and could not sign . He took the job anyway . <p> After leading Model to four national deaf prep championships in eight seasons , Gallaudet asked him to revive its program in 1985 . The Bison had not won more than three games in a season since 1930 , and just five years earlier , did not field a team when only 18 players came out . Westermann still took the job . <p> " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind . You 've got a good thing going at Model . You 're going to go over there to Gallaudet and get killed , ' " said Westermann , who now manages retirement communities in Washington state . " But the administration wanted to infuse pride and excitement on Saturday afternoons . They wanted kids to have the full college experience . " <p> In Westermann 's four seasons at Gallaudet , the Bison never had a losing record , and went a combined 27-13 . The 1987 team went a school-best 9-1 , including a 21-8 victory over Georgetown , and narrowly missed the Division III playoffs . <p> Westermann believes Hottle can do the same . <p> " He has to hold fast to the idea that this group can win at this level , " Westermann said . " The Xs and Os part can all be overcome . The issue is , does he have the support of the administration to go out and recruit ? <p> " I think he 's got a great opportunity in front of him . The key to success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to be a part of it . <p> " We had a happy campus . It did a lot for the pride of the student body . "
