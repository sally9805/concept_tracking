CHAPTER TWO  --  August 16th , 1793 ... the first and most principal to be , a perfect skill and knowledge in cookery ... because it is a duty well belonging to women .  --  Gervase Markham The English House Wife , 1668 As soon as I stepped into the kitchen , Mother started her lecture . " Too much sleep is bad for your health , Matilda . " She slipped a freshly made ball of butter into a stone crock . " It must be a grippe , a sleeping sickness . " I tried not to listen to her . I had not cleared the wax from my ears all summer , hoping it would soften her voice . It had not worked . " You should be dosed with fish oil . When I was a girl ... " She kept talking to herself as she carried a steaming pot of water outside to rinse the butter churn . I sat down at the table . Our kitchen was larger than most , with an enormous hearth crowded with pots and kettles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The size of the room did not match the size of our family . We were only three : Mother , Grandfather , and me , plus Eliza who worked for us . But the roomy kitchen could feed one hundred people in a day . My family owned the Cook Coffeehouse . The soon-to-be famous Cook Coffeehouse , Grandfather liked to say . My father had built our home and business after the War for Independence ended in 1783 . I was six years old . The coffeehouse sat just off the corner of Seventh and High Streets . At first we were lucky if a lost farmer strayed in , but business improved when President Washington 's house was built two blocks away . Father was a carpenter by trade , and he built us a sturdy home . The room where we served customers filled most of the first floor and had four large windows . The kitchen was tucked into the back , filled with useful shelves and built-in cupboards to store things . We could have used a sitting room , truth be told . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he fell off a ladder and died of a broken neck two months after the coffeehouse opened . That 's when Grandfather joined us . A coffeehouse was a respectable business for a widow and her father-in-law to run . Mother refused to serve spirits , but she allowed card games and a small bit of gambling as long as she did n't have to see it . By midday the front room was usually crowded with gentlemen , merchants , and politicians enjoying a cup of coffee , a bite to eat , and the news of the day . Father would have been proud . I wondered what he would have thought of me . " Good morning , " Eliza said loudly , startling me . " I thought you were going to sleep the day away . Have you eaten ? " She set a sack of coffee beans on the table . " I 'm starving , " I said , clutching my stomach . " As usual , " she said with a smile . " Let me get you something quick . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meal fit for pigs . I found this amusing , considering our last name was Cook . In a manner , though , it was serious . If not for Eliza 's fine victuals , and the hungry customers who paid to eat them , we 'd have been in the streets long ago . Mother 's family had washed their hands of her when she ran off to marry a carpenter , a tradesman ( the horror ! ) , when she was but seventeen . So we were very fond of Eliza . Like most blacks in Philadelphia , Eliza was free . She said Philadelphia was the best city for freed slaves or freeborn Africans . The Quakers here did n't hold with slavery and tried hard to convince others that slavery was against God 's will . Black people were treated different than white people , that was plain to see , but Eliza said nobody could tell her what to do or where to go , and no one would ever , ever beat her again . She had been born a slave near Williamsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bought her freedom right after they were married . She told me that was the best day of her life . She moved to Philadelphia and cooked for us , saving her wages to set her husband free . When I was eight , she got a letter saying her husband had been killed by a runaway horse . That was her worst day . She did n't say a word for months . My father had only been dead two years , so Mother knew just what lay in Eliza 's heart . They both supped sorrow with a big spoon , that 's what Mother said . It took years , but the smile slowly returned to Eliza 's face . She did n't turn sour like Mother did . Eliza was the luckiest person I knew . She got to walk from the river past shop windows , market stalls , and the courthouse up to Seventh Street every morning . She told stories even better than Grandfather , and she knew how to keep a secret . She laughed once when I told her she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She dished up a bowl of oatmeal from a pot that hung by the side of the hearth , then carefully set it in front of me . " Eat up , " she said . One corner of her mouth turned up just a bit and she winked . I tasted the oatmeal . It was sweet . Eliza had hidden a sugar lump at the bottom of the bowl . " Thank you , " I whispered . " You 're welcome , " she whispered back . " Why is Polly late ? " I asked . " Have you seen her ? " Eliza shook her head . " Your mother is in a lather , I promise you , " she warned . " If Polly does n't get here soon , she may need to find herself another position . " " I bet she 's dawdling by the forge , " I said , " watching Matthew work with his shirt collar open . " " Maybe she 's ill , " Eliza said . " There 's talk of sickness by the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . " Serving girls do n't get sick , " Mother said . " If she does n't appear soon , you 'll have to do her chores as well as your own , Matilda . And where is your grandfather ? I sent him to inquire about a box of tea an hour ago . He should have returned by now . " " I 'd be happy to search for him , " I offered . " I could look for Polly , too . " Mother added wood to the fire , poking the logs until the flames jumped . The delicate tip of her shoe tapped impatiently . " No . I 'll go . If Father comes back , do n't let him leave . And Matilda , see to the garden . " She quickly tied a bonnet under her chin and left , the back door closing behind her with the sharp sound of a musket shot . " Well , " said Eliza . " That 's it , then . Here , have some veal and corn bread . Seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After she cut me two slices of cold veal and a thick piece of fresh corn bread , Eliza started to make gingerbread , one of her specialties . Nutmeg and cinnamon perfumed the air as she ground the spices with a pestle . If not for the heat , I could have stayed in the kitchen for an eternity . The house was silent except for the popping of the applewood in the fire , and the tall clock ticking in the front room . I took a sip from a half-filled mug on the table . " Ugh ! It 's coffee ! " Black coffee , bitter as medicine . " How can you drink this ? " I asked Eliza . " It tastes better if you do n't steal it , " she answered . She took the cup from my hands . " Pour your own and leave mine be . " " Are we out of cider ? " I asked . " I could get some at the marketplace . " " Oh , no , " Eliza said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that poor garden is like to expire . It is time for you to haul some water , little Mattie . " Little Mattie indeed . Another month and I 'd be almost as tall as Eliza . I hated to be called " little . " I sighed loudly , put my dishes in the washtub , and tucked my hair into my mob cap . I tied a disreputable straw hat atop the cap , one I could never wear in the street , and snatched a bite of dough from Eliza 's bowl before I ran outside . The garden measured fifty paces up one side and twenty along the other , but after six weeks of drought it seemed as long and wide as a city block , filled with thousands of drooping plants crying for help . I dropped the bucket into the well to fill it with water , then turned the handle to bring it back up again . Little Mattie , indeed . I was big enough to be ordered around like an unpaid servant . Big enough for mother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water to the potato patch and poured it out too fast . Big enough to plan for the day when I would no longer live here . If I was going to work as hard as a mule , it might as well be for my own benefit . I was going to travel to France and bring back fabric and combs and jewelry that the ladies of Philadelphia would swoon over . And that was just for the dry goods store . I wanted to own an entire city block  --  a proper restaurant , an apothecary , maybe a school , or a hatter 's shop . Grandfather said I was a Daughter of Liberty , a real American girl . I could steer my own ship . No one would call me little Mattie . They would call me " Ma'am . " " Dash it all . " I had watered a row of weeds . As I returned to the well , Mother came through the garden gate . " Where 's Polly ? " I asked as I dropped the bucket down the well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I spoke with her mother , with Mistress Logan , " Mother answered softly , looking at her neat rows of carrots . " And ? " I waved a mosquito away from my face . " It happened quickly . Polly sewed by candlelight after dinner . Her mother repeated that over and over ,  --  she sewed by candlelight after dinner . ' And then she collapsed . " I released the handle and the bucket splashed , a distant sound . " Matilda , Polly 's dead . "
