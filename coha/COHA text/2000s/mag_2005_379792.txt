Dr. Dora Akunyili and her family were driving down a rural road in Nigeria three years ago when snipers opened fire on her car . " The back windscreen was shattered , " she says . " A bullet pierced through my head scarf and grazed my scalp . " Akunyili had been targeted by a drug gang  --  but not the kind that sells heroin or cocaine . These drug dealers traffic in counterfeit medicine  --  ineffective at best , deadly at worst  --  and as director general of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control ( NAFDAC ) , Akunyili 's job aims to put them out of business . <P> Bad medicine is a huge problem in Nigeria . Before Akunyili took over her post in 2001 , a staggering 80% of the medications sold there were deficient in one way or another . Some contained less of the active ingredient than was specified on the label . Others were past their expiration date . Some were filled with inert lactose or powdered chalk . Still others were poison . In 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made with toxic ethylene glycol instead of propylene glycol . In 2003 phony adrenaline led to the deaths of three children undergoing surgery in the city of Enugu . Akunyili 's sister Vivian , a diabetic , died in 1988 , a victim of fake insulin . <P> Akunyili 's first move , when she took over the drug-control agency , was to restrict pharmaceutical imports to just two airports and two seaports , each staffed by NAFDAC officials . The agency also made a list of 19 Indian and Chinese companies that had been indicted for manufacturing fake drugs and banned their products . It placed analysts in India and China to recertify any drugs manufactured in those countries before they could be shipped to Nigeria . <P> NAFDAC went on the offensive back home as well , conducting nearly 800 raids on drug-distribution outlets and 90 " destruction exercises " on counterfeit or substandard medicines . " We are winning , " says Akunyili . " Made-in-Nigeria drugs are now acceptable in other West African countries . Multinational drug manufacturers that left out of frustration are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very popular with the local drug cartels . The sniping incident was only one of several attempts on her life . NAFDAC 'S offices have been fire bombed and its personnel attacked by gunmen . No wonder her family wants her not to accept another five-year term when the current one expires next year . But Akunyili , 51 , has not made up her mind . " God gave me the opportunity to do something , " she says , " and so far , God has been protecting me . " <P> Like many committed health professionals in the developing world , Akunyili brings an almost messianic zeal to her work . " Drug faking or counterfeiting is the greatest evil of our time , " she says . " Malaria can be prevented , HIV/AIDS can be avoided and armed robbery may kill a few at a time , but fake drugs kill en masse. "
