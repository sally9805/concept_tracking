<p> Give Miles the chance to unseat Sen. Campbell <p> Re : ' Senate hopeful feels spurned ; Democrat Miles questions party 's quest for big name to challenge Campbell , ' Feb. 18 news story . <p> What can Rutt Bridges offer to educators ? What can he offer for the veteran vote or the minority vote ? The military vote or the civil rights vote ? The truth is that he can offer cash , and that is about it . <p> Mike Miles has already garnered some 6,000 volunteers and hundreds of delegates . He has opened a campaign office with another planned to open in Denver . He has a full-time staff , Gary Hart 's former presidential fund-raiser . He has a statewide coordination network and has activated the state 's grassroots base for the past two years . This is an indication of how strong his presence is in the party . Entry by a last-minute candidate or anything less than the leadership Miles has offered will only split the Democratic Party 's active base . <p> The highest priority right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles has been doing just that for the last two years . <p> CHARLES HERTENSTEIN <p> Colorado Springs <p> BLM plan is multiuse <p> Re : ' Grazing plan is unbalanced , ' Feb. 15 editorial . <p> The Denver Post 's editorial provides an unbalanced description and analysis of the Bureau of Land Management 's proposed grazing rule . <p> The Post asserts that the BLM 's proposed regulations ' could upset the delicate political and environmental balance ' that the paper says resulted from the 1995 grazing rules changes . This is far from the truth . To begin with , the BLM 's proposed rule would make no changes in the rangeland health standards and guidelines developed by the bureau 's resource advisory councils ( RACs ) under the ' Rangeland Reform ' rules of 1995 . In addition , the proposed rule would not affect the existing RAC system , in which the BLM receives advice and recommendations from 24 citizen-based councils across the West . The BLM values the RACs ' input and will continue to solicit their advice , and thus The Post 's charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils ' is completely unfounded . <p> As for other provisions of the 1995 regulations , the BLM believes that the current regulatory framework needs to be changed in ways that will improve the agency 's working relationships with ranchers , who are the day-to-day stewards of the public rangelands . The BLM is convinced that these regulatory changes will result in better stewardship of lands that are crucial for open space and wildlife habitat in the rapidly growing West . The proposed rule would , among other things , allow the BLM and a grazing permittee to share title of certain range improvements , such as a fence , well or pipeline . <p> The proposed grazing rule would also make changes that would advance the bureau 's efforts to ensure rangeland health . For example , the proposal would require not only observational assessments but also in-depth information collection , known as monitoring , to analyze resource conditions , resulting in better long-term management decisions . The proposed rule would also remove the current three-consecutive-year limit on temporary ' non- use ' of a grazing permit by allowing livestock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time , whether for conservation or business purposes . <p> The bottom line is that the BLM 's proposed grazing regulation changes are balanced , reflecting the agency 's mission to manage the public lands for multiple uses . When finalized and implemented later this year , the BLM 's new grazing regulations will produce benefits not only for ranchers and Western rural communities , but for all who use , enjoy and appreciate our nation 's public lands . <p> JAMES M. HUGHES <p> Deputy Director , Programs and Policy <p> Bureau of Land Management <p> Culture of rape ? <p> As an out-of-state resident , my impressions of Colorado are unfortunately formed by the national media . As a result , my impression of the University of Colorado , and Colorado in general , is reduced to one word : rape . Between Kobe Bryant , the Air Force Academy and now CU , I have to wonder if there is something in the water . <p> Regardless of football coach Gary Barnett 's reputation , the only airplay he is getting nationally is basically for attacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't kick a football . <p> The University of Colorado will always be referred to as ' Rape U. ' Has a nice ring to it , does n't it ? <p> JOE GUMINO <p> Washington , D.C. <p> How , in Colorado ? <p> The outrageous behavior of the University of Colorado Board of Regents , president and football coach suggests that this program is completely out of control . I feel sorry for the taxpayers who are providing the $ 1.5 million salary to such a despicable individual as the CU football coach and would hope that your governor and attorney general have the authority and intelligence to at least retrieve his salary and fix this scene . I am appalled that any public institution has allowed these criminals to rise to such prominence . How has this happened in such a beautiful place ? <p> SAMUEL R. NEWCOM <p> Atlanta <p> Ditch AD position <p> Re : ' CU should ax Tharp , ' Feb. 20 editorial . <p> The Post writes in its editorial that after firing the athletic director , the University of Colorado 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the state and federal taxpayers who foot its bills . ' How ? <p> Gordon Gee is chancellor of Vanderbilt University in Nashville , and he was president of CU from 1985-1990 . Last year , Gee abolished the athletic director position at Vanderbilt . Athletic programs now report directly to him . Gee made the decision because , as Sports Illustrated reported ( Sept. 22 , 2003 ) , ' he perceived athletic departments as islands , answering to no one , spending ridiculous amounts of money and flaunting the standards of academia - not to mention decent society . ' <p> CU 's current president , Betsy Hoffman , should follow the example of CU 's former president . This would serve the taxpayers , not to mention the tuition- paying students , private donors , commercial sponsors , and ticket-buying fans who also support CU . <p> BURKE BEU <p> Denver <p> What 's acceptable <p> If the president of the University of Colorado was raped by a football player , and football coach Gary Barnett was questioned about it , would ' She was a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable reply ? <p> ROBERT B. NELSON <p> Little Rock , Ark . <p> Hoffman misspoke <p> Re : ' Hoffman open to Barnett 's return ; CU president : Prove culture is respectful of women , ' Feb. 20 news story . <p> The statement by University of Colorado President Betsy Hoffman , suggesting that CU football coach Gary Barnett had said it was ' essentially a OK for the guys to rape ' former CU player Katie Hnida , is one of the most irresponsible statements I have ever heard from a public official . As a CU alumnus and parent , I call on the CU Board of Regents to immediately terminate Hoffman 's employment with the university . She is an embarrassment . <p> THOMAS J. GLEASON <p> Denver <p> DA doing her job <p> I am at a loss to understand why some people are shooting the messenger in the University of Colorado football scandal . Boulder District Attorney Mary Keenan has not sought the limelight , yet she has not shirked her duty . Keenan did not ask to be deposed . The university did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted to refute , yet Keenan answered the questions as required . She has appropriately charged or not charged players according to the evidence and rules of law . She has not gone on to the national press circuit , where she could have inflamed the situation . At every step , she has fulfilled her professional obligation , using common sense and demonstrating the highest moral and ethical character . <p> Our DA has focused on the truth , working to correct the root cause of the problem and offering to work with all parties to resolve the situation . Keenan has acted in an ethical and professional manner . <p> Let 's stop shooting the messenger and focus on correcting the problem in our community . Let 's work to enhance the academic reputation of the university , talk about the remarkable research done at CU , deal with the state fiscal issues related to higher education , and support an environment of respect for all students , athletes and employees at the university . And let 's be thankful that Mary Keenan is district attorney in Boulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
