Chapter One A PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE is a fascinating sight , particularly at night , and particularly from the air . Even from twenty miles out and ten thousand feet up-on approach to Denver International Airport 's runway 17R-both pilots of the Gulfstream IV could clearly see the red-and-blue flashing lights of the entourage on the ground at about one o'clock , beginning to snake westward down Pena Boulevard . The late November air was cool , crisp , and cloudless . A full moon bathed the flat plains below and the Rockies jutting heavenward to the right with a bluish tint and remarkable visibility . A phalanx of two dozen police motorcycles led the way toward downtown Denver , forming a V , with the captain of the motorcycle force riding point . Then came a dozen Colorado State Patrol squad cars , four rows of three each , spread out and taking up all three lanes of westbound highway with more lights and more sirens . Two jet-black Lincoln Town Cars followed immediately , carrying the White House advance team . These were followed by two black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Secret Service . Next-one after the other-came two identical limousines , both black , bulletproof Cadillacs built to precise Secret Service specifications . Thefirst was code-named Dodgeball . The second , Stagecoach . To the untrained eye it was impossible to know the difference , or to know which vehicle the president was in . The limousines were tailed closely by six more government-owned Suburbans , most carrying fully locked-and-loaded Secret Service assault teams . A mobile-communications vehicle followed , along with two ambulances , a half dozen white vans carrying staffers , and two buses carrying national and local press , baggage , and equipment . Bringing up the rear were a half dozen TV-network satellite trucks , more squad cars , and another phalanx of police motorcycles . Overhead , two Denver Metro Police helicopters flanked the motorcade-one on the right , the other on the left-and led it by at least half a mile . All in all , the caravan lit up the night sky and made a terrible racket . But it was certainly impressive-and intimidating-for anyone who cared to watch . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just packed a DIA hangar and tarmac to see their former governor-now president of the United States-come home for Thanksgiving , his last stop on a multistate " victory tour " after the midterm elections . Some had stood in the crosswinds for more than six hours . They 'd held American flags and hand-painted signs and sipped thermoses of hot chocolate . They 'd waited patiently to clear through incredibly tight security and get a good spot to see the president step off Air Force One , flash his warm trademark smile , and deliver one simple , Reaganesque sound bite : " You ai n't seen nothin ' yet . " The crowd absolutely thundered with approval . They 'd seen his televised Thanksgiving-week address to the nation from the Oval Office . They knew the daunting task he 'd faced stepping in after Bush . And they knew the score . America 's economy was stronger than ever . Housing sales were at a record high . Small businesses were being launched at a healthy clip . Unemployment was dropping fast . The Dow and NASDAQ were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The long war on terrorism had been an unqualified success . Al-Qaeda and the Taliban had been obliterated . Osama bin Laden had finally been found-dead , not alive . Forty-three terrorist training camps throughout the Middle East and North Africa had been destroyed by the U.S. Delta Force and British SAS commandos . Not a single domestic hijacking had occurred in the past several years-not since a U.S. air marshal put three bullets in the heart of a Sudanese man who single-handedly tried to take over a U.S. Airways shuttle from Washington Dulles to New York . And thousands of cell members and associates of various terrorist groups and factions had been arrested , convicted , and imprisoned in the United States , Canada , and Mexico . Overseas , however , the news was n't quite as good . The global economy still struggled . Car bombs and assassinations continued to occur sporadically throughout Europe and Asia as remaining terrorist networks-unable to penetrate the U.S.-tried to find new ways to lash out against the allies of the " Great Satan . " One newspaper editorial said the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heads of some cells at home only to see others pop up around the world . This was true . Many Americans still felt unsafe traveling overseas , and global trade , though improving , remained somewhat sluggish . But within the U.S. there was now a restored sense of economic optimism and national security . Domestically , at least , recessions were a thing of the past and terrorism seem ed to have been quashed . Presidential promises made were promises kept . And the sense of relief was palpable . As a result , the president 's job-approval ratings now stood steady at a remarkable 71 percent . At this rate he 'd win reelection in a landslide , probably pick up even more House seats and very likely a solid Senate majority as well . Then the challenge would be to move to the next level , to bolster the U.S. and international economies with his sweeping new tax cut and simplification plan . Could he really get a single-rate , 17 percent flat tax through Congress ? That remained to be seen . But he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say 10 percent and 20 percent . And that might be good enough . Especially if he abolished the capital-gains tax and allowed immediate write-offs for investment in new plants , buildings , equipment , high-tech hardware , and computer software , instead of long , complicated , Jurassic Park-era depreciation schedules . But all that was a headache for another day . For now , it was time for the president to head to the Brown Palace Hotel in downtown Denver and get some rest . Wednesday night he 'd attend a Thanksgiving-eve party and raise $4.2 million for the Republican National Committee , then join his family already up at their palatial lodge , nestled on the slope of the Rockies in Beaver Creek , for a cozy , intimate weekend of skiing and turkey and chess . He could smell the fireplace and taste the sweet potatoes and marshmallows even now . * * * The motorcade cleared the airport grounds at 12:14 Wednesday morning . Special Agent Charlie McKittrick of the U.S. Secret Service put down his high-powered night-vision binoculars and looked north , scanning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the distance , he could see the lights of the Gulfstream IV , a private jet chartered by some oil-company executives that was now the first aircraft in the holding pattern and waiting to land . Whenever the president , vice president , or other world leader flew into an airport , all other aircraft were prevented from landing or taking off , and the agency tasked with maintaining complete security put an agent in the tower to keep control of the airspace over and around the protectee . In this case , until Gambit-the code name assigned to the president-was secure at the Brown Palace , McKittrick would maintain his vigil in the tower and work with the local air-traffic controllers . The holding pattern was now approaching five hours in length , and McKittrick had heard the G4 pilots repeat four times that they were running low on fuel . He hardly wanted to be responsible for a foul-up . It was n't his fault the flight crew had n't topped their tanks in Chicago rather than flying straight from Toronto . But it would certainly be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the radar screen beside him and saw thirteen other flights behind the Gulfstream . They were a potpourri of private and commercial aircraft whose pilots undoubtedly could n't care less about the White House victory lap or the Secret Service . They just wanted their landing instructions and a good night 's rest . " All right , open 17R , " McKittrick told the senior air-traffic controller , his voice suggesting an unhealthy combination of fatigue and fatalism . " Let 's get the G4 down and go from there . " He cracked his knuckles , rubbed his neck , and swallowed the last of his umpteenth cup of coffee . " TRACON , this is Tower . Over , " the senior controller immediately barked into his headset . Exhausted , he just wanted to get these planes on the ground , go home , and call in sick the next day . He desperately needed a vacation , and he needed it now . Linked by state-of-the-art fiber optics to the FAA 's Terminal Radar Approach Control facility three miles south of the airport , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over . " " TRACON , we 're bringing in the Gulfstream on 17 Romeo . Put all other aircraft on notice . It wo n't be long now . Over . " " Roger that and hallelujah , Tower . Over . " The senior controller immediately switched frequencies to **32;838;TOOLONG , and began putting the Gulfstream into an immediate landing pattern . Then he grabbed the last slice of cold pepperoni-and-sausage pizza from the box behind McKittrick and stuffed half of it in his mouth . " Tower , this is Foxtrot Delta Lima , Niner Four Niner , on approach for 17 Romeo , " said the Gulfstream . " We are going to increase speed and get on the ground as quickly as possible . Roger that ? " His mouth full , the senior controller thrust his finger at a junior controller by the window , who immediately jumped into action , used to finishing his bosses ' sentences . The young man grabbed a headset , and patched himself in . " Roger that , Foxtrot . You 're cleared for landing . Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be here any more than these guys wanted him to be . But they 'd better get used to it-all of them . If Gambit won his reelection campaign , he might as well open up his own bed-and-breakfast. * * * On board the Gulfstream , the pilot focused on the white strobe lights guiding him in and the green lamps imbedded down both sides of the runway . He did n't have to worry about any other planes around him , because there were n't any . He did n't have to worry about any planes taxiing on the ground , because they were still in the Secret Service 's holding pattern . He increased speed , lowered the landing gear , and tilted the nose down , taking the plane down from ten thousand feet to just a few hundred feet in a matter of moments . A few minutes more and the long night would be over . * * * Marcus Jackson munched on peanut M &M's; and tapped away quietly on his Sony VAIO notebook computer as the motorcade sped along at well over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House correspondent , Jackson was permanently assigned Seat 1 on Press Bus 1 . That put him just over the right shoulder of the driver , able to see and hear everything . But having awoken at 4:45 a.m. for baggage call in Miami-and having visited twelve states in the past four days on the president 's Thanksgiving Tour-Jackson could n't care less what could be seen or heard from his coveted seat . All he wanted to do now was get to the hotel and shut down for the night . Behind Jackson sat two dozen veteran newspaper and magazine reporters , TV correspondents , network news producers , and " big foot " columnists-the big , brand-name pundits who not only wrote their political analyses for the Times and the Post and the Journal but also loved to engage each other on Hannity &; Colmes and Hardball , O'Reilly and King , Crossfire and Capital Gang . All of them had wanted to see the president 's victory lap up close and personal . Now all of them wanted it to be over so they , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some updated their Palm Pilots . Others talked on cell phones with their editors or their spouses . A junior press aide offered them sandwiches , snacks , and fresh , hot coffee from Starbucks . This was the A team , everyone from ABC News and the Associated Press to the Washington Post and the Washington Times . Together , what the journalists on this bus alone wrote and spoke could be read , watched , or listened to by upward of 50 million Americans by 9 a.m . So they were handled with care by a White House press operation that wanted to make sure the A team did n't add to their generally ingrained bias against conservative Republicans by also being hungry , cold , or in any other way uncomfortable . Sleep was something national political reporters learned to do without . Starbucks was n't . A former Army Times correspondent who covered the Gulf War , then moved back to his hometown to work for the Denver Post , Jackson had joined the New York Times less than ten days before Gambit announced his campaign for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was getting tired . Maybe he needed a new assignment . Did the Times have a bureau in Bermuda ? Maybe he should open one . Just get through today , Jackson thought to himself . There 'll be plenty of time for vacation soon enough . He glanced up to ask a question about the president 's weekend schedule . Across the aisle and leaning against the window sat Chuck Murray , the White House press secretary . Jackson noticed that for the first time since he 'd met Murray a dozen years ago , " Answer Man " actually looked peaceful . His tie was off . His eyes were closed . His hands were folded gently across his chest , holding his walkie-talkie with a tiny black wire running up to an earpiece in his right ear . This allowed him to hear any critical internal communications without being overheard by the reporters on the bus . On the empty seat beside Murray lay a fresh yellow legal pad . No to-do list . No phone calls to return . Nothing . This little PR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nothing else Murray or his press team could do to get the president 's approval ratings higher than they already were , and he knew it . So he relaxed . Jackson made a mental note : This guy 's good . Let him rest . * * * Special Agent McKittrick was tired . He walked over to the Mr. Coffee machine near the western windows of the control tower , out of everyone 's way , itching to head home . He ripped open a tiny packet of creamer and sprinkled it into his latest cup . Then two packets of sugar , a little red stirrer , and voil-a new man . Hardly . He took a sip-ouch , too hot-then turned back to the rest of the group . For an instant , McKittrick 's brain did n't register what his eyes were seeing . The Gulfstream was coming in too fast , too high . Of course it was in a hurry to get on the ground . But get it right , for crying out loud . McKittrick knew each DIA runway was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a navy pilot , he figured the G4 needed only about three thousand feet to make a safe landing . But at this rate , the idiots were actually going to miss-or crash . No , that was n't it . The landing gear was going back up . The plane was actually increasing its speed and pulling up . " What 's going on , Foxtrot ? " screamed the senior controller into his headset . When McKittrick saw the Gulfstream bank right toward the mountains , he knew . " Avalanche . Avalanche , " McKittrick shouted into his secure digital cell phone . * * * Marcus Jackson saw the bus driver 's head snap to attention . A split second later , Chuck Murray bolted upright in his seat . His face was ashen . " What is it ? " asked Jackson . Murray did n't respond . He seemed momentarily paralyzed . Jackson turned to the front windshield and saw the two ambulances and the mobile-communications van pulling off on either side of the road . Their own bus began slowing and moving to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcade began rapidly pulling away from them . Though he could n't see the limousines , he could see the Secret Service Suburbans now moving at what he guessed had to be at least a hundred miles an hour , maybe more . Jackson 's combat instincts took over . He grabbed for his leather carry-on bag on the floor , fished through it frantically , and pulled out a pair of sports binoculars he 'd found handy during the campaign when the press was kept far from the candidate . He trained on the Suburbans and quietly gasped . The tinted rear windows of all four specially designed Suburbans were now open . In the back of each of the first four vehicles were sharpshooters wearing black masks , black helmets , steel gray jumpsuits , and thick Kevlar bulletproof vests . What sent a chill down Jackson 's spine , however , was n't their uniforms , or their high-powered rifles . It was the two agents in the last two vehicles , the ones holding the Stinger surface-to-air missile launchers . ( Continues ... )    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
