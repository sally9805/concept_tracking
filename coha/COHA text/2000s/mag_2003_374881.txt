The most basic bias of " concerned " documentary films is toward the humane . Few fail to imply some measure of hope for their generally downtrodden subjects or to imagine some form of sociopolitical action that might relieve their condition . Stevie makes a few feeble gestures toward those conventions . But should you choose to endure Steve James ' film , you are likely to emerge questioning not just the basic documentary premise but , possibly , such optimism as you may harbor about the whole , yes , damned human condition . <P> James , who directed the acclaimed Hoop Dreams in 1994 , takes as his subject here a young man named Stevie Fielding . When James was in college , he served as Stevie 's Big Brother , then sought him out after Hoop Dreams ' release . What he found , living in a bleak Illinois hamlet , was a human being about as messed up as it is possible to be . In his 20s , Stevie is jobless , feckless and has a rap sheet . He is also fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anyone else . Fairly early in the film he is jailed for sexually abusing his young niece , and though he denies it , everyone we see  --  even the anguished James  --  eventually comes to disbelieve him . <P> The doubters include his silent , perpetually angry mother , whom he volubly loathes ( she abandoned him as a child ) ; his stepgrandmother , who raised him when he was not in foster care ; a sister , the film 's most sympathetic figure ; and a girlfriend with a serious speech impediment who is standing by her man . James becomes a figure in his own film , guilt ridden about his earlier abandonment of Stevie but still the only person present capable of offering him sensible , always unheeded , counsel as Stevie 's case wends toward sentencing . <P> Stevie could cite extenuating circumstances . There is no doubt that he was sexually abused in foster care . There is no doubt that his essentially loveless upbringing created the seething sullenness of his nature . There is no doubt that all the social-service systems in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his victimization does not make him the least bit sympathetic . <P> Is it exploitative to tell his story ? One finally thinks not . He is surely representative of all our lost and abandoned . Can one recommend this unblinking film to the average moviegoer , out for a good time ? Only in this way : if James and his crew can spend years with these blighted souls , surely you can spend two hours with them , exploring compassion 's outer limits .  --  By Richard Schickel
