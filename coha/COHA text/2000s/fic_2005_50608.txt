SO PEOPLE ASK YOU what you do , and you tell them you work in a clean room , making wafers that make computer chips . And then they say , oh do you wear a bunny suit ? like they 're interested , and when you say yes , then they ask , so where 's your long ears and fluffy tail ? As sure as the suns gon na set in the west , someone at the tables gon na say this and it 's your responsibility to go along and be a sport and not act like , oh that 's , what-the ten-millionth time I 've heard that one in this lifetime ? That 's what Em says to do when we get home , and I 'm still chewing it over . She says it 's good for me-being a young , able-bodied white man in America-to take crap every now and then . <p> But sometimes at work , it seems like I 'm the last regular American guy in America . Like you say good morning to ol ' Dennis at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of normal Americans behind . In the gowning roomthe memo said , Do n't call it locker room anymore , call it gowning room-there 's Gregor ( not Greg ) the Russian , and Wu Han Lee and ten thousand of his closest personal friends and family from Korea . There 's also Harris ( not even close to his real name ) from Ethiopia , who works with me in the area called Thin Filmsand we 're sort of the Starsky and Hutch of Thin Films , or so I tell myself . We pull off our polar fleece and sweaters-we get down to ratty T-shirts-and yes , Virginia , we do wear clothes under bunny suits . We pull the suits on over our pants and shirts and slip on our designated tennis shoes , and then we have to wash our hands for one full minute-there 's a timer over the sink-and that 's a long time to wash your hands , so we do n't . Then there 's the hairnet that feels like an insult the first hundred times you put it on and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , to 7-Eleven on break . Then finally there 's the hood and surgical mask , so all that 's left of us is our eyes . But nobody notices eyes in the Fab anyway . <p> See , your personality changes when you go into the Fab , known to civilians as the Fabrication Room . I talked it over with Em several times-she 's usually still typing casualty reports on her old electric typewriter on the kitchen table even at oh dark-thirty when I finally get home . She sits there tap-tapping and looking like she ca n't take it anymore , and sometimes I stand behind her and rub her shoulders . But more often I just sit in the plastic lawn chair across from her and talk about thoughts and theories that I 've been cooking up all day long in the Fab . And Em says the suits are the company 's way of stripping us of our individuality-like they do with guys in prison-so we ca n't rise up and throw off our chains or start a union . I do n't actually think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the bunny suits . They both have accents so thick that sometimes I have to be the translator between them , even though they 're both speaking English . <p> But the thing about the personalities is that people go through this little warp . Not like the time Captain Kirk gets split into the evil Kirk versus the nice , wussy Kirk . It 's subtler than that . It 's like the loud , pushy people get quiet and sort of resigned and the timid , no-talkers turn sort of feisty and sassy . It 's like the suits give everyone a chance to try on their secret hidden identities . <p> The only one who did n't really change is Buck . He 'd be the same inside the suit and out : 100 percent silent . His face never moved a muscle . He would raise his eyebrows sometimes . And when you said something funny-and I mean funnyhe might open his mouth and sort of rock back and forth like he 's doing an imitation of someone laughing , but without sound . <p> Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his lack of noise used to bother me . In my first three months at Integrated Circuitry , Inc. , he showed me how to use about twenty machines with barely saying a single word . When I 'd ask a question , he might say yes or no or he might just raise his eyebrows , as if to ask , what 's your problem ? After I told Em about Buck , she said , " It 's because he 's an Indian . " <p> Now right here I 've got to stop and inform you that I used to call them Indians , too , before Em . Emma 's half-Mexican and half-Snohomish . I met her when I shared a picnic table with her at the Burrito King truck . I took one look at her , and I know it 's a clich and all-but what can I say ? An arrow in my heart . I knew that I absolutely had to spend the rest of my life with her . Her beauty was like something that exploded inside of me , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born . <p> Em says she can call them Indians because she is one . I , on the other hand , either have to do an investigative report to find out the particular tribe of the person in question , or , worst case , call them Native Americans . Just like I had to learn to stop calling Hillsboro-where Integrated Circuitry and the Burrito King areHillsburrito . And I also had to stop doing my imitation of the way India-Indians talk , though I have more trouble with that one because sometimes it just seems to come spilling automatically out of me , especially after I 've spent an hour with Thermal Navagavalon up in the Etch Department . Em 's dad-her Snohomish side-liked to call me That White Kid , also because I 'm thirty and Em 's forty . He 'd say , When the hell you gon na marry her , White Kid ? <p> Anyway , Em explains how Buck is typical Indian , even though I 've seen plenty of her dad and her cousins and their seventy-five kids and none of them acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was watching Buck carry around a pod of wafers , and first I was thinking how they 're paying us ten bucks an hour and that one of those stupid little wafers that we tote around all day long is worth about ten times more than we make for a whole day 's work . And then trying not to even think about what a diamond ring costs ... <p> But then I was also thinking how if , say , my peopled been living here peacefully , making our longhouses and totem poles and whale art and all , and then a bunch of white people came pouring in wrecking everything , killing everybody , and generally taking over , then , yeah , I would n't have a lot to say to me either . Em practically has me watching the news now-though maybe it 's more because she has it on . I 'll be sort of watching out of the corner of my eye , and it could be bombs in Iraq or a tank about to mow down some Arab-and she 'd switch it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning when she has to go to work . <p> Which all for some freakish reason helped me to get over feeling bothered about Buck . I almost started to like him and his nontalking , the way he left you alone-which is so much more than you could say about , for example , Gregor . Thus , I took a particular interest when we were in the lunchroom one day , eating lunch-Buck had his steady tuna fish sandwich , and I was going through a phase where I was trying to train myself to eat salad-and Buck out of nowhere says , " I really miss Albuquerque . " <p> Now this is news to me . I look around to see if anyone else is present to record this historic event , but no . I 've been working at IC for more than three years at this point , and I think this might be the first fully formed sentence I 've heard Buck speak . So I perk right up and say , " Oh , you 're from Albuquerque ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's about it . <p> But that 's plenty . I ca n't wait to tell Em . I even finish lunch early so I can call her to tell about my encounter . But when I call the insurance company , her evil boss Sandra with the insane rat dog with the bulging , bloodshot eyes answers the phone and pretends she still does n't know who I am and says no , Em 's just gone to lunch . So I run into the gowning room and tell Harris , and he laughs and says in his African giant voice , " No way , man . That Buck , he does n't believe in speaking . " <p> I worked in a fly-fishing shop for three years before I went over to IC . It was the longest job I 'd ever had anywhere , and I liked it because it was pretty peaceful there in the shop and you got great deals on the gear , sometimes even free reels or lines from the company reps . I amassed a small fortune of top quality rods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights , plus the best high-tech GORE-TEX waders , float tubes , pontoons , and deluxe river boots . <p> But I was making $6.50 an hour at Murph 's Streamborn and I had this idea that I wanted to save Em from a life of working for the evil Sandra . Even though going from $6.50 to $9.50 represented nearly a one-third pay increase , it still adds up to not enough to save anybody from anything . <p> Not to mention it was n't like everything was peaches and cream for me and Em . Sure there was explosions and hearts and flowers , especially when we started up . But there was also that she wanted a kid and I did n't . Lately she was saying she 's a forty-year-old woman and I do n't understand her biological imperative . And I 'd say , Yeah , and I 'm a thirty-year-old man and she did n't understand mine . Then she 'd say , In ten years when you want a baby , it 'll be too late . And I could kind of see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , like an idea you see written in a book , not like something you feel , like the way I wanted to hold Em , the two of us alone in the world , not some yard-ape spying on us from a playpen . <p> In addition , there was the fact that she 'd been married before . In the time when I was dropping in and out of lame job after lame job or wading around in the Metolius or the Deschutes or the Crooked River , Em was trying to realize her wife-and-baby dream with someone other than myself . This loser by the loser name of Perry still calls her , comes knocking on our door , crying at our kitchen table , and sleeping on our living room couch . <p> I do n't claim to be rolling in the clover , but at least I can hold down an actual job . Perry got fired from a job driving an ice cream truck . Plus he has this long , thinning , albino hair tied in a skinny ponytail and white blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not white , but at least I am humanly capable of getting tan in the summer . I 'm some part English and Irish , but I 'm also part Swiss-not Germanso that 's a little interesting , in my humble opinion . Well , Perry , who 's about as dark as a fishbone , got Em by telling her when they met in junior college-in a typing class-that he 's one-quarter Navaho ! First of all , he ca n't do basic fractions because it 's supposedly his great-grandfather who 's the supposed Native American-who he has the balls to actually refer to as " Great Grandfather . " second of all , Navaho is the kind of tribe you say you are when you cant think of anything else to make up . To sum it up : Even if they were only married for eleven months , if Em could fall for a guy like Perry , what did that say about me ? <p> It could be that I 'm making excuses , which my dad says is my favorite pastime . Because the last problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest to solve , is that Em wanted to get married . And I had n't quite asked her . Yet . She started mentioning it around our second year together , got kind of upset in our third , and in our fourth she pretty much dropped it except for occasionally muttering that she did n't know what she was waiting around for . We talked about it . Talked , yelled . In my head , I kept coming back to the idea that I had to get her a big diamond ring . I 'd seen one in her women 's magazine that had written in tiny letters in the corner Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars . Well , believe it or not , I do n't have any spare thousands lying around cluttering up the place . But somehow I became fixated on the idea of this perfect ring . That this was The Ring that she had to have . It would be The Ring that would save us from ending up like her and loser Perry , in some cut-rate divorce lawyer 's office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily they 'd escaped without babies . The ring I wanted was a platinum circle with a shining , rectangular stone , floating over a blue-sky page . And I could never in a million years afford it . <p> So Buck became exceedingly fascinating to me around the time that Em started muttering . I was n't stalking him or anything , but I admit I was watching him out of the corner of my eye . It was almost enough to inspire me to get out of bed on work mornings , which in my case is saying something . The drones at IC work a compressed week where we get a long weekend-three days off one week and four days off the next ; but we also work twelve-hour torture shifts . So when it 's Monday morning and you 're sleeping till noon , it 's the greatest job in the world , and when its Thursday and you 're waking up in the freezing pitch black to " Purple Rain " blasting on the radio alarm , then you 're hating the job with every molecule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-cylinder Hyundai with the ten million other drones on Highway 26 , thinking : Thirty years of age and what have I got to show for it ? <p> But like I was saying , Buck started to offer a little welcome diversion . One day it was the Albuquerque remark ; next it was : " I 'm going to Albuquerque on my vacation , " stated in the locker room in front of me and Harris-which I was damn glad of because I was starting to feel like the guy who saw Bigfoot . <p> " I did n't know you were taking a vacation , " I say , really quiet , like trying not to scare away a wild animal . I 'm waiting for the eyebrows , which would n't even be so bad since it was n't necessarily a comment you had to answer . But he goes and shocks the hell out of me and Harris , saying , " Yeah , to Albuquerque . " And Harris does his 40,000-watt grin . <p> After that I started sort of checking every now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the bunny suits you become a master of detection . You can tell people apart by all kinds of tiny clues-the blue glasses , the hunch , the pot belly , the pointy head . And then you always know their rank by their footwear : Drones such as myself wear the company-issue tennis shoes , but the engineers ( referred to in some circles as " the smart ones " ) wear plastic slip-on overshoes , so you can still see some vestige of the person they once were through the plastic film . At IC it 's overshoes versus tennis shoes . And believe me , this is just the way management likes it , convinced as they are that not a single person who 'd work as a tech at their company actually has two brains to rub together . ( At the orientation meeting , they put cartoon transparencies on the overhead projector to make some tiny point , and the orientation guy proceeds to explain the cartoon panel by panel , like your grandpa might have done when you were four years old : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's sitting at the engineer 's desk .... " ) Anyway , the shoes give management a quick and efficient way of keeping us all sorted out . But after a few months there , you feel like you 've almost got ESP anyway ; you can tell Drone , Smart One , Equipment Guy , Management with a single glance , and sometimes I do n't even have to look . <p> So it 's easy to get the feeling that you really know everybody in the Fab , at least everyone in your area . But the more I thought over the whole Buck affair , the more I did n't know anything . I 'd be watching the Surfscanner or nodding off at the Leica microscope checking wafers-one second I 'm fine and the next my eye is knocking into the eyepiece and waking me up-and the whole time I 'm trying to think about more things to ask him about Albuquerque . I figured out Albuquerque was like Buck 's magic key : if you asked him a question with that word in it , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tested this theory twice . First time I ask , " So what 's Albuquerque like ? " And he says , " It 's OK . " And then I say , " So how many people live in Albuquerque ? " Eyebrows . That 's 50-50 , which considering my previous experience with Buck is not bad . <p> All this information exchange happens in one work week . Then I spend the four-day weekend sleeping till noon and watching Fly-Fishing with Lefty Kreh and basically trying to think up Albuquerque questions . Em asked what I 'm up to , which goes to show how she 's got all of my ways and means memorized . We have Sunday together . And when she has to get up and leave the warm bed at 7:00 AM on Monday , I feel just about as bad as I do on the mornings when I have to get up and go off at 5:30 , but then I roll over and go back to sleep because I 've got three more days of freedom . When I go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albuquerque questions that I thought up over the weekend : What is the job situation like there ? and How much does it cost to buy a house there ? <p> Unfortunately , when I get to work I discover that it 's a Troy day . Troy is this guy who used to work full time as an IC drone until he somehow got himself into the engineering program at PSU . He 'd worked out a satanic deal with management that he could come in pretty much anytime he pleased and pick up some extra work , which was usually about once a week . <p> Troy had a girlfriend named Annabelle who he used to arrange to see about once a month . Then he 'd go on about how she was always pissing and whininghis words-about wanting to do more together , and he 'd say , What did she want , and Why were women like that ? But he kept her-again , his words-because of her massive rack , which he would also go on about in vivid detail if you stood in his vicinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you were bored , standing around waiting for the scrubber machine to finish , you could float over in his direction and take in a few minutes of Troy like the way Em reads a paragraph or two of the National Enquirer when she 's waiting in line at the cash register . Anyway , I always felt bad for Annabelle-that just seemed like a nice name to me , and I pictured a sweet , slightly fat girl whose back hurt from toting her chest around . <p> At lunchbreak , a bunch of us are sitting there , Troy giving us the particulars of Annabelle getting fatter , when out of the blue , he says , " So Buck , I hear you 're going to Albuquerque on vacation . " <p> I 'm disgusted-like , who does he think he is talking to Buck ? I wait for the eyebrows , but for some reason Buck decides to dignify this comment with a " Yep . " And then Troy says , " Why , what 's in Albuquerque ? " Which floors me because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now I 'm kicking myself and I almost do n't want to look at Buck , but I cant help myself because I absolutely want to know , and he says , " My wife and kids . " <p> Well . It never in a billion years occurred to me that Buck might have : A. a wife , B. kids , and C. stashed them away in some other city , which I suddenly realize I 'm not even sure what state its in . Nevada ? But after a million-dollar question like , What 's in Albuquerque ? you sure as hell do n't follow up with , Is it in Nevada ? <p> That night I go stand behind Em and rub her shoulders while she types : last name , first name , middle initial , and like it 's something that just came into my head , I say , " What state is Albuquerque in ? " <p> She does n't even have to stop typing : home address , home phone . " New Mexico . " <p> Oh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looks at me then looks back : work address , work phone . " hot . Dry . Senior citizens . " Social security number . Policy number . She shrugs , and under my hands I can feel the little bones shifting in the little wings of her back , and suddenly I 'm thinking of sweet , fat Annabelle eating her dinner all alone again while her socalled boyfriend is at the Crazy Eights , out on Milwaukee Boulevard . I put my arms around Em from behind , and then I have this image of Em at work , Jonis , the red-eyed pug tied to the filing cabinet , and evil Sandra coming to Em 's desk with the next two-foot-high stack of casualty reports . And poor , smart , beautiful Em is like Cinderella , and evil Sandra is like the wicked stepmother and wicked stepsisters all rolled into one because there is n't anybody else in their office-fromhell , even though for the past six years Sandras been saying she 's going to get a new girl . That and a computer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Em has to stand up and go to the glass front door if she even wants to see out of their dog-smelling , hermetically sealed , cinder block cube , and then she gets a view of the parking lot and cars zooming by on 217 , plus Sleep Country Mattress , Acapulco Gold 's , Newport Bay , The Top Hat , Fred Meier , PETCO , and BaskinRobbins . Meanwhile , back at home I put my face into her soft hair and close my eyes and think , Maybe we should move to Albuquerque . <p> And she says , " I think Perry said that 's where his people are from . " <p> The Navahos . <p> I drop my hands , go sit in my plastic lawn chair . " Perry , " I say . <p> She 's typing : scene of accident . I 've helped her type them , even though I have to use two fingers . " Yes , " she says . " Perry " <p> And I stand up , about to do my stroll to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked ! " <p> The thing about old Perry , his one special power , is if you say his name out loud , you can bet lunch money that he 'll be showing up at the door . Sure enough , four days after that conversation I 'm doing my big Monday morning sleep-in and somebody 's banging on the bedroom window-not the front door , like a normal person . I know who it is ; I make the name into a groan . I consider playing dead , but he might try to break in . So I haul out of bed and go see . It 's so cold outside his face looks bloodshot . I can see nicotine stains all over his teeth where it looks like they broke in half and he glued them together . <p> " Hey Perry . " <p> " Hey , hey , hey , " he says , hopping up and down , eyes spinning . <p> " She 's at work , " I say . " It 's Monday . " <p> He looks at me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he tries to get himself under control and goes , " Ohhhh ... " Then he says , " Hey , can I come in ? I 'm freezing my balls off . " <p> I 'm doomed to let him in eventually , so I do n't put up a struggle . " So , Perry ! " I say , trying to move things along . " So , Perry , what 's up ? " <p> He brushes some of his wispy hair out of his face-there is n't enough of it to stay back in the ponytail holder . " You got any smokes , man ? " <p> Smokes . " No , man , " I say . " What 's up ? " <p> He looks around our living room like he 's trying to decide whether he wants to buy our place or not . " I got a deal going , dude . A big one . Can I sit down ? " <p> He always tries this on me . As soon as Em 's at work , he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to go to the store , " I say . I 'm like that ; I can lie on the spot if I have to-no thinking , it 's just right there . " I 've got to get something . " <p> " Cool , " he says , shrugging . I realize that , slippery-shrewd trickster that I consider myself , I 've just sealed my fate . " Well , let me put on a shirt or something , " I say . <p> He follows me to the bedroom , so I have to shut the door right in his face . But he just stands on the other side of the door and hollers , " I got a deal going ! It 's massive ! You want in , man ? " <p> " No ! " <p> " I know this guy in New Jersey ! He 's got , like , a hundred garbage bags of toke he wants to move ! All I have to do is give him $300 and we 're all millionaires ! " <p> I open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have like , $260 ? " <p> I stop and look at him . " Do I look like I 've got $260 , man ? " It 's true-I forgot to pay the gas bill again and got one of those shut-off warnings that I had to hide from Em . They let me pay half this month , which leaves me $12 until payday . <p> But Perry studies me like he can actually tell if someone 's got $260 . Then he says , " C'm on , dude , this is a sure thing . " <p> We go out the front door while I 'm still pulling on my jacket . The screen door bangs shut and I make mental note five million and three to fix it . <p> I start out booking it with Perry three steps behind me , complaining about , dude , why ca n't we take the Hyundai , etc . A lousy five-block walk to the Stop ' n ' Rob . " Dude , you need the exercise , " I say . <p> This calms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . But the wind is trifling with his nonexistent hair , which he 's trying to hold down on his head with both hands so he looks like he 's in a state of shock . " So how 's old Em ? " he says . That 's what they call each other : Old Em and Old Perry . <p> None of your business is what I want to say . But I have this defective be-nice gene from my mom and instead say , " She 's hunky-dory , Perry . " <p> " She 's a nice girl , " he says in this wistful voice that I 've heard once or twice before . Like , for a split second Perry can remember his name and a few other pertinent facts , and he realizes the miracle of someone like Em agreeing to marry someone like him , even for eleven months . That always kills me , that stupid , sad Perry voice , and I end up buying him his damn cigarettes and a chocolate MoonPie , and he does n't even notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get back there 's a note stuck in the screen door from Em 's father Casper-do n't ask me how he got such a name . Anyway , the note says , " Fix the door , " and then under that it says , " What have you done with my daughter , W.K. ? " White Kid . That 's Casper 's little idea of a joke . He owns the house and lets us rent it for the same as his mortgage , which is about zero , so I 'm supposedly in charge of keeping it from crumbling into dust . I 'm so grateful that Perry made me miss Casper that I agree to let him spend the night on our couch . <p> That afternoon Perry and I go on to play approximately three thousand games of checkers on the living room floor . If you 'd told me before that anyone over the age of five could be bad at checkers , I would 've said not possible . But I triple- and quadruple-jump Perry across the board , and he takes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slips the comb into his back pocket , all the time staring at the board like he 's trying to set it on fire . I let myself sit there on the living room floor playing checkers with a mental defective , I guess , because it was better than thinking about how I still had n't fixed the screen door or the gutters or the washing machine that we had n't even finished paying on-or thinking about how this was a short weekend and that in thirty-six or so hours I 'd be back in the Fab , watching an annealer . <p> When Em got home , she had her usual face of total exhaustion with two dark stripes , one under each eye . I wished I had the power to just disintegrate Perry on the spot . But she looked at us and then she got this sweet , horrible expression on her face like , aw , my two men . <p> On Tuesday , after yet another three thousand games of checkers , during which he 's shown no improvement , and another night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IC-land and there 's a memo from High Command . The memo is from Hank Williams-yes , that 's the Fab manager 's name , Hank Williams , and no jokes , no renditions of " Hey Good Lookin ' , " or you get an incident report and docked one hour of pay . The memo from Hank Williams says , From now on , no more sleeping in cars during breaks . At any given moment you can walk through the vast IC parking lot and see guys parked everywhere slumped over their steering wheels like the dead on the battlefield . No one who works here-except Harris-can get used to our insane hours , so napping in cars is our main form of recreation . <p> Ha Ling comes charging out of Photo waving this memo at me . He 's got four little kids at home . He 's a big car sleeper . " No man ! " he says . " Wont do this thing ! " He looks crazed . In Photo , the rooms are flooded with orange light , and Ha Ling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that orange and prevent him from going insane . And the emergency chemical showers are supposed to stop the hydrofluoric acid from eating straight to your bone marrow , too . <p> This day , however , I 've got bigger fish to fry , something I 've been pondering the whole time driving to work that morning . I 'm in search of Buck . <p> Sure enough , he 's in the break room , eating Pop Tarts from the vending machine and reading the sports section from one of the ten million gutted newspapers lying around . There 's a few other guys in there , but Buck is by himself . I sit down across from him and he does n't even look up . <p> I lead in by talking about this and that , how Ha Ling 's all exercised about the memo , how I almost got taken out by a Tron in a Lexus SUV on the way in to work , blah blah . Finally , I come out with it . " You 're a married man , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not answer . " So I was thinking , you 'd be a good one to ask . " Is my voice shaking ? I clear my throat and try to get a grip . " Buck , " I finally say to his head behind the paper , " do you think-should I ask Em to marry me ? I mean , even if I ca n't afford a ring ? " Buck looks up , real slowly , from his sports page . He looks at me . He raises his eyebrows . He goes back to his sports page . <p> That 's it ? That 's all I get ? An eyebrow raise ? After all those discussions about Albuquerque and him blabbing about his wife and kids to Troy ? I get up with as much dignity as I can and walk out past all the other guys . <p> When I get back to Thin Films , though , Harris is waiting for me . Even though he 's all suited up , he 's easy to spot , being six foot four . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . How 'd he already hear about it ? " Why are n't you asking me , man ? I thought I 'm you 're friend . What for you 're asking that Buck ? " <p> I 'm sort of touched he says this , and then when I think about it , I 'm sort of embarrassed , because he 's right , not to mention the reason why I 'm asking Buck is so lame and sad . <p> " It 's because-you know , " I mumble . <p> " No man , what ? " <p> " He's- " Harris scrunches and I lower my voice and say it right into his hooded ear , " An Ind-Native American " <p> " A native what now ? " Harris reels back to his full Ethiopian height . " Buck , man , is Mexican . " <p> " He is ? " I look back toward the break room . He is ? <p> " What the hell wrong wit you , man , anyway ? " Now his accent is pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Em girl to marry you ? You must be thinking that the beautiful girls , they grow on tree branches . " Harris points to a scrubber like it 's got branches . He shakes his head . " I be disgusted wit you , man . How long you have that beautiful girl wit you ? " <p> " Um . " I stare at my tennis shoes . " Bout four years or so . " <p> " Bout four years . Bout four years " Harris announces to the Fab at large now . Sure enough , Gregor comes scuttling over , attracted by any unusual noise . " Damn , " he says in his lame Russian way so it sounds like deeum . " What goes on here ? " <p> " But I ca n't afford a ring , " I say to Harris in this voice that is so pathetic and whiny that it 's like I farted . <p> Harris is cranked up ; he 's on a roll . He waves his arms around . " Four years you been talking bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only known him for three and a half . " You be thinkin that Em 's wantin to marry that ring , maybe ? No , boy , she is not . She is not interested in no idiot ring . That beautiful girl of yours , she waitin on you , man , and you alone . And if you do n't know how to have such a beautiful thing-if you not enough man yet to say this girl mine , then best you cut her loose , let her go and have her happiness . Because I tell you this , there are plenty men , plenty men , who know how to love a beautiful girl , and they are ready to do it right now ! " <p> Then Gregor tries to butt in with his Russian philosophies of life , but I walk away , the cogs in my head turning . <p> We 're not supposed to use the Fab Room computer terminals to get online , but naturally everybody does . I go to the terminal by the annealer and click straight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then it all goes : all those beautiful Tibor reels , the Abels , the Sages , the lightweight Scott rods that wick soft as willow branches , and the steelhead rods that feel so solid in your hands , the sturdy felt-bottomed boots and the high-tech GORE-TEX waders , all of it . I describe each piece in loving detail , write the words over and over : seldom used , or almost new , or even still in box . My prices are fair , excellent , in fact . I list my number at work . Then I sit back and try to stop hyperventilating . <p> I drive home in the seven o'clock traffic-two separate Asian guys in Lexuses cut me off and I do n't care . I do n't even remember that I 'm not supposed to notice if someone is an Asian driver . I get home and Em is typing forms , Perry sleeping on the couch . <p> Seven days later I have turned about 6,000 dollars ' worth of prime fly-fishing equipment into 2,721 bucks . The only equipment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bamboo rod . I put all those personal checks and curling-up tens and twenties into my wallet , toss the picture of Ring **26;2245;TOOLONG , and I drive to Davisson 's Jewelers . The ninety-two-year-old woman behind the counter named Meerna has rings on every finger plus long curving dragon-lady nails-one with its very own diamond stuck to it . She does n't seem to expect me to buy anything for $7,500 , though , and just seems kind of tickled that we get up into the thousands at all . She tries on every ring I look at , waving her wicked-looking fingers around . Finally we pick out a three-quarter carat solitaire , marquise cut , on a platinum band , $2,699 . No sales tax in Oregon . <p> With the remaining $22,1 take Perry and myself out for a beer or two , which seems to make him as happy as if I 'd given him the $260.1 tell him that his work here is done , it 's time for him to leave the couch and return to his spaceship . <p> That night when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too damn hokey for me to even try , so instead I just sit her on the couch . I look at her and she starts crying before I even get the box out of my pocket . <p> So now I 'm The Old Married Guy . Casper calls me that . Everyone at IC comes into the Fab and says , How 's The Old Married Guy ? and slaps me on the back like I 've aged two thousand years . At least that 's what they 're doing this week since we 're back from our honeymoon in Bend . I just smile and say fine . We 're saving to buy a house , and I keep checking eBay for deals on fly rods . <p> And yesterday Harris tells me that while I was honeymooning , Buck quit . Or more exactly , he went on his vacation and never came back . I was in awe . " Why did n't he come back ? " I ask Harris . " Is he going to stay in Albuquerque ? " <p> 40,000 watts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell that Buck does anything ? " <p> But I think about Buck the whole ride home on 26 , and I know why he did it : because he missed his wife and kids . I know this sure as I know why I try to beat the traffic home every night , which is as likely to happen as me walking on water . <p> We old married guys are just built that way . <p> Author Affiliation
