What , No Roses ? By Marianne Mancusi Dorchester Publishing Marianne Mancusi " I ca n't be the only one in the goddamned city who 's too stressed for sex ! " I sucked down the remainder of my chocolate brownie frappuccino , struggling with a stubborn chunk caught in the straw . Finally I gave up on the last smidgen of chocolate ( a total crime against humanity , I know ! ) and set the cup down , letting out my most frustrated sigh . " I 'm sure you 're not , " my photographer Jenny replied with a laugh . The pretty 22-year-old brunette reached over and patted my hand . " But who wants to admit it on local TV news ? " " Right . " I stared out into the crowd of people milling about the Fashion Valley mall . We 'd scoured the area for hours that morning , asking the inane " Man on the Street " question for my six p.m. news story on the subject . A fascinating feature on a new scientific study that found eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their partners because of work pressures . Eighty percent claimed they were literally " too stressed for sex . " Problem was , zero percent wanted to go on camera and tell me about it . " Besides , it 's not that you 're too stressed for sex , " Jenny added with a twinkle in her sparkling blue eyes . " It 's just that you only want to have it with a guy you refuse to talk to . " I groaned . Not this again . Itconstantly amazed me how even after nearly a year , Jenny still rooted for " Nick the Prick " and I to get back together . I should have never told her my " We 'll always have Baghdad " romance on that oh-so-boring eight hour stakeout we 'd been on when I first came back to California . ( No , not that kind of stakeout . No lurking criminals or bad guys . Angelina Jolie had been rumored to be staying at the Four Seasons , if you must know . ) Ever since that day , Jenny had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how much I protested that I would never , ever speak to that asshole as long as we both shall live , my words fell on naively deaf ears . In her yet-to-be-scarred mind , our relationship was beautiful , broken , and just dying to be mended . With her help , evidently . Sigh . She was as bad as Nick 's geeky brother Tom . The dot.com billionaire who Forbes claimed was busy revolutionizing cyberspace seemed to have a lot of free time on his hands , trying everything under the sun to get Nick and I back together . He claimed his brother deserved a second chance and nothing I said or did could dissuade him . But hey , the two of them could hold out hope ' til Judgment Day for all I cared . After what Nick did to me last Valentine 's Day halfway around the world , I 'd sooner run away and join the circus rather than speak to him again . And that was coming from someone with major clown phobia . Jenny grabbed her video camera as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to work . " You know , maybe you should call him sometime , " she said , oh so casually . " See how he 's doing up there in the City of Angels , all by his lonesome . " She grinned . " Or maybe I should . I mean , he is really hot and all . " I rolled my eyes and play swatted her with the mic . " Your pathetic attempts to stir me to a jealous rage are completely in vain , " I informed her . " If I 've told you once , I 've told you a thousand times . Nick and I are through . Forever . Finito . End of story . " " Bah , " Jenny scoffed , shaking her head . " Have it your way . It 's none of my business anyway , right ? I 'll just shut up and take the pictures . " Grr . Great . Now she was going to go all sensitive on me . I drew in a breath and reached over to pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you 're trying to help . But you do n't know the whole story . What Nick did to me Valentine 's Day last year-it was unforgivable . And not a day goes by when it does n't hurt . " I glanced down at the ugly scar on my forearm and thought about the one I could n't see , running down the side of my face . It was amazing the station hired me to be on air-me channeling the Phantom of the Opera and all . Yup , it still hurt all right . Maybe not physically . But the mental pain . The fear . Stuff I knew would never completely go away . Not that I was n't trying to move on . After all , I 'd left Iraq-quitting my high profile career as a foreign correspondent to take on the most innocuous , non-dangerous reporting job on the planet ( albeit the cheesiest ) . I spent the last year healing . Living one day at a time . Creating a life for myself . One without fear and danger and heartbreak at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty proud I 'd gotten as far as I had . Not that I did n't have a long way to go . Seeing Nick again would just hurl me backwards . And I could n't afford that . I just was n't that strong yet . I might never be . " Okay , okay , I get yah , " Jenny agreed , punching me lightly on the arm . Luckily she knew when to quit . " Let 's go find some under-sexed San Diegans . " I smiled and together we walked down the open air corridor of the Southern California mall where a good number of people were wandering about , carrying big bags of stuff they 'd accumulated in their afternoon of shopping hedonism . Unfortunately , no one looked particularly interested in wasting five minutes of their life to get their fifteen seconds of local news fame by exploiting the secrets of their sex lives . ( Or in this case lack of sex lives , which technically was worse . ) No one , that was , until an elderly woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Can you interview me ? " she asked , leaning on her knobby cane . " I want to be on television . " Hm . I gave her the once-over . It was funny how some people were dying to be on television , while others avoided it like a Ben Affleck/J-Lo movie . ( If I was n't a reporter , I 'd so be in the second category ! ) Of course , granny here was n't our target demographic-at News 9 we only cared about the sex lives of 25-49 year old women with a lot of disposable income-but it was nearly three p.m. and I was getting desperate . " Okay , " I said , giving her Big Reporter Smile . I pointed the microphone at her . " Do you ever feel you 're too stressed for sex ? " She stared at me a moment , her wizened blue eyes wide , as if in shock at my brazen question . I felt my face heat . Of course . What was I thinking ? Granny probably had n't gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever since her precious Wilber died back when Reagan was President . Sigh . Too bad my story was n't " Too Senile for Sex . " " Too stressed for sex ? " the old woman repeated , following the phrase with a tinkly laugh that sounded a little like Christmas bells . " My goodness , no . In fact , ever since I started using this female Viagra I got off the Internet , I 've been having multiple orgasms at the drop of a hat . Henry loves it ! " She beamed at me and then turned to look directly into the camera . " My sex life is great ! " she informed the lens . Hmph . Evidently these days even Granny was getting more action than me . I did n't know whether to laugh or cry . " Okay , " I said , lowering the microphone . She obviously was n't going to help with my story . " I appreciate you taking the time to answer . " Not that you gave us anything we could use , my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look over her bifocals . " You young people , " she scolded . " You need to stop working so hard . Start enjoying life . When you 're on your deathbed , you wo n't look back on your life and think , ' Why did n't I work more ? ' Trust me . But you might wonder why you did n't have more orgasms . " Ah . Even better . Not only was Granny boinking like a bunny , she was now offering up life lessons . Next thing you knew , Jenny was going to tell her the Nick story and the two of them would be tag-teaming for a sex-filled reconciliation . Can we say , no thank you ? " Thanks , " I muttered , stepping backwards to put as much distance as possible between me and the hot flash ho . " Now if you 'll excuse us ... " " Good luck , Sweetie , " she said , then smiled a patronizing smile . " You 'll find your Prince Charming eventually . " I swallowed hard and resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him . And that when I kissed him , he 'd turned into a total frog . I wanted to insist that relationships-while perhaps good for short term , crazy , hot sex-always ended in pain . Leaving you vulnerable and wounded and crying in your tomato alphabet soup . Alone . Instead I channeled Self Protective Mode and turned to throw Jenny a smirk as Granny hobbled away . " Some people ! " Jenny shrugged . " She does have a point , Dora . " " Oh , do n't start . " I groaned . The last thing I needed was a lecture on relationships from an inexperienced twenty-two year old . The girl had been dating her boyfriend since the high school prom . She had no idea what was in store for her future love life . Jenny opened her mouth to speak , then looked behind me , and closed it again . I whirled around to see what caught her attention and actually achieved the nearly impossible task of shutting her up , crossing my fingers it was a 25-49 year old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing with her hubby . Instead , my eyes fell upon a very tall man , dressed entirely in black , standing before me , arms crossed against his broad chest . He had mirrored shades , slicked black hair , and a shiny Rolex that peeked out from under his suit coat 's sleeve . The whole look screamed " Men in Black . " " Yes ? " I asked , donning Indulgent Reporter Smile . He was probably from mall security and was about to ask us to leave the premises before he called the cops . Could this day get any worse ? " Dora Duncan ? " he asked in a clipped accent I did n't recognize . " Are you Dora Duncan ? " I felt my face heat into a blush . Not a security guard . Maybe even a fan ! A real life fan ! I always got a kick out of people recognizing me on the street . Of course , back in the old days when Nick and I rocked Iraq , this was a more regular occurrence . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . And now , only a year after escaping the network to take this silly features reporter job in San Diego where I was sure not to run face to face into a semi-automatic machine gun , nobody even knew my name . Nick , on the other hand , was still uber famous . In fact , I did n't understand how any normal human being could manage to garner such a fan base without selling his soul to the devil . ( Which , of course , I would n't put past him . ) After leaving Baghdad and taking a job as a network news anchor in Los Angeles , he 'd become more famous than ever . While I labored in local news obscurity , he walked the red carpet , schmoozing with starlets . While I covered craft fairs and dog shows , he interviewed senators and got laws changed . While I lived my life scarred and ugly because of his mistake , he made People Magazine 's 50 Most Beautiful People . And Jenny wondered why I would n't take him back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand outstretched and I should be shaking it . Had to be gracious to the few fans I had left . " Yes . Hi . How nice to meet you , " I said with a smile . I wondered if my hair was covering my scar . I hated that I always wondered that when meeting someone new , but I could n't help it . " I 'm Special Agent Fredricks , " he said in response , reaching into his back pocket and pulling out a badge , encased in smooth black leather . He flashed it at me , and I raised an eyebrow . Not a fan . FBI . Figured . " We need your assistance , and I 've been asked to have you come with me . " I furrowed my brows . The FBI needed my assistance ? My assistance ? " What could you possibly need my assistance for ? " I blurted out and then regretted a moment later . After all , I did n't want to come off as rude and uncooperative to the FBI . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tossing a glance at Jenny . " Now if you could just come with me ... " I looked over at my photographer , then back to the man , trying to decide what I should do . I had a story to get on the air in a few hours . A story I was n't exactly making much progress on . If I took time out to go with this man , I 'd never make my slot . But he was FBI . I could n't say no to the FBI , could I ? Plus , what if it was an important story he needed my assistance with ? What if it were an inside scoop on a huge scandal ? Even though I 'd taken this job to get away from the danger I 'd faced in Iraq , truth be told lately I was getting a bit sick of covering sex and cellulite and celebrity c-sections for the evening news . " Uh , let me call the desk . See if it 's okay . " The assignment desk was the den mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with them , I could be in big trouble . I reached into my purse to dig out my phone . The agent placed a hand over mine . " No need , Ms. Duncan , " he said . " We 've already called your station . That 's how we knew where you were . " " Oh . " I looked over at Jenny . Should I believe this guy ? " We talked to a man named Mario . Your news director . He said he could move your story to the eleven p.m. news so you 'd have time to finish it after we met with you . " I raised an eyebrow . Wow . Guess even my boss Mario was impressed that I 'd been called upon by the FBI . Usually the guy would n't pull a story even as a personal favor to the Pope . Go figure . " It will only take a few minutes , Ms. Duncan , " assured the agent . " Then we can return you here for your story . " " Go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang here . Go pick out a few thongs at Vicky Secrets . After all , Robbie 's coming over tonight . " " Uh , great . A bit TMI , but great . " I suppressed a shudder , then turned back to Special Agent Fredricks . " Fine , fine . Lead the way . " I followed him out of the mall and into the parking lot , where a shiny black car with heavily tinted windows sat idling by the curb . A chauffeur type stepped up to open the back seat door and I ducked down to crawl inside . FBI Man entered after me and soon we were speeding away from the mall . " Where are we going ? " I asked . " Headquarters , " Fredricks replied not-so-informatively . " And what is it you need my help with again ? " " It will all be explained to you in due time , Ms. Duncan . " Of course it would be . I leaned back , settling into the plush leather seat . Might as well relax for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the day to make my news slot after this inopportune field trip . Still , my pulse thrummed with anticipation . Relaxation was never my forte . About ten minutes later , the car slowed to a stop and the chauffeur opened the door . I crawled out , looking around at my surroundings . We were in an underground parking garage . Agent Fredricks stepped out beside me and gestured for me to follow him . Soon we were walking down a featureless corridor , flanked with even more featureless silver doors . It did n't look like anything I 'd imagined the FBI offices would look like . Not that my job had ever taken me anywhere higher up than the local police barracks . Curiouser and curiouser , as Alice would say . Of course , my brain decided to take that instant to remind me that I had n't really checked this man 's ID all that closely . What if he was lying about being part of the FBI ? About speaking to Mario ? What if he was really part of some secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year ? What if I 'd walked right into their trap ? I felt the all-too-familiar wave of panic rise like bile in my throat and attempted the breathing exercises the shrink had taught me to prevent yet another full-on panic attack . Oh Dora , how do you get yourself into these messes ? I squeezed my hands into fists and struggled to regain control of my rebellious wildly beating heart . Being scared would n't help me escape if I needed to . Besides , I was being completely irrational . Why would the Iraqi group be looking for me . Ridiculous . " Here we are , " Fredricks announced , interrupting my racing thoughts . He slid a card key into a slot by one of the nondescript doors . It looked exactly like the other thirty some-odd doors we 'd passed and I wondered how he kept track . The LCD light above the slot turned green and the door slid open , revealing a circular windowless conference room with a large mahogany table at its center . Sitting at the table were three more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mirrored shades . Which was odd , considering we were deep underground and the lighting did n't exactly lend itself to sunglasses . This was beginning to get super freaky . If they started introducing me to any aliens like they did with Will Smith , I was so out of there . " Sit , Ms. Duncan , " said Man in Black #1 . I pulled out a chair and did as he requested . After all , what choice did I have ? Sure , I knew Tae Kwon Do , but it did n't seem quite plausible that I 'd be able to kick four men 's asses all at once . Especially ones who appeared to be Platinum members in good standing at their local gyms . ( Continues ... ) by Marianne Mancusi
