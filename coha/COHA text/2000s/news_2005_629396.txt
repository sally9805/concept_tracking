<p> The references to moonlit bayous , twittering mockingbirds and the lazy Mississippi may sound sappy . But for the hundreds of thousands of people driven from their homes by Hurricane Katrina , the old jazz standard 's central question - " Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans ? " - is achingly real . <p> More than three months after the storm blasted the Crescent City , vast areas remain a ruined , uninhabitable ghost town . Among evacuees shunted from shelters to hotels to , with luck , government-provided apartments , anger and activism have grown over how and by whom the city will be rebuilt . Above it all hovers the primal question of when , or if , to return . <p> Vincent Wilson , a **34;6621;TOOLONG , would rebuild his 9th Ward home of 38 years immediately - but only if he 's sure it 's safe . He does n't know when that will be . <p> Schoolteacher Kemberly Samuels feels the same way . But returning to her home in the upper 9th Ward is even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that later was designated an EPA Superfund site , and she worries that flooding led to its recontamination . <p> Sabrina Heins , a former prep cook , planned to return but then decided to stay in Houston . <p> Darcy Scoggin , a social worker , planned to stay in Houston but has decided to go back to New Orleans . <p> " In some ways , life in Houston is so much better , " Scoggin said . " We could make three times as much money . My husband , a musician , could get more gigs ; as a social worker , there would n't be as many people paying on a sliding scale ; our son could get a great education . <p> " But then you feel the pull . It 's the pull of where you went to pre-K . Where you first kissed your boyfriend when you were 13 . It 's about who played swords with you when you were a kid . You would be leaving all of that . " <p> To date , a fraction of Katrina 's evacuees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to homes in the French Quarter , Garden District , Algiers or other high-ground areas along the Mississippi 's natural levee . By some estimates , twice as many New Orleanians now live in the Houston area as in their hometown . <p> On Saturday , hundreds of displaced residents living in Houston will return to New Orleans to protest government policies they say make returning to their old homes difficult . <p> More than 200 are expected to join a bus caravan organized by longtime New Orleans activist Malcolm Suber , who says blacks have been excluded from planning their city 's rebirth . A second protest to take complaints to elected officials was planned for Saturday by The Metropolitan Organization , a Houston social reform group . <p> Wilson , an organizer for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , noted that acrimony has grown among evacuees , some of whom are convinced that levees protecting lower-income black neighborhoods were sabotaged to spare affluent white areas . <p> Wilson said he and other 9th Ward residents seethe at suggestions that their stricken , low-lying neighborhoods should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand Saturday for a town hall meeting at the George R. Brown Convention Center to protest redevelopment plans being considered by New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin 's Bring New Orleans Back Commission . <p> " We are not buying into the propaganda that our city in its whole entirety can not be rebuilt , " Wilson said . " We see Oakland , Calif. , and San Francisco being rebuilt ( after earthquakes ) . Every year Florida is hit by a hurricane , and it 's up and running . If that can be done in other places , why not New Orleans ? It does n't matter if we 're below sea level if the levees are built properly . " <p> Seeking assurances <p> Like Scoggin , Wilson has experienced the call of home . <p> " There is nothing like home , " Wilson said , " and I want to go home . " <p> Wilson said his brick ranch-style house on Lamanche Street has been owned by his family since it was built in 1967 . Prior to the storm , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their teenage son , Zanthony . <p> " We 're on a nice quiet , quaint block , " Wilson said . " Everyone on our street for two blocks is a homeowner . ... It 's the type of neighborhood where people say good morning ' or good night . ' If you do n't greet people on the street , they 'll recognize you as a stranger . " <p> Key to returning , though , are assurances the revamped levee system will be able to withstand a major hurricane , he said . <p> " Our house was totally inundated , " he said . " It was listed as a total loss and has to be demolished . Our position now is that we 're not going to rebuild on our land until ... some viable plan has been implemented . " <p> For Samuels , the decision to eventually return to New Orleans was complicated by her home 's proximity to the Agriculture Street landfill . Opened more than 90 years ago , the dump , later converted to a landfill operation , continued accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-1960s . <p> Concerns about the site 's environmental integrity grew in the 1970s as houses , a school and other buildings were erected on its perimeter . The designation of the landfill as a Superfund site - the area had extraordinarily high soil lead content - led to protracted wrangling among the Environmental Protection Agency , the city and area residents . <p> Ultimately , topsoil was removed from developed areas and an impermeable barrier put in place . EPA spokeswoman Lisa Fasano said 74 samples taken from the Katrina-flooded former landfill seem to indicate that the area has not been recontaminated with lead . However , she said , monitoring is continuing , and it is n't known when the area might be deemed safe for habitation . <p> Samuels , a public school teacher , said she and her husband moved into their four-bedroom brick house 24 years ago . Their two children were reared there . <p> " When we went back ( after the hurricane ) it looked like a bomb had exploded , " Samuels said . " We were very unprepared for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only 2 feet of water in the area . That was so totally wrong . We ended up having 4 1/2 feet of water . Everything was topsy-turvy , covered with mold . We lost everything . " <p> Samuels said her family quickly learned " the insurance companies were playing hardball and we did n't have very good coverage . What they 're paying us for flood damage wo n't build the house back . " <p> Still , Samuels said , both she and her husband , a maintenance supervisor , are near retirement and eager to return to New Orleans . <p> Decisions sometimes are not so clear cut . <p> Like others interviewed for this report , Heins , mother of two teenage daughters , one of whom is autistic , and a teenage son who suffers from cerebral palsy , professed a deep love of her hometown . <p> " It has a great heritage , " she said . " It has great cooking ; it has gospel roots . " <p> But , she added , " At first I wanted to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think New Orleans is a safe place to go back to . " <p> Heins , a widow who worked as a prep cook at a Shoney 's restaurant and at a U-Haul storage facility , had occupied her upstairs apartment in New Orleans East for two years when disaster struck . <p> After about four days in the flooded house , the family was transported to a makeshift shelter at the University of New Orleans . Four days later , they were moved to a holding area on a New Orleans freeway . Finally , after almost two weeks , she was taken to a shelter in Houston . <p> A religious woman , Heins has found a position at a Houston church and plans to enroll in theology classes and find a job . <p> " I love New Orleans , and I wish it the best , " she said , " but as far as our well-being , I think we 're better off here . ... The kids are stable now . Why take them to an unstable situation ? By staying I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm believer in education . " <p> Evacuating hurricane-threatened New Orleans was a continuum of misery . And although the flight of Scoggin 's family was not as harrowing as Heins ' , it still was touched with tragedy . As the extended family made the seemingly endless drive from Louisiana to the Dallas-area community of Colleyville , an aged uncle sickened with pneumonia . He died days later in a Colleyville hospital . <p> Exhausted from the ordeal , Scoggin , her husband and their college-age daughter and young son arrived in Houston during the Labor Day weekend , finding their first lodging in a crowded hotel room . <p> But they quickly were welcomed into the community . Lodging was provided by a River Oaks couple with Louisiana State University connections . Scoggin 's son , Guy , was accepted into the eighth grade of an elite private school . The family was swept into a whirl of social activity . <p> Houston , she said , " embraced us . " <p> Seeing new opportunities <p> New Orleans provided a stark contrast . <p> While Scoggin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high winds played havoc with the roof . On her first visit to her hometown , Scoggin was profoundly disheartened . Making her way past guard stations and flooded streets , she found the welcoming canopy of live oaks on St. Charles Avenue stripped of leaves , the denuded branches resembling witches ' fingers silhouetted against an ashen sky . <p> " It was scary , scary , scary and so sad , " she recalled . <p> Struck by the observation that New Orleanians had grown lackadaisical and accepting of mediocrity , Scoggin found Houston 's sophistication and quality of life alluring . New Orleans , she worried , had been reduced to a toxic landscape , one that might prove hazardous for her family to inhabit . <p> Still , once she got out of " survivalist mode , " the need to return became clear . <p> " Even if this life in Houston provides more opportunity , " she said , " I want to go back . It will be like living in a pioneer village . ... To have our kids there . Not turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabulous learning experience . " <p> Scoggin 's son recently journeyed to New Orleans to help clean up the Audubon Zoo . <p> The family will return for keeps when school recesses for the holidays . <p> " It 's daunting , " she said , " and you 're exhausted when you see what needs to be done . But then you start doing - sweeping , pulling limbs out of the gutters . Even the smallest sign of progress makes you mentally happy . When we see those street cars rolling again , we will be given a greater appreciation of what we have - and of what we have lost . <p> " We 'll have the opportunity to see it more alive than it was before . We 'll become more sensitive to it all . Yes , it will be daunting . But what is your life ? This is your life .
