He holds all the records , world and Olympic . He is a 28-time World Cup winner . He has won Olympic gold twice and silver once , and is a gold-medal contender in Sydney . He has been the master of his discipline for 15 years . Yet he 's unknown  --  for it 's the fate of rapid-fire pistol shooters not to make it into the spotlight but to disappear , as their bullets must , into a dark circle . <P> He is Ralf Schumann . A mild-tempered and obviously sharp-eyed man of 38 , he was born in the former East Germany , where he took up pistol shooting at age 15 . The pistol has since become an extension of his right arm , and rapid-fire shooting at 25 m his life . He fires 20,000 shots a year  --  all in training for a competition that lasts no longer than 72 sec . <P> " The thrill of those 72 seconds is the challenge of technical perfection , " Schumann says . Shooting is not about the one perfect shot but about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aiming for the maximum of 600 rings . The world record , set by Schumann in 1995 , is 597 , a figure that has been equaled  --  by him . Shooters are " mistake collectors , " he explains . " Every hit besides the bull 's eye is irretrievably lost . " <P> Why he collects many fewer mistakes than his rivals he ca n't explain . He mentions better nerves , good concentration , light weight training and stamina , which he gets from jogging with his wife Anke , also a shooter . " The better your stamina is , the easier you can compensate the adrenaline output , to quiet your pulse and breath , " he notes . A shooter must get rid of the adrenaline with almost no movement . Schumann had a lot of adrenaline to get rid of during a 2 1/2-year winning streak that ended in 1997 . " Do n't remind me of that drama , " he sighs . " Every competition was like starting at the Olympics . " <P> Schumann works as a mechanic  --  a precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western part of Germany . His boss sponsors him by giving him three months off at full salary every year  --  six months during Olympic years . At his prior job with a weapons importer , Schumann designed his own .22-cal. pistol , which is manufactured by the Italian company Pardini . Quite a few of his competitors now use it as well . <P> One of those is his countryman Daniel Leonhard , 27 , who bested Schumann for the German championship in August . " Sydney will be tough , " says Schumann . And after Sydney , will he be ready to give up the pressure ? He notes only that " Ragnar Skanaker from Sweden won bronze in Barcelona . " Skanaker was 58 , so Schumann may have quite a few more Olympics in his sights .
