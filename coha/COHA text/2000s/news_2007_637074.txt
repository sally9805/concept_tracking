<p> New York  --  In an era of YouTube and broadband and iPods , Chris Williams of Atlanta 's " Project 9-6-1 " WKLS station knows good old-fashioned radio is n't so old-fashioned anymore . <p> After a dozen years as a program director , Williams has gone from running a single alternative rock format to a multimedia menu : two distinct digital radio channels on air and online , thousands of music videos on the Web , on-demand performer interviews and shows just for MySpace users . <p> " Each different outlet gives us a new way to entertain , " Williams said . " It 's forced us to stop thinking of ourselves as an FM radio station and more as an audio content provider . " <p> The changes recall the early days of FM half a century ago , Williams said , describing a renewed " pioneering spirit . " <p> Many in radio feel the same excitement as the granddaddy of wireless technologies catches up to the digital age . Adapting to new ways of delivering radio will be a major theme at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Our paradigm has completely shifted , " said Tom Poleman , who oversees programming for six New York stations owned by Clear Channel Broadcasting Inc. , the nation 's largest station owner . " When I first got into radio you would go five or 10 years between significant developments . Now it 's a matter of months . " <p> But the rapid change also brings growing pains , and radio 's revolution has lately become especially rocky . <p> Proponents of Internet radio say a March decision on music royalties could cripple their emerging medium within weeks . The proposed merger of the two satellite radio firms has raised questions about that business and highlighted divisions among broadcasters . And with iPods and other gadgets occupying more consumers , over-the-air radio is pushing to make listeners notice its own digital makeover . <p> " These are pretty challenging times , " said Dan Halyburton , an Emmis Communications Corp . senior vice president who oversees three Manhattan stations . <p> He said financial resources may be scarce as broadcasters rush to embrace digital and invest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the best with your core operation , but you try to move into these new areas , " he said . <p> The online dial <p> One frontier is Internet radio . People connect with computers or wireless gadgets to listen to original Web-only programs and rebroadcasts of over-the-air and satellite radio . <p> About 30 million people , or 12 percent of teens and adults , listen to online radio at least once a week , according to a 2006 study by Arbitron Inc. and Edison Media Research . The proportion rises to 1 in 5 among young adults . <p> More recent data suggest the numbers are even higher . An updated Arbitron/Edison study is expected next week . <p> Much online listening appears to happen at work and does not steal from traditional radio audiences , said Diane Williams , Arbitron 's product manager for custom research . She said the online audience , which was at 8 percent between 2003 and 2005 , seems to grow along with the spread of broadband connections . <p> There are at least tens of thousands of Webcasters , Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online firms say the blossoming Internet radio world is in jeopardy . <p> They have challenged a Copyright Royalty Board decision that increases the amount they must pay song labels and performers for online music broadcasts . Webcasters pay these fees on top of the royalties to music publishers and composers that broadcasters pay . <p> If the royalty decision goes into effect without change , on May 15 " Webcasters have a potentially very , very large bill " that could include more than a year 's worth of retroactive payments , said Jonathan Potter , executive director of the Digital Media Association . <p> " The impact will be relatively sudden and across the board , " Potter said . <p> He said small and medium-sized Webcasters could be put out of business , while bigger networks from companies such as Yahoo and AOL will " see an immediate reduction in investment and innovation . " <p> SoundExchange , which collects the royalties for record companies and artists , says performers and labels deserve the compensation , and Internet radio will still prosper under the new rates . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles , Chicago and Austin , Texas , has stayed out of Webcasting because of the royalty requirements , Halyburton said . <p> Satellite 's shuffle <p> XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio also sell digital programming to online audiences , but lately the nation 's only two satellite radio firms have been focused on getting closer to each other . After losing money during years of competition , the companies in February proposed merging . <p> Satellite radio is still in " search of a magic bullet " to speed growth , said Sean Ross , vice president of music and programming at Edison Media Research . He said offering scores of channels , sports broadcasts and personalities such as Howard Stern has " grown satellite radio but obviously not grown it fast enough . " <p> A merger was forbidden when the companies received licenses in the 1990s , but their executives say the game has changed with new competition from Internet radio , portable music players and new digital radio technology . A tough government regulatory review lies ahead . <p> Sirius Chief Executive Mel Karmazin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million subscribers , has told lawmakers that the deal will not hurt consumers by raising costs or reducing choices . <p> Consumer groups and many broadcasters disagree . <p> " It defies the law of logic to suggest that a monopoly , government-sanctioned merger would be of benefit to consumers , " said Dennis Wharton , a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters . <p> The merger has also raised questions about whether subscription satellite radio , which XM and Sirius sell for about $13 a month , is a viable business model , said Ron Simon , curator at New York 's Museum of Television and Radio . He said the business may just need time so consumers can adjust to new media options . <p> Radio 2.0 <p> An even newer technology is HD Radio , which sends digital signals bundled with traditional analog broadcasts . The technology can deliver sound quality as good as a CD and lets stations broadcast multiple channels . <p> More than 1,200 of the nation 's more than 12,000 radio stations have upgraded to the technology and reach about 85 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of digital broadcasters is growing , few people have the special receivers needed to hear the result , said Jeff Jury , chief operating officer of iBiquity Digital Corp. , which developed the technology . <p> " There 's definitely a ' chicken and the egg ' scenario , " Jury said . " Consumers wo n't buy the radios unless they know there 's something to listen to . " <p> Hundreds of thousands of receivers have been sold , and the audience is expected to reach 1 million this year , Jury said . He said mobile HD Radio devices should go on sale in 2008 , expanding the market and potentially bringing the technology to gadgets such as cellphones or M players . <p> Last month , Wal-Mart Stores Inc. began selling a $190 car radio that receives the digital signals . More big retailers should follow with HD Radio products this year , Jury said . <p> Carmakers BMW , Hyundai and Jaguar say they will offer the radios as an option . Six more car brands are to join them soon , Jury said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply a brand name , and not short for " high definition " as with television  --  with satellite radio or are unwilling to pay so much for a receiver .
