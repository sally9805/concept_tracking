<p> TUCSON  --  Like so many other spa workshops , Lana Holstein and David Taylor 's program at Canyon Ranch kicks off with a breathing exercise . <p> " Close your eyes , " says Taylor , speaking soothingly to the 13 couples sitting barefoot in a circle . " Feel the energy , the prana , move down through your body . " <p> Taylor pauses . The room grows quiet . " Now feel the energy move down into your chest . " Pause . " And now into the belly . " Pause . " And now farther . " Pause . <p> " Into the groin . " <p> A few eyes open . Eyebrows raise . <p> The groin ? <p> This is definitely not your mother 's spa . Dubbed " Sex : Body &; Soul , " the four-day retreat at this famous health resort on the edge of the Sonoran desert is one where " breathing through the groin " is just a warm-up . By week 's end , the couples will have soaked up lessons ranging from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner with intravenous medicine ) to the best ways to slather each other with massage oil ( wear nothing but towels for this group activity , please ) . Not to mention the daily " homework " assignments ( hint : Taylor will hand out Viagra ) . <p> " This is a pretty intensive program , " Taylor warns , adding that at times it can be quite embarrassing . " But the more you put into the circle , the more you 'll take away . " <p> Spas have rolled out an ever-expanding array of over-the-top offerings in the past decade , from underwater massage to chocolate wraps . But the latest trend is surely the hottest : sex-education courses . <p> With competition growing ever fiercer ( the number of spas in the USA has nearly doubled since 1999 ) , some of the most mainstream health resorts are dipping a pedicured toe into the once-taboo waters of sexuality , adding everything from weekly lectures to multi-night packages on the subject . <p> Do n't snicker . The programs , popping up from California 's Oaks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tastefully mild to the downright explicit . But they all grapple with serious issues that are increasingly important to that core group of spa customers : baby boomers . Issues such as waning desire , boredom , menopausal changes , dysfunction and the realities of life with and after kids . <p> Not to mention , ahem , the basics . " I 'm always amazed at how little people know about sex , " says Holstein , a physician turned sex expert who runs Canyon Ranch 's women 's health department . " It 's everywhere in our culture . You ca n't watch an evening of television without seeing lots of sexual innuendo . But when it comes down to knowing what to do , there are a lot of misconceptions out there . " <p> Holstein 's program , and others like it , promise to clear up those misconceptions and then some . We checked in to find out how . <p> Day 1 <p> Slurp . Slurp . Slurp . <p> The quiet of the morning is broken by a slobbering sound . The sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ourselves that we 're completely unaware of , " Taylor explains to his students , who again sit in a circle , this time ( per his orders ) smooching as hard and passionately as they can . " The tensions interfere with our experience . " <p> Tensions , indeed . The participants , who range from their 30s to 50s , are fumbling badly . Despite signing up for a program with " sex " in the title , it seems many did n't realize they 'd be playing out their passions in public . <p> " If I had known we were going to do some of the things we 're doing , I do n't think I would have come , " confides Julie Wylie , a golf course owner from Albuquerque . <p> Wylie , 41 , and husband/golf course co-owner Patrick , 43 , are typical of the couples here . They 've been married for years , and they say they 're happy together . But they have extremely busy lives that sometimes do n't allow them to spend enough time together  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the couples in the program , they have kids at home that seem to consume every waking hour . ) And though they say there is n't anything particularly wrong with their sex life , they thought the program would help bring them closer . <p> At the least , they would pick up some new tricks . " Our kids are growing up , and we have to look ahead to when the kids are gone , " says Patrick . " We want to have the highest-quality marriage we can . " <p> When it comes to tricks , he 's in for quite a treat . Today 's main topic is the woman in all her splendor , and Holstein leaves no appendage unturned . She begins by whipping out " Mona , " a large yellow and purple puppet of the female genitalia  --  or yoni , as we learn to call it  --  and launches into an exhaustive anatomy lesson . She also talks about everything from estrogen and testosterone , both crucial to a healthy female sex life , to the difference between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , code for a product the FDA tested you-know-where ) . <p> It 's the first of many franker-than-frank talks . Much to Wylie and others ' relief , this is n't a program where couples get naked together on the floor for hands-on learning . A big part of it is discussing the issues . And , if anything , it 's more about what goes on in the couple 's heads than their bed . <p> " We 're asking people to ask themselves what it means to make love , " says Holstein , who is married to Taylor . <p> Which brings us to the day 's " homework " : bringing out the woman 's radiance . This is n't a tantric workshop , but like many new spa programs , there is much borrowed from Eastern religion . Taylor briefs the men on such things as shakti , a woman 's " goddess energy . " Then they 're sent to their rooms for a tantra-inspired , female-focused escapade that starts with a warm bath . One rule : no male-pleasing hanky-panky . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it , " says one of the men . " She starts with a warm bath ; I end with a cold shower . " <p> Day 2 <p> Clearly , the first homework assignment went swimmingly . The women beam . The men swagger . The group is much more open . <p> Which is good , because today 's topic is one that most men rarely discuss in mixed company : their own sexuality . This time , it 's Taylor 's turn for an anatomy lesson . <p> " Male anatomy perhaps is not such a mystery , " he deadpans at the start . <p> Yet it turns out there is quite a bit to learn . Pointing to a larger-than-life male organ projected on the wall , Taylor discusses everything from the stages of sexual arousal ( there are four , he says ) to physiological and psychological reasons behind male sexual problems . <p> The talk draws plenty of inquisitive questions from the women  --  and the men . <p> " I 'm amazed that we can share like this in the group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . " It 's wonderful . " <p> One of the points of such workshops is to get people talking about their problems and to hear about other people 's problems . <p> " It 's one of the last taboos in polite conversation , " Holstein says . " Certainly our culture is not very open about sexuality , in contrast to the Europeans . " <p> The workshop and others like it are designed as a risk-free forum where they can finally bring it up . Participants go by first names and agree to confidentiality . " There 's a certain amount of anonymity , " she says . <p> Holstein , a noted sex expert and author of How to Have Magnificent Sex : 7 Dimensions of a Vital Sexual Connection ( Harmony Books , $ 21 ) , spends lots of time with the group discussing the different aspects of a loving relationship . <p> All seven of Holstein 's " dimensions of sexuality " are drawn into the daily homework . Today , the assignment focuses on the men . After some group pelvis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Holstein and Taylor send the couples back to their rooms for another tantra-inspired interlude . This time , the women run the show . <p> Day 3 <p> Taking it Home : Creating Exceptional Sex in Ordinary Life . <p> That 's the lofty title of today 's lesson , and it starts with Holstein asking each couple to draw up a " contract " in which they promise to initiate sex a specific number of times a week . Speaking in business terms is a key part of Holstein 's approach because many of her clients hail from the business world . <p> " You need a vision statement , " she says . <p> Some of the couples in the group acknowledge they 've drifted apart emotionally , and thus sexually , as their kids , work and home duties left them less time for each other . The contract is a way to force a reconnection . <p> Holstein advises the couples to transform their bedrooms into a sacred space . " A lot of our bedrooms look like the family room , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's really not a place to make love . " She doles out more advice : Cultivate an attitude of curiosity about your partner ; let go of the need to always win the argument ; practice building a sexual charge ; see their radiance . <p> " They 've given us a lot of tools to take home , " Julie Wylie says . <p> By the end of the program , many of the participants say they are surprised by how much closer they have grown to their partners  --  and how much beyond just sex the course offered . <p> " The big surprise for me was that I thought I was coming to a sex course and it turned out to be more about my heart and my relationship , " says Lucy Atkins , a writer living in Seattle . <p> Atkins , who left two young kids behind to join her Microsoft-employed husband at the program , says it should be mandatory for all couples .
