The colorful misbehavior of college students trumps considerations of college students ' relationships with their families . With broad coverage of behaviors such as binge drinking , on-line gambling , and risky sexual behavior , the image of the college student is one of a person worrying about what time the bar opens , rather than problems at home . This image may be a myth , just as believing a parent who drinks too much on a given evening forgets about his or her family problems is a myth . Understanding the role of family influence on college students expands the view of the concerns of college students . This study will identify problems facing college students ' families today . Literature Review <p> Family influence on college students <p> Despite publicity suggesting parents no longer are connected to their young adult children , parents continue to have an influence on their college-age children ( Booth-Butterfield &; Sidelinger , 1998 ; Wilks , 1986 ) . Family interaction patterns are a factor in children 's subsequent behaviors ( Booth-Butterfield &; Sidelinger , 1998 ) . Psychologically healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Monks , Wolfe , &; Thomas , 1994 ) . <p> College students pay attention to what is happening with their families . While they are experimenting with a variety of behaviors , college students are still communicating with their family members and learning the status of lingering issues . The ready availability of email and dominance of cell phones has made that communication easier and more frequent . <p> Family Problems <p> Communication behaviors play a key role in diffusing distress . Linker , Stolberg , and Green ( 1999 ) found that when parents communicate effectively during a divorce , children experience fewer behavioral problems . Daily communication , or everyday talk , between children and noncustodial parents has been found to be a significant factor in maintaining a close relationship after a divorce ( Afifi &; Kieth , 2004 ) . <p> The identification of family problems is fundamental to resolving them . Problem identification gives a common understanding of the problem to each family member . Identifying and analyzing the sources of family stress has been a dominant research theme ( Rollins , Garrison , &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) note , however , that shared family perceptions do not mean that every member of the family responds the same way to a stressor . An understanding of family problems from the perspective of the young adult son or daughter is lacking . Thus , the following research question merits further investigation : <p> RQ1 : What problems do college students identify as affecting their families ? Method <p> Participants <p> Participants in this study attended a medium sized Midwestern university ( N = 156 ) . The average age of the child participant was 21 , with a range from 18 years to 45 years old . Participants indicated having a wide range of siblings . From the sample , 58 participants ( 37.2% ) indicated having one sibling , 53 participants ( 34.0% ) had two siblings , and the remaining participants indicated a range of zero to eleven siblings. ( n1 ) <p> From the sample , 134 individuals ( 85.9% ) did not live at home with their parents . Additionally , 105 respondents ( 67.6% ) had a job at the time of the survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ( SD = 9.49 ) with a range of 5 to 56 hours. ( n2 ) Procedure <p> Students from a variety of classes were asked to complete an open-ended survey during their class session . The surveys were distributed in the summer and fall semesters of 2004 . Five individuals transcribed the survey responses . The survey instrument consisted of a section on demographics and eleven open-ended questions . The open-ended questions asked what the participants identified as problems , what they would classify as the most significant problem , why this was the most significant problem , what they wished they could do about the problem , what they would do about the problem , a story of a time a problem was resolved , and any viable solutions for the problem . <p> Before each survey was coded for themes , the research team read through all of the responses and determined six major themes as family problems : money issues , communication problems , health issues , quality time , life transitions , and daily hassles ( see table 1 ) . Participants could provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , participant responses were mutually exclusive , but multiple . <p> Coders were trained and practiced with a sample of 10% of the data . Then , the coders talked through the differences observed and coded another 10% of the data to determine Cohen 's Kappa inter-coder reliability values for each theme . <p> Measures and Analysis <p> After the surveys were collected and transcribed , an inductive thematic analysis was used to identify the prominent themes to the question " What are the worst problems you feel are facing your family at the current time ? " Cohen 's kappa criterion of .80 and above for reliabilities was viewed as acceptable ( Neuendorf , 2002 ) . All of the emerging themes had excellent reliabilities. ( n3 ) Results <p> Six major family problems were identified ; each is detailed below . <p> Money issues . Money was the most common theme , identified by 64 participants ( 42.1% ) . Some of the participants had a defeatist attitude about money : " My family has always faced money problems and probably always will . " Many participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Financial questions regarding how to pay for the needs of everyone . " Participants were also concerned about their parent 's financial situation as they approach retirement and old age : " My dad takes care of all the money ; if something happened to him my morn would n't know what to do . " <p> Communication problems . Communication was the second most common theme identified by 43 respondents ( 28.3% ) . Inability to deal with a life changing event such as divorce caused communication problems : " My parents are divorced . My father just remarried and had a baby . Neither my sister nor I , have much contact with my father , and have never met his wife or baby . " <p> For others , an inability to communicate created a problem in itself : " Not communicating well enough . Nobody can stand to lose an argument or fight in my family and it causes a lot of tension in my family . " Another commented , " One of the main problems that our family faces is our lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's sometimes hard to keep in touch as often as we should . Also , I feel that my parents withhold information from the kids . " <p> Health issues . The third most common problem identified was health , identified by 30 participants ( 19.7% ) . While it was rare for students to report concern over their own health issues , they often reflected concern for others . Comments often referenced their grandparents : " Aging grandparent " and " My grandparents are dying/sick . " Many were concerned about their parents whether it was the potential for sickness such as , " My father 's smoking . " Concern for siblings ' overall health also emerged : " My sister has rheumatoid arthritis so that is always out there . " <p> Quality time . The lack of quality time was the fourth most common problem , identified by 29 individuals ( 19.1% ) . One respondent wrote , " Finding time to sit down on a daily basis and spend time together as a family . " Distance was often reported as a hindrance to quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two older sisters live in California , my twin is 200 miles away and my parents are 300 miles away . " <p> Life transitions . Life transitions were a problem among 24 of the respondents ( 15.8% ) . Death was one transition that students reported dealing with in their family : " I feel that my family is faced with the death of my stepdad . It is really rough at times without my dad being there . " Children seemed particularly attuned to their parents ' struggles . They felt parents might have a difficult time adjusting to children leaving home . They were also worried about issues related to aging : " Mother is going through midlife crisis to try and find out what it is she likes . She spends thousands of dollars on hobbies she really shows no interest in . " <p> Daily hassles . Daily hassles were a problem for 14 participants ( 9.2% ) . Hassles included work around the house to siblings . One student stated , " My sister dating " while another remarked , " My brother just got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now the biggest problem facing our family is that our basement just flooded . Also we may squabble over who has to do what chore around the house . " Stepping on each others ' toes can also become a daily hassle . For example , " Space at my mom 's is becoming an issue . My two stepbrothers and I live in a small room , and my sister sleeps on a futon . " Discussion <p> Whether they are thinking about their parents ' health , or the decisions their siblings are making , the results of the current investigation support that students definitely have more on their mind than their own enjoyment . Because the questions were open-ended , participants had the opportunity to report several problems . Several respondents reported two problems , and some reported experiencing three . <p> The multiple problems can be illustrated : " My mother is facing charges of embezzling $50,000 from a former employer . She will probably go to jail . My father is mentally ill. " and " Mother is a single parent , she has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will live on when she retires . I , too , am now a single parent . I am concerned about providing for myself and my son , raising him in a nation that is not very stable . " Several stressors can lead to a pile-up of stress ( McCubbin , Cauble , &; Patterson , 1982 ) . <p> The issue of money as the top family problem was not surprising given the current state of the economy . The financial challenges facing American families include unemployment and low wages . The Bureau of Labor Statistics ( 2004 ) has noted that 6.1 million families had at least one member unemployed during an average week of 2003 . Wage growth for hourly workers was essentially flat for the month of November 2004 ( Bernstein , 2004 ) . This dismal economic picture , combined with double-digit tuition increases across the country , contributes to stress for families , including adults and adult children . <p> The impact of communication as a problem is intriguing because it can also serve as a solution . While divorce and abuse were identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the issue . The following comment is exemplary : " My dad needs a new kidney , he lives alone , my mom and dad want to get a divorce , my sister is leaving for the army . We fight all of the time . " The participant is clearly upset about all of the factors leading up to the conflict , but they view the fighting as the chief problem . Implications <p> Our public education system requires children to take classes to learn about math , reading , writing , science , and even physical education . These classes are required for a very good reason ; they are necessary life skills that are not instinctive , rather , they need to be honed . We do our children a disservice , then , when we deprive them of education about arguably the most important skill they will need : communication . Results of this study demonstrate a need for a separate communication class that would focus on topics such as conflict management , problem-solving , persuasion , and interpersonal communication . Limitations <p> This study identifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not demonstrate how those problems affect their classroom performance or the quality of their daily life . We can not assume that the problems identified are equally felt by all of the participants . The seriousness of the problem to the individual student remains unknown . Future Research <p> College students ' perceptions and experiences are important , but sometimes overlooked . Family communication as a research area has blossomed , but this study identifies opportunities for further growth . While traumatic family problems such as the impact of terminal illness , and daily stressors , such as running late for work have been explored , little research on enduring , basic family issues such as those identified by the participants in this study have been conducted . Knowing more about how family problems affect college students could offer insight into designing effective counseling and outreach programs intended to increase college student retention . Having a clearer picture of the problems college students face would be an asset for all who interact with them . Footnotes <p> ( n1 ) One participant did not respond to this question or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) For participants who provided a range of hours , the average of the range was recorded . For example , an individual reporting 25-30 hours a week would be recoded as working 27.5 hours a week . <p> ( n3 ) The Cohen 's Kappa intercoder reliability for the theme of money issues and for the theme of communication problems were each .92 ; for the themes of health issues , quality time , life transitions , and dailly hassles were each 1.00 .
