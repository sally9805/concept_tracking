Frank Coffin 's office was windowless and cramped , hidden away in the darkest corner of the Town Hall basement , next to the boiler room . A fat sewage pipe ran the width of the ceiling ; now and then a drop or two of ominous fluid plunked onto whatever paperwork lay strewn across Coffin 's desktop : condensation , he hoped . In the old days , when his uncle Rudy was chief of police , Coffin 's office had been on the third floor . Small but sunlit , the upstairs office had high ceilings and two tall windows that looked out on the harbor . Then Rudy was forced to resign amid allegations of bribery and extortion , and when the new chief , Preston Boyle , arrived in May , his first official act had been to move Coffin into the basement . Nothing personal , Boyle had said . Coffin had been a cop for a long time : fourteen years in the Baltimore City Police Department-including nine in the homicide division-and eight years as Provincetown 's first and only police detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office amounted to a demotion . Coffin 's intercom buzzed . It was Jeff Skillings , the day 's desk officer . " Lady to see you , Frank . Says her husband 's missing . " Melinda Merkin was a small woman with an unusually large head . Shewore a lime green pantsuit . A diamond of at least two carats sparked on her left hand . Her hair was brown with frosted highlights and wispy bangs-a style , Coffin thought , directly out of the early eighties . She wore black sunglasses , which she took off as soon as she sat down . Her eyes were dark and tired and bulged like a terrier 's . Her eyebrows appeared to have been painted on . Skillings handed Coffin a manila folder as he showed her in . " Good gravy , what a mess , " she said , when Skillings was gone . She dabbed at her eyes and nose with a shredded Kleenex . " If this gets in the papers , it 'll just be the end of us . " " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wrote the word Merkin on the manila folder , then circled it . He looked inside . It contained a photograph of a man dressed in a blue suit , a small gold cross pinned to one lapel . A banner hung against a wall in the background . It read 1999 bible baptist conv --  . The rest of the word was out of the frame . " My husband is Ron Merkin , " the woman said . " The Reverend Ron Merkin . We 're on TV in thirty-seven states . If this gets out , the show 's over , Rover . " Coffin leaned back in his chair . He 'd seen Reverend Ron on TV once or twice while channel-surfing ; he remembered a sweaty , angry man with white froth in the corners of his mouth . Merkin had built a large national following by showing up at gay bars , pride rallies , even the funerals of AIDS victims , followers in tow , chanting antigay slogans and brandishing crudely lettered signs that read like fourth-grade hate mail . Coffin suddenly felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this odd woman and her accompanying cloud of perfume : lily of the valley , maybe ; something floral and heavy . " Reverend Ron , " he said , tapping his pencil on the desk . " He 's the God Hates Fags guy , right ? " " Lord , no-Ronnie 's thing is God Hates Homos . God Hates Fags belongs to someone else-it 's trademarked . We 'd be drowning in deep doo-doo if we tried to use that . " Coffin opened the folder , took out the photo , and placed it on his desk . " So , if you do n't mind my asking , " Coffin said , " what 's your business in Provincetown ? Performing a little missionary work among the heathen ? " " Look , Detective- " She stopped , hesitated for a moment . " I collect ceramic figurines . " Coffin tried to interrupt , but she held up a shushing finger . " Dog figurines , Detective . Mostly porcelain and china . Every shape and size , every breed , from every country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting them for thirty years . Everywhere you look in my house , you 're looking at dog figurines . I mean , I 've got thousands , literally . I could n't stop collecting now if I tried , and even if I could stop collecting them , I would n't want to , you know what I mean ? " She held up the finger again . " My husband , bless his heart , does not understand my thing for dog figurines . I 'm sure there are moments when he wishes every surface in his house did not have a half-dozen china pooches sitting on it . I 'm sure , Detective , that there are times when that poor man is sick to death of the whole shooting match . But does he criticize ? Does he complain ? Not very blessed much , I 'm here to tell you . We all have our stuff , Detective . I 've got mine , he 's got his ; dollars to doughnuts you 've got yours . " She opened her bag , extracted a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Coffin . It showed the same beefy man , standing in what looked like a motel room . He wore beige pumps-big ones-and a calf-length navy blue dress with a white Peter Pan collar . Coffin could n't suppress a sharp bark of laughter . He looked up at Mrs. Merkin . " Sorry , " he said . " That was taken last winter , " she said . " Key West . " Coffin looked at the picture again . The big man seemed to be trying to straighten his wig , which was greenish-blond and looked as rumpled and forlorn as road kill . Drag queens he could understand , sort of ; there was something tongue-in-cheek about the whole thing , all that glitter and flash , a kind of burlesque-on/homage-to the whole idea of glamour in all its blowzy , tittering goofiness . The straight cross-dressers were harder to figure out-the just plain transvestites everyone in town called tall ships . The tall ships tended to be large men who strode up and down Commercial Street in plus-sized tweed skirts , support hose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and five o'clock shadows poking through pancake makeup . Sometimes they had their wives , even their kids in tow . They reminded Coffin of his Aunt Connie after she 'd been through several rounds of chemotherapy . " So , can you tell me what happened last night ? " Coffin asked . She nodded . " He got all fixed up and said he was going out to walk around , do n't wait up . That was around ten o'clock . I woke up a few times in the night , expecting him to be there , but he was n't . " " He got dressed up and went out to walk around by himself ? " " As far as I know , yes . " " Was that unusual ? " Melinda Merkin smiled a little with the left side of her mouth . " Well , not for Ronnie . He likes to be seen , without people knowing who he is . He likes that a lot . " " Does your husband drink ? " Coffin asked . " He gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Any drug use that you know of ? " " No . He 's never messed with any of that stuff . " Coffin hesitated . " Does your husband have affairs ? One-night stands ? " Melinda Merkin furrowed her painted brows ; deciding how much of the truth to tell , Coffin guessed . " I guess a lot of men struggle with the lust thing at some point in their lives , " she said , " but Ronnie 's mellowed out in the last few years . He was n't exactly Casanova to begin with . " Coffin placed the two photos side by side and looked at them closely . " Does your husband sleep with men , Mrs. Merkin ? " " No ! Good Lord . Just because a man likes to wear a dress every now and then does n't make him queer . " Coffin raised his eyebrows . " Did you two have an argument or anything last night , before he . . . ? " She dabbed at her eyes again ; the Kleenex was smeared with mascara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this business to fight about much of anything anymore , Detective . I 'm not exactly jumping for joy , but I 'm doing my best to deal with it , because I love my husband . " Coffin slid the photos into the manila folder , along with his notes . " Mrs. Merkin , " he said , " odds are your husband will turn up in the next few days . We get one or two cases like this every year-it 's easy for out-of-towners to get swept up in things around here-but we have n't permanently lost a husband yet . " Mrs. Merkin looked him straight in the eye . " He 's a good man , you know . He takes good care of me and our children . He 's not some pervert-he 's a good , steady , God-fearing man , except for this one thing . " " Yes , ma'am , " Coffin said . " No one 's suggesting otherwise . " He waited a beat . " We 'll ask around as discreetly as we can . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ? The one in the dress ? " " Maybe we 'd better hold on to it for now , if this is how he 's likely to appear . We 'll keep it safe . " Mrs. Merkin sighed . " It 's his sisters ' fault , " she said . " They used to dress him up like Tinker Bell when he was little . " Later , briefing the night shift in the cramped squad room , Coffin handed out color Xeroxes of both photos of Ron Merkin . Jeff Skillings , Lola Winters , and Coffin 's cousin Tony were full-time , year-round officers ; four part-time summer cops were also present . Everyone chuckled at the picture of the big man in the blue dress . " What 's that on his head ? " Tony said . " I think it 's a marmot , " said one of the summer cops . " Please keep an eye out for this gentleman , " Coffin said . " His name is Ron Merkin . He did n't come home last night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning . " Ron Merkin ? " he said . " Not the Reverend Ron Merkin ? " " That 's right , " Coffin said . " Do not discuss Mr. Merkin 's appearance in this photo with anyone outside the department , especially the news media . No matter how tempting it might be . " Then Chief Boyle took over the meeting . He was small and red-faced and wore his hair combed over a speckled bald spot . Four months ago , Boyle had been deputy police chief in Ashtabula , Ohio . He was , according to the Ashtabula PD , an excellent administrator , scrupulously honest , a man who believed in doing things under budget and by the book . In a press release , Provincetown 's Board of Selectmen had described him as " the perfect candidate . " He was the exact opposite of Coffin 's uncle Rudy . " For the past several years , " he began , eyebrows bristling , " the PPD has turned a blind eye to drug use and public indecency among the gay community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not patrol the gay clubs hoping to bust ecstasy dealers , nor did they harass the men who frequented the darker shadows of the town beach at night . Coffin 's uncle Rudy had believed that there was no percentage in pissing off the gay community , a stand with which the selectpersons , most of whom were merchants or bar owners or guest-house proprietors or owners of significant real estate or otherwise invested in the town 's economic health , wholeheartedly agreed . " Starting tonight , " Boyle continued , " that 's going to change . Tonight , at 0230 hours , we will conduct a raid on Havemeyer 's Wharf . " Coffin groaned . His cousin Tony turned to one of the summer cops . " The dick dock , " he whispered loudly . Boyle held up a warning forefinger . " Residents have complained . The situation has gotten out of control . I was hired to keep the peace and ensure public safety , and that 's what I intend to do . " The dick dock poked into the harbor like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottages . It was one of Provincetown 's busiest late-night trysting places ; during the peak summer months , on warm nights , dozens of gay men gathered on the beach beneath the spindly pier , where many indulged in anonymous sex , paired off or in groups . Even a year or two ago , Coffin could not have imagined the residents of those cottages objecting ; in the " old " days , people had rented there precisely because they wanted to be part of the scene . Now that the Havemeyer cottages had all been condoized and were selling for ten times Coffin 's annual salary , the new , wealthy residents were apparently not amused by the dick dock 's nocturnal mating ritual . Boyle waved a handful of plastic handcuffs . " Everyone make sure you 've got plenty of twisties . Make sure you wear gloves . Watch out for needles , in the sand and in pockets . And be aware that drug possession counts on this one : If they 're holding , they 're busted . " Coffin raised his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's women-only hot tub night at the Spinnaker Inn , " he said . " Are we planning to raid them , too ? " Boyle 's brows bristled and twitched . " We 're talking about public indecency , Coffin , " he said . " Lewd conduct . You ca n't just go down to the beach and do the funky monkey anytime you want . No particular group of people in this town is above the law . No matter what your uncle the shakedown artist thought . " " Good for us , sir , " said Jeff Skillings , face completely deadpan . Skillings had been on the force for fifteen years and had lived openly with his partner , Mark , a manager at Fishermen 's Bank , for five . " What 's that , Skillings ? " Boyle said . " Stamping out indecency and all , sir-it 's about time . " One of the summer cops squirmed in his seat . " Uh , Chief ? " he said , raising his hand . " What is it , Pinsky ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if somebody resists arrest ? Just nightsticks ? Or can we take the tasers along , just in case ? " " Too bad we do n't have bullwhips , " Skillings said , still straight-faced . The summer cops nodded . Coffin laughed . " You got something else to say , Coffin ? " " Just laughing , Chief , " Coffin said . " Well , stop it . " Coffin 's shift was over ; when he got home , he would make a couple of calls . News of the impending raid would travel fast .
