Chapter One Maud When the message came and I saw it was from Edward , I nearly choked on my plum cake . It could only mean that my sister was dead . I had not seen her since her wedding day , three long years before . An occasion for rejoicing  --  that 's what you 're imagining , is it not ? A beautiful bride , a blushing groom , flowers , and music , and bright new beginnings ? It 's a sweet picture , but that is not how it was , not for Catherine , anyway . Oh , she did look a perfect angel in her delicate gown of robin's-egg blue , her hair cascading down her shoulders , shining like the finest gold . And there were flowers aplenty , and music , too , and a sumptuous feast that lasted well into the night . Father wanted nothing but the best for her , you see . But as for the bright new beginnings  --  well , that 's another story . You 'll notice I have n't yet mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd man , arrogant and proud . But I thought such traits to be common among the nobility . I knew little of such things , being born to the merchant class . And so I would have taken his peculiar and unfriendly ways as natural to his station in life  --  if it had n't been for the way he looked at me . There was such coldness in those eyes , such a hardness near tohatred , that it positively made me tremble , and I could not help but turn away . I remember thinking , when first he pierced me with that terrible gaze , that Edward of Burning Wood was not altogether right in his mind . He was no proper husband for my sister , of that I was sure  --  and I told Father so . " Catherine is rich , " I said , " and beautiful besides  --  she does not need to settle for such a man . " " Settle ? " Father said . He was astonished , for he considered it a splendid match . " What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shall make our Catherine a lady . Just think of it , Maud  --  and she only a glass merchant 's daughter ! " " A glass merchant 's daughter with a fortune , Father , do n't forget that . " ( I knew , and Father knew , and surely even Catherine knew that Edward was marrying her for her money . ) " I would far rather she remain a common lass than be raised to the nobility and be miserable all her life ! " " But why should she be miserable ? " Father countered . " Can you not see how the man dotes upon her ? " This was true enough ; Edward did seem besotted with my sister , for all that he wed her for gain . Yet even in this he was extreme and unnatural  --  for his was a wild , possessive , fanatical love . Catherine was flattered by it , of course . Moreover , she thought him handsome and admired his confidence and manly bearing . And so , as both Father and Catherine seemed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts to myself and say no more against the man . After the wedding  --  indeed , the very next day  --  it became clear that I had greatly underestimated Edward : he was far , far worse than even I had believed him to be ! For once he was in possession of both Catherine and her dowry , he turned his back on us , forbidding my sister to ever see us again ! Can you imagine such a thing ? Why , it nearly put poor Father in his grave . Indeed , it was at about that time that his mind began to wander and he became childlike in his ways , as the old are sometimes wont to do . But I believe it was the loss of Catherine that caused him to decline  --  that and the guilt he felt over giving her in marriage to such a terrible man . And perhaps his infirmity was a blessing of sorts , for as I opened Edward 's letter now , I took some small comfort from the knowledge that , however dreadful its contents might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scanned the message quickly , searching it for words such as dead or death  --  but they were nowhere in evidence . I am a poor reader , I confess , and tears blurred my sight . Also , Edward 's script was cramped and small and difficult to make out . But I struggled through it , word by word , until at last I reached the heart of the letter and  --  what joy !  --  discovered that my sister was not dead , not in the least ! She was about to give birth to her first child  --  and I had not even known she was expecting ! I squinted now , concentrating hard in my eagerness to learn what more the letter might tell me . I could not imagine that Edward had written me out of courtesy , even at such a time . And of course I was right ; he wanted something . He wanted me to go there  --  to that house he had bought with my father 's money , to which we had never once been invited  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her labor ! He said he did not like the looks of the midwife . He is afraid , I thought , afraid for Catherine 's life  --  for indeed , she was always a delicate creature and had never been strong . Now he feared to lose her , and he was so desperate that he had even stooped to asking me for help . Well . I would do it for Catherine . I would gladly suffer his haughty pride and sharp tongue for her sake . And a new babe  --  oh , how the prospect stirred my spirit ! I would go at once ! And so I wrapped up well against the cold , roused the kitchen maid , and bid her keep an eye on Father ( lest he wake in the darkness and , in his confusion , miss the chamber pot again ) . Then I rode off with the messenger in the direction of my sister 's house . It was full dark by the time I got there . As I mounted the steps , I heard the bells ring for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to bed . But I knewthere would be no rest for me that night .
