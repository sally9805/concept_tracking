From the Wild // // He came out of the night , appearing suddenly in my headlights , a big , golden dog , panting , his front paws tapping the ground in an anxious little dance . Behind him , tall cottonwoods in their April bloom . Behind the grove , the San Juan River , moving quickly , dark and swollen with spring melt . // It was nearly midnight , and we were looking for a place to throw down our sleeping bags before starting our river trip in the morning . Next to me in the cab of the pickup sat Benj Sinclair , at his feet a midden of road-food wrappers smeared with the scent of corn dogs , onion rings , and burritos . Round-cheeked , Buddha-bellied , thirty-nine years old , Benj had spent his early years in the Peace Corps , in West Africa , and had developed a stomach that could digest anything . Behind him in the jump seat was Kim Reynolds , an Outward Bound instructor from Colorado known for her grace in a kayak and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor of a healthy , thirty-two-year-old woman who had sweated in the desert and hadn ? t used deodorant . Like Benj and me , she had eaten a dinner of pizza in Moab , Utah , a hundred miles up the road where we ? d met her . Like us , she gave off the scents of garlic , onions , tomato sauce , basil , oregano , and anchovies. // In the car that pulled up next to us were Pam Weiss and Bennett Austin . They had driven from Jackson Hole , Wyoming , to Moab in their own car , helped us rig the raft and shop for supplies , joined us for pizza , and , like us , wore neither perfume nor cologne . Pam was thirty-six , an Olympic ski racer , and Bennett , twenty-five , was trying to keep up with her . They had recently fallen in love and exuded a mixture of endorphins and pheromones. // People almost never describe other people in these terms  --  noting first their smells  --  for we ? re primarily visual creatures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only really important sense-key for the big , golden dog , doing his little dance in the headlights , was our olfactory signatures , wafting to him as we opened the doors . // It was for this reason  --  smell  --  that I think he trotted directly to my door , leaned his head forward cautiously , and sniffed at my bare thigh . What mix of aromas went up his long snout at that very first moment of our meeting ? What atavistic memories , what possibilities were triggered in his canine worldview as he untangled the mysteries of my sweat ? The big dog  --  now appearing reddish in the interior light of the truck and without a collar  --  took another reflective breath and studied me with excited consideration . Might it have been what I ate , and the subtle residue it left in my pores , that made him so interested in me ? It was the only thing I could see ( note my human use of " see " even while describing an olfactory phenomenon ) that differentiated me from my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed , and was single . I had just turned forty-one , a compact man with chestnut hair and bright brown eyes . But when I ate meat , it was that of wild animals , not domestic ones  --  mostly elk and antelope along with the occasional grouse , duck , goose , and trout mixed in. // Was it their metabolized essence that intrigued him  --  some whiff of what our Paleolithic ancestors had shared ? Smell is our oldest sense . It was the olfactory tissue at the top of our primeval nerve cords that evolved into our cerebral hemispheres , where thought is lodged . Perhaps the dog  --  a being who lived by his nose  --  knew a lot more about our connection than I could possibly imagine . // His deep brown eyes looked at me with luminous appreciation and said , " You need a dog , and I ? m it . " // Unsettled by his uncanny read of me  --  I had been looking for a dog for over a year  --  I gave him a cordial pat and replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he didn ? t move , his eyes still saying , " You need a dog . " // As we got out of the cars and began to unpack our gear , I lost track of him . There was his head , now a tail , there a rufous flank moving among bare legs and sandals . // I threw my pad and bag down on the sand under a cottonwood , slipped into its silky warmth , turned over , and found him digging a nest by my side . Industriously , he scooped out the sand with his front paws , casting it between his hind legs before turning , turning , turning , and settling to face me . In the starlight , I could see one brow go up , the other down . // Of course , " brows " isn ? t really the correct term , since dogs sweat only through their paws and have no need of brows to keep perspiration out of their eyes , as we do . Yet , certain breeds of dogs have darker hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markings , " and he had them . // The Hidatsa , a Native American tribe of the northern Great Plains , believe that these sorts of dogs , whom they call " Four-Eyes , " are especially gentle and have magical powers . Stanley Coren , the astute canine psychologist from the University of British Columbia , has also noted that these " four-eyed " dogs obtained their reputation for psychic powers " because their expressions were easier to read than those of other dogs . The contrasting-colored spots make the movements of the muscles over the eye much more visible . " // In the starlight , the dog lying next to me raised one brow while lowering the other , implying curiosity mixed with concern over whether I ? d let him stay . // " Night , " I said , giving him a pat . Then I closed my eyes . // // When I opened them in the morning , he was still curled in his nest , looking directly at me. // " Hey , " I said . // Up went one brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours , " his eyes said . // I let out a breath , unprepared for how his sweet , faintly hound-dog face  --  going from happiness to concern  --  left a cut under my heart . I had been looking at litters of Samoyeds , balls of white fur with bright black mischievous eyes . The perfect breed for a winter person like myself , I thought . But I couldn ? t quite make myself bring one home . I had also seriously considered Labrador Retrievers , taken by their exuberant personalities and knowing that such a robust , energetic dog could easily share my life in the outdoors as well as be the bird dog I believed I wanted . But no Lab pup had given me that undeniable heart tug that said , " We are a team . " // The right brow of the dog lying by me went down as he held my eye . His left brow went up , implying , " You delayed with good reason . " // " Maybe , " I said , feeling my desire for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said once more to the dog whose eyes coasted across mine , returned , and lingered . He did have the looks of a reddish yellow Lab , I thought , at least from certain angles . // At the sound of my voice , he levered his head under my arm and brought his nose close to mine . Surprisingly , he didn ? t try to lick me in that effusive gesture that many dogs use with someone they perceive as dominant to them , whether it be a person or another dog  --  a relic , some believe , of young wolves soliciting food from their parents and other adult wolves . The adults , not having hands to carry provisions , bring back meat in their stomachs . The pups lick their mouths , and the adults regurgitate the partly digested meat . Pups who eventually become alphas abandon subordinate licking . Lower-ranking wolves continue to display the behavior to higher-ranking wolves , as do a great many domestic dogs to people . This dog ? s self-possession gave me pause . Was he not licking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language  --  both of us being at the same level  --  allow him to feel somewhat of an equal ? He circumspectly smelled my breath , and I , in turn , smelled his . His smelled sweet . // Whatever he smelled on mine , he liked it . " I am yours , " his eyes said again . // Disconcerted by his certainty about me , I got up and moved off . I didn ? t want to abandon my plans for finding a pup who was only six to eight weeks old and whom I could shape to my liking . The dog read my energy and didn ? t follow me . Instead , he went to the others , greeting them with a wagging tail and wide laughs of his toothy mouth . " Good morning , good morning , did you sleep well ? " he seemed to be saying . // But as I organized my gear , I couldn ? t keep my eyes from him . Despite his ribs showing , he appeared fit and strong , and looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair matted with sprigs of grass and twigs . He was maybe fifty-five pounds , not filled out yet , his fox-colored fur hanging in loose folds , waiting for the adult dog that would be . He had a ridge of darker fur along his spine , short golden plumes on the backs of his legs , and a tuxedo-like bib of raised fur on his chest  --  just an outline of it  --  scattered with white flecks . His ears were soft and flannel-like , and hung slightly below the point of his jaw . His nose was lustrous black , he had equally shiny lips , and his teeth gleamed . His tail was large and powerful .
