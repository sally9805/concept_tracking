1 The night my sister went missing , I sat in a back corridor of the police station , staring at a tinted glass window to an inner room . The lights were off in there , and so the window looked like a black screen . I remember how my insides felt as blank as that window . It 's a good thing , that numbness , because it keeps you from spiraling into the black-hole-falling routine . Something 's telling you that you do n't need those panic-stricken thoughts yet . No body had washed up . The police had n't found any blood on the pier near the spot where Casey went over . The gunshot , which had sounded more like a weather-wet firecracker , could not possibly have hit one of Casey 's vital organs . Of course , there are always the thoughts that threaten you -- like how blood in the ocean draws sharks , and how a storm at sea had created endless riptides this week . But thoughts like that bounce in the first hours after your shock . The good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably a better swimmer than I was , even though I was a lifeguard . And I thought of Casey having so many friends . None of our friends had any streak of violence . No one had any reason to hurt her . It had been too dark to see anything but a few clusters of our friends up on the pier in silhouette , and I triedhard not to put anything in my mind that was n't real . The gun had been real , whether I liked it or not . But it was a stupid little collector 's gun , a derringer , or " lady 's pistol , " as my buddies called it , brought to a dune party as a joke . It all seemed surreal now . And all of it smelled of " accident . " Nobody who 'd sneaked up on the old pier with us would intentionally hurt Casey . Nobody . Maybe this was all a big prank that had gone over the top . I thought of Casey painting " drops of blood " out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve friends from a couple of boring classes . Maybe she was holed up on some sailboat in the back bay , laughing her airhead butt off , ignorant that the coast guard and the police were searching the ocean around the pier . I had n't seen or heard much in the light of a half-covered moon -- except I 'd still swear I heard Casey 's laugh , and it was after the little Crack ! I 'd been able to relay all that over the phone to our parents in a miraculous calm . Still , they were scrambling to catch the red-eye back from L.A. , where my dad had been in film negotiations with Paramount . It was the first time one of his novels had been optioned by a movie company -- and the first time our parents had left me and Casey alone overnight since we were fourteen and twelve . I was now seventeen , and I stared at that tinted glass window , seeing Dad 's cockeyed grin in it and hearing his speech about how he trusted a twelve- and a fourteen-year-old home alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had tried to tempt us . " Come on , Kurt . . . maybe I 'll strike it rich finally . You kids need to be there . And you and Casey could do Disneyland , while --  " I had stopped him right there . The " rich " part would have struck me better ten years ago , when I was first getting sick of peanut butter sandwiches for lunch seven days a week . By now I was immune to the midlist author no-frills life , and I started blathering about my job on the beach patrol . I probably could have got time off for a Monday through Thursday -- it 's weekends that are sacred for lifeguards . But my job was a good enough excuse to balk at leaving Mystic in the middle of July . The previous summer Mom and Dad had wanted to take Casey and me to the Greek isles for ten days , after my dad finally got a better-than-average royalty check . My very first thought had been , Can we take friends ? I did n't ask . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that if the Greek isles ca n't tempt a guy away from summer fun ' n ' games , Disneyland surely is n't gon na cut it . Not that fun ' n ' games is anything too awful . I had sworn up and down , while Dad was deciding to let us stay home alone , that we would n't do anything stupid , and I still felt that I had held up my end of that bargain . Mostly . All we 'd done wrong was go to a dune party . My mom and dad would n't object to us going to a house party while they were gone . But a dune party was different . No chance of adults , good chance of a raid by the cops . . . and of course there were always the daredevils , loadies , and lovers who would risk going up on the burned-out old pier . No matter how many times the cops removed the metal climbing spikes from its scorched pilings , more would be found hammered in a week or so later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the least scorched portion of the pier 's planking , because it was fun , because of the horror tales about the place , because most people were partied so loose that if a couple of them fell through and hit the waves , they probably would n't feel it . I guessed we 'd forgotten about the storm at sea and how big the rips were . And I guessed the partying was n't so good , either . But millions of kids party , and hundreds of kids had climbed up on the pier in the past twenty years , weather not a consideration . Their sisters do n't get shot by some dinky " lady 's pistol " and fall into the surf with barely a splash . That was the weirdest . Through the deepest , darkest corners of my memory , I still kept digging for the sound of a splash . I could n't find it . Your numbness , your denial , might make you have a flash of Peter Pan saving Wendy from walking the plank . I conjured up images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Wendy walked the plank , but I could n't find a splash after Casey fell backward . But then , Peter Pan had n't wandered over to the New Jersey barrier islands to catch Casey Carmody midfall off the old fishing pier . That much , you can grasp . The theory of ghosts does n't work well either , suddenly . When my dad was a kid , the old fishing pier , which is actually pretty big , had been turned into The Haunt , an amusement pier with an enormous haunted mansion exhibit at the entrance . It had been a " megaproduction , " as Dad called it , employing half the eighteen-year-olds on the island to dress up like vampires and headless ghouls and jump out at summer tourists and their kids . But The Haunt loomed on the far south end of a barrier island , with only a small toll bridge at the far north end . The island could n't hack the traffic that The Haunt needed to survive . About twenty years ago it went bankrupt , and legend has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's how the fire started . No one really knows for sure . It was n't a good enough story to attract the attention of kids in high school . Sightings of vampires hovering over the burned-out foundation of the haunted house , plus two tales of the suicides off there -- one in the eighties and one in the nineties -- those things drew kids to the place like the moon draws water . But island lore about " sightings of the suicide victims " and " the vampires who made them do it " did n't fit the mood in the police station , where I now found myself .
