Our opening story this month is a somewhat grim look at the near future . It was first published in the March/April 2007 issue of MIT 's Technology Review magazine and it 's still available on their Website , but we thought that most F &SF; readers would appreciate seeing it here . David Marusek has been publishing short fiction since 1993 , mostly in Asimov 's . His short fiction was recently collected in Getting to Know You , which is currently a finalist for the 2007 Quill Award . His first novel , Counting Heads , came out in 2005 to much acclaim . This information can all be found online at www.marusek.com , along with a bit of information about his days as a Homer " spit rat . " A longtime resident of Alaska , Mr. Marusek is currently back in Homer , finishing up his next novel , Mind Over Oship . <p> WE ARRIVED BY RENTAL CAR and parked next to a delivery van in the lot closest to the freeway on-ramp . The van hid us from the security cam atop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being lighter than expected . As we waited , we touched up our disguises . At 09:55 , we left the car singly and proceeded to our target site by separate mall entrances . I rode the escalators to the food court on the third level , while G , C , and B quickly reconned the lower floors , where shops were just opening their grates . I started at the burger stand and ordered a breakfast sandwich . The girl behind the counter was pretty , mid-twenties , talking on her cell . She snapped it shut and asked , without making eye contact , if I wanted something to drink with that . She looked as if she 'd been crying . I said no thanks , and she rang up and assembled my order . As she did so , I ticked off the mental checklist we had memorized : slurring of speech-negative ; loss of balance or coordination - negative . About two dozen data points in all . When my receipt printed out , she tore it off with a deft flick of her wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took , because she said , " I 'm only working here to kill my mother . " I made no reply , as per instructions , and fresh tears welled in her eyes . " Oh , it 's true ! " she declared . " I 'm a spiteful daughter who only lives to torment her mother . I admit - it ! I have a freakin " master 's degree in marketing from NYU , and I was a founding owner of Toodle-Do.biz . I practically ran Toodle-Do from my bedroom . Sixteen hours a day ! But did she care ? No ! She was all , " Why do n't you find a real job ? " She could n't even comprehend what Toodle-Do was . I mean , I could tie her to a chair and put a fucking laptop in her fucking lap and use her own finger to point at the screen , and still she ca n't see it . I mean , what do I have to do ? " Once she was rolling , the young woman 's confession built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us . " I 'll tell you what I did ! I sold my shares in Toodle-Do and took the most demeaning , most mindless " real job " I could find ! " She gestured to take in the whole burger stand . " see that ? " She pointed at the deep-fat fryers , where a pimply boy was racking baskets of fries . " I stand next to boiling grease all day . When I go home , I do n't even have to open my mouth . No way ! It 's in my hair . It 's in my clothes . It 's in my skin . " She raised both wrists to her nose and inhaled . " I smell like a freakin " exhaust fan , and it drives her mad ! Oh , it pushes her right over the edge ! My grandmother died of a stroke when she was only in her fifties , and every night I pray to God to give my mother one too ! " She went on like this , and the fries boy came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd heard enough and took my egg sandwich to the seating area . I spied a middle-aged man in a rumpled suit talking on a cell phone . He had a cup of coffee , so I went over to sit near him . He was so engrossed in his conversation that he did n't notice me eavesdropping . " Uh-huh ... uh-huh , " he said while pushing doughnut crumbs around the tabletop with his finger . " The reason I called ... uh-huh ... the reason I called ... uh-huh . " He took a final sip of coffee and said , " Listen , Ted , shut up for a minute , will you ? I have something important to say . Yeah ... that 's right . You 're my brother , and I love you , but I 've been holding this back for too long . Uh-huh .. . You know Billy ? Yeah , your kid , Billy , only he 's " - the man wiped his brow with a paper napkin - " he 's not your son . He 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the man continued , " What the hell do I mean ? I 'll tell you what the hell I mean . " And he did so , in excruciating detail . I half listened as I checked off my list : muscle twitching - negative ; bizarre behavior - negative . Out of the corner of my eye I watched G , C , and B working the other tables , approaching anyone drinking coffee from one of our vendors . We compared notes on the drive back to the motel . Beyond a doubt , True Confessions was a keeper . The early reports on its harmlessness seemed justified . Nevertheless , C 's idea of delivering test doses via adulterated coffee was a brilliant precaution , because no children became involved . We 're patriots , not monsters . M 's part in the operation had concluded that morning , and when we arrived at the motel room , she was in the bathroom removing tattoos . We quickly changed our clothes and cleaned the room for final departure , meanwhile logging our test results . M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink arms , and B and G went in to remove their disguises . M walked around the room gathering up her things and asking how it all went . C looked up from his handset long enough to say , " It 's true ! No offense is too large or too small for a detailed accounting . " M nodded thoughtfully , then turned to me and said , " And this is a good thing , why ? " I just grinned , and she let it drop , said she had to go get her kid , and left . G , meanwhile , was in the bathroom brewing up a celebratory pot of coffee . His idea of a joke . Six years ago , in March 2002,1 happened to attend a barbecue in the backyard of some good friends . As the flesh sizzled on the grill , we attempted small talk to pass the time , as we usually did . But in those early months , feelings were still too raw for small talk . Fortunately , there was beer . Someone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charts " - comparing the relative efficacies of a classical top-down hierarchy like General Motors and a distributed network like al-Qaeda . Apparently , the term " al-Qaeda " means " the database " in Arabic and was coined in the 1980s , when we were fielding freedom fighters in our Afghan proxy war against the Soviets . Not an operational organization itself , alQaeda is a sort of " Ford Foundation for jihadist startups , " as a pundit put it , that provides support in the form of financing , expertise , and coordination . In an " ah-ha moment , " one of us , with a mouth full of pulled pork , bragged that our old college crowd could form such an organization . Even better - because we were n't limited to box-cutter technology , we could out-qaeda al-Qaeda . It was a beer-soaked boast , soon forgotten . But not a week later , the president of the United States held a news conference at the White House . When reporters asked him about Osama bin Laden , who had recently escaped capture by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not that concerned about him . " In all honesty , this presidential statement floored me . Not concerned about bin Laden ? How could our president not be concerned about him ? Was there anything our government could have found to say to the American people that day more knuckleheaded than this ? A few of my friends gathered again , this time stone sober . We played one of bin Laden 's videotaped sermons to the West . This lunatic with a Kalashnikov , wagging his finger at our whole culture , had somehow slipped through our military 's grasp at Tora Bora . We should have had him - but we did n't . And then - according to the president - he and his whole murderous crew dropped off our radar altogether ? That did n't sit well with my friends and me , but we were n't sure what to make of it . The news-conference dismissal might have been nothing more than our president 's sometimes difficult way with words . Or his inability to admit to failure . But we did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of admitting that the hunt for bin Laden had gotten lost in the shuffle on the road to war in Iraq . It made us wonder if there was n't a place for private citizens in the war on terror . Perhaps we could lend a hand . An affinity group can form around any mutual interest : tasting Beaujolais wines , singing in a choir , attending a communal sauna . We called our group the American Curling Club . We are a small group of men and women who roomed and/or socialized together in college back in the day . We came from middle-class families and attended a prestigious , but not Ivy League , school . There was n't a legacy among us . We pretty much put ourselves through school with student loans , scholarships and grants , parental handouts , and part-time jobs . After graduation , we went our separate ways but kept in touch . We attended each other 's weddings , and we are watching each other 's kids grow up . We have built comfortable lives . We have climbed to uppermanagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and free markets . We are Christians , or at least most of us are . We 're your average janes and joes with no particular axe to grind , except this one Osama bin Laden must pay in full measure for what he has done . THE AMERICAN CURLING CLUB formed in order to play a key role in bringing bin Laden to justice : namely , to locate him . It seemed to us to be an important and doable project . If ourgovernment could n't orwould n't find him , we would . And when we found him , if only his grave , we would forward his coordinates to the relevant agencies . We would do this as a public service , not for the **26;3466;TOOLONG State Department bounty on him . Though our mission was lawful , we realized that pursuing it might require us to bend a few rules and make a few enemies . So we pledged our own lives and liberty to each other and swore an oath of secrecy . We established appropriate security protocols to shield the ACC core group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , including telecommunications , biochemistry , the military , civil government , and finance , but our contacts extended far into other areas . Each of us was charged with organizing further assets - networked cells and task groups - behind strong firewalls . Initially we chipped in our own savings to bootstrap our enterprise , but eventually our swifty cells became adept at targeting bank transfers in large offshore money-laundering operations . Soon we were able to finance ourselves by imposing " sin taxes " on drug cartels and playboy dictators . To name a few . In the summer and fall of 2002 , while we were recruiting our go-to , wizard , swifty , lineman , and expat cells , we met frequently to bat around ideas for achieving mission success . Because truly brilliant ideas can sound crazy at first , and because committees smother ideas , we declared that during our freewheeling brainstorming sessions no idea was too outrageous to say out loud . What if we invented a surrender dust , keyed to bin Laden 's DNA ? Or what about informer dust storms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days . What with all the news of war and rumors of war . What with the anthrax , Saddam , and the shoe bomber who ruined air travel forever . What if we embedded artificial memories in people throughout the Middle East so that they were certain they remembered Osama mocking the Prophet in public ? What if we afflicted all adult males taller than six foot three in the tribal regions of Pakistan with the mother of all tooth abscesses , requiring immediate dental surgery in Peshawar , and then watched the dentists ? With righteous fervor , in sessions that lasted through the night , we loosed the dogs of ingenuity upon the Sheikh of Saudi Arabia . What if we made the mountains of eastern Afghanistan begin to hum ? An unrelenting low-frequency thrumming that seemed to rise from the very rocks and that drove people out into open spaces screaming and tearing their hair ? My own rsum nominated me to form and coordinate our go-to cells , including an elite cell that I headed myself . Among my first recruits were several Desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They , in turn , helped me do background checks and interviews to fill out their own cells . People claim that this nation of ours is too polarized , that we hardly recognize the other half that does n't think as we do . But I 'm here to say there 's one issue that all Americans can agree on , no matter where they stand on most everything else : our nation wo n't rest until Osama bin Laden faces justice . This truth alone was our most effective recruitment tool . We characterized the ACC as an off-the-books government black op with one simple mission . The fact that we paid well , and in cash , helped , too . Eventually it was time to tether our brainstorming to reality . Our wizard cells were up and running , and we passed them our favorite ideas for critical feedback . They , in turn , fed us weekly " News-to-Use " summaries of developments across a broad range of fields . Our brilliant ideas became somewhat tempered by scientific reality . For instance , geneticists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They already have a potato rabies vaccine and a tomato HTV drug . Transgenic tobacco plants alone produce dozens of " farmaceuticals , " everything from human growth hormone to cancer drugs . What if we engineered a hybrid tomato or lettuce crop that contained a therapeutic dose of Xanax or Prozac and introduced it to the Middle East ? Could that help reduce the bloodshed ? Seriously , treat a whole region like a patient . Or : Does Osama use sunscreen ? For decades , sunscreen was whitish and opaque because of the properties of one of its chief ingredients , zinc oxide . In the 1990s , researchers found that if they made the zinc oxide particles really tiny , they could produce a much more pleasing clear sunscreen . It was one of the first commercial successes of nanotechnology , and the source of the first nanotech-related product liability lawsuits . The problem was that nanoparticles are so small they pass through the skin and enter the bloodstream . They even cross the blood-brain barrier and come to rest , like shells on a beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nanoparticles could be designed to collect in other kinds of tissue - feathers , for instance . That 's what one radar ornithology group is attempting to find out in an avian-flu-related study for the DoI . They are sizing and shaping nanoparticles of various materials to pass through the birds " skin and collect in developing feathers . Their ultimate goal is to nanobrand entire flocks of birds on the wing for precise tracking across the globe by radar . What if we found nanoparticles that collect in hair and beards instead ? Our flocks would be the occupants of jihadist camps , caves , and villages . We could detect and track them remotely . While the core group was still wrestling the angels of inspiration , my go-to cells were employed in preliminary logistical tasks : establishing safe houses , moving cash , rounding up supplies for the wizard cells . In this latter effort , C came to the fore with his experience in corporate R &D.; We purchased several whole laboratories " worth of gear and dropped it in selfstorage units on both coasts . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bombs ( we 're patriots , not terrorists ) , we were n't trafficking in restricted material per se . But lately our government has taken to quietly monitoring sales of even innocuous gear like beakers and pipettes , and we took great pains to leave no trail . We knew from the start that one of the ACC 's strengths was its position in the telecom industry , and we soon realized that Uncle Sam had provided us an easy leg up in prosecuting our mission . Al-Qaeda is notorious for passing communication by hand in order to circumvent electronic surveillance . One reason for this has to do with bin Laden 's own personal experience in the 1990s . According to news accounts at the time , Osama bin Laden really liked talking on his Inmarsat satellite phone . He especially enjoyed calling his mother in Saudi Arabia from his Afghan camps . We know this because the NSA was listening in on their conversations from at least 1996 . This happy arrangement , along with Osama 's charming navet , came to an abrupt halt one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her he would n't be able to call " for a while . " After hanging up , he turned off his sat phone . The next day , the president of the United States ordered a cruise missile strike on the phone 's last known coordinates . We blew up a desert training camp that day , but the Dark Prince had already flown . Is it any wonder that bin Laden became phone-shy after that ? Most reasonable people would . At some point , the NSA decided that if it could no longer tap bin Laden 's phone , the next best thing to do was tap everyone else 's . This was actually not a bad idea , but it required compliant telecom companies to shunt complex spur lines into secret listening posts , often small rooms inside switching stations , where NSA spooks could sift billions of calls through their voodoo supercomputers . In creating this system , the NSA had done the heavy lifting for us , and our linemen inside the same telecoms tapped their taps . Soon we were channeling the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for keywords and casting social nets . I MADE IT A POINT to become acquainted with the members of my go-to cells and their families , usually without anyone 's knowledge . I confirmed that we had recruited outstanding individuals . Smart , gutsy , none of your house-in-the-burbs , corporate-treadmill types . These were the cut-ups in middle school , the teenage pregnancies , the try-everything-once crowd . A little older now , a little more God-fearing and respectful of real realities . Solid . After the initial flurry of organization , I kept these folks busy every other weekend or so ( kinda like it used to be for the National Guard ) . I kept my own elite group busier , if only with training exercises , several days or nights a week . Before long we were a pretty tight unit . I had already worked with G , and he introduced me to C. And when I first recruited B , she told me about M , with whom she had served two tours . M was trained to pilot UAV combat drones , but lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . M had three kids , actually , but the older two had lived with their granny since they were born . Only the baby , a spoiled eight-year-old , lived with M. I found the kid hard to fool , but easy to bribe . In late 2002 , one of our wizards presented us with a tantalizing what-if . He owned a startup that had developed a gobsmackingly elegant algorithm for creating and identifying pretty good voiceprints from poor-quality audio . It processed voices acoustically with no regard to the language spoken and no use of keyword recognition . What if we trained all the phones in the world to recognize bin Laden 's voice ? His and his people 's . And whenever a phone anywhere recognized one of these voices speaking into it , it would discreetly send us a text message with its GPS coordinates and call details . And what if phones could be trained to do this remotely by a phone virus ? Voiceprint libraries could be updated automatically . It looked as if we had finally found our 21st-century Yankee box cutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I learned who was in other cells and groups only on a need-to-know basis . Some of our groups included young people at the beginning of their careers . Like young people everywhere , they sometimes let their issues get in the way of their work . On occasion , my team was directed to remind individuals of the confidential nature of our mission . One such action involved a young computer genius in the Pacific Northwest . I sent M out there to investigate ( Granny taking the kid temporarily ) . She reported back a few days later that the genius was a fool for pillow talk . To hear him speak , he was practically in charge of a countertenor task force . M also reported that the real loves of his life were his two Jack Russell terriers . So I sent G up there to tutor the kid in the art of discretion . G did a Godfather on the pooches , and genius boy woke up the next morning with two little surprised expressions lying on the pillow next to him . End of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset . She asked if that had really been necessary . Could n't G have simply dognapped them for a few days to make a point ? I said I would talk to him about it . In early 2003 , our weekly " News-to-Use " included three disparate bits of intel that , when put together , made an intriguing picture : ( 1 ) Pakistanis in the tribal regions were sneezing ; ( 2 ) a sixty-year-old DoD skunkworks project had borne fruit ; and ( 3 ) dandelions can make you high . ( 1 ) Ambrosia , commonly known as ragweed and native to North and South America , hitched a ride to Europe in the 19th century . The joy of hay fever has been spreading across Europe ever since . Apparently , the winds of recent wars have carried ragweed farther east , where it has found a suitable niche in the valley ecosystems of northern Pakistan bordering Afghanistan . It 's been found in Waziristan province as well , and as far south as Quetta . We requested specimens and seeds from an expat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross between A. aitemisiifolia , the most widespread species in North America , and A. dumosa , one that thrives in the Sonoran Desert . The Pakistani species was said to be a particularly noxious weed that pumped out clouds of pollen . ( 2 ) Since World War I , the U.S. Army 's Edgewood Arsenal and its successor unit have explored the use of chemicals in warfare , conducting open-air nerve-gas tests in Maryland and even dosing unsuspecting soldiers with superhallucinogens . Their perennial hobbyhorse has been a reliable truth serum , or at least one better than the problematic sodium pentothal . In recent decades much of the unit 's preliminary work has been outsourced to civilian researchers . In 2003 , there was buzz of a breakthrough : MDMOEP , a phenethylamine compound and kissing cousin of MDMA ( or ecstasy ) . Dubbed True Confessions , it was said to induce a state of abject self-reproach . Subjects were anxious to unburden themselves of their life 's misdeeds , and they actively sought out receptive listeners , including parties they might have injured . The drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no lasting side effects . What a boon to the war on terror ! If only it had been ready in time to avert the Abu Ghraib mess . In any case , the U.S. Army Chemical Corps swooped down on the private lab that had made the discovery , confiscated all records , and reminded all involved of the Patriot Act . ( 3 ) A brilliant young geneticist on the West Coast was doing groundbreaking work in biopharmaceuticals , especially in the mechanics of directing what part of the plant would store the finished drug - leaf , root , seed , or fruit . Moreover , according to our private sources , this same professor was also conducting a little biopharma project outside the purview of his university department . He was attempting to genetically modify the common dandelion to produce the marijuana cannabinoid THC . According to our report , once his stoner dandelion was perfected , the professor intended to take a sabbatical in order to scatter little parachute seeds of Mellow Yellow along roadways all over the temperate zone . What galvanized us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dandelion are members of the same Asteraceae family . It made us wonder . It definitely got the wheels turning . Development of our Yankee " vox cutter " proceeded quickly . The phone virus was coming along , and we had a SIMM chip in the works . However , we realized that even if we trained a million strategically located phone slaves to call us whenever they heard Osama 's voice , or any voice in our voiceprint library , what good would that do us if Laden &.; Co. never lifted a receiver ? We needed something to drive al-Qaeda to a phone . What we needed was a special friends-and-family calling plan for them , and we wondered if the army 's new guilt serum might do the trick . Not that we imagined for a moment that bin Laden felt any guilt or remorse over murdering three thousand Americans . But a crime does n't have to be an atrocity to stimulate the TC effect : everyday misdemeanors might do , like shorting waiters or telling off-color jokes . Bin Laden is human and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . He does have four wives , after all . And what about his fifty-three brothers and sisters and innumerable nephews and nieces ? Just how many weddings and funerals did he have to miss while hiding in a cave ? He inherited $80 million from his father and quickly turned it into $250 million . Even if that kind of return was earned honestly , how to explain to his twenty-four children that Daddy blew it all on jihad ? And how to explain to them his thing for Whitney Houston ? We set things in motion . First off was sizing up the deposed skunkworks PI on the True Confessions project . I sent M and C up there to see if he was n't suffering a case of defense-contractor hangover . He proved to be unapproachable , but one of his researchers had full-blown civil-liberties remorse . She had been caching her lab notes from the start and was trying to decide whether or not to post them anonymously on the Internet ( as if that might absolve her ) . She was only too glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could proceed any further , we had to test the drug ourselves in a real-world situation . There was no open or ethical way to do this , but at least we could do it in a controlled setting . So our wizards mixed up a test batch of TC , and my team performed our shopping-mall field trial . TC lived up to its billing , and the fact was not lost on us that many of our subjects turned to their cell phones for impromptu confessionals . Next was enlisting Professor Mellow Yellow . I wanted to soften him up first , so I sent G and C to his university office posing as DEA agents to scare the bejesus out of him . I was waiting for him in his home greenhouse when he showed up an hour later . I was sitting on a stool next to a potting bench that held trays of dandelions . Some of the cheery yellow flowers were sugar-frosted with sticky cannabis resin . I introduced myself as Mr. Homeland security and told him about all the kinds of trouble he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I offered to call off the drug dicks if he volunteered to serve his country in a very important mission . As it turned out , Prof. Mellow was so enthused by our mission and the sheer complexity of his part in it that I almost regretted siccing the DEA crew on him . I turned Prof. Mellow over to one of our wizard handlers and later learned that we set him up in a special complex of greenhouses , ostensibly doing research on new allergy meds for major pharma . In order to spread our voiceprint traps , the ACC set up several NGOs to integrate vox-cutter tech into the public-call-office landline systems in Pakistani villages and to subsidize the extension of cell coverage in remote areas . Back at home , we sent go-tos on shopping trips to stockpile cheap prepaid cell phones . We made cash purchases of handsets at every Wal-Mart and Radio Shack across America . We shipped boxloads of them to linemen who replaced their chips with our own vox-cutter SIMMs and bundled them for distribution with hand-crank chargers . Our wizards were keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were monitoring for any possible fallout or aftereffects , such as a change in homicide , suicide , or domestic-violence rates . The only aftereffect we detected was the lingering spell M seemed to have cast on the coffee wholesaler whose stock we had adulterated . Shortly after the test , he phoned his sister in Texas and told her about a woman he 'd met on a recent Sunday after church . They had hit it off in a big way . She had a precocious little girl who after only two days was calling him Uncle Duane . Uncle Duane was perplexed when all of a sudden his two special girls left town without so much as a good-bye , and he wondered if they were in any kind of trouble . A year later he continued to wonder , in rambling weekly calls to his sister . And I was unhappy with M about involving her kid in an operation . Time passed , and Project Phone Home burbled along . Prof. Mellow was making great strides in realizing two of our requirements for Ambrosia osamum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ragweed leaf or flower but on the surface of its pollen , where it could be readily absorbed by the mucous membranes of the eyes and nose . Second , the TC genes were to be expressed only in the first generation of ragweed plants . After that they turned themselves off . The last thing we wanted was for this guiltweed to get away from us and spread to wild plants . Unlike Prof. Mellow with his pet dandelions , the ACC is opposed to letting GM Frankensteins loose . We 're patriots , not God . When the time came for human trials , the prof rounded up volunteers among the greenhouse workers . The results were positive : red , runny noses ; itchy eyes ; and inflamed consciences . THENSOME BAD NEWS arrived to spoil the I mood . The civilian researchers from the army TC project I were being called in for lengthy interviews . We felt " U. pretty confident about our contact , since her neck was on the same block as ours . But there was the possibility the army might interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and C had become compromised . On top of that , Uncle Duane was still obsessing about M. By now she and the kid were the lost loves of his Uf e , and he posted photos of them on Flickr and on sites for missing and exploited children . Worse , his sister in Texas had persuaded him to hire a detective , for his own peace of mind . It was only a matter of time before Duane and the army bumped into each other , so in accordance with ACC firewall protocol , the core group ordered me to contain the damage . With prejudice , if necessary . I thought long and hard about how best to accomplish this . We could hardly strongarm Uncle Duane at that point , and we sure could n't stop the army . seeing no alternative , with or without prejudice , I called my go-to team together and broke the bad news . M was off the team , permanently . She should never have involved the kid . I told them that at the conclusion of the meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , where a relocation specialist would pick them up . M was to have cosmetic surgery and , just as important , a voice change . The ACC would cover all costs , including a monthly stipend . And a cash bonus when the bastard was captured or killed . But there would be no further contact between her and any of us , ever . B took it the worst , but the whole team was troubled . M said she knew she had screwed up royal but did n't want to put her daughter through a life on the run and asked if she could leave her with Granny . I said that was probably not such a hot idea , since the kid could ID us all . Besides , if she left her kid she would be miserable , and the kid would be miserable . In the end , my reasoning prevailed , and M and the team made their last farewells . M 's parting words were " I 'm gon na watch the news every night , and when we win , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God bless and good-bye . " I drove M to pick up the kid , then to their place to pack , and then on to the first leg of their brave new life . During the next two years , work on Project Phone Home proceeded smoothly . There were no further signs of the army or anyone else on our tail . Meanwhile , the ACC developed several backup plans for locating bin Laden , and my go-tos were engaged in implementing them . Seed day . We made final prep for handing off the GM ragweed to an expat in time for spring sowing in the lush valleys of northwest Pakistan . Six hundred hermetically sealed bags , fifty pounds each , of washed seed . I had sent C to the greenhouses to guarantee a pollen-free shipment . Some deluded soul over there , possibly Prof. Mellow high on dandelions , had plastered the shipping pallets with " Hillary in " 08 " stickers . Our immediate task was to double-bag the shipment in USAIDimprinted gunnysacks and transship it to a dummy agri-coop in Peshawar as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances , I had linemen rig up an industrial HEPA-filtered ventilation hood in the warehouse for us to work under . And I made my crew wear full hazmat gear . It was heavy work , and despite the January night and unheated warehouse , we fogged up our face masks with the effort . We finished at dawn , and after cleaning up and disposing of used filters , I sent the crew home . B and G waited with me for the freight company to pick up the seeds and a final pallet of phones , and then we went to an IHOP for breakfast . We were in a celebratory mood ; this marked the completion of our part in the vox-cutter project . From then on its success was up to strangers . We wolfed down a breakfast of cakes , eggs , and sausages . We proposed toasts with orange juice and coffee . G toasted to Operation Ragweed for Ragheads . B toasted to M and her kid , wherever they were and whoever they had become . When the waitress came over with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty of me and wrong , but I resent happy people like you . " She spoke calmly , refilled our cups , and went away . We gaped at each other . I stood up to peer over the booth partitions and saw patrons crying into their phones . We left immediately . The woman at the register told us how sometimes she pilfered from the tip jar . Her eyes and nose were not inflamed , so whatever vector was involved in dispersing the TC , it was n't our pollen . On the sidewalk outside , a guy on a mountain bike and a woman with a shopping cart were trying to unburden themselves to each other . So it probably was n't the coffee or restaurant food either . In fact , all up and down the street we saw penitents fessing up to one another . G craned his neck and peered into the sky . " Aerial spraying ? " he said . " An area-wide dragnet ? " We wondered if we were the target . But we did n't stick around to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our car . She looked at us and said , " Is this all I get ? " I helped her to her feet . " I mean , I know I 'm ugly . I 've known that since I was a child , but does it mean my life has to be so small and empty and meaningless ? " I turned her toward the intersection and told her to find a taxi and go home . And if she had a phone , to use it . We jumped into the car , G behind the wheel . " Where to ? " he yelled , pulling into traffic . I told him to drive back to the warehouse . No matter how the TC was being dispersed , our hazmat gear there had protected us . My plan was for us to suit up before evacuating the area . Then my phone rang , a call from C. I asked him where he was . He said , " I feel like telling you that ten years ago I acquired a complete microfiche set of engineering plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about that . Where are you ? " " At the warehouse . Listen , I sold the plans for a shitload of money . You want to know who to ? " I ordered him to destroy his phone and stay put till someone came for him . Then I hung up and told G to forget the warehouse and head for the bridge instead . He made a sharp U-turn and nearly hit an SUV . He had to brake so hard he stalled the engine . But instead of restarting it , he just sat there staring out the windshield . In the back seat , B said , " They showed us color photos of aborted fetuses . They said a baby as old as mine already had perfect little fingernails . " I ordered her to shut up and Gus to drive , but he turned around in his seat and said , " I saw my father kill my mother , and I lied to the police about it . " " Drive ! Drive ! " " I was only five years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he never fooled me . " I ordered them to hand over their cell phones , but Bella dialed a number , and as it rang she told us , " And perfect little eyelashes . " When her party answered , she began to weep . " Stop crying ! " I barked at her . But she did n't stop , and Gus joined her . A sight to behold-Gus Ostermann pressing the heels of his hands against his temples . " All the poor dogs ! " he cried . " And all the poor cats . " We sat there for a long time , traffic piling up and passing around us as we talked to the people we loved . Before army intelligence arrived , I received a text message from the ACC . A single word , backed by the authority of the core group - " JUG . " Short for jugulate , which was what they were directing me to do in order to protect the ACC . I could n't allow us to be taken alive , that much was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life for the group , and I will , only not right now . Right now I actually feel like answering a few questions . My name is William B. Boothtipple . My number is 973-555-0979 . If it 's busy , leave voice mail or keep trying ; no doubt I 'm on the other line spilling my guts . And now some shout-outs : - To Melody and her awesome kid , Kimmie , wherever you are and whoever you 've become . Duane was n't the only one you bewitched ; I think of you guys all the time . If I had known how much I 'd miss you , I would never have let you go . - To Osama . Hey , man , seriously , phone home . It 's been years since they 've heard your voice , and everyone 's worried sick .
