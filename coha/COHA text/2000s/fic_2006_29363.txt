A Clean Kill By Mike Stewart Random House Mike Stewart One Two little boys with blond bowl cuts were playing in the yard . Over and over , one tore across the lawn , holding a football overhead like the skull of an enemy , and then dove into a pile of dead leaves . The second kid piled on and they rolled around in the leaf pile , fighting like wild dogs over the football ; then the victor would pick up the ball and take off for another running dive into a new pile . I remembered doing pretty much the same thing twenty years earlier in a different small town with my brother . Some things are eternal . Young or old , rich or poor , human beings love to beat the hell out of each other . I sat down on the brick front steps across from a pretty blonde woman , balanced a plate of food on my knee , and watched . She smiled , and I motioned at the kids . " Are they yours ? " She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . " I did n't know Sara , so I arranged some turkey and dressing and cranberry sauce on a fork and put it in my mouth . She said , " Looks like they 're having fun . " I smiled and nodded and chewed . " Relative or friend ? " I looked at her . " Of ? " She laughed . " Sorry . Of our hosts . " " Oh . Friend . " She kept looking at me with her eyebrows raised , as though I was n't through talking . As a general rule , I try not to fill in conversational blanks . Atworst , it can get you in trouble . At best , well , it 's just babbling . But it was Thanksgiving . And , I thought , what difference does it make ? " The woman I would have been with today just moved back to the Midwest , and my elderly parents are on a holiday Caribbean cruise for elderly parents . " I pointed my empty fork at the sky . " So , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mug of coffee . " Oh , I know who you are . You 're Tom McIntosh , are n't you ? " " Close . I 'm Tom McInnes . " " Oh , sorry . Nice to meet you . I 'm Sheri Baneberry . Our hostess , B.J. , said I should talk to you . " Sheri had really large , spectacularly white teeth . Other than that , she was a perfect compilation of mediums-medium nose , medium build , medium-length hair . The overall impression was of a pretty , twentysomething woman completely devoid of sexuality-sort of a universal , upper-middle-class mom-in-waiting . Of course , I realized it was entirely possible that I was n't turning her crank , either . Anyway , that 's what I was thinking when a bloodcurdling scream pierced the crisp fall air , and I spilled gravy on my pants . The slightly smaller bowl cut was wailing and cupping a tiny hand under a nose streaming blood from each nostril . I started to stand , but the hurt little boy did n't wait for help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion , holding his nose and crying and screaming for his mother . The bigger kid froze for two beats and then hightailed it around the back of the house . I blotted at the gravy on my pants with one of those hand-embroidered linen napkins that pressure guests to struggle through the meal without actually having to wipe their mouths . I nodded in the direction of the little boy who had just galloped up the steps between Sheri Baneberry and me . " Dinner theater . " She smiled . " Which one were you ? " I stopped to think about what she meant . " I guess I was the nose breaker , since I was older . But my little brother would n't have run for Mom . He 'd have gone to find a baseball bat . " She laughed . " Do you two still have the same loving relationship ? " More than a year after his death , I still missed a beat before saying , " His name was Hall . He died last year . " " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baneberry turned sideways on the steps and pointed her knees at me . " But in a way it brings me to the thing I wanted to talk to you about . My mother passed away , well , it 'll be two weeks ago this Saturday . " I told her I was sorry for her loss . She just nodded and went on . " It was some kind of food poisoning . She was just forty-six , which surprises people . But she had me when she was twenty-one , which is younger than most people have kids nowadays , and she was pretty young-looking . So . . . anyway , Mom checked into Bayside on a Saturday afternoon . She 'd been sick all morning with the kind of stomach and intestinal problems you get with food poisoning . And the short version is that something went wrong and she died that night . " I set my plate on the bricks between my feet and folded my thirty-dollar napkin to hide the gravy smear . " I 'm sorry , Sheri , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading . I do go to court-I 'm not a green-visor , transactions kind of lawyer-but I tend to represent clients who 're involved in business disputes . An argument over a contract , something like that . " She flashed those big teeth , but it did n't seem friendly . " So you 're not a slimy plaintiff 's lawyer ? " " No , that 's not what I 'm saying . There are some bad doctors out there , just like there are bad lawyers and bad Indian chiefs , I guess . And there are good lawyers who do that sort of thing . It 's just not what I want to do . So I do n't . " " And B.J. tells me that if you do n't want to do something , you just do n't do it . " I looked into her medium-brown eyes . " Sounds almost unflattering when you say it . " She forced a small laugh . " Sorry , I guess I 'm not at my best . It 's just that I need someone I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was talking to B.J. inside , and she says that even though you can be kind of . . . " Sheri hesitated , and a rose blush crept up either side of her neck . " The last time I checked , B.J. was a friend of mine . So it could n't be that bad . " " Well , she just said you 're kind of headstrong . Maybe a little difficult sometimes . It was nothing much worse than that . But she also said , quote , ' Tom McInnes is as trustworthy as a Boy Scout . ' " I did n't really know what to say to that , since I was n't sure it was true , so I just looked at her . " She also says you 're supposed to be . . . well , ' smarter than God ' is the way she put it . " I smiled . " That 's what I keep telling people . " " Anyway , my father 's on the warpath . You know . He wants to sue everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer who 'll look at him and see dollar signs . " " Are you asking me to talk your father out of something ? Because I ca n't do that . " " No . Definitely not . I 'm looking for someone I can trust to take a look at what happened to my mother and give us an honest report . " Sheri took a sip of coffee from her mug as her eyes darted around our Thanksgiving hosts ' front yard . " I guess it 's obvious I do n't think Dad needs to sue anyone . Just putting the whole thing behind us is what I 'd like to do . But if one of the doctors or the hospital did something god-awful , then , you know , I guess we need to know that . " Across the lawn , what had been a series of neatly raked and rounded piles were now jagged circles of brown and red and yellow leaves . I turned back to examine my new client 's face . " Okay , Sheri . As long as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting . At this point , all I feel comfortable agreeing to do is analyze what 's there and give you a report , but the way we 're talking about doing this wo n't be cheap . A regular plaintiff 's lawyer would take it on contingency , which means he or she would only charge if you win . I do n't work that way , especially since I would n't be investigating with the goal of collecting a big verdict at trial . What I do is charge two hundred an hour , which is not unreasonable around Mobile . My investigator gets seventy-five . And this could take a while . " Sheri turned to look out at the yard and slowly , almost imperceptibly , nodded her head . " And , " I said , " as I already explained , if this thing goes to trial at some point , I would not want to handle it . You and I would both be happier if I handed it off to someone who tries cases like this every week . " Sheri Baneberry smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retainer or something , do n't they ? " I nodded . " Is five thousand okay ? That 's what B.J. suggested . " Now I smiled . " Five thousand 's fine . But let me talk to your father first . It may be the kind of thing that only takes a few phone calls . If it looks more complicated than that , you can give me the check . I 'll put it in a trust account and bill time and expenses against it . " I looked down at my plate of cold turkey and dressing smeared with congealed gravy . " Sheri , do you happen to know where Bill and B.J. keep the scotch ? " " Follow me . " The Monday morning after Thanksgiving , I sat watching silver raindrops explode and collect into rivulets on the panes of my window . My office was in the Oswyn Israel Building in Mobile-an old place where plaster is plaster and not Sheetrock and the windows actually have panes . Down the short hallway , I could hear the soft patter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was watching the late-November rain and thinking a little about reasons the INS should allow one of my clients to stay in the country , when the phone rang . I picked up the receiver and said hello . " Is this Tom McInnes ? " I said it was . " This is Jim Baneberry . You talked to my little girl , Sheri , on Thanksgiving about handling a lawsuit for us . " " No . Not exactly . I agreed to look into things for the family . To more or less analyze the case and report back to you and your daughter . " " Well , we do n't need you . " " That 's fine . You mind if I ask why ? " " I got a real law firm to take it . Not some guy out on his own . And they did n't try to hold me up for a five-thousand-dollar retainer . " I took a breath and reminded myself that the man had just lost his wife . I 'd always heard that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father dead center in the anger stage . " That 's not what happened , Mr. Baneberry . " " I know what happened . I was n't born yesterday . Somebody 's mother dies and you come swooping around like a . . . I wo n't say it . But you are n't gon na pull that on my family . Like I said , I 've got a major law firm on this now . And if you bother me or my daughter again , I 'll tell them to come after you , too . " I took a couple of breaths and turned back to gaze at raindrops puddling like lines of mercury along the bottom of each windowpane . In the distance , the rippled lead of Mobile Bay stretched out beneath fog and rain . As evenly as possible , I said , " Mr. Baneberry ? Which ' major firm ' did you hire ? " And he hung up on me . I fished out a business card Sheri Baneberry had given me and punched in the number . She answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is this Tom ? " " Yeah . I just got a call from your father . " " I was afraid of that . " Her voice sounded tight and hoarse . " I talked myself red in the face last night trying to get him to understand why I hired you . I do n't guess it did much good . " " Not much . " " Are you still going to help me ? " " Yep . " " Dad 's going to gum things up , though . " " It looks that way , Sheri . After the doctors and the hospital get a load of your father and his trial lawyers , well , they 're not going to be in a very cooperative mood , to say the least . So , considering all that , what we need to do is move fast and find out as much as possible before they start gumming up the works . " " I 'll call Mom 's doctor and see if she 'll talk to you . I 've known her forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She sighed . " I guess your job just got complicated . " Some of the stress had sifted out of her voice . " I 'll go ahead and send you the check , you know , the retainer we talked about . " I told her I 'd send over a runner that afternoon with a contract of representation . " By the way , Sheri , which law firm did your father hire ? " " Just a minute . " I heard scuffing sounds , and she came back on the line . " Here it is . I do n't have the lawyer 's name , but the firm is called Russell and Wagler . " " Shit . " A second passed before Sheri said , " That bad , huh ? " " Depends on which side you 're on . " Two Lush landscapes streamed by in shades of charcoal , stripped of color by heavy clouds and pouring rain . I was just north of Daphne , headed south from Mobile . The gray-tone groves and rolling pastures grew more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and suddenly I was in town . I turned off Highway 98 and headed east . A blinding flood of fat raindrops swamped the windshield . I reached down to flip the wipers on high and switch from low beams to fog lamps . I could now see lower , if not better . But I kept the halogen bulbs burning . They were highlighting gusts of rain and throwing shimmering zigzags across wet pavement . Inside the Jeep , the heater puffed hot air on my feet as Dean Martin sang " Silver Bells . " December was still two days away . I switched off the radio and listened to the pulsing whisper of wind billowing across the blacktop , making the Jeep sway a little as it went , and to the soft steady swoosh of water passing beneath my tires and washing over the windows . When I had spoken with Dr. Laurel Adderson by phone , she had been subdued yet concerned-maintaining a perfectly measured professional distance . Yes , she had been Mrs. Baneberry 's longtime physician . Yes , it was a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would n't mind meeting with me if it would help ease the family 's pain . She had asked me to meet her just outside Daphne , which almost made sense . It was , after all , the town where Dr. Adderson lived and practiced medicine ; and it was where Kate Baneberry had lived and died . So it would have been the perfect meeting place if only Dr. Adderson had n't insisted we meet at the Mandrake Club . She knew that in her offices I might have been tempted to ask to see medical records . I tried suggesting that we meet at the hospital . But that was where the treatment and death records were stored . So , without arguing , Dr. Adderson had simply said , " No. "
