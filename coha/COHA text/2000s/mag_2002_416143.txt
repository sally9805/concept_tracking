<p> More than anyone , Louis Leakey established paleoanthropology as a high-profile endeavor . By the time he died 30 years ago this month , his name had become synonymous with the search for human origins . A passionate naturalist and an astute chronicler , Leakey was also a showman who tirelessly publicized his discoveries to admiring audiences around the world . " He loved to be recognized , and to stimulate people by talking about what he 'd done and who he was , " his son Richard , 57 , himself an expert fossil hunter , has said . <p> Louis pursued a breathtaking range of interests . He studied fossil bones , stone artifacts and cave paintings . He published monographs on the social customs of the Kikuyu people of Kenya and the string figures , comparable to cat 's cradles , made by people in Angola . Believing that the behavior of monkeys and apes held clues to the nature of our evolutionary ancestors , he established a research station in Kenya near Nairobi for the study of primates , and he encouraged such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galdikas to live in the wild with , respectively , chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans . Long before wildlife conservation became popular , Leakey helped establish national parks in Kenya . He was an expert stone knapper , or toolmaker , and would delight in making sharp implements with which he would swiftly skin an animal whenever he had an audience . His knowledge of animal behavior was encyclopedic , and he was a keen ornithologist , which he had once thought would be his career . <p> " Everything Louis did , he did with enthusiasm , " remembers Andrew Hill , professor of anthropology at Yale . " He 'd even be enthusiastic about the breakfast he prepared or the dinner he cooked . It could get a little wearing , especially at breakfast if you were n't a morning person . " Perhaps not surprisingly , some colleagues found Leakey 's eclecticism off , putting . " It annoyed a lot of people , who felt that with such a broad range of interests , he could n't possibly be taking seriously their chosen field of study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Penn State . To critics , Leakey seemed more dilettante than Renaissance man . <p> Although Louis grabbed the headlines , it was his second wife , Mary , an archaeologist , who made many of the actual finds associated with the Leakey name . Until later in their relationship , when their marital ties all but snapped for both personal and professional reasons , she let her husband bask in the limelight while she conducted her beloved fieldwork . <p> Louis Leakey was an easy target for critics , partly because he flouted social convention but mainly because several of his most dramatic claims turned out to be wrong . In his excitement , he sometimes announced a bold new theory before marshaling all the available evidence  --  an approach that is anathema to careful science . He was a maverick by any standard  --  " anything but typically English , " as he said of himself  --  and scorned bookish academics who were " only prepared to devote a few months to field research and then return to more lucrative and comfortable work in the universities . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by academia and to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society , Britain 's most prestigious scientific organization . <p> That honor eluded him , however . For one thing , some of his colleagues regarded Leakey 's flamboyant , sometimes fanciful writings as not sufficiently scientific . But his personal life was also an impediment . When he was 30 years old , he had scandalized Cambridge colleagues by leaving his wife , Frida  --  she was at the time pregnant with his second child  --  to be with Mary Nicol , whom he later married . Even more damaging to his fellowship chances , in Leakey 's own view , was the time he privately criticized an article by Sir Solly ( later Lord ) Zuckerman , a powerful member of the society and chief scientific adviser to the British government . According to Leakey family biographer Virginia Morell , Leakey believed that it was Zuckerman who repeatedly blocked his election to the Royal Society . <p> In keeping with the archetype of the preoccupied scientist , he was notoriously indifferent to his appearance ; on the rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was usually skewed and stained with food or something . " But his charisma was impeccable . " He could charm the birds out of the trees , " Mary Smith , an editor at the National Geographic Society , which supported Leakey 's work , told biographer Morell . Rosemary Ritter , an archaeologist who worked with him in California , has said Leakey " had a way of making even the littlest , most unimportant person feel important . That 's why people were so willing to work for him . " <p> Leakey had a magnetic effect on many women . Irven DeVore , professor emeritus of anthropology at Harvard , recalled to Morell his first encounter with Leakey , in Nairobi in 1959 : " He was dressed in one of those awful boiler suits , and he had a great shock of unruly white hair , a heavily creased face and about three teeth .. When my wife , Nancy , and I got back to our hotel , I said to her , ' Objectively , he must be one of the ugliest men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Are you kidding ? That 's the sexiest man I 've ever laid my eyes on . ' " Leakey understood his appeal to the opposite sex and philandered with characteristic enthusiasm . His amatory rambles eventually undermined his marriage to Mary . <p> Born in Kabete , in colonial Kenya , he was the son of Harry and Mary Bazett Leakey , who ran an Anglican mission northwest of Nairobi . Louis spent much of his youth among Kikuyu children , and his three siblings were often his only European peers . From the Kikuyu he gained a sense of intimacy with nature that instilled a lifelong passion for wildlife . Shipped off to public school in England at age 16 , he later scribed himself as " shy and unsophisticated " and awkwardly out of touch with the English way of life . <p> Still , he attended Cambridge University , his father 's alma mater , where he earned a bachelor 's degree in archaeology and anthropology and , later , a doctorate for his research in East Africa . His plans to search for early human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing of significance to be found there , " he recalled being told by a Cambridge professor . " If you really want to spend your life studying early man , do it in Asia . " Pithecanthropus , now called Homo erectus , or erect man , had been discovered in Java just before the turn of the century , and in the 1920s a similar kind of early human , called Peking man , had been found in China . <p> Leakey stubbornly followed his instincts . " I was born in East Africa , " he would later write , " and I 've already found traces of early man there . Furthermore , I 'm convinced that Africa , not Asia , is the cradle of mankind . " <p> Charles Darwin , in his 1871 book scent of Man , had suggested that because our closest evolutionary relatives , chimpanzees and gorillas , live in Africa , the earliest humans probably once lived there too . Leakey was just 13 when he decided to devote himself to the study of prehistory and find out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus challenged the conventional wisdom , which appealed to his contrarian nature . " I became excited with the idea that everyone was looking in the wrong place , " he later explained . In the fall of 1931 , on his third expedition to East Africa but his first to Olduvai , he found primitive stone axes in ancient sediments , evidence that ancestors of humans had indeed lived in Africa . It was a significant discovery  --  " I was nearly mad with delight , " he recalled-but Leakey 's penchant for over-reaching soon got the better of him . <p> In addition to staking his career on the notion that Africa was the cradle of humankind , he also believed , given the fossil evidence , that the earliest bipedal human ancestors , or hominids , must have existed hundreds of thousands of years earlier than most other scientists were willing to say . Indeed , the reason for that first trip to Olduvai Gorge was to test the idea that a modern-looking skeleton , discovered by German scientist Hans Reck in 1913 , was , as Reck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of the deposits in which it had been found . <p> Leakey , initially skeptical of Reck 's assertions , visited the site with Reck and soon agreed with him . They coauthored a letter to the British journal Nature reporting the new evidence for Reck 's original theory  --  which also appeared to confirm Leakey 's hunch that our first true ancestor lived farther back in prehistory . " Reck must be one of the few people who succeeded in swaying Louis once his mind was made up , " observes Leakey 's biographer Sonia Cole . But a few years later , other researchers , using improved geological methods , concluded that the skeleton was n't ancient at all , but had simply been buried in far-older sediments . <p> In 1932 , Leakey was also making extravagant claims of antiquity for fossils from two sites in western Kenya , Kanam and Kanjera . The Kanam jawbone , Leakey boldly announced , was " not only the oldest human fragment from Africa , but the most ancient fragment of true Homo yet to be discovered anywhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kanjera and Kanam specimens were relatively recent . Leakey 's reputation already had taken a beating when a British geologist visited Kanjera and reported that Leakey did not know exactly where he had found his famous fossil  --  an astonishing lapse for an anthropologist . <p> Leakey shrugged off his critics . He and Mary pressed on , and in 1948 they received their first real taste of public adulation with the discovery of a little skull of an 18-million-year-old ape called Proconsul . It was the first fossil ape skull ever found , and Mary flew with it to England so that Wilfrid Le Gros Clark , Leakey 's friend and an anthropologist at Oxford , could examine the specimen . The plane was met by reporters , photographers and newsreel cameramen . Later , with the skull on display at the airport , Mary told Leakey , " Two plainclothes detectives assigned to guard it never let it out of their sight . " <p> Then , in 1959 , came the now-famous discovery , in Olduvai , of a 1.75-million-year-old skull that Leakey named Zinjanthropus boisei , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South African near-men.and true man as we know him . " The skull was similar to those of the robust ape-man creatures that had been found in South Africa , but differed from them in having heavier bones and bigger teeth . Nearly three decades of work had at last been rewarded , it seemed , and the huge publicity surrounding the find propelled the Leakeys  --  particularly Louis , though Mary had actually discovered the skull  --  to still greater fame . <p> Louis embarked on a speaking tour in the United States and Europe , and established a long and dose relationship with the National Geographic Society , which publicized the Leakeys often in its magazine and provided them with financial support . In November 1960 , 19-year-old Jonathan , the eldest of the couple 's three sons , made a discovery that was even more important than Zinjanthropus . Working near the Zinj site , he found a jawbone that was even more humanlike . It came to be known as pre-Zinj , because it was unearthed from deeper sediments and presumed to be older than Zinjanthropus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now generally known as Paranthropus boisei . ) <p> In time , and as the Leakey team uncovered more fossil material , Louis became convinced that pre-Zinj was the ancient species of Homo he 'd been seeking for so long . It had a bigger brain and was less ruggedly built than the so-called ape-men . He called it Homo habills , or handy man , a reference to the stone tools at the site that Leakey was convinced the creature had made , and he believed it to be the ancestor of modern humans , Homo sapiens . <p> In 1964 , Leakey and two coauthors submitted their findings on Homo habilis to the journal Nature . The response was fast and largely furious . Anthropologists dispatched condemnatory letters to the London Times and scientific journals . Their message : pre-Zinj was nothing more than an australopithecine , not a separate species of Homo . Part of the criticism was that in naming the new species , Leakey brashly changed the definition of Homo so that pre-Zinj would qualify . For example , at the time , a species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at least 700 cubic centimeters in volume . By this standard , pre-Zinj was something of a pinhead , with a brain of just 675 cubic centimeters ( the average human brain has a volume of 1,300 cc ) . <p> Other discoveries that Leakey made in the 1960s also generated controversy . On an island in Lake Victoria , he found fossil evidence of two new primate species that he said pushed back the origins of human beings by millions of years . His claims were immediately met with harsh criticism . He called the primates Kenyapithecus . One species was 20 million years old . He named it africanus and claimed that it was the oldest hominid ever found . Experts disputed the claim then , arguing that it was a fossil ape , which remains the prevailing view . The other species , Kenyapithecus wickeri , was some 14 million years old . Its pedigree is checkered . Leakey first said it was more ape than human , but later modified that view . Scientists now believe that it is the most advanced fossil ape of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again when , at a scientific meeting in 1967 , he argued that a lump of lava found at the Lake Victoria fossil site had been used by Kenyapithecus wicked as a tool . The announcement , made with Leakey 's usual flourish , fell flat . Not one scientist in the audience asked a question , probably , as paleoanthropologist Elwyn Simons later observed , because they considered the idea " outlandish . " Mary Leakey , too , was unconvinced . " I ca n't believe he really thought it was a 14-million-year-old stone tool , " she told biographer Morell after Leakey 's death . The incident , Morell writes in her 1995 book Ancestral Passions , " added to a growing suspicion that Leakey 's scientific , judgment was slipping . " <p> It 's in the nature of paleoanthropology to undergo constant revision , as was made clear this past summer , when a new contender in the quest for the earliest hominid was announced . A six- to seven-million-year-old skull , found in Chad by paleoanthropologists from France , is older and yet appears more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . Those features , plus its discovery far from Kenya or Ethiopia ( the other leading candidates for the place where human beings split from the common ancestor we share with apes ) are prompting experts to reconceptualize the human family lineage . <p> By the late 1960s , Leakey was little involved in fieldwork , partly because of ill health but also because he was devoting so much time to raising money for the many research endeavors he oversaw . He was , however , directing a dig at Calico Hills , east of Los Angeles . Hundreds of stone flakes had been recovered from the site , and the excavators believed them to be human artifacts . <p> That was an extraordinary claim because the site was as much as 100,000 years old , and most anthropologists believe that humans came to the Americas no earlier than 30,000 years ago , and probably much more recently . <p> Leakey 's support of the Calico claim dismayed not only his friends and colleagues , but also Mary , and it would become a factor in their estrangement . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position as " catastrophic to his professional career and.largely responsible for the parting of our ways . " <p> Yet despite his occasionally misplaced enthusiasms , Leakey remains a seminal figure . " Although Louis was not highly regarded for his science , " says Penn State 's Alan Walker , " he made a major contribution in opening up East Africa for paleoanthropological exploration , making the science possible . ' Others remember his pioneering spirit . " He had an energizing effect on the field and on the people doing the research , " says David Pilbeam , professor of anthropology at Harvard . " He could be sloppy and brilliant , prescient and foolish . But , given the time in which he was working , overall his instincts were right , " <p> So right , in fact , that Leakey 's view would prevail and most anthropologists would eventually accept Homo habills as a legitimate member of the human family , though not necessarily as the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens . Inspired by his father 's work on human origins , third son Richard Leakey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late September 1972 , Richard flew down to Nairobi from his research site at Lake Rudolf ( now Turkana ) to show his father his team 's latest find , a large-brained skull thought at the time to be 2.6 million years old . The specimen was named 1470 . <p> " It 's marvelous , exclaimed Louis . " But they wo n't believe you . " Remembering his own experience with the skeptics , Louis was looking forward to the fight over whether 1470 was a species of Homo , which Richard argued it was . As Richard recalled the encounter , the skull " represented to Louis the final proof of the ideas he had held throughout his career about the great antiquity of quite advanced hominid forms . " <p> But on October 1 , a few days after holding the fossil in his hands , Louis Leakey died of a heart attack on a visit to London .
