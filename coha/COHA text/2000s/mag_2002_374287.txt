Take in a ball game at the stadium that bore Enron 's name , and you 'll be sitting in a place now called Minute Maid Park . The tilted E that blazed in front of Enron 's Houston headquarters is gone , sold at auction . At its offices , a pared-down staff administers old contracts and remaining assets like gas pipelines and power plants . It 's nothing like the days when secretaries received gifts of Waterford crystal and executives jetted to luxury resorts to party . Enron 's Christmas bash this year : an afternoon gathering in the lobby with coffee , cookies and music by an employee choir . <P> Although Enron may be finished as a company , the fallout from its collapse is rolling on . The firm says it 's facing 22,000 claims totaling $400 billion ; everyone from investors to ex-employees wants a piece , including folks who worked at its Old Economy power companies and lost their life savings . Enron 's profiteering from California 's power crunch ( along with that of other energy traders ) saddled Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it may take five years to prosecute the wrongdoers . The debacle 's winners ? All those lawyers probing and pecking at Enron 's carcass . <P> Given that legacy , it 's worth recalling how revered Enron once was . The firm tried to put into practice the idea that nearly anything can be turned into a financial product and , through complex statistical modeling , traded for profit . Asset-light and heavily reliant on intellectual capital , Enron rewarded innovation and punished employees deemed weak . Those ideas were New Economy chic , and to some extent retain currency . Energy traders still use financial instruments that Enron pioneered in order to hedge against price swings . As for those notorious off-balance-sheet partnerships , " they can be used legitimately for financing projects in high-risk countries , " says Michelle Michot Foss , an economist at the University of Houston . <P> What the public would perhaps most like to see is Enron 's top executives do some jail time . So far , only one of them , former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow , is facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundering ( he denies wrongdoing ) . Ex-chairman Ken Lay is expected to be charged with insider trading before long . But lengthy prison sentences for white-collar crimes are rare . <P> Prosecuting former CEO Jeffrey Skilling , widely seen as Enron 's mastermind , will probably be the trickiest case . Skilling was so sure he had committed no crime that he waived his right against self-incrimination and testified before Congress that " I was not aware of any inappropriate financing arrangements . " Prosecutors may try to nail him for perjury , and they have reportedly widened their probe to investigate his role in Enron 's broadband venture . <P> But proving what he knew and when he knew it wo n't be easy . " Skilling used words like ' Get this structure to work ' when he knew the only solution was to break the rules . But he never said , ' Do it , ' " says a former employee . Pretending it was all a game helped too . A videotape of a 1997 party surfaced this month , showing Skilling joking that Enron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new accounting technique . It was close to true , and not so funny .  --  By Daren Fonda , with reporting by Deborah Fowler/Houston and Sean Scully/Los Angeles
