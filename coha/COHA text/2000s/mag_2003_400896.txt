2003 BIKE BUYER 'S GUIDE Headnote A quick guide to the care and feeding of your new bike . // Coming home with a new bike is n't quite like coming home with a new baby ( for one thing , you have to change your bike only when it flats ) . But there is an undeniable similarity : Just as a child upends your life , a bike has the potential to alter everything from your waistline to your perspective on the best way to get to the corner store for a jug of milk . Fortunately , bikes are much simpler to care for than children . Here 's everything you need to know to get started . Ride , Ride , Ride When asked how cyclists could most improve , the legendary racer Eddy Merckx succinctly replied , " Ride lots . " Any amount of riding is fun , but to significantly strengthen your cardiovascular system and leg muscles you should aim for at least 20 to 30 minutes of continuous pedaling , 3 to 5 days a week . Start your rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then go ahead and play as hard as you want . As you ride , be sure to vary your pace : Go hard sometimes , then so slow you feel guilty . This uses your muscles in different ways , and it 's simply more fun than an unchanging grind . If you think you do n't have time for a ride , try the 10-minute trick : Get dressed and ride away from your house for 10 minutes . If you do n't feel like riding after that , turn around and go home . At the least , you 'll have ridden 20 minutes-but usually when you start riding you continue . You should drink about 1 bottle of water during a 1-hour ride . You wo n't need to eat during the ride unless you 're out longer than an hour . Fuel can range from energy gels ( about $1 to $1.50 each ) to kitchen staples such as bananas or Fig Newtons . Here are two simple ways to add intensity and take your riding to the next level : * Speed play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Sprint for every town-limit sign . Give one rider a 1-minute head start before the rest chase him down . Assign king of the mountain " points to a favorite climb-ride to the bottom in a group and then open it up in a race to the top . These games mimic the structure of com-plex training plans-without the tedium . * Ride in Ines . Instead of meandering down the road in a group , ride single-file , trading turns at the front where you block the wind for the others . With two buddies , for instance , you spend one-third of the time at the front riding hard and two  --  thirds recovering in the draft . Because most of the group is resting most of the time , your overall speed can be much higher . A general rule is the more riders you have , the shorter the pulls . When your turn at the front is done , pull off to the left and drift back down the line , then swing right to latch onto the back of the paceline . Pamper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home mechanic to perform the basic TLC that 'll keep your bike running smooth ( although for some cyclists , maintenance becomes part of the fun ) . The first-and most important  --  step is prevention . These are tasks anyone can perform . Before every ride : * Check your tires for proper inflation ( printed on the tire sidewall ) and visually inspect them for cuts or excessive wear that indicate it 's time for new tires. * If your chain is dry , put a drop of lube on each link pin ( where the links meet ) . Backpedal the chain for a minute to work the lube into the pins , then wipe it clean with a rag . If your chain is dirty , clean it with a rag and degreaser before lubing. * Squeeze the brakes firmly . If they feel mushy , dial out ( that 's counterclockwise ) the barrel adjusters on the levers or down at the brake arms . * Be sure the quick-release levers that clamp the wheels into the frame and fork are securely fastened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires either an investment in tools or a trip to the bike shop . Here 's what you should plan for : * Monthly . Check shifting and brakes ; lube cables ; check wheels for true and round ; wash bike ; lube suspension fork sliders. * Every 3 months : Check brake pads for wear ; inspect chainrings and cogs for bent teeth ; check shoe cleats for wear ; check bolts for proper tightness ; grease seatpost. * Every 6 months : Overhaul suspension fork ; thoroughly dean drivetrain with solvent ; replace chain ( at least twice a year ) . * Yearly : Replace cables and housing ; complete bike wash ; lube bearings and replace gritty-feeling ones ; true wheels ; replace brake pads ; overhaul fork . Home Repair If you hope to take care of minor maintenance yourself , you can outfit a home shop for about $100 . This will let you snug bolts , install pedals , handle minor repairs such as truing a wheel , and replace some of the simple parts ( from a water bottle cage to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hex wrenches  --  1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 8mm ( $10-$36 ) * 15mm pedal wrench ( $20 ) * floor pump with dual schrader/presta head and pressure gauge ( $30 and up ) * spoke wrench ( $7 ) * chain tool ( $13 ) * large brush , pipe cleaner brush , sponge , bucket ( $15 ) To make life easier , you can invest in a workstand for about $100 . But most of us start out leaning our bikes against the garage wall . For a clear , thorough guide to repair , check out our book , BICYCLING Magazine 's Guide to Bicycle Maintenance and Repair ( $20 at bicycling.com ) . Get the Gear Cycling can be a gear-intensive sport-one day you might find yourself agonizing over a set of aftermarket carbon brake levers . But to start , all you really need is this stuff : * Shorts . Padded shorts come in either tight-fitting spandex or " baggies " that feature a spandex liner under a loose outer shell . The choice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two favorites : Nema 's baggy Crown Jewel ( $80 , 888/NEMA-USA ; nema-usa.com ) and Pearl Izumi 's spandex Attack short ( $60 , 800/328-8488 ; pearlizumi.com ) . * Helmet . Did you know all helmets sold in the U.S. have to meet the same safety standards , whether they cost $20 or $160 ? For the most bang for the buck , we like Bell 's Influx ( $75 , 800/456-2355 ; bellsports.com ) and Giro 's Havoc ( $80 , 831/420-4010 ; giro.com ) . * Gloves are offered in full- and half-finger designs . One of our favorites is 661 's Raji ( $25 , 661/257-2756 ; sixsixone.com ) . * Hydration system . The traditional bottle-and-cage is good , and you can get a complete setup for about $25 . To carry a lot of water and stuff ( like a rainjacket , lunch and car keys ) , or for trails where you do n't want to take your hands off the handlebar to drink , get a hydration pack such as CamelBak 's basic HydroBak ( $30 , 800/767-8725 ; camelbak.com ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pump . You can get a complete setup that lets you handle most midride emergencies for $50-$60 . If you do n't have a cell phone , stick a couple quarters in the bag for calling home . Advanced Course After these basics , the next piece of gear you buy should be shoes . Shimano 's SH-M020 shoe and PD-M424 pedals ( $55 and $60 , respectively , 949/951-5003 ; shimano.com ) get you clipped in and riding for less than half the cost of some high  --  end shoes . Most cyclists also end up riding with a jersey ( $25-$150 ) and sunglasses . Smith 's Slider series gives you three sets of replaceable lenses plus a frame for about $100 ( 208/726-4477 ; www.smithsport.com ) . Keep everything you need for your next ride set out ; this makes it more likely that you 'll get on your bike more often . And nothing makes your baby happier than going for a ride . Sidebar BIKE ETIQUETTE Sidebar Aside from our own resident Style Man ( who you have to take with a grain of carbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are six basic rules for avoiding boorish biking : Sidebar * Always say " on your left " when passing other riders or pedestrians . Then pass on their left . Sidebar * Take your pull in a paceline . It 's bad form to suck wheels-draft behind-the whole time and get the benefit of the draft without doing any work . If you 're too hammered to pull through , say so-once-then take your turn next rotation . * When descending on singletrack , yield the right-of-way to climbing riders , all hikers and all equestrians. * When you pass a rider making road or trailside repairs , ask if he has everything he needs . * At least wave at fellow cyclists . Smile if you can manage it . Do n't wait Sidebar for them to do it first . * Do n't draft behind someone you do n't know . It 's rude . First pull alongside , say hi , get a sense of if he 's into riding with you . // <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
