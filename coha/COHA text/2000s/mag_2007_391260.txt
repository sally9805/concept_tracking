" My mother stepped out for just thirty seconds to get my other daughter from the living room , " recalls Leah 's mom , Shelly McCammon , an Atlanta interior designer . " In that time , Leah pulled herself up by grabbing the faucet and turned it on , sending 128-degree water splashing down . " Three days later , Leah died . It 's tragic but true : More than 2,000 children die each year as a result of unintentional home injury , and the highest rates are among babies under a year , according to the Home Safety Council . Here , the four leading causes of infant death and injury at home  --  and how to prevent them . Falls DANGER : Too few baby gates " Parents often put gates at the top of stairs but not at the bottom , so their child crawls up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appy , president of the Home Safety Council . Another potential problem : pressure gates , which can be pushed over . LIFESAVER : Choose hardware-mounted gates for the top and bottom of the stairs . And make sure the gates ' openings are small enough that your baby 's head ca n't fit through . DANGER : Baby walkers In 2004 more than 3,900 kids under the age of 4 were treated in the emergency room for baby-walker-related injuries . Even more alarming , 80 percent of infants who suffer these injuries are being supervised , according to Safe Kids Worldwide . LIFESAVER : Ditch the walker . " Research shows they do n't even teach babies to walk , " says Leslie Feuerborn , injury prevention and education coordinator at Denver 's Children 's Hospital . DANGER : Unattended babies in carriers " Parents may think that if they strap their babies in , they can leave them alone in a car seat on a table , " says Karen Sheehan , M.D. , medical director of the Injury Prevention and Research Center at Children 's Memorial Hospital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies wiggled out and fell off a table , causing severe head injury . " LIFESAVER : Never leave your baby alone in a carrier on a high surface like a countertop or dryer . Suffocation DANGER : Sleeping with your baby in the bed Unintentional choking or suffocation is the leading cause of infant death  --  and 60 percent of these tragedies occur in beds or cribs . " We 've been seeing a lot more cases where the babies were suffocated by sleeping with their parents , " says Ruth Borgen , M.D. , director of pediatric emergency medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey . LIFESAVER : If you want your baby to be within arm 's reach at night , put him in a crib that attaches to the side of your bed . DANGER : A cluttered crib Pillows and blankets may look cute , but they can roll on top of your baby ; if she does n't have the strength to roll over , she can suffocate . LIFESAVER : Instead of a blanket , buy an infant sleep sack that zips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods Grapes , popcorn , raisins , slices of hot dog  --  anything that 's between the size of a dime and a quarter can block your baby 's windpipe . LIFESAVER : Cut grapes in quarters and hot dogs lengthwise when you 're cutting them into pieces , and do n't leave bowls of nuts or candy on tables within your baby 's reach . " I recommend every new parent take a first-aid class at their American Red Cross or children 's hospital , " says Dr. Sheehan . Drowning DANGER : Water in cleaning buckets About 30 children  --  most of them infants  --  die each year from drowning in buckets . " The baby crawls over , falls headfirst into the bucket , and then ca n't right himself , " says Feuerborn . LIFESAVER : Make sure your baby is secure in his crib or playpen while you 're cleaning . ( Also keep toilet lids shut so he ca n't topple in . ) DANGER : Infant bathing seats More than half of infant drownings occur in bath-tubs  --  but do n't buy a bathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There have been hundreds of deaths and injuries related to baby bath seats , which give parents a false sense of security , so they leave their babies unattended in them . " Usually , the suction cups on the bottom of the seat detach from the tub , and the baby gets trapped underwater in the seat , " says Dr. Sheehan . LIFESAVER : Skip the bathing seat ; instead , be sure all supplies are within reach of where you 'll be washing your baby ( whether it 's a bathtub or baby tub ) , says Dr. Sheehan . And never turn your back . DANGER : Kiddie pools Each year an estimated 300 children under age 4 drown in swimming pools  --  something to keep in mind if you 're taking a warm-weather vacation this season . " We 're particularly worried about the larger wading pools , " says Appy . " Parents do n't usually empty them after each use , but because they 're smaller than built-in pools , parents do n't invest in safety precautions like fences . " LIFESAVER : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fence with a gate to encircle it . Also , if you 're visiting someone who has a pool , do n't assume safety precautions have been taken , and always stay within arm 's length of your baby . Fires and burns DANGER : A too-hot home water heater A child exposed to 140-degree water for three seconds will sustain third-degree burns . LIFESAVER : Set your water heater to 120 degrees Fahrenheit . If you live in a building where you do n't have access to the water heater , use an anti-scald device like Hot Stop ( h2otstop.com ) , a spout that shuts off water if it rises above 120 degrees . DANGER : Spilled coffee " I 'm amazed at how many ER burns I see where it turns out a parent was juggling an infant and a cup of coffee at the same time , " says Dr. Sheehan . LIFESAVER : If you 're sipping hot liquid , use a travel mug . And never leave a cup of coffee or bowl of soup on a kitchen table . " We see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablecloth and the liquid has spilled all over him , " says Feuerborn . DANGER : An outdated smoke alarm Two-thirds of child deaths and injuries in residential fires occur in homes where there 's no working smoke alarm . But even if you have an alarm in your house , it may not function as well as you expect . " If your smoke alarm is older than ten years , it will start to lose sensitivity , " says Appy . LIFESAVER : Replace any smoke alarm that 's more than ten years old , and test all your alarms once a month by pushing the alarm button . When shopping for alarms , look for ones that interconnect , so that when one goes off , they all do ( that way you 'll be alerted to a fire in the basement even if you 're upstairs ) . If it 's not time to replace your alarms yet , consider hiring an electrician to interconnect the ones you already have . Keeping your baby safe is a full-time job , but following these tips will make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be there , make sure all caregivers know and follow this advice , too .
