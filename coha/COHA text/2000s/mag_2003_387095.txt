Section : Cover Thirty thousand roses , two ' I do 's , ' one kiss : Trista Rehn and Ryan Sutter , reality TV 's It couple , tie the knot in a $4 million extravaganza <p> For a moment on Dec. 5 , Trista Rehn and Ryan Sutter found themselves in a strange and unfamiliar position  --  off camera . With none of the 22 lenses on hand to capture their wedding weekend trained on them , reality TV 's most successful experiment in romance could finally let down their guard and stop all the lovey-dovey stuff . So what did they do ? " They 're over in a corner kissing ! " recalls their wedding planner Mindy Weiss . " I finally had to tell them , ' You need to stop . We need to finish here . Seriously . ' As mushy as I am , even I could n't take it anymore . " <p> That stolen smooch was just a prelude to the stunningly lavish ( $4 million ! ) Dec. 6 wedding of Trista and Ryan . The Harlequin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped the question on the finale of The Bachelorette last February and spawned three highly rated ABC specials  --  played out like a prime-time version of many a little girl 's fantasy . " You do n't want to sound materialistic , but you 're going , ' Wow , this is really cool ! ' " says Trista 's stepmother Carol Rehn , one of 300 guests invited to the spare-no-expense ceremony at the Lodge at Rancho Mirage in Southern California 's Palm Springs Valley . " There is no way to describe it . It was surreal . " <p> And that 's not even taking into account that Trista , 31 , a former physical therapist , and strapping but sensitive firefighter Ryan , 29 , cashed in a cool $1 million from The Bachelorette 's producers for tying the knot . Lest skeptics snicker that the nuptials were much " I do " about nothing , listen to the man of the cloth who bound them in holy matrimony : " I 've married hundreds of people , and from what I can tell , they really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clint Hufft , a nondenominational minister . " And I do n't always see that . " <p> It 's unlikely the Reverend has ever witnessed the sort of extravaganza staged by the producers , who made sure the wedding was , among other things , a very special rose ceremony ( 30,000 of them were supplied by L.A. florist Mark 's Garden and flown in from Holland and Ecuador at a cost of $250,000 ) . Amid a dizzying swirl of opulence  --  including 5,000 yards of pink ribbon ; $83,000-worth of custom-made Lehr &; Black invitations , place settings and menus ; and a $15,000 wedding cake  --  the couple at the center of it all were shockingly relaxed . " People kept asking me , ' How are you not freaking out ? How are you not shaking ? ' " says Trista . " We were both really calm because we both know this is right . " <p> Behind the scenes , teams of professionals fussed with Trista 's shoes , hair ( " a glamorous ponytail with extensions and gold highlights , " says stylist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding dresses , one for the ceremony and a slinkier lace number for the reception ( see box ) . Yet it was two gifts from Ryan  --  a ring and ring box he carved out of aspen wood and one of his poems hand-embroidered on a silk fabric card  --  that struck her as priceless . " I 'm trying not to cry , " she said after reading it four hours before the service . " My nose will be bright red . " <p> Assembled next to the outdoor gazebo at the Lodge , guests including Trista 's mother , Roseanne Rehn , and Ryan 's folks , Bob and Barbara Sutter , melted when two flower girls pulled ringbearer Nicholas , the 10-month-old son of Trista 's maid of honor , Sara Flood , down the aisle in a miniature red firetruck . At 6:30 p.m. , to the strains of " Here Comes the Bride , " Trista , accompanied by her father , Stan , walked  --  or rather sprinted  --  toward the altar . " She went fast ! " says Weiss . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " A beaming but nervous Ryan watched her approach . " With each step she got closer , I was soothed , " he says . " And when she got there we could both relax . " <p> The couple first read to each other from the classic Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnet that begins " How do I love thee ? Let me count the ways , " then from love letters they had written to each other ( see box ) . After slipping on their platinum-and-diamond wedding bands  --  and with paparazzi helicopters buzzing overhead  --  Trista jumped into her new husband 's arms for their first kiss . " The helicopters were frustrating , but they were oblivious to them , " says Flood . " They were just so enthralled with each other . Watching Ryan 's face was incredible . You could see the power of his love for Trista . " <p> Cameras rolled when the couple were introduced as Mr. and Mrs. Sutter at the reception dinner ( highlight : country singer Brad Paisley surprising Trista with a musical version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but were finally shut off once the newlyweds closed the door of their honeymoon suite decorated with 50 candles , a trail of pink rose petals and 40 gardenias floating in the bathtub . " But the water was cold by the time we got there , " says Trista . " So we decided not to take a bath . " <p> In fact , the lovebirds  --  destined for a 10-day honeymoon in Fiji  --  did n't do much of anything . " We were so tired , we just passed out , " says Ryan , who overlooked the one detail producers did n't plan  --  carrying his bride across the threshold . " Oh , my God , we did n't do that ! " says Trista over lunch with her dream man two days after their dream wedding . " Yeah , we did n't have the key , " he explains . " So someone let us in , and Trista is all excited , so she just ran . " <p> Maybe in Fiji they can work on that whole threshold thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado . " They are crazy about each other , " says bridesmaid Missy Zambelli . " Trista knows she married the man that she is meant to be with . " <p> The Location <p> In the foothills of the Santa Rosa Mountains , the Lodge at Rancho Mirage boasts spectacular views and an A-list clientele . J.Lo has nested there . So have Brad and Jen and Frank Sinatra 's kin . Now the 240-room resort is offering Ryan and Trista 's Luxury Escape ( $2,450 for two ) , which includes two nights in the Gerald Ford Presidential Suite . Yep , he stayed there too . <p> Rehearsal Dinner <p> The theme was Vail , Colo. , in honor of Ryan and Trista 's home , which explains the Rocky Mountain chocolates on each table , next to the individual place cards ( right ) . Drinks too were personalized : Guests sipped the Trista Pink ( a blend of creme de noya and creme de cacao ) and the Ryanarita ( a Jose Cuervo-Grand Marnier mix ) . Then everyone chowed down on shrimp , oysters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 9:35 p.m. , but the party was hardly over . " Sorry , guys , I had to do that for the cameras , " she said . " We will be hanging out and having a good time , because we 're not really going to bed ! " <p> The Look <p> <p> THE FLOWERS Trista 's bouquet was made of rare pale-pink peonies wrapped in white silk and Swarovski crystals . There were also 12 dozen roses with Trista and Ryan 's pictures printed on one petal of each rose . <p> <p> THE DRESSES Trista 's $70,000 Badgley Mischka gown ( top left ) was touched up by the designers on site . For the reception , she switched into a Badgley Mischka Chantilly lace dress ( left ) with a puckered satin bustier and a crystal-encrusted midriff . <p> <p> THE SHOES Trista 's size-6M Stuart Weitzman wedding shoes ( bottom left ) had 282 diamonds encrusted on the buckles and straps and cost $50,000 . <p> <p> THE RINGS The couple exchanged $25,000 diamond-and-platinum wedding bands ( above ) by Tacori . Trista got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2-ct. band pave-set with round-cut diamonds . <p> <p> THE NECKLACE Trista wore a loaned $1 million Tacori necklace with 1,000 diamonds ( top ) but nixed heavy earrings weighed down by 200 diamonds . <p> <p> THE MAKEUP Makeup whiz Laura Merrcier and staff glammed up the wedding party at a cost of $73,000 . <p> The Wedding Cake <p> Why a cake that 's half dark chocolate , half white ? " Trista really wanted Ryan to be part of it , " explains Leigh Grode of Cake Divas . " Dark chocolate is really masculine . " The cake also has some feminine frills : more than 1,000 sugar roses and cherry blossoms . <p> BOB AND ESTELLA : IS IT OVER ? <p> " We want to make it last , " Estella Gardinier , 28 , said just last month of her romance with The Bachelor 's Bob Guiney , 32 . But at the wedding of Trista and Ryan , the couple spent much of their time apart , fueling rumors of a breakup . " He pays more attention to me than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't even touched each other all night , " said a female friend of Trista 's mom . " Not even one hug . " <p> Neither Guiney nor Gardinier will comment on a possible split . " I 'm having a blast ! " she said at the reception . " I 'm with Bob ! How can I not have fun ? He 's doing shots of vodka and I 'm drinking wine . " Still , not exactly a toast to their future . <p> The Next Bachelorette <p> She lost Bob to Estella on this fall 's Bachelor , but Meredith Phillips is n't moping . The 30-year-old L.A. makeup artist will be the new Bachelorette beginning Jan. 14 . " She 's smart , " says show creator Mike Fleiss . " Plus she 's very sexy .
