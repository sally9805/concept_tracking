It 's all Chicago , all the time , at the Windy City Bed-and-Breakfast Inn , a Victorian house built in 1886 in the Lincoln Park section of town . Owners Andy Shaw , a reporter for the local ABC-TV station , and Mary Shaw celebrate the city in every possible way , save handing out White Sox to their guests . <P> Ann Sather 's famous Scandinavian cinnamon buns appear regularly on the breakfast tray , bottles of Goose Island beer cool in the fridge , and Chicago-style blues , jazz and Irish music waft through the house . One almost expects to see Cubs , Bears and Bulls out in the garden , landscaped with indigenous flowers by the Chicago Botanical Garden . <P> The Shaws pay their greatest homage , though , to Chicago writers . A guest can curl up in the queen-size bed in the Sara Paretsky Room and get lost in a V.I . Warshawski mystery . Or creep in on little cat feet to the Carl Sandburg Room . The Mike Royko Room , with its antique three-quarter bed , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkel Suite in the carriage house provides a break from Working . <P> Lincoln Park itself , just blocks away , is a lovely urban oasis on the edge of Lake Michigan , with a zoo and a new nature museum . The bustling Lincoln Park neighborhood has movies , shopping , and restaurants that serve everything from tapas to Thai . The Windy City B and B is only two miles from downtown 's North Michigan Avenue  --  known to serious shoppers as the Gold Coast  --  not to mention the Art Institute , the Sears Tower and the theater district
