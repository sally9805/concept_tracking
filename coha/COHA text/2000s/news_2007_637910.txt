<p> Corporations hire economists to get a crystal ball into the future . Not Frank MacInnis , CEO of Emcor Group , who says , " I am my own economist . " The construction industry is sensitive to the economic winds , yet MacInnis has steered Emcor stock up 1,360% since becoming CEO in 1994 . MacInnis , 60 , spoke with USA TODAY corporate management reporter Del Jones about predicting swings . <p> Q : What is your track record at economic forecasting ? <p> A : I 'm in a difficult , low-margin business , and we 've reported 47 consecutive quarters of profitability , which is hard to do . We 've managed through several economic cycles and made a lot of consistent money due to right decisions . <p> Q : Is n't it easier to listen to economists than to play do-it-yourself ? <p> A : I 've been a CEO for 30 years . Sometimes you know things . You do n't know how you know them , but you know . It 's nice to agree with smart people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Q : If you follow the herd , at least you wo n't be alone out on a limb if you 're wrong . <p> A : Insecure CEOs look for air cover . That 's not a valid defense . We 're each paddling our own canoe , and it should n't be an excuse if I make the same mistake that others are making . I 'm paid to think for myself . <p> Q : Are government economic reports helpful or hooey ? <p> A : Information in all aspects is getting better . The interpretation is a whole other thing . You could have read the Census Bureau report on construction activity for any month of this year and seen bad news for Emcor . Nothing could be further from the truth . Housing construction continues to decline dramatically , but non-residential construction is growing , and in some segments , such as hospitality and gaming , at dramatic rates . <p> Q : To which reports do you pay the most attention ? Which do you dismiss outright ? <p> A : I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to employment statistics . Employing people is expensive and time consuming . If a sector is adding people , it is making a serious and expensive bet , a significant sign of faith in the future . <p> Q : What is a time series ? Do you rely on them ? <p> A : It 's a basket of economic indicators that are germane to your own business . In our business , for example , you could look at indices like employment , the Census Bureau construction reports , real estate absorption reports and interest rate fluctuations . Take that basket and apply degrees of weight to each and compare it to the past . It 's a complicated way of doing what I do with my gut . There are too many moving parts in a time series analysis . A seasoned CEO instinctively applies the right weight to this factor or that . For example , I have an idea about how high interest rates can go up before it impacts my customers ' decisions about construction projects . <p> Q : Rely on gut , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I retain a lot of what I read . When the time comes , I 'm confident in my instinctive reactions to be comfortable about going with my gut . More often , a prompt decision , even if wrong , is better than a late decision . Emcor did not lose a dime from the dot-com collapse . <p> Q : Many saw the dot-com bubble , but it proved difficult to know when that bubble would burst . How do you dodge pain without missing opportunity ? <p> A : Asset allocation . Every CEO has a kitty for hot markets , but must not plunge in with an outsized portion of resources . The guardianship of capital is one of the CEO 's primary responsibilities . You do not avoid apparent bubbles as long as you 're reasonably confident in your ability to manage your way out of them . We looked at dot-com customers and decided that the companies were running on blue sky and hot air . <p> Q : Are there any existing bubbles now to be leery of ? <p> A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very measured and controlled way . <p> Q : Emcor 's clients include 75% of the Fortune 500 companies . Do you learn from them ? <p> A : We see our customers making significant construction decisions that involve large capital deployment , and we conclude that they must be counting on profitability . <p> On the other side , we know when customers make defensive moves in anticipation of sector downturns . If a customer begins to lengthen their payment periods , they are concerned about their liquidity . <p> I 've found this to be a useful guide to impending recession even before people talk about it formally . <p> Q : Some companies have unusual indicators , such as tracking cardboard box makers . Will we find you on the overpass counting trucks going down the interstate ? <p> A : I do n't think so . But a CEO has to read as much as possible , not just about his own business , but about broad trends . <p> Q : Alan Greenspan made economic forecasts in the bathtub . Does that have merit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you ought to be . <p> Q : How do you keep emotions at bay ? How do you guard against being overly optimistic or pessimistic ? <p> A : The construction industry is made up of optimistic people , some to a fault . It 's not easy to curb enthusiasm and understand that there are dispassionate economic forces at work . <p> I impose discipline by telling myself that my major job is watching for the next recession . I 'm looking every day for evidence . I know it 's coming , I just do n't know when . My job in a nutshell is looking for the danger signals , notwithstanding my innate optimism . <p> Q : Is a recession coming ? <p> A : The fundamental indicators that I use suggest that the prospects for non-residential construction and for facility management are very good . This is not because I 'm Pollyanna . I 'm not . I take seriously my responsibility to look for and find danger signals and translate them into action . <p> Q : How far out does your optimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say I can see out more than 18 to 24 months . It looks good for that long , barring the unknowable . <p> Q : You say you 're not Pollyanna-ish , but is it equally risky to be too conservative and miss economic upswings ? <p> A : Certainly . If you do n't trust your instincts and invest in advance of improvement , you will be sorry . You will reduce your performance on the topside while condemning yourself to performance with the pack on the downside . <p> Q : When you see a recession coming , how will you respond ? <p> A : The same way that each of us makes personal decisions about asset allocations . If you have personal money to invest , you might allocate a portion to speculative investments like real estate in Bora Bora . That 's what every CEO does in a nutshell , decides how to allocate capital between risk and reward . Every company needs to be willing to take a measured chance and take advantage of trends . But it 's a terrible mistake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q : You once built pipelines between Iran and Iraq . How crucial is the price of energy to the U.S. economy ? <p> A : I 've been surprised by the resilience of the American and world economy to oil price fluctuations . No oil-producing nation is in a position to unilaterally withdraw oil from the world market for long . Iran has changed dramatically since the time I lived there . It is a very young nation with a host of difficult social and educational problems that require steady income in order to help solve and keep the present administration in power . <p> Q : Say we bomb Iran . What happens to our economy ? <p> A : It might be a similar situation to the oil shock of the ' 70s where you get a period of overreaction . An increase in the price of oil only means that other sources of oil are made more economical . <p> Q : Can you read the economic tea leaves of China or other foreign economies ? <p> A : I certainly can not . There are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differing laws , differing customs and the differing policies of governments . It 's one reason why Emcor expands primarily at home . China is only for the bravest and best capitalized.
