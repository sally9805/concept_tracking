Intense and emotional , LARRY BOWA needs to keep his cool-and the focus on winning , not himself-if the well-fortified Phillies are to live up to red-hot expectations BY RANDY MILLER // // Larry Bowa was being Larry Bowa . The Phillies ' manager , intense as ever at age 58 , did n't make it through a week 's worth of Grapefruit League games without feeling the need to blow off some steam . And so he did . Although no clubhouse food tables at the Phillies ' spring training complex in Clearwater , FIa. , were overturned and no players were given the Bob Knight treatment , Bowa was angry enough to phone a Philadelphia all-sports radio station , go on the air and portray a side of himself that Phillies fans have loved for more than three decades . On this day , Bowa felt the need to defend himself by hammering away at Philadelphia print journalists . A week later , Bowa was back on the same station to keep his Us-vs. - Them theme going , this time defending Phillies general manager Ed Wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime Philadelphia Daily News columnist Bill Conlin for going bonkers on Phillies beat writers the previous day . Bowa really went off this time , calling Conlin a senile old man who is stirring up trouble because he 's bored with his life . " He threw in that I 'm so fat I ca n't fit through the doorway , " says Conlin , who was on the beat during Bowa 's entire run as star shortstop with the Phillies from 1970 through 1981 . " I have a senile , old-man 's premonition , though , that if I ever get skinny enough to fit through the door to the office of the Phillies manager , a different guy will be sitting in the chair . Larry Bowa has been rubbing people the wrong way since his first Phillies spring training camp in 1967 and shows no sign of wearing out . He 's the Energizer Bunny of abrasiveness . " There also was the spring day Bowa joked that his exploits with writers ought to be chronicled on the big screen in One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play Bowa ? " Nicholson , " he said with authority and a smile . Auditions may be held at a theater near you for the parts of Scott Rolen and Tyler Houston , former Phillies who have sparred with Bowa since he returned to the Phillies as manager in 2001 . Are you wondering what in the name of Hal McRae Flying Tape Recorders is going on during a spring in which the Phillies simply hoped for smooth sailing ? " There 's a lot of criticism that 's not warranted , not warranted at all , " Bowa says . Actually , as far as the Phillies are concerned , the only real news in the first half of spring training was injuries to three important players . Reigning National League home run king Jim Thome fractured his right middle finger and was to miss three weeks ; new star closer Billy Wagner suffered an inflamed left middle finger and did n't throw off the mound for three weeks , and No. 1 starter Kevin Millwood bruised his right shoulder in a fielding drill and missed a turn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowa has been relaxed around his team this spring . The manager showed up for work one day wearing baggy hip-hop clothes purchased by shortstop Jimmy Rollins , and Bowa has been seen eating lunch with players in the clubhouse . Around his team , he shows little sign of feeling extra pressure to win now because , as he puts it , his expectation for every season-no matter the talent-is to win the World Series . " Larry 's been great this spring , " two-time All-Star catcher Mike lieberthal says . " I know about his personality , but we have veteran players and leadership . Once you do get used to him , you know how he is . Some players are affected by it , some players are n't . Even Bowa says it 's our team and we 're the ones who have control of the situation . " By the April 5 season opener in Pittsburgh , all of the club 's wounded big guns are expected to be ready . The Phillies , after many years of bad baseball before contending for a postseason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular choice to unseat the downsized Atlanta Braves and Florida Marlins as beasts of the N.L. East . While many other franchises have serious payroll issues , the Phillies are conducting business as if they 've become a miniature version of the Yankees after years of having what seemed to be a small-revenue budget . With beautiful $346 million Citizens Bank Park opening its gates in south Philly next month , the Phillies have been loading up the past two winters . They added third baseman David Bell , Thome and Millwood after the 2002 season , then took on pitchers Eric Milton , Tim Worrell , Roberto Hernandez and Wagner this winter . The Phillies now have a solid starting eight , four one-time AllStars ( Millwood , Milton , Randy Wolf and Vicente Padilla ) in one of baseball 's few five-deep starting rotations and a very good back end of the bullpen . Yet here 's the question that Bowa and the Phillies keep hearing , one they 're tired of hearing : Can the manager control his emotions in a summer in which the Phillies are supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 years ? Ask Bowa that question and you 're sure to set him off because , believe it or not , major blowups really have n't been an issue during his mildly successful run as Phillies manager , which has included two winning seasons in three years and a 252-233 overall mark since taking over a ballclub that previously had reeled off seven consecutive losing records under managers Jim Fregosi and Terry Francona . " I 'm proud of the fact that starting the first year I got here , we changed the attitude , " Bowa says . " It 's not OK to play under .500 . " On his reputation as John McEnroe without a racket , Bowa is very defensive . he says he does n't care how he 's perceived anymore , yet his actions say otherwise . " Why do I have to prove to people that I 'm a human being and not some ( jerk ) who goes around with a whip and slashes people around the neck every day ? " he asks . " It feels like if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if do get mad it 's the same old Larry . After a while , that gets tiresome . " Bowa acknowledges one personality flaw . The biggest complaint from players is n't Bowa 's infrequent tantrums but , instead , his show of disgust in the dugout when something goes wrong . he waves his arms and sometimes mutters to coaches loud enough for players to overhear . Management has asked Bowa to better contain his angst , and the coaching staff has tried to keep him under control . Bowa even attended anger-management classes two winters ago . " I 'm going to tell you right now that I have got to improve in that , " Bowa says . " If it means faking it , it has to be done . And I can do it . But sometimes I get caught up . If you 're in a 1-1 game and you give up a grand slam , it 's hard to sit there and just go , OK , we 're down 5-1 . ' I know that , but on the other hand I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You just do n't go , Oh , it 's burning . ' ' " There has been speculation Bowa is on a short leash-that Phillies special assistant Charlie Manuel , a former manager in Cleveland who is tight with Thome , could be the manager-in-waiting . True or not , Phillies management never has stopped publicly and privately backing Bowa , who was given another strong sign of support last December when the club exercised his 2005 option and added club options for 2006 and 2007 . " I know where I stand with Eddie Wade , " Bowa says . " That 's nice to know . I 'm not worried at all about my job . " Take a stroll around the Phillies ' clubhouse and you 'll hear a few gripes from a mostly veteran group that includes allies , enemies and others who are indifferent . But every player from Thome , the undisputed team leader , to the 25th man believes the Phillies are on the verge of greatness . So does Darren Daulton , a spring training catching instructor who was a leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champions . " These guys are good , and they know they 're good " he says . " Now they just have to put it together . The pieces are there . " Bowa , who earned his reputation for being a hothead during his playing days and enhanced it during an unsuccessful first managerial job with the Padres in 1987 and 1988 , always will be regarded as more Lou Piniella than Joe Torre . But you might be surprised to know that Bowa 's players have seen very few full-blown outbursts . Last year , he erupted once all season , on August 28 , after the Phillies were shut out on a getaway day in Montreal . Bowa woke up his team-the defeat was Philadelphia 's ninth in 10 games-by throwing a fit . And although the Phillies rebounded the next day by winning in New York and went on a 9-1 run that kept them in the wild-card chase until the final week of the season , a bizarre sequence of events led to more Bowa bashing . The night after Bowa 's tirade , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home runs last season after belting 37 in 2002 , avoided shaking his manager 's hand after going deep at Shea Stadium . The next morning , Houston , one of the league 's best pinch hitters and a buddy of Burrell 's , was blamed for orchestrating the snub and was released . Houston then phoned Phillies beat writers and unleashed wicked insults at Bowa , saying the entire team hated him , which led to the manager calling Houston " a loser . " Angry and hurt , Bowa pleaded for writers to ask Thome and Bell what they thought . Bell defended his manager , but Thome and many others opted to stay out of it , which sparked baseball columnists near and far to speculate that Bowa had lost his team . // HAPPY HOTHEADS // Mention the " lost his team " assertion , and Bowa goes into his best Johnnie Cochran defense . " I had one what you call " bigleague snap " last year , and if you checked papers all over the country you 'd think I was a maniac , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception . And it starts in our media . all I hear is , " This guy 's out of control , he 's crazy , he lost the clubhouse . ' Whatever . " There has been a controversy in each of Bowa 's three seasons as Phillies manager . In 2001 , a published reported quoted an unnamed Phillies player saying " 22 of 25 " play- ers were against Bowa . In 2002 , Bowa feuded with Rolen , who bashed the organization after turning down an extension that could have been worth $140 million before being traded to St. Louis . Last year , Burrell and Houston relit the torch . " In the three years I 've been here , there have been three alleged revolts , " Bowa says . " Nobody wants to play for me . " Larry ca n't get along with his players , they hate Larry 's guts . ' " I get along good with my players for the most part . There are a couple players that I did n't like , and we clashed . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play as hard as they can for me . I can honesty tell you , in the years I 've been here , you ai n't seen my players quit one inning ever . EVER . And they wo n't . But I 'm going to be me . " His players , new and old , have come to understand Larry Bowa . " Larry 's a fiery guy , " Millwood says . " As long as we 're all men here and realize that 's just the way Bowa is and that 's OK , we can win because he does n't walk around criticizing people and he does n't throw fits . " Wagner has a lot of Bowa in him . He , too , is intense . But like Millwood , he 's going to do everything in his power to make sure the only thing worth worrying about in the Land of Cheesesteaks is winning . " I think people have got to quit looking at Bowa and quit making a big deal out of him , " Wagner says . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accepted among his players for who he is .
