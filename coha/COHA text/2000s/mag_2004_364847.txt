Did Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , even as he was renouncing terrorism to win the favor of the Bush Administration , really order a hit on Saudi Arabia 's de facto ruler , Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al Saud ? Or are the Saudis pushing trumped-up charges ? Libyan officials deny the accusations , Saudi sources stand by them , and U.S. officials  --  while saying " the Saudis are hyping " the story  --  are n't quite sure what to think . <P> The explosive allegations are based in part on the testimony of Abdurahman Alamoudi , an American Muslim leader arrested last fall at Dulles airport , who claimed he was told by Gaddafi last June that he wanted the prince dead . ( Alamoudi 's lawyer will say only that his client is " cooperating fully . " ) The alleged plot followed a public rebuke at an Arab summit last year , when Abdullah said to Gaddafi , " You are a liar , and your grave awaits you . " <P> The clashing charges are the latest example of the two countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaddafi railed against the pro-U.S . Saudi monarchy , and Libyan officials claim that the Saudis are funding Libyan opposition groups . A Libyan source close to Gaddafi says , " Those groups tried to kill the leader twice , " and adds that Mohamed Ismael , a Libyan in Saudi custody as a suspect in the alleged plot against Abdullah , was merely financing Saudi reformers . The source says the accusations are part of a Saudi smear campaign against Saudi dissidents . For their part , fumes a well-placed Saudi source , " we are fed up with these people . It is better for us to be rid of this regime . " Whatever the truth of the allegations against Gaddafi , the feeling seems to be mutual . <P>  --  By Timothy J.
