The past century saw substantial refinement in the way in which we interpret the Moon 's history  --  and substantial enhancement in our means of capturing lunar essence in photographs . <p> The Moon is the only alien world whose surface can be explored in detail by Earth-bound observers . Through even a modest telescope the lunar terrain offers a rewarding spectacle . <p> Many professional astronomers feel no affinity for Earth 's celestial companion , however . A gibbous Moon floods the night sky with reflected sunlight , swamping the highly-prized photons arriving from distant stars and galaxies . Moreover , moonlight halves the amount of time each month during which these objects can be studied . And telescopic views of the Moon can not match the details of photographs returned by the Apollo program , as well as electronic images obtained by unmanned lunar orbiters and landers . Consequently , after the start of space programs in the United States and the former Soviet Union , scientific study of the Moon moved from the province of the astronomer to that of the geologist and planetary scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon at the beginning of the 1900s , when the study of the lunar surface was still the domain of optical Earth-bound telescopes ? In 1904 , the great observer Edward E. Barnard wrote , " It is a fact that the Moon has been badly neglected visually , in recent years , and that its study has been relegated to the amateur with small instrumental means . The large telescopes of today have never seriously taken up its study . Yet there is perhaps no object in the sky that would more probably repay the careful observer than a close study of the Moon 's surface . " This surface , Barnard concluded , would " offer a rich field for careful and original investigation with sufficiently powerful telescopic means . " <p> It may be that some astronomers felt the same way as William W. Campbell , who wrote of his interest in lunar craters in 1920 when he was director of Lick Observatory . This interest had been sparked while he was " engaged in showing the Moon through the 36-inch refractor to many thousands of Saturday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically dealt with stars and planetary nebulae , but he appears to have had at least a part-time interest in the Moon , and engaged in the debate over the origin of lunar craters . <p> Even so , Barnard 's comments seem somewhat curious , given that in the 1890s several notable observatories had embarked on the production of the first large-scale photographic atlases of the Moon . Although only a small number of professional astronomers devoted substantial amounts of telescope time to lunar observations , one of those who did was well known to Barnard . Edward S. Holden , the first director of Lick Observatory , started a photographic campaign in 1890 , while Barnard was still a Lick astronomer before moving to Yerkes in 1895 . At that time the flagship of Lick Observatory was the great 36-inch refractor on Mount Hamilton . This telescope would be used for two extensive programs of lunar photography that have left a considerable pictorial legacy , one of which harkens back to a time when the past history of the Moon was as mysterious as is the evolution of distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photography at Lick Observatory dates back to 1888 , the year in which the 36-inch refractor , then the world 's largest telescope , was placed into service . In August of that year , Lick astronomer Sherburne W. Burnham used this refractor to obtain a number of images of the Moon on glass photographic plates . These plates , commonly referred to as " negatives , " were 8 by 10 inches in size . The image of the lunar disk recorded on them had a diameter of about 5.5 inches . When positive copies on glass were made of these images , enlarged by a factor of two , and viewed with a small eyepiece , an effective magnification of about 1100x could be obtained . <p> The quality of the early plates captivated Edward Holden , and he decided to embark on a multi-year effort to photograph the Moon . His scrutiny of Burnham 's plates lead him to expect that many new details of the lunar landscape would be discovered . As the Observatory director , Holden was in charge of assigning observing time on the 36-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another two to James E. Keeler , with the first-half of Saturday night in most weeks being allocated to public viewing . Two nights a week he reserved for himself , and from 1890 to 1897 he devoted many of these to obtaining photographic plates of the Moon at a large number of different phases . He was assisted by a number of Lick astronomers , and from 1892 by a regular photographic assistant , Allen L. Colton . Holden planned to produce an atlas of enlarged prints derived from the plates . In justification of this effort , he wrote in 1893 that if " lunar geology is ever to be studied in detail , it must have such pictures as a basis . " <p> Holden 's program was not without detractors , however . Ironically , some of his own staff astronomers proved to be among his main critics . In fact , Holden 's lunar program illustrates some of the tensions and differences of opinion that arose between him and a number of the Lick astronomers . For example , a systematic but repetitive program of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimental temperament , but it was seen as rather mundane research by other of the Lick astronomers . <p> Holden 's use of the refractor for lunar work was the source of several acutely felt grievances to Edward Barnard . Although he had been blessed with great visual acuity and observing skill , Barnard found his access to the 36-inch refractor being restricted by Holden . Prior to 1892 he was assigned to the Observatory 's 12-inch Clark refractor and other smaller telescopes . Barnard was an insatiable observer , eager to be on the leading edge of astronomical research , but he was extremely frustrated by his negligible access to the 36-inch . By contrast , Holden was devoting much of his access to lunar photography , which Barnard considered a misuse of the telescope . In fact , the best definition on the Moon was obtained when the 36-inch telescope was stopped down to an aperture of 8 inches , and the great refractor was often used in this mode for Holden 's lunar photography . <p> Barnard was particularly capable at photographic work . Indeed , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunar plates taken by Holden . He was critical of their quality . Some were out of focus , while others had been blurred by telescope vibration . Nonetheless , some fine plates did result from the lunar program . This , however , was another source of conflict between Holden and his staff . Colton , in particular , felt that many of the best plates in the series had been taken by him , and that he was not being given due recognition . <p> It may be that Barnard 's lamentation quoted above about the neglect of serious lunar study at major observatories was intended as much to suggest his opinion of Holden 's lunar work , as to chastise other of his professional colleagues for their aloofness towards the queen of the night . Barnard 's relations with his director became so strained and acrimonious that he eventually left Lick Observatory in 1895 . <p> Despite his discontent with Holden 's lunar program , Barnard did attempt some rather eclectic photography of the Moon from Mount Hamilton . He used the 12-inch refractor to photograph the Earth-lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1895 he obtained photographs of a total lunar eclipse with an instrument known as the " Willard lens . " This 6-inch diameter wide-angle lens , when suitably mounted , gained distinction for its use by Barnard in panoramic photography of the Milky Way . The eclipse photographs were " made to test the possible existence of a lunar satellite . " Although Barnard was not surprised by the negative outcome of this search , he seems to have held a rather singular regard for his efforts , noting in the Astrophysical Journal that he had " certainly never seen such exquisite pictures of the Moon as those made during totality with the Willard lens . " Was this extraordinary statement another dig at Holden 's lunar plates ? The Great Crater Debate <p> The year 1893 , which marked the midpoint of Holden 's photographic program , is a notable one in the history of lunar studies . In that year the U. S. geologist G. Karl Gilbert published a paper entitled " The Moon 's Face : A Study of the Moon and Its Features . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are consistent with an impact origin . Up to that time many in the astronomical community held that lunar craters were the products of volcanic activity . Gilbert 's paper , however , received less attention than it deserved , with the result that the debate over the origin of lunar craters continued for another half-century or so . <p> To Holden 's credit , he recognized the importance of Gilbert 's work , although he does not appear to have accepted Gilbert 's conclusions . A transcription of several paragraphs from an address that Gilbert gave to the National Academy of Sciences in 1892 was printed in one of the earliest volumes of the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific . Accompanying this transcription , Holden wrote : " Dr. Gilbert is the first geologist of high standing to give his authority to the hypothesis that lunar craters have , in general , been formed by the bombardment of the lunar surface by meteorites . " <p> By contrast , Holden commented that his " own studies on Moon photographs do not lead me to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , Holden argued that the large lunar crater Copernicus was of volcanic origin , and that its topography as seen in the Lick plates was analogous to those of the volcanoes of the Islands of Hawaii 's . He argued , for example , that the terraced inner rim of Copernicus was reminiscent of terraces found within the caldera of Kilauea . The ejecta blanket , a ring of rough terrain that surrounds Copernicus , he attributed to lava flows . In Holden 's words , " every feature which we see in the crater Copernicus seems to have its analogue if not its counterpart on this small island of Hawaii . " He admitted , however , that such explanations may not work as well for other lunar craters . <p> Although Holden was mistaken about the origin of lunar craters like Copernicus , it would be churlish to impugn him too harshly on this matter , as many other astronomers thought similarly . Indeed , a subsequent Lick director , the aforementioned William W. Campbell , argued against the impact theory more than twenty years after Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proposed in 1893 that the bright rays of lunar craters were produced by the deposition of dust from volcanic eruptions . At the time of Holden 's work , the origin of lunar craters was still very much a matter of debate . Holden 's Atlas <p> Holden publicized the Lick lunar photographs extensively , although he wrote few papers for scientific journals about what he had learned from them . Some plates were reproduced in articles that Holden wrote for popular magazines of the time . Some were printed in professional journals . Others were exhibited at public expositions , museums , and scientific meetings . Holden gave copies of plates to astronomers in both the United States and overseas , some of whom worked on making enlargements from them , such as Ladislaus Weinek , director of the Observatory of Prague . Weinek felt that drawings could most effectively highlight the contrasts seen in photographic enlargements . He developed his own techniques for enlarging the Lick plates , and painstakingly copied the details onto hand drawings . <p> The quality of the Lick lunar plates stirred something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of notes published in the British journal The Observatory in the 1890s . There was considerable discussion as to whether photographic techniques were able to document features as small as could be seen by visual inspection at a telescope eyepiece . Holden must have been acutely aware of this debate , as he would occasionally publish short notes advertising new , hitherto unseen , craters visible on the Lick plates . Although such notes might appear to trivialize Holden 's efforts , it is worth emphasizing that his work was being done at a time when astronomers were still divided over the usefulness of photography in astronomical research . Holden 's notes were meant to demonstrate his contention that photography could record details on the lunar surface as fine as those discernible through visual observation , a contention that was not unanimous . <p> Holden had intended to produce an unbound atlas of lunar photographs comprising sixty sheets or more , together with an index map . However , his plans appear to have come to only partial fruition . Under the title Lick Observatory Atlas of the Moon , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38.4 inches to the Moon 's diameter . In 1896-1897 Holden distributed these as separate sheets to a number of observatories and individuals . <p> There may be several reasons why this atlas was not completed . The cost of printing even a limited number of the lunar photographs proved to be considerable . In addition , Weinek was also working on an atlas of enlargements and drawings based in part on the Lick plates . There was also competition from a major lunar photographic atlas being compiled at l'Observatoire de Paris by Maurice Loewy and Pierre Puiseux . Indeed , the consensus of the astronomical community seemed to be that the plates of the Paris atlas were superior to those of the Lick effort . Regardless of the factors that may have been at work , Holden 's resignation and departure from Lick Observatory in 1897 , under less than agreeable circumstances , evidently discouraged and/or prevented him from pursuing his atlas publication any further . <p> Whatever the shortcomings of Holden 's lunar program , it seems only appropriate to give due credit . As Walter Bryant wrote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moon was first systematized at Lick Observatory in 1890 , " albeit with other efforts following closely on the heels . Barnard 's comments notwithstanding , Edward Holden had been Lick Observatory 's most ardent pursuer of lunar studies . Second Lunar Light <p> Holden 's vision of extensive photographic coverage of the Moon using the 36-inch refractor was most effectively realized by Lick astronomer Joseph H. Moore and the observatory photographer J. Fred Chappell in the period from 1937 to 1947 . By this time , photographic emulsions had improved considerably since the era of Holden 's efforts . In addition , a special camera was constructed which used a wedge-shaped shutter that resulted in a more uniform exposure across the lunar image . Plates were taken at times when the conditions at Mount Hamilton were at their best . Moore and Chappell consequently obtained an exquisite set of photographs showing the lunar nearside at many different phases . As Dinsmore Alter and Paul Roques of Griffith Observatory wrote in 1955 : " Some better individual lunar photographs have been taken , but no other series equals this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moore-Chappell series , plus enlargements , were included in a folio of large prints published in 1940 under the title Astronomical photographs taken at the Lick observatory . This work appears to be one of the few instances in which pictures from the series were published under the direct auspices of Lick Observatory . The Observatory does maintain an official slide set that includes a number of the Moore-Chappell pictures . These have appeared in numerous astronomical books , atlases , and journals . <p> Throughout 1946 and 1947 the magazine Sky &; Telescope published on the back cover of its monthly editions eighteen enlargements derived from two of the Moore-Chappell plates , one of the first-quarter Moon and a matching one taken at third quarter . These proved to be very popular . By joining all eighteen covers together in a mosaic , one might produce a reproduction of the entire near-side lunar disk about 35 inches in diameter similar to the scale of Holden 's earlier atlas . The interested reader could thereby construct his or her own Lick lunar atlas ! The magazine also provided labeled maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sense Sky &; Telescope realized Holden 's plan of a lunar atlas based on plates from the 36-inch refractor . In a similar context , selections of the Moore-Chappell pictures were included along with prints from four other major observatories in the scientifically influential Photographic Lunar Atlas ( University of Chicago Press ) compiled by Gerard P. Kuiper and colleagues . The Age of Apollo <p> In the early 1960s NASA 's Apollo program gave an urgent new impetus to ground-based telescopic mapping of the Moon . This led to a third era of lunar studies with the Lick 36-inch refractor . Plates from the Moore-Chappell series , along with material from many other observatories , were used in the production of a series of maps of the lunar nearside by the Aeronautical Chart and Information Center ( ACIC ) of the U.S. Air Force . In addition , between 1961 and 1966 the Astrogeology Branch of the U. S. Geological Survey produced a number of detailed geological maps of the lunar nearside . These built on the ACIC charts and telescopic photographs , in addition to new programs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Don E. Wilhelms at the Lick 36-inch refractor and other observatories . The aim of the USGS efforts was not only to support NASA lunar missions , but also to determine a comparative age sequence among lunar landforms , from which could be deciphered a relative history of the lunar surface . Actual age measurements of this surface had to await the rock samples returned to Earth by Apollo astronauts . <p> In a way the geological maps of the Moon made in the early to mid 1960s represent a fitting culmination to the programs of lunar photography carried out with the Lick Observatory 36-inch refractor . While plates taken with this telescope made up only a fraction of the raw data used by the ACIC and USGS in the creation of their maps , there is something appealing in the thought that after many years , lunar photographs from the great refractor were being distilled into hard data at the hands of scientists ideally trained for their interpretation  --  geologists .
