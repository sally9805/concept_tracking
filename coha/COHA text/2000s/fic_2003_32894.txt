311 Pelican Court By Debbie Macomber Harlequin Enterprises , Ltd . Harlequin Enterprises , Ltd . From the moment Rosie Cox entered Cedar Cove 's divorce court , she 'd felt a renewed sense of failure - not to mention betrayal . Who would n't feel that way ? After seventeen years of what she 'd believed to be a reasonably good marriage , Zach 's infidelity was the last thing she 'd expected . He 'd never openly admitted to the affair . She had n't found her husband in a compromising situation , had n't found any concrete evidence - no matchbooks from expensive restaurants , no jewelry receipts or motel bills - but in her heart she knew . A wife always does . Rosie owned up to the truth - she was angry and she 'd expressed that anger by making this divorce as complicated and difficult as she possibly could . Why should she go easy on Zach or walk away from their marriage without one hell of a fight ? And fight she had , with both fists raised . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand , she realized she 'd made another mistake . Rosie had assumed that once the divorce was granted , the anger and bitterness of these dreadful months would be lifted . Wrong again . An even heavier burden had been added . When the joint custody agreement she and Zach had so carefully worked out , point by point , was presented to Judge Olivia Lockhart , the judge had rejected it . Instead , Judge Lockhart had stated that it was emotionally detrimental to kids to shuffle them between residences every few days . Allison and Eddie needed stable lives , according to Judge Lockhart , and they had n't asked for the divorce . Some people considered the judge innovative , Rosie thought , disgruntled . How about interfering ? Or out of her mind ? Because - of all the crazy settlements - she 'd awarded the children their house . That meant Rosie and Zach would be the ones moving in and out . Talk about ridiculous ! Talk about impossible . Now that the divorce was final , Rosie and Zach would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they 'd agreed to were starting to hit Rosie and she had n't even left the courtroom . " Rosie , " Sharon Castor , her attorney , said as soon as they were in the silent hallway outside the courtroom . " We have to meet with your ex-husband . " One look told Rosie that Sharon was as flustered as she was herself . Otto Benson , Zach 's lawyer , joined them . Although he remained outwardly calm , his face was tense . She dared not glance in Zach 's direction . In fact , she 'd avoided looking at her ex-husband from the moment she 'd walked into the courtroom . " Let 's get a conference room and discuss the details , " Zach 's attorney said . Rosie peered at Zach , standing behind his lawyer . He did n't seem any happier than she was with this decision , but she 'd keel over in a dead faint before she let him know how she felt . " Rosie and I should be able to work this out ourselves , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way everything had gone so far , that suggestion was n't promising . " If you remember , it took us weeks of haggling to come up with this joint custody agreement , " she pointed out . She enjoyed reminding him what a jerk he 'd been . Rosie supposed Zach was hoping to avoid more attorneys ' fees . Too bad . If he ended up with less money to spend on his girlfriend , that was n't her concern . Fists clenched , Zach snarled something under his breath . Probably just as well she could n't hear it , Rosie decided , proud of her own display of self-control . " What makes you think we 're capable of agreeing to anything without a mediator ? " she asked sarcastically . " Fine , " Zach muttered , with a pout reminiscent of their nine-year-old son . Staring at him now , Rosie had trouble believing she 'd ever loved Zachary Cox . Not only was he smug and argumentative and self-righteous , he had no idea what it meant to be a husband and father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , his appearance proclaimed his success as a businessman , a professional . Although , in her opinion , anyone with half a brain would instantly peg him for an accountant . He had that narrowed look about his dark eyes , as if he spent too many hours a day squinting at columns of tiny numbers . Despite that , he was appealing to the eye with his broad shoulders - which nicely set off his expensive suit - and thick , dark hair . At one time he 'd been an athlete , and even now he routinely jogged and kept in shape . Rosie had loved the firmness of his muscles as she stroked his back during lovemaking . Of course , it 'd been months since they 'd slept in the same bed , and much longer since they 'd actually made love . Rosie did n't even remember the last time . Had she known , she might have appreciated it more , lingered a moment longer at her husband 's side , savored the feel of his arms around her . One thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day he 'd hired Janice Lamond as his personal assistant . The thought of him entwined with Janice nearly suffocated Rosie and she forcefully shoved the image from her mind . Anger and revulsion at her husband 's - no , ex-husband 's - unfaithfulness rose like bile in the back of her throat . Zach 's raised voice caught her attention ; apparently he 'd agreed to have their attorneys negotiate this added complication to their divorce decree . Otto was checking with the clerk for an empty conference room . Once a private room in the law library was secured , Zach and his attorney sat at one side of the table , across from Rosie and hers . Even the attorneys seemed perplexed by the situation . " I ca n't say I 've ever heard of such a decree before , " Sharon said , starting the conversation . " Me , neither . " Otto frowned . " This is one for the books . " " Fine , " Zach said in a curt voice , " it 's unusual , but we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I was sincere about putting the children first . " He glared at Rosie , as if to suggest she had n't been . " If you were sincere , you would 've had second thoughts about sleeping with that slut . " Rosie had n't intended to be argumentative , but if her ex-husband was so concerned about their children 's welfare , he would never have broken his wedding vows . " I refuse to dignify that remark by responding to it , " Zach said through gritted teeth . " Besides if you were home more , instead of volunteering for every cause known to mankind , every cause except your children , you 'd - " " Well , I refuse to allow you to blame me for what you 've done . " Her volunteer efforts were Zach 's big complaint . He had his wish ; she 'd had to resign from every position she held and seek paid employment . She hoped he was happy . For the first time since their children were born , Rosie was n't a stay-at-home mom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree ? " Zach asked with a bored look , an expression that was obviously for her benefit . " If we 're going to trade insults I 'd rather not pay our attorneys to listen . " ( Continues ... ) by Debbie Macomber
