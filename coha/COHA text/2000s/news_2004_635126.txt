<p> t 's hard to know how to start an interview with Carol Moseley Braun . There 's really only one question  --  " What were you thinking ? " But it seems rude just to lead off with that . <p> So , because I am a coward  --  instinctively , frustratingly reverent in the presence of someone who , as the first African-American woman in the Senate , managed both to make history and , with a series of missteps and ethically dicey moves , quite possibly screw things up for those who might follow in her trailblazing footsteps  --  I begin by asking what she feels like talking about . <p> " Let 's talk about now , " she says , flashing her trademark smile . " I like to be in the present . " <p> Strange as it might seem , now is a great time to be Carol Moseley Braun . She abandoned a presidential campaign that never came close to getting off the ground , endorsing Howard Dean , then the apparent front-runner , rather than her friend and former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kerry emerge as the presumptive nominee . By electoral standards , her campaign was an utter failure . But the usual standards have never really applied to Carol Moseley Braun . <p> She sits here at the Calypso Cafe , a Hyde Park Caribbean restaurant that is one of her neighborhood favorites , smiling that smile , greeting patrons with the grace of a comfortably retired chief executive . She seems not only immune to embarrassment , but utterly unfamiliar with the concept . Everyone here greets her like a heroine . And she receives their accolades with just the right blend of pride and humility . <p> The big news , on the sunny afternoon we 've gotten together , is U.S. Senate candidate ( and fellow Hyde Park resident ) Barack Obama 's resounding victory in the Democratic primary and his impressive lead in the polls for the general election . Comparisons to Braun , who was , during her term , the only African American serving in the Senate , seem inevitable . I ask if she 's been speaking with Obama . <p> " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , referring to her own term in the Senate . Mildly annoyed by my apparent thick-headedness , but not quite giving up on me entirely , she answers the question in the briefest possible way , making it clear she is indulging me . <p> " Yes , I have talked to state Sen. Obama , " she says . <p> Grasping that I have hit on another untouchable topic  --  the list already includes her apparently doomed-from-the-start presidential bid , the miscalculated endorsement , now transferred , of course , to Kerry and her single , scandal-prone term in the Senate  --  I move on to the interviewer 's safest territory : Enough about the current state of Illinois politics ; what 's going on with you right now ? <p> I am rewarded with another of those brilliant smiles . <p> " I 've been writing a lot , " she says . " And I 'm still fund-raising and closing down the presidential campaign . . . until all the bills are paid and the FEC Federal Election Commission goes away . I pride myself on never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of pride go , it 's an interesting one for Braun to claim . Though it 's true she has never had to pay an FEC fine , she has been investigated regarding personal expenses ( for herself and her former-fiance/campaign manager Kgosie Matthews ) seemingly paid with campaign money , has had to correct numerous campaign bookkeeping errors , returning thousands of dollars in contributions to her 1992 campaign made in excess of federal limits , and has been criticized for apparent ethical lapses like her 1996 visit with Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha ( for which she did n't first get the required State Department approval ) and improper use of Medicaid funds  --  which Braun later had to repay  --  paid to her late mother . In short , the finer points of financial ethics are not generally considered her strong suit . <p> She says she is working on building a law practice , one that she hopes will focus more on business law than on lobbying , " but I know people in high places all around the world , " she says , so some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not bragging , " she says . " That 's just the reality of it . " <p> As her black bean soup and fried plantains arrive , her cell phone  --  a combination phone/text-pager/PDA  --  rings , and she interrupts herself to answer it . She 's been trying to get in touch with her 26-year-old son , Matt , a North Sider who just started graduate classes in computer science at the University of Chicago and who , she says with a laugh , seems to be busier and more in demand than she is . <p> " Meet me over here , " she says , directing him to the restaurant . " I 'll feed you , and then I 've got a proposition for you , OK ? " <p> After she hangs up , she turns to me and says , " I hope you do n't mind I invited him to lunch . " <p> In fact , I 'm thrilled that she has , since getting a glimpse of Braun-as-mother seems a far more compelling option than continuing a conversation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The closest Braun gets to mentioning her rocky political history is quoting a remark from Washington pundit Eleanor Clift , who told her , " The rules are different for pioneers . " <p> It 's a theory worth thinking about , the idea that Braun 's conduct as a candidate and senator was constantly scrutinized because she was a woman and African-American . Maybe she did nothing wrong , or nothing so different from what her white male colleagues were doing . Maybe she was held to a higher standard . <p> As we talk about this  --  carefully avoiding the substance of what she was actually accused of doing  --  she almost wins me over . I 'm getting a glimpse of Braun-as-candidate , courting me , finding something I connect with , then carefully developing our agreement . She is a mesmerizing speaker , confident without being intimidating and articulate without being condescending . She appeals to the idealist and the feminist in me , the same part that holds her  --  despite her troubled term in the Senate  --  as a heroine . <p> I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'm struck by how much this conversation has come to mirror her presidential campaign , which seemed to be more about rehabilitating her image and establishing her as an important figure than actually winning any primary contests . As she speaks , she is no longer a failed senator or a former ambassador to a strategically insignificant part of the world ( Braun served as U.S. ambassador to New Zealand during the Clinton administration ) , but a stateswoman and thinker , someone worth listening to . <p> And then she loses me . <p> " I 'm looking forward to the time when a mediocre woman can run for office , " she says . " Because certainly mediocre is fine for men . " <p> I get the point  --  it seems unlikely that a woman with the political credentials of , say , George W. Bush , the 11/2-term governor of a state where the governor does n't have a lot of power , would be elected president  --  but hate the message . Should the lowest common denominator really be what we 're going for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter  --  What standards should we have for the people we elect to high office ?  --  Matt arrives , and Braun is transformed once again . <p> " Get whatever you want , " she tells him , handing him a menu . He 's ridden his bike here and , after all that exercise , " needs to eat . " <p> Their interest in one another is beyond the usual mother-son patter . They seem like genuine friends . She wants him to help her unpack some boxes  --  Braun moved in to a new home months ago , but has n't had a chance to get settled  --  and he plays at dreading the work , but happily obliges her . <p> And then , apologizing for interrupting our interview , he promises not to say another word . <p> " Oh , no , " she tells him , " we were practically done . " <p> And then she looks across at me , smiles and adds , " Were n't we ? "
