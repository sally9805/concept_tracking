THERE ARE PHOTOGRAPHERS . There are strobing flashes . They know ahead of time there will be . They leave their rented limo and walk across the Boston Common toward the State House hand in hand , heads held high . They 're in love , and they want to tell the world about it . <p> W is tall , in a conservative - compassionate , oh yes , but conservative - gray suit with television-blue shirt and maroon necktie . O is taller , and his turban lends him a few extra inches besides . His shalwar kamiz is of all-natural fabrics . He 's trimmed his beard for the occasion - just a little , but you can tell . <p> " How did you meet ? " a reporter calls to the two of them . <p> They both smile . O 's eyes twinkle . If that 's not mascara , he has the longest eyelashes in the world . Their hands squeeze - Ws right , O 's left . " Oh , we 've been chasing each other for years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It is so . Inshallah , we shall be together forever , " O says . " Truly God is great , to let us find such happiness . " <p> News vans clog Beacon Street . Cops need to clear a path through the reporters so W and O can cross . A TV guy looking for an angle asks one of Boston 's finest , " What do you think of all this ? " <p> " Me ? " The policeman shrugs . " I do n't see how it 's my business one way or the other . The court says they 've got the right to do it , so that 's what the law is . Long as they stay inside the law , nothing else matters . " <p> " Uh , thank you . " The TV guy sounds disappointed . He wants controversy , fireworks . That 's what TV news is all about . Acceptance ? One word - boring . <p> The State House . Good visuals . Gilded dome . Corinthian colonnade . The happy couple going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . More camerapersons , too . O raises a hand against the bright television lights . More flashes go off , one after another . " Boy , you 'd think we 're in the middle of a nucular war or something , " W says . He always pronounces it nuculai . <p> " Nuclear , " O says gently . " It 's nuclear . " You can tell he 's been trying to get W to do it right for a long time . Every couple needs a little something to squabble about . It takes the strain off , it really does . <p> " Can we get a picture of you two in front of the Sacred Cod ? " a photographer asks . <p> " I do n't mind . " W is as genial as they come . <p> But O frowns . " Sacred Cod ? It sounds like a graven image . No , I think not . " He shakes his head . " It would not play well in Riyadh or Kandahar . " <p> " Aw , c'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a nickname for everybody , even his nearest and dearest . And he really does like to oblige . <p> But O digs in his heels . " I do not care to do this . It is not why we came here . I know why we came here . " He bends down and whispers in Ws ear . W laughs - giggles , almost . Of course , maybe O 's beard tickles , trimmed or not . <p> W gives the reporters kind of a sheepish smile . " Sorry , friends . That 's one photo op you 're not gon na get . Now which way to the judge 's office ? " <p> " Chambers . The judge 's chambers , " O says . You wonder which one was brought up speaking English . <p> " Whatever . " W does n't care how he talks . " Which way ? " There 's a big old sign with an arrow - implies - showing the way . He does n't notice till one of the reporters points to it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls after them : " What do you see in each other ? " <p> They stop . They turn so they 're face to face . They gaze into each other 's eyes . Now they have both hands clasped together . Anyone can tell it 's love . " We need each other , " W says . Even if he does n't talk real well , he gets the message across . <p> " My infidel , " O says fondly . <p> " My little terrorist . " W 's eyes glow . <p> You 've seen couples who say the same thing at the same time ? They do it here . " Without him , " they both say , each pointing to the other , " I 'm nothing . " O strokes W 's cheek . W swats O on the butt . They 're grinning when they go into the judge 's chambers . <p> The justice of the peace looks at the two of them over the top of her glasses . How many times has she done that , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't stop you . But I do want to ask you if you 're sure about what you 're doing , " she says . " Marriage is a big step . You should n't enter into it lightly . " <p> " We 're sure , ma'am , " W says . <p> " Oh , yes , " O says . " Oh , yes . " <p> " Well , you sound like you mean it . That 's good , " she says . " You 're making a commitment to each other for the rest of your lives . You 're promising to be there for each other in sickness and in health , in good times and in bad . " <p> " We understand , " O says . <p> " I should say we do . " W nods like a bobblehead , up and down , up and down . " We already look out for each other . Why , if it was n't for Sam here , my poll numbers would be underwater . " <p> O beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate , and W makes hating them so easy . Take Abu Ghraib , for instance . You 'd think he did it just for me . " <p> " Nope . Was n't like that at all . " Now W 's head goes side to side , side to side , as if it 's on a spring . " We both had fun there . We share lots of things . " He grins at O. " see ? I told you I 'd bring you to justice . " <p> O laughs . " All right . " <p> The corners of the justice of the peace 's mouth twitch up in spite of themselves . She does n't meet devotion like this every day . " Let 's proceed to the ceremony , then . " She reads the carefully nondenominational words . At last , she gets to the nitty-gritty . " Do you take each other to have and to hold , to love and to cherish , as long as you both shall live ? " <p> " I do . " W @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the authority vested in me by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , I now pronounce you man and , uh , man . " Even though they 're legal , the judge is still new at same-sex marriages . Who is n't ? But she recovers well : " You may kiss each other . " <p> They do . In here , it 's nothing but a little peck on the lips . They wink at each other . They know what the cameras outside are waiting for . <p> AN EXPLOSION , a fusillade of flashes when they come out into the hallway . You can see W 's mouth shaping nuculai again , but you ca n't hear him - too many people yelling questions at once . You can see O tolerantly nodding , too . He knows Ws ' not about to change . <p> A guy with a great big voice makes himself heard through the din : " Is it official ? " <p> " It sure is , " W says . <p> " Have you kissed each other yet ? " somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah , " W answers . The reporters make disappointed noises . W and O wink at each other again . Sometimes they 're like a couple of little kids - they seem to think they 've invented what they share . " We could do it again , if you want us to , " W says . <p> The roar of approval startles even him and O. O grabs him , bends him back movie-style , and plants a big kiss right on his mouth . Ws arms tighten around O 's neck . The kiss goes on and on . Another zillion flashes freeze it in thin slices so the whole world can see . <p> Everything has to end . At last , the kiss does . " Wow ! " a reporter says . " Is that hotter than Madonna and Britney or what ? " <p> " Than who ? " O does n't get out much . <p> W does . " You betcha , " he says . If his grin gets any wider , the top of his head will fall off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Sure looks like one . <p> " Where will you honeymoon ? " another reporter calls . <p> " In the mountains , " O says . <p> " At the ranch , " W says at the same time . <p> Not quite in synch there . They look at each other . They pantomime comic shrugs . They 'll work it out . <p> Still hand in hand , they leave the State House . " Massachusetts is a very nice place , " O says . " Very ... tolerant . " <p> " Well , if they put up with me here , they 'll put up with anybody , " W says , and gets a laugh . <p> " Got ta take you to meet the folks , " W says as they start back toward the limo . <p> O raises an eyebrow . " That should be ... interesting . " <p> " Well , yeah . " W sounds kind of sheepish . His folks are very , very straight . Then out of nowhere he grins all over his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that waddayacallit I showed you . " He snaps his fingers . " La Cage aux Folles , that 's it . " You think W has trouble with English , you should hear him try French . Or maybe you should n't . It 's pretty bad . <p> " You are joking ? " There 's an ominous ring in O 's voice . <p> " No , no ! " W 's practically jumping up and down . He 's got it all figured out . He may not be right , but by God , he 's sure . " We 'll put you in a bertha , that 's what we 'll do ! " <p> " A what ? " O says . <p> " Come on , Sam . You know . You ought to . You 've seen ' em close up , right ? One of those robe things that does n't show anything but your eyes . " <p> " A burka ? " <p> " That 's what I said , is n't it ? " W thinks it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " O says in icy tones . Then he smiles thinly - very thinly . " Oh , I see . " He draws himself up to his full height , straight as a rocket-propelled grenade launcher . A cat could n't show more affronted dignity , or even as much . " No . " <p> And W laughs fit to bust . He howls . He slaps his knee . " Gotcha ! I gotcha , Sam ! Ca n't tell me I did n't , not this time . I had you going good . " He pokes O in the ribs with a pointy elbow . <p> " You were joking ? " O looks at him . " You were joking , " he admits . He laughs , too , ruefully . " Yes , you got me . This time you got me . " <p> W gives him a hug . You ca n't stay mad at W , no matter how much you want to . He just wo n't let you . " I 'm glad I 've got you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melts . He ca n't help it . " I 'm glad I 've got you , too - you troublemaker , " he says . They both laugh . O goes on , " But maybe we could meet your parents another time ? " <p> " After the honeymoon ? " W says . <p> " Wherever it is , " O says . <p> " I love you , " says W. " You made me what I am today . " <p> " And you me . " O kisses W , and they walk off across the Common with their arms around each other 's waists . <p> Sidebar
