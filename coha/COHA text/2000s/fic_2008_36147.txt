Swim to the Middle <br> 1980 <br> I avoid reunions . I 'm not a rebel , a recluse , or a sociopath , and I 'm too young to qualify as a crank , even if it 's true that I just spent the evening of my twenty-fifth birthday not carousing with friends or drinking champagne at a candlelit table for two but resolutely alone and working , glazing a large ovoid porcelain bowl while listening to Ella Fitzgerald sing songs by the Gershwin brothers . ( A crank could never love Gershwin . ) My one real boyfriend in college , just before we broke up , told me I 'm nostalgic to a fault . He professed contempt for what he called " the delusional sound track to our parents ' deluded lives . " He informed me that you ca n't be nostalgic for things that had their heyday before you were so much as born . Just about any member of my family would have laughed him out the door and down the garden path . <br> Family reunions are the worst  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the hardest to avoid . But when my father 's Great-Aunt Lucy died last summer , there was an inheritance at stake , a collection of antique jewelry . Not the glossy priceless stuff  --  no diamonds , tiaras , or niagaras of pearls . Not things you 'd sell but things so deliciously old-fashioned and stylish that to wear them makes you feel like a character from a Jane Austen novel or a Chekhov play . The one piece I remembered most vividly was a cameo , two inches square , ivory on steel-blue Pacific coral , a woman 's face inclined toward her hand , in her slender fingers an iris . Aunt Lucy had worn that cameo day and night , winter and summer , on lace and wool . Maybe she 'd left us a charm bracelet , maybe earrings of garnet or Mexican silver , but mostly I wondered about that cameo . And wanted it . I 'd wanted it since I was a little girl . One of my earliest memories is of sitting on Lucy 's lap , squirming to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her kind honeyed voice in my hair as she talked with the other grown-ups gathered on her porch . She did not object to my poking and fingering the cameo , probing its fragile details : the woman 's eyelids and earlobes , the cuticles of her nails , the harmoniously wandering tendrils of her hair . She let me borrow it once , for a family dinner at a country inn . <br> Because Lucy never had children , not even a husband , my father long ago became the one who kept an eye on her in the last decades of her very long life . Geographically , he was the closest family member by far ; out of a large , tenaciously Confederate clan , they were the only two living anywhere you can count on snow . Once Dad decided to stay north , after earning two degrees at Harvard , the family lumped him together with Lucy : " How are the defectas faring up yonda ? " a cousin might ask Dad at a wedding in Memphis or Charleston . Happily , their proximity blossomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lucy 's will , which emerged from her bureau drawer along with a letter to my father that she 'd written a year before she died . It began , To my splendid grandnephew Beauchance : Before I take my irreversible leave ( which I suppose I will now have taken , strange to think ) , I am seizing this lucid moment to write down a few matters pertaining to the house and my ragbag possessions therein . I have little doubt that I shall have left the house in a rather sorry state , for which I apologize . Be charitable , if you can , to any bats or raccoons which may have colonized the attic or basement ( though none to my knowledge have done so ) , and please take Sonny 's word on any tasks for which he claims I still owe him payment ; our mutual accounting has grown slack if not capricious . . . . <br> Over the phone , Dad read me the letter in its crisp yet meandering entirety , stopping now and then to chuckle . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wrote , Whatever modest adornments pass for jewelry , I leave to your daughters , Louisa and Clement . I did not become as intimately acquainted with them as I would have liked , but I did know the satisfaction , one summer to the next , of seeing how they grew ; as I wish I had seen you evolve in your youth . I wish I had known much sooner , Beau , that you would become the facsimile of a perfect son , a gift whose pleasures I wish I had been blessed to know firsthand . <br> His voice cracked on the word gift , as if he did n't deserve such gratitude , my father who will do just about anything for anyone , driving my mother crazy with all the favors he does for everyone else ( including , as she likes to say , any random citizen of Outer Slobovia and its most godforsaken suburbs ) . <br> I decided to fly across the entire country because I could n't bear the thought that if I did n't show up in person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by default . On the plane , I tried to decide which of two equally vulgar motives , materialism or spite , had compelled me to buy a ticket I could n't afford to a place where I 'd see no one I wanted to see . My life was not , as people like to say , in a good place  --  though , ironically , the place where I lived at the time happened to be Santa Barbara . So I made excuses and timed my visit to avoid the masses of cousins , aunts , and uncles who would descend on Lucy 's house to grope the heirlooms by day and drink too much bourbon by night . I may share their Huguenot blood , but not their bad taste in booze and their glutinous drawl . I will never forget how , when our grandmother died two years ago , the family marauded her New Orleans house with no more respect than the Union soldiers who stripped us all bare a century back . You 'd think , with all our costly educations , the reconstructed Jardines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an ugly brawl , which featured weeping and a smashed lamp , over the Steinway grand . Someone with Solomonic intentions actually went so far as to crank up a chainsaw . I could not deal with that type of gathering all over again . Whether I could deal with Clem remained to be seen . <br> My sister had been living with Aunt Lucy for what proved to be her final summer . After Lucy 's death , Clem stayed on while the relatives passed through , finishing up her summer jobs before heading back to college for her junior year . During the days , Clem worked in a bike shop and volunteered at a sanctuary for recovering raptors : birds , she 'd explained when I called , that had been shot , struck by small planes , tortured by teenage boys . In the evenings , she kept an eye on Lucy  --  until her sudden death at the beginning of August . Not that our aunt was infirm , incontinent , or witless , but for the last several months of her life she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark on urgent eccentric missions . Winooski , Vermont , is a snug , friendly place , so she was n't likely to be mugged or abducted . Nevertheless , reasoned Dad , who could say she would n't do something drastic like sell her last shares of Monsanto and Kodak , head for the airport , and unintentionally vanish ? <br> I 'd hardly spoken to Clem since moving out west two years before . After college , in pursuit of a man I 'd prefer to jettison from memory , I hauled my pottery wheel , my heart , and my disastrously poor judgment from Providence to California . It was completely unlike me to do anything so rash ; maybe , subconsciously , I was trying to get back at Clem by pretending to be Clem , to annoy her by stealing her role as devil-may-care adventuress . Whatever the reason for my tempestuous act , it backfired . Three weeks after I signed a lease and bought a secondhand kiln , the boyfriend shed me like a stifling , scratchy-collared coat . To keep up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I gave up my car . After that , I sold a pitcher here , a platter there , but to stave off eviction I wrote articles for a magazine that told workaholic doctors what to do with their leisure time . In college , I 'd been just as good with words as I was with clay , and one of my Brit-lit classmates had started this odd publication . People had laughed , but subscriptions to Doc 's Holiday sold like deodorant soap . <br> Thus did I hold starvation at bay , but I also felt like the work kept me stuck in a place where I ought to love living but did n't . Everything out there unnerved me : the punk shadows of palm trees slashing the lawns , the sun setting  --  not rising  --  over the ocean , the solitude of the sidewalks as I rushed everywhere on foot , carless and stared at . My inner compass refused to budge . North ! it kept urging me . East ! I 'd just come to the conclusion that I did n't belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my work , both kinds , but I had no intention of letting Clem in on my angst . My plan was never to trust her again , never to fall for her charms the way everyone else , especially men , seemed to do so fervently . And to snare that cameo . Maybe a string of pearls . Oh , Glenn Miller . I love him , too . What 's life without a little delusion ? <br> <br> If you 're to hear Louisa 's version of what went on last summer , you will also be hearing mine . Louisa 's worst side is the one I call the Judge . + la Salem witchcraft trials . There 's this look she gets on her face that tells the world and everyone in it how completely unworthy it and they are to contain or witness her presence . Beware ! says that look . The Spanish Inquisition was Entenmann 's Danish ! <br> Her new life in Santa Ladeedabra did not seem to have mellowed her out one iota , because when I pulled up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firm as a church hat , beaming her world-weary scorn clear across the state of Vermont . I was late , okay , which did n't help . It did n't help either , I know , that it was me picking her up . <br> I wonder sometimes what kind of sisters we 'll be when we 're ancient ( if we ever are ) . Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine : before that visit , you 'd have bet the hacienda we 'd end up like them . Cold ? Suspicious ? Resentful ? Ever notice how sisters , when they are n't best friends , make particularly vicious enemies ? Like , they could be enemies from the time they lay their beady little eyes on each other , maybe because their mother makes them rivals or maybe because there 's not enough love to go around and  --  not out of greed but from the gut , like two hawks zeroing in on a wren  --  they have no choice but to race for it . ( Laws of nature , pure and simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Share ? Oh please . Whatever it is that feeds the hunger , dive-bomb first , philosophize later . ) Or maybe they grow apart in a more conscious way , maybe because their marriages clash : the guys they choose see each other as losers or sellouts ; the women are helplessly loyal . But that 's not our story . No husbands yet , not even a hint of husband . <br> I 've always been the favorite  --  our mother 's , at least . Partly , it 's the animal thing : Mom grew up on a storybook farm where animals ruled life more strictly than clocks . And I happen to be the one who set my sights that way . Saving animals is all I 've ever wanted to do . In fourth grade , I asked Mom to give me all her shoe boxes . A hospital : that was the plan . I cut windows in the ends of the boxes and stacked them in the bottom of my closet like high-rise condos . My first baby bird got the penthouse . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd learn . But that did n't stop me . " You 're my daughter , all right , " said Mom when she saw what I 'd built ( though her tone made me wonder if the likeness was such a good thing ) . <br> Louisa thinks this makes my life easy  --  being the favorite . She does n't realize that once you 're the disappointment , or once you 've chosen a path seen as odd or unchoosable , your struggle is over , right ? On the other side of the fence  --  mine  --  every expectation you fulfill ( or look like you might , on purpose or not ) puts you one step higher and closer to that Grand Canyon rim from which you could one day rule the world  --  or plummet in very grand style . <br> <br> In the car , I let Clem do the talking . She was late to pick me up , and I was glad : it gave me a reason to sulk until I could get my bearings . I was glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fatigue . I can not sleep on planes . So Clem filled me in on the reading of the will and what she called the Great Divide : relatives clutching lists , drawing lots , swarming the house like fire ants . But this time there were no dogfights ; everyone , said Clem , remembered the piano brawl . <br> I had n't seen the place in five years , and when we arrived , I just stood on the walk and stared . It 's a Victorian , more aspiring than grand , and it had always looked a little anemic , but now it was a wreck . The sallow paint , formerly white , hung off the clapboards in broad curling tongues , and the blue porch ceiling bore the crusty look of a cave complete with stalactites . The flagstones were fringed with moss . The front steps sagged . That the lawn had just been mowed made the house look even more derelict . " How could Dad let her live this way ? " I asked . <br> Continues ...    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
