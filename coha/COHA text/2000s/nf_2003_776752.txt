The mountains and high plains of extreme northeastern Oregon are so far from well-traveled freeways that even most Oregonians have never been to this wilderness area where the sky seems close enough to touch . These are the " Oregon Alps . " Serious outdoorsmen and those with family ties to Wallowa County follow the thin red lines on the map that promise at most only " paved highways , " up and up through the mountains from Pendleton or La Grande . The summits are more than five thousand feet high , and then the roads descend through tiny villages whose buildings are mostly gray shadows of their former incarnations , tumbled with old-fashioned perennials and weeds , fading storefronts and little churches with peeling paint : Adams , Athena , Elgin , Minam , Wallowa , Lostine . Near the end of the road is Enterprise - the county seat - and finally the hamlet called Joseph , named for the great chief of the Nez Perc ? tribe . All these towns , so far-flung from city lives , have a presence and a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without urgency . // Enterprise and Joseph blossom in the summer as tourists who have discovered Wallowa County arrive . Sheltered between the Wallowa Mountains to the west and the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area to the east , Enterprise , population 1,900 , is a wonderful place to live , but only if one is self-employed , working for the county or the city , or serving the needs of the residents . It is too distant from the larger Oregon cities along the coast or in the center of the state to make commuting feasible . The only industry of any sort is up the road eight miles , in Joseph . Perched on the shore of Wallowa Lake , Joseph has embraced sculpture and bronze foundries as a very successful economic lifeline ; every street corner has a statue that seems to burst with life frozen in mid-movement - maidens and cowboys and eagles in flight - each statue large enough to require a truck to pack it out . // In the summer , Wallowa Lake is a burning hollow in the mountains , with its azure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is cold , but not cold enough to deter boaters and water-skiers , who seem somehow out of place on the waters where Native Americans once fished . The mountains and the soaring trees have always been there and will always be there ; the humans playing on the lake seem , in contrast , quite temporary . // Deer wander at will in Joseph , strolling along the narrow roads , peering into windows , and mingling with tourists at food stands and riding stables . A lift carries tourists who are n't afraid of heights far up the Wallowa Range . Flowers of every variety burst forth in the short summer season , boldly defiant against winter for their precious few months in the sun . // The center of Wallowa County government is in Enterprise , where a courthouse built in 1909 sits in the center of parklike grounds . Ninety-four years ' worth of feet have worn away the interior stairways as generations of citizens went about their business with public records and the laws of Wallowa County . Bright greenswards and paths crisscross the courthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweet alyssum make it resemble a set for The Music Man . There are concerts in the bandstand on the courthouse lawn , and the melodies floating on a summer 's night are nostalgic enough to sting the eye with tears . // In 2000 , Dan Ousley was the district attorney of Wallowa County . He was a familiar presence before judges and juries in the courthouse in Enterprise . But he was well into his second term in office before he ever had to deal with a murder that was n't an open-and-shut case . And when he did have to prosecute a baffling homicide , it was a case that would have challenged prosecutors in Portland or Seattle or San Francisco , a crime that defied all reason , one that could be viewed straight on or through a microscope , and even then failed to reveal all its incredible variables . // Was the victim ultimately answerable for the bloody crime ? Or was the accused capable of a meticulously choreographed execution ? And perhaps even more important , who was the person who had held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers , and no way of telling if the personality shown to the world was truly the one almost everyone had perceived . Or was it all a clever masquerade , hiding evil ? // * * * // It is n't easy to get to the camping sites on the Lostine River near the Maxwell Campgrounds trailhead that leads mountain hikers into the Eagle Cap Wilderness . To reach the campgrounds , one has to turn off Route 82 and head south from the town of Lostine . The first six or seven miles are partially paved , but that soon gives way to a gravel road . Even a four-wheel drive vehicle skitters along the washboard road that carves a path through the trees , the road so high-centered that it is a challenge for even the most competent drivers . It is n't a Sunday sight-seeing drive ; one misjudged stomp on the brakes and a car or truck can slide and roll over and over . // Twelve miles or so from Lostine , fir forests cluster thickly along the road . On the right , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late United States Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas when he craved the solace of deep wilderness . They are spartan and overgrown now with brush . On the same side of the road , there is a forest ranger station - usually the last outpost where a phone of any kind will work . Beyond that , the Wallowas rise up and up , shutting off radio and cell phone transmission . In this tunnel of trees , it is impossible not to think of the danger of forest fires and wonder how quickly this road could be closed off by flames . // Almost twenty miles in , just before the trailhead , thin rutted paths begin to appear , wide enough apart for tires to traverse . They lead to campgrounds , maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service , that are situated so each camping party has privacy . Much sought after in the warm months , the riverside campgrounds are empty in winter , buried beneath snowdrifts , next to a river as cold and clear as ice . // On a weekday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiking had gone back to civilization . More so than in many other places , October brought the empty sense that comes with a season 's ending . It would be only a matter of weeks before the road in - or out - would be choked with snow . // If anyone was camping in early October , their vehicles parked close to the river campsites were nearly invisible from the road . Campers could drive at least seventy-five feet off the main road before they reached the horizontal tree trunk barriers that delineated parking spots . Trees and shadows hid their rigs , and from there , they had only to walk down an easy slope to the sandy shores of the Lostine River . // The Lostine itself is narrow , not more than forty feet or so across , shallow and crystalline with little ladders of rapids frothed with white . It is an icy cold river , stemming from alpine lakes high in the mountains . A storm runoff from the mountains has occasionally turned the Lostine dangerous , but in October it is usually a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the most , surrounded by sentry rows of fir trees standing perfectly straight , their feathered tops piercing the sky hundreds of feet above . // * * * // It was early Monday afternoon , October 9 , 2000 , and the Shady Campground - one of the closest to the trailhead - appeared to be unoccupied . There were no sounds at all , save for the wind high in the trees and the occasional cry of a bird . For the moment , it was totally silent in the deserted camping area next to the winding Lostine River . // Rich Stein was the undersheriff of Wallowa County . He had been involved in law enforcement for eighteen years , and he had worked in the Wallowa County Sheriff 's Office for fourteen and a half of those years . He was hoping to become sheriff the next month through a flourishing write-in campaign . Sheriff Ron Jett did n't plan to run again . // Stein halfway believed that he was on a wild-goose chase as he drove slowly along the gravel road close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for , a lost camper or someone who was injured . Sheriff Jett had sent him up to the campgrounds after Jett received a couple of phone calls from outside the county . // " I want you to go on up to the trailhead - maybe check things out along the river , see if anybody is there , " Jett had said . " I 'm not sure what you might find .... " // Stein was n't really familiar with the campgrounds . His primary job was to oversee the deputies and run the patrol , but in Wallowa County , even the undersheriff had to pull shifts and work patrol . Sheriff Jett had told him to check out all of the overnight campgrounds . Stein thought there were about a dozen of them nestled down by the river . The one he thought was the last campsite was the Williamson Campground , and he drove in , parked , and walked down to the sandy beach but found no one there . // Stein estimated that the area he was searching was about eighteen miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone on his sheriff 's radio , so he drove back along the forest road until he came to a high spot where his radio worked . He thought that maybe if he could get a little better idea of what he was looking for , he could be more effective . He called the Sheriff 's Office , and Jett said that the latest information indicated that it was probably the Shady Campground he should check out . " It 's the last one down the line . " // This time , Jett 's voice was more serious . It was possible that Stein was looking for a person who was critically wounded . He passed a campground and saw a lone car parked there . He checked that and found nobody in or near it . Now he could see there was another campsite . He glanced toward the sign marking it as SHADY CAMPGROUND and saw a newer model white Chevy Suburban parked against the log barrier . // Stein pulled his pickup close to that vehicle . Like a lot of cops who have ridden patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he winced a little as he eased out of his truck and crossed the uneven ground to look into the Suburban . He could see that the locks were pushed down . Inside , there was camping gear and other items , the usual stuff that people brought up to the wilderness - but there was no sign of a driver . // The Forest Service 's picnic table just beyond the Suburban had camping equipment on it , too . It looked as though a family had enjoyed a picnic . " I walked over there and called out - announcing that I was a deputy sheriff , " Stein recalled . " And I was shouting , ' Is there anyone around ? ' But there was no response . " // There was a tent pitched nearby , but there was no movement inside , and no answer to his calls . // Two trails led down to the river , one shorter and steeper than the other , although neither demanded that a hiker be in good condition . Stein took the shorter trail that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple explanation for his feeling of dread , he acknowledged the eerie sensation . He shook it off ; the people who had come here in the Suburban were probably just taking a short hike from the trailhead . An empty vehicle was n't unusual . // And then he glanced to the south and caught a glimpse of bright blue fabric spread out down by the river . It was a sleeping bag . // " I yelled again , " Stein recalled . " No response . " // Gingerly , Stein walked down toward the river , his boots sinking and skidding a little in the sand . // The sun was high in the sky and it cut through the mist in the treetops , casting a glow over the sleeping bag . It was bright enough to awaken even the heaviest sleeper . The mummy-style bag lay at right angles to the river , with the " head " part almost touching a log the Forest Service had placed there just where the sandy beach began . The shallow edges of the Lostine lapped softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Stein called out again , more softly now , " Anybody here ? Sheriff 's office ... " // Nobody answered . As he got closer , Stein could tell that there was somebody in the sleeping bag . " I approached it very cautiously , " he said . He was n't afraid . And it was n't as if he had n't investigated reports of a possible body before ; it was more that this was one of the loneliest places he had ever been . // The form zipped into the sleeping bag was as motionless as the scattered boulders on the shore . Stein saw tufts of hair just above the one ear that showed . Either it was reddish blond naturally or something had stained it pale mahogany . He thought it was probably blood or some other dark liquid , although the sleeping bag was n't stained as far as Stein could see . // At this altitude , in October even the glaring sun would n't warm the air in the shadows enough to make a sleeper perspire and peel down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no longer able to unzip the sleeping bag and crawl out . Maybe the person had fallen and sustained a head injury . Or maybe someone had struck the still form on the head while the camper was sleeping - or passed out . // Had someone abandoned the sleeper and the camp in the scenic wilderness deliberately ? Or had the camper come alone to this small cleared area high in the mountains to get away from the problems of the world , possibly never intending to go back ? Was it an accident - or a homicide ? It was so isolated in the Shady Campground that it would have been a long time before hunters chanced on the scene and discovered whatever had happened here . And if a sudden early blizzard came - as it often did in Wallowa County - it might have been spring before anyone came in. // Except for the blond hair stiff with blood , and a folding chair tilted at an odd angle in the river , the campsite had an almost benign air . // Stein slipped his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd discovered only a drunk sleeping it off . He touched skin and found it cold as marble . He pressed against the flesh just below the ear , searching for the reassuring beat of blood pulsing through the carotid artery . // But there was none . // Stein chose the gently sloping trail back to the picnic area and returned to his pickup truck . He could n't take the steep route back because he did n't want to walk through the death scene again . It was only when he slid into the driver 's seat that he realized he did n't know if it was a man or a woman who lay dead in the sleeping bag . //
