<p> The death of Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler appears to be linked to a widely available and commonly used weight-loss supplement that is loosely regulated , a medical examiner said Tuesday . <p> The finding rekindled concerns over the safety of ephedra and calls for tighter control of the popular diet supplement by federal regulators . <p> Bechler , 23 , had been taking Xenadrine , an over-the-counter dietary supplement containing the stimulant ephedra , and it probably contributed to his death , said Dr. Joshua Perper , the Broward County , Fla. , medical examiner . <p> Ephedra has been associated with heart attacks , seizures and strokes and has been linked to dozens of deaths . <p> Ephedra , also known as ma huang , is widely used to lose weight or boost energy . It can be purchased for a few dollars under popular brand names such as Metabolife and generates more than $1 billion in sales annually . <p> Ephedra has been banned by many sports leagues  --  but not Major League Baseball . It is not closely regulated by the U.S. Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A growing number of medical experts and lawmakers want to change that . Some want the substance banned , while others want it tightly regulated . <p> " I think sooner or later Congress has to revisit some of these laws , and I think sports organizations have to go the extra mile and protect these athletes , " said Dr. Gary I. Wadler , a professor at New York University School of Medicine who advises the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy on drug use by athletes . <p> Bechler died Monday morning , less than 24 hours after collapsing during spring training in Fort Lauderdale , Fla . An autopsy found he had died from complications of heatstroke that caused many of his organs to fail , Perper said . <p> 108-DEGREE TEMPERATURE <p> His body temperature was 108 degrees , about 10 degrees above normal . <p> High blood pressure and liver abnormalities also contributed to Bechler 's death , Perper said . A bottle of Xenadrine was found in his locker , officials said . <p> Toxicology test results wo n't be available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was believed to have taken three Xenadrine tablets before his Sunday workout . There was no trace of solid food in Bechler 's digestive tract , Perper said , suggesting he had been following a strict diet . <p> The lack of food , combined with the stimulants and the relatively warm weather  --  80 degrees  --  when he collapsed probably led to his death , Perper said . <p> " At this time , I do n't have a complete or sufficient degree of toxicology results that I can say precisely what was in the blood and at what levels , " Perper said . " But it 's very difficult to believe in view of all the circumstances that anything else was really of importance . " <p> COMPANY STATEMENT <p> Xenadrine is made by Cytodyne Technologies , a New Jersey manufacturer of weight-loss and fitness supplements . The company issued a statement Tuesday night standing by the safety and effectiveness of Xenadrine . <p> " Due to the lack of medical evidence available at this time , Cytodyne is unable to specifically comment on the circumstances surrounding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Until the toxicology report becomes available , it is sheer speculation as to whether Mr. Bechler ever used Xenadrine , or whether Xenadrine played any role whatsoever in contributing to his death . " <p> Ephedra is an extract of the ma huang plant , and ephedrine is the key chemical in ephedra . Ephedrine is found in many over-the-counter decongestants and cold remedies and is regulated by the FDA because it is a drug . But because ephedra is a naturally occurring substance , it is considered a dietary supplement like vitamins and is not closely regulated . <p> Ephedra is popular with dieters because it increases energy while raising the body 's metabolism . Many athletes use the supplement to ward off fatigue so they can exercise longer and harder . <p> But ephedra constricts blood vessels , making it harder for the body to push hot blood to the skin 's surface where it can cool . In extreme cases  --  and particularly when taken with caffeine  --  the constriction can be so severe that the heat gets trapped , raising the body 's temperatures high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN 2000 <p> Dr. Neal Benowitz , a clinical pharmacologist and professor of medicine at UC San Francisco , was among the first to sound the alarm when he and his colleagues linked ephedra to a host of deaths and disabling conditions in 2000 . Heart attacks and strokes topped the list , but the researchers also reviewed cases consistent with heatstroke , he said . <p> Combine that with dehydration , excess weight and poor conditioning , Benowitz said , and the results can be disastrous , even for a young athlete like Bechler  --  who weighed 239 pounds and wanted to lose weight . <p> Further casting doubt on ephedra , a study released two weeks ago by researchers at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center found that while it accounts for less than 1 percent of all herbal supplement sales , it is responsible for 64 percent of all adverse health reactions to herbs . <p> The study concluded that people taking products with ephedra were 200 times more likely to suffer complications than people using other diet supplements . <p> Efforts by the FDA to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . <p> The Rand think tank , at the request of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , is currently studying the effectiveness of ephedra and whether it causes health problems . Results are expected within a few months . <p> SALE TO MINORS BANNED <p> California law bans the sale of ephedra products to minors . Gov . Gray Davis  --  who has collected more than $100,000 in campaign contributions from Metabolife International Inc. since becoming governor four years ago  --  vetoed a law two years ago that would have restricted ephedra sales . <p> He reversed his position in August when he signed the ban against sales to minors and called on the FDA to regulate ephedra . Rep. Susan Davis , D-San Diego , has been pushing state legislation to regulate it as well . <p> The National Football League , the National College Athletic Association and the International Olympic Committee have banned ephedra , but Major League Baseball has not prohibited it . <p> " We 're going to wait until we know more about what happened , " said baseball spokesman Rich Levin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cautioned players about the dangers of ephedra . The New York Yankees and San Francisco Giants reiterated those concerns with players on Tuesday . <p> " We really try to educate them , " said Stan Conte , Giants head trainer . " We liken supplements to spit tobacco . Spit tobacco is legal . Study after study has proven it causes cancer , but people still do it . We ca n't take it away , but we can educate them of the dangers .
