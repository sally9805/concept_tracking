<p> Had Joe Gibbs tried to get into the specifics of all that is broken , he would have needed a DVD player and three or four hours . So in the immediate aftermath of getting backhanded by the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday night , Gibbs stuck with a more general diagnosis when he said , " We 've got to find a way to fix a bunch of things . " <p> Well , they 've got one week to get it right . Next Sunday in Houston is it . <p> Do n't get me wrong , I hate dramatic discussions this early in the season because every year we see teams limp into the season , get hot after Halloween and bolt right into the playoffs . The Redskins , in fact , did it last season . <p> Still , a whole lot will be riding on a second trip to Texas , to Houston , because the annual trip to Dallas was a big bust . The Redskins collapsed . <p> The defense was bad , the offense was worse . The players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim blame because the Cowboys are nothing special . In fact , the Dallas Cowboys were there to be had late in the third quarter . <p> A turnover produced by Sean Taylor put the Redskins in Dallas territory . They were trailing only by a touchdown , 17-10 at the time . The Redskins were n't playing particularly well , but they were at least knocking heads . <p> You could hear and feel the crackle of the Redskins ' hits on Cowboys receivers and ball carriers who were starting to flinch and drop passes . A touchdown then would have tied it and even a field goal could have given the Redskins the lift they needed to put a reeling team on its backside . <p> But Mark Brunell lofted a pass that Roy Williams intercepted at the goal line . And instead of being tied or within four , the Redskins then let the Cowboys march 99 yards on just six plays to turn a tight game into a rout . <p> Since the Redskins ca n't beat anybody their own size just yet , maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week . They had better . Like the Texans , the Redskins are winless . Like the Texans , the Redskins ( surprisingly ) ca n't stop anybody when it counts , and certainly ca n't manufacture any offense . Like the Texans , the Redskins kill themselves with penalties and mistakes , small and large . As bad as 0-2 is , 0-3 is much worse . <p> Yes , it 's a long season , but it 's not a baseball season or a basketball season . The Redskins already are reduced to hoping they can avoid disaster and we have n't even reached autumn yet . " We have to go to work and somehow , some way figure out how we can win a football game and get ourselves " on track , Gibbs said . <p> It 's not like the Redskins stink . They 're not Oakland bad or Detroit bad . <p> They 're just not any good , not yet anyway . If you did n't know Al Saunders 's body of work over the last five years , you would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two weeks in , it 's just a bunch of dump-offs to the backs and quick screens . Brunell has n't thrown one of those rainbow deep balls in two weeks . You know how the Raiders ( well , at least the old Raiders ) like to play vertical football ? The Redskins and Cowboys are both playing horizontal football . Nobody goes down the field despite having cheetahs lined up wide . <p> The Redskins have been fighting this for two seasons . The passing attack is just blah , same as last year . Brunell 's production Sunday night was puny , just like last year . He was 12 of 25 for 107 yards until some meaningless late-game stat padding . Michael Vick can put up those numbers and win because of his legs . Brunell can not , not at this stage of his career . This is why Saunders came aboard in the first place , but the offense seems a couple of months away from being the kind of symphony he conducted in Kansas City . <p> The defense , stunningly , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shawn Springs is back , which is a lot of pressure to put on a cornerback returning from surgery . We have n't heard Andre Carter 's name called in two weeks . Adam Archuleta has been invisible , which is great for a lineman but not a safety who should be laying the wood to people . <p> The only thing that can save the Redskins from falling into a bottomless pit is Houston on deck and an overrated division . Yes , I just referred to the NFC East as overrated . The Redskins are only one game behind the leaders in the only division with no 2-0 team . <p> Is it possible , based on what we 've seen these first two weeks , that the only thing more overhyped than Notre Dame is the NFC East ? The Eagles blew a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter at home . The Giants should be 0-2 . The Redskins are 0-2 , and it 's not like either loss was a fluke . They were outplayed by both the Vikings and Cowboys . And Dallas is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out with a broken bone in his right ring finger and might have to sit out for up to a month . He can still ride that stationary bike with a busted hand , ca n't he ? <p> Drew Bledsoe , through two games , looks about like Brett Favre these days , which is to say , old . Perhaps the four NFC East teams are only 9-7 good . All four seem obviously flawed , and none seems to be any better than the Bears or Falcons or Vikings or , for that matter , the 2-0 Saints . Gibbs actually found some solace in the fact that nobody in the division is 2-0 . " We 're only one game behind , " he said . <p> What Gibbs and his staff will do , with a great deal of angst this week , is try to figure out how to get the players out of their malaise . It 's not effort or passion or urgency the Redskins lack . Sometimes coaches resort to criticizing a team 's effort , which is an easy way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team 's effort , talked about how desperately his players want to win . <p> The issue appears to be whether they 're good enough , or whether what they 're attempting to do is good enough . The offense has scored one touchdown . One . If the Redskins had played the Ravens and Bears , or Seahawks and Chargers , there might be some easy explainin ' as to what 's happening . <p> But I do n't know any Vikings or Cowboys defenders ( okay , maybe Roy Williams ) who 'll be punching a ticket to the Pro Football Hall of Fame . The Vikings and Cowboys , defensively , are okay . Byron Leftwich did n't have any problem picking apart the Cowboys last week . But Brunell was dumping it off , or running away as if Ed " Too Tall " Jones and Randy White were wearing the helmet with the star . <p> If the Redskins do this again next week , we 'll know they 're at least temporarily out of the running as a contender . They 'll be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the national consciousness until they prove they belong in the conversation . If Brunell does this again next week in Houston , if he 's skipping passes on third down with Brandon Lloyd open , it 'll be time to get The Kid , Jason Campbell , warmed up in the bullpen . Last week was too early for the Redskins to be worried . But this week is past time . That 's how dramatically one lopsided loss down in Dallas can spray-paint graffiti all over the big picture .
