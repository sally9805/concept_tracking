In the four years since we published his story " Halfway House , " Jeremy Minton has published stories in Aeon and The Third Alternative , but the bulk of his creative work has gone into a novel . ( He describes the effort as being akin to rowing across the Atlantic Ocean . ) Of this new story , he says that it exists because " I had a rather nasty nightmare about being buried alive on the same day that I happened to hear a radio documentary about a parasite which does unusual things to shrimp . The question of exactly how those input elements ended up as this story is left to the imagination of the reader . " Your editor recommends instead that you let Mr. Minton do the imagining . Read on- <p> IN THE CRAMPED AND claustrophobic dark , I put my arms around Merrison and wished that I could kill him . We were lying side by side in a cold , stone tunnel which was less than two foot from floor to ceiling . There was no light but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an inch from my face . Above that roof came half a mile or more of solid rock . From somewhere far off , I heard the relentless dripping of water . I could feel the press of Merrison 's gut against my chest , and it enraged me . Fat ! How could he still be fat ? We had been trapped in the tunnels for the best part of a month , eking out our existences on tasteless , watereddown rockfruit . Our bodies were turning into anatomical diagrams but Merrison still carried his fat around with him like a mute confession of a life made easy by other people 's efforts . He shifted against me , and something about our position put me in mind of how it must feel to lie down next to a woman . My empty stomach curdled with disgust and I cursed my own imagination . There was no way I wanted the image of that so-far-only-dreamed-of pleasure to be associated , however fleetingly , with a man as vile as Merrison . I could feel Merrison 's fingers move against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to silence . Urging me ! As if I was still a boy without " brains enough to keep quiet in the dark . Then I realized there was a pattern to what he was doing . He was counting out a number on my face . One . Two . Three . It could only mean one thing , and it was a thing I did n't want to know . I groped around for his right ear , and tugged it . Are you sure ? I tugged harder than I needed to , hoping it would hurt . If it did , he betrayed no sign . His fingers touched my skin in response . Yes . Three knuckledusters , moving in a group . We had learned to talk this way while we were moving in the tunnels , during those moments when visible gestures were useless and speech could get you killed . How far ? I asked . One hundred yards , his fingers answered . Down . It was the worst possible news . In the weeks that we had been trapped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own against the knuckledusters , mainly because the beasts were intensely solitary and seemed even more antagonistic to their own kind than they were to everything else . The idea that they might be starting to move in teams was not a comforting one . I pressed my ear to the ground , straining for some confirmation that Merrison was right . I listened for more than a minute , but heard nothing . It would have been comforting to believe that he had been mistaken but I did not believe it . For a man who never listened , Merrison had astonishingly good hearing . If he said there was something in the tunnels below us then there probably was . I needed to find out . Although I was anxious to get back to our companions , the need to establish the truth of Merrison 's news outweighed the need for speed . The people in The Hollow had already waited three days for the food we were bringing ; they could survive for a few minutes longer . We had passed a drop shaft a hundred or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I signed for Merrison to wait , then tried to turn around and found that the bag was in my way . This was hardly a first : the bag had been causing trouble ever since we had loaded it up with rockfruit at the start of the previous day . It was one more example of the cussedness of this place . The fruit which grew along the shores of Lightless Lake had kept us alive since we had fallen into the tunnels but , honestly , did it have to be so bulky , did it have to be so heavy and awkward to carry ? I moved the bag enough to get past . Truth to tell , I was none too keen to leave it . Over the last week , while our dwindling group had been holed up in The Hollow , I had been comparing the amount of rockfruit we had left with the portions that people were eating . After my contact with Merrison 's belly I had a good idea where the difference had been going . Something scraped between my leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforting weight of my brother 's spear . For a moment I hesitated and then , reluctantly , began to loosen the straps that held it to my leg . This was an obvious necessity : the spear was strong and sturdy , but it would be precious little use against a trio of dusters . Conversely , the risk of accidentally alerting the beasts was too plain to ignore . All the same , it was not easy to do . I hated the idea of Merrison laying his flabby foreigner 's hands on something so personal to me . My brother , Buttress , had given me the spear just before Merrison and I had set off for Lightless Lake . Harsh words had passed between us , and I took his gift as a sign that he , like I , still hoped for a rapprochement . I pushed the spear to the side of the tunnel and began to crawl , struggling as always to find that critical balance between quietness and speed . This tunnel , like all the others down here , was wide enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the space between floor and ceiling was so narrow you could not even get up onto your hands and knees . The only way to move was to drag yourself along on your belly . I had become adept at this but lack of proper food had taken its toll on me : my arms shook when I moved . It took several minutes to reach the edge of the drop shaft . I knew I had got there from the flow of cold air which rose up out of the depths . Tentatively , I traced the outline of the hole . I did it lightly : the edges of these shafts were sharp enough to cut skin . I lay there and waited . In the absence of anything else to chew on , I chewed on my own hate . I thought about Merrison and wondered if I had always been destined to loathe him . I suspected that I had . In a sense I had hated him before I or any of our family had even met him . I had hated him because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was what they called him , although I had never seen him perform any magic unless you could count the stealing of my brother 's wits and conscience , and the words he spouted sounded more like gibberish than wisdom . All through our journey from the sea port at Capeland to the mines in the Borvaine Mountains we had been hearing stories of Magicians and how they were turning the world upside down . Everywhere we went we heard the same things : tales of men with strange clothes and stranger voices ; men who carried outlandish machines in their saddlebags and wild ideas in their heads ; who outraged priests by talking heresy on the steps of their churches ; who infuriated surgeons and scholars by deriding the knowledge they had worked so hard to acquire ; who set the world alight by proving that their wild ideas worked . It was clear to all of us that such men were not to be trusted and nobody , least of all my father , Grapple , was happy about the prospect of putting ourselves under their charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth of the tales were true then the machinery of the Magicians and the deep mines they had opened with it were offering chances of wealth that few of us had even dreamed of . If it had just been a matter of money then we might have resisted temptation . We might have stayed in our own homes , not joined the thousands of others who were sailing and riding and tramping halfway " round the world to swell the throng who labored in the mines . But the riches the Magicians had found were in the form of forizael , and that changed everything . Forizael ! Sweetest of gifts of our world . Bliss for the soul and joy for the senses , a taste that elevated man and raised him nearer God . Wars had been fought for it , kingdoms betrayed for it , princes had died for it . For us it was a sacred thing ; its use lay at the heart of our oldest rituals . Amongst our people , a man who possessed a quantity of forizael would never lack for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardship . We were willing to be led by foreigners and heretics . Or so we told ourselves while we were still at home . Doubts had set in long before we reached the mountains , and they grew a hundredfold when we laid eyes on the vast encampment that stained the ground around the mouth of the mines . Dusk was falling . The Hawk Star shone alone in the sky , scoring the heavens with its ancient , rapid glide , but all thoughts of beauty were cast aside as we looked at the slag heaps and the squalid tents , the iron railroads stretching into the desert . There was not a man among us who did not quail at the sight . No one could look at what had been done to this land and believe that anything virtuous could grow out of such ruin . It was the Magicians who had done this with their steam and iron engines . I hated them for it , but the hate had been abstract , theoretical . Since then , the things I had suffered at their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it personal . I had seen people beaten by weariness , broken by carelessness . I had seen my father worn by useless rage , seen my brother seduced by lies . Most of all , I had seen the stupidity and indifference of this man , Merrison , and the trouble it had brought . Merrison was meant to care for the organizing of rotas and the counting of men in and out of the tunnels , but his only interest was in tearing the heart out of the Earth and in forcing the rest of us ever deeper into unshored , unsafe workings . If he had listened to our warnings that there was peril in the ground , that the men who had gone into the dark and not come back had not met with natural ends , we would not be trapped here now . He had been in charge of our work party as it toiled and sweated in the deepest of the mines . There had been twenty of us in the gallery when the earth-slip happened . We had been hacking away , heedless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . Then the ground had split beneath us and we had tumbled down the broken escarpment we could come to know - and curse - as Long Drop . The Drop , we eventually discovered , was just one wall of our prison . Three days crawl to the South and East-it was Merrison who insisted on the directions , though how he could have known them was a mystery you came to Lightless Lake , a vast , still pool of brackish water with clumps of rockfruit growing on its shores . Five days to the North the tunnels were rent by a sheer , deep fissure at the bottom of which a torrent clashed and clattered . We called this stream the Night Rush . In between these barriers the tunnels stretched , artificial and unfathomable . They ran for miles in all directions , always flat , always straight , always turning at right angles , except at one place toward the heart of the maze where the stark , sharp walls abruptly bowed into a large , egg-shaped depression . This was The Hollow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Days of hard crawling had convinced us that there was nothing else to be found . There was no way out , no road back to the sun . We were alone and trapped in the dark . THE AIR in the drop shaft was chill and smelled of mold . I shuffled cautiously forward and felt it move like a cold breath on my face . Peering down , I could not tell if I was looking into a drop of one foot or a thousand . There was nothing to see and nothing to hear . Nothing , except ... There ! It was very faint . So faint I was amazed that Merrison had managed to hear it so much earlier . It was a sound like fingers , very many fingers , drumming upon stone . Echoes ran ahead of it , but not too far ahead . The duster was in its element : it was approaching fast . I felt a coldness that started in my feet and rose into my guts . The first time we had encountered these creatures had been at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second attempt at climbing back to the human levels . We had not posted a guard , had not known there was anything to guard against . When the duster sprang on us out of the dark we had not known how to fight it . Three of us died that morning and another two were injured . Five out of twenty . Now I was alone with the useless Merrison , and all that was protecting us was thirty feet of drop shaft . Light flowered abruptly in front of me . It was not as bright as a candle , but after so many days in the dark it felt like pepper being rubbed into my eyes . The light swelled , and the footsteps swelled beside it . The duster emerged from the darkness . The first thing you noticed was how well it fitted the tunnel . Each segment of its softly glowing body was like a flattened lozenge , almost as wide as the passageway . Thin but powerful arms thrust out from the sides of its body . They were jointed so that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beast on its way . There was not an inch of space between carapace and roof , but there was some clearance below . Knuckledusters ran with their bodies clear of the ground , leaving enough space for their claws to slash through the air . I counted the segments . In spite of the noise , it was just a little specimen , only seven segments long . Dusters kill by running over your body and tearing it . The more legs you had attacking you , the worse your chances of survival . No duster was easy to handle , but a beast like this could be fended off with skill . Between ten and fifteen segments you might survive if you were exceptionally lucky . Anything more than that , forget it . The duster 's tail flashed past and the radiance swiftly faded . The fact that dusters glowed infuriated Merrison . " It makes no sense , " he 'd protest . " The creatures are blind so light is no use to them . In fact , it works against them by making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , " my father had replied . It was a few hours after our failed attempt on Long Drop . We had taken our dead and wounded and retreated to The Hollow , which was the nearest thing we had found to a defensible position . Lock , who had been nominated as our healer on the grounds that he was marginally less unqualified than any of the rest of us , was going around doing what he could to comfort those who were injured . In most cases this consisted of little more than making soothing noises . None of us was saying very much . We were in that dazed and fractured state when numbness gradually segues into shock . After what had happened that day , only a man like Merrison would have thought to use a word like easy in connection with the dusters . Most normal men would have noted Grapple 's anger and shut up , but Merrison had kept on muttering about how the dusters did n't make sense . For the rest of us the fact that they were killing us was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I genuinely believed , would have put up with being eaten if the creatures would just stop offending his sense of order . I thought about the Magician as I waited for the second duster . Of all the crimes he had committed , all the reasons he had given me to hate him , I thought that the greatest was the way he had stolen my brother from me . Buttress and I had always been close . That was why it felt like such a betrayal when I discovered how much he had fallen under Merrison 's spell . " How can you bear to listen to him ? " I had demanded of my brother after a particularly asinine pronouncement from the overseer . " He does n't even talk properly . " " He talks differently , Brand , " Buttress replied , proffering the word with exaggerated patience . But Buttress was wrong about this . Merrison was not just different . I had spoken to enough people from enough places in the world to recognize speech that was merely different . I 'd seen folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences back to front . Merrison rarely did either of these things . Instead , he spoke as if his throat had never been intended to produce proper speech and did so under sufferance . When the words came out they sounded strained , as if some part of his tongue was being bent in an unnatural direction . It was n't just the way he spoke , it was the things he chose to say . He was always brimming over with ideas and innovations , new ways of doing things . As if the old ways had n't served men perfectly well since the time of the sages . " And his name does n't even mean anything , " I 'd added , sure that this would be enough to scupper the Magician 's credibility . I had grown up surrounded by people whose names were a reminder that they were merely tools of the Creator , that their purpose in life was to raise the stones of His city . How could one expect to hear wisdom from a man whose name was just a meaningless jumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , but he just looked at me and said : " So ? " Things had grown worse after we fell into the tunnels . It had been my hope that since Merrison had been to blame for the disaster he might have had the grace to shut up . Instead , he seemed determined to impose himself upon us . He insisted that he alone possessed the skills to get us out of the tunnels . My father treated this assertion with the contempt it clearly deserved , but Buttress seemed willing to take the buffoon at his word . He even chose to speak against my father and in favor of Merrison when plans were being laid for how we would escape . I broke off from my musings and realized that some considerable time had passed while I waited at the top of the drop shaft . At least I thought it had . It was hard to judge when you were alone in the dark . No duster had appeared and I had just about convinced myself that Merrison must , for once , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lots of drumming . It seemed like a lifetime before the duster finally appeared . It was indistinguishable from its predecessor , except that there was more of it . Much , much more . I counted forty-five segments before the tail came into view . I watched it come . I watched it go . And for a long time afterward I listened to the echo of its retreating feet . Something touched my leg . I almost shouted . I waited for my heartbeat to slow down , then said : " Are you trying to scare me witless ? " " I 'm sorry , " said Merrison , not sounding it at all . " I did n't know how else to attract your attention . " " You could try making some noise when you move . " It was a stupid thing to say , and I knew it . I should have envied his silence , not resented it . " What is it you want ? " I said . " I came to see if you were all right ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ? " " Both , not all . There were only two of them . But the last one was a monster . More than forty segments . " " More than - ? You 're joking ! " " Is that the kind of thing I 'd joke about ? There were forty-five segments . I counted them . " There was a long silence , then he said , " I never dreamed that they could grow so big . " He sounded like a man who had just received a death sentence . " Well , that 's it , I guess . Now your father 's going to have to move . " I swung my head toward him , even though this was pointless in the dark . " What do you mean , now my father 's going to have to move ? My father always intended to move . The whole point of sending us back to Lightless Lake was to stock up with provisions for another attempt on the escarpment . " " Is that what you think he 's doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was an intensity in Merrison 's voice which I had never heard before . And something very curious was happening . In spite of the blackness , I was convinced that he was looking right at me . Looking at me and seeing me . " Of course it 's what I believe , " I said . " What else would he be doing ? " " I do n't know , " said Merrison . " You know him better than I. But does he not look to you like a man who 's taken one blow too many , lost one friend too many ? Does he not look like a man who would rather crouch in a corner than take the risk of losing anyone else ? " " No he does n't ! " I seethed , wishing I could shout at the top of my lungs , shout loud enough to drown out my own doubt . " No need to lose your temper . I 'm not asserting anything . All I 'm doing is asking you some questions . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can see that . I do n't suppose you 'll want to hear what I 'm going to say next , either . We have to change our route home . " " What do you mean ? " I said . " We ca n't afford to go back the way we came . It 's going to take too long , especially dragging the bag . It was different on the way out : it was worth the extra time to cut the risk of running into dusters . But if a fortyfive segment duster decides to visit The Hollow , nobody there is going to stand a chance . We have to get back and get them to move out . That means going down this drop shaft . " It went against the grain to be agreeing with Merrison , but I could see the strength of his argument . There was one thing I did n't understand though . " What makes you think that going that way will be any quicker than going back the way we came ? Or any riskier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are in is a back-route , a minor tributary , while the tunnel below is the main arterial route from Lightless Lake to the North side of the system . That means it 's heavily traveled . The good news is that we do n't need to be on it very long . By my reckoning , we have about forty-five minutes hard crawling , then we 'll hit a lateral that will take us back to The Hollow . " " How do you know all this stuff ? " I said . " I have a knack for geography , Brand . Even in a place like this I generally know where I am and where other things are in relation to me . I 'd have thought you 'd have noticed by now . Or have you been too busy despising me to spot that I 've been keeping you alive ? " I did n't answer that . We groped around the inside of the drop shaft until we located the ladder . I say ladder , but it was more like a series of grooves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it would be there because all of the shafts which we had encountered had possessed equivalent structures . The ladders were one more reminder that the tunnels had not been built with human needs in mind : the groves were too narrow and set too far apart . They were shaped specifically for the spatulate feet of knuckledusters . There was also , we discovered , a more basic problem with the drop shaft . It was just a little bit too narrow for either of us to get into with a bag full of rockfruit on our backs . We spent half an hour or more demonstrating that it really would not go , and by the end we were both hot , irritable , and frustrated . " This is ludicrous , " I whispered , speaking to his ear through my cupped hands . I could have signed it , but sometimes you just need to speak . " If we carry on like this , it 'll end up being slower than going the long way " round . " " If we had some rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " I said , " but we do n't . Have you any other suggestions ? " " We could drop the bag down the shaft . " " And smash half the fruit in the process . " Merrison said : " I know . You go down the ladder . I 'll lower the bag onto your shoulders . You 'll have to carry all the weight , but it should n't be for more than a couple of minutes . You should be able to manage . " I said : " I 've got another idea . Why do n't you climb into the shaft and I 'll lower the bag onto your shoulders ? " " Because you 're younger than me , fitter than me , and you have a better sense of balance . " Well , he was right about me being younger , but I was frankly dubious about the other parts of his claim . But I could already see that this was going to be one of those situations where no amount of arguing would have any effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept it . After so long lying horizontal it was a blessing to stretch my limbs and stand up like a man . I was just beginning to enjoy it when I heard Merrison say : " Are you ready ? I want to lower the bag . " " Let me get down a little further . " I wanted to be as far down as possible before having to take the weight . In spite of Merrison 's assurances , I was not looking forward to the challenge . My limbs were weak from days without food , and the rungs of the ladder were slippery and difficult . " It 's coming down . " Oh , good , I thought . I 'm so pleased . The bag proved every bit as awkward , heavy , and difficult to balance as I 'd feared . The rungs of the ladder were not evenly spaced , and to find the next one I had to wave my foot around , banging it against the rock until I found the gap . The first hint I had that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and failed to find a further indentation . I groped around , stretching as far as I could , but did not get any joy . I pulled my right foot back , positioning it on the step , and repeated the procedure with my left . That was when things really started to go wrong . I had been carrying the bag longways on , which made it more unstable but meant that its weight was distributed directly down the line of my body . As I started to wave my leg around , the bag began to tip . I tried to correct the motion with my arm but it was hard to judge the force correctly . The bag swayed the other way and this time I was unable to stop it . It teetered , tottered , and fell backward . I waited for the crash . It did n't come . I could still feel the weight on my neck although it was not as heavy as before . The bag had come to rest against the far side of the shaft . The combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a few experimental movements were enough to convince me that if I removed any part of my support , it would immediately fall . " Merrison , " I called , pitching my voice as low as I could . " Yes , " he said . " What is it ? " " The bag 's stuck . " " Oh Hell ! What do you mean stuck ? " What part of " stuck " was he unable to understand ? Quickly , I explained what had happened . " Stay there , " he said , helpfully . " I have an idea . " There was silence for a moment then , without warning , the bag began to move . " What are you doing ? " I said . " I 'm trying to shift the bag . " " What with ? " " Your spear . " I was just a split second too slow in realizing how bad an idea that might be . " Which end are you poking it with ? " The question was already redundant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its blade was honed and sharpened and keen . And it was jabbing the top of the bag . The fabric ripped . The bag was filled to bursting and a single gash was all it took to send rockfruit crashing down . A fruit the size of a skull smacked into my hand , and my grip was lost in an instant . I tried to roll but the shape of the shaft was against me . I could n't say for sure , but the bruises I collected and my own confused recollections both suggest that I managed to bounce off several walls before ending up face down along the line of the tunnel . I tried to get up and the roof smacked me hard on the back of the head as a reminder not to be stupid . I let out a groan and it seemed to help , so I decided to do it again . I saw no point in trying to be quiet . Echoes crashed and capered down the tunnel . They seemed to go on forever . I dragged myself back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then thought : What 's the use ? The knuckleduster was coming . It knew I was there and it was coming to get me . I might just get to the top of the shaft , but that would n't buy me more than five seconds of life and it did n't seem worth the effort , even for the consolation of having Merrison die alongside me . " Brand ! " I could hear him calling . " Brand ! Where the hell are you ? " I did n't answer . I was going to die and I did n't want to spend my final seconds engaged in a moronic conversation . " Brand , if you 're at the bottom of the drop shaft , get out of the way . Get back down the tunnel . Move ! " I remained convinced that the situation was hopeless , but there was such urgency in his voice that I found myself obeying anyway . I put my feet against the wall and shoved . I was on my back now , the roof of the tunnel reflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , pulled myself along , kicking at the walls for extra speed . I was moving away from danger but my pace was suicidally slow . Light spilled into my eyes . The duster was at the end of the corridor . I could hear its footsteps like a fatal drum roll . It came so fast that it was just a blur of light . This , I thought , must be the view a man on a mountain sees in the seconds before an avalanche overwhelms him . At the very end , my courage failed . I closed my eyes and waited for oblivion . THREE DAYS EARLIER , on the night that Merrison and I had been dispatched to Lightless Lake , the Magician had told us a tale . More than a week had passed since our second disastrous attempt to climb up the escarpment , and nobody seemed to have any idea what we were going to do next . A rockwood fire had been lit at the center of The Hollow and most of us were gathered around it , staring into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly dying . Nobody was doing very much . It was quiet enough for the soft hiss of the fire to be heard . Rockwood is one of the mysteries of the tunnels , as strange in its way as the fruit that springs from its branches . It grows without light , and it burns very slowly , almost without smoke . Even in the confines of The Hollow , it left only the faintest fragrance on the air . Lock was moving amongst the injured , doling out sips of water or a few sad fragments of our steadily diminishing stocks of rockfruit . His movements were desultory . In the morbid rockwood light he looked like a spider doing an inspection of its prey . Only Buttress still showed signs of purpose . He sat by the entrance of The Hollow , with a small pile of rockwood and discarded rockfruit husks in front of him . He was using his knife to peel off long thin fibers from the husks , and when he had assembled enough of these , he would twist them into a rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planks together . To try and take away the sting of the darkness , we told each other tales . This had become a habit during our time in The Hollow . To begin with we had been scrupulous about preserving silence for as much of the time as we could , but the longer we stayed in The Hollow the more it had come to seem , in a perverse sort of way , like home . We were comfortable there . We could talk to each other there . Each of us would speak in turn , breaking out of our thoughts and speaking words that we had learned by heart years back . The tales we told were ones I had been hearing all my life but never before had they sounded so much like a requiem . When the last voice fell silent it was as if the breath had been stolen from the room . That night , Buttress turned to Merrison and said : " And what of you , Master Magician ? Do you have a story for us ? " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no teller of tales . " " But you do know something , " said Buttress . " Something that is new . " " It will be new to you , I think , although it is older than worlds . " That made no sense to me , but before I had a chance to protest , my brother had urged Merrison to begin . " Far away , " he said , " and long ago , before the men and women of this world had even learned to strike flame from dry kindling or balance one rock on top of another and call it a home , there were two empires . They were very old and rich and powerful , and each was convinced that their way of doing things was the best way . " To the Gradyne , Might and Honor were the greatest virtues a person could possess . They raised vast armies and , with their aid , brought law and order to everyone around them . And this , they said , was good . The Illowain saw life differently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire , although their sphere of influence was just as vast as that of the Gradyne . They called themselves " The Alliance " and elevated Choice and Freedom above all other things . " For centuries , these Powers had grown and prospered , each ignorant of the other . But , inevitably , they came into contact , and it was not a happy experience . The more each Power learned of the other , the more they disliked what they heard . The Gradyne saw the Illowain as anarchists , wreckers of order . The Illowain saw the Empire as unthinking militarists whose only desire was to make everything the same as everything else . " And so they came to blows . They fought with words to begin with . They competed in sport and trade and art . And when none of these alternatives to combat proved sufficient , they fought in earnest . They fought in secret ; dirty little skirmishes over worthless territory , and then bigger , bloodier battles fought for Honor and Principle . " And still it was not enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by acts of deliberate malice . Cities burned , then continents , then worlds . Whole new disciplines in the ans of destruction were invented and deployed . Seas were drained and stars snuffed out . And by the time the men and women on both sides realized how far they had come , it was too late to pull back . Their only hopes were victory or death . " And so they fought until death and killing was all they could remember . Until all that was left of the glory of their empires was the memory of how to throw rocks at each other . And in the end , even that was gone and nothing remained at all , except for rumors and stories in the mouths of those who came afterward , and except for the weapons that waited still , ready to rise up and slay a foe who no longer existed . " When Merrison stopped it took us a moment to realize that this was the end of the story . There was a sound of people shuffling . No one knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And is there a point to your tale ? " Merrison said , " The story is true . If you 're looking for a meaning you must find it for yourself . " More silence . " To me , " said Buttress , " the meaning is perfectly clear : those who will not change course when threatened by a thunderstorm will surely be soaked to the skin . " There was a stir around The Hollow as he said this . There was not a man present who did not recognize this as a challenge to our father . I wanted to leap to my feet , to speak in Grapple 's defense , but a glance in his direction told me I should not . My father did not need anyone to fight his battles for him . Yet it was plain that this act of defiance cut him more deeply than any of the woes that had befallen us since we had come to this dreadful place . He rubbed his chest as if his heart were hurting . " If you have something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a foolish , weak old man and I lack the wits to see through such picturesque talk . " " I have never used any of those terms to describe you , " said Buttress , and I wanted to take him by the throat and shout in his face , No , but your every action tells us that you think them ! Still I held my peace . " But since you ask for plainness , I will give it . We can not stay here . This place is fatal for us . Each hour we remain our state becomes more hopeless . This is the strongest , best defended ground we have discovered but it is not strong enough . Another attack will come , and even if we fend it off , more of us will be killed or injured . The next attack will be worse , and the next one after that , and so it will go until the last of us is taken . " For several moments Grapple moved his mouth but no words were able to emerge . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with ground glass in his joints . He raised his head to stare at my brother and I was close enough to see that his eyes were shining with tears . " Have you anything useful to say ? Or is your sole purpose to drown out every vestige of hope ? " " Yes , I have something to say , " replied my brother . " I say that we must leave . We must quit while we still can . " At this it became impossible for me to hold my tongue any longer . " My brother has lost his wits in the darkness , " I exclaimed . " We must leave , he says . Idiot ! Lack-brain ! What does he think we have been trying to do all this time ? " Buttress spread his palms toward me as if my rage was something he understood and welcomed . It was a gesture he had borrowed from Merrison , and it dismayed me more than any show of fury might have done . " Whatever we have been trying to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made two attempts to climb Long Drop . Both have ended in failure . A third attempt is planned , but we are weaker now and the dusters are more numerous . There is every chance that this third assay will prove even more lethal than the rest . We must find another way . " " What way ? " snapped Grapple . Buttress replied : " The Night Rush is our only hope . Rockwood is light and strong . " He held up one of the pieces of planking that he had been working on . " We can build a raft and ride the stream out of the darkness . " " Is that it ? " sneered Grapple . " I thought you had something new to say , not just this sad old lunacy of rafts and torrents . We 've heard it all before . " Merrison said : " You 've heard , but have you tried to listen ? " " You keep out of this , " said Lock . " You 're an outsider here ; this is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life will be forfeit if we do not make better choices . I 'd say that means I have a stake in what 's decided . " Before Lock could answer , one of the men in the corner sat up and spoke . " And what of my life ? " It was my cousin , Hammer , who had lost his hand and taken other hurts during the first of the duster attacks . He had been drifting in and out of consciousness and none of us had thought that he was even aware of the argument . " What of my life ? You speak of chances and hope . But I have heard the thunder of the Night Rush . Even a strong man might be broken in such currents , and those of us who are weakened and wounded , what chance do we have ? It will be our bones that are returned to the daylight if anything is ever returned at all . " " Will your chances be any better , " said Buttress , " if you stay here and wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains . " " That is not true , " said Grapple . " There is another way out . The way up Long Drop . The way that we came down . " Buttress was shaking his head and digging his fingers into his ears , as if he could not believe the things he was hearing . " But we 've already tned that way . We 've tried it twice and both times the dusters have driven us back . " " We failed because we went about it wrong , " said Grapple . " We were underprepared . We need to build up our strength . " " And how will we do that , " demanded Merrison , " when our stocks of rockfruit will only last another day if half of us refrain from eating it at all ? " " If that 's true , " I said hotly , " if our stocks really aie that depleted , it 's only because somebody has been taking more than their fair share . " There were nods and murmurs of agreement . Evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a thief in our midst . But Merrison just shrugged as if he did n't realize his honor had been challenged . Grapple said : " There are fresh supplies of fruit at Lightless Lake . I saw them growing there . By now they should be ripe enough to eat . " Buttress said : " Lightless Lake is a day and a half away . That 's three days there and back . " Grapple said : " In which case , you 'd better get moving . It 's about time you and your trickster friend did something to earn your keep . You 've done damn all since we came down here , except skulk around avoiding trouble and trying to undermine my authority . " I saw Buttress flinch , and even though I was angry at my brother 's behavior I still felt that the words were unfair . Buttress had fought as hard as any of us . The fact that he was uninjured was a tribute to his skill and strength , not any sign of cowardice or laziness . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the food we need . Once we 've fed we 'll be ready to make another attempt on the cliff . " I saw Buttress glance at Merrison and I saw the tiny nod the Magician gave in response and then I heard my brother say : " If that is your instruction , Father , then of course we will - " Before he could say any more , I blurted out : " You ca n't let them go ! " For the first time that evening I felt my father 's eyes staring directly at me . They were hot with anger . " Are all my sons determined to rebel against me ? " " I 'm not trying to rebel , " I said . " I 'm trying to warn you . If you let the two of them go , they 'll disappear and never come back . They 're building a raft . I 've seen it . They 've been working on it together after the rest of us have gone to sleep . " " You little sneak ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Better a sneak than a traitor , " said my father . " I 'm not a traitor , " said Buttress . " We need a raft . We will all die without it . " " I do n't give a damn what you need , " said Grapple . " I need people I can trust . My son Brand has proved himself to be such a person . He will go with the Magician and make sure that he comes back . " I was scared when I heard these words , but also exhilarated . For the first time in my life my father was giving me the chance to act like a man . I tried not to think that he might also be giving me the chance to die like one . As we were preparing to depart , my brother sidled over to me . I thought he was going to remonstrate with me further but instead I felt him pushing something into my hands . " You 'd better take this , " he said . " I do n't suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and I 'd feel better if I knew you were carrying it . " I was tempted to thrust the spear back at him and tell him that I had no interest in how well or badly he felt , but then I looked at him and saw how much this gesture had cost . I took the spear and thrust it into its carrying straps . " Come on , " I said to Merrison . " We 'd better be gone if we 're going . " Various farewells , my brother 's chief among them , had floated down the tunnel after us , but I was caught up in the excitement of the moment and did not think to reply . I like to believe that if I had known what was coming I 'd have found the strength of heart to thank him . WHEN I OPENED my eyes the first thing I saw was the duster . Its open mouth lay less than a dozen inches from my toes . Half the blood in its body seemed to have exploded from its throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No reaction . The creature was definitely dead . " Brand ? " It was Merrison 's voice , muffled , slightly breathless . " Brand , are you all right ? " " I 'm fine , " I said , still trying to work out how that could be true . " I 'm surprised half out of my wits , but other than that I 'm fine . Where are you ? " " At the bottom of the shaft . I 've got a bit of a problem . Do you think you could give me a hand ? " I looked at the fallen duster . The pallid light of its body still illuminated the darkness although death was already dimming its radiance . I reckoned there was just about enough space between the body and the wall for me to wriggle past . A few minutes struggle brought me down to Merrison . All I could see of him was his boots and the lower parts of his legs . The rest of him was still inside the drop shaft . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut me out . " His voice was strained and breathless . " What in God 's name happened ? " I said . For a moment I wondered whether I ought to go back to signing but then dismissed the idea . If there were any other dusters within earshot they already knew we were there . " I killed it . Wrapped myself around your spear , dropped down the shah , let gravity do the work . " With that critical piece of information , the scene began to make sense . It looked as if the spear had gone through the scales and through the duster 's body and out the other side . I was more than just impressed , I was awestruck . And then I saw something else , something that made me blanch . " Blood of the sages , " I whispered . Merrison must have heard the change in my voice . " It 's all right , " he said . But it was n't all right . It was n't all right at all . The spear was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the shaft had skewered the base of Merrison 's right leg . " Your leg , " I breathed . " Forget about it , " he said , and now the pain in his voice was obvious . " It 's not important . I need you to help me here . You 've still got your knife , have n't you ? You need to cut away the body . If you attack it at the gap between two of the scales it will probably be easier . " " But - " " Brand , I appreciate your concern but it really is n't helping . I need you to stop standing there and do what I ask . Okay ? " His words shamed me in a way that I had never known before . This was the man whom I had dismissed as a weakling and a coward ? I got to work , and it was every bit as tough and disgusting as I had expected it would be . A ripe , cheesy smell came off the duster 's body , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out beneath the blade of my knife . Eventually I succeeded in cutting Merrison free . We were both covered in gore and bits of duster flesh . " Can you hold onto the shaft while I pull my leg away ? " said Merrison . " Try not to break it ; we may well need it again . " I could only hope he was talking about the spear . I nodded , and we did what we needed to do . There was just enough light to see the hole in Merrison 's leg . It was small and neat and the spear had missed the bone , but it was still a ghastly sight . He dragged himself down the side of the duster and lay with his back to the wall , hands pressed tightly round his knee . He was gasping softly . I had no idea how we were going to get back to The Hollow . In theory , we were only a couple of hours away , but with his leg in the state it was , that might as well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Wait , " he answered . " Give me a few minutes and then I 'll be ready to move . " I admired his courage , but it was clear that he did not know what he was talking about . I said , " I think it would be better if I tried to get back on my own . I 'll get the others ; we can come back and help you . " " No , " he said . " It 'll be all right . Honestly . Look . " And he rolled up the cloth of his trouser leg to show me . I turned my head away . " Look , " he said again , more insistently . So I looked , and I did not believe what I saw . In front of my eyes , the ruined meat of his leg was building itself back up . I could literally see it growing . And for the first time I realized that although there was muck and gore spread over both his legs there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gaze away from that impossible injury and looked into his eyes and saw he was smiling at me . " Is it magic ? " I said . " Not magic , " he replied . " Technology . " This was not a word I knew , and from its oddly angled syllables I got the impression that , for the first time since I had known him , he was speaking a word that came entirely naturally to him . " Augmented bio-repair , they call it . It 's something built into our bodies to help us fight infections , cope with accidents and trauma . They expect life to get rough in the Recovery Corps and so they make us tough . " For a moment the smile faltered and a look of nausea flashed across his face . " Though never quite as tough as we would like . " " I do n't understand , " I said . " No reason why you should . And there 's not a lot of time for proper explanations . Do you remember the story I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember , " I said . " I assumed it was something you made up in order to annoy my father . " " I might have told it for that reason , but the story is true , as I said . The Illowain and the Gradyne both existed . They fought themselves to destruction in exactly the way I told . And thousands of years after the war was over , the weapons that they left behind are still lying around causing havoc . When my own people left their world and started to travel amongst the stars they found whole systems that had been reduced to ruins as a result of that long-ago conflict . " " So it 's true then ? " I said . " The Magicians really do come from a different world ? " " Different world , different star . Some of my people decided we ought to do something to try and clean up the mess that the war had left . After all , a lot of that hardware was as dangerous to us as it was to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit out of it . That 's how the Corps was born . " " And is that what you 're here for ? " " Not exactly . " He paused to probe the edges of his wound with the tips of his fingers . The skin was mottled with bruises but it was starting to knit together . " Look , I 'm going to be ready to move in a few more minutes , but before we go there 's things we need to do . " " What things ? " " First of all we need to get our clothes off . " I gaped at him . A number of the other , more lurid , stories about the nature and practices of Magicians had just come rushing back to me . He saw my expression and I 'll swear it made him grin . " Not for that , " he said . " Even if you were my type , which you 're not , I 'd hardly say our present situation was conducive to romance . We need to get our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knuckledusters , if you had n't figured it out already , have a highly developed sense of smell . I suspect there are plenty of them around here already and they 're only hanging back because this one 's death scream will have got them spooked . But if we start crawling through the tunnels with this gore sticking to us we might as well be banging a dinner gong . " What we need to do is root around and see if we can find any of the fruit that might have survived the fall . " " Why do we need rockfruit ? " I said . " It 's heavy , hard to carry and tastes like watered-down turd . Why do n't we just carve some meat off and then get out of here ? " " The meat 's not a bad idea . Lord knows , we could use the protein . Although I think you might find that the taste is pretty rancid . But I was n't thinking of the rockfruit for food . If we can get hold of the husk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soap , get the worst of the muck off our bodies . " " How do you know this stuff ? " I said as I started to peel off my shirt . His tone as he answered was unexpectedly grim . " I know because I have seen it before , or something very like it . " He had found a chunk of rockfruit beneath a claw of the duster . He bent and handed it to me , wincing at the pressure on his leg . I frowned and then , following his example , started to rub the stuff into my skin . It was n't exactly like soap and did n't exactly smell pleasant , but it did form a crust with the muck on our skins , and after a few minutes that crust could be peeled off . " You asked how we got here , " he said . " Basically , it was an accident . We were on another world , a long way from here and an even longer way from anywhere much else . We were doing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the gist is : we got careless . Things got out of hand , several of my comrades were killed and our ship was badly damaged . The mess we were in was bad enough that we could n't stay in that star system but our ship was no longer in a state where it could have got us back to human space . We just had to find a bolt hole , somewhere we could run to . " Nobody knew anything about this world . In fact , we did n't even know for sure that there was a world here . The best the computers could offer us was a reasonable probability that there would be a life-supporting world here . We got lucky on that count if not on anything else . We made it here , but our engines were totally wrecked . They need six months in an exotic matter workshop before there 's any hope of them firing again . Which made it a bit regrettable that your world was just about entering the steam age . " He peeled the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . " So there we were , " he said . " Stuck on a world where we did n't belong with no hope of rescue . And that was n't the worst thing either . " " What was ? " I said . " The fact that this world had once been touched by the war . Not dramatically - it had been touched rather than hit , but there were signs of it everywhere for those with eyes to see . " " What signs ? " " Well , the most obvious one is the thing you call the Hawk Star . It 's actually an Illowain observation satellite . We reckon it 's been staring down at you for the last ten thousand years or so , waiting to beam news about the kind of civilization you 'd eventually turn into back to a place that no longer exists . " I suppose in a lot of ways you were lucky it was the Alliance that found you rather than the Empire . The Illowain had a policy of leaving folk alone until the folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling then you 'd definitely have known about it . The thing is , though , you should n't run away with the idea that the Illowain were unambiguously good guys . They were caught up in a war and they were only prepared to follow their principles so far . They were prepared to tolerate the idea of planets staying neutral , but they were n't prepared to run the risk of having a neutral world go over to the enemy . So when they came across a world that was n't ready to become part of the Alliance , they would leave some stuff behind to make sure it did n't become part of the Empire . " " What sort of stuff ? " I said . Then , before he could answer , I figured it out for myself . " You mean , weapons and stuff like like that ? " " Stuff like that , " said Merrison . " Yes . " " And you think that the knuckledusters might be one of the things they left ? " " Maybe . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did take place thousands of years ago , then the dusters could n't have been running around underground for all that time . " He did n't answer . Instead , he tensed and lowered his ear to the ground . " There is an answer to that , at least I think there is , but I ca n't give it to you now . For one thing I might not be right , and even if I am you wo n't want to believe me . For another , there is n't time . I have a feeling that things are going to get nasty " round here . Let 's hack off some meat and get gone . Once we 're back at The Hollow there 'll be more time to talk . " The journey back to The Hollow was not a pleasant one . Crawling through the tunnels in nothing but our skin was painful , difficult , and uncomfortable . All the same , when we were finally reunited with the rest of the group I almost found myself wishing that the journey had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions . I felt as if I had fallen into one of those tales where a man awakes from sleep and finds that everyone he knew is aged or mad or dead . Apart from the pallor of decay and despair hanging over everything , nothing appeared to have changed in the time we had been away . Lock still huddled over the rockwood fire , fighting a chill that could not be assuaged . My father glowered in the comer as though afraid to be too close to the entrance . Hammer , amazingly , still lay with his back to the wall . I could not believe that my cousin had survived as long as he had , but from his ragged breathing it was clear to me he could not last much longer . Then I noticed that one thing definitely was different . Buttress was not there . " What happened to him ? " I demanded . " Dead , " said Lock , and I was horrified to hear a note of satisfaction in his voice . " How did he die ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My father grunted an acknowledgment but refused to meet my eyes . Lock picked up pieces of rockwood and forced them into the flames . The curious shrinkage I had previously seen in my father appeared to have infected the remainder of the group . As he hunched over the fire , Lock 's body looked twisted out of true . It was as if something had pulled his joints from their sockets and carelessly forced them together . The others were the same . There was a gauntness in their bodies , a desperation in their eyes . They seemed shriveled half to death . They had gathered rocks and boulders from outside the chamber and piled them along the walls as if they sensed their own diminution and feared being eaten by shadows if they failed to fill the space . We told our story . At Merrison 's request I made no mention of the things I had learned about him . I was loath to deceive the others but I accepted his argument that it was the right thing to do . He was already hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for knowing what he was . When we finished , there was silence . It was Lock who broke it . The doctor 's voice was rattly and thin , as if his vocal chords had been replaced by cobweb . " We are doomed . " It sounded as if even the idea of hope was a burden he was no longer able to bear . Merrison said : " We are doomed if we let ourselves be doomed . " And I chimed in : " We are doomed if we stay here . " " We are doomed whatever we do . The dusters will come . That thing your mad courage killed will draw them in . They will come and hunt us down and we will be consumed . " " Yes , you 're right ! " I exclaimed . " That will surely happen if we remain here . But if we move , if we take what we have and run , there is still a chance for us . " " You sound like your treacherous brother , " said Grapple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He told the truth and none of us had the guts to listen . " " Guts ? " said Lock . " He wanted us to run . " " Yes , and he was right . " Before I could say any more , another voice piped up . " Do you want me to run , as well , Brand ? " It was Hammer , my cousin , speaking . Of course it was . I had this mad idea that we were going to go through the exact same argument we had had three days before with me playing the role of my brother . " Would you like to see me run ? Or do you really mean that you want to run yourself and leave the rest of us for the dusters ? " His throat was so clotted with blood and phlegm that his words were all but incomprehensible . Grapple said : " There will be no running . There will be no more efforts to argue with our fate . Our course was set when we fell into this place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to escape it . Better to die with honor , killing as many of the monsters as we can , than be chased through the tunnels and picked off one by one . " " Honor ! " exclaimed Merrison . " There can be no honor in a situation like this . The dusters have no care for how you live or die ; you can not believe that your courage will earn their respect . " " I do not care for their respect ; I care about my own . " At that moment , Hammer began to rattle and thrash . His head shook back and forth . From right across The Hollow , I could hear his forehead cracking on the stone . Merrison jumped to his feet . He bent over the writhing body and I wondered if he was reaching out to help , or if he meant to administer a killing blow and put an end to at least one part of our dilemma . I spoke again , still trying to sway my father . " Death with honor is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trying to survive than in laying down our lives for nothing ? Is n't it clear - " There was a noise from the far side of the room . A curiously liquid thud followed by a grunt . My father got to his feet . He tried to stand straight , but was unable . His legs were bowed , his back contorted , his arms were like bent branches . Only his glare was true . " Clear ? " he raged . " I 'll tell you what 's clear . It 's clear that neither of my sons has ever been possessed of either brains or guts . A couple of hours in the company of this Magician is enough to turn them into cravens and traitors . Do you think I am blind to your ambition ? Do you think I do not see that you seek to usurp my authority ? " " That is n't true , " I said . " All I have ever done is what was best for all of us . " He spat on the floor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That makes it even worse . You 're not just a traitor , you 're a fool who does n't realize what he 's sold himself for . You probably still think this bastard saved your life . " " He did save my life , " I said . " Idiot ! " said Grapple . " You would never even have been in that tunnel if it had n't been for him . He got you to go down there and then dropped rockfruit on you to make sure the duster would return . " " That is n't how it happened ! If he 'd wanted to kill me , why would he kill the duster ? " " Not for love of you . Oh , it was convenient enough that you happened to survive , but it was never really the point . The point was to make sure the rest of us were screwed . " Grapple grabbed hold of the meat we had brought back and waved it in my face . " He not only killed the duster , ensuring that the tunnels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed the rockfruit that might have sustained us and replaced it with this shit . You might find the meat a little rancid , " he squealed , lifting his voice in a parody of Merrison 's . " More than a little ! The fucking stuff is poison . Your life-saving friend has been out to kill us all . " And he upended the bag and tipped it onto the fire . " It is n't true , " said Merrison . " Not one word is true . " There was something wrong with his voice . It sounded as if there was something in his throat . I turned to see what had happened and gave a gasp of horror . There was a knife sticking out of his neck . It was Hammer 's ; he must have had it hidden under the blankets . I could see the wooden handle , I could see the shining metal . There was blood running out " round the blade . " You 're meant to fall down and die , " said Lock , as if explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disappoint you , " said Merrison . I could see his hands trying to move , trying to reach for the blade in his neck . Trying to move and failing . I remembered the paralysis that had gripped him when pierced by my brother 's spear . This looked like that , only worse . " I 'm not disappointed , " said Lock . " If you were already dead I would n't be able to do this . " He hit the Magician full in the face and then kicked his legs out from underneath him . Merrison fell like a tree trunk . His face smashed into the ground about a foot away from the fire . " Lie there and burn , " said Lock . " Forget about him , " said Grapple . " There 's hardly any time left . " I had thought that all the meat my father had dumped would have extinguished the fire , but it had not . And although rockwood did not burn especially hot , there had been enough warmth in there to set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking flesh flooded the air , and my mouth responded with saliva . It certainly did not smell as if it were poison . And then , as the aroma thickened , I realized something else . Dusters have a phenomenal sense of smell . I stared at the fire in shock . " You 're going to draw them in ! You 're going to make them come ! " " Oh , hush your noise , " said Grapple . " They would be coming anyway . " As if his words had summoned them , I heard the sound of drumming feet . My father turned " round and grabbed a couple of those stones I had seen before , and started dragging them toward the mouth of the cave . " We 've known that all along , and we 've been making preparations while you 've been plotting to betray us . " " What preparations ? " All the group was moving . Even Hammer was on his feet , although he was so enfeebled he could hardly lift a pebble . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seal ourselves up . Keep ourselves safe forever . " Grapple was grunting with effort , trying to push a boulder half as big as himself in the direction of the entrance . " That 's insane ! " I shouted . " We do n't have much food and hardly any water . We 're not going to be safe , we 're all going to die ! " Merrison spoke . His mouth was pressed against the ground but his words were perfectly clear . " Have you figured out what 's happening yet , Brand ? Have you figured out the answer to your question ? " " Shut up ! Shut up ! " shouted Grapple . " And what about the rest of you ? " Merrison continued . " Do you know what 's going to happen ? Can you feel if it 's started yet ? You 'll know when it does : it 'll feel like hot skewers in your limbs . " " If you do n't shut up , " said Grapple . " I 'm going to stave your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , " said Merrison . " I do n't think you 've got time . Got to get the cave all sealed before the change begins . " There was fury in my father 's eyes , and something else as well . Something that was furtive and guilty and terrified . He knows , I thought . I had n't a clue what was happening , but my father understood perfectly what Merrison was talking about . " I can save you , " said Merrison . He had given up on Grapple and was talking straight to me . " I can save you if you set me free . " The final stones were shifting into place . The air was full of the stink of duster meat . The shadows that the fire cast were twisted and deformed . " Last chance , " said Merrison . It was the shadows that did it . The way they moved . No human shadow ought to move like that . I flung myself across the floor and snatched the knife from his neck . What happened next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to remember , let alone describe . But there was one last thing I saw that surely needs to be told . One last thing that is the point of everything else . In the seconds before Merrison began to use the knife on my father , I saw the old man turn to face him . He still looked contorted , but the misshaping of his body no longer seemed like a weakness . His arms were extended in a fighting pose , and below them I could see something that had burst out of his chest , out of each side of his tunic . I knew what I was seeing . Although they were still thin and rather string-like , and the claws at their tips had not yet fully developed , there was really no mistaking them . They were a pair of knuckleduster legs . Then Merrison kicked the fire aside and there was nothing but darkness . AN INDETERMINATE TIME afterward , I felt something moving in the air in front of me . It was only when I felt the warmth of skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merrison and not the thing my father had turned into . Are you all right ? he signed . " Not really . " I spoke the words out loud . I could hear things moving on the other side of the rocks - dusters , lots of dusters - but I did n't care . " Are they all dead ? " I said . I was talking about my family , my friends . " I 'm afraid so . There was nothing I could do . Once the transformation has started , there does n't seem to be a way of stopping it . " " You knew this was going to happen ? " " Not for sure , not until the end . Until then , all I had were suspicions . Admittedly , they were quite strong suspicions . There were so many clues , you see . The way that people got more and more relaxed the longer they stayed in The Hollow . The way they never really tried to get out of the tunnels . I 'd seen this sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Yes . This is how the Illowain could have weapons that would last for thousands of years without the need for either fuel or maintenance . For most of the time there 's nothing down here at all , just rockfruit growing and rotting in the dark . Nothing happens until people find their way into the tunnels and eat the fruit . That 's what triggers the changes . Behavioral changes to make sure they keep eating , do n't try to leave too soon . And finally the physical changes that - well , you saw it for yourself . " It 's a very efficient system . The plants just lie there for centuries without doing anything at all . But when the time comes that you need to raise an army , all it takes is a lure to draw people into the tunnels . " " The Forizael-rush , " I said . All those people from all over the world , looking for wealth in the mines and never guessing what they might find in the tunnels far below . " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Theoretically , yes , but in practice it would probably just have been Grapple . He 'd been stealing all the rockfruit so the process was further advanced with him than for the rest of them . They 'd have turned into food before they got a chance to turn into anything else . " Somehow the idea that my father could be accused of theft and I could say nothing to defend him hurt more than anything else that day . It took me a while before I was ready to speak again . " What about the dusters outside ? Wo n't they try to get in ? " " If they wanted to , they could . Grapple 's barricade was never going to be a match for a bunch of hungry dusters . It was n't there to keep them out ; it was there to keep us in . The ones outside will only take an interest if we try to escape . This is a birthing pen ; that means it 's sacrosanct . Dusters fight each when they 're older , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had their first meal . " Their first meal , I thought . That would have been me if Merrison had n't saved me . I said : " You knew all this . You knew that this was going to happen , but you did nothing to stop it . " " What could I do ? If I had told you this before , would you have believed me ? " " I 'm not just talking about now . You said it yourself , people get lured underground . All your equipment , all your technology was making it easier to be lured , opening the mines up faster , letting more people be sucked into this trap . " He said : " The dew rush was happening anyway . At least our intervention helped some good come out of the business . " " What good ? " I said . " Thanks to our involvement , these mines have become a center for more technological change than this planet has seen in centuries . And what people learn here they will take home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have built here are the start of a process that will transform this world and one day take your people to the stars . " I thought about transformations . I thought that if I got up and moved around then it would n't be long before I put my hand in something that had been transformed . " Is that for our benefit ? " I said . " Or is it more about changing our world so it 'll be easier for you and your crew mates to get home ? " There was a long silence . Eventually Merrison said : " You 're angry . I can understand that . You think I 've treated you and your people badly . Maybe that 's true . But there 's more at stake here than the fate of your family or my crew mates or any of the people in the mines . The threat from the knuckledusters existed long before any of my people came to your world . The rockfruit was always here . Sooner or later you would have dug down into the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that process forward but at least this way you 'll have someone on your side who knows what you 're facing and has some experience dealing with it . " " Why does anyone have to deal with them ? " I said . " Why ca n't we just leave them down here ? " " Because they 're not just fruit anymore . They 've turned into dusters and they 're not going to stay down here . You said it yourself . This is not a viable ecology . The dusters can not live down here indefinitely . This is an army being built in the dark . Sooner or later they will climb up to the daylight . We have to get out and warn people before it happens . " I said : " Not much chance of our getting out with that lot roaming around . " " Whatever chance there is we must take it . And things may not be quite as bad as they seem . The dusters outside will want to get clear before the infant emerges . It cuts down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raft and make our way to the Night Rush . " " Good plan , " I said . " Just one problem with it . There is no raft . Grapple burned it . I saw a piece of it just before- " I broke off . I did n't want to finish that sentence . " He probably smashed it up just after they killed Buttress . " Merrison said : " There are bits of wood around . We could lash them into something . Hell , what else are we going to do before we die ? It wo n't be much of a raft ... " " ... but it 'll be better than nothing , " I said . And now it 's three days later and we stand at the edge of the Night Rush with our knocked-together raft lying on the ground in front of us . I think it 's probably just as well that it 's dark and we ca n't see how bad a job we 've done of lashing it together . The air is full of spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entering the water is altogether terrifying . " This is mad , " I say . " It 's a chance , " says Merrison . " In fact , it 's better than a chance . This is the way out . This is how we are going to get out . " I reach out and take his hand . In spite of everything that has happened , I know that he is right . Ready ? he asks me . I touch his face . I 'm ready . We wrap our arms around the rah in the way we have agreed and , without further hesitation , throw ourselves forward . The water is bitingly cold . I kick with my legs , tasting salt and ice . Then the current seizes and drags us headlong downward , drawing us into the darkness that lies between us and the day .
