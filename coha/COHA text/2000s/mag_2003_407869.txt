YOU AI N'T SEEN THE GRAND UNTIL YOU 'VE SEEN IT FROM ONE OF THESE LESS-TRAVELEDTRAILS. // So , you say you 've seen the Tetons ? Hiked the Teton Crest Trail and the PaintbrushCascade Canyons loop ? Plunged into the icy waters of Amphitheater Lake ? Maybe even climbed the Grand ? Been there , done that ? Look again . Sure , those are all great spots . But you really have n't peered into the soul of America 's archetypal mountain range until you 've gone past the calendar-cover spots into the corners that do n't even make the November page . The three hikes here will take you to a far-flung hideaway of the Tetons that 's closer to the Yellowstone boundary than it is to the Grand , across endless alpine terrain of rock and riotous wild-flowers , into the fave haunts of moose and elk , along a long-abandoned trail , and off trail . Chances are you wo n't run into other people out there . Now stop goin ' on about how you 've seen the Tetons and go see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owl Canyon 1 The best hikes require a little sweat equity before you see the reward , and this is no exception . But how 's this for a payoff ? This loop is arguably the wildest , most remote , wildlife-filled , scenery-rich experience in Grand Teton National Park . The 25-mile loop through Webb and Owl Canyons is reached by either taking a boat across Jackson Lake ( when there 's no wind ) or hiking in on the Glade Creek Trail from Reclamation Road ( adding 16 miles round-trip ) . The trails sometimes resemble game paths , the terrain is rough , and you 'll climb more than 3,000 feet from the lake to 9,840-foot Moose Basin Divide . You 'll see elk , bighorn , and bears-yes , black and grizzlies . There are wild creek crossings that will have you yelping as the chill water hits your knees and you push through to the other side . You 'll also wade thigh-deep through wildflower meadows . Plus , you can boast being one of the few visitors who ever sees Moose Basin , where fir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprawling alpine meadows . The steep hump to the divide culminates with a breathtaking view south to 12,605-foot Mt . Moran and north all the way to Yellowstone 's Pitchstone Plateau . For the 25-mile loop from the lakeshore , figure 3 to 4 days . Add 2 days if hiking in from Reclamation Road , outside the park 's north boundary . Death Canyon/ Avalanche Canyon Loop 2 Do n't try to sleep at the mouth of Death Canyon . It 's a favorite dining spot for moose , and you can expect a few clomping by your tent before dawn . But temporary insomnia will be your only complaint on this 23-mile loop . Incomparable mountain vistas , high alpine hiking , solitude , a blend of on-trail and off-trail exploration , and the joy of hiking the remnants of a trail abandoned half a century ago-if only all backpacking trips offered so much . From Death Canyon , you 'll turn up the Alaska Basin Trail and find yourself face-to-face with killer views of lake-speckled Alaska Basin and the daunting walls of Buck Mountain . Do n't miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divide . The 360-degree panorama of the Tetons and Jackson Hole are worth the effort . From the Alaska Basin Trail , keep an eye out for a faint path , the unmaintained Skyline Trail , which leads to a saddle at the south end of The Wall . At Avalanche Canyon , the soaring cliffs of the South Teton , Mt . Wister , and other peaks flank Snowdrift Lake and Lake Taminah . Lastly-call it a Grand finale-enjoy a killer view from Taggart Lake of the park 's namesake peak . Granite Canyon Loop 3 This hike offers all the beauty of the Garden of Eden minus the forbidden fruit and pesky serpent . The steady ascent from Death Canyon trailhead climbs past waterfalls and long , boulder-strewn cascades , which provide a visual appetizer for the green slopes , dark cliffs , and picturesque creek of Granite Canyon . Sheer cliffs rise hundreds of feet above the 9,000-foot-high plateau called Death Canyon Shelf , while spring-feel creeks tumble over its lip . The view toward the Grand and other peaks in the heart of the Tetons is among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Teton Crest Trail traverses a broad , mostly treeless 9,500-foot plateau where wildflowers bloom so profusely you 'll suspect someone tends them and tiny Marion Lake snuggles up against the cliffs of Housetop Mountain . Gawk at your own risk on the push through aptly named Granite Canyon . The stunning walls have a way of inflicting stiff necks on hikers passing below . Plan 3 to 4 days for the loop , which is about 26 miles if you descend the North Fork of Granite Canyon and 29 miles going down the Middle Fork .
