It turned out there was another mother at my son 's nursery school whose father had killed himself . I learned this when I came back to Boston , ten days after my father died . I dropped my son off at the school and watched as he darted off , quick as a released minnow , into the space that was so familiar to him . One of the teachers came over and asked how I was doing . <p> I nodded . <p> " You should talk to Kate , " she said . <p> I barely knew Kate . <p> " Look , " said the teacher . " I have n't told anyone what your father did . I just said he died . But if you want me to , I 'll tell Kate . Her father did the same thing . " <p> " Okay , " I said . <p> The next morning when I brought my son to school , Kate came up to me . " What are you doing right now ? " she asked . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my house . For some reason we decided to sit in the backyard . It was a warm day for February , but it was still February . We had mugs of tea , and we kept our gloved hands wrapped around them . I remember Kate blowing on hers , the steam rising in front of her cold face . She sat with her long legs up on the table . She was seven months pregnant , wearing overalls and a red down jacket . <p> She asked me what my father had done , and listened while I told her . <p> " Mine used a gun , too , " she said , " but other than that it was pretty different . " <p> " Different how ? " I asked . <p> " First of all , he kept threatening to do it . For years . He had this whole big Hemingway thing going on . The drinking , the guns . He kept telling us he was going to shoot himself . We did n't believe him anymore . Nobody wanted to listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel guilty , then , when he did it ? " <p> " No , " Kate said . Her voice was cool ; she made it sound convincing . " I was n't relieved , either . Just : Okay , yup , now I know the ending . " <p> She told me that her father had been staying alone in their house in Florida . " My brother and I flew down that night , as soon as we heard . He was n't there anymore . They 'd taken him away . " <p> Her cool , soft voice got even quieter . " The room was a mess . He would have liked that , it would have pleased him , knowing what a mess he 'd made . My brother and I cleaned it ourselves . I guess we could n't figure out how else to get it done . I picked this big thing off the floor , and I did n't know what it was . Then I turned it around , and I realized it was his jawbone . " <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , years ago at a cocktail party , sent me a note in shaky handwriting , from the nursing home where she lived now . <p> " I know how you feel , " the note said . " I remember what it was like for me , when my father did what yours did . " <p> I told my mother these stories . She shook her head . " They keep crawling out of the woodwork , " she said . <p> She had an old friend named Gloria , who was so beautiful that my father had nicknamed her " Glorious . " That 's what our family had called her for the past thirty years . <p> Glorious had come to visit my mother some time after my father died . They 'd sat up late , talking , not about anything much , according to my mother . <p> Then , out of nowhere , Glorious had suddenly said that her mother had committed suicide . She 'd been in and out of institutions for years , Glorious said . She was a beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " And she shot herself in the face , in front of my father . In their bedroom-she 'd kept the gun in her glove box . A tiny pistol . He did n't even know she had it . " <p> My mother had been stunned . " All these years we 've been friends , and you 've never told me this . " <p> " I 've never told anyone , " Glorious said . Then she leaned forward and took hold of my mother 's wrist . " Promise me you wo n't tell . I do n't want Dan to know about this . " <p> Dan was Glorious 's son . He was forty . <p> At prep school , my husband had been close to a boy named Thad . Thad 's mother died during their tenth-grade year from an overdose of pills and alcohol . Thad had been furious at his father , who kept insisting that the death was accidental , and who married his secretary seven months later . My husband spent hours listening to Thad talk about how miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary ) , how desperately sad , how lonely . <p> After my father died , my husband called Thad . They 'd kept in touch over the years , but sporadically , not in any deep way . My husband told Thad what my father had done , and said , " I need to talk to someone who 's been through this . And I 'm remembering what it was like for you , some of the things you were feeling , after your mother 's suicide . " <p> There was a silence on the other end of the line . Then Thad said , " I 'm not sure what it is you 're remembering , but my mother 's death was an accident . " <p> One of the men I worked with was married to a woman named Jane . They invited us to dinner one night , and when everyone was settled with drinks in the living room and Jane disappeared into the kitchen , I followed and asked her if I could help . <p> She smiled at me-thanks-and then the smile dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , but Rob told me about your father . " <p> " I do n't mind , " I said . <p> " It 's hard , " Jane said . <p> She put down the salad spoons and sat on a stool , and motioned me to sit down , too . She said , " My sister did it when she was on the phone with me . She told me what she wanted to do , and I spent about forty-five minutes trying to talk her out of it . I kept trying to think of a way to call someone else to go to her house , to just get there , but I also wanted to keep her talking . Finally she put down the phone , but she did n't hang up . She cut her throat . I could hear- " <p> Jane and I looked at each other . <p> Then Jane said , " I do n't think she was trying to torture me . I think maybe she was afraid , and she did n't want to be alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd been to her Christmas party , she 'd been to my house for dinner a couple of times . Then her brother cut his wrists and jumped from the roof of his apartment building . <p> When Claire reappeared a few weeks later , I asked if she wanted to get together . Yes , she said . I brought her sandwiches . We sat in her kitchen . She told me that the saddest thing was the stacks of Help Wanted sections in her brother 's apartment , so many ads neatly circled in red magic marker . <p> " He was so smart , " she told me . " You should have seen his bookshelves-history , political theory , economics , musicology , anthropology . He was one of those people who could have done anything , but nothing ever quite worked out . And then all those careful red circles : Copyeditor . Public relations assistant . Hotel management training . He had a Ph.D . in astronomy . " <p> She said , " I hope you do n't mind if I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a lot of blood in the room , when my father died . I told her that I did n't think so . The gun had malfunctioned , so that even though he 'd put it into his mouth and it had killed him , there had just been a little bit of blood on the baseboard . My husband cleaned it up late that night . He told me it had just been a small amount , and I believed him . <p> I told Claire that I 'd been the one to ask my husband to clean it , but afterwards I was sorry . " Or not sorry , exactly , " I said . " I do n't know what it was . But I kept going into that room . Not just that week , but for months after that , years . I still go in there . And I kneel , and I look at the woodwork . Like I just want there to be some trace of him , or of this thing that happened . " <p> She said that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had stayed away from her brother 's apartment for weeks , because she was afraid of seeing the blood . But then when she finally went there , and saw that there was n't any blood , she was disappointed . <p> I went to visit a friend who was teaching English at a small college in upstate New York . She told me that a man in her department , a writer who had been there on a one-year fellowship , had hanged himself the month before . <p> That night we went to a department picnic , and she pointed out the man 's wife to me . I watched her for a while , from a distance . She was a little younger than I was , maybe in her late twenties , pretty , with long black hair . She was standing alone , with her arms crossed . I went over and introduced myself . Then I blurted out-quietly , but it was still a blurt-that I was sorry to hear about her husband and that my father had killed himself , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appalled at what I 'd said to her . I started to apologize , but she said sharply , " No . No . Tell me . Did you have any idea ? Did you know he was going to do it ? " <p> I shook my head . " I 'm not sure he even knew he was going to do it . And he certainly would n't have given any warning . He was a very gentle , considerate man- " <p> " That 's just like Johnny ! " she said . " That 's just how he was . He never told anyone he was unhappy-everyone else came to him with their problems . " Her face was white , pinched , excited . Her thin fingers were opening and closing like bird claws . <p> The outing was being held on an asphalt basketball court . We moved over and stood next to the chain-link fence . We talked for a while about these exceptionally kind men . How they could be so accepting of other people , and so secretly intolerant of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How they were like radiators that lack the little valves to let the steam off , and it just builds and builds and eventually explodes . How they could n't see that there was n't a lot of territory between keeping everything private , and dying . It got dark while we were standing there . <p> She turned to face the fence , and threaded her fingers through the metal links . " It 's so weird for me here , " she said . " I 'm only here for the rest of the year , and then I have to figure out what to do next . I only came here because of Johnny 's fellowship . " <p> She said , " I 'm so glad you came over to talk to me . None of them talk to me . " She jerked her head sideways , at the milling-around people from the English department . " Not that they ever did , before . Then I was just Johnny 's wife . " <p> She flashed me a smile , a mix of irony and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to say to me . " <p> My friend Claire went to a wedding in Australia , where she stayed in a guest cottage with three other women . One night they sat up late talking , and they found that all four of them had brothers who 'd committed suicide . <p> We find each other . We 're referred by friends . Or we happen to sit next to each other on an airplane . We end up standing together in a hallway , during a party . We stop noticing who is coming and going around us . We talk . It 's urgent . We have nothing new to tell each other . Even when the stories are different , they 're the same . <p> A friend 's sister dies : pills . The friend disappears ; she 's gone home , to be with her parents . <p> I drive by her house and leave a note . " Call me , " I write , and I give her my love . I leave the note in the space between the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am thinking that a day ago my friend did n't know any of this ; now she will never not know it . I 'm sorry for the freshness of her knowledge . I 'm sorry that she 's just at the beginning of it . <p> I 'm thinking about all the things that have happened , or that will happen but have n't yet . All the things that are teeming , unseen , behind the walls of all these houses . <p> Author Affiliation
