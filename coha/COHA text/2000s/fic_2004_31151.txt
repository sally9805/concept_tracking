Chapter One I walked twenty-two blocks to find a can of Fix-A-Flat in Brooklyn . Anywhere else in North America , the stuff is kept several cans deep on the store shelves , but not in New York City . At last , in a narrow-aisled bodega , I found a single can , hidden behind a basket of paraffin-coated yucca roots . There were three red price stickers on the cap , stacked carefully so that only the top price could be seen . I got " on line " behind a white-haired woman in a black tunic . There was Latin music playing from a radio . The woman bent over at the counter , scratching at something , then straightened and began to scream in short bursts , like this : " Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! " The man at the register took a step back and lifted a golf club over his shoulder . " What is she screaming for ? " " I 've just won ten thousand dollars ! " the woman said . She moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a New York Lottery scratch-off card pinned to the counter with both thumbs . " You did what ? Let me see , " the man said . He lowered his club , and she turned the card around so he could read it right-side up . " No , no . You won a hundred . There 's a decimal in there . " " A hundred ? You 're nuts , " she said . " Get your glasses on . " He carefully slid on a pair of reading glasses , thenbent over and peered at the card again . " Holy mother ! You did win ten thousand ! Aaaaahhh ! " " I told you ! Aaah ! Aaah ! Aaaaaaahhh ! " New Yorkers are an excitable breed , but they 're quick to settle down again . After a small crowd had gathered and dispersed , things went back to the New York version of normal . The woman tucked the winning card into her wallet and asked the man for a carton of Marlboro Lights and a bottle of Poland water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings on the sidewalk asked her to buy him a carton , too . She said she would buy him one pack , and a sandwich if he was hungry . " I 'm not hungry , " he said . She bought him a pack of Winstons and left . I paid for my Fix-A-Flat . After six disappointing months in the city , this simple can of leak-sealing , tire-inflating foam was my ticket out . I walked the twenty-two blocks to where my yellow Plymouth Duster sat listing at the curb . By the time I got there , I had shaken the can quite thoroughly per the instructions . I attached the tube to the left rear tire valve and released the foam , and the tire inflated . I got on my way . I was twenty-eight years old . The historian Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr . had won a Pulitzer by this age . The thought depressed me , and I reminded myself that Professor Schlesinger had the benefit of some early advantages that I lacked , in addition to his no doubt considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can with the tools we are given . By this same age of twenty-eight , Andrew Johnson had advanced himself from tailor 's apprentice to elected representative in the Tennessee General Assembly . Unlike Schlesinger , the future seventeenth president had no Exeter or Harvard behind him . He 'd been taught to write by his teenage bride . I left the city with my windows down , crossing the Verrazano Narrows Bridge , then Staten Island . The Duster could not maintain highway speed with its air conditioner running . I followed U.S. 1 through New Jersey and Pennsylvania , then into Maryland . In Baltimore I spotted a medium-sized fowl bird with an eighteen-inch tail sprinting frantically along the gutter of Belair Road . Traffic was heavy , and the bird , whose head was green with scarlet patches , was badly out of place . I later confirmed it to have been a male ring-necked pheasant . Farther south , in the District of Columbia , I spent an hour outside the Smithsonian Institution 's Arts and Industries Building eating two peanut butter sandwiches and trying to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of my presence in the nation 's capital . History is a difficult thing to imagine . Is it a line in which our lives form a tiny segment ? Or is it a massive live beast to whose hump we cling ? Andrew Johnson , I recalled , had in early days proposed converting the Smithsonian into a national trade school offering courses of study in carpentry , dentistry , and plumbing . What kind of man had thoughts like that ? Already the sights and strains of travel had fatigued me some . I 'd gotten a later start than I 'd meant to , due to some confusion with my landlady Mrs. Chouri over the security deposit . The sum was not an enormous one , but I had counted on it , especially in the light of certain inconveniences that I had quietly put up with during my six months ' tenancy in her building . For example , the shower in my apartment had no shower head . There was only a threaded neck protruding from a hole chipped out between tiles . Warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all hours , on the counter top with a spoon if my ears do not lie . I had n't complained . Then , that morning , as we walked through the apartment , Mrs. Chouri announced that my book crates had ruined her carpeting . " They have only made a very faint imprint , " I said . " Oh no ! They have seriously gouged the carpet , which affects the value of my building . " The facial absurdity of this proposition did not embarrass her . She clicked her mouth at me , bringing it closer and closer to my face , flicking her fingers at the same time in a characteristic way that she had . When she got so close that her breath moved my hair , I had to leave , deposit or not . Can a person so easily whipped as this look forward to any success in life ? I turned the question around in my mind as I sat by myself on the National Mall . I had a postcard on my knee and was attempting to pen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to say in so few words . Across the pavement , a man emerged from the Arts and Industries Building with a puffy Uncle Sam hat on his head . He stopped for a moment , perusing a brochure . The giant hat was made of satin , and it flopped to one side . The man slid the brochure into a trash barrel and wandered away . There are two kinds of historians : those who ascribe agency to vast impersonal forces , and those who give the credit and blame to individual humans . I hold the latter view , though I sometimes have to remind myself of it . I did this now . For a change , I had a plan , and I also had an advantage . Many had studied the scandal-torn presidency of Andrew Johnson ; some had the backing of universities and endowed foundations , but I had a secret lead all the others had overlooked . The lead concerned a set of Johnson papers that had been deliberately mislaid , and had stayed lost for over a century . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do was stay on task with an animal tenacity . Setbacks and reversals would come , but I would deal with them , drawing on my life 's experience and my bit of self-knowledge as needed . Step one had been leaving New York , the city where I developed a tic of excessive blinking . If for no other reason , I had to go away to rest my eyelids . Step two was Tennessee . I got back on the road . The Duster had been mine for one day . I had bought it from Mrs. Chouri 's nephew . When I stepped on the gas , a blue haze filled the rearview mirror . I had noted the smoky discharge on first inspecting the car , and when I mentioned it to Mrs. Chouri 's nephew he said , " What do you expect for under two thousand dollars ? " This throwing the comment back in your face is the New Yorker 's idiom . He assured me some smoking was normal for a car with ninety thousand miles on it . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of Washington , the yellow Duster started to hesitate . Women and girls scowled down at me from the passenger windows of tall SUVs . The Duster slowed to about fifty miles per hour , and I switched on the hazard lights . The miles and hours passed slowly , until just below Wytheville , Virginia , the right rear tire blew out . I steered the crippled vehicle to the side of the road and got out to look . The sun was behind some hills , and a cantaloupe-colored light washed over the roadside grass and gravel . I found a ragged hole in the side of the tire . I opened the trunk . The jack and spare were under all of my clothes , plus the entire University of Tennessee edition of the papers of Andrew Johnson , seventeen volumes counting the supplement . I had left the carpet-ruining crates in New York , having learned in the course of many moves that to pack a car truly full , the books must go in loose . I decided to wait for morning . I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult in the little crowded vehicle under the stars at the edge of the freeway with eighteen-wheelers hurtling past all night at an irregular frequency , shedding enormous violent air wakes that made the Duster shudder in place , and some of them blowing their loud horns . At length I dropped off into a fragmentary slumber and dreamed I was a passenger on one of those haunted-house carnival rides where arms and squeals and hatchets pop out from the darkness , and you are strapped into your seat and can hear the wheels rattling underneath you on the tracks . Then , in my dream , I was with my father at the Hall of the Presidents at Disney World in Orlando , Florida . I was ten . A very rich and keen expectancy lay upon us as the auditorium lights dimmed and the curtain rose on a life-sized tableau of the thirty-nine American presidents . My father pointed out the current one , Ronald Reagan , towards the front in a brown suit , alongside Abraham Lincoln and the seated General Washington . I searched the back rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard Taft , and the sideburn-wearing Chester Arthur , and the hollow-cheeked John Tyler . I knew all of their faces well , having studied them daily at school . Their printed portraits were taped up in a row above the chalkboard in our classroom . My father clutched at my arm , and the shiny-haired Reagan spoke : " I welcome you to the Hall of the Presidents , where the chief executives of our nation have gathered to share with you the story of our America . " The president 's head turned smoothly a few degrees and stopped . His spotlight faded as another one rose on Teddy Roosevelt , who had a look on his face like he was being pinched by devils . His jaw chopped open and shut when he talked . The dozen or so major presidents spoke in turn , each pivoting his head in some way or lifting an arm to emphasize a point . Woodrow Wilson was eulogizing the League of Nations when my father and I noticed a low , monotonous sound . It seemed at first like something mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - but then a rhythm of muffled speech emerged . Wilson stopped in mid-sentence , his head twisting quizzically . " Deem me not vain or arrogant , " the muffled voice said ; " yet I should be less than man if under such circumstances I were not proud of being an American citizen , for today one who claims no high descent , one who comes from the ranks of the people , stands , by the choice of a free constituency , in the second place in the government . " " What in the hell is that noise ? " Teddy Roosevelt said . " There may be those to whom such things are not pleasing , but those who have labored for the consummation of a free Government will appreciate and cherish institutions which exclude none however obscure his origin from places of trust and distinction , " the voice went on . " It 's Johnson , " Woodrow Wilson said . " It ai n't me , " Lyndon Baines Johnson replied . " No . It 's Andrew Johnson , " Wilson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " " Speak not over your interlocutor , nor weary him with tedious iterations , " General Washington said from his chair down in front . " You , Senators , you who constitute the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States , are but the creatures of the American people ; your exaltation is from them ; the power of this Government consists in its nearness and approximation to the great mass of the people . You , Mr. Secretary Seward , Mr. Secretary Stanton , the Secretary of the Navy .... " " I can not make out the man 's words ! " Franklin Delano Roosevelt exclaimed shrilly . He and Washington were the only seated presidents . " His speech is slurred ! " " The man has been drinking , " Lyndon Johnson said . " He 's shit-faced ! " " His jaw has no hinge , " Thomas Jefferson explained . Jefferson was correct . A spotlight found Andrew Johnson 's place high on the back row of presidents and lit up his powdery white face and the obdurate blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had limbs and a head that were nonmotorized . His jaw was immobile , and he spoke through what appeared to be a narrow slit between his pale wax lips . " Humble as I am , plebeian as I may be deemed , permit me in the presence of this brilliant assemblage to enunciate the truth that courts and cabinets , the President and his advisors , derive their power and their greatness from the people . Such an assertion of the great principles of this Government may be considered out of place , and I will not consume the time of these intelligent and enlightened persons much longer ; but I could not be insensible to these great truths when I , a plebeian , elected by the people the Vice President of these United States , am here to enter upon the discharge of my duties . " " Can it , " Lyndon Johnson said . " How 'd he get drunk when his jaw wo n't hinge ? " Harry Truman said . " I welcome you to the Hall of the Presidents , " Ronald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I , though a plebeian boy , am authorized by the principles of the Government under which I live to feel proudly conscious that I am a man , and grave dignitaries are but men . " But then abruptly he stopped speaking , and his short , rigid frame fell forwards into the aisle with a soft crash . He was quiet . " Thank you , Christ , " Lyndon Johnson said . " Andy has learned his lesson , " Lincoln added . My father , who was still squeezing my arm , said , " That was not at all what I expected , son . " I woke up to find the Duster 's windows fogged and myself encased in a clammy sweat . ( Continues ... )
