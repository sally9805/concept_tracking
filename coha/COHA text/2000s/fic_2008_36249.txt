PROLOGUE <p> The first murders were committed nineteen years before the second , on a dry and unremarkable day along the Sutlej Frontier in Punjab . <p> It was beastly hot weather , as Juniper remarked to Captain Lysander out on the veranda of the officers ' mess , fit for little more than an odd gin and tonic , perhaps the lazy composition of a letter home . The flies , maddening creatures that had never learned to take no for an answer , crowded around the nets that blocked the porch , searching for a way in . " I would trade a hand to be back in London , " Lysander said to Juniper after a long pause . " At least they have the decency to bar these flies from coming into the city there . " <p> The battalion was on edge , because a recent retaliatory raid on a local village had turned bloody . Suspicion and rumor abounded . The officers , with a few exceptions , had long ceased to attend to their charges ' morale . Though all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves , every one of them at that uneasy moment would have made the trade Lysander proposed . <p> " Well , " said Juniper . " I may go look around and have a bit of a shoot with Jim . " <p> " Were you planning that ? " <p> " Oh , yes . " <p> " Where do you reckon you 'll go ? " <p> " That little patch of scrub east of here . Doubt we 'll find anything worth a bullet . Maybe a darkie or two , looking for trouble . " <p> Lysander smiled grimly . " Past that little grove of banyan trees , then ? " <p> " Curious today , are n't you ? " <p> In another place this might have sounded rude , but being white was a great equalizer in that country , and these men were too intimate to maintain entirely the ceremonies of respect and rank that defined the British . <p> " Always on the lookout for a decent bit of shooting , you know , " responded Lysander , sipping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , savvy-looking man . " D' you know why they give us so much tonic , young pup ? " <p> " No . Why ? " <p> " Has quinine in it . Prevents malaria . " <p> " I suppose I did know that , actually . " <p> " They must 've told you in training . " <p> " Yes , " said Juniper , nodding agreeably . <p> " Just past that grove of banyan trees , then ? " There was a slight , casual persistence in Lysander 's voice . " Ever shot anything edible there ? " <p> " Not to speak of . There are a few birds , not much on the ground . It 's poor sport . " <p> " So 's this whole country . " <p> " Any more inspirational speech before I leave ? " <p> " On your way . " <p> Juniper stood up . " I 'm sure I 'll see you for cocktails . " <p> But he would n't , and the other man knew it . <p> When Juniper had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and walked briskly up a small dirt path that led from the mess to his villa . The captain 's batman , his assistant and a lance corporal , was on the porch , whittling an Indian charm to send back to his mother . He had been working on it for weeks . <p> " Best go do it now , " Lysander said . " He 's off with Juniper . Both of them , would you ? They 're hunting , out east , in that scrub . " <p> " Yes , sir , " said the batman , standing . Here rank still meant something . <p> " Do your best to make it look like an accident , obviously . " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> Lysander paused . " By the way , that treasure ? " <p> " Yes , sir ? " <p> " There 's talk of a society . Do n't know what it 's to be called yet , and it will be for officers alone . " <p> " Sir ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do right by you . " <p> " Thank you , sir . " <p> The batman ran off , and Lysander called to one of the servants , a fair Indian lad , swathed in brilliant pink and pale blue that contrasted with the dull beige of the landscape and the military man 's uniform . The boy with some sullenness came forward . <p> " That box , " Lysander barked . " Bring it to me . And it 's worth your life to open it before it gets here . " <p> A moment later he was holding the box , and , when certain he was alone , he opened it to reveal a massive , pristine , and beautiful sapphire . <p> As he snapped the box shut and had it taken away , Juniper and his friend Jim emerged from the latter 's house , guns broken over their arms , both wearing beige , broad-brimmed hats to keep the dying sun off of their necks and faces . They had a bantering style of conversation that sounded as if it had been picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear how much closer they were than Juniper and Lysander . <p> " A farthing says you 'll never eat what you shoot , " Juniper said with a laugh . <p> " A farthing ? I 've played higher stakes than that with women . " <p> " That serving girl of mine you like , then . " <p> " What do I have to eat ? " <p> " First thing either of us shoots . " <p> " What if it 's the dirt ? " <p> " Bet 's a bet . " <p> " How much dirt would I have to eat ? " <p> " Nice haunch of it . " <p> " Farthing for the first meat , let 's go back to that . Do n't shoot anything too horrible . " <p> " I 'm insulted you 'd suggest it . " <p> It was a little more than a mile outside of camp , away from Lahore  --  and that city 's dangers , which these two men knew all too well  --  that they found a decent patch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it . They did n't have a dog , but Juniper shot into the undergrowth and drove a few birds out into the open , where the two men had a clear look at them . <p> They observed the birds fluttering , partially obscured , soon to be dead . Ruminatively , Juniper said , " What do you miss most ? About England ? " <p> His interlocutor thought it over . " I wish I had n't left it so badly with my family , you know . I miss them . " <p> " I do , too . " <p> " Only six months , I suppose . " <p> Then both men heard a scratching emerge from the under-growth that lay off to their side . <p> A shot . The fall of a body . Another shot . The fall of a body . A lone figure , Lysander 's batman , rose from his hidden spot and ran off full bore back west . And then a long , long silence , in the empty land that stretched blank as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred miles away from Piccadilly Circus . <p> Excerpted from The September Society by Charles Finch <p> Copyright 2008 by Charles Finch <p> Published in 2008 by St. Martin
