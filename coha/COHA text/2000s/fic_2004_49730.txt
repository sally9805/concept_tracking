IF HE HAD NOT BEEN FORCED TO SCROUNGE through the Depression , Henry Sotile might have been the founding genius , the Rockefeller , of quick-stop shopping . As a matter of fact , in his old age he was a ringer for old John D. He looked like a dessicated insect . Although he seemed old to me when I was a child , he was likely not yet fifty in the decade that I remember him best , the 1940s . <p> By then the store had become his cranium , and its inventory preempted the contents of his mind and occupied all its shelves . Further , he was the store in the public mind . Not one of us could think of him aside from his little grocery market . He was a walking five-and-dime , seven days a week ( eleven to five on Sundays ) . <p> If he slept , it would be from absolute exhaustion and depletion of the nerves , the last system to shut down at night and the first to fire up each morning . <p> Difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do just that for the sake of accurately depicting his day . To escape the charge of uncommon cruelty ( but acknowledging the cruelty common to writers ) , we will select at random , like picking an orange from a pyramid of oranges , the day Monday , August 7 , 1944 . <p> It is 5 A.M. The same netting that covers his vegetables also protects him and Miss Mina from mosquito marauders . A few more ticks ; now it is 5:07 A.M. and Henry has already overslept . However , Miss Mina , next to him , is stirring out of her rich dreams . She wo n't let him rise too late . <p> Softly , she says , " Henry ! " Even Mina 's exclamations are soft . Henry , inert as a grasshopper caught in spider-webbing , does n't move . She kisses his dry lips with all her juicy heart in the kiss . He jerks spasmodically . His eyes bulge open and his forearms fly out to grasp her in a hard embrace and he gradually warms to life as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibers of her being . <p> " It 's twelve o'clock over there , " she says . " Sunny 's about to go to the mess hall . " The couple often marked their own hour at home in Louisiana and used it to track Henry Jr . ' s activities in London time . They called him Sunny . <p> Yes , Henry 's meager invertebrate juices and Mina 's richly red organs that pumped and flowed day and night had once upon a time come together and factored , factoried , manufactured , a golden child . <p> " Yes-yes , " Henry answers in staccato , and squeezes her tighter . " I miss him . I wonder what he 's eating over there . From a little kid he 's always loved your red beans and rice . No red beans and rice over there . No-no-no sirree . " <p> Releasing Miss Mina , Henry leaps from the webbed bed and bounds into the bathroom . He had shaved the night before , laid out his khaki pants with the patched pockets and the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to comb his stiff , short , gray crew cut . <p> His limp shirt hangs on the chair . Under the chair his tennis shoes are poised in their starting blocks . They are black canvas high-top shoes with white rubber caps where the ankle bones would be on the feet . Yesterday 's socks are tucked into them . " He does everything but pee the night before , " thinks Mina as she looks over his laid-out clothes in the shafted light from the bathroom . It was Monday and he would bathe tonight . <p> Townspeople were amused by the day-in-and-day-out sameness of Henry 's attire , the tennis shoes , particularly . This reaction must be glossed for the younger reader whose experience of tennis shoes is that they are ubiquitous . They were not ubiquitous in the 1940s ; they were strictly gym shoes . Everyone wore leather dress or semidress shoes then . Tennis-shoe wearers were some kind of eccentrics . <p> Anyway , by first light Henry has already hopped down the three wooden steps into the store ( it is attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting the netting from the drowsy vegetables . It is two hours before opening time . He checks his fly on the fly . This is a tic he has . Moments later he checks it again . <p> I might have been waiting for him to open that morning . I certainly could have been there for something my mother needed in a hurry . I was there almost every day . Mrs. Melancon was probably there , too , waiting to play the slots , money on the hoof for Henry Sotile in the shape of an old woman with a gambling addiction and an apron pocket full of change . Even more serendipitous for Henry , to attempt to cover her habit , she would buy something two or three times a day-a comb , or a banana , or a pack of cigarettes-before sidling up to one of the two machines . Or rather , to the one machine she favored , a rainbow bandit that beckoned her with his one silver arm terminating in a big round red knob like a prosthesis . She was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging from its lips . <p> Mrs. Vaucoudrais 's cook was probably waiting , too , for the store to open . In the older part of town , where Sotile 's store nestled on a side street between rich and poor , many residences were morphing into offices , clinics , gas stations , if they were not being razed for parking lots . There were no chains of convenience stores then , and Sotile 's survived thanks to drop-in customers and a single fabulously rich patron , Mrs. Harvey Vaucoudrais , who lived half a block away . Mrs. Vaucoudrais ordered from the largest grocer in town , Kinberger 's , for her legendary dinner parties and soirees , but her cook made daily , even thrice-daily , jaunts to Sotile 's for the mundane pop-up necessities of the great house . " I 'm got to go to Sotile-sto , " she would inform her employer , and she would be off for a welcome break to exchange gossip at the tiny market with her friends . The Vaucoudrais cook , like the Sotiles , had a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where he served , but none of the black ones . <p> Henry would have laid down his cloak for Mrs. Vaucoudrais to walk on , everyone said . But of course , she never set foot in the place . Henry had to make do with bowing and scraping to the cook . He would leave a white customer hanging or delegated to Miss Mina , in order to scrabble over to the cook whenever she came in . This amused some whites , made others angry . <p> My nose twitches and itches as I recall his scurrying up to me , after the cook left , out of the gloom of the back of the store . Whenever he came up , it would descend over my face like an anesthesiologist 's mask : his smell . The acridity of it stung directly to my innermost nasal passages . I must explain . It was not foul like feces or urine-it was only old sweat , ancient sweat , sighing from that limp oyster-gray shirt that had not been white since it was lifted from the mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you advanced further into the store , his sweat , spirare nervosa , mingled with the odors of bananas turning winey . Then garlic , onions , shallots . Then cheap dry goods that reeked of chemicals . It was something you accepted . Sweat had not yet been demonized by Madison Avenue . <p> He turned abruptly away from me that morning ( or perhaps another day when I was there-why ca n't I remember ? ) to a more important customer . He whipped out his pocket knife and placed an orange on his meat block . He surgically sectioned the orange into eight parts , offered a wedge to her on the knife-edge . " Try that . Heh-heh . " He hoarded even his laughter . No need to waste energy when a little heh would do you as good as a horselaugh . " New shipment of oranges . Taste that . Sweetest oranges anywhere . They come from Spain in the off-season . Delicious , heh ? Wo n't have any more like these till winter . From Florida . This is your last chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> If he , on rare occasion , did not have what you wanted in stock , he always had a substitute under your nose before you could catch your breath . His speech was a wonder . I have never heard anyone else talk so fast except on the vaudeville stage . " No , ma'am , **96;1796;TOOLONG **26;1894;TOOLONG as can be-look at that orange color-fresh-green-tops . " If Madame pointed out that French fried carrots would not quite cut it , he would call Miss Mina over ( who indeed was a marvelous cook ) to give her a recipe for them . " Oh yes they 're mighty tasty that way , you can even put ketchup on ' em , heh-heh , need some ketchup ? I have a closeout on these bottles here on the table , new tomato crop 's in now . These are closeout prices you wo n't find a better bargain anywhere in town-Sonny , close that screen door close it tight , lets the flies in-No ! Do n't bang it ! " And he would rush off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flies , or both . <p> Miss Mina would take over the customer with her two phrases ( she seemed to have but two phrases to her public vocabulary ) : " Sure ' nuff ? " and " I declare . . . " <p> And Mrs. Melancon 's relentless arm would pull the lever , bringing up ever-altering combinations of cherries , bananas , and oranges . Sometimes she banged her chrome adversary with the heel of her hand . " What goes around , comes around , you big garou , " she would mutter savagely . <p> Meanwhile , the boy and I would have to wait . We could only look around the miserable little store . <p> It had no floor . It had started as an outdoor market on the bare earth . Henry had later put walls around it and a roof over it , but foundation and flooring were beyond his capabilities and his means . Instead , he put down sheet linoleum . This was ages ago , when Henry Jr . was a toddler . Over the years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum under the pounding of feet . The surface was like hard cool rubber , but it rolled with the terrain underneath . The best way to experience this floor was in bare feet . My feet still remember it from my childhood . You had to watch your step , and signs all over the minuscule place admonished you to do this very thing . <p> The market had started out as an adjunct to their shotgun house that stood high on brick pillars . The store , though joined to the house at the hip , was nevertheless lower than the house , as it rose up directly from the ground . A side entrance led directly into a door cut into the house , after one climbed up several steps . This door was screened like the front door of the market . Its beat-up silver metal push bar said 7-Up . You LIKE IT . IT LIKES You . So , for Miss Mina , it was , step-step-step down into the store , step-step-step up into the house , down to the store , up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screen door screezing and slamming . I can still see her blue-veined shins under her cheap wash dress descending carefully to Henry 's impatient call . She was endlessly torn , like the sea , to the house , to the store , to the house . The house , up above , seemed always to be trying to raise the store to its level , and the store , down below , seemed to be trying to pull the house down into its dark depths . <p> For there was no natural light in the store . Somehow , windows were left out . The only natural light came from the front screen door . The rest was provided by bare lightbuibs strung from the ceiling , and knowing Henry , you already know that the bulbs were the lowest possible wattage commensurate with human vision . You had to be in the store several minutes before your pupils dilated sufficiently to allow you to see at all . <p> Henry himself never saw daylight except when he spasmodically swept the sidewalk outside his screen door . His popeyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even a crew cut seemed overdone on his shriveled skull . His sleeves would be rolled up just above knobby elbows . His white hairless arms were skinny as the broomstick he jabbed back and forth . <p> One phone served both the house and the store , and it was located in the house . Miss Mina wore out the steps going up into the hallway of the house , sprinting back and forth , back and forth , all day long , to answer the phone . When we were kids it was our thing to call Sotile 's store to inquire if they had Prince Albert in the can . Henry Sotile was our intended victim , but if Miss Mina answered in the affirmative , we nevertheless delighted in shouting , " Then you better let him out ! " Other days , we might inquire , " Are your eggs fresh ? Yes ? Better slap their faces . " <p> Or , " Is Armand there ? " <p> " No , wrong number . " <p> We would dial again . " Is Armand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Repeated one more time for pure spite , and then the kicker : dial the number a fourth and final time . <p> " Hello . This is Armand . Have there been any calls for me ? " <p> On the day I remember-it may or may not have been August 7-by the time Henry Sotile rushed up to wait on me , I had forgotten what my mother sent me for and had to go up into the house to phone her . When I came back , I could see Henry in the semidarkness , leaping around like a tweaked grasshopper , berating this kid . " Do n't tell me you were n't going to steal that orange ! You were headed out the door with it ! Your mama and papa never taught you any better ? **54;1922;TOOLONG " And he jooked the boy in the ribs . <p> The boy jerked and then stood there with his head down . <p> " Do n't you ever try anything like that again , " fumed Henry , his eyes bulging with hypertension behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sonny . " This embryonic Henry Ford , this aborted Horatio Alger , had a hair-trigger nervous system , the result of a lifetime of overreacting . <p> I picked up whatever it was my mother wanted and made haste to bring it to Miss Mina . I wanted out of there . She had to go to Henry for change . <p> His long black leather change purse was softer than suede from constant use . As a child , I could not formulate what it looked like . It looked like something obscene . He had no cash register . He pulled that black thing out of his khaki-pants pocket a hundred times a day to make change . Because of that coin purse , one always thought of him in terms of small change . Not paper money . Paper money was precious . Even a single , a one-dollar bill , was worth a lot in those days . Henry was a nickel-and-dime man . But he kept a lot of bills in his wallet , and he was thought to have a huge cache of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , he whipped a stubby feather duster from his back pocket and began to dust everything . At that moment the other thing he reminded me of , besides an insect , was a human squirrel with a feather duster for a tail . In a fit of frustration over the attempted theft , he even dusted the vegetables . Then he stuck the feather duster in its place in his back pocket . He adjusted and readjusted the vegetables as he always did , nervously hitching his khaki pants with little clawlike penny-stained hands , checking his fly , then thumb and forefinger adjusting his glasses precisely , with nervous little no-nonsense jerks . <p> Miss Mina took the orange from her husband and carried it up front . The boy crept toward the door , as did I. When we three got to the front door , Miss Mina slipped him an orange , not the orange , but another one from the other side of the pyramid . <p> " That orange was not yours to be taking , " she said , " but I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was too embarrassed to say anything , and bolted from the door . I stayed only long enough to hear Miss Mina call out , " I declare , it 's teatime in London , Henry . Sunny 's probably having tea and strumpets . " <p> " Yes-yes-yes . Yes . Mighty fine . Mighty fine . " He paused and peered out as if he had a glimpse of a distant lodestar . A mutation like joy briefly transformed his face before it stiffened again . Son . Sonny . Sunny Boy . <p> So passed the hours of August 7 between dusting and sweeping , fly-checking and checking for flies . <p> Given his patent mediocrity , why do my eyes tear up now when I write these words ? I suppose because he was mediocrity writ large , and cosmic mediocrity always impresses . And depresses . <p> But he had what you wanted . No doubt about it . It was hard to stump him . Condoms ? In the tiny drug section , under the counter . Kotex ( provided the aged condoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an intimate nature were referred to his wife for handling . Sotile 's constitution was not made for these transactions , for he could not openly brag on the product nor urge you to buy more of it . It was not seemly and tended to lose you customers because , in this case , it insinuated that you were always either having sex or menstruating . <p> Almond-stuffed manzanilla olives ? No problem . " Yes , ma'am , imported from Portugal , how many jars do you need ? " Imported from Portugal . By way of China , San Francisco , Canada , and a food broker 's overstock closeout warehouse in Hoboken , where they had sat for perhaps two years . <p> " - and a box of starch . Anything else ? I have some fresh greens today-turnip greens , mustard , collards-nice and fresh . That everything ? Come back . Say , tomorrow I 'm getting in some nice variety meats-salami , head cheese . . . " as you stumbled , mumbled , backed your way out of the screen door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he really like ? I wish I knew . Did he ever decorate for Christmas ? No , no , a thousand times no . Was he patriotic ? There was a white star on a blue background in their living-room window , indicating they had a son or daughter in the service . Miss Mina was so proud of that . Sunny was a bombardier ! Henry was proud of that , too , plus it was good for business . <p> Did he vote ? Doubtful . It would take time away from the store . What did he eat ? Very little , judging by his arthropodic frame . Did he smoke ? No , too expensive at twenty-one cents a pack , when you could get them . If he received a shipment of cigarettes , he saved them for special customers . Nervous as he was , smoking would have completely done him in . <p> He had to be a Catholic . Everyone with a French name was born Catholic . Did he go to church ? I do n't recall ever seeing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . " This and other proverbial statements were made about him . " So tight he has pockets in his underwear . " " Tight as Job 's hatband . " " So tight , he has the second dollar he ever made . ( He used the first to buy that pocketbook . ) " Over time , he himself became the metaphor , spawned the saying " Tight as Henry Sotile . " <p> He became synonymous with the penny ante , the pissant , the doodley-squat of our town , a figure of the absurd . He raised our own stature one notch all the way to the top , assured us that we were not jerks in a jerkwater town . <p> " His pitiable existence . " We pitied him even as we laughed . He could not rise to our more perceptive levels of thought . For example , he was incapable of comprehending the givens passed on by our military to us , that their son was not their son but a combatant ; that a group of sons was a unit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumscribed rounds , what could they know of war , and its ecstasy upon ecstasy of horror ? <p> I never knew who exactly was in the store that day at the moment the Word came down from Washington . As I said , perhaps I was there that day , although not at that moment of the day , because I 'm sure I would remember it . But it 's strange how childhood memory picks and chooses or does n't pick or choose . Only later in life did I recall that the Sotiles even had a son . <p> Mrs. Melancon said that when Miss Mina read the letter she raised her head and gave a cry like a she-wolf ( or some kind of primal cry ) , before she sank to the gummy floor of the store . <p> Mrs. Melancon claimed that she had hit three oranges on the day they got the word . The machine paid shower after shower of silver . Just as she thought it was over , she used to recount , the machine would hiccup and another sparkling shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That day must have remained , a mix of ecstasy and horror , in her memory . <p> Mrs. Vaucoudrais sent a very large spray when Henry Jr . ' s body was returned . How else could she react ? Really ? Henry and Mina were honored and not consoled by the flowers . What else could they be ? <p> After the death of his son , people began calling him Mr. Henry . They had always called Miss Mina Miss Mina . <p> I have often thought that when she recovered her sanity , Miss Mina must have been glad she had given the boy the orange that day . <p> Mr. Henry ? We encountered him again and again in his little store , looking the same except for something heart-stopping about him in the gloom , something that made us avert our glances , something aghast behind his eyes magnified to death by his lenses . <p>
