<p> " I 'm from Moldova , " proudly proclaims six-year-old Charlie Phillips . " I came on an airplane , my sister came on an airplane . Babies come on airplanes . " In Charlie 's world babies do indeed come from airplanes - because in his world most babies are adopted . As he grows , this fact will trigger many questions . But with lots of encouragement and exposure to children in similar situations , his mother Carol Blakenhorn hopes Charlie and his younger sister Syrena will never feel insecure about the fact that they were adopted . " It 's as important for me as it is for them to go to reunions , " says Ms. Blakenhorn . " They do n't see adoption as such an issue . They see other kids from Moldova , other kids who were adopted . It helps them feel special , but not different . " Families who have adopted children from overseas are making connections with others through play groups , potluck dinners , and reunions . While adoption agencies often have a mandate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it upon themselves to organize regular get-togethers as the kids grow up and issues of identity Adoptive families do n't have to go it alone begin to surface . Blakenhorn takes her children to as many events for adopted children as she can . She recently took them to a reunion of families who had adopted children from Moldova at Spence-Chapin , a private adoption agency in New York . There , in a room festooned with clusters of blue , yellow , and red balloons , young children and their parents had a chance to mingle . Such events provide a way for the families who traveled together to stay connected and for children to know they are not alone in their experience . This is important , says George Wu , director of the Gladney International Adoption Agency in New York , because " the return of parent and child to the United States is not the end of adoption - it is only the beginning . " After kids settle in , issues arise As the newness of the adoption wears off and families settle into life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of either the adoption agency or outside groups , these times can be especially challenging , particularly when children begin school and again when they enter the teen years . These are the years when questions of identity surface for any child , and the issue becomes more critical as adopted children grapple with questions of racial and cultural differences . Anticipating these questions , Mary Spaulding says she attends picnics and other such gatherings with her two children : Victoria , 5 , and Max , 3-1/2 , both of whom were adopted from Moldova . " It 's important for them to have a chance to hang out with other kids like them . It will be especially important for them as they approach the teen years when it is sometimes easier to talk to a peer rather than to a parent , " says Ms. Spaulding . Many of these children will struggle with not looking like their parents on the outside , and also with the fact that they are of two lands , languages , and cultures . They also question who they are in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and country . Jacey Norton and her husband , Joe , of Framingham , Mass. , started the Korean Adoption Circle to help families like themselves . The Nortons adopted two Korean children , and as they visited with other white adoptive parents , they realized that the children , who had rarely seen an Asian adult , were under the impression that they would grow up to be Caucasian . Norton decided it was time to introduce her children to role models in their own culture . She began taking them to a Korean church in the area , and the group she founded meets there regularly . Transcultural adoptions growing While international adoptions in the United States represent a small percentage of all adoptions , estimated at 100,000 to 120,000 a year , the numbers are rising . There were 16,396 such adoptions in 1999 compared with 7,093 in 1990 , according to the Joint Council on International Adoption Services . Russia was the leading source country , with 4,348 , followed by China , with 4,101 , and South Korea , with 2,008 , according to the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " transracial and transcultural adoptions are becoming the more conventional , nonconventional way to have a family , " says Ronnie Diamond , head of post adoption services at Spence-Chapin . Even so , many adoptive parents are not clear on how to raise their children . To assist parents , Spence runs a support program for children aged 7 to 13 . In these groups children can explore issues of teasing , isolation , and racism . The children are able to get validation from peers . " Parents must understand that they 're a multiracial or multicultural family now , " says Ms. Diamond . " Some feel the need to expose only the child to its birth tongue or culture . But really they should all learn together . Make it a family thing so the child is n't set apart , isolated . " Ideally , says Diamond , adoptive families should live in diverse neighborhoods , where the children have access to mentors from their culture , and can learn their birth language . While Spence-Chapin and the Gladney Institute offer extensive post-adoption programs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agencies . One such group is the New England Chapter of Families for Russian and Ukrainian Adoptions ( FRUA ) . There are 120 member families in New England and 2,000 in the United States . Families join seeking support , both educational and cultural . There are family events as well as adults-only conferences on such topics as dealing with the effects of institutionalization - which can affect the behavior of children who come from state-run orphanages . Nina Sullivan , 8 , has just begun to wrestle with what it means to be adopted , says her mother , Mary Sullivan , chairwoman of FRUA-New England . About a year ago , Nina began to express more curiosity about her " Life Book , " a photo album that tells her story of coming to America , says Ms. Sullivan , a single mother who adopted two children from the Ukraine : Nina and Julia , 3 . " It just began to click for her that she 's adopted , " says Sullivan . " This is the age when kids finally get it and understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tummy . In first grade she began to show a lot of sadness , about why are people poor ? Why ca n't people keep their kids ? She just got very aware of this loss in her life , and was low-level grieving . She also felt powerless . " To help Nina , the Sullivan family began sponsoring an eight-month-old boy in a Romanian orphanage . Even so , Sullivan expects these emotions will become stronger as Nina enters her teenage years . She anticipates that her daughter will experience a double dose of separation and abandonment issues . It is during the teen years that many adopted children want to find their birth parents . Although Sullivan is content to bring the Ukraine into her home through videos , fairy tales , and meals , other families feel the need to spend time with others in similar circumstances . Each year , for the past five years , the Avery family of Acton , Mass. , celebrates Chinese New Year with other families that traveled together to China to adopt . The Averys adopted two children , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around other kids whose stories are similar to their own is a very good thing , " says Susan Avery , a member of Families with Children from China , New England . " The kids came from the same orphanage and province . They learn they are not the only ones with this experience . Some of them grow close like sisters and brothers . " Mr. Wu of the Gladney agency says that in addition to reunions , parents must strive to teach children about their birth culture and language . " Parents must satisfy their children 's curiosity and not make them feel alienated , " Wu says . " But parents ca n't just make it adoption about the child . The parents need to take part in learning the culture and language as well because they have n't just adopted a baby , they have adopted a culture . " The Nortons in Framingham , Mass. , have taken that idea to heart . Both parents are learning Korean , and their answering machine 's outgoing message has a greeting in that language . Mrs. Norton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited the rest room in a Korean church . " Wow , " he told her , " they have restroom signs in Korean . " Norton says language is a powerful tool for immersing him in , and validating , his birth culture . The bottom line : being an American Some parents , however , say they worry about imposing a culture on their child , and prefer to let the child be the guide . " We all want our children to feel special and know about their roots but bringing in - almost imposing - their birth culture on them can burden them with separateness , " says Mary Spaulding . " My kids are American . I want them to know where they 're from , but I do n't want to hit them over the head with their culture either . " In the reunion hall at Spence-Chapin , two little boys , Christopher and Max , sat talking between mouthfuls of thickly frosted cake . Close by , the mother of one of the boys , Patrice Foley , looked on approvingly . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher , now 5 , and Alexandra , now 3 . " The reunions are important for our kids as well as us , " says Mrs. Foley . " We 're very close to one family we traveled with to Moldova . Christopher and Max sat on the airplane together coming home and have been friends since . " Christopher looked up and smiled , " We will always be friends . We came home together .
