Chapter Two Poppy Blake had been awake for some time , lying on her side facing the wall of windows . Anyone looking in would have thought she was watching dawn creep over the lake , because it was surely a breathtaking sight . Snow lay pristine over ice eighteen inches thick . Tall hemlocks and pines formed a shadowed skyscape on the islands that dotted the lake and the east shore beyond . As day arrived , a swath of brightening light climbed behind their limbs , allowing for the weakest , most delicate shards of pale yellow light to filter through . During any other season , with maples , beeches , and birch in leaf , the light would have been blocked . In winter , though , when sun was most needed , it positively twinkled . Poppy saw none of it . Her mind was miles away , in a dream place where one could erase mistakes of the past and start fresh . In that place , she was n't lying in bed alone . Nor was her house on one level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead with equipment necessary to keep her upper body strong and her lower from atrophy . Nor , in her dream place , was there a wheelchair by the bed . Poppy 's legs did n't work . They had n't since a snowmobile accident twelve years before . In those twelve years , she had learned everything there was to know about life as a paraplegic  --  the most important lesson being that she could n't turn back the clock and undo things . Only by accepting them could she lead a satisfying life . Still , there were times when she dreamed . This morning the fantasy involved a man she had seen only a handful of times . He was five foot ten , had red hair , blue eyes , and a sexy baritone that she had heard many more times than she 'd seen the man in the flesh . He called her regularly  --  or used to , until she put him off one time too many . But what choice did she have ? She could n't keep up with him from a wheelchair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't called in a month . The phone on her bed stand rang now  --  a single line , far removed from the complex system in the other room that Poppy used for business . She ran a telephone answering service for Lake Henry and the neighboring towns , and sat for much of the day before a large bank of buttons , directing calls from one place to the next , taking messages for the townsfolk , chatting with callers , passing on information . The phone on the bed stand was her personal line , and while family and friends frequently used it , they never called this early . It was barely seven in the morning . That was cause for alarm . In the seconds that it took to push pillows aside , turn herself over , and reach the receiver , she had horrid visions of her mother being ill . But the number illuminated on the handset was n't from Florida , where Maida was spending January , February , and March . It was a local number . Heather 's . " Hey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering why her friend would be calling so early when they 'd been together just the night before . But Heather was n't on the other end . The voice was urgent and deep . " It 's Micah . There 's trouble . " His next words blurred  --  made no sense to her at all  --  until he said , " I need someone to get the girls to school . Can you do it ? I 'm worried about Star . " Poppy pictured the little girl with long , silky hair framing pale skin and deep-set dark eyes . She loved both of Micah 's girls , but Star had always been the one to tug at her heart . " Of course I can do it , " she told him , confused , " but Heather is n't someone else . What are you talking about ? " " I 'm not talking about anything . It 's the FBI that 's saying it . " " Killed someone ? I do n't think so . We 've been friends since she first came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she could n't have been more selfless or giving or understanding . Or comforting or helpful . Heather could n't kill anyone if she tried . " " That 's what I said , but I do n't count . I 'll be there in five minutes , okay ? " " I 'll be at the door . " And she was . Poppy was a minimalist . She did n't bother with fancy clothes or makeup , rarely had , even before the accident . Rebels did n't primp and preen as their mothers might have them do . At the time , defying Maida in that way had given her great joy . Now , it was n't rebellion that kept her from fussing , but pragmatism . A quick trip to the bathroom , where everything was perfectly situated for wheelchair access , and a cursory washing up was all she allowed herself this morning . What time she spent was in layering up her legs and pulling on sheepskin boots , so that her feet did n't chill without her knowing it . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pixie-short hair with her fingers as she watched the headlights of Micah 's truck approach . The road was narrow but paved , the latter being one of the concessions that Poppy had made when , soon after the accident , her parents had carved off a wedge of their own land to build her a house . She had put her foot down on having a direct link to their place , needing what small semblance of independence she could retain , and had opted instead for the longer road out to the street . Paving it meant less of a risk in foul weather . Indeed , the most recent snow , fallen three days before , had been plowed aside , leaving patches of bare pavement that had been neatly sanded . This morning even those patches wore a sheen of ice . The ramp from the porch was built with the most shallow of declines , and even then , it had heat coils underneath that enabled Poppy to glide down without fear of skidding . Doing that now , she was at the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant . He was tall and solid , hatless as he often was , though his dark hair was thick and worn longer than even the country norm , so Poppy figured it kept his head warm . He wore faded jeans , work boots , and a plaid wool jacket that flapped open exposing a thermal shirt as he loped around to the passenger 's side and lifted both girls out . Each wore brightly colored parkas and carried small backpacks . " There 's lunch in the packs , " he told Poppy . " Heather made sandwiches last night . She always does it the night before ... always ... prepared . " His voice trailed off and he looked suddenly stricken , as though what had once been innocent , even praiseworthy , was no longer so . The implication , of course , was that Heather had been expecting something like this to happen  --  which Poppy could n't believe was true . So she urged Micah on with the hitch of her chin toward the road . " You go on . Get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already passing to her as the older child moved behind the wheelchair to push . Then she held out an arm to Star , who stood braced against Micah looking forlorn . Poppy had to pat her lap before the child came forward . " I appreciate this , " Micah murmured . For a moment , he looked at the girls in a startled way that said he was only then beginning to think about consequences . " They 're okay , " Poppy assured him . He looked at them a second longer , before returning to the truck . Poppy had Star on her lap by the time the truck was gone , at which point she declared , " Well , we passed that baton smoothly enough . " " What 's a baton ? " Missy asked . " It 's a thing that kinda looks like a rolled-up magazine . They use them in relay races , where one person runs his part of the race and hands the baton to another person , who then runs the next part . Push me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and held Star with the other , leaning around to peer at the smaller child . " Did you guys have breakfast ? " " We were gon na , then we did n't have time , " Missy answered from behind . " Daddy forgot , " Star said . " Daddy has lots on his mind , " Poppy said , " but I have only you , and besides , you love my kitchen . " She tightened her arm around Star as they rode up the ramp , entered the house , and headed straight for that kitchen . Everything in it was lower and more accessible than in a standard kitchen , from counters and cabinets , to sink and stove , to lazy Susans everywhere . For Poppy , these things were a necessity . The girls saw them as play . Poppy was dying to know more about Heather , because the situation was bizarre . But she could n't ask the children . Nonchalance was the way to go here . So she acted as if nothing were unusual as she popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doused them with syrup from the maple crop Micah had produced the spring before , she chatted with the girls about school , about snow , about upcoming Ice Days . Missy chatted back . Star remained quiet , close by Poppy 's side . " Doin ' okay ? " Poppy softly asked the little one from time to time , always getting a nod in return , albeit a solemn one . It did n't take a genius to know that the child was worried about Heather . She 'll be fine , Poppy wanted to say . She 'll be back . This is all a mistake . Your dad will take care of everything . But she did n't say a thing , because she did n't know a thing . And that irked her . She prided herself on being the pulse of Lake Henry , but she had n't seen this one coming . She wondered if anyone had . The more she wondered , the more annoyed she grew , because her thoughts moved beyond the simple fact of an arrest . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said . But someone had fingered her . With virtually anyone else , Poppy might have wondered if one ornery Lake Henryite had resented her easy acceptance by the others , but this was Heather . Everyone liked Heather . Even more , they liked Micah , who , though marginally reclusive , was a native , one of their own from the get-go . Heather would have been protected if for no other reason than that she was part of Micah 's life . Poppy particularly doubted that the betrayal had been internal , because there had been so many opportunities for others . Three months ago , Lake Henry had been the center of a news event that had focused on Poppy 's own sister , and the media had been all over town . Poppy would put money on the fact that someone from that faction was responsible for this sudden upheaval . But she could n't say that to the girls , either . So , calmly , she washed syrup off their hands and mouths , helped them back into their parkas and pulled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride the lift with her up into the brand-new Blazer that her mother had insisted on buying her before the onset of winter . It was poppy red and had been adapted for her needs ; once the three of them were inside , she patiently pointed to buttons and let the girls retract the equipment . Focusing solely on them , she made sure they were belted in , drove them to school , and gave them big hugs before sending them off . The instant they disappeared inside , she was on her cell phone calling John Kipling . Though born and raised in Lake Henry , John had spent most of his adulthood in exile . Given that he had left town at the age of fifteen  --  and that he was ten years older than Poppy  --  she had been too young to know him then . They had become friends only in the three years since his return . As of nearly six weeks ago , they were even related . On New Year 's Day , John had married Poppy 's sister Lily . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brother-in-law . She was calling because he was the editor of the local newspaper , and she had an ax to grind . Since it was barely eight-thirty in the morning , she tried him at the little lakeside cottage that Lily had inherited from their grandmother , Celia St. Marie . The cottage was smaller than John 's a bit farther down the shore , but it had a history . So John had moved in , and they would be putting on a sizable addition once sugaring season was done . Micah was slated to do the work , which gave John an even greater incentive to help figure out what had happened to Micah 's significant other . No one answered the phone . Poppy guessed that John was either having breakfast at Charlie 's Caf or already at work . She passed Charlie 's first . It was a cheery sight with snow capping the red clapboards of both the general store and adjacent caf . The wide brick chimney exhaled a curl of smoke , and a smell tinged with bacon and birch wafted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatting out front , their breath puffing white against their dark wool jackets as they huddled into upturned collars , but she saw no sign of John 's Tahoe . Less than a minute later , she spotted it down past the post office , at the yellow Victorian that stood near the edge of the pristine expanse of snow on the lake . That yellow Victorian housed the newspaper office . Had it been summer  --  or spring or fall  --  she might have pulled in and talked with John face-to-face near the willows . But this was winter , and winter made maneuvering in and out of the Blazer over icy paths , much less unshoveled ground , harder to do . Besides , she wanted to get home to her phone lines . So she simply punched in the Lake News number as she drove past . " Kipling , here , " John answered in the distracted voice that said he was buried in the Wall Street Journal , New York Times , or Washington Post . " It 's Poppy , " she said and jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ? " " Hey , sweetie . " His voice lightened instantly . " No . What 's going on ? " " You have n't heard any news ? " " Uh , we slept late , " he said a mite sheepishly . " Just got in , actually . " Poppy felt a twinge of envy imagining the why of Lily and him sleeping late . It did n't help her mood any . " And you have n't had any calls ? " she asked tartly . " You 'd know that better than me . " " John . " " No . No calls yet . " He was cautious now . " Tell me what I missed . " " Heather , " Poppy announced , letting loose with her disgust at the situation in general and the need to place blame in particular . " You missed Heather . " She gave him the basics , then said , " I 'm wondering how something like that could happen in a free society , because Heather is the last person I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . But someone did . So I 'm driving along here , " now on the road that circled the lake , with no other cars in sight , just tons of snow , scads of naked trees , and plenty of questions , " and I 'm thinking about who the canary could be . No one in town would snitch on Heather , because everyone here loves her , and even if they did n't , they love Micah , and even if they did n't , they would n't betray one of us for fear of reprisal from the rest . So I 'm thinking it has to be one of the bozos who was in town last fall during the whole mess that gave Lily her unwanted fifteen minutes of fame , and those guys are your friends  --  " " They are not , " John broke in , " but hold on , back up . What happened to Heather ? " Slowing when a deer darted across the road ahead , Poppy watched its white tail twitch as it leapt gracefully over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was arrested by the FBI . I do n't know much more . Micah dropped the girls here in a rush and went to get Cassie . They were going off after the Feds . I do n't know where  --  " " To Concord . The Feds go to federal court , and the nearest one is in Concord . " Poppy drove on at full speed again , both hands tight on the wheel , though the road was beautifully plowed . " Federal court . " She tried out the words . " Heather in federal court . Does n't work for me . " " That 's because you assume she 's innocent . " " Well , do n't you ? Think back to every single interaction you 've ever had with her . Did she ever sound like she was concealing a dark past ? " " No , but that 's because I do n't take her for a pathological liar . If she were one , though , chances are she could fool people . You 'd be amazed at how convincing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heather is totally honest . People trust her . Ask Charlie . He knows how to spot the good ones . It took him less than a year to get Heather out of the kitchen and into managing the restaurant . Hell , Kip , she 's the one he leaves in charge when he and Annette go away with the kids  --  and , technically , she is n't even working for him anymore ! Would he do that if she was dishonest ? " She edged the Blazer to the right when an old station wagon approached . It was the postmaster , Nathaniel Roy , on his way to work . Nat was a bespectacled seventy-five , but he was sharp enough to know Poppy 's Blazer and would have been agile enough to flick his headlights if he wanted her to stop . The fact that he simply waved and drove on told her that he had n't heard about Heather , either . " Poppy , you 're preaching to the choir , " John said . " I agree with you . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We have n't known you , either , " Poppy pointed out . " Or Lily . Both of you spent years away . " " But we were both born here . " " And you 'd condemn Heather because she was n't ? " " Poppy , Poppy , " John pleaded , " I 'm not condemning her . I 'm just making the same point that other people are going to make . " Poppy wanted to argue , but she knew he was right . " Fine then , let 's move on . Can you make some calls ? Find out where she is ? Try to keep a lid on things ? I do n't want history repeating itself . Lily was hit with false charges , and the result was two lost jobs , an abandoned apartment in Boston , and a media circus . " " The result of which , " John noted , " was that she fell in love with me . " " But Heather already loves Micah , " Poppy reminded him sweetly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crisis to bring her to her senses . Honestly , why would someone do this to her ? I can not imagine she has a single enemy in town  --  and while you 're asking questions , I want to know who thought he recognized her . In the process of clearing Lily 's name last October , you humiliated several rather powerful media guys . Think there 's a chance that one of them is seeking revenge ? " " They would n't dare . " Poppy gave a shallow laugh . " All three of them are still working . " " Yeah , but in lesser jobs and under closer watch , and there 's still me . They know I 'd have no qualms about pointing the finger at them if they tried to point it at someone here without cause . " " Well , someone did point a finger . While you 're in Concord , see if you can find out who . You 're an investigative reporter . Being nosy is what you do best . " " Yeah , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep this contained ? Restraint is the way to go . Ask too many questions , and people start thinking you have something to hide . So let 's concentrate on whatever 's happening in Concord today . Let me make some calls . I 'll get back to you when I hear something . " Poppy ended the call . Seconds later , she passed the stone wall that marked the entrance to Blake Orchards , her mother 's pride and joy . The stones of the wall were waist-high lumps of snow , and the sign was draped with more of the fluffy white stuff . If she turned in and drove a half mile along the gravel road , between stubby apple trees that looked smaller than ever without leaves , she would reach her mother 's house and a bit farther on , the cider house . Both were closed up for the winter . Instead , she stayed on the main road as it climbed a hill and wound away from the lake for a bit , then back . Turning onto her own road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , she quickly maneuvered her chair out of the Blazer and rolled inside to the console that held dozens of buttons . She was anxious for news . John would n't have called back so soon , but what she really wanted was a message from Micah. * * * Even slouched against the wall , Micah was taller than almost everyone else in the courthouse lobby , and a motley crew it was . Lawyers stood out from the rest in their suits , some of which had seen neater days . The people with them ranged in age from a pregnant young girl to a grizzled old man , and varied in dress from high school sloppy to rural casual , from Manchester stylish to Sanbornton woodsy to Claremont salt-of-the-earth . What all these people had in common was an air of unhappiness . It was an emotion Micah shared with them . This was not where he wanted to be . He was supposed to be in the sugarbush with Heather , checking the mainline for last-minute damage . Yeah , he could do it alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no choice , though . Cassie had told him to wait here , so he waited , his fists deep in the pockets of his flannel jacket , one booted foot flat to the wall , his eyes hooded , and his jaw clenched . He wanted to get Heather and get home . That was all . Get Heather , and get home . After what seemed like an eternity standing there in that lobby , surrounded by the rumble of low conversation , Cassie strode down the hall from a room at the end . Long-legged , she was a standout in wool slacks and a blazer , a silk blouse and scarf , and a head full of curly blond hair , but the pickup of Micah 's pulse had nothing to do with her good looks . He respected Cassie , but he was n't drawn to her for anything but her legal expertise . With Heather on his mind , he straightened . Cassie did n't say anything when she reached him , simply indicated that he should follow her . Down another hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , the upper half of which was a milky glass , then turned the knob . Micah expected to find Heather inside , but instead there were only an old , empty desk and a pair of battered metal chairs . " Where is she ? " he asked . " Apparently still on her way , " Cassie replied , putting her briefcase on the desk . " Here 's the thing . There 'll be a hearing in a little while . It is n't an indictment , per se , just a hearing in front of a magistrate during which the Feds return the warrant  --  the warrant in question being the one involving flight to avoid prosecution . Heather wo n't have to say anything . " She broke off when the door opened again . Micah 's insides lurched . Heather was there with a guard , who gestured her forward . She looked ghostly pale and even more terrified than she had been back at the house . Her silver eyes found his and held them , as though clinging for support . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second when he thought of the part of Heather 's past he did n't know , the knapsack he had stashed away and the words that the federal agent had said . We have evidence that her real name is Lisa Matlock , and that fifteen years ago she committed murder in California . If Heather was hiding something like that from him , it would explain the fear in her eyes . Then again , if she was innocent of the charges and feeling overwhelmed by something that was out of her grasp , her fear was justified . He focused on that thought . She had no sooner stepped into the room when he crossed the floor , pulled her into his arms , and pressed her face to his chest . He did n't want to see those fear-filled eyes . But he could feel her trembling , which was nearly as upsetting . His Heather had always been calm and even-tempered . She had always been brave , as sure of herself as anyone could be who was a newcomer to a town as insular as Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they 'd met . It had been fall . With the syrup season long done , he was in carpenter mode . Charlie had hired him to install a wall of windows in the caf to open it up to the birches . During the course of the job , he was in and out of the kitchen a dozen times a day . Heather was working there , first as a dishwasher , then helping prepare the food for cooking . She had n't said much . To this day she was n't a big talker  --  but neither was he . He remembered her being quiet , even shy , but self-assured . She had seemed comfortable with what she was doing , at peace , certainly not like a woman who was on the lam and had something to hide . The guard stepped out into the hall and closed the door , leaving them alone with Cassie . Micah said the first thing that came to mind , murmured against her hair . " Did you have breakfast ? " Heather shook her head against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . " He held her tightly for another minute , then lowered his mouth to her ear . " Where 'd this come from ? " She lifted a shoulder in a muted shrug . " Did you tick off someone in town ? " Another headshake . " Have you ever heard of that other woman ? " Heather started to cry . Micah did n't know if that meant she had or she had n't , but he looked at Cassie in desperation . " She is n't that person . What do we do ? " Cassie had stayed on the far side of the small room , giving them these few seconds together . Now she came closer . She touched Heather 's shoulder , the gesture of a friend , but did n't say anything . After a minute , she exerted the smallest pressure to make Heather look up . " I need to ask this , honey , " she said , " because I would n't be doing my job as a lawyer if I did n't . Are you Lisa Matlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm Heather Malone . " " There , " Micah said , annoyed . " You have it . What now ? " Cassie continued to study Heather 's face . After what felt to Micah like an unnecessarily long time , which riled him all the more , she exhaled and looked at him . " Now we fight . " He set his annoyance aside . " How ? " " We go into that hearing in a little while and contest the proceedings . That 's basically saying that Heather is innocent of the charges and that we will not waive extradition . " Heather made a frightened sound . Micah verbalized the source of her fear . " Extradition ? " " If we were to waive it , " Cassie explained , " she would be immediately taken to California to answer the charges they 've lodged . " " Would that be admitting she is Lisa Matlock ? " " No . It would be saying that we 'll let the courts there prove that along with the other charges . " " Since she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Right , but what I think and what you think and what she says is one thing . What the people in California think is apparently something else . " " Well , they 're wrong . I want the charges dropped . " Cassie smiled sadly . " If it were as easy as that , I would n't have much work . Our system of criminal justice functions in roundabout ways . " " Innocent until proven guilty , " Micah reminded her . Cassie hesitated several seconds too long . " Not always , " she said , shaking her head . With those words , Micah had the awful fear that the trouble was just beginning . * * * Poppy had no calls to take for a while , which was typical of a Lake Henry morning in winter . During other seasons , when fine weather beckoned , people were out and about doing whatever tickled their fancy . Rainy days , snowy days , cold days tended to keep them at home . They were answering their own phones . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , hacking ice from the eaves , and if not that , they were starting to think about getting geared up to settle down to work in the easygoing way that Lake Henryites had . She built the fire in the stone hearth to a blaze , made a pot of coffee , and sat back with a steaming mug of it to look at the lake , all the while wondering where Heather was , and what she was doing  --  and it was n't just a nominal interest . Poppy had other friends she 'd known longer than Heather , but Heather was the one she liked best . She felt closest to Heather , had from the first time they met . Poppy had been a sophomore at the state university , and Heather , who spent her work week inside at Charlie 's , loved the great outdoors . Each weekend , a group of them went mountain climbing , and though Poppy had more in common with the college students in the bunch , Heather was the one she talked with the most . Thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talking . Heather was a good listener , and Poppy , who felt constrained by the town in general , and her family in particular , had needed to vent . Then Poppy 's accident happened , and , through the nightmare of recovery , Heather had been there for her . She seemed to know what to do without being told . She did n't dole out pity or offer patronizing words of solace . Her underlying attitude was to accept what had happened and move on . That quiet approach had been a relief . Poppy was thinking about that quietness  --  about listening rather than talking , and whether there had been a reason for it that went beyond Heather 's basic nature  --  when a light blinked on the phone bank before her . Pushing that unsettling thought from her mind , she put on her headset , pressed the appropriate button , and said , " Lake Henry Library . " " Leila Higgins , please , " said an unfamiliar woman . " I 'm sorry . The library does n't open until noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Aileen Miller . I 'm with the Washington Post . I understand that Heather Malone worked at the library . I was looking for a comment from Ms. Higgins . " Poppy was dismayed , but not unprepared . When it came to handling the media , she had gone through trial by fire the fall before . Now she said , " Tell you what . If you give me your number , I 'll pass it on to Ms. Higgins when the library opens . " " Who is this ? " " The answering service . " " Do you have a home number for Ms. Higgins ? " " Tell you what , " Poppy offered sweetly . " Give me your home number , and I 'll pass that on to Ms. Higgins . " There was a pause , then a magnanimous , " Oh , I do n't want her having to pay . I 'd be happy to call her . " " I 'm sure you would , " Poppy replied . After another pause , Aileen Miller responded with resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poppy wrote down the woman 's name and number , then disconnected the call and made one of her own . " Police office , " came a grumble on the other end . " Willie Jake , it 's me . What do you know about Heather ? " There was a pause , then a testy , " What do you know ? " " Only that she was arrested . How could you let that happen ? " " I did n't ' let ' it happen , " came the indignant reply . " I 'm local . I ca n't control the Feds . " " Do they have evidence that Heather was someone else ? " " You know I ca n't tell you that . But would I have let them arrest her if they did n't ? " " What kind of evidence ? " There was a sigh . " I ca n't tell you that , lest I bias the case . But I 'll tell you this  --  it was all circumstantial . A bunch of old photos of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handwriting comparisons  --  all real iffy . But I say it again , these were Feds . I tried my best to change their minds , but in the end they did what they wanted to do . There 's no messing with these guys when they set their minds to something , and when they have the paper to back it up ... " He sputtered a drawn-out , " Whelllll ... " Poppy 's private line blinked and John 's number appeared . " Okay , Willie Jake . I get your point . Got ta run now . " She ended the call and punched in the blinking button . " Any luck ? " " She 's at the federal courthouse in Concord . A hearing 's going on right now . " " What kind of hearing ? " " On the warrant . I do n't know anything more . I got this from my buddy who covers the courthouse for the Monitor . He could n't talk . He wanted to get into the hearing . " " Did you ask him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John said , sounding dryly resigned . " He shot that idea down fast . " " Why ? Heather 's a nobody ! " " Well , the guy Lisa Matlock allegedly killed is a somebody . Was a somebody . His father was a United States senator from California at the time , earmarked for his party 's vice presidential nomination , which he got three weeks after his son 's death , in part thanks to the sympathy vote . The ticket lost , and DiCenza did n't run for the Senate again , but he 's still a force in the state , and he keeps the torch alive . " Poppy thought fast . " And you picture our Heather as the type who would mingle with political movers ? I do n't . She 's too private , too shy , too down to earth . Sorry , John , but something does n't jibe . " " Hey , I 'm just telling you what my buddy told me . This was a high-profile case at the time . My guess is it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there myself . Armand will want a story in the paper , and the best way to get it right is to see what 's happening firsthand . " " Find out why it 's happening , " Poppy pleaded , " why it 's happening to Heather . " " I 'll try . I 'll call you when I get back . " Poppy did n't want to hold him up . If anyone would give Heather a fair shake , it was John . So she simply added , " Please , " and disconnected the call . Slipping off the headset , she took up her coffee and looked out at the lake . She tried to imagine what Heather was feeling  --  wondered if it was confusion or numbness or fear , or something else entirely . She tried to imagine Heather sitting in a cell in Concord , but could n't give the image a face that fit . Heather always looked too ... gentle . The scar did that . It was small , not more than half an inch long and curved gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimist 's smile . Scars like that gave a person distinction . Many people had them . Another button lit on the console , Poppy 's private line again . This time , the number was that of Marianne Hersey 's bookstore . Putting one end of the headset to her ear , she pressed the button . " Hey . " " What is going on ? " Marianne asked . She was one of five women who had dinner at Poppy 's every Tuesday . Formally , they were the Lake Henry Hospitality Committee . Informally , they were good friends sharing news , laughter , and gripes . Heather had been with them the evening before , as she was every week . " I just got to work and was sitting down with my coffee and doughnut , thinking that maybe I 'd catch an author on the morning talk shows , and suddenly there 's breaking news from Concord . Do you know what they 're saying about Heather ? " " On television ? Oh God . What are they saying ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then fled from the scene of the accident and was n't spotted again until a member of the cold case squad got a lead from someone who was here last fall . What do you know ? " " Not as much as you do . I 'm going to go watch . I 'll call you back . " Poppy swiveled her chair , aimed the remote at the television , and turned on the set . No more than a second or two into channel surfing , she spotted a " Breaking News " banner . Since the story was just beginning , she suspected she had hit a different channel from the one Marianne had seen . This was not a good sign . The reporter had barely begun to talk when Poppy 's private line lit again . " It 's Sigrid , " came the voice on the other end . " Are you watching this ? " Sigrid Dunn was another of the Tuesday-night group . By day , she did large-loom weaving . The television was often on while she worked . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they talking about ? " " Let me listen . " She raised the volume . " ... a major break in the investigation of the murder of Robert DiCenza fifteen years ago in Sacramento . DiCenza , who was twenty-five at the time , was run down as he was leaving a political fundraiser for his father , then a United States senator from that state . The car that hit him was driven by an eighteen-year-old named Lisa Matlock , whom , sources say , had threatened him earlier that evening . The FBI alleges that Lisa Matlock has been living in New Hampshire for the last fourteen years under the name Heather Malone . She was apprehended early this morning at her home in Lake Henry . She surrendered quietly and was transported to federal court here in Concord . A hearing has just concluded , during which Ms. Malone 's lawyer formally contested the proceedings . That means that she will be fighting extradition . Since extradition is a state issue , the federal proceedings were dropped , and she has been turned over to the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transported to the superior court in West Eames for a hearing there later today . This is Brian Anderson for Channel Nine , with breaking news in Concord . " " Do you remember hearing about this murder ? " Poppy asked Sigrid . " No , but fifteen years ago I was in the Peace Corps in Africa , so I would n't have seen the news . Is this our Heather they 're talking about ? " she asked in disbelief . Poppy was just as befuddled . " Well , it 's our Heather who 's in custody , but it ca n't be our Heather who did that . " She paused , thinking of the rapport she and Heather had , the sense that they felt things other people did n't . " Can it ? " " No . Absolutely not . We know Heather . I mean , we do n't spend Tuesday nights talking about the weather . We talk about private things . We talk about intimate things . She could n't hide something like that from us . " Poppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood , but she could think of none . Heather was always more of a listener on Tuesday nights . She listened and asked questions  --  insightful questions that always got the others to talk more . " We do n't really know all that much about her , " Poppy said quietly . " It 's just that Heather 's not a violent sort . " " It 's just , " Sigrid echoed archly , " that someone 's up to no good . Someone in the press must have been pissed at us last fall . This is tit for tat . " " John says no . " " The news said that someone who was here last fall tipped off the cold case squad . Okay , so maybe John 's right . Maybe it is n't revenge . But someone was looking at things he was n't supposed to be looking at . " " Come on , Sigrid . They look at the crowd . Heather was in the crowd . " " Actually , not , " Sigrid pointed out . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missy had chicken pox . Remember ? " Now that she mentioned it , Poppy did remember . Heather had n't ventured any farther from home that week than the pediatrician 's office and the general store . Poppy herself had given Heather a blow-by-blow of all that she 'd missed . Except someone had n't missed as much as Heather had . Someone had seen a face , imagined a similarity , and thrown a wonderful woman 's life in limbo . Poppy wanted to know who that person was .
