Scene A rural town in southwestern Louisiana Time The Present Setting The action of the play takes place in BILL 'S office ( Stage Right ) and POP 'S home ( Stage Left ) . BILL 'S office is split level ; the platform contains a leather high-back swivel chair , a desk , and a lamp , and the lower level contains an over-stuffed leather chair used during the hypnosis sessions . POP 'S living area consists of a dining area containing a china cabinet , a buffet , a table , and chairs . GRANNY VI appears both at home and at BILL 'S office . She emerges and exits via the aisles in the theater and/or through the exit designated as kitchen . A white lace handkerchief is the link between GRANNY VI and the characters who invoke her . @x SCENE I : Early morning at BILL 'S office AT RISE : The scene opens in BILL 'S office with BILL taking notes . CAROLINE enters and interrupts him . She is wearing her medical paraphernalia , lab coat , stethoscope , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie , and a navy blue sleeveless pullover sweater vest . During hypnosis , CAROLINE becomes increasingly fidgety , alternating between shaking her legs , twisting her hair , and holding her shoulders . CAROLINE ( poking her head in the door ) Bill , may I have a few minutes ? One of my patients did n't show up , and I thought I 'd run downstairs to see if you had a cancellation . BILL ( scribbling notes ) Actually , I do . I was just finishing up this report . Give me a second . CAROLINE I know I 'm on your calendar for later today , but I 'd rather meet with you this morning . BILL That 'll work for me . CAROLINE Great . ( taking a deep breath ) I 'm so grateful we work in the same building . ( pause ) I hope you do n't think I 'm taking advantage of our friendship . p. 4 BILL Of course I do . That 's what friends do . They take advantage of each other . CAROLINE I 'm serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by popping in to see you . BILL Do n't sweat it , Caroline . You and I go back a long ways . We 've been friends for what , ten years now ? I 'd let you know if you were misusing me ( chuckling ) . CAROLINE Are you sure you do n't mind ? BILL It 's fine . CAROLINE I know there 's chemistry between us . We ca n't deny that . BILL But we do n't want to go there , right ? CAROLINE It would never work . Besides , we ca n't cross those lines . BILL Not while I 'm your therapist . CAROLINE Absolutely ! Let 's just stick to being friends . BILL You know I care about you . CAROLINE You 're my best bud , Bill . There 's not another soul I 'd let put me under hypnosis . And that 's a fact . BILL That 's called trust . ( finishing up his report ) So , what 's up ? p. 5 CAROLINE More of the same . I think I put something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILL What 's that ? CAROLINE I 've been anxious for a long time , you know that . But , I think my level of anxiety increased when my Granny Vi died . BILL I 've told you before , that 's a normal part of grieving . She raised you . She 's gone and now you feel a sense of loss , right ? CAROLINE It 's deeper than that . The loss , I mean . I miss my granny a lot , but there 's something else going on . ( looking down at her hands ) Look at my hands , they 're shaking . I sense there 's something inside of me that I ca n't get to , and that 's why I need your help . BILL Have you been going to the gym like I suggested ? CAROLINE Yes . Four or five times a week . I ca n't sleep . I 'm eating five and six Snickers a day . I 'm really tense about something . BILL We 'll keep working through this . It takes time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAROLINE I do n't think hypnotherapy is working . Three months of digging around in my past , and we 've come up with nothing . p. 6 BILL I disagree . We 've made good progress . CAROLINE I 'm just as uptight as I was when we started these sessions . Yesterday , I snapped at the director of the clinic . Can you believe that ? He 's my immediate supervisor . I really lost it . BILL What happened ? CAROLINE He 's a flirt . I know he 's harmless , but it makes me uncomfortable . BILL Do you feel he 's crossing boundaries ? CAROLINE Yes , and I do n't like it . It 's not just him , though . Seems like I 've been getting into it with everybody at the clinic . Most of my colleagues are men and ... well ... they seem to cross the line often . Maybe , it 's me , but ... BILL But things are getting out of control . CAROLINE Right . I 'm tense . I need to see some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about your father last time . That 's progress . CAROLINE Really ? BILL ( changing the subject ) I think we 're getting closer to finding out why you ca n't remember blocks of time from your childhood . p. 7 CAROLINE I 'm starting to feel anxious right now . Just the mention of those lost blocks of time makes me feel tense . I know there 's something inside of me that 's begging to come out , but it scares me . BILL Maybe we should consider ... CAROLINE ( interrupting BILL ) I do n't want an antidepressant . I discussed it with my primary care physician . She says it might help . Maybe I do need something . I do n't know ... BILL You 're a wonderful woman . You have to allow yourself to see how wonderful you are . CAROLINE You 're biased . Everybody thinks I have it together . There goes Dr. Caroline Mark . She 's on a fast track in her profession  --  was named Oncologist of the year for the entire state of Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not . There 's this brick wall and I ca n't get around it . I 'm jammed up . It takes all my energy to pretend I have it together . What would my cancer patients think if they knew I was a fraud ? BILL You 're not a fraud . CAROLINE Do n't you understand ? I 'm strapped with something that keeps me up most nights . I 'm scared , Bill . p. 8 BILL We 'll work through this . CAROLINE Will you listen to me ? I am spinning out of control . I 'm afraid of everything . Afraid of loving ... I ca n't live like this anymore . BILL Let 's get you to relax . CAROLINE And , I just found out today that Jackie is trying to take Pop . BILL Take him where ? CAROLINE To live with her . Granny Vi 's only been dead six months and Jackie is itching to make changes . She thinks Pop should n't live in the house anymore . BILL But you 're there with him . CAROLINE It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pop needs better care . BILL Does he ? CAROLINE He gets around on a walker without any problems , same as always . He 's grieving , but that 's natural . BILL Then what 's the real issue ? CAROLINE The real issue is ... Jackie wants to get her hands on Pop 's social security check . Maybe she just wants to control everything . She called before I left for work and we had a big argument about Pop . I 'm not letting her take Pop away from our home . It 's his home , and when he says he wants to leave , he 'll leave . Jackie is not having her way with me , not this time . p. 9 BILL I 'm happy to see you so assertive . This is progress . The more you prevent people from walking all over you , the better you 'll feel about yourself . CAROLINE I do n't feel good about arguing with Jackie . We go around and around until she wears me out . We start on one point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . Old grudges . Things I have no control over and ca n't do anything about . BILL Close your eyes and relax . CAROLINE I 'm on the edge ... Do you think I 'm losing it , Bill ? BILL Look , we 've been through some pretty sensitive stuff in the past few months . I did n't think you were ready for the asylum when you began obsessing . CAROLINE Do n't remind me . I paired every sock and found covers for every plastic container in the kitchen cabinets . BILL We worked through all of that , Caroline . CAROLINE And of course , there was the AIDS scare . I just knew I had AIDS . Remember the report in Newsweek about those dentists who do n't sterilize properly ? I had an allergy attack and blamed it on AIDS . I vowed I 'd never get my teeth cleaned again . BILL Then you started obsessing about your hair . You were sure that you were going to be bald in a matter of days . You started counting the strands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past a mirror without looking at my thin spots and wondering how long until I was completely bald . I really was out of control . BILL You were trying to adjust to what 's disturbing you . CAROLINE I need to know what 's making me so anxious , and I 'm not going through twenty years of therapy to find out . I 've wasted too much of my life already . BILL Let 's get started . CAROLINE ( attempting to get up from the chair ) Wait ... BILL Caroline . ( gesturing for her to sit ) Sit back . ( dimming the lights ) Take a deep breath . Close your eyes . This time keep them closed . Drift away . Go all the way down . Good . Keep breathing deeply . I think we 're making real progress . Let 's talk about your father . In our last session , you mentioned firecrackers . Go all the way down . You know the cue . At the count of three , I want you to tell me what you see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Caroline . ( CAROLINE is terrified ; she shrieks and lifts both feet into the chair . ) BILL Caroline , what are you remembering ? p. 11 CAROLINE ( resisting what she 's remembering ) The snakes . The snakes are all around me . They 're biting me . Make them stop . Get away . Get away from me . Get away . They 're biting me. ( out of breath ) They 're all over me . I ca n't make them stop biting me . BILL Take deep breaths , Caroline . Drift away . Go all the way down . Take long , slow deep breaths . Open your eyes now , Caroline , but you will remain in a deep hypnotic state . The snakes are gone now . Are they gone ? CAROLINE Yeah , they 're gone . ( putting her feet back on the floor ) BILL Tell me about your father and the firecrackers . CAROLINE ( in a daze ) It was Christmas . My brother , Ben , and I were fighting over firecrackers . BILL Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CAROLINE Yeah . I miss him . BILL I bet you do . So , tell me about that Christmas and the firecrackers . CAROLINE Daddy was drunk ... totally out of his mind . ( pleading in a boy child 's hot-tempered voice ) " Daddy , Caroline wo n't give me no firecrackers. " p. 12 BILL What happened then ? CAROLINE ( straining not to tell ) He just came from nowhere , talking out of his head , and snatched me up . I was ten ... but I remember . His eyes were on fire . He threw me up against the bedroom wall ... like I was a basketball . He punched me in the stomach two or three times . I remember the punches most of all . ( leaning forward and cupping her mouth like she 's going to regurgitate ; speaking in a child 's voice ) " Mommy , mommy , make him stop . Make him stop , mommy . Daddy , please ... please . Mommy ... mommy . " ( speaking in her own voice ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat . ( speaking in a powerful woman 's voice ) " You gon na hurt that child . Do n't beat that child in the belly . She ai n't gon na be able to have no babies . Leave her alone , you hear me ? Stop hurting my child . " BILL What do you want to tell your father ? CAROLINE ( adamant ) Nothing . BILL Sure you do . CAROLINE ( less sure of herself ) Nothing . BILL Talk to me , then . It 's ok . I 'm right here . I 'll listen . p. 13 CAROLINE ( voice cracking ) He took away my confidence ... ( pause ) . He was always getting drunk and hurting one of us. ( pause ) I never forgot about the time he tied Jackie 's braids to the iron bed and banged her head every time she tried to get away . I saw it and I ran ... I ran into the closet . My little feet just ran . BILL Where was your mother ? CAROLINE I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CAROLINE She left us behind . BILL Where did she go ? CAROLINE To Detroit . With her new boyfriend . She left us with Daddy . BILL Who drank too much . CAROLINE ( to herself ) He drank more after Mama left . He ruined his liver . BILL Is that when you went to live with your grandparents ? CAROLINE Yeah , after Daddy died . Pop and Granny Vi raised me and Jackie . BILL Back to your father .... and the abuse . Do you believe he felt sorry for hurting you ? p. 14 CAROLINE He hurt me . Why does it matter if he was sorry ? BILL It matters . Sometimes it 's easier to forgive and move on when we know the abuser is sorry . Do you think your father was burdened by his actions ? CAROLINE I do n't think he remembered . He drank so much of the time . He was a big bully . BILL Did you ever talk to him about the abuse ? CAROLINE I was too scared of him . We used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember holding my breath whenever I was around him . BILL Caroline , I want you to find your father . Look for him . Can you see him ? Go way back . ( CAROLINE turns her head in a semi-circular motion each time she regresses or progresses under hypnosis . ) CAROLINE ( in a six year old child 's voice ) I can see him . BILL How old are you ? CAROLINE I 'm six . BILL Talk to your daddy . CAROLINE ( hesitant ) Nooooooooo . BILL Try . p. 15 CAROLINE ( fearful ) Daddy ... Daddy . You hurt me . You 're a bad , bad man , Daddy . I do n't like you ... because you keep hurting me . I remember you made me kneel on a bed of gravel behind the house in the hot sun . I was just a little girl , Daddy , doing and saying little girl things . How come you hurt me ? BILL What 's he saying , Caroline ? CAROLINE My daddy 's crying . ( speaking in her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I made a whole bunch of mistakes , and I 'm sorry . I love you , child . I love all my children . " ( pause and in a six year old child 's voice ) But you hurt me. ( pause ) I did n't hear you . ( speaking in her father 's voice ) " We did n't have a crust a bread and I took it out on your mama and y'all. ( his voice cracking ) I 'm sorry ... so , so sorry . If I could , I 'd do things different . I did n't mean to hurt you , child . I wish I could take it all back and keep you safe . Protect you instead of ... hurting you . BILL Do you have anything to tell him ? Let it go , Caroline . It 's time to let it go . CAROLINE No . I can't. ( shaking her head to indicate that she ca n't let go of the pain . ) Daddy , you hurt me. ( thrashing intensifies ) No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're hurting me. ( screaming ) Granny Vi , make him stop it . Granny Vi , please make him stop it . p. 16 BILL Just relax . Come on back . You 're not quite ready to remember yet . Find your way back to the present . I 'm going to count backward . You know the cue . At the count of one , open your eyes . Three , two , one . ( Lights fade to black. ) p. 17 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT I SCENE II : Mid morning of the same day at POP 'S home AT RISE : POP is sitting at the dining room table with his walker next to him . He is wearing Khaki pants and a plaid work shirt . CAROLINE enters from the kitchen carrying a tray , a pitcher of ice tea , and two glasses . POP always pronounces CAROLINE 'S name CARRY-LINE and JACKIE 'S name JACKLEEN . POP Carry-line , what were you and Jackleen arguing about early this morning ? CAROLINE Just stuff , Pop . You know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping something from me , Carry-line ? CAROLINE Why do you ask that ? POP It 's not like you to take off in the middle of the day . You should be doing your work . CAROLINE I just felt like coming home , Pop . It feels good to be in here . POP Another bad day at the clinic ? Are those white folks messing with you again ? CAROLINE Pop , I feel alienated . There 's me and then there 's them . POP ( rolling up his sleeves to show he 's reading for a fight ) Let me know if I need to go over there and put a whipping on those white boys . I wo n't stand for nobody misusing my grandbaby . And that 's a fact . p. 18 CAROLINE I 'm fine . Do n't you love this old house , Pop ? POP ( unrolling his sleeves and chuckling ) Of course , I do . CAROLINE This is the only place I 've ever felt safe . POP It 's your home , Sugar . CAROLINE You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jackie . I can still feel Granny Vi 's presence . She 's in the walls . I can still smell her cabbage and ham hocks . Her sausage jambalaya . Her gumbo . All of it . Right here in these walls . POP Oh , she 's here , all right . There are a lot of memories in these walls . Your grandmother and I lived in this same spot for forty-five years . And before that , Mom and Papa called this place home . Someday , it 'll be yours and Jackleen 's . CAROLINE Did I mention Jackie 's coming over to make gumbo ? She said you need tending to . POP Is that why you came home ? Are you and Jackleen having some little meeting ? Do n't y'all be talking about me behind my back . CAROLINE No , I just needed to be in a safe space right now . Jackie has her own agenda . POP That girl acts like I 'm helpless . I just let her do . It 's easier than arguing with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 19 CAROLINE I try not to , but she has a way of knocking me off balance . POP Just look past it . Her little drinking problem gets the best of her sometimes . She means well . CAROLINE I 'm not putting all the blame on Jackie . I 'm a bit on edge myself . To tell you the truth , Pop , I 've been lost without Granny Vi . POP Nobody 's been the same , Sugar . Every little thing in the house reminds me of her . She 's in everything I touch around here . CAROLINE I miss her , Pop . POP Lord knows I sure do . I just wish I had done right by Viola . CAROLINE You did the best you could , day in and day out , while she was sick . I do n't know another man with a walker who could have taken care of his wife like you did . POP But it was n't enough . I should have made my peace . CAROLINE What do you mean , Pop ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing jeans and a sweat shirt . She has a can of beer in one hand and a shiny container in the other . She pours the beer into her favorite drinking vessel which she carries around in every scene . ) JACKIE What are you doing here in the middle of the day ? ( bypassing CAROLINE to greet POP ) Do n't you have a job ? p. 20 CAROLINE I need some down time . I decided to take the rest of the day off . JACKIE Why ? Are your white folks giving you the blues , too ? I 'm not surprised . POP Come on in , Jackleen . JACKIE Hey Pop . ( kissing him on the forehead and then hugging him ) POP How you today ? JACKIE I ca n't complain . It would n't do any good anyway . POP Ai n't that the truth ? How 's Malcolm ? JACKIE He 's fine . POP And little Tim and Jessica ? JACKIE Hardheaded -- you know how kids are . How are you feeling today , Pop ? POP ( grabbing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving me the blues , but I ca n't complain too much . Jesus woke me up this morning in my righteous mind . ( chuckling ) JACKIE Did you take your Advil ? POP I 'm on my way to get some now . JACKIE ( rolling her eyes at CAROLINE ) I 'll get it . Caroline , why did n't you get Pop his Advil ? p. 21 POP I can get it , Jackleen . I 'm not helpless yet . And do n't be blaming Carry-line . I did n't tell her Old Arthur was bothering me today . JACKIE Well , she should have asked . She 's the doctor of the family , right ? POP Now settle down , Jackleen . It 's too early in the day to start your foolishness . ( exits ) JACKIE ( calling to POP ) Ok , Pop . I 'm just trying to help out . CAROLINE Are you still making gumbo ? JACKIE ( signifying on CAROLINE ) Somebody 's got to cook around here . I hate to see Pop eating four-day old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not taking care of Pop . I cook every chance I get , and when I do n't , I pick up something . JACKIE Some of that stuff in the fridge has hair growing on it . Are you growing penicillin in there ? CAROLINE I just have n't had the time to clean the refrigerator . But do n't accuse me of not taking care of Pop . JACKIE Humph ! You have answers for everything , do n't you ? But I 'm still taking Pop to live with me , Malcolm , and the kids . p. 22 CAROLINE Shhhhhhh . Let 's not talk while Pop 's up . ( wanting to change the subject ) Soooooo , you did n't have to work today ? JACKIE I can take off just like you . Anyway , they 're giving me the blues at the office . ( noticing CAROLINE 'S nervousness and distraction ) What 's wrong with you ? CAROLINE I 've been putting in a lot of hours . I 'm really tired and stressed . JACKIE You 've always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you used to get so nervous you 'd pee in the bed . ( laughing ) Are you still peeing in the bed ? CAROLINE How many beers have you had today ? JACKIE None of your business , little sister . Do n't try to change the subject . Are you still peeing in the bed ? CAROLINE Jackie , you need to go take a nap . JACKIE Why , because the little baby ca n't remember wetting the bed ? CAROLINE I do n't remember , Jackie . And I wish you would n't tease me . JACKIE I 'm not teasing you . I 'm just trying to help you remember things . Peeing in the bed is one of those things . I hated having to clean up behind you . When Mama went off to Detroit , you peed in the bed a couple times a week , child . Daddy used to get you up to use the bathroom , but you 'd still pee in the bed . Do n't you remember that ? p. 23 CAROLINE I do n't ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not that important . I was just thinking ... you were getting ready to go to high school before you stopped wetting the bed . ( laughing ) I used to call you polecat  --  because you were always spraying the bed sheets just like a nasty little polecat . I thought you 'd want to take that to your shrink-friend , Bill . Ask him why you wet the bed so much . CAROLINE Who told you I was in therapy ? JACKIE Pop told me , but I had already figured it out . CAROLINE Really ? JACKIE Girl , you 've been hanging around with Bill for years . I know you tell him all your business . CAROLINE I feel safe with him . JACKIE You 've got the hots for him . CAROLINE We 're just friends . JACKIE I can see sparks between y'all and you 're both ducking and dodging and dipping and acting like white folks . CAROLINE How did white folks get into this conversation ? JACKIE White women do n't date their therapists . Everybody knows that . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy to keep a sistah and brotha from dancing the dance . Especially if there were sparks flying between them like I 've seen between you and Mr. Freud . ( laughing ) p. 24 CAROLINE I do n't see anything funny , and please lower your voice . JACKIE If you got your own place , you would n't have to worry about Pop hearing us . CAROLINE Granny Vi 's only been dead six months and you 're trying to uproot Pop . That 'll kill him to make a big change like that . JACKIE ( burping ) He 'll get used to it . CAROLINE No , he wo n't . Leave him alone . You just want to get your hands on pop 's check . JACKIE That 's a lie . CAROLINE If you need money , I 'll lend you some . JACKIE I 'm not after Pop 's money ... and I do n't want a dime from you . CAROLINE So what is it you 're after ? Control ? You want to control Pop , me , the house ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you 've had more than one drink this morning . I think you should take a nap , and then we 'll talk about what 's best for Pop . ( trying to make conversation ) Did you call in sick today ? JACKIE ( irreverently stressing Dr. Caroline each time she says it ) Yes , Dr. Caroline , I did . p. 25 CAROLINE I know you do n't want to lose your job . JACKIE Now look at you , who 's pointing the finger now ? I know it 's the third one I 've had in two years . CAROLINE ( softly ) You 've got to try to make it work out . JACKIE Look at the pot calling the skillet black . Pop told me you 're not getting along with some of the doctors at your clinic . You 'd better watch out before you get fired , Missy . CAROLINE I wish Pop would n't tell my business . JACKIE I wish you 'd stay out of mine . Look , let 's cut the small talk . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... JACKIE I felt like bringing it here and stuffing it down your throat . CAROLINE If you 're going to talk like this ... JACKIE Do n't tell me how to talk . I said to myself , " Well , I know I 'm just a secretary . I 'm not some big fancy cancer specialist like her , but she could have called me on the phone and talked to me like I 'm people , too . " CAROLINE We always wind up fighting . I did n't know what else to do . p. 26 JACKIE So you wrote me a letter and told me I 've got ugly ways . CAROLINE I asked you to stop criticizing me . JACKIE I bent over backwards to help you through medical school . Sent money to you off the top , before I paid my own bills . And you did n't appreciate any of it . CAROLINE That 's not true . JACKIE Well , you have a terrific way of showing it , Dr. Caroline . CAROLINE I want you to stop treating me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I 'm always hurting your feelings you should stay out of my way . CAROLINE You should watch what you say . JACKIE You need to get a thick skin , baby girl . CAROLINE No , you need to know that you 're hurting me . Seems like telling you would be enough , but you keep right on with the insults . ( mimicking JACKIE ) " You do n't live in the real world . " ... " You ca n't cook dry beans . " .. . " You know medicine but you do n't know anything else . " .. " Where did you get your M.D ... from Harvard or from A&amp;P ? " JACKIE ( mimicking CAROLINE 'S blocked memory ) " I do n't remember . I ca n't remember any of that . Big chunks of time are gone  --  just slipped away from me . " You 're a nut ! p. 27 CAROLINE See , there you go again . You 're mocking me . You think it 's funny I ca n't remember . JACKIE Get over yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it be . Quit acting like it 's the end of the world . Lots of people do n't remember things . CAROLINE But I need to ... JACKIE The walls are closing in on me. ( exiting ) I need to get out of here . CAROLINE You 're running because you 're scared , are n't you ? I 'm getting too close . JACKIE ( re-entering ) Too close to what ? CAROLINE I 'm getting to you . Any minute I might ask you something ... like ... does it still hurt that daddy beat you with a tree branch that time and Granny Vi took a sugar cane to him ? JACKIE ( stammering ) I do n't remember any such thing . And do n't be running daddy down . He 's not here to defend himself . CAROLINE He beat you , Jackie . I do remember that ! JACKIE You do n't know the first thing about Daddy . He was tired of owing his soul ... breaking his back on land that did n't belong to him . p. 28 CAROLINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that like it was yesterday . Granny Vi made him back away with her cane . JACKIE Granny Vi was a meddlesome old woman . And she never did get to Daddy with that cane . ( laughing ) She tripped and those big white bloomers nearly scared him to death . ( laughing ) Whoosh ! ( laughing ) CAROLINE Everything that comes out of your mouth has to be a joke . Why is that ? Nobody can be that happy and that funny all the time . What are you hiding behind all that laughter ? JACKIE Go to hell ! That Harvard M.D. has gone to your head . CAROLINE You know what , I do n't think my degree has a thing to do with your taking pot shots at me all the time . JACKIE What are you talking about now , Dr. Caroline ? CAROLINE You do n't want me to be close to you . I scare you for some reason . Maybe you 're afraid I 'll make you remember those years when we were too scared to breathe . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat us . JACKIE How you gon na make me remember anything and you ca n't remember squat yourself ? The blind leading the blind . You got jokes , baby girl . p. 29 CAROLINE There are lots of things I do n't remember , but what I do remember , I wish I could forget ! JACKIE You need to move on . CAROLINE I ca n't ; I 'm stuck . You 're mad because you think I 'm ok ... that I survived those beatings without scars ... That I 've made it and you have n't . That 's what you think , do n't you ? JACKIE Girl , sometimes you act like you crawled out from under a shell . And you better watch out because you 're dripping slime all over my happy day . CAROLINE What happened to us ? We ca n't keep dancing this dance . JACKIE You 're making me tired . ( burping again , this time louder . ) CAROLINE It 's not even noon and you 're drunk . JACKIE ( rushing over to slap CAROLINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your stupid mouth up . CAROLINE You put your fist up every time I come near you . If Granny Vi were here , you know she would n't let us fight like this . JACKIE Even Granny Vi let me down . She hurt my feelings really bad . CAROLINE How 's that ? p. 30 JACKIE I did everything I could for Granny Vi while you were off becoming Dr. Caroline . I cooked , cleaned , did laundry , drove her everywhere she needed to go . And I do n't regret a bit of it . I 'm just saying ... CAROLINE Saying what ? JACKIE I never saw her eyes light up for me the way they did for you when you walked into the room . I loved Granny Vi , but her eyes never lit up for me . I do n't think she ever told me thank you . CAROLINE She loved you , Jackie . You know she did , in her own way . Do n't talk like she did n't love us both . JACKIE I 'll say what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to talk . Let 's talk , baby girl . I worked my butt off to take care of Granny Vi and Pop and you 'd blow in for the weekend and get all the praise . CAROLINE I tried my best to praise you for all the things you did for Pop and Granny Vi . JACKIE I felt like a field hand . ( pause ) And then when Granny Vi got sick , you moved back home . By then , you were the big cancer specialist . And nobody else was worth anything in Granny Vi 's eyes . CAROLINE ( awkward ) She talked about you all the time . She could depend on you . She loved you , too , Jackie . p. 31 JACKIE Not like she loved you , though , and there was n't very much left for me . CAROLINE How can we make things better between us now ? JACKIE You can help me get Pop ready to move over to my house . He needs somebody to look after him all day long . CAROLINE How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You work all day , just like me . JACKIE I can quit this little nickel and dime job tomorrow and take care of Pop . CAROLINE And why move him ? JACKIE Because I 'm tired of coming over here to clean up behind him and you . CAROLINE You 're not taking care of me , Jackie . You have n't in a long time . No , there 's something more going on here . What 's really up ? JACKIE I am so tired of you ; let me get out of here . Tell Pop I 'm going to get some shrimp for the gumbo. ( exiting ) CAROLINE ( calling after JACKIE ) I 'm not letting you take Pop . JACKIE ( Offstage ) Yeah , right ! ( CAROLINE removes the tea from the table , slamming the tray on the buffet . POP enters with his walker carrying in his shirt pocket GRANNY VI 'S white lace handkerchief. ) p. 32 POP What were you and Jackleen carrying on about ? CAROLINE Same old thing , Pop . POP ( stopping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I wok up , I found Viola 's handkerchief in the bed with me . I must have put it there before I fell asleep . CAROLINE Oh , look at it . She loved that handkerchief . POP She sure did . CAROLINE Did you have a good nap ? POP I wish you 'd woke me up . Lord , I was having the worst nightmare . CAROLINE About Granny Vi again ? POP Yes , Lord . She came to me in a dream . I 've been dreaming about her a lot lately . She talks to me , you know . Oh , Viola , I wish you were here . ( GRANNY VI appears . She is wearing a Sunday-go-to-meeting two-piece white suit , white shoes , a small white hat , and white gloves . She has in her hand a white lace handkerchief that matches the one POP has in his hand . ) CAROLINE I 've been dreaming about her , too . POP Sometimes I feel like she 's right here with me. p. 33 CAROLINE I feel that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rubbing my back . Sometimes I feel her kissing me on the forehead . And sometimes , I feel a breeze and then I 'll smell her Estee Lauder perfume . It all feels so real . But , she 's on the other side , Pop . POP Lord , if I could just have my Viola back . I could make things right with her . CAROLINE What do you need to make right , Pop ? POP Viola was the sugar in my coffee , but I did n't do right by her , I tell you . CAROLINE What did n't you do , Pop ? POP Take care of Viola like I should have . CAROLINE Granny Vi was blessed to have you . POP She was n't always blessed . I did a terrible thing long years back . CAROLINE What did you do , Pop ? POP I do n't know if I can tell you ... been so many years back ... but I want to tell you . Because Lord knows I do n't want to leave this world without begging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Viola 's place and let me beg your pardon . I need to unburden myself , Sugar . CAROLINE You know you can talk to me about anything , Pop . p. 34 POP I know it . That 's why I 'm coming to you . I woke up ... and I could n't get Viola 's face out of my mind . I thought my heart would give up on me . I thought maybe it was my time . Seems like Viola was in the room with me . I got to tell you something that chills my bones . CAROLINE Tell me , Pop , it 's ok . Whatever it is ... POP I 'm talking about the day Viola got caught in the barn . CAROLINE Who caught her ? What are you saying , Pop ? POP I ai n't never told nobody . You hear me ... nobody . But I saw . CAROLINE What did you see , Pop ? POP I saw Old Man Broussard catch Viola ... ( pausing with fists clinched ) that piece of poor white trash. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn . I saw it with my own eyes . CAROLINE ( moving toward her grandfather midway between him and GRANNY VI ) Oh , my Lord , Pop . POP He took her . That 's what he was used to doing  --  taking colored women when he wanted them . CAROLINE She never told me she had been pinned down like that . Who was this piece of trash ? p. 35 POP He owned the land we worked . We worked from ca n't see to ca n't see for Old Man Broussard . That was n't enough for him . He wanted my Viola . It was a sickness , I think . He took her and I saw it with my own eyes . One day I was coming from breaking corn ... and that 's when I saw it . I remember I wanted to crawl into the ground . I almost stopped breathing . Old Man Broussard had pinned her down in the barn ... like Jesus on the cross . I can still see it . And he was drunk . Had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my Viola . Yes , Lord , he forced himself on my Viola . White men could do that back then and get away with it . CAROLINE I do n't know how she survived it . And it must have been horrible for you . POP Well I declare , I watched him take her , and I could n't move . My mind started playing tricks on me . One second I was in the barn with my feet glued to the ground , and the next I was on some big ship packed together like sardines in a can ... packed so tight ... no light ... no air ... dry heat that burns your flesh . ( covering his eyes with VIOLA 'S handkerchief ) Then Viola screamed and I was back in the barn . I could n't breathe . I threw up . I emptied myself right there in the barn . CAROLINE ( on the verge of hyperventilating ) She must have been so afraid ... p. 36 POP I know I was . Child , I looked down and saw my feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't moving . I think I lost my mind that day . My feet was just a running . CAROLINE Your feet were running , but you were n't moving . POP That 's right , Sugar . I was stuck . But after awhile , I commenced to running . I ran ... ran ... ran , I tell you . Long as I live ... I 'll never forget that I ran off and left Old Man Broussard taking what he wanted . ( simulating the act ) He was just laughing and grunting and laughing and grunting . I saw it and I ran . I beg your pardon , Viola , the sugar in my coffee . And ... I beg your pardon , Caroline , for running off and leaving your grandmother . CAROLINE I love you , Pop . POP Viola thought I had run off with some little finger-popping woman . That 's what I told her when I came back some months later . The truth is I left her because I could n't stop seeing the hurt in her eyes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to fend for herself . Oh , in time we patched things up . We never talked about that day in the barn . She never brought it up , and I was too coward . We acted like it never happened . CAROLINE I bet she was ashamed . p. 37 POP I know for a fact she was , but I could n't talk about it . Never could . Now , it 's too late to tell Viola what a coward I was , so I 'm telling it to you . I needed to tell you I was a coward . I do n't want you to be like me . Sugar , if somebody pins you down , get back up . That 's what Viola did . I was a coward , and I 'm sorry . Do n't you be a coward , Caroline . Do n't you run away from your troubles like I did . Viola told me in the dream this afternoon to talk to you . She said , " Tell Caroline : GRANNY VI AND POP ( simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a way to get back up . " POP Yep , that 's what she said . Oh , Lord , I feel better already . Took a load off my feet , yes Lord . GRANNY VI ( singing ) " We 've got the power to heal ourselves . We 've got the power to heal ourselves . Oh , we 've got the power to heal ourselves . ( exiting into the kitchen ) CAROLINE ( singing and massaging her grandfather 's neck and back ) " We 've got the power to heal ourselves . " POP That was Viola 's favorite song . CAROLINE I remember , Pop . " We 've got the power to heal ourselves . We 've got the power to heal ourselves . " ( JACKIE enters ) p. 38 JACKIE ( to CAROLINE ) What are you doing singing to Pop ? You sound like a pig stuck under a fence . POP Now , Jackie , leave her alone . CAROLINE I thought you were going to get shrimp . JACKIE ( to POP ) I made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's a special on shrimp , Pop . POP I know how you like your coupons . CAROLINE ( exiting through the kitchen door ) I 'll go start the water for the gumbo . POP ( indicating the GRANNY VI 'S handkerchief ) Jackleen , look what I found when I woke up from my nap . JACKIE ( taking the handkerchief ) Granny Vi 's favorite handkerchief . Lord , she loved this one , with all that lace . ( GRANNY VI emerges from the kitchen with the mention of her handkerchief . ) POP Jackleen , what 's going on between you and Caroline ? JACKIE Nothing , Pop . You know how sisters are . One likes red beans ; the other likes black-eyed peas . p. 39 POP I ca n't stand to see the two of you carrying on . Viola did n't like it neither . Y'all try to get along . JACKIE Do n't worry about us , Pop . POP I 'm going out to get a little fresh air in the back yard . Let me know when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crab , and oysters in the gumbo . I know how much you love seafood , Pop . POP I can taste it already . ( exiting singing ) " We 've got the power to heal ourselves . Oh , we 've got that power to heal ourselves . " JACKIE ( still holding onto the handkerchief and talking to it ) Well , Granny Vi , I wonder what mess you 're stirring up in heaven ? You sure gave me the blues . Always praising Caroline . Like she was your only grandchild . I was here , too , Granny Vi . I washed your old butt plenty days , and you did n't even say thank you . ( ringing of cymbals of dimming of lights when GRANNY VI speaks ) GRANNY VI Thank you , Jackleen , you silly child . JACKIE ( terrified ) Lord , have mercy . ( collecting herself ) That beer is getting to me . ( JACKIE is terror stricken as she looks straight ahead while GRANNY VI speaks ) p. 40 GRANNY VI You better straighten up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Here you are carrying on like the world owes you something . Well , it does n't . And if you keep waiting for somebody to come around and hand you a good life , you 're going to wake up and find you 've missed out , child . I know you think I 'm meddlesome , but that 's because I wo n't let you get away with foolishness . And as for talk about me not loving you , ... Child , I loved you with everything inside of me . You see only what you want to see . You like being miserable , and you want to make everybody around you feel your misery . That 's not right , child . You better stop that foolishness , and I mean right now . I am here to set you straight  --  shake some sense into you , before it 's too late . JACKIE ( dropping the handkerchief on the table and running out of the house ) Oh Lord , let me out of here ! ( Lights fade to black. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III : one day later in BILL 'S office AT RISE : CAROLINE is pacing the floor while BILL sits at his desk taking notes . CAROLINE is fidgeting with GRANNY VI 'S lace handkerchief . ) CAROLINE Something strange is going on with Jackie . BILL Like what ? CAROLINE She was supposed to make gumbo for Pop last night . She went out to get shrimp and did n't come back . I called over to her house and Malcolm told me she was asleep . That 's not like her . Pop was waiting for his gumbo . BILL Has she been drinking again ? CAROLINE Pretty hard . She needs help . I 'm trying to get her back into AA . BILL What about you ? How are you doing ? CAROLINE I 'm pretty shaken up about Jackie wanting to take Pop to live with her . I ca n't figure her out . She 's got her hands full with her kids . We had it out about Pop yesterday . It was ugly . BILL What does your grandfather think of Jackie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm hoping Jackie will forget about it . Maybe it was just the beer talking . Hey , guess what , Pop told me a story yesterday that blew me away . The man he worked for raped Granny Vi in the barn ... right next to the pigs and the chickens ... and Pop ran . He told me he ran . p. 42 BILL ( writing notes on his pad ) Why did he tell you ? Why now ? CAROLINE He told me Granny Vi came to him in a dream and told him he needed to talk to me . He asked me to take my grandmother 's place and forgive him . It was so hard for me to hear that somebody raped my Granny Vi . It was like I was there . Like it was happening to me , and my little feet just started running , too . BILL Did he say why he ran ? CAROLINE He said he was scared . He knows I 'm dealing with something and he knows I 'm scared , too . He wants me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last night he told me a bunch of stories about people in our family who had been pinned down , but who got up . BILL Oh , yeah ? CAROLINE Yeah , he 's full of stories about our ancestors . He told me about my Great Uncle Paul who was tied to a barrel in Opelousas and whipped for stealing corn to feed his hungry children . A group of white men whipped him in the " for whites only " park and then put salt in his wounds . Pop said Uncle Paul almost died , but he would n't give the white men who beat him the satisfaction . BILL That was a horrible hate crime . CAROLINE But Pop did n't focus on the lynch mob . He focused on Uncle Paul 's will to live . Pop said Uncle Paul was pinned down , but he got up and raised his family . He did n't run away . He told me he does n't want my feet to keep running , Bill . p. 43 BILL He 's right , you know . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what else Pop told me last night ? BILL What ? CAROLINE He said , " When you 're feeling whipped , Caroline , call on your ancestors . " BILL Sounds like good advice to live by . CAROLINE ( beginning to rub her chest ) My chest is hurting . Jackie 's stressing me out . BILL Let 's get you to relax . See if we can get that pain to go away . CAROLINE ( suddenly sad ) Bill , do you know what 's wrong with me ? BILL ( jokingly ) You 're neurotic , psychotic , and mentally disturbed . CAROLINE ( jokingly ) I know that , but what 's wrong with me ? BILL That 's it , Caroline , you keep that sense of humor . CAROLINE Granny Vi used to say , " You got ta have a sense of humor , Tootsie . It 'll help you bounce back from the blows of life . Then life wo n't owe you nothing . " p. 44 BILL She was a wise woman . Now close your eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the count of four , and let it go slowly . Exhale every obstacle to your relaxation . That 's it . Drift away . Let go . Now , let your breathing settle down . You know the cue . I 'm going to count to three . One ... two ... three . Raise your right hand if you can hear me . ( CAROLINE raises her right hand . ) BILL Put it down . Open your eyes slowly . But you will remain in a deep hypnotic state . In one of our sessions recently , you said you often felt ugly and ashamed when you were a child . CAROLINE I did . Sometimes I still do . I feel different and alone . BILL Can you tell me about a particular moment when you first felt different ? CAROLINE ( fidgeting with the handkerchief ) I do n't know  --  maybe when I was nine or ten . BILL Find your way back to when you were nine . Tell me what happened back when you were nine . CAROLINE ( giggling and speaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . ( GRANNY VI appears . ) CAROLINE She 'd never admit it , but she did n't like dark skin ... and do n't you know ... she was sundown brown . Well , one day she wormed and squirmed her way to our house and was looking at all the pictures on the wall . She started with my oldest sister and moved on down the line to my cousins ' pictures . She said : p. 45 GRANNY VI Ooooooooh child , look at that Jackie . She got such pretty hair ... good hair ... straight hair ... just like white folks . And look at Betty , such high cheekbones and teeny-weeny lips ... pretty child . Do n't have much Africa in her , no sir . And look at Linda ... with that smooth high yellow skin ... child most can pass for white , yes sir . And oh , look at Marie ... that child is prettier than all the rest ... hair most blonde and eyes gray as a cat . CAROLINE Then she moved to my picture and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly child . I do n't know where y'all got that little ugly black Buckwheat . Look at those two big teeth in the front . And that little nappy hair brushed to one side . And , oooooooohhhhhh child , that little thing got big feet and a big belly . She looks like a poor starving child in Africa , yes she do . " And then , she must have seen the light go out of my eyes because she shouted , " But Carry-line , she makes 4,000 points in school , yes she do . That 's a smart child . She might be president some day . She 's our Moses . CAROLINE AND GRANNY VI ( simultaneously extending their hands to suggest generations ) She 's gon na carry us through . She 's gon na carry the line through to the next generation . GRANNY VI Yeah , she 's the one . " p. 46 CAROLINE She said I was the one . ( GRANNY VI makes conjuring motions to CAROLINE while BILL delivers his next line . ) BILL Find your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to close your eyes again . This time I want you to go still deeper . Drift away . Caroline , you are to relax and begin seeing yourself the way the world sees you . You are smart , beautiful , sensitive , and sensuous . Do n't let the snakes get to you . And you do n't have to stay pinned down . Starting today , whenever you hear negative things that eat at your confidence , merely say to yourself , " Cancel , Cancel ! " Do you understand me ? CAROLINE I do . I 'm to say , " Cancel ! Cancel ! " ( GRANNY VI exits . ) BILL Let 's move to a new topic . I want you to go still deeper . Drift away . Feel every muscle in your body loosening up and freeing you to relax . Go all the way down . Feel the clouds beneath you as you imagine your body floating peacefully . Are you totally and completely relaxed ? CAROLINE ( with a heavy tongue , almost sounding drunk ) Absolutely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAROLINE They 've been short lived . p. 47 BILL Why ? CAROLINE Jackie says it 's because I 'm frigid . BILL What do you say ? CAROLINE ( hesitant ) I get uptight in romantic relationships . BILL Do you know why you get uptight ? CAROLINE No . I just ca n't respond the way a woman should . BILL How do you mean ? CAROLINE I do n't feel anything . There 's no passion . I 'm not in it . I do n't even want it . I like to be held close , but I ca n't give anything more . BILL Why ? CAROLINE I 'm afraid . BILL What are you afraid of ? CAROLINE I do n't know . BILL Are you afraid of loving someone ? CAROLINE Maybe . Who could love me without hurting me ? I ca n't take that risk . BILL You have to be open to it , Caroline . CAROLINE I 've had at least a dozen men friends . They 'd get close . Want too much . I 'd find something wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . p. 48 BILL Who 's Frank ? CAROLINE Somebody I thought I was going to marry . BILL What happened ? CAROLINE He dumped me . BILL Why ? CAROLINE He said I was just a tease . All talk and no show . One night , we were making out and I freaked . Just for a minute , I thought he was raping me . I started fighting him . ( She recalls the scene with much animation . Note : CAROLINE ca n't separate one abuse from another , even under hypnosis , at this stage of her recovery . She links Frank 's aggression with her father 's abuse . ) Stop it . Stop hurting me . Get away from me . The snakes are biting me . Make him stop , Mommy . The snakes are all over me . They 're all around me . Get your hands off of me . Make them stop , pleaseeeeeeeee . Oh , God , make it stop . Mommy . Mommy . Mommy . ( Lights Fade to Black . Intermission ) @x SCENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Friday early afternoon AT RISE : JACKIE enters and goes to buffet , holds up an 810 photo of GRANNY VI , and pours a glass of Vodka . She 's already had too much to drink . She picks up GRANNY VI 's handkerchief from the buffet . JACKIE ( fingering the handkerchief ) I ran out of here a couple of week ago because I thought I saw you , Granny Vi . I have to cut back on some of this Vodka . It 's making me nutty . I 'm back and I 've got news for Dr. Caroline . Today is the day I tell Pop I 'm taking him to live with me . I do n't care what Caroline says . Pop should n't be staying here all by himself every day . We need to sell this old rattrap of a house . Something is not right in this house anymore . I can feel it in the walls . This house has got to go . Caroline will have to find herself another place to hide from herself . Scaredy cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me sick , with her uptight self . She acts like she 's the only one with problems . Like she 's the only one with a past filled with the blues . ( GRANNY VI materializes and JACKIE looks straight ahead in fright. ) p. 50 GRANNY VI Lot 's of folks get bruised and knocked around , Jackleen . You ai n't lived unless you been pinned to the ground at least once . Some get up and wash the bruises and keep moving ... and some ... well some just get mad and mean , like you , Jackleen . JACKIE ( waving her hands ) Get out of my face , Granny Vi . Go back to where you came from and leave me alone , you old bat ! I did everything I could for you , but I could n't do anything to make you happy like your precious ( sneering ) Carry-line . Get out of my sight . ( GRANNY VI disappears into kitchen . ) JACKIE What am I doing talking to myself ? I do not believe in spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( chuckling ) I wonder where Pop is ? He 's probably visiting one of the neighbors , maybe Mr. Jacob or Mr. Mansy. ( picking up the handkerchief again ) You let me down , Granny Vi . I just wanted you to love me . What did I ever do to make you not love me ? What did I do that was so horrible that you could n't forgive me ? I needed you to love me . Was it the drinking ? I went to AA for you . You never gave me one word of encouragement . I stopped going after you died . What 's the point ? Huh , Caroline is seeing a shrink to try to remember and I 'm drinking to try to forget . What a pair we are . Just lovely . ( GRANNY VI reappears. ) p. 51 GRANNY VI You 're carrying around a secret , and it 's eating you up , child . You got to give it to God . You hear me , you got to give it to God . JACKIE Get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . GRANNY VI You have to find a way to get that bitter taste out of your mouth . Bitterness will break your back , child . You have to come to Jesus . Jesus will heal you . He 'll help you carry the load . But , first , you got to come to Jesus . JACKIE ( screaming ) Stop it . ( holding her ears ) Get out of my head ! GRANNY VI Your feet ca n't keep running . What you do in the dark , will come out in the light of day . You got to make things right , Jackleen . JACKIE What are talking about old woman ? Why are you bothering me ? You 're talking nonsense . GRANNY VI Just say you 're sorry , and Jesus will wash away your sins . JACKIE Go away . I do n't want you here . You 're talking in riddles . I do n't know what you want from me . So , just get out of my head . ( GRANNY VI disappears into the kitchen again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 CAROLINE What 's wrong , Jackie ? Who are you screaming at ? JACKIE Do n't you see Granny Vi ? She 's messing with me . CAROLINE You 've had too much to drink , Jackie . JACKIE So , are you calling me a drunk ? CAROLINE I am too tired to argue . JACKIE Girl , you 're tense . You need to loosen up . You need to get yourself a man . That 's all you need . That 's why you 're so uptight . You ai n't never had a real man to help you relax . I know just the man . There 's this guy I work with who lost his wife about six months ago , so you know he 's carrying a load . He is some fine . I bet he could ring your bell . CAROLINE Thanks , but no thanks . JACKIE See , you do n't listen to anything I tell you . That 's why you 're all messed up . You 're just a candle waiting to be burned , baby girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to JACKIE ) I do n't have time for nonsense . I had a hard day . JACKIE Hey , we all got to go sometimes . CAROLINE Jackie , this Black woman , this single mother of three children , is only 45 years old . p. 53 JACKIE Oh , a sistah ? CAROLINE Yes , and she 's going to die . JACKIE I 'm sorry about the sistah , but life ai n't fair , Caroline , so you better deal with it . CAROLINE Listen at you , you 're sounding like Granny Vi . ( GRANNY VI appears . ) CAROLINE She used to say : GRANNY VI Sugar , life ai n't always fair , and if you keep on waiting for life to be fair , somebody 's gon na come along and pin you down and you wo n't be able to get back up . " CAROLINE She told us so many stories about the ancestors . Ca n't you hear them sometimes ? She used to say : GRANNY VI When the ancestors call , you better listen , child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was the point ? I never got the point . CAROLINE The point was that she was telling us about ourselves ; we just could n't see it then . Lately , I 've been trying to remember all those stories . Pops been telling me lots of stories at night . He gets all fired up . Do you remember the story about Granny Vi 's sister , Cleotha ? JACKIE I heard it at least a hundred times . p. 54 GRANNY VI My sister Cleotha did n't let her husband run her crazy . When his outside woman came to Cleotha 's house , she pitched him and his little no-necked woman out the door . CAROLINE And do you remember the one about Doublehead ? JACKIE How could I forget it ? GRANNY VI Doublehead tried to violate my cousin , Marguerite . He came scratching through her bedroom window and she put birdshots in his backside . He come to try to fill her up with his shotgun , but she got him with hers first . JACKIE Oh , yeah , sorry to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell . CAROLINE And what about the story Lutie Mae Johnson ? GRANNY VI When Lutie Mae Johnson married that little white fellow , the church members ate into like she was red beans and rice . When she started having all those babies , everybody thought it was a disgrace . They called her all kinds of dirty names ... hussy this ... heifer that . Lutie Mae did n't let nobody break up her home , and she did n't walk around with a sour taste in her mouth because folks was acting mean and nasty . She kept on smiling and having those babies . Yes , Lord , honey . She had thirteen little yellow babies , and she named them after every pastor , deacon , head mother , usher and Sunday school teacher she could think of . p. 55 JACKIE But , what was the point of all of those old stories ? CAROLINE The point is somebody just like us went through tough times , and it was n't the end of the world . JACKIE I still do n't get the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . All those old stories just made me tired . CAROLINE You were n't listening . JACKIE The old stories were boring . They put me to sleep , ( talking to an imaginary GRANNY VI ) with all due respect to you , Granny Vi CAROLINE Granny Vi had courage . And I want to be like her . GRANNY VI Yes , Lord , life do n't owe me nothing ! JACKIE ( picking up the handkerchief ) I got to give it to her ; she was a tough old hen . GRANNY VI ( exiting to the kitchen ) Jackleen , a secret will eat you up . You have to give it to Jesus , and do n't take it back . CAROLINE I miss her . Did I tell you she 's been coming to me in my dreams ? Just as clear as day . JACKIE ( still a bit bewildered ) Listen , Caroline , I do n't have all night to hang around . I just want us to come to some agreement about Pop . Will you help me talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters with his walker. ) p. 56 JACKIE I thought you were up the block , Pop . POP I was . I came through here thirty minutes ago and you were snoring so loud I thought you were sawing logs . So , I took a little nap , too . CAROLINE How was your day , Pop ? POP I was having a good day until I heard Jackleen in here talking about selling my house . JACKIE I want you to come live with me . POP I heard you . I 'd rather go to the nursing home . JACKIE Pop ! POP ( becoming angrier with each succeeding line ) I mean it . What makes you think you can walk in my house and just take over ? Like I 'm senile and ca n't make my own decisions ? CAROLINE She did n't mean ... POP Stay out of this , Caroline . JACKIE I 'm trying to look out for you . POP No , you 're not . If you were , you would have asked me what I wanted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a child . I 'm a grown man , and you had better mind what you say . CAROLINE ( to JACKIE ) Did n't I tell you this would upset Pop ? p. 57 JACKIE Pop , you did n't hear all of my plans . POP I do n't want to hear nothing more about your plans . JACKIE My house has two spare bedrooms , Pop . There 's plenty of room for your stuff . POP Jackleen , did n't you hear me ? I am not thinking about leaving my home . I do n't think I could sleep in another house . Lord , I 'd have to leave all these stories in the walls behind . And , Lord knows the walls in your house are empty ... nothing but sheetrock and two-by-fours . JACKIE Now why you want to talk about my house like that ? It 's better than this termite-infested place . POP ( shouting ) This termite infested house kept a roof over your head . Kept you safe ... JACKIE I did n't mean to upset you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . POP How could I be better off ? My friends live up and down the block . I 've talked across the fence nearly every day with Cousin Laura for forty years . I 've hung around nearly every day with Mansy and Jacob for the past fifteen years . JACKIE They could come visit you . POP Child , Mansy and Jacob have n't crossed the bayou in thirty years . Do you think they 'll cross it to come over to your house . They do n't even drive anymore . p. 58 JACKIE You could make new friends . CAROLINE Jackie ... POP I do n't want new friends . I like the ones I have now . I like everything just the way it is . My doctor is just a few blocks away . My church is just three blocks .... But more than anything , I wo n't leave Viola . JACKIE What ? POP You heard me . She 's in these walls . So , go on back there and get yourself a little nap . Sleep off some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've had a nap . JACKIE I 'm all right . CAROLINE Go on , Jackie . JACKIE But , Pop ...

Imagine you are a brick wall and the bullet that is about to come your way can not destroy you . Do you see yourself as a brick wall ? CAROLINE Yes , I am a brick wall . BILL Can you handle the bullet that 's coming ? CAROLINE ( fidgeting with the handkerchief ) I can . I 'm ready  --  me and the ancestors ( touching her heart ) . I have them all stored right here . They wo n't fail me . Granny Vi is with me . ( GRANNY VI appears . ) BILL I wo n't fail you , either . Go back now . Go back to when you were between the ages of five and seven . Go back to the time you blocked from your memory . You have repressed something and only you can name it . I ca n't name it for you , but I am fully confident that you are ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . You 're a little girl again . Go back . Are you there yet ? ( CAROLINE recalls her molestation in a little girl 's voice. ) p. 60 CAROLINE ( whimpering a bit ) Yes . ( more whimpering ) It 's dark . I 'm scared . BILL Do n't be afraid . I am right here with you . I will not abandon you . I will be here , no matter what . I promise . Tell me , Caroline , what 's happening in that dark space ? CAROLINE I 'm scared . I 'm trembling . ( beginning to exhibit nervous leg movement ) I ca n't make my leg stop shaking . BILL It 's ok , let it shake . Do n't try to stop it . CAROLINE Ok . BILL What do you hear in this space ? ( sound effects  --  a fan ) CAROLINE There 's a fan and it 's making noise . Like it needs to be oiled . BILL Any other sounds ? ( sound effects -- laughter on television ) CAROLINE There 's a television on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's watching the Brady Bunch . I can hear Marsha laughing in the background because Jan is complaining , " Marsha , Marsha , Marsha . It 's always about Marsha . " BILL Can you smell anything in this space ? p. 61 CAROLINE It smells like liquor . Smells like somebody 's been drinking . BILL What else , Caroline ? What else do you smell ? CAROLINE ( pausing a second ) Urine . I smell urine . Somebody 's wet the bed . I can feel the wet spot . It 's cold . A cold , wet bed sheet . BILL Can you see anything in the dark ? CAROLINE I see somebody . I 'm scared . BILL Who is it ? CAROLINE I ca n't see . It 's too dark . Wait , I see someone covered in a blanket . BILL Ok , let 's skip back a bit . What happened in that dark space where you are right now ? CAROLINE ( hesitant ) Somebody hurt me. ( whimpering and thrashing around . ) No , stop it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . Stop touching me. ( screaming ) Mama , make it stop . ( hyperventilating ) I 'm going to tell Mama . Yes , I will . I 'm going to tell . I do n't care if you beat me . Get away . You 're hurting me . Ouchhhhhh . Mommy , mommy , mommy . ( fighting with her fist ) Get away . Get away . Get away . p. 62 BILL Caroline , settle down . Take a deep breath . It 's ok . CAROLINE No , it 's not . I 'm a bad girl . I 'm a bad little girl . I 'm so ugly ; I ca n't stand to look at myself . I hate myself . I 'm dirty . I ca n't get the dirt off me . I do n't want it there . Make it go away . BILL Ok , Caroline , let 's go forward again . Can you see the blanket ? CAROLINE Yes , I see it . BILL You must pull off the covers . CAROLINE Nooooooooooooo . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , noooooo . BILL Do n't be afraid , Caroline . You have to pull the covers off of him so you wo n't be afraid anymore . He ca n't hurt you anymore . CAROLINE I ca n't . I 'm too tired . My hands ca n't move . I ca n't move . I 'm just lying in this cold , wet spot on the bed sheet . I wet on myself . BILL Get up , Caroline . Get up from that wet spot and go pull off the covers . CAROLINE I ca n't . BILL Let 's get Jackie to come help you . Ok , that 's good . Yes , let 's get Jackie . CAROLINE No , do n't get Jackie . Jackie is tired , too . p. 63 BILL ( surprised ) What ? Did somebody ... ? CAROLINE Somebody hurt Jackie , too . ( whimpering again . ) BILL Is it the same person who hurt you ? CAROLINE ( shaking her head ) No . Do n't make me look at that . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this . BILL You can not resist my instructions , Caroline . You have to comply . Go all the way down . Let 's get back to Jackie . Can you tell me who hurt Jackie ? CAROLINE I 'm not sure . BILL Ok , let 's take it slowly . Can you see Jackie anywhere ? CAROLINE She 's in Daddy 's bedroom . And she 's crying . BILL Why is she crying ? CAROLINE Because somebody hurt her . BILL Did you see what happened to her ? CAROLINE Yes . BILL I want you to identify him . CAROLINE ( hyperventilating ) I ca n't stand to look at him . ( hiding her eyes . ) He 's the devil . He 's been drinking Vodka . There 's a big bottle of Vodka on the floor . p. 64 BILL Name him . CAROLINE It 's Uncle Syrus . BILL ( stunned again ) Uncle Syrus ? CAROLINE Yeah , daddy 's baby brother . He 's sleeping in daddy 's bed . Wrapped in Daddy 's blanket . He hurt Jackie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ? CAROLINE He 's our sitter . Daddy went out to the club . Uncle Syrus always sleeps in Daddy 's bed when Daddy goes out . He hurt Jackie in her private . ( trembling and crying . ) BILL Did you see him hurt Jackie ? CAROLINE Yes . I was playing with my doll in the closet . I do n't think he saw me . I saw him hurt her . I kept quiet . I could n't move . I was so afraid . My little feet started running but I was n't moving . I was stuck . BILL Focus on the blanket . Is he under the blanket in the bed ? CAROLINE No . He 's not there now . Uncle Syrus is n't there with me in that cold wet spot . It 's not Uncle Syrus . BILL Are you sure , Caroline ? CAROLINE I 'm sure . BILL Just relax . Keep on relaxing . Who is under the blanket ? p. 65 CAROLINE I do n't know . BILL I believe you do . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who hurt you . Who took away your innocence ? CAROLINE I ca n't do it . BILL You have to do it now , while you still have the courage . You told me the other day Granny Vi gives you courage . Call on her now . CAROLINE Granny Vi . I need you . ( GRANNY VI moves closer to CAROLINE and begins conjuring , working her healing majic . ) BILL Ask your Granny Vi to help you pull off the covers . I know you can do this , Caroline . Go to the blanket and pull off the covers now . CAROLINE I 'm getting scared again . I do n't think I can . BILL It 's time now ! You have to do this now . Pull off the covers right now . Right now , Caroline . CAROLINE Please do n't make me do it . I 'm afraid . BILL You 'll always be afraid if you ca n't name him and see that what he did was wrong . The little girl in you needs to know that she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman you need to become until the little girl in you is healed . p. 66 CAROLINE ( crying ) I 'm so afraid . Can you come with me ? BILL I 'm right beside you . But , you have to do it . I ca n't do it for you . CAROLINE Ok , I can do it . If you 're with me , I can do it . ( GRANNY VI simulates pulling off the cover and CAROLINE follows with the same motion . ) CAROLINE ( pulling off the imaginary covers and gasping . ) Oh God ! Oh God ! Oh God ! BILL Who is it ? CAROLINE ( her breath is taken away ) Oh , my God . BILL Who do you see ? Name him ! CAROLINE It 's Jackie . BILL What ? CAROLINE Jackie touched me in my private . BILL Are you sure ? CAROLINE I 'm sure . BILL Are you absolutely sure ? CAROLINE ( crying ) I can see her . It 's Jackie . BILL Ok , Caroline , we 've made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start your journey forward . Come on back . Find your way back to the present where you will remember everything you just saw . You can handle this now . There are people around you who will continue to help you . You can now name the thing that has kept you running your whole life . You will be able to deal with this new information . I 'll help you . I will not abandon you . I 'm going to start counting backward . You know the cue . At the count of one , you will regain full awakening consciousness . Three , two , one . Open your eyes , Caroline . ( After a second or two , CAROLINE remembers what she remembered . She puts her hands up to her mouth and begins to cry . BILL takes her in his arms and lets her empty herself . GRANNY VI encircles CAROLINE . ) ( Lights Fade to Black. ) p. 67 p. 68 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT II SCENE III : Mid afternoon one week later at POP 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen touching the chairs , picking up a picture of herself , and savoring the moment . JACKIE emerges from the bedroom yawning . She 's been napping . She sits on the couch and picks up GRANNY VI 'S handkerchief . GRANNY VI What 's done in the dark , comes out in the light of day . That secret is eating you alive . ( exiting into the kitchen ) JACKIE ( shaking her head as if to shake GRANNY VI away ) This hangover is doing me in . ( CAROLINE enters . ) CAROLINE ( very restrained ) I did n't know you were here . JACKIE I quit my job today . CAROLINE What happened ? JACKIE White people . They give me the blues . I called and told them , " I 'm out of here . " ( CAROLINE walks around but says nothing . ) JACKIE I came over here to see what Pop was up to . We 've been on the outs since he told me he did n't want to come live with me. p. 69 CAROLINE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to hurt my feelings like he did . ( mimicking POP ) " I 'd rather go to a nursing home . " That old fool . CAROLINE ( angry ) Stop it ! He 's not the fool . You 're the fool . JACKIE Who are you calling a fool ? CAROLINE You . For thinking your dirty little secret would never come out . JACKIE What 's wrong with you ? CAROLINE Where 's Pop ? JACKIE He 's down the block at Mr. Mansy 's house . CAROLINE Good . Because I want to talk to you and I do n't want Pop to hear this . This is between us , you and me . JACKIE So what 's on your mind ? CAROLINE The secret is out , Jackie . JACKIE ( stunned ) What secret ? CAROLINE I know what Uncle Syrus did to you , and I know what you did to me . ( JACKIE turns away from CAROLINE . ) JACKIE Do n't come here with a lot of noise . My head hurts . I told you I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you I got fired ? p. 70 CAROLINE Fired ? You just said you quit . Look , I do n't care about your job . I do n't even care about you right now . JACKIE Baby girl , you better get a grip . CAROLINE Cut it out , Jackie . I had a session with Bill last week , and I remember everything . I 've been trying to digest all I remembered but I am still so angry I could explode . JACKIE I do n't know what you think you remember . But you better stop shouting at me and tell me what you 're talking about . CAROLINE Uncle Syrus raped you . I was playing in the closet with my little doll with the red ruffles and white lace . JACKIE Oh , you remember playing with dolls now .. ( an exaggerated whine ) " Jackie , why do n't I remember any dolls ? Everybody tells me I had dolls , but I do n't remember one . Not one . " So , now you remember that scraggly haired doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comb that doll 's hair . CAROLINE Jackie , I did n't remember that doll until last week . Bill put me under hypnosis and helped me to remember . JACKIE Bill is a freak , if that 's what he helped you to remember . CAROLINE Uncle Syrus did n't know I was in the closet . I was just playing with Ruby . Yeah , that was my dolly 's name . He came into the bedroom . He pinned you down . You were fighting him . Biting him and scratching him . He had his hand over your mouth , but you kept clawing at him . I did n't know why he was fighting you , but I was scared . I was so afraid . I could n't move I was so scared . Then after he left , you started crying . When I tried to come sit next to you , you pushed me away . You were so angry . You hit me on the head . Do you remember ? p. 71 JACKIE I do n't know what you 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were always crying after that . Every time I looked for you , you were somewhere off crying . JACKIE That shrink has filled your head full of nonsense . CAROLINE Do you think I 'm lying ? Do you think I would make up something as horrible as this ? JACKIE ( pouring herself a glass of vodka ) I think you made up something in your head to explain why you 've always been a little bit off . CAROLINE What was I thinking ? I thought I could talk woman to woman with you . Tell you what I remember . JACKIE Uncle Syrus never touched me and I certainly never touched you . Oh , my God , what do you think I am ? A pervert ? CAROLINE You know , Jackie , what you did may have only lasted a couple of minutes , but it has hung over me a whole lifetime . And now you 're standing here telling me I 'm lying . JACKIE I 'm saying it 's all in your head . You 've been obsessing too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging . CAROLINE And that 's why you kept teasing me about seeing a psychologist . You did n't want me to remember . You were hoping this would just go away . That I would stop walking around here like I 'm about to pee in my pant . Oh , Lord ! p. 72 JACKIE I know where you 're about to go , but do n't even try it . CAROLINE Polecat . You 've been calling me polecat for years . I started wetting the bed because of what you did , and you called me polecat . I am this close to strangling you , Jackie . And the only reason I 'm not , is because I 've spent years learning restraint . That 's what children who 've been molested do . They spend all their energy trying not to spin out of control . JACKIE You 're pretty out of control now . CAROLINE ( with clinched teeth ) You had better pray that I can keep it together , because you have n't seen out of control . JACKIE You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the reason I 've been scared of everything . You know how you always tease me about my night light ? ( mimicking Jackie ) " Oh , look at that little stinky pus ; she has to sleep with a night light . Are you scared of a boogey man ? " Well , yes , Jackie , I 'm still sleeping with my night-light , because I 'm afraid of the dark . I 'm afraid somebody is going to touch me in places no little girl should be touched and make me feel dirty . I felt dirty . I thought it was my fault . So dirty , that I had to block it out . That 's how I survived , Jackie . I had to block it out . p. 73 JACKIE I can see you 're going through something , and I do n't know what to do . CAROLINE You can own up to what you did . JACKIE I did n't do it , Caroline . CAROLINE Yes , you did . I can see it in your eyes . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear when I see it . I 've lived with it my whole life .. I thought it was because Daddy whipped us . I think I 've been confusing the whippings with molestation . I guess after a while , one bad thing feels like another . It 's all the same thing . But I 'm not confused anymore . JACKIE It does n't matter what I say , you 've made up your mind that I did some dirty little thing to you and you 're all messed up because of me . CAROLINE That 's right . You did some little dirty thing to me . JACKIE How many times do I have to tell you that all this mess is in your head , girl ? And this is the thanks I get for helping you through medical school . CAROLINE I appreciate all that you did , Jackie . JACKIE Well , thank God for that . CAROLINE But it was guilt money . I remember thinking how nice it was for you to send me so much cash . I did n't expect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't let me give it back . You said I 'd be insulting you . I think in the back of your mind , you wanted me to succeed . p. 74 JACKIE Not in the back of my mind . In the front of my mind . You wanted to be a doctor , and I was your big sister . I was supposed to help . CAROLINE And when I became an M.D. , you never let an opportunity pass to call me ( sneering ) Dr. Caroline . JACKIE That 's who you are , is n't it ? CAROLINE Do n't play with me , Jackie . You were jealous . You helped me and then you could n't stand that I was becoming successful . You wanted me to go get an education , and then come back exactly like I left . Well , I could n't . Education changes people . But you always tried to make out like I was acting like I was better than you . That was your projection of your own sense of inadequacy . JACKIE There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about jealousy . Let 's come clean . You 've always been jealous of me and my relationship with Malcolm and the kids . You have your M.D. , but you 're all alone and hiding out in this old house , scared of men . CAROLINE ( raising her voice ) You got that right . I was hiding , but I 'm not any more . I am out of the closet , if you know what I mean . JACKIE You 've always been frigid . You 're 35 and still a virgin . p. 75 CAROLINE Am I ? I do n't feel like one . I feel like no man could love me because I 'm so dirty inside . Remember Frank ? I loved Frank . JACKIE Yeah , I remember him . CAROLINE I would n't let him touch me . I was 30 and he could n't understand why he could n't touch me . That 's not normal , Jackie . JACKIE I told you to get that fixed . CAROLINE You 're so cavalier . Well , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pop . JACKIE Tell them what ? CAROLINE Tell them about what happened to you and then tell them about me . JACKIE Why would you want to tell them ? What can they do about anything ? CAROLINE They can help convince you to go into therapy , and they can support me while I continue with mine . JACKIE I do n't see why we have to tell . CAROLINE ( picking up GRANNY VI 's handkerchief from the table ) You do n't want to admit what 's happened , and I do n't think I can convince you of anything by myself . ( GRANNY VI appears ) GRANNY VI ( to JACKIE ) Do n't stand there holding onto a lie . Let it go . It 's eating you up . Syrus was a rattlesnake . He bit you , and you turned around and bit your sister . Lord , help us . Those snakes she 's been dreaming about . .. that 's you , Jackie . Carrry-line 's been walking around her struggling with snakes , and you 've been acting like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enough . You can lie to Caroline , but you ca n't lie to yourself and you sure ca n't lie to me . No more secrets . No more lies . No more blaming somebody for your troubles . Carry-line took this first step ; the next one is yours . You can keep on lying or you can put your foot on that snake 's neck . Say to that snake , " I wo n't let you claim another minute of my sister 's life , and I wo n't let you control mine not one more day . Talk to your sister , Jackleen . Meet her half way , that 's what you have to do . It 's never too late to say you 're sorry and start again , child . You can do it . I 'll help you . But , if you do n't make things right , I will be in your face for the rest of your life . You can count of me . ( GRANNY VI exits into the kitchen. ) p. 76 JACKIE ( moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything , I 'm just saying I do n't remember it the way you did . CAROLINE You do n't remember Uncle Syrus forcing himself on you ? JACKIE Of course , I remember , but I 've tried to put that out of my mind and move forward . CAROLINE Really ? Do you think that maybe all that drinking might have something to do with Uncle Syrus ? JACKIE ( wanting to bargain ) Maybe . Maybe . I 'm going to go back to AA . That 's something I 've been promising myself I would do . Yeah , yeah , that 's one thing I can do . I 'll go to a meeting when I leave here . Is that good , Caroline ? CAROLINE Of course , it 's a good thing . You need help , Jackie . You 've been needing help . JACKIE I said I would go back to AA . CAROLINE I think you need to get into therapy . JACKIE Oh , nooooooo . That 's not for me . CAROLINE That 's your choice . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to . JACKIE I feel like I 'm being railroaded and you 're driving the train . p. 77 CAROLINE I 'm not responsible for how you feel about me anymore . You do n't think you need help , but everything I know about what 's happened to us tells me that we have to break the cycle . JACKIE What cycle ? CAROLINE As hard as it may be to look this thing straight in the eye , the truth is that Uncle Syrus molested you and you molested me . That 's the way the cycle runs . JACKIE You make it sound like that 's the worst thing in the world . CAROLINE How can you not think it 's the worst thing in the world ? That tells me how sick you are , Jackie . And I do n't want the cycle to continue . I do n't want any part of it . JACKIE What are you talking about ? CAROLINE I want to make sure that little Timothy and Jessica will be all right . JACKIE ( crying now ) Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I would never hurt my babies . CAROLINE You hurt me . JACKIE I 'm not altogether sure I did what you said . I remember trying to comfort you . I used to hold you close . I used to rub your back . CAROLINE You did more than that . And you ca n't blame it on liquor . That was before you started with the Vodka . p. 78 JACKIE I do n't know . It was a crazy time . Daddy was mean as a snake . Uncle Syrus was taking what he wanted . Maybe I crossed the line with you . CAROLINE And how would you feel if someone did that to Timothy and Jessica ? JACKIE I 'd break their legs and make them dance . CAROLINE Well then , you understand my concern that nothing happens to my niece and nephew . JACKIE So , what are you going to do ? CAROLINE The question is what are you going to do ? JACKIE The first thing I 'm going to do is say I 'm sorry , Caroline . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then turned my back and think it would n't matter . I 'm sorry . I am so sorry . You have to believe me . CAROLINE ( crying ) I believe you , Jackie . And I forgive you . Everything in my heart tells me to forgive you . Everything Granny Vi and Pop taught me tells me to forgive you . But I ca n't sweep this under the rug . Because tomorrow , I 'll wake up angry . So I know it 's going to take a long time for us to work through this . Maybe the rest of my life . But I am not going to be evil and mean to you . That 's not what Granny Vi would want . p. 79 JACKIE Thank you , Caroline . CAROLINE Let me finish . You 're going go back to AA and you 're going to go every night , just like you used to until the counselors tell you it 's ok to cut back . JACKIE Ok , I said I would and I will . CAROLINE And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACKIE ( sighing ) Ok , Caroline . You win . CAROLINE No , you win . And there 'll be no more talk of moving Pop or selling this house . We 'll take care of him here . It 's nonnegotiable . JACKIE Ok . CAROLINE And finally , you 're going to pray . JACKIE What , like five Our Fathers and five Hail Marys a day , like we did when we went to confession in grade school ? CAROLINE I do n't care how many you say . I 'll let you be the judge , but it had better be enough to keep me from telling Pop and Malcolm . JACKIE That 's blackmail . CAROLINE It 's better than the alternative . JACKIE You 're so cold , Caroline . p. 80 CAROLINE Actually , I 'm thawing out from the big freeze . JACKIE Do you think we 'll be able to get through this ? CAROLINE I hope so , for both of us . Granny Vi wo n't rest in peace if we ca n't get past this . JACKIE What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? CAROLINE I told you , I want you to get help . And then I want to learn to trust you again . I want to be able to love you without looking over my shoulders . I want to get to a place where we are n't hurting each other every time we 're in the same room . Mostly , I want you to love me and know I would never hurt you deliberately . I hope someday soon we can begin again ... start over . That 's what hope is ... the possibility of a new beginning . JACKIE Thank God for hope . CAROLINE Did n't you see the hope in all the stories Pop and Granny Vi told us ? We have something to grab hold of when everything around us is falling apart . Well , I 'm grabbing hold now , and I 'm moving on , Jackie . JACKIE And you 're willing to take me with you ? CAROLINE I 'm certainly not willing to leave you behind . You 're my sister . JACKIE I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go with you to the AA meetings sometimes , if you want me to . JACKIE I 'd like that . CAROLINE You know what else I 'd like ? JACKIE What ? CAROLINE I 'd like a life , and I think I 'd like it with Bill . JACKIE ( pointing a finger ) Girl , I told you he 'd be the one to ring your bell . CAROLINE Yeah , I guess you did . That Mr. Bill is one fine man , and I want him . I really want him . JACKIE Go get him . CAROLINE I intend to . As of this minute , he is no longer my therapist . I 'll choose another psychologist . Tonight I am going out with Bill , the man who makes my heart skip a beat . JACKIE The man who burns your candle . CAROLINE And tomorrow when I wake up ... JACKIE With Bill ? CAROLINE I 'm going out there ... and this time I wo n't be afraid . JACKIE You 're going to kick butt ! CAROLINE I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm ready to move ahead . My feet are n't running anymore . I 'm not stuck . I am free , finally free . ( A knock is heard at the door. ) p. 82 CAROLINE That 's Bill . He told me he was coming over later . I 'm going out to get pizza with him . ( heading to the exit . ) Tell Pop I 'll be in late . JACKIE I 'll stay with him tonight . CAROLINE Good , but do n't wait up . And do n't make a big fuss over Pop . He 's all right . Granny Vi 's been coming to him , too , in his dreams . And his feet are n't stuck anymore either . I had to see it in him before I could see it in myself . We can run , now . You , too , Jackie . JACKIE ( nodding affirmatively ) Caroline , I do love you . CAROLINE I know you do . JACKIE I 'm sorry . I 'm really sorry . I wish I could ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the change . ( JACKIE and CAROLINE embrace CAROLINE exits . JACKIE picks up the handkerchief and cries into it . ) ( GRANNY VI appears . ) GRANNY VI It 'll be all right , Jackleen . Carry-line is going to carry you through . ( singing . ) We 've got the power to heal ourselves . We 've got the power to heal ourselves . Oh , we 've got the power to heal ourselves . JACKIE ( making the sign of the cross . ) We 've got the power to heal ourselves . Oh , we 've got the power to heal ourselves . ( Lights fade to black . ) ( END OF PLAY. )
