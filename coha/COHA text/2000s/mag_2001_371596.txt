For nations at war , technology has always been an unsteady ally . Yes , the Great Wall kept China 's marauders at bay , at least for a while , but all the weaponry America brought to bear on the Vietnamese  --  from napalm to the B-52s  --  could n't win their hearts and minds . In our present war , we will rely more than ever on technology : the clever missiles that target a terrorist leader ; the vaccines that protect against biological weapons ; the lines of code that render a computer impervious to cyberterrorists . As the public debates whether it 's safe to fly again , high-tech innovations promise to do everything from positively identifying passengers at the gate to automatically returning hijacked planes safely to earth . <P> The men and women who dreamed up these technological wonders probably never imagined that civilization would someday rely so heavily on their ingenuity , but heroes rarely become so by their design . There is no guarantee , of course , that their creations will be used wisely or well . At Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Trade Center began their flight , the security codes to Jetway doors were often scribbled in pencil next to the locks . Technology can always be undone by human error . <P> So , give us the gizmos , but grant us the wisdom to know science alone will never make us perfectly secure . <P>  --  By Matthew Cooper
