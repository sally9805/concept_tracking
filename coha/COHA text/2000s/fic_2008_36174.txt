Prologue <p> She was all he desired but everything forbidden . <p> Her appeal was lethal . Her spirited steps , her laughter , each reckless toss of her shiny blond hair struck him like bullets to the heart . She had a way about her . And the body type that never failed to excite him . <p> By daylight she haunted him , materializing like an apparition in the supermarket , at the community center , or walking her dog . As he collected his mail or plucked his paper off the grass , he 'd glimpse her face in a passing car . Wherever he went , she was there . <p> He thought of her the most when he was alone in the dark . <p> Fate was giving him the finger . That he knew . Led into temptation , he resisted . Why complicate his existence in this community of six thousand souls in neat frame houses with maple and pine trees standing like sentinels along streets that all led to nowhere ?

Honking and flying , flying and honking , until all he wanted was to shotgun them out of the goddamn sky . The profound silence when they neither honked nor flew was even worse . He 'd wake up alone in the night convinced he 'd gone deaf in the dark . <p> His passion went unrequited , but he and the object of his attentiondid share rare moments : they nearly collided one Saturday morning as he browsed hangover remedies in an aisle at the Rite Aid Drugstore . Her megawatt smile deepened her killer dimples and crinkled her mischievous blue eyes . She obviously recognized him . <p> He whistled softly through his teeth as he watched her go . " You know what you just did to me , " he whispered . <p> They always knew . <p> He fought his basic instincts , kept his profile low , and stuck to the rules  --  some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin into play . Who could blame him ? Bored to distraction , he missed the money , the sex , the power . Nightlife here revolved around a pizza joint that closed early and monthly church suppers at which participants prayed , no doubt to survive the inedibly gummy spaghetti dinner . <p> Sleepless , he paced his modest middle-class home like a caged and moody lion yearning for his natural habitat , a concrete jungle astir with the wild life and high-risk encounters among the creatures of the night . <p> During a routine physical his new doctor suggested that he smoke less and exercise more . They wo n't be satisfied , he thought bitterly , until I am stripped of every comfort and simple pleasure . Nonetheless , he began a regimen of brisk daily walks . Fresh air and exercise would keep him too busy for unhealthy obsessions . But soon her house became a major landmark on his route . She lived on the far side of a small park surrounding an imposing stone sculpture , a horseman wielding a raised sword . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscription identified the rider : he was General John Stark , who led the New Hampshire Minutemen to battle in the Revolutionary War and coined the state 's motto , Live Free or Die . He studied the horseman 's face and his sword , then checked his watch and quickly moved on . His walks were synchronized with her schedule so he could see what she wore  --  and did n't . How much more smooth , milky skin would she bare as the long , dreary days of winter began to yield to blindingly bright yellow daffodils ? Unlike the stone-faced general , she exuded life and energy . He obsessed over the impatient jut of her hip , her merry laughter , and the graceful curve of her neck , exposed when she pinned her glowing hair back . They all fueled his fantasies . <p> Spontaneous and typically female , she was not always predictable , or inclement weather would intervene . Often he was disappointed , but when she was on her front porch , in the driveway , or her yard , it was worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a look of recognition , then a smile , and most recently , a friendly wave . <p> He responded with a neighborly nod , nothing more . <p> He had been told to make friends . How do you do that in middle age , when all your previous friendships were forged and flourished in childhood ? Friends grow up together , cover each other 's backs , and build alliances through a lifetime of history shared back in the day . <p> An outsider here , he was as disoriented as an alien from a distant planet . He and his new neighbors shared nothing in common . Many seemed short on teeth but still spoke in uppity tones . The women appalled him . Where did they grow these heifers ? Yet the gaggles of runny-nosed kids who trailed behind them were proof that men actually slept with them . Disgusting . So he kept to himself , kept control , held his demons at bay . <p> He did wrestle the devil on occasion . He emerged from the exercise room at the community center one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at the pool , hair wet , skin glistening , a thirsty towel draped around her neck . She giggled with a friend , hunched her slim shoulders , and hugged her arms against a chilly breeze . Teeth chattering , she turned away . <p> He licked his lips and swallowed , close enough to see the gooseflesh rise on the inside of her pale thighs and how the clingy fabric of her wet bikini bottom rode up her crotch . <p> He positioned his exercise bag in front of him to conceal his excitement , catching his breath at the sight of her daintily extended bare leg as she slid gracefully into the car for the ride home . <p> The moment was defining . She saw him watching , he thought , and flaunted herself . Deliberately . Tried to turn him on and succeeded . Females are born knowing how to drive a man crazy . <p> Still , he never would have touched her but destiny intervened . Late one afternoon , as he nodded off in his underwear and socks watching a Yankees game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet , totally awake . <p> Instinctively , he dove for the small silver-colored automatic pistol concealed beneath a sofa cushion . He pressed his thick back to the wall and released the safety . <p> There was a growing chill outside the window and the feel of rain in the air . The streetlights were still dark . Cautiously , from behind the curtains , he squinted into the deepening dusk . <p> When he saw the figure alone in the lengthening shadows , persistently pushing his doorbell , he gasped . Quickly , he scanned the street . Perfect . No traffic in sight . No one watching . <p> " Hold on ! I 'll be right there ! " He snatched his trousers off the back of a chair . <p> He zipped up , fingers fumbling as he fastened his belt , afraid she might leave . <p> He checked the window again before unlocking the door . Nothing had changed . She still stood there alone . He could scarcely believe his good fortune .
