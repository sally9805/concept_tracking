PLACES IN THE WEST Headnote Fix up a classic house , fix up a great city-that 's what Pasadenans do Photograph Todd Ellis and Michele Carnes Ellis work on their 1909 Craftsman home in Pasadena 's Orange Heights . Far left : the Colorado Street Bridge . // Just inside Pasadena 's city limits , Colorado Boulevard opens up as it reaches the Arroyo seco . There , a curving quarter-mile bridge crosses the gorge , its roadbed hanging 150 feet above the canyon . The old Vista del Arroyo hotel , now a courthouse , looms like a sentry tower guarding the city . The San Gabriel Mountains , topped with snow , form a surprisingly wintry backdrop . This is the classic view of Pasadena : The arroyo is the city 's symbolic heart and the center of the Arts and Crafts tradition that arose in Pasadena a century ago . Architectural historian and Pasadena resident Robert Winter says the bridge enhances the arroyo 's beauty by bringing together the manmade and the natural worlds . " The bridge almost completes the place , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to tear it down to save it . " Once closed because of seismic concerns , the 1913 bridge underwent a complex restoration in the 1990s . Each summer thousands of people from the city 's diverse neighborhoods converge on the bridge during a festival celebrating its survival . The bridge is an artistic triumph , but in its day its striking , curvilinear design was revolutionary too . It was the tallest of its kind at the time , modern , yet with a grandeur to rival the Old World structures that inspired it . In this way , the bridge embodies Pasadena 's reverence for its past and the inventive , progressive spirit that has long been part of the city 's life . It 's a rich legacy but also an ongoing challenge : Can a city be both a storehouse of history and a hothouse for new ideas ?

Opposite : Art Center College of Design 's South Campus . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arroyo , is the city 's best-known Arts and Crafts landmark , the style also became popular in middleclass areas . To this day , Pasadena neighborhoods of all income levels are filled with vintage Craftsman homes . Beneath the city 's dense urban forest , low walls of Arroyo seco stone and clinker brick front brown-shingled homes with porches set under graceful overhangs . And although Pasadena 's best-known parade is the Tournament of Roses , each day in these communities a far less formal procession takes place-baby strollers , bicyclists , walkers , and runners . Neighbors greeting neighbors . There 's a deep appreciation for these houses ' design and the philosophy they express : The Craftsman ethos emphasized the handmade and personally inspired in a time of increased mechanization . It 's an ideal that certainly resonates during our cyber era of reality 2.0 . " When we discovered Craftsman homes , we knew that this was our architecture . It said home to us , " says Patty Judy , who for four years has lived with husband Juan de la Cruz in a f911 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the simplicity and functionality , the grounding to nature . Because of the natural woods and the big windows , the house seems like it 's almost growing from the earth . " Architectural historian Robert Winter resides in one of Pasadena 's most significant Craftsman structures , the onetime home of renowned tile maker Ernest Batchelder . Strangers sometimes appear at Winter 's door with Batchelder tiles ; they invariably declare that they want to return the pieces to their proper home . With a grandfather who sold furniture by Craftsman icon Gustav Stickley , Winter is to the Craftsman born . He 's also an avowed modernist , so while Winter admires Craftsman warmth and workmanship , he 's less reverential than those Pasadena residents who practically revert to hushed tones as they speak of Greene and Greene . Winter recalls observing a carpenter restore built-in drawers in a Greene and Greene house . The drawers functioned exquisitely . But the bemused carpenter said a far less complicated scheme would have worked equally well . " All ofthat work ! It 's kind of funny , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But they knocked themselves out . " The Greenes set a lofty standard , and Pasadena residents are still knocking themselves out as they restore their homes . Todd Ellis , a filmindustry propmaster , and wife Michle Games Ellis have spent six years working on a two-story f 909 house in the city 's Orange Heights neighborhood . " It has been tons of work , almost nonstop . A complete resurrection , " says Todd . " There are old wood floors and stairs that creak . We had to do all new wiring , reroof , and put on handmade red-cedar shingles . But we love it . It 's like a big cabin in the woods . " Restoration , says Todd , promotes community as residents share insight , tips , and resources : Architecture and design provide a common bond . " People who like old houses are into a particular vibe . More Americana , " says Todd . " It gets carried over into what you do . We sit out on our porch on hot evenings and see our neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bizarre kind of way . " In the hills along the upper arroyo , there 's another famous bridge . This glass-and-steel design by Graig Ellwood Associates is as stark and modern as the Colorado Street Bridge is romantic . Since 1976 , it has housed classrooms , studios , and offices for the Hillside Campus of Art Center College of Design , one of the country 's leading institutions for automotive design , among 11 other disciplines . Along with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology , where Albert Einstein worked in the early 1930s , Art Center adds a forward-thinking dimension to the city 's cultural life . Its new South Campus has converted an old aerospace plant into a 100,000square-foot facility , notable for its dramatic skylights , sculptural staircase , and a gallery housed in the factory 's old wind tunnel . The reminders of the city 's rich legacy of invention are everywhere , whether you 're walking in Einstein 's steps through a CalTech courtyard or catching a glimpse of Frank Lloyd Wright 's La Miniatura hidden in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas and culture , where neighbors come together at a world-class museum like the Norton Simon , at the venerable Pasadena Playhouse theater , and in bookstores , most notably the 111-year-old Vroman 's Bookstore . That said , today 's Pasadena is not without its divides , whether economic , cultural , or simply physical-such as Interstate 210 , which roughly cuts the city in half . Photograph Pasadena pleasures ( from top ) : by the Rose Bowl ; the Gamble House ; bungalows ; and downtown 's Castle Green . Opposite : Art Center College of Design 's South Campus . // One of the key challenges facing Pasadena is figuring out how to promote the city 's highest ideals and make them accessible and real for the entire community . That effort is taking many forms . After losing its previous space , the innovative Furious Theatre Company found a new home when the Pasadena Playhouse reached out and offered use of its Balcony Theater . Side Street Projects , an arts organization , has worked with more than 1,000 artists to help them both thrive creatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to its community of working artists . The organization also extends a hand to kids with a program called Alternate Routes , in which colorful buses equipped with workbenches are sent into city neighborhoods to teach children the basics of woodworking . Greene and Greene would no doubt approve .

It 's unpretentious , warm , and inviting-Pasadena through and through . Not long ago , however , it was a crack house , ready to be sold for its land value and set to be replaced by apartments . The house was refurbished through the organization 's Heritage Housing Partners . The program provides city-backed financial assistance to first-time homebuyers with modest incomes who agree to protect the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us this property , " says Mossman . " We put $25,000 into its restoration and sold it to a neighborhood family . The house has helped change this end of the street . " Since 1977 Pasadena Heritage has fought to make sure the city does n't forget its luminous past . Its victories include saving the Colorado Street Bridge and protecting historic buildings in Old Pasadena ; the district has evolved into Southern California 's most appealing retail center . But the organization is also using preservation as a tool to enhance neighborhood life . Says Mossman , " Saving houses and protecting the community are part of the same effort . " In a region where sprawl has created poorly planned , faceless neighborhoods , there 's a hunger for an alternative . That craving is born of a desire to recapture a community ideal that seems to be slipping away . Pasadena is less an exercise in nostalgia than about being a bridge between the past and what is to come . And in the finest Craftsman tradition , it all begins at home . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Bungalow Heaven resident Patty Judy . " There 's a spirit to our house , and not in some ghostly way . My husband put together a list of the people who have lived here . This house was a place of protection , a place that helped them , just as it is for us . We know we 're part of a long line of people who have lived in this house . Now we 're the ones taking care of it . " Best of Pasadena , old and new Pasadena is about 10 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles .
