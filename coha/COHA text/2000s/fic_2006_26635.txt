Septimus Heap , Book One : Magyk Chapter One Something in the Snow Silas Heap pulled his cloak tightly around him against the snow . It had been a long walk through the Forest , and he was chilled to the bone . But in his pockets he had the herbs that Galen , the Physik Woman , had given him for his new baby boy , Septimus , who had been born earlier that day . Silas drew closer to the Castle , and he could see the lights flickering through the trees as candles were placed in the windows of the tall narrow houses clustered along the outside walls . It was the longest night of the year , and the candles would be kept burning until dawn , to help keep the dark at bay . Silas always loved this walk to the Castle . He had no fear of the Forest by day and enjoyed the peaceful walk along the narrow track that threaded its way through the dense trees for mile after mile . He was near the edge of the Forest now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the track began to dip down to the valley floor , Silas could see the whole Castle spread before him . The old walls hugged the wide , winding river and zigzagged around the higgledy-piggledy clumps of houses . All the houses were painted bright colors , and those that faced west looked as if they were on fire as their windows caught the last of the winter sun 's rays . The Castle had started life as a small village . Being so near to the Forest the villagers had put up some tall stone walls for protection against the wolverines , witches and warlocks who thought nothing of stealing their sheep , chickens and occasionally their children . As more houses were built , the walls were extended and a deep moat was dug so that all could feel safe . Soon the Castle was attracting skilled craftsmen from other villages . It grew and prospered , so much so that the inhabitants began to run out of space until someone decided to build The Ramblings . The Ramblings , which was where Silas , Sarah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rose up along the riverside . I t sprawled for three miles along the river and back again into the caste , and was a noisy , busy place filled with a warren of passages and rooms , with small factories , schools and shops mixed in with family rooms , tiny roof garens and even a theater . There was not much space in The Ramblings but people did not mind . There was always good company and someone for the children to play with . As the winter sun sank below the Castle walls , Silas quickened his pace . He needed to get to the North Gate before they locked it an pulled up the drawbridge at nightfall . It was then that Silas sensed something nearby . Something alive , but only just . He was aware of a small human heartbeat somewhere close to him . Silas stopped . As an Ordinary Wizard he was able to sense things , but , as he was not a particularly good Ordinary Wizard , he needed to concentrate hard . He stood still with the snow falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he heard somethinga snuffle , a whimper , a small breath ? He was n't sure , but it was enough . Underneath a bush beside the path was a bundle . Silas picked up the bundle and , to his amazement , found himself gazing into the solemn eyes of a tiny baby . Silas cradled the baby in his arms and wondered how she had come to be lying in the snow on the coldest day of the year . Someone had wrapped her tightly in a heavy woolen blanket , but she was already very cold : her lips were a dusky blue and the snow dusted her eyelashes . As the baby 's dark violet eyes gazed intently at him , Silas had the uncomfortable feeling that she had already seen things in her short life that no baby should see . Thinking of his Sarah at home , warm and safe with Septimus and the boys , Silas decided that they would just have to make room for one more little one . He carefully tucked the baby into his blue Wizard cloak and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate . He reached the drawbridge just as Gringe , the gatekeeper , was about to go and yell for the Bridge Boy to start winding it up . " You 're cutting it a bit fine , " growled Gringe . " But you Wizards are weird . Waddyou all want to be out for on a day like this I du n no . " " Oh ? " Silas wanted to get past Gringe as soon as he could , but first he had to cross Gringe 's palm with silver . Silas quickly found a silver penny in one of his pockets and handed it over . " Thank you , Gringe . Good night . " Gringe looked at the the penny as though it were a rather nasty beetle . " Marcia Overstrand , she gave me a alf crown just now . But then she 's got class , what with er being the ExtraOrdinary Wizard now . " " What ? " Silas nearly choked . " Yeah . Class , that 's what she 's got . " Gringe stood back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as Silas wanted to find out why Marcia Overstrand was suddenly the ExtraOrdinary Wizard , he could feel the bundle beginning to stir in the warmth of his cloak , and something told him that it would be better if Gringe did not know about the baby . As Silas disappeared into the shadows of the tunnel that led to The Ramblings , a tall figure in purple stepped out and barred his way . " Marcia ! " gasped Silas . " What on earth " " Tell no one you found her . She was born to you . Understand ? " Shocked , Silas nodded . Before he had time to say anything , Marcia was gone in a shimmer of purple mist . Silas spent the rest of the long winding journey through The Ramblings with his mind in turmoil . Who was this baby ? What did Marcia have to do with her ? And why was Marcia the ExtraOrdinary Wizard now ? And as a Silas neared the big red door that led to the Heap family 's already overcrowded room , another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah going to say to yet another baby to care for ? Silas did not have long to think about the last question . As he reached the door it flew open , and a large red-faced woman wearing the dark blue robes of a Matron Midwife ran out , almost knocking Silas over as she fled . She too was carrying a bundle , but the bundle was wrapped from head to toe in bandages , and she was carrying him under her arm as if he were a parcel and she was late for the post . " Dead ! " cried the Matron Midwife . She pushed Silas aside with a powerful shove and ran down the corridor . Inside the room , Sarah Heap screamed . Silas went in with a heavy heart . He saw Sarah surrounded by six white-faced little boys , all too scared to cry . " She 's taken him , " said Sarah hopelessly . " Septimus is dead , and she 's taken him away . " At that moment a warm wetness spread out from the bundle that Silas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words for what he wanted to say , so he just took the bundle out from under his cloak and placed her in Sarah 's arms . Sarah heap burst into tears .
