Chapter 5 " Look , " Bea said , holding up her stuffed animal . It was Saturday morning and she was sitting on Adam 's bed . " Bear says good morning to Adam . " Bea was still in her nightgown . She slept in an alcove in a corner of their parents ' room . Adam 's room was off the kitchen . The model planes he 'd built hung from the ceiling . They were never still . Bea pushed her teddy bear in his face . " Bear says time to kiss . " Adam put down the model plane he 'd been maneuvering and gave Bear an extra-loud kiss . " Stop it . " She pinched his nose . " Do you want to play ? " " Surely , little girl . " He gave her his newest Japanese fighter plane . " It 's called a Zero , and this game is called dogfight . " " I do n't like dogs who fight . " " It 's not dogs fighting , it 's planes fighting each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the way we play . You 're high , against the sun , so I ca n't see you till the last second , and you come out of the sun , shooting down at me . " " You do n't shoot your brother . " " It 's only a game . " He moved her arm so her plane was above his . " Make believe you 're going to shoot me . " " I can do it , " she said , pushing his hand away . " You do n't have to show me . Bap ! Bap ! Bap ! " " Good ! See how you 're behind me , on my tail ? It looks bad for me , but watch this . " He sent his navy Corsair into a rolling dive and came back up under the Zero . " You see that ? I just blew your plane into a thousand pieces . " " You did not . " Bea held her plane up triumphantly . " See , you missed me . " " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Punchbowl ? " " Where we live . " " Do you know it 's a dead " " Volcano ! I know that already . " " Do you know that Hawaii is built on all dead volcanoes that came out of the ocean ? " " You told me . " She yawned , patting her mouth . " That is so boring . " He picked up another model plane with square-tipped wings . " What 's this plane called ? " " I do n't know . No fair . " " Grumman Wildcat . It 's the navy fighter plane . And this one here , next to it , is a P-40 Curtiss Warhawk . It 's the army fighter , and this one 's a German Messerschmitt Me 109 . " " Which plane is the best ? " " The American planes are always the best . " " We always win , " Bea said . " Hello ... " Their mother looked in . " Anybody home ? It 's time for breakfast . " " We 're playing dogfight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bap ! I won , Mommy . " " Is it really time for breakfast , Mom ? " Adam asked . " It 's almost time for lunch , kiddo . Let 's clear the decks and get this bunk ready for inspection . " When his father was home , their house was a ship . The floors were decks , beds were bunks , windows were portholes , the kitchen was the galley , and if Adam said " bathroom , " his father said , " I think you mean the head . " " Your father sees this mess , you 're in for a lecture , " his mother said . " And maybe a sock on the behind , " Bea said . " And you 're going to cry and cry . " " Let me remind you , little girl , " Adam said , " boys do n't cry . " He lifted her off his bunk , then made it navy style , by the book , everything taut , hospital corners , no wrinkles . His father was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was their regular Saturday-morning ritual , whether his father was here or not . When he was ready , he called her , then stood by the door . His mother did a tough inspection . There was always some place he 'd forgotten to dust . It was the shelf in the closet this time . When his father did the inspection , he 'd bounce a quarter on the bunk and if it did n't bounce high enough for him to catch , Adam would have to tear the bunk apart and make it over again . After his mother had finished the inspection and he had wiped the shelf , she interrogated him exactly as his father did , even deepening her voice . " Do you appreciate that you have a room of your own , sailor ? " " Yes , sir , I do ! " " I did n't have a room of my own when I was a boy , sailor . " " No , sir , I know that . " His mother stood at attention . She enjoyed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Christmas was a pair of itchy red socks . No model airplanes , no Raleigh racers . " " No , sir , " he said . " I know that , sir ! " " Are you thankful for what you have ? " " Yes , sir , I am . I know that I 'm one fortunate son of a gun . And I have to give back , I know that , too . Yes , sir , I am a grateful boy . " " Are you mocking me , sailor ? " " Yes , sir ! " " That 's going to get you six months of KP , sailor . " In the kitchen a few minutes later , his mother put the yellow cornflakes box on the table with a bowl and a banana . Bea was on the floor playing with Bear . " I want Jell-O , please , " she said . Koniko , their Japanese maid , did n't work on the weekends , although she 'd be in later to baby-sit Bea . Adam and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banana . " What was Dad like when he was my age , Mom ? " " He was a farm boy , and he had to work terribly , terribly hard . If there was work to be done , he got up at five every morning before school . A lot of times he never made it to school . He was the oldest , and your grandpa needed him on the farm . Grandpa could n't do a lot with just one arm . " Adam 's grandfather Pelko had lost an arm in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I. That arm ended just below the elbow . He usually kept a sock over the stump . He could always make Adam jump by wriggling the bare stump in his face . " Dad ran away from home , did n't he ? " Adam knew the answer , but this was the thing about his father that most fascinated him . His father , so disciplined , so regular , so sober , was once free enough or wild enough that he left his family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's age . He had thought about that a lot . That was really brave . His mother emptied the contents of a Jell-O package into a bowl . " Your father ran away , but he was n't a bad kid . He joined the navy " " And lied about his age , " Adam said . " Your father does n't lie ! I do n't like the way you said that , Adam . " " Sorry , " he said . She poured boiling water over the Jell-O . " It was n't the same as real lying . He wanted the navy . He needed a home . Sometimes life forces you to do things . We do n't know how hard his life was , Adam . We ca n't even imagine it . He had to work like a man from the time he was eight years old . You will never have to make the choices he did . " She stirred the Jell-O . " And what he 's accomplished , the position of trust and authority that he 's risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself . He came up from nothing . Your father I have to say it your father is an admirable man . Really , a great man . " " Maybe he 'll be admirable of the fleet someday . " A flip remark . It just sprang out of his mouth . He really agreed with his mother , his father was admirable , but there was something about his being so admirable that , well , scared Adam . Would he ever be capable of doing what his father did ? Could he ever be even half the man his father was ? If his mother caught the admirable pun , she did n't let on . " There might be a war , " she said . She refilled the teakettle . " War with Japan ? " he asked . " Yes . " She sighed . " Nobody wants it , but " " Dad wants it . " " What do you mean ' Dad wants it ' ? What kind of thing is that to say , Adam ? " " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the training exercises are about . Do n't worry , we 're ready for them . " " Ready is one thing , war is something else . " " You do n't have to worry , Mom . There 's nothing safer than a battleship . If war comes , Dad 's going to be okay . " He made his hand into a gun . War was exciting . It was action . It was ships , planes , and guns . It was being faster and smarter than your enemy . It was defending your country . " Dad says all that talk in Washington is a waste of time . The Japs want to push us out of the Pacific , but if they try , we 're going to knock their heads off . " " Do n't say ' Jap , ' " his mother said . " It 's vulgar . " " Sorry , Mom . " He put his bowl in the sink . He just hoped that if war came , it would n't be over too soon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get me some papayas first , " his mother said . He stepped out into the garden . The grass was wet and tickled his bare feet . It was December , and there were flowers in the bushes and bird sounds in the air , and everywhere there was the smell of summer . A big , ugly toad sat under the papaya tree . Adam inched his foot toward it . " Buffo , " he said , and it jumped away . He picked a few papayas and brought them in to his mother . " I 'll be back at 1800 . " " Where are you going ? " Where was he going ? He did n't know . " I 'm just going to poke around . " " Be home on time . You know your father . " " Do n't worry , Mom , I 'll be here . "
