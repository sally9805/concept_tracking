Section : Hands On global entrepreneur Henry Estate 's push into China flopped  --  until it learned that exporting means more than just translating the words on a label <p> THERE ARE 1.3 billion potential wine drinkers in China , and Scott Henry , owner of Henry Estate , a winery in Umpqua , Oreg. , was convinced they 'd love his pinot noir . Henry understood that Western-style wine is a relatively new phenomenon in China , but he also believed that his wine 's taste and texture were a perfect match for Chinese cuisine . <p> Henry Estate is no stranger to exporting . For the past 10 years it has shipped cases to Canada , the U.K. , and Japan . How much harder could it be to add China to the list ? So last fall , Doyle Hinman , the winery 's marketing director , had some marketing materials translated into Mandarin , slapped some Chinese-language labels on the bottles , and found a distributor , Portland , Oreg. - based American Pacific , with contacts in the country . Soon , 700 cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were prepared for the wine to explode " says Henry . " We were set to handle a demand of 500 cases a month . " <p> But four months later , most of that wine was still on the shelves in Chinese stores . Hinman and American Pacific 's Terry Protto hopped on a plane to investigate and were stunned by what they found . No one in China , not the local distributors , the retailers , or consumers , seemed to know the first thing about red wine . For one thing , the wine , which retails for $62 a bottle , was being sold in the equivalent of convenience stores . Bottles were being delivered on the backs of motorcycles and were often left sitting in the sun for hours . " I thought some things about wine were just known , " Hinman says . " Not there . " <p> With scores of U.S. and European wineries jockeying for position in the Chinese market , Hinman thought that just getting his product to market would be the most critical hurdle . But globalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a lot more complicated than that . " When you introduce a new product overseas , no matter what it is , you have to go through a process we call localizing the brand , " says Chanin Balance , CEO and founder of ViaLanguage , a translation firm based in Portland , Oreg . " You have to introduce it in a way that is congruent with the culture . " <p> Having botched their first impression , Henry Estate and American Pacific  --  which formed a partnership to tap the Chinese market  --  were determined that their second be more successful . " Our mantra , " says Protto , " was ' Assume nothing . ' " The first move was to get a better understanding of who their customers were and how to get the wine in their hands . Protto tapped one of his Chinese associates , who began canvassing government officials , young banking and finance executives , owners of chic restaurants and bars , Western expatriates  --  anyone who seemed likely to be a wine drinker . He discovered that Chinese buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are in the way it tastes . He also learned that the government-controlled Chinese Central Television network had launched a series of ads touting the health benefits of drinking red wine  --  which could provide a nice marketing bounce . <p> The Henry Estate team did n't waste a minute . They abandoned the small retail stores and used their Chinese connections to get the wine on menus at upscale hotels and restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai . Protto , who is fluent in Mandarin , gave tutorials to waiters , showing them how to pair pinot noir with food and laying out an incentive plan to encourage servers to recommend Henry Estate . Turning their attention to merchandising , they began packaging individual bottles and pairs of bottles in a rustic wooden box , with " Oregon Pinot Noir " stenciled on the side , along with a pair of wineglasses . Hanging around the bottle 's neck was an 18-minute DVD demonstrating how the wine is produced and how it should be consumed . " Chinese customers would often whip out their mini-DVD players and watch the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Henry Estate and American Pacific have spent about $250,000 on such efforts  --  plus about $5,000 in financial assistance under a Department of Agriculture program designed to stem the trade deficit by spurring exports . The campaign is beginning to pay off . Two high-end Chinese supermarket chains , with more than 2,000 stores each , are sending representatives to visit Henry Estate this winter . The winery is also negotiating with Disneyland Hong Kong , which is considering adding Henry Estate 's vintages to several restaurants ' wine lists . Meanwhile , the winery 's second shipment  --  of about 600 cases  --  is scheduled for the end of the year . " It 's an untapped market over there , " Henry says , " and we 've been able to build a solid foundation .
