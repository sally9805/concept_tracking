The J.A.P. Chronicles By Isabel Rose Random House Isabel Rose Back to Willow Lake " Is this about religion ? " Renny asked . Ali looked up from the New York Times and said , " It has nothing to do with religion , and you know that . " " Because I 'll convert if it 's that damn important to you , " Renny persisted . His large frame filled the door to the kitchen , cutting off Ali 's escape route . She thought the conversation had concluded when they came in from their early-morning walk through Chinatown . " When have I ever gone to temple since you 've known me ? " she asked . Some crumbs from her apple Danish rested on the table next to the newspaper . She wiped them into her hand and popped them into her mouth . " You can take the Jew out of temple , but you ca n't take the Jew out of the girl , " Renny replied . He did n't sound sarcastic . " Oh , and Catholicism just disappears once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scar that ran through Renny 's left eyebrow crinkled in irritation . " This is no time to act all cutesy or belligerent , or even cutesy belligerent . Catholicism plays no role in my life whatsoever . I have n't stepped foot in a church since I ca n't even remember when . " " It was last summer , when we went to your friend 's wedding in Yonkers and the mass lasted an hour and a half and it was un-air-conditioned and that woman in the hat fainted . " " Well , do n't blame me , " Renny said . " It was n't a reflection of my religious affiliation . And please do n't tell me you 've suddenly started making judgments about the variety of my friends , because then I actually would n't want to marry you . I would n't even want to know you . " Ali went to the refrigerator and took out a carton of milk . It was always a careful balance with Renny . So gentle and good-natured on the surface , he 'd retreat into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She decided to keep it light . " I think it 's very generous of you to consider converting " - she paused to take a swig of milk- " but if you did , we 'd never have any more children , because we 'd never have sex again , because I 've never once in my life been attracted to a nice Jewish boy . " She took another swig and put the carton back . Renny was n't amused by any of it . " Come on , " she cajoled , " if you converted , our relationship would stop shocking my sisters , and shocking them is one of the great pleasures of my life . You would n't want to deprive me of one of my greatest pleasures , would you ? " Renny stared at her , the expression in his dark eyes flat . Then he said , " At the end of the day , you 're exactly like them . " " Sticks and stones , " Ali quipped , hoping he 'd drop it . " Sticks and stones , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway where her suitcase sat . " I just do n't understand what you 're waiting for . " He followed her to the front door of the ground-floor apartment on Norfolk Street they had shared for the last two years . " I 'm ready . You 're ready . We 're ready . " " You know what I 'm ready for ? " Ali did an abrupt 180 . " I 'm ready for one more apple Danish ! " She gave Renny a peck on the cheek and returned to the kitchen . She did n't really want the Danish , but they 'd been through the same conversation over and over and Ali could n't stand to go through it yet again , especially when she was already running so late . The pastry wrapped in a napkin , she headed for the door . " At least let me help you with your bag , " Renny said , picking up her small valise . " Not bad for a J.A.P. " He winked as she passed .

" He kissed the top of her head , her forehead , her cheek , her neck . He smelled like sweat and Tide . He smelled like comfort . " Call me when you get to the market . " She forced herself to pull away . " I feel like I might want you to pick something crazy up for me , but I ca n't tell what it is yet . " " Do you really have to go ? " Renny looked so sincerely pained , it melted the all-business igloo Ali had put herself in . " I do n't like the idea of your traveling right now . Did n't you say you felt some cramping last night ? " " Nothing 's going to happen to me , " Ali reassured him , even though no one had had faith in reassurance since September 11 , when every New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm only doing a two-day shoot . Let 's just be glad it 's paying so well . " Renny looked away . Ali knew she had touched a nerve , and she tried hard to soothe it . " Do n't you want to start filming our Bosnian refugee project ? " She caressed the side of his face . He had n't shaved this morning , and the stubble tickled her fingers . " This 'll fund it and another one . I 'm not trying to be a downer , but things are about to get a lot more expensive . It 's not like I 'll be able to breast-feed forever . And then there 's sitters and clothes and play groups- " " And a wedding . " " And a new apartment . Did you hear those guys last night outside our window ? It was insane how loud they were , which I would n't have minded as much if I 'd understood them , but my teachers definitely never taught us those words in my high school Spanish classes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renny said . After fifteen years on film sets , Renny could sleep through anything and at any hour . The morning Renny and Ali got together , they were on their way home from a shoot that had started at 6:00 p.m. and ended at 4:00 a.m . Renny had been called in to sub for Ali 's usual cinematographer , who had had to leave unexpectedly due to a death in his family , and the two had struck up a conversation on the drive back into the city from Newark , where they had been filming teenage prostitutes . When Renny had arrived that night for work , Ali had seen only a tall , willowy guy with curly black hair cascading over slightly slumped shoulders that looked like they could n't possibly handle the weight of a camera . It was n't until much later that she noticed his hands , large and white , with bitten nails and ragged cuticles but with long fingers that fluttered gracefully in the air when he was trying to make a point or explain a camera angle he thought would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from afar looked almost menacing , but up close it was obvious that his large brown eyes were gentle and perceptive and his pockets contained nothing more harmful than soy nuts , which he liked to snack on instead of " the toxic crap on the craft services table . " Ali found this out in the car ride home when she mentioned that she was starving . " Open your mouth , " he had said . Then he placed the nuts , one by one , onto her tongue . " Yummy , " she said after she had swallowed . Her eyes never once left his . " How 'd you get the scar ? " she had asked . " Chasing after Marlene Fitzpatrick after Sunday school when we were both eight . Always have had a weakness for smart , attractive brunettes . " Neither of them had slept that morning . First they ate pancakes and eggs at an all-night diner on Delancey . Then they went back to his place because it was closer than her apartment in the East Village . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with slow , exhilarating skill , his lips finding places even she did n't know could be kissed ; then they slept until four , ate again , and went back to work , a schedule they kept up until the shoot ended ten days later , by which time they were inseparable . They had decided to move in after two months , less as an expression of their mutual devotion than a necessity if they were ever going to see each other . Renny was on another shoot by then and Ali had her days free . And so it went , with one or the other always working , sometimes on the same projects , more often not . It was an odd life , but somehow they made it work , especially because they both understood the demands of each other 's schedules ; and then there was the incontrovertible fact that they truly hungered for each other , not just physically but emotionally and intellectually , as well . Good thing , that insatiable chemistry . They 'd need it through the hard times to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would shoot in Manhattan after September 11 ? How could they have imagined the independent-film world would come to such a halt ? Of course it was only temporary , but it was a tough temporary , and Renny was working more parties these days as a bartender than he was working on films . Lately , he 'd been looking for television and video work , which was lucrative but always made him feel like a sellout when he came home . He was even contemplating doing weddings and Bar Mitzvahs . " I 've got to get to the plane , " Ali said , taking a step toward the taxi . " Please , " Renny begged , his hand catching her arm . " Think about it . You 're hurting both of us right now . It does n't have to be any big deal . We can hop down to City Hall one morning , or go to Vegas . " " Sounds classy , " Ali said . " Or we can do something big . " Renny took his hand away in irritation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want , hon. I 'm sure your mother would love to throw one last extravaganza . You do n't have to be afraid . Being my wife " - his tone suddenly shifted- " well , I do n't want to convince you to do it . " He started to walk away , muttering , " This is sick . " " Come on , " Ali said , caressing his cheek . " I do n't want to get on a plane with any tension between us . " She gave him a kiss on the mouth , which he returned . " But right now I got ta go . I 'm already late , and you know how my sisters get . " She blew Renny one last kiss , tumbled into the cab , and told the driver to hustle . * * * " So glad you decided to join us , " Robin said when Ali arrived at Teterboro Airport forty-five minutes later . Robin was her oldest sister and usually launched the attack . " You could have called , " Andrea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put purple in your hair for the occasion ? " Mara said . " It 's not even one of the team colors . " Karen got the last word , saying , " Lose the nose ring , Ali . We 're not going to India . " " Nice to see you all , too , " Ali said , laughing to herself at the uniformity of her sisters ' appearance . It was n't just their outfits , which were all similar versions of a floral miniskirt and pastel-colored tank top . They could have all been dressed head to toe in different national costumes and they still would have looked the same , since they each shared their mother 's frizzy brown hair , their father 's brown almond-shaped eyes , and each had had her nose done by the same doctor ( a sweet sixteen " gift " from their parents , which Ali , to her sisters ' disbelief , had resolutely turned down ) . Sure , Robin had the biggest breasts and Mara had recently added Japanese hair straightening to her list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as an eagle 's talons and Karen had a mole above her lip that made people liken her to Cindy Crawford . Beyond that , they were more or less interchangeable . " What 's wrong with my nose ring ? " Ali said to Karen . " You 're just jealous because my diamond 's bigger than yours . " Of course it was n't . No nose could possibly support the weight of a rock that was bigger than Karen 's . Still , Ali chuckled to herself as she followed her sisters up the stairs and into the Learjet 35 . " You redecorated ! " Mara shouted . " Uch , it 's awesome . I love the chenille . " " This must have cost a mint , " Andrea said , running her hands along the holly inlay in the mahogany walls . " It was n't prohibitive . " Robin winked . " I just felt like the gray was too sterile . " " The pink is much better , " Karen agreed . " Please . We call it salmon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's not forget-technically , this is his corporate jet . " Ali took the plush pink seat closest to the bathroom , just in case she got sick , and pulled out her notebook . She had n't prepared at all for the shoot she had been hired to do , and she wanted to write out a few ideas about how to structure the documentary . She was n't worried . It was n't much of a challenge , this job ; nothing like her usual trek through urban jungles and juvenile detention centers . All she really needed to make was a commercial-an hour-long promo attesting to the wonders of Willow Lake . That was all Faye and Ron Stein , the current camp owners , wanted . They just liked the word documentary because they thought it sounded important . But they did n't really want a documentary . Otherwise , they would have asked her to incorporate footage and do research , express a point of view even , which , given Ali 's history , could only have been mixed at best , scathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us commemorate Willow Lake 's centennial " was all they had specified . It was ironic that they 'd come to her . She and her sisters had all gone to the camp when it was run by June Simon , an elegant grandmotherly type who always wore pristine white pants , pristine white Tretorns , pastel-colored button-down shirts , and a matching neckerchief and spent her days wandering around campus in a golf cart , reminding the girls , " Always be a lady . " It was Aunt June , as the girls called her , who had first likened the Cohen sisters to the Kennedys ; Aunt June who had said she had never known a family of such outstanding young ladies ; Aunt June who had bestowed the Spirit of Willow Lake award on each one of the Cohen sisters , one after the other . Of course , Ali had never won the award , but Faye and Ron did n't seem to know that . As usual , she had been lumped in with her sisters , who now had their own children attending Willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their legacy continued . The whole thing was vile , but with a baby on the way and Renny unemployed , really this trip back to camp was just a job . That 's all it was . She 'd film the reunion guests as they went about their activities , give a little history about Willow Lake , conduct a few interviews , shoot the lake in the morning as the sun came up , and again in the evening with the moon shining down on the waves , put it all together , and send it off . As she scribbled down the idea about the lake , Karen asked what she was doing . &lt; Continues ...
