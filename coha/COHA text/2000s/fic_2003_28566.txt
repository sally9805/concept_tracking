Chapter One When Cole Travis first drove into the town of Valle Verde , he felt like he 'd taken a step back in time . There were no sidewalks flanking what appeared to be the main street , just well-traveled dirt paths with weeds and wildflowers growing as best they could in tufts alongside it . A group of young boys walked together , pushing each other and talking and laughing loud enough for Cole to hear them through the open window of his truck . A woman pushed a baby stroller with grocery bags piled in the bottom and a few men sat outside the hardware store . It was quiet and peaceful and kind of pretty . And it made him feel like he was the only person within a hundred miles who had a problem . He pulled up beside the gas pumps at an old-fashioned filling station , turned the key and waited for the groaning , wheezing pile of bolts and sheet metal that was posing as a truck to shudder and rattle to a stop . Cole had purchased the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks earlier and the man had laughingly called its idiosyncrasies " features . " One very special feature , he 'd said , was that the truck did n't stop until it felt like it . Cole sighed . Because he intended to be flying home at the end of this journey , he 'd wanted a vehicle he could junk when the time came . And he 'd certainly gotten what he asked for in this jalopy . Just then , another image out of the past appeared at Cole 's window . A gas station attendant . " Fill ' er up ? " the young man asked . " Sure . " Cole opened the door with a loud creak and stepped onto the clean pavement . " You know where I can get a local paper ? " The boy jerked his head toward the office . " You can take mine . I 'm done with it . It 's on the desk . " Cole took his time walking to the office . He 'd been cramped up in the truck for most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego . Unfortunately , he had n't found what he was looking for in San Clemente , nor had he found it in Laguna Beach before that . But it did n't really matter because regardless of how long it took or what he had to do , he was going to find his son , take him home and try as hard as he could to make up for all the time they 'd lost . As he gathered up the newspaper , he saw a map of Valle Verde thumbtacked to the wall . He pulled a piece of paper out of his back pocket and checked the address of the place he needed to go , located it on the map , then headed back to the truck . After he paid for the gas , he pulled back out onto the main road . Well , at least now he knew where to find them . Only one small detail remained : how to approach them so they would n't suspect his real motive , so they would n't know that he might change their lives forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right side of the road and Cole pulled into it and turned off the truck , then reached into his bag and pulled out five thick file folders that represented his private investigator 's work . They felt heavy in his hands . He 'd had five chances to find his child . Three remained . As he opened the top folder , his gut churned with anger at his ex-wife . In fact , ever since he 'd learned that Kelly had been pregnant with his son when she 'd left him five years earlier , he 'd been swinging wildly between feeling furious and hopeful , anxious and sad . It was almost a month ago now that Kelly 's brother had called to tell him that Kelly had died - and that she 'd confided something terrible to him just before dying . She 'd not only been carrying Cole 's child when she 'd left him , but she 'd abandoned the baby in the hospital 's nursery . Worst of all , Kelly 's brother had no idea what had happened to the boy , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushed his anger into a small , tight corner of himself . He had to stay focused . His first two disappointing dead ends in San Clemente and Laguna had taught him that showing up and laying the facts out on the table did n't work . Once the people discovered why Cole was there , they treated him with open suspicion and distrust . Now he knew to reveal as little as possible until he could determine the facts for himself . He reached for the newspaper and flipped to the classified page . Maybe he could get a job here , blend into the community for a week or two . Then when he met the people he was here to find , he would just seem like another newcomer to town rather than a man on a desperate mission . A sudden gust of wind whispered through the truck 's open windows , rustling the newspaper in Cole 's hands . He flattened the paper against the truck 's steering wheel to steady it , then ran a finger down the Help Wanted column . Halfway down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the truck 's ashtray and drew a circle around a large ad . And then Cole Travis smiled for the first time in weeks . Lauren Simpson took another sip of the killer coffee they served at Uncle Bill 's Caf and smiled across the silver-flecked Formica table at her son who was running on a zillion gigawatts of syrup-induced energy . " Read it again , Mommy . Read it again ! " Underneath the table , she stretched out her long legs and propped her feet up on the vibrant aqua Naugahyde bench across from her and let out a quiet sigh . At four years old , Jem 's capacity for repetition was truly infinite . " Pllleeaasssee ? " Jem Simpson 's powder-blue eyes danced with mischief as he shot her a " c'm on , Mom " grin . She had to admit she was a sucker for that look , one that was designed to melt a mother 's heart while getting her to agree to anything . She smiled as she picked up Valle Verde 's local newspaper and read the Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanted - A man who can do it all to remodel our home and barn . Must be a good carpenter , electrician and plumber . If interested , please apply in person at the Simpson 's on Agua Dulce Road . " Her son grinned up at her . " You think someone 'll come today ? " " Lord , I hope so . " She stuffed the newspaper back into her tote as she sent a quick prayer to the gods of home repair . More than anything in the world , they needed a really handy handyman to help restore their old house and get their big , beautiful barn ready for public use in just six weeks . But the ad had been running for a few days and so far , no nibbles . Lauren put aside her worries and smiled at her son . " If we do n't , pal , it 's just going to be you , me , a hammer and one of the biggest first-aid kits we can find . " She put money down on the table to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jem 's plate . " You did n't eat much . Why do n't you go ask Uncle Bill if he 'll box up some new pancakes for you ? " " Okay . " He slid his agile young body along the bench seat and picked up his plate . Lauren watched as he balanced it carefully on the way up to the counter , then saw Bill laugh at the mess Jem had made of the pancakes just like he had every Saturday morning since they 'd moved to this little town just two months ago .
