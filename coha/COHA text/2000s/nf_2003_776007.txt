Meeting // ( 1956 ) // Ted Hughes believed that destiny had singled him out to become the husband of Sylvia Plath . " The solar system married us , " he claimed , when he re-created their meeting in Birthday Letters , locating the astrological coordinates very precisely . The date was Saturday , February 25 , 1956 , under the sign of Pisces , in the zodiac ; the place was Cambridge University , from which Hughes had graduated a year and a half earlier . During the week he was living in a borrowed flat in London , working at a glamorous-sounding day job as a reader of fiction submissions at the film company J. Arthur Rank . But he continued to spend his weekends in Cambridge , hanging out with friends , mainly poets who were still enrolled at the university . They were ambitious , idealistic , apprentice artists , and that winter Hughes joined them in putting together a very small , very literary magazine , St. Botolph 's Review . One of the contributors , an American named Lucas Myers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Botolph 's Church , off campus . His residence inspired the cheeky title-these poets were ultra-anti-establishment . Friends began peddling copies of St. Botolph 's Review around the Cambridge colleges on publication day , spreading word that a launch party would be held at rooms in Falcon Yard that night . Sylvia Plath bought a copy from an American cousin of one of the poets , and he invited her to the launch . // Plath accepted immediately ; here was an opportunity she had been waiting for . She was studying literature at Cambridge on a two-year Fulbright Fellowship after graduating from Smith , a prestigious women 's college in New England . Her writing had won minor literary prizes in the United States and was beginning to appear in such American magazines as Harper 's , Mademoiselle , The Nation , and Atlantic Monthly . Arriving at Cambridge , she had quickly learned that the literary world was tightly networked in Britain ; even the limpest student publications were scouted for new talent by London publishers , who were often themselves Cambridge graduates . She immediately began submitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her poems had been printed in a little magazine called Chequer-and not only published but , to her amazement , scoffed at , in a fierce little low-budget paper called Broadsheet , which was produced every two weeks on a mimeograph machine by some of the St. Botolph poets . The men who reviewed Plath 's poems disliked on principle the formal verse at which she was very skillful , and on principle they derided what they disliked . " Quaint and eclectic artfulness , " the reviewer labeled Plath 's style , then added , " My better half tells me ' Fraud , fraud , ' but I will not say so ; who am I to know how beautiful she may be . " // The stapled pages of Broadsheet were read avidly by the local poets , and Plath was mortified at being so manhandled . This had been her first exposure to the blokishness of English literary culture . What bothered her most , though , was that little refrain " fraud , fraud . " Plath was aware of her shortcomings and did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rhetoric gave her an opening . Did he want to see whether she was beautiful ? She would introduce herself . She put on a pair of red party shoes and smoothed back her pageboy with a red hair band , then went to a bar with her date for the evening , where she fortified herself with several whiskeys . But before getting high she had fortified herself another way : she had memorized some of the poems in St. Botolph 's Review . // The party was well under way by the time Plath arrived in Falcon Yard and climbed in her red shoes up the stairs to the Women 's Union , where a jazzy combo hammered music into the babble of raised voices . Plath started working the room , getting noticed . She immediately sought out the reviewer who had called her a fraud ; he turned out to be a little chap , " frightfully pale and freckled , " quite unimposing in person , after all-Plath too judged poets by their looks . She cut in on men she wanted to dance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the long hall , she spotted a good-looking fellow , and learned his name : Ted Hughes , one of the two poets whose work she had memorized that afternoon . He caught her watching him and slouched across the room , staring into her eyes . She began yelling over the dance music , and he recognized that she was reciting lines from a poem he had written . He shouted back , " You like ? " He steered her into an adjoining room where they could talk , and refilled her glass with brandy , apologizing , lamely , for the bad notice in Broadsheet , though privately he shared the reviewer 's opinion . They sparred a bit , Plath nervy and exhilarated . He suddenly kissed her , hard , and she retaliated-she bit him on the cheek until blood ran . He snatched off her hair band and her silver earrings , and walked out . // Ted Hughes left the party with his current girlfriend . He did n't know , yet , that the solar system had married him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for the next several weeks , one of his cheeks would display a scar as did one of hers , a scar just under her right eye , about which he would learn much more during the ensuing months . // Hughes was n't looking for a wife that night . Quite the contrary-he was in a profound dither about where his life was heading . At the time of his graduation from Cambridge , Hughes had decided somewhat impulsively that he would apply for immigration to Australia , where his older brother , Gerald , had settled . The Australian government provided free passage to British men who agreed to work there ; Hughes envisioned taking up a life of shooting and fishing with Gerald , an avid sportsman . But Hughes deferred his application for the allotted period of two years-he was in no hurry . In March 1955-maybe between jobs-he suddenly wrote to Gerald that he was coming " without delay , " but again he delayed . By February 1956 , the deferral period was almost up , so Hughes reactivated the application , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nine more months in England . Nonetheless , he knew he could be assigned a ticket at any time , and the question came home to him , urgently : What was he actually going to do , in Australia , anyway ? Work as a teacher ? or a day laborer ? On the other hand , how much longer could he tolerate the hand-to-mouth existence he was leading in London and Cambridge ? Given these unmanning worries , Hughes may have been especially receptive to the kind of flattery Plath lavished on him at the launch party . She had plucked from St. Botolph 's Review a poem that glorifies male aggression . It opens with the line , " When two men meet for the first time , " and goes on to observe that ( male ) strangers sometimes attack each other on slight provocation , as animals do , because the animal is still alive in them : // their blood before // They are aware has bristled into their hackles // Plath had thrown herself at Hughes chanting the poem 's last words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first experience of Sylvia Plath was hearing her voice pronouncing his words as knowingly as if she had written them . She had not written them , but she knew where Hughes was coming from : in the poem 's DNA lay works of Sigmund Freud and D. H. Lawrence that were fundamental to a literary education in those days . Hughes had read Lawrence avidly in his teens , and Lawrence 's notorious celebration of " blood consciousness " appears undisguised in this poem that Plath picked out to memorize . Plath had read the same books , and had undergone a similar literary infatuation with Lawrence-she could n't miss the allusion . The first , telegraphic exchange that passed between Plath and Hughes that night was both a party game and a discovery scene in six syllables . " ' I did it , I. ' " " You like ? " When he kissed her , when she bit him , they were acting out a scene of primitive impulsiveness that would have been at home in one of Lawrence 's novels . // Ted Huge // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , but Sylvia Plath was looking for a husband , and Ted Hughes met her specifications exactly . " That big , dark , hunky boy , " she called him , in her journal the next day , " the only one huge enough for me . " He was a striking man , more than six feet tall , and he normally weighed around 195 pounds . In winter he liked to wear a heavy , brown leather army-issue topcoat that had survived the Great War , which gave his shoulders extra bulk and cloaked his shabby clothes in a bohemian glamour . // An extremely unkempt appearance was unusual at Cambridge in his day . Hughes was acutely aware of the class anxieties expressed in bizarre clothing at Cambridge : grammar school boys like himself attempting to counter the contempt of public school boys through displays of eccentricity . Hughes 's contemporary Karl Miller recalled that the most spectacular students " dressed in a weird exacerbation of Edwardian chic-pipe-stem tweed trousers , lapelled and brocaded waistcoats , wilting bow-ties , wafer-thin flat caps . " Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bought his corduroy cheap from a factory owned by one of the prosperous members of his mother 's family , up in West Yorkshire , and dyed it black himself . His classmate Glen Fallows thought he looked " as though he 'd just climbed out of a fishing smack after a stormy night . " A fellow poet , Philip Hobsbaum , was less charitable : " Ted was appalling . He had smelly old corduroys and big flakes of dandruff in his greasy hair . " // Hughes was actually quite self-conscious and shy in company , but he hid his unease behind mesmerizing talk . For sociability , he gravitated to the Cambridge pubs where students passed their time singing folk songs . Hughes had a big , distinctive voice , rich and sonorous , the mannerisms of his native Yorkshire detectable under the influence of his elite education . Many anecdotes about this voice appear in the memoirs of people who knew him when he was young . The American writer Ben Sonnenberg tells one of the best stories , about being invited to dinner with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American poet W.S. Merwin . " I felt like Hazlitt meeting Coleridge for the first time : bowled over by his warmth and energy , " Sonnenberg writes . While listening to Hughes , " I did indeed fall off my chair . When he helped me up from the floor , I wrote in my notebook , ' He did n't stop talking and I felt the vibration of his voice running down his arm . ' " The English writer Emma Tennant tells another good one , about finding Hughes sitting immobile in the middle of a lively London party in 1976 , broadcasting a rambling fairy tale to anybody who would listen ; she dragged him onto the dance floor , interrupting him long enough to initiate an affair with him . Over the years , a lot of women would want to interrupt Ted Hughes long enough to initiate an affair with him . According to some , Hughes was " the biggest seducer in Cambridge " - it was the chief topic of gossip about Hughes at the time Sylvia Plath met him , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who accompanied her to the party . // But even before she laid eyes on the man , Plath thought she had learned something essential about him by reading his work , and she was right . He had published only a few poems and essays , only in the smallest magazines , and usually under pseudonyms . But from the time he was sixteen , Hughes believed he was destined to become a poet on the grand scale . He wanted to be a poet like W. B. Yeats , whose work he studied passionately , beginning in grammar school and right through his years at Cambridge . After discovering D. H. Lawrence , Hughes wanted to be a poet like D. H. Lawrence too ; eventually he fulfilled both wishes in a highly original way . In 1956 he was still feeling his way toward his vocation-it was the sense of having a vocation that underlay his friendship with the somewhat fanatical undergraduates whose work appeared in St. Botolph 's Review . // One of these was the poet Daniel Weissbort , with whom Hughes later founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they met , Weissbort recalls of himself that he was awkwardly attempting to imitate Dylan Thomas . " I went up to Cambridge the year after Thomas died and I very much remember trying to write like him , " Weissbort said . " And of course the idea of the poet as a bohemian wild boy was very attractive , even though I did n't really know what it all meant . " For Hughes , the ideal artistic wild man was Beethoven-he often said that the most intellectually useful thing he did at Cambridge was listen to Beethoven . The poet Peter Redgrove recalled his first encounter , as an undergraduate , with Hughes 's Beethoven obsession . " A strange yowling was coming out of this doorway of a kind that I had never known before-I was not at that time musical . I knocked and entered . In the brightly lit room a hand-wound gramophone was playing a black disc-this was the yowling . My puzzlement was complete . Hughes 's own physical presence was also of a kind I had never encountered before . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of showing by their physique a kind of knowledge . " Hughes told Redgrove that they were hearing Beethoven 's last quartet . " ' It is as if the whole of the music is crushed into the first few bars , which are then unraveled , ' " Hughes explained . " ' Look ! This is the author ' - and he unhooked a frowning kindly plaster mask off the wall . ' This is how he walked ' - and he waddled this face towards me at chest-level . ' This was his height and how he walked . ' " Hughes introduced Sylvia Plath to Beethoven with the same thoroughness as soon as they began spending time together . // Yet on the whole , Cambridge University figures negatively in the myth of himself that Ted Hughes extracted from the facts of his life once he had become an established poet . Cambridge was " almost a deadly institution unless you 're aiming to be either a scholar or a gentleman , " he said . Hughes was not born a gentleman and did not wish to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge in the first place . He 'd had the good luck as a boy of eleven : after he failed the preliminary exam for admission to the excellent grammar school in Mexborough , the mining town where he grew up in South Yorkshire , his mother had persuaded the headmaster-a customer at the Hughes family tobacco shop-to permit her boy to sit for the actual exam , which he got through by writing an essay on his desire to be a gamekeeper . Eight years later , he performed badly on the exam for entrance at Pembroke College , but his grammar school teacher sent a sheaf of Hughes 's poems to the master of Pembroke , and the poems won Hughes admission as a " dark horse . " // Hughes had arrived at Pembroke in 1951 after serving his compulsory term of National Service , as a ground wireless mechanic for the RAF. //
