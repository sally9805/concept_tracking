They were having lunch at four in the morning , sitting in the unmarked , a black Dodge Fury double-parked on the south side of Forty-seventh Street just west of Tenth . Nash , in the driver 's seat , had a couple of chili dogs and a can of Pepsi . Next to him , Cooley was eating an Italian hero and drinking a large white coffee . It was early March and chilly , with a persistent rain , and they had left the engine running and turned on the wipers and the defroster . The car was warm , the windows were clear . Infrequently , for it was a Sunday night , a car came down the street , slowing to pass the unmarked , and when that happened , both men stopped eating . Nash checked the rearview , and Cooley craned his neck and looked behind him and followed the vehicle as it splashed past . They were looking for a particular car , a van actually , dark blue with white lettering . It belonged to a guy whom some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run in tonight from Virginia with a big load of pistols and automatic rifles to a place on Forty-seventh between Ninth and Tenth . Three other cars were stationed at various places around this part of Manhattan , so that if the guy slipped past the anticrime team that was setting up to make the grab , and ran , there would be cars in position to block the escape . Nash stole a glance at his partner , who had not said five words since coming back to the car from the all-night joint with their meal . Cooley 's brow was flexed , and his jaw was working rather more than crushing an Italian hero strictly required , indicating a certain tension . Cooley did not like being in a blocking car . No , Detective Cooley preferred to be the first one through the door , pistol out , yelling " Freeze , freeze ! " or some other hearty police exclamation . While Willie Nash considered himself as brave as it was necessary for an NYPD detective to be , and while no one had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceded that his partner was in a different class altogether in the guts department . Not exactly crazy , because Nash , who had a wife and three , would not have worked with a nut , but definitely on the unusual side . At thirty-two , Nash , though four years older than Cooley , operated as the junior partner , which he did not mind , really . It suited his flamboyant personality , and he liked the reflected glory and the lush collars you got when you hung around Cooley . Nash told himself that his part of the deal was watching Brendan 's back a full-time job in itself and keeping something of a lid on the younger man 's more outrageous impulses . He wondered now if Cooley was pissed at him for not doing something about the Firmo disaster , that failure being one reason why they were not on point tonight , but really , Nash thought , as he completed his first chili dog , what could he have done ? First of all , Cooley had been " Jesus ! That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nash looked to his right , startled . A late-model SUV was slipping by , red , an Explorer or a Jeep . " Who ? " " Lomax , who do you think ? Let 's go ! " " Cooley , we 're supposed to stay here until " " We 'll be right back . Come on ! Roll ! " Cooley tossed his coffee out the window and the remains of his sandwich down into the footwell . Nash put the car in gear and headed after the SUV , which he now saw was a Cherokee SE with New York plates . " Nice car , " he observed . " You sure it was Cisco ? " " I stared the fucker right in the face . Look at him ! He 's pretending nothing 's wrong , just driving along under the limit in a car that 's got to be fucking hot as hell . Give him the lights and siren . " Nash stuck the red flasher on the roof and goosed the siren , a quick moan . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on wet pavement . The Jeep took off , fishtailing down Forty-seventh Street . Without thinking , Nash tromped on the gas , and the Fury leaped forward , dumping his chili dog and soda all over the front seat . The light was red at Eleventh , but it was clear that the Jeep was going to run it , not a big surprise , and Nash did not brake either as they , too , shot through the intersection , drawing an outraged honk from a taxi . The Jeep made a big skidding right at Twelfth and headed uptown , Nash and the Fury on his tail , keeping a couple of lengths back , Nash now trying , through the pumping adrenaline , to take stock of the situation , gain some control . He should tell someone what they were doing . He should call for some backup . This was crazy . It was turning into a high-speed chase , on trail-slick roads ; someone was going to get hurt , and not after some armed-bank-robber , mass-murderer type , but an asshole car-thief snitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety miles an hour . At Fifty-third right by the little park , they passed two blue-and-whites parked nose-to-tail for a conversation , and seconds later both of those radio patrol cars joined the pursuit , the radio crackling with demands to know what was going on . Nash did not respond because he was driving too hard . Cooley did not either , although it was his job . The Jeep screamed up onto the Henry Hudson . It suddenly became damply cold in the Fury . Out of the corner of his eye , Nash saw that Cooley had rolled his window all the way down . " Closer ! " he yelled over the wind blast . Nash saw the needle pass a hundred miles an hour , the car shaking like a blender on the scabbed asphalt typical of the city 's arterials , bits of chili flying around , his hands locked tight on the shuddering wheel , and then he saw that Cooley had his gun out , and he wanted to yell out something to make Cooley stop , but he had all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated highway . He should have stopped , he should have taken control , but he did n't , and he could not really have told anyone why , except that every cop in the world would have understood why not . Nash brought the unmarked within five yards of the swerving Jeep , and Cooley began to shoot . Nash could hardly hear the flat crack of the shots , the wind filled the car so , and he lost count . He saw the rear window of the Jeep fly to pieces though , and the right rear tire come apart . The rear of the Jeep started to shimmy violently . Cooley was reloading . The Jeep drifted right , struck the guardrails , bounced back , went into a long sideways skid . Nash stepped on his brake and whipped the wheel over hard and felt , sickeningly , his rear tires break loose from the road and felt the tail of his vehicle proceed northward independently of the steering wheel . There was a grinding , metallic thump , a shudder , the scenery revolved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fury starred , buckled . Nash felt sharp things strike his face . " Brendan ! What the fuck ... ! " Boom . Cooley was firing through the windshield whenever the red shape of the Cherokee came into sight . Both vehicles were out of control , bouncing across the highway and past each other like dogfighters over blitz-time London . Then a louder crash and the red car disappeared no , there it was again for an instant another crash , and Nash saw a shower of sparks . After a time , Nash was able to bring the Dodge to a stop . " Let 's go ! " Cooley shouted , and leaped from the car . " Cooley ! Goddammit ! Will you wait ? " Cooley did not , but ran into the dark . Nash left the unmarked , too , and found his shaking knees could barely support his weight . Shots , a bunch of them . Now he saw the Cherokee resting sadly on its right wheel rims against the left-side median barrier , with its snout pointed downtown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a combat crouch , firing as he went . Nash pulled out his own pistol and took in the scene . He thought he had time for that because no one seemed to be firing back at him . The unmarked had come to a stop north of the wreck . To the south , one of the blue-and-whites had stopped in the center lane , illuminating the scene with its flashing bubble-gum lights . The other blue-and-white had parked across the center lane , blocking traffic a hundred yards to the south . Good , Nash thought , at least someone was using his brain . Then he heard the whick of a bullet flying by his head and the sound of a couple of shots not from Cooley 's gun . He crouched instinctively and fired twice into the Cherokee . He saw that Cooley was creeping around the rear of the wreck , toward the passenger side . More shots . This was the negative part of being Brendan Cooley 's partner . Bent almost double , with his pistol out in front of him , Nash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another shot cracked past , right in front of him , and the driver's-side rear window starred around a fat hole . Three more shots in rapid succession , and the windshield splintered . Oh , great ! He screamed at the two cops in the blue-and-white to stop firing , nor was he polite about it . An instant later he had his right shoulder pressed tight against the wet metal of the Cherokee 's flank . He worked the door latch and swung the driver 's door out , his pistol pointing . The upper torso of a man slumped down , its lower end held in the car by the seat belt . Nash stared at the face . It was , in fact , the well-known thief , fence , and general no-goodnik Cisco Lomax , Nash was relieved to observe , or rather the ex-well-known . The front of the man 's tan sweater was black with blood , and big wads of distressed tissue bulged from his face and neck . The back of the driver 's seat showed nearly a dozen little puffs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wound dressings ; the windshield was a spiderweb , sagging in its frame . Nash looked up and met the eyes of his partner through the passenger-side window . " How is he ? " asked Cooley . " He 's dead , Cooley . " " Are you sure ? " " He took one through the head and one through the neck . That usually does the job , plus about ten or so through the back of the seat . Hey , where are you ... ? " Cooley had dashed off , back to their Dodge . Nash saw that he had the radio mike in front of his face . Calling it in . Good . And here were the two cops from the first blue-and-white . " He 's dead , huh ? " said one of them . He was a slight , dark kid who looked about seventeen , hatless , his hair glued to his forehead by the rain . Franciosa was the name on his tag . " Yeah . Was that you doing the shooting ? " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good for you . " Nash crooked a finger at the kid 's partner , who seemed to be hanging back . The man came forward . He was a light-skinned black man a little older than Franciosa , inclined to be overweight , with a neat mustache . He stared at the hanging corpse . " Is he ... ? " " Dead , " said Nash , " Yeah , who are you ... Higgs ? Higgs , why were you shooting bullets at me ? " " I was n't shooting at you , Detective . " " You were , son . You might not have been aiming at me , but you were shooting at me . Did they train you on that weapon at the Academy ? " " Sure . But the way it was ... " " Well , when I was there , the instructor said , ' Always make sure of your target and what is behind it . ' I recall it because he said it about five hundred times . I guess they left that part out when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sullen now . " I 'm glad to hear it . That last shot of yours missed my head by about two feet . What were you firing at ? " " At the ... at the car , you know , I thought ... " " At the car ? You thought the vehicle was a danger to yourself or the public ? " " I mean the driver . Your partner was shooting like crazy , and I thought , you know ... " " That you would join in the fun . Well , you did put one through the passenger window , maybe killing the hostages back there ... " The cop gaped . " Oh , shit , I did n't now ... " " No , you did n't . " A long pause . " But in this case there were n't any , which is your dumb good luck . " Why do I bother ? Nash thought ; let their sergeant give them the nickel lesson . Cooley was approaching , his head down , the collar of his blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in ? " " Yeah . " Cooley looked at the corpse and shook his head . " The bastard tried to ram us . I had no choice . He spun the car around and headed right toward us . A big fucking car like that would 've gone through that Fury like a ball bat through a cream pie . Christ , the two of us would 've both been strained through the fucking radiator grille . Stolen car , too . We saw the little fuck-head in a stolen car , and we pursued . And he tried to kill us . " Nash saw the two uniforms exchange a glance . He could see that they knew who Cooley was and that a subtle transformation was going on in their minds , the little neural charges deposited by memory being overwritten by the story Cooley was spinning now . They were recalling how the fleeing vehicle had spun around and become a deadly missile heading toward the unmarked , until Cooley had shot the life out of its driver , and look , the SUV had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nash , too , was making the story happen in his mind , rather more self-consciously than were the two young cops , mainly because he had enough experience to understand how vulnerable the story was . But ... but just maybe it had happened that way . There had certainly been a lot of swerving around on the slick black road , and he had been totally consumed with keeping the Fury under control . He would go with it . The car had been stolen , the chase was legit . There was no point in dwelling on the fusillade Cooley had let off during the pursuit , or the shots fired after the car had stopped . Nash just prayed that some of the bullets had hit the son of a bitch from the front . Afterward , it was the usual mob scene . The ambulance arrived first , and then the crime-scene people crawling around , marking and retrieving shell casings and taking photographs . Five minutes later there arrived a couple of extremely unlucky homicide investigators from the Twentieth Precinct , within whose jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two of them , a thin , scholarly-looking fellow with horn-rims and a small Hispanic man built like a fire hydrant , examined what they were supposed to examine the corpse , the corpse 's vehicle , the surrounding highway , and the cops involved . The scholarly looking one grabbed a CSU photographer and directed her along the roadway , taking photographs of skid marks and guardrail scrapes , and of the bits of metal and glass lying on the road . He also pulled a big surveyor 's tape measure from the trunk of his car and took a remarkable number of measurements . Meanwhile , his partner was directing another CSU person with a camcorder and light . They were walking slowly up and down the highway . The camcorder light beam pointed downward , and both men were bent slightly , as if making a nature film about the lives of roadway insects . Soon after this investigation had begun , Cooley and Nash 's shift lieutenant , Robert Maguire , drove up and looked around , carefully avoiding any contact with the two homicide detectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then called the zone captain , James P. Robb , who was responsible for all detective work in a fat band across the West Side midsection of Manhattan . Robb had , of course , been in bed , and it had been a while since his last visit to a graveyard-shift crime scene , but he had driven in from the Rockland County suburb where he lived , arriving about half an hour later . Robb took a look around , too , and spoke with Maguire , and also did not talk to the two homicide investigators , although they knew he was there . Every cop on the scene knew that the bosses had arrived . They all exerted themselves at their tasks with exemplary zeal . Cooley repeated his story to Robb , using nearly the same words he had used with Maguire and the two homicide detectives . Nash and the patrolmen from the blue-and-white confirmed it in separate conversations with the two bosses . The bosses were not happy . It was late , it was raining , it was cold , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to converse and shining its light in everyone 's eyes . Several news vans had also appeared , held back by the roadblock , but obviously sniffing blood . Robb called his superior , the borough detective commander , Deputy Chief Inspector Charles T. Gavin , and gave him the short version of what had happened . Gavin did not come himself , but demanded that a full report of the event be ready on his desk first thing that morning and told Robb to make a statement perfectly void of information to the press , and to tell them that a press conference would take place at One Police Plaza that morning , too late to make the morning shows and early enough so that there was a good chance something more newsworthy and gory would transpire before the evening local news . Robb supposed that Gavin would soon be on the horn with the chief of detectives . Good . Everyone should be pulled from the cozy covers by this abortion . Robb returned his attention to it . It is a gigantic annoyance to the New York Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of duty . Cops say that the mass of paperwork generated by a police shooting weighs as much as the weapon that fired the shot . That annoyance becomes actual pain when the shot fired intersects any human flesh at all , except perhaps when the cop doing the shooting is obviously preventing a vicious , saliva-dripping felon from making off with a charming little girl , or similar . When the target dies , as here , and when the target is black and the shooter white , also as here , the pain reaches bone-cancer levels . When they had finished speaking with the principals involved , Captain Robb pulled Lieutenant Maguire into the backseat of his car and asked , " What do you think ? " Maguire said , " Cooley 's a good cop . Nash is very solid . " Robb sighed and said carefully , " I know that , Bob . I meant what about this piece of shit we got here , how are we going to play it ? " " Cooley said the perp charged him with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and Nash 's . " " That 's the story we 're going to go with ? " Maguire , like his immediate boss , was a comer in the department and understood the unspoken footnotes that hung from Robb 's question . It is difficult to make captain before age fifty , as Robb had , without being able to speak and understand a language that none but other initiates can comprehend . Maguire confidently expected to make captain , too , within the next couple of years , and he was similarly fluent . Wanting another moment to think about it , he deflected with , " Have you called his old man yet ? " " No , I wanted to check the situation out myself and get our ducks in a row . Who 's the stiff , by the way ? " Robb was not pressing the question , yet . " Lowlife . Not a citizen , " said Maguire . " Got a nice sheet for grand theft and receiving stolen . " " Violence ? " " No , sir , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah . That 's the bitch of it . But Nash is solid behind this ? " " Nash will hold up , " said Maguire . " Like I said . " A pause . " What I think , sir , is that we should let the system work here . We 'll do the normal administrative in the department , take their testimony , the four of them , which will all be consistent , like we just heard out there . Chase of a stolen vehicle , perpetrator 's attempt to ram pursuit vehicle , credible risk to officer 's life , not to mention potential for harm to innocent drivers , fucking guy roaring the wrong way down the road . Officer fired , killing perpetrator . A righteous shooting , end of story . No deep probing , no reason to believe there was anything funny . Cooley 's record is clean as a whistle . Never any paper on him , brutality or whatever . Racism ? Hell , his partner 's black . So we 're fine there . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , it 's a homicide , sir . I would expect the detectives involved to write it up to the best of their ability without fear or favor . " " Just like always . " " Just . And then it 's the DA 's ball . " " Right . Who caught the homicide , by the way ? " " Steve Amalfi and Oscar Rivera . " Robb consulted the card file in his head that held the names of the hundred-odd detectives who worked in his fief . Nothing popped up , which was good . Had either of the homicide cops been a discipline problem , or a whistle-blower , or under the personal protection of some significant PD rabbi , Robb would have known about it . So he would have a clean , competent report , written by men who could , if it came to that , be burned . Which report no one in the department would read in great detail . There was so much paper passing across the desks of the bosses . The main thing was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none of it could stick to him or his . He thought he was pretty safe . He could in reasonable conscience convey to Deputy Chief Inspector Gavin the results of his preliminary investigation : a clean shooting fleeing felon , credible threat not another case of a half a dozen heavily armed white morons blowing forty or so holes in a crippled Negro deacon or an old Hispanic lady or a mentally retarded , minority twelve-year-old . Let the system work ; good advice . The system would work and bring forth a result pleasing to the department and to the decent middle-class majority for whom it labored . That was mainly what the system was for , in Robb 's opinion . And he would call former chief inspector Ray Cooley and tell him that his younger son had killed a perp , but that the preliminary investigation was finding the shooting clean . And he would discreetly check on Amalfi and Rivera , too , to make absolutely sure they were solid , that they would also let the system work . The system now cranked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellevue , there to be probed by the medical examiner , whose duty it is to determine the manner and cause of death . The New York medical examiner is one of the best forensic medical shops in the nation , but even the best shops have difficulty attracting qualified personnel . Cutting up corpses is not what attracts most students to medicine , and most graduates of American med schools do not care to labor for civil service pay . The office was therefore populated largely by foreign born and trained , among whom , now wielding his knife through the chest of Cisco Lomax , was Osman Mochtar . Dr. Mochtar was from Afghanistan . He had escaped with his family during the Russian war and made his way to Libya , where he had obtained a scholarship to study at Garyounis University in Benghazi . He had been in the United States , in New York , for nearly five years . He thought cutting up corpses was a great job ; you did not have to speak English to them , nor did they ever lay upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one occasion when he had sought work with patients at a public hospital . He was not a diplomate of the American Board of Forensic Medicine . Dr. Mochtar extracted eight bullets from the body of Cisco Lomax and traced the course of two more . He determined that the cause of death was massive trauma to the brain from a bullet that had entered five centimeters posterior to the right zygomati arch , pierced the temporal bone , traversed an upward course , and exited through the anterior , left frontal bone . Even without this coup de grce , the subject , he concluded , was unlikely to have survived long . His seventh cervical vertebra had been shattered by a bullet that had torn through the spinal cord and exited from the right ventral surface of the neck , and there were two wounds in the left arm and six in the torso , the latter doing massive damage to the lungs and other internal organs . Dr. Mochtar dropped the last of these torso bullets into a kidney dish and handed it to the detective standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bags , signed his initials and badge number over the seals , and had Mochtar sign them , too . " So , tell me , Doc , " said Detective Rivera , " you traced the path of these bullets , right ? " " Oh , yes . These and two others that I have not got here . They exit to outside , you know ? " " Uh-huh . And they came from the front , the back , what ? " " Oh , definitely all from back , posterior as we say . And perhaps , you see , a little to the side in these cases . " The body was facedown . He indicated a wire sticking out of the skull wound , and another emerging from a black hole slightly to the left of the posterior midline of the neck . " The others are all directly from the rearward , except the shoulder wound , here at the left side . But this one to the skull is from the right , a fatal wound , do you see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Mochtar and a diener turned the body over , and Dr. Mochtar began to stitch up the corpse . The man had run from the police and had , most properly , been shot down . Dr. Mochtar did not think that a corpse shot in the back by police was worthy of much comment . Certainly he did not bring it to the attention of his superiors . Some short time after the completion of the homicide detectives ' report , at eight-forty the following morning , and its delivery up the chain of command , the police department notified the district attorney 's office that a police officer had killed someone . The part of the DA where the phone rings in such cases is called the special investigations bureau . It is located on the seventh floor of an ugly Depression-era building at 100 Centre Street . The criminal courts are here , and the DA 's office , and the Tombs , which is what New York calls its jail . Normal homicides go directly to the homicide bureau . On the sixth floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are the best in the business at bringing killers to justice . Whether or not they are , it is undeniable that they work daily with the police force , and of necessity form close relationships with homicide detectives , and so when a police officer is the killer , homicide does not get the case . Instead , it goes to the seventh floor , where the people in special investigations never work with the cops at all , if they can help it . If they ca n't , special investigations has its own little police force , made up largely of retired police . Its chief target is official corruption , but it is also called in when any arm's-length distance from the NYPD is required , as here . The person who took this particular call , just after ten , was the chief of the bureau , a man named Lou Catafalco . The bureau chief took the call himself because the caller was Chief Inspector Kevin X. Battle , from the police commissioner 's office , which was nearly as high as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a blue uniform . Battle had a reputation as the man they called in when things became messy . He had served three police commissioners and knew where all the bodies were buried . Catafalco was therefore alert for something interesting , and perhaps a little fetid . After the usual guy entre sports , their respective golf games Battle ushered in the main event . " Lou , why I called , we had a shooting last night , over on the Henry Hudson . Car chase , stolen vehicle , the actor attempted to ram the detective 's car and he was shot . He died at the scene . " " Uh-huh . Okay , where 's your guy ? I 'll send someone over right away . " " He 's waiting for you at the Two-oh ; but Lou ? This is a little bit of a special case here . " Here it is , thought Catafalco . " Oh ? Special in what way ? " " The officer involved is Brendan Cooley , " said Battle , and paused to let that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him . So what we have here is not the kind of officer and you know and I know that in thirty-nine thousand we 're going to get a few of those the kind that 's heavy with his hands , that drinks , that 's free with firearms . This is a splendid kid . He 's got the police Medal of Valor , as you know , and here in this incident he risked his life to take down a dangerous felon . " " The deceased was a felon ? " " Yeah , a thief , a pro , sheet on him a yard long . " " Minority . " " Yeah , as it happens , but there again , you got a kid who 's never had any trouble in that department . Now , Lou , I 'm just telling you this as background . Obviously , we 'll do our investigation , and you 'll do yours independently . What I 'm interested in here is doing the minimum damage to Detective Cooley 's career . We need to get past this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious question . " How 're they playing it ? " He meant the press . " Light . We had good control of the scene , the highway . Nothing in the News ; the Times had a two-incher on A20 . One mention on the metro part of the Today show . I do n't think there 's much to worry about on that end . Thug tries to kill cop , gets his , I think that 's the story . I figure it to die pretty quick . " " There 's the minority thing ... " " Yeah , that , " said Battle smoothly , " but I 'll tell you , Lou , the community will get cranky when it 's a bad thing . Hell , we get cranky when it 's a bad thing . The old lady , the kid with the water pistol shot in the back , the cop was drunk I 'm talking gross violations . This , on the other hand ... well , your guy will see Cooley and Nash , his partner , who by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom is also minority , as a matter of fact , and read the report , you 'll come to your own judgment . Steve Amalfi handled the case out of the Two-oh , he 'll confirm , of course . All I 'm saying 's we 'd like the system to work extra smooth on this one , grand jury in and out , so the kid can get back to his life . " Catafalco agreed that this would be a good thing for the kid . After some brief pleasantries , he hung up . He sat and thought for a while , lacing his fingers across his pear of a belly . Catafalco was a tall , heavy , untidy man in his late fifties , with a yellowish complexion and a slick of hair across his domed and freckled pate . He had been bureau chief here for over ten years , and while he had not rooted official corruption out of the isle of Manhattan , neither had he made any major political mistakes nor stepped on any important toes . He understood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bureau did not attract sterling talent . Special investigations ran no trials and so did not attract the bright , aggressive , and ambitious from among the new young lawyers who entered the DA each year . These went into the trial bureaus and , after a few years , if they were very good , into homicide . Catafalco was content with the less talented . He told himself that you did n't want flashy people , standouts , in special investigations , not for the slow , dull , but vital work of checking bank accounts and contracts and the mind-rotting task of , say , listening to all the telephone conversations of some suspiciously well-off elevator inspector . He himself was a methodical man , and he liked the slow , steady accumulation of evidentiary particles that , when pasted together , might sink a judge or a welfare clerk . Or a cop . He rose heavily and walked out of his office . Who to send ? He heard a door open and a young man appeared in the hallway , a chubby , shortish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief crooked a finger and said , " Flatow , come in here . I got something for you to do . " Back in his office , Catafalco settled into his big maroon leather chair . " You ever work a cop shooting before ? " " A cop got shot ? " " No , George , a cop shot someone . A cop gets shot , it goes to homicide . A cop shoots someone , kills him , like in this case , we handle it here . " Catafalco saw the worry bloom on the youth 's face and hastened to calm him . " It 's no big deal , this one . A car thief tried to ram a cop car and they took him out . Basically , what you need to do is go down to the Two-oh and interview some people , the cops involved , get their story . Also you 'll want to talk to the homicide investigators on the case . They 'll be there , too . It 's all set up a boilerplate operation . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catafalco paused . " You ever present to the grand jury before ? " " Yeah , a couple of times , before they transferred me out of the trial bureau . But I never did a homicide . " " It 's not a homicide , " said Catafalco quickly , and then , " I mean , technically it is , there 's a dead guy , but basically it 's a formality in this particular case . The shooting 's okay , no question of that . Our job is to process it through the system as clean as we can . In and out , ba-boom ! Prep your witnesses , parade them up to the g.j. , and get your no bill . You think you can handle that ? " " Sure , I guess . " Flatow took a piece of paper out of his pants pocket , smoothed it on his knee , reached for a writing implement , found he had none , began to search again through the same pockets . The bureau chief , sighing inwardly , handed him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stringent time frame . Four grand juries two in the morning and two in the afternoon run continuously in New York County . It would not be hard to slip into one next week and get the whole thing over with . Four hours later , when Flatow tapped on the door and stuck his head in , Catafalco was just getting ready to leave , for the special investigations bureau typically kept judge 's hours , and he had a number of errands to run , including , in just twenty-three minutes , an appointment for a massage . " You 're back already , " said the bureau chief . " How did it go ? " " No problems , " said Flatow . " The cops ' stories were all the same , so we wo n't have any conflict problems or like that . Cooley , the guy , the shooter , was pretty impressive . He 'll be a good witness . He 's some kind of hero , too , is what I understand . " " Yeah , he is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I got a copy . The guy , Amalfi , was n't that forthcoming . He said anything he had to say was in the report . " " You read it yet ? " " I have n't read it in detail , " said Flatow , who had , in fact , hardly looked at it before shoving it into his briefcase . The notion of reading the report before interviewing Amalfi and his partner , Oscar Rivera , had not occurred to him . " Basically , captain gave me a summary report that has all the major facts .
