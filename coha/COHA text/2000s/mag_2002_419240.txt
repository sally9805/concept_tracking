Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS <p> What 's next , and how well get there : A ROLLING STONE forum <p> ARE YOU READY FOR CHANGE ? CHEAP , abundant energy supplies have given rise to America 's plugged'in , superconducting $10.4 trillion economy , and it has enabled all the liberties and conveniences of our fast-tracked , Fed-Exed , 24/7 society . But the costs are escalating . Our oil dependency forces us to prop up unstable regimes and do business with governments whose values we condemn . Since the September nth attacks , most major newspapers have laid bare links between the Middle Eastern nations from whom we buy vast quantities of oil and the financing of terrorist groups . As we draw closer to war with Iraq , many now argue that the only way for the U.S. to have unbiased policy in the Middle East and elsewhere is to lessen our dependence on foreign oil . The environmental threats are also ominous and well documented : Burning fossil fuels is believed to be the primary cause of global warming , which will cause widespread drought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution from power generators accelerates lung and heart disease ; the mining of fossil fuels results in contaminated riverbeds and chopped-up mountains , not to mention leakage , spills and hazardous waste that require costly cleanups . <p> And then there is the threat of oil shortages . Some energy experts are sounding the alarm that based on current demand , the world 's known oil reserves will be depleted by midcentury . Other experts foresee the discovery of more reserves , but most agree that oil 's political and environmental costs will likely intensify in the coming decades , and that the future health of our nation will depend on tempering our oil addiction . <p> All this might be cause for despair - certainly the Bush administration 's blithe disregard of the true nature of the energy picture is disturbing . But below the radar of the federal government and the national media , an alternative-energy economy is rapidly taking shape . Great advances are being made in clean , fuel-efficient technologies such as car engines and turbines , in solar and wind technology , in creating energy from agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just across the technological horizon lies the holy grail of clean energy : the hydrogenpowered fuel cell , a system of power generation that emits no polluting byproducts - just fresh water . Major car and oil companies , such as BP and Shell , are investing heavily in this vision . Shell has drawn scenarios in which an accelerated shift to hydrogen and other alternatives will cause the global oil demand to decline after 2020 . <p> To discuss the opportunities , the perils and the challenges of the power shift , ROLLING STONE gathered together some of the leading experts of the energy industry . What emerged from our round table is that the need for change is inescapable . And now is the time to start getting ready . Before we begin talking about alternative energy , we need to talk about oil . <p> DANIEL YERGIN : A huge , complex energy system based primarily on fossil fuels underpins our $10.4 trillion economy , and oil accounts for forty percent of our total energy demand , more than any other source . Oil fuels our transportation sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oil and natural gas are the source of petrochemicals and are an essential component of agricultural fertilizers - meaning that petroleum even plays a part in growing our food . <p> ANTHONY PEREIRA : Over half of our oil supplies are imported - much of that from politically volatile nations including Iraq , Saudi Arabia , Venezuela and Nigeria . We are the addicts and they are the dealers . We have no choice but to play friendly with our suppliers-or , worse , resort to the method our government tends to favor : military intervention to keep them in order . <p> JOEL MAKOWER : You do n't have to look past the front-page headlines to see why our energy system urgently needs to change . Whether it 's the ice shelves splintering off Antarctica as a result of global warming or the specter of war in the Middle East , the biggest challenges of our time are ultimately related to drilling , digging , transporting and burning fossil fuels . How are our energy concerns playing out in the proposed war against Iraq ? <p> YERGIN : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply-the security and supply of oil are clearly part of the context for the current Iraq crisis . Iraq controls the second-largest proven oil reserves in the world , next to Saudi Arabia . <p> MICHAEL KLARE : Saddam Hussein has long had ambitions of gaining dominance over Persian Gulf oil supplies - he tried by invading Kuwait in 1990 . As he gains weapons of mass destruction , he poses an increasing threat to that region . Hussein has recently started signing contracts for access to his vast oil reserves with companies from France , China and Russia . If those contracts go ahead , the U.S. would be frozen out . The only way for the U.S. to prevent this from happening is to install a U.S. backed regime that could nullify those deals and reassign the contracts to American oil companies . The Arab-Israeli conflict also plays into oil politics . In the past , our Arab allies have withheld oil supplies to punish the U.S. for supporting Israel . If that conflict continues , are n't nations like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait likely to use this tactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East is spelled O-I-L . Plain and simple . We need to change our political system and the politics of oil so that we can turn our backs on some of those sources . We need an aggressive plan to develop alternative energy sources , promote efficient technologies and move toward greater conservation . But Washington does n't seem to be providing much leadership . Congress is in a stalemate over the energy bill , and even if one passes , it wont be anything like a Manhattan Project for alternative energy . Recent attempts to force Detroit to build more-fuel-efficient cars have failed . Why ? <p> AMORY B. LOVINS : It appears that these problems are almost impossible to solve politically . There are titanic lobbies fighting each other to a draw . <p> DAN REICHER : One side cries , " Increase domestic production ! Open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ! " The other side cries , " Improve automobile fuel efficiency ! " And then the system seizes up in gridlock . But in the midst of this federal-level vacuum , states are acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle standards . And Massachusetts , Illinois and New York are moving ahead with their own clean-energy initiatives . <p> LOVINS : The potential effect of fuel-economy standards is staggering . If the mileage of every car and light truck in the U.S. were improved by 2.7 mpg , that would save enough gasoline to eliminate the 2000 level of Persian Gulf imports . Fuel-economy efforts have proven very effective in the past . During 1979-85 , we improved average fuel economy by seven miles a gallon . During this period , oil use in the U.S. fell fifteen percent and Persian Gulf imports fell eighty-seven percent . And in that period , the U.S. economy grew sixteen percent . Then , in 1986 , President Reagan rolled back efficiency standards , promptly doubling Persian Gulf imports . Cheap oil is critical to economic growth . If we do n't have the domestic supplies to satisfy our needs , is energy independence a pipe dream ? <p> YERGIN : It 's hard to see energy independence . Our oil demands have been increasing - along with the percentage of our imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to stave off re-cession and stimulate growth , it 's not realistic that this will change anytime soon . <p> MAKOWER : The Bush administration has gone out of its way to kill environmentally responsible energy programs in the name of economic growth . But the symptoms of global warming are increasingly alarming and will eventually pose a severe threat to the economy . This threat could be avoided or offset by proactive policies that Bush could implement now . <p> KLARE : If reform is not voluntary , it 'll be some political or environmental crisis that forces us into action . <p> LOVINS : I 'd like to think that it would n't take a worse crisis than what we 're now facing to get Washington moving . It 's discouraging to see that insecurity , instability , price volatility and climate threats are not enough . Fortunately , private-sector investment decisions are proving more rational . I am very encouraged by how many energy companies now see their future in a very different direction than that of current national policy . You hear a lot of pie-in-the-sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been expensive and inefficient . Is it realistic to think we 'll be able to depend on anything but oil ? <p> DAVID CARMAN : Our entire economy rides on a huge , elaborate energy infrastructure that we 've been building up for nearly a century . We 're talking millions of miles of oil and gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines , tens of thousands of fossil-fuel-burning power plants . Enormous sums have been invested in the existing system . It 's not going to change overnight . But a lot of these power plants are nearing the end of their industrial life , so this is the right time to be asking questions about the future . <p> MAKOWER : The solar and wind industries have been growing at over thirty percent per year for the last four years straight . The clean-energy industry today is very much like the information-technology world of about ten years ago , with thousands of companies pouring billions of dollars into new technologies . But unlike the dot-com " revolution , " which involved untested entrepreneurs pushing dubious business models for unproven technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing life 's real needs : energy and transportation . <p> KAREN DE SEGUNDO : At Shell , we started our renewables division in 1997 . This was not for some eco-friendly reputation . The emphasis was and is on growing businesses . Our latest reports show that by the year 2050 , these technologies could generate one third of the world 's power supply . <p> LOVINS : The growth potential is colossal . Any country that is moving aggressively to develop those technologies now will have a big advantage in the world economy of the twenty-first century . Japan and Europe are leading the way - aggressively developing and subsidizing technologies that the U.S. originally developed but Congress and the White House stifled . Europe has just set a target to get twenty-two percent of its energy from renewables by 2010 . By contrast , when Vermont Sen. James Jeffords proposed a target of twenty percent by 2020 , it was laughed out of the Senate . <p> RICHARD TRULY : Our studies at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory show the entire U.S. electricity load could be generated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in the country-which is a quarter of the land occupied by roadways . As for wind , our studies show that six percent of the U.S. has Class-4 wind areas that , if harnessed , could produce one and a half times the nation 's electricity load . <p> LORD JOHN BROWNE : Renewable technologies show great promise - at BP Solar we are on track to triple our revenues to Si billion by 2007 - but we have to keep things in perspective . If you add up all the solar panels in the world today and run them at full capacity for a year , it would be enough to power Germany for two days . That 's not meant to damn it with faint praise . I believe that solar could become cost-competitive with traditional fuels within five years . But it may take time for politicians , architects , utilities and consumers to adopt these technologies into their policies , designs and daily lives . How expensive would a barrel of oil have to get before it posed a serious economic problem ? <p> YERGIN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil crisis is the equivalent of fifty-five dollars in today 's dollars , and a price like that would be a devastating wallop . Right now , oil is at twenty-eight dollars a barrel . If it went much over thirty dollars for a sustained period , that would be a big setback to the economy . We 've seen some of that kind of impact during the last few months . What about the people who say we 're going to run out of oil by midcentury ? <p> REICHER : " The Stone Age did not end for lack of stones , and the Fossil Fuel Age will not end for lack of fossil fuel , " an expert once said . The technology used to extract oil , coal and natural gas from formerly inaccessible parts of the earth is getting more sophisticated , which means the amount of resources we can extract cost-effectively is increasing . But the political tensions and environmental problems associated with fossil fuels are likely to become prohibitive long before these supplies are exhausted . <p> KLARE : I take a darker view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two percent a year-we will exhaust our known global oil reserves in less than fifty years . Those known reserves may expand , but the search is getting more desperate . The only unconquered frontiers are in Siberia and the Arctic , or in deep seabeds , tens of thousands of feet down . <p> YERGIN : I do n't see a physical shortage coming in the first part of this century . What drives change is price signals . The price of oil is driven up by scarcity , which could result either from a physical shortage or from conflict and interruptions of supply . Environmental regulations and taxes could also attach costs to traditional fuels that would drive consumers to alternatives . But the alternatives need to be cost-competitive . <p> BROWNE : There is no way to predict how long the supplies will last . The world was supposed to run out of oil in the year 2000 , according a report in 1972 by the Club of Rome . At BP we believe there will be plenty of oil for a long time . The question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether there will be demand . The White House is selling its energy policy as a forward-thinking set of programs that will wean us off foreign oil . Can we believe that ? <p> CARMAN : The president 's energy plan is doing everything necessary to move toward energy independence-to increase domestic production , expand renewable energy production , modernize infrastructure and build up a strategic petroleum reserve , so that if there 's an interruption of supply we have some recourse . <p> To say that we are an administration that solely favors drilling and digging is wrong . Of all the money spent by the Department of Energy on R &D; and deployment , more than half is spent in areas of energy efficiency and renewable energy . The budget for renewables and conservation is up over four percent from the days of the Clinton administration . Over half of the recommendations in the president 's energy plan have to do with renewables . President Bush has just renewed the tax credit for producers of wind turbines , to stimulate growth of that industry . We have also introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered by fuel cells . <p> MAKOWER : Numbers can be very deceiving . The Bush administration ca n't take responsibility for any increase in the Clinton administration 's renewables budget . Bush proposed cutting that budget in half when he first entered office , and Congress forced him to ramp it up to the current levels , which was humiliating . The renewables budget request for next year is two percent higher than this year's-that 's pretty anemic , considering that we may be fighting a $200 billion war in the Middle East . As for subsidies , it depends on how you count them . R &D; and deployment are just a small piece of what it costs to deploy fossil fuels . Think about the military spending that goes to defending our oil reserves , the costs associated with cleaning up environ-mental disasters related to pollution and mining fossil fuels , and the public-health costs of pollution from burning them . The New Tor ' Times reported that the Bush administration put a total of $6 billion in subsidies into conservation and fuel efficiency , compared to $25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a Diet Coke with a giant platter of chicken-fried steak . <p> PEREIRA : Should we add up all the members of the Bush administration who have ties to the oil , gas and coal industries , not to mention the automobile and steel industries ? Both the president and vice president are former oil executives . The White House chief of staff , Andrew Card , was president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association . Philip Cooney , the guy Bush appointed to the Council on Environmental Quality , was a lawyer for the American Petroleum Institute . The list goes on . So is the message that we ca n't wait around for the government to lead the way ? <p> REICHER ; It has to be a public-private collaboration . That means engaging regulatory processes to be more accepting of renewable energy and offering financial incentives to consumers and producers . <p> PEREIRA : Ultimately , how you spend your money is more influential than how you vote . If we demand clean technologies , producers will deliver - and the more we demand them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods anymore . Home Depot has expanded its distribution of solar panels from three to sixty-one stores ; Shea Homes , one of the nation 's largest home-construction companies , has a solar model that 's now on back order in California . But renewables are still too expensive , even for the most morally ambitious consumers . What could be done to help push these technologies into the mainstream ? <p> MAKOWER : The government can use its tremendous purchasing power to stimulate economies of scale . It can aggregate buyers federal , state and local agencies , developers and so on - and guarantee that they get a low price by negotiating bulk purchases over a sustained period . That would create a mass market for renewables faster than anything . This is not a job for the invisible hand-we need a plan of action from the top . <p> REICHER : The federal government is the largest consumer of energy in the country . It uses two percent of all U.S. energy . Simply investing in renewable energy and energy-efficiency measures for the 500,000 federal buildings would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal-level " renewable portfolio standard " that would set targets for renewable energy production would also be an important move . <p> BROWNE : As with any new technology , the role of the government is to incentivize both consumers and producers . Japan , for instance , has the biggest solar market in the world because the government provides subsidies that make it almost irresistible for builders to incorporate solar roofs into their designs . The second-biggest market is in Germany , because any homeowner or business that generates solar electricity can sell it to the government at a premium . How else could the government expand the role of alternative energy ? <p> STEMPEL : There are technical subtleties that are essential to getting these new technologies to take hold . A solar-powered building can function like a small power plant by pumping any surplus power it generates back into the power grid and selling it to a local utility . But a technical , regulatory and legal framework must be put in place for this to work . So far , thirty-three states have these " net-metering laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the federal level . <p> MAKOWER : These technical details play a big role in marketplace acceptance , but neither initiative is addressed in the Bush energy plan . And while Congress remains in gridlock , there 's no hope for any action on a federal level . <p> CARMAN : The Bush administration prefers that states stay in the driver 's seat on decisions related to net metering and renewable portfolio standards . We do n't feel that solar is a mature enough technology for substantial tax credits and/or bulk purchases on a federal level . We feel our dollar is better spent on R &D; to create cheaper solar products that can move beyond niche applications to the mainstream . If solar is n't ready yet , then what is ? <p> GARMAN : Ten years ago , wind energy cost eighty cents per kilowatt-hour . Now it 's down to six cents - on par with the cost of traditional electricity - which is why the president has agreed to renew tax credits for wind producers . There are massive wind projects going up now throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from putting wind turbines on their land than from growing crops . <p> REICHER : Biomass is already used to power three percent of the U.S. energy supply . It 's one of the few renewable substances that can actually replace oil . It 's all the organic waste materials that come from farms , forests , solid-waste dumps , scrap wood left over from logging , corn husks , whatever . You can burn it or refine it into almost any product that can be made out of oil-not just electricity but high-value petrochemicals , too . <p> STEMPEL : Do n't underestimate the increasing affordability of solar . Unisolar has developed peel-and-stick solar panels that come rolled up like carpet and can be cut and pasted onto roofs and walls by homeowners themselves . Vice President Dick Cheney famously pooh-poohed conservation . But is n't figuring out new ways to save energy the most efficient way to reduce burning fossil fuels ? <p> REICHER : In the last twenty years , the second-biggest and cheapest source of energy has been energy efficiency-second only to oil . Without this energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy costs would be a couple of hundred billion dollars a year more . <p> PEREIRA : Major home appliances like refrigerators , washer-dryers , TVs and air conditioners have become roughly forty percent more efficient than they were twenty years ago . We can continue to make radical improvements in the energy efficiency of nearly everything we plug into the wall or fuel with gas without diminishing their performance or changing our lifestyles . <p> LOVINS : In terms of efficiency , the single most important products available today are hybrid-engine cars . I drive a Honda Insight that gets sixty-four miles per gallon . Hybrid pickups and SUVs are also on the way , and not a moment too soon . The EPA announced last week that the average fuel economy of the 2003 cars is 20.8 mpg - six percent lower than it was fifteen years ago , before the SUV craze . But hybrid cars are a bridge technology . The future of the auto industry is in hydrogen-powered fuel cells , which require no gasoline whatsoever . Is the consensus that the post-oil economy will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we already are in a hydrogen economy . In the past , all our energy sources have been based on hydrocarbons . Hydrogen is the energy component of a hydrocarbon - the carbon burns off and becomes soot that pollutes the skies . First it was wood , later it was coal , then it was oil and natural gas . All these fuels are composed of hydrocarbons , but at each step we 've been lowering the ratio of carbon to hydrogen . The logical conclusion is that we will optimize methods for burning pure hydrogen and eliminate the polluting component . <p> DE SEGUNDO : But we still have to create hydrogen , which takes energy . You might burn fossil fuels to split your hydrogen molecules , but that would miss the point : If you can make hydrogen using renewable energy , then , of course , you are onto something resembling the holy grail . The Shell hydrogen division is currently involved in an effort to make Iceland the first entirely hydrogen-based economy by 2030 , using its geothermal and solar resources to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envisions , oil use begins to decline around 2020 as the demand for hydrogen and other alternatives expands rapidly . Are people ready for the upheaval ? <p> BROWNE : At BP , we are proving wrong the myth that there has to be a harsh trade-off between economic growth and the protection of the environment . In 1990 , we established a target of reducing the greenhouse-gas emissions from our own operations and activities by ten percent by 2010 . This year we met this goal - eight years early . And with all these changes , our profits have increased . <p> KLARE : Our economy ca n't make a smooth change without long-term planning at the highest levels . The technology is there , but it needs a push . And that has to come from Washington . <p> World population will swell to 9 billion people by 2050 , up from 6 billion today . This alone will intensify the current stress on our resources . But then we have to add to that increased pollution levels and the effects of global warming . The nightmare scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fighting for enough water , food , fuel and shelter to survive . <p> LOVINS : If we do n't leapfrog industries like automaking and aviation , we 'll be locked in cutthroat commodity competition in saturated markets , rather than carving out new markets of next-generation technology that can give our industries a commanding lead . If Washington does not encourage up-heaval , what will be lost is opportunity . <p> MAKOWER : We have two extreme scenarios . One is apocalyptic ; the other envisions a world of clean , unlimited energy supplies . We do n't know what is going to happen , but we do know that one way or another it means rebuilding our energy economy from the inside out , and that will require a lot of ambitious thinking and initiative . There is always something painful about change , especially on an epic scale such as this , but if people are smart , they will realize that what we have here is a historic opportunity . <p> AMANDA GRISCOM is a writer and energy consultant in New York .
