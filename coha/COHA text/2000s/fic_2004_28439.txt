Chapter One " ARE you having a heart attack or just resting ? " May had heard the approach of the car into the farmyard , had even managed to slightly raise one eyelid in order to register the fact that it was n't a vehicle she recognised . Which meant her visitor was either lost , or a seed or fertilizer salesman , neither of which raised enough enthusiasm to rouse her from her sitting position on the convenient bale of hay outside the milking shed . She managed a grunt of acknowledgement . " Which do you think ? " " In all honesty - I 'm not sure ! " The man sounded slightly surprised by his own uncertainty , as if it were n't an emotion that came naturally to him . May managed to pry that single eyelid slightly open a second time , just enough to be able to have a look at her unexpected visitor . Probably aged in his mid to late thirties , the man was tall , very much so , with thick dark hair that looked inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an arrogant slash of a nose , his mouth grimly set over a squarely determined chin . Uncertainty about anything certainly would n't sit easily on those broad shoulders , either ! " Well , let me know when you 've made up your mind . " May sighed wearily , closing her eyelid again . " Hmm , " he murmured thoughtfully . " I 've never actually seen anyone have a heart attack , but I 'm sure they should be in more pain than you appear to be in . On the other hand , falling asleep sitting outside on a bale of hay , in a temperature that ca n't be much above freezing , does n't seem too comfortable , either ! " he concluded dryly . May gave a dismissive movement of her shoulders . " Anywhere is comfortable to fall asleep when you 've been up all night . " " Ah , " the man murmured knowingly . She opened her eyes just wide enough to glare at him . " With the vet , " she defended impatiently before closing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawled wryly . May gave a groan as she roused herself to sit up on the bale of hay , every muscle in her body seeming to ache as she rubbed sleep-drowsed eyes before frowning up at her visitor . When she viewed him more closely , it was possible to see the arrogant lift of his square-cut chin , the complete self-confidence in the way that he stood and the hardness of his handsome features . Just the type of man she felt like dealing with after a sleepless night ! " Can I help you ? " she prompted irritably . " That depends , " the man murmured ruefully . " On what ? " She sighed at this procrastination , really in no mood to deal with a lost out-of-season tourist or indeed a pushy salesman . He shrugged those broad shoulders . " On whether or not your name happens to be Calendar . " Not a lost out-of-season tourist . A seed or fertilizer salesman , then . " It could be . " She pushed herself up onto her feet with effort , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches taller than her own five feet eight in height . The man gave her a considering look , laughter glinting in those piercing grey eyes now . Which was n't so surprising , May acknowledged , easily able to visualise the scarecrow figure she must represent . Her wellington boots were muddy , her jeans likewise ; worse , she was still wearing the same clothes she had put on yesterday morning , not having been to bed yet or indeed managed to get inside for a refreshing shower . Her face was probably smeared with dirt from lying on the barn floor most of the night , a woollen hat pulled down low over her ears , mainly to keep out the bitingly cold wind but also to keep her long dark hair from the same muddy fate as the rest of her . Yes , she had no doubts she did look rather funny . But at the moment , exhausted as she was , she was n't in the mood to laugh , at herself or anyone else . " You do n't sound too sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She shrugged , sighing heavily . " Look , I have no idea what you 're selling , and I probably do n't want any anyway , but if you could come back tomorrow I might at least be willing to talk about it - " " Selling ? " he repeated frowningly . " But I 'm not the one - I have a better idea , " he stated briskly as May gave a weary yawn , at the same time swaying slightly on her feet . " Let 's go into the farmhouse . " He took a firm hold of her arm . " I 'll make you some coffee . Strong and black , " he decided after another glance at her face , her eyes appearing a deeper green against her paleness . " And maybe then we can introduce ourselves properly . " May was n't sure she wanted to be introduced to this man , properly or otherwise , but the promise of making her coffee was certainly a strong inducement to at least letting him in as far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of man who excelled at most things he did ! And he did n't exactly look the type of man who felt the need to pounce on some unsuspecting female - in fact , with those looks , she suspected it was probably usually the other way round ! " Done ! " she accepted huskily , allowing herself to be guided across the yard and into the kitchen , sitting down on one of the kitchen chairs as the man moved dexterously about the kitchen preparing a pot of strong coffee . Lord , that smelt good , she acknowledged a few minutes later as the strong aroma of brewing coffee filled the warmth of the room . A cup or two might even help her to stay awake long enough to complete her chores for the morning . It had been a long night , if ultimately a successful one , and the thought of all the jobs she still had to do had been the reason she 'd sat down wearily on the bale of hay earlier . Only to fall asleep . Which , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most comfortable thing in the world to have done in late January . " Here you are . " He placed a mug of strong black coffee in front of her before sitting down opposite her with another mug of his own , looking perfectly at ease in the confines of her untidy kitchen . " I 've added two sugars , " he told her frowningly . " You look as if you need the energy . " May did n't normally take sugar in her coffee , but she accepted that her visitor was right as she sipped the strong , sweet brew , instantly feeling the surge as the caffeine and sugar hit her bloodstream . " I 've made up my mind , " he murmured softly . " Sorry ? " May glanced across at him , frowning slightly . Obviously the caffeine and sugar had n't done quite such a good job as she had thought - because she had no idea what he was talking about . " You were sleeping earlier , " he stated firmly . She grimaced . " I already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because you and the vet were up all night . " When he put it like that ... ! " With a ewe that was having a difficult time lambing , " she explained dryly . Not that it was any of this man 's business , but still ... Their vet , John Potter , was a man of fifty or so , had been married for twenty years , and had three teenage children ; it would n't do to have that sort of speculations spread around the neighbourhood . It would n't do her own reputation too much good , either ! ( Continues ... )
