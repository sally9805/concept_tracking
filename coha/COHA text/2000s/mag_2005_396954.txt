Wendell Willkie and our better angels <p> In the course of writing a book about Wendell Willkie 's amazing come-from-nowhere victory at the 1940 Republican convention and what it meant for the world , I gradually realized that I was describing a time when the American people  --  or at least a majority of them  --  managed in many ways to rise a bit above the usual limits of human nature . Christianity was kinder . Generosity , idealism , and good citizenship came in larger helpings . What made people seem better back then ? What was different about this time , as the Great Depression was ending and World War II had begun ? Can we learn anything from it that might help us today ? Old demons <p> Notice I said , " in many ways " Not everyone was better in every way . Lynchings still happened . The St. Louis , loaded with Jewish refugees , had been turned away from our shores in 1939 . Jobs and educational opportunities were harder to find , not just for blacks and Jews , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smith <p> Idealism  --  the conviction that Mr. Smith really could go to Washington  --  motivated the outpouring of volunteers who tallied to Willkie 's cause in 1940 . Willkie , a charismatic businessman , had only recently become a Republican . But unlike the other Republican candidates , he was firmly committed to stopping Hitler . His volunteers packed the gallery at the Republican National Convention , chanting , " We want Willkie ! " After five exciting ballots , during which Willkie rose from 105 to 429 of the 501 votes needed to nominate , they finally overwhelmed the conservative isolationists who had dominated the party and propelled Willkie to victory on the sixth ballot . This victory was not inconsequential . Had Willkie not won , Hider might have . Good thing Grover Norquist was n't around <p> Both Franklin Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie supported a military draft , which passed Congress less than two months before the 1940 election . Politicians are ordinarily risk-averse at such a time . But Roosevelt and Willkie had the courage to advocate a draft , even though it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not at war . Even their great leadership would not have been effective , however , if the American people had not had enough of the right stuff to respond . Polls show that more than 60 percent favored the draft . If we had to go to war , they were willing to share the burden . They displayed the same spirit in paying higher and higher taxes as war threatened and then arrived . In 1943 , Willkie criticized Roosevelt for not raising taxes more . Can you imagine a Republican doing such a thing today ? Country boys <p> To a remarkable degree , we saw ourselves as the same back then . Most Americans born before 1920 came from rural backgrounds . They had no difficulty identifying with the down and out , because they or their friends and family had been there  --  many quite recently , like the six relatives who slept one after another on our living room couch in the 1930s as they looked for jobs . Their self-image came straight from Norman Rockwell . My father described himself as " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had died in 1935 , but who remained the leading male role model of the era . Where did the lobbyists sit ? <p> People did n't try to show how different they were . Few knew  --  or cared to know  --  about the right wines . Adolescents and their parents did not agonize over the SATs because there were no SATs . Private schools existed , but it seemed like almost everyone went to public schools or parochial schools that were similarly egalitarian . Our favorite sports were professional baseball and high school and college football and basketball , all played in arenas devoid of the luxury sky boxes that separate the people from the privileged today . Tutored tots <p> Back in 1940 , people did n't worry about getting their kids into the right kindergarten . Today , there is a whole industry devoted to preparing children for kindergarten . An example of what they do comes from The Wall Street Journal 's June Kronholz : <p> " On a bright summer day , Hank Barnes settles in the chair across from his tutor , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . <p> " Hank is four years old , and among the worries that prompted his mother to enroll him at the Sylvan Center here is this : Hank was behind on his scissor skills . " <p> Incidentally , Sylvans main competition is Kaplan , which is part of The Washington Post corporate empire . Indeed , Kaplan is the company 's biggest profit-maker . Since its success depends on exacerbating the anxieties of the meritocracy , the Post , however distinguished its reporting may be , is in the dubious moral position of encouraging social tendencies that are less than desirable , the most conspicuous of which is an obsession with getting the highest test score and obtaining admission to the most prestigious school  --  as distinguished from emphasizing wisdom , character , humor , and the actual ability to do a job . It reminds me of The New Yorker and its advertising . No matter how great the editorial content produced by its writers , the fact remains that the magazine 's advertising encourages a kind of consumer snobbery heavily related to the prices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Topeka <p> Since middle-class people like my mother and father tended to identify with that the folks back on the farm , that meant they did n't identify with and try to emulate the rich nearly as much as today 's middle class does . Social snobbery existed , but it was widely ridiculed . Think of the Marx Brothers and their favorite foil , the sanctimonious society lady played by Margaret Dumont . Blessed are the merciful <p> Christianity was even more dominant as the national religion than it is today , But it was mostly a different kind of Christianity . Although there were extremists like Father Charles Coughlin , who called Roosevelt 's program the " Jew Deal , " the great majority of American Christians resisted efforts to fan their mild anti-Semitism into the kind of hatred Hitler ignited in German Christians . This was due , I think , primarily to two factors . One was the recent experience with Prohibition . If you remembered , as my father did , spending every other Sunday morning not attending religious services but driving up country roads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your religion , and easy to feel merciful to other sinners . When Mother would start to get indignant about some local girl who had strayed , my father would say , " Be human . " Our preacher-in-chief <p> The other major influence on Christianity at that time was Franklin Roosevelt . In a role largely unacknowledged by historians , he served as spiritual leader of his country , or at least as the most notable exponent of its dominant religious beliefs . And he saw the New Deal as applied Christianity . On New Year 's Eve , 1939 , Roosevelt , before reading A Christmas Carol to his family gathered around the White House fireside , spoke to the nation by radio . He quoted the Sermon on the Mount and asked that we " pray that we be given the strength to live for others . " Can you imagine such a prayer being uttered by today 's evangelicals ? Their focus is on what God can do for them , from saving their souls , to rescuing them from alcoholism , to making them successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not saints , however . They did n't want to be Scrooge , but they did n't want to be suckers either . They saw themselves as shrewd businessmen , not easily gulled . So , when Roosevelt sought support for his trade of 50 destroyers to the British in exchange for bases in the Western hemisphere , he portrayed it as a bargain comparable to the Louisiana Purchase . The King and the Duke <p> This distinction between not wanting to be a sucker and not wanting to make a sucker out of others helped explain the two sides of the American character . One is the greedy , lying , cheating snake oil salesmen represented by Mark Twain 's " The King and the Duke " The other is represented by the down-to-earth common-sensical Huck and Jim , and the decent entrepreneurial Tom . It is one of the blessings of history that when Hitler threatened the world , our good side was ascendant . What 's the matter with kids today ? <p> Today , the snake-oil salesmen seem to be on top . Many young people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have always been . I hope some of them now know better . Convention wisdom <p> Wendell Willkie 's come-from-behind victory in 1940 would not be possible today . Primaries determine the nominee , often before April 1 . On the first of April , 1940 , Willkie was 0 percent in the polls . But events that happened after that date  --  the Nazi invasions of Denmark , Norway , Holland , Belgium , and France  --  made clear that his firm stand against Hitler was right , and that he would be the best man for the Republicans to nominate . <p> Would n't it be better if today 's conventions had the same freedom to choose the best candidate ? The purpose of the primaries was to make the process more democratic . That end can be attained by having most of the delegates elected , leaving them free to use their best judgment at the convention . Whose bed am I in ? <p> Both Wendell Willkie and Franklin Roosevelt had sex lives that would not have escaped the attention of today 's media . Willkie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern writer Josephine Pinckney , the most notable and long-lasting of which was with Irita Van Doren , the book editor of the New York Herald Tribune . Franklin Roosevelt had affairs with Lucy Mercer Rutherford and his secretary , Missy Lehand , and probably with Margaret Suckley , Dorothy Schiff , and Princess Martha of Norway . Lehand lived on the third floor of the White House , and Princess Martha on the second , where Eleanor Roosevelt 's dear friend Lorena Hickok also resided . These were the ingredients of a French sex farce , not to mention headlines in the National Enquirer . Public scrutiny of their romantic adventures would almost certainly have destroyed both Roosevelt and Willkie . They would not have been able to lead the country at a crucial time in its history . Does anyone think that would have been a good thing ? Easy street <p> Today , practically everyone in the middle class is building a McMansion , or at least wants to . For a feeling of what the average man wanted in 1940-41 , consider an ad from Union Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous income . <p> The ad was a great success because that sum struck most of us as not only more than adequate , but also as all we could reasonably desire . Of course , back then bread was 10 cents a loaf , a new car could be bought for $650 , and what is called a starter house today went for $5,000 or so . Still , it is true that not nearly as many people wanted to be rich or wanted to be rich enough to make it their main ambition , as it seems to be for far too many of today 's middle class . Charging into battle <p> One great difference between now and 1940-41 is that then we were preparing to resist aggressors , having been alarmed by Mussolini 's invasion of Ethiopia ; Japan 's of China ; and Hitler 's of Poland , Norway , Denmark , Holland , Belgium , and France . Today , we are the aggressor . We invaded Iraq . <p> If there really had been an imminent WMD danger , the invasion might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laudable goal , justify killing thousands of Iraqis and getting a lot of our soldiers killed and wounded ? It seems to me that we 've become entirely too casual about shooting first . Remember , we did n't declare war against Japan until it had attacked Pearl Harbor or against Germany until Hitler had declared War against us . Two daughters , three sons <p> Would we have been willing to invade Iraq if we had an army composed of draftees , among whom , say , were the daughters of George W. Bush ? The measure of a whole different attitude is that three of Roosevelt 's sons were already in the military by the time of Pearl Harbor . Changing the subject <p> I 'm sure that by now you 've had enough , probably more than enough , of my reflections on 1940-41 . It 's time to move on to more current Tilting fare . Hint : Do away with the nametags <p> While I must confess that I am delighted to see the White House 's obvious nervousness about what might develop in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a word of caution for my fellow liberals . The CIA 's various covers for its agents have been notoriously transparent . We ran an article 30 years ago explaining how easy it was to identify them . The situation has improved little since then . So , I urge liberals to be sure they devote at least as much energy to getting the CIA to do a better job of concealing its agents ' identities as they have been giving to berating the White House for its part in the Plame case . " Negro removal " <p> This magazine has always believed the liberals should not hesitate to join conservatives when the conservatives are fight . It strikes me that the conservative objection to the use of eminent domain to seize private property for the benefit of private developers is just such a case . Charlotte Allen , an excellent conservative writer whose work has appeared in these pages , recently reminded readers of The Washington Post of the destruction of working class homes and business that was wrought by urban renewal in the 1950s . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal " by their critics , involved just the same kind of taking of private property for exploitation by developers . May we suggest a simple brochure ? <p> Washington mayor Tony Williams took 33 trips last year with a total time absent from his office amounting to at least 83 days . The Washington Post reported that other big city mayors " are rarely away from their cities more than 10 days a year . " Why does Mayor Williams travel so much ? Because , he says , it helps boost the city 's image . Last year , Williams found that his city 's image required visits to Barcelona , Beijing , Bangkok , Rome , and Paris , among other destinations . Indeed , the image situation was so dire in Paris that it required two trips . <p> Worried that the mayor might be neglecting district government business while he 's away ? Do n't give it another thought . " It does n't matter , " one aide assured the Post , " if he 's in China or upstairs . " Come to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . The big problem still exists <p> The accounting reforms , however laudable , that have been brought about by Sarbanes-Oxley , do not resolve the basic problem of the industry , points out my friend and former colleague , Joseph Nocera , in his column in The New York Times . That problem is the fact that the accountant is paid by the company being audited . As long as this is so , the accountant is going to be tempted to please the fellows who hired him . <p> A few years back , this column proposed a solution to the problem : have the auditor chosen , not by the company , but by an independent board . The fee could still be paid by the company or , if you want an absolute firewall between them , from a fund contributed to by companies as a percentage of their annual income . Bright ignoramuses <p> One reason I feel compelled to give history lessons in this month 's column is that too many Americans , even very bright ones , are ignoramuses when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are not being taught it , " Sen. Lamar Alexander recently told a congressional hearing . And David Broder reports that the Florida legislature has enacted a law that allows students to graduate from high school without having been exposed to even one American history course . Bush league <p> Speaking of Florida , does having a governor named Bush mean that the state can get away with leaving some children behind ? Last year , according to George W. Archibald of The Washington Times , " 77 percent of Florida schools failed to make adequate yearly progress under No Child Left Behind . " Not to worry . The George W. Bush administration has moved the goalposts for the president 's brother . Instead of having to show 48 percent of students are proficient in reading , which hardly sounds too exacting , the goal is now only 37 percent . A similar adjustment was made in math . It 's either that or a massive Depends subsidy <p> Buried in the back pages of a recent issue of The Wall Street Journal was a story of immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A growing number of states , " including New Jersey , California , Virginia , Florida , and New Hampshire , now require businesses to make toilet facilities available to customers and visitors . The Journal story dealt with the significance of this requirement for small businesses , which convinced me that both the story 's author , Gwendolyn Bounds , and her editors had to be under 65 . <p> Those of us who have passed that milestone would have put this story on the front page , the news ranking in importance with a major medical breakthrough . The reason is that for many of us , almost every day presents a problem of access to toilet facilities because the older you are , the more urgent the urge to go becomes . I carry in my mind a map of the few facilities available as I walk from my office to my car or to a nearby restaurant . Alas , there are some places that turn you away , although the desperate look on my face sometimes softens their stand . Now , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my side .
