My Grandfather // From March 1940 to June 1941 // For those of us not sent to Siberia , the Russians had brought Siberia to us . Every bit of fuel , everything that could burn , even tiny birds ' nests , was sent to the front . I practically lived in my heavy grey Afghan coat lined with rabbit fur . That coat was my saviour . Thank heavens Aunt Uchka had married a furrier . Hersch Leib had had coats made for everyone in the family . We could have chosen anything , even a famous Zolkiew fur , so popular in Paris . But with the icy winds blowing off the steppes , nothing was warmer than Afghan lamb . So that is what my family wore . // Six months after the Soviets occupied Zolkiew we were still in the icy grip of our first occupied winter . The news on my grandparents ' radio was just as chilling . We despaired when the United States announced its neutrality . And even though England and France had declared war on Germany , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France did was invade a lightly defended area of Germany . They made it all of 12 kilometres before turning back . We had been abandoned . // On most days after school , I would stop off at Uchka 's on the way home . I looked forward to sugar cookies , tea , and playing with Zygush and Zosia  --  especially Zosia . I had given up dolls for books when I was six , but I could n't get enough of her . Zosia liked to put her cheek next to yours and clutch your face when she was carried . I did n't want to be any other place on earth when she did this . According to Uchka , I was Zosia 's little mother , her mammeleh . // One day , when I went to Aunt Uchka 's , her house was empty . Before , I would have thought nothing of their absence , but now I immediately assumed the worst . I ran through the lanes in Uchka 's neighbourhood back to my house , praying to find them there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory . I cut through the alley behind the pink walls of the convent to my street . I rushed up the steps into the foyer that separated our flat from that of my grandparents ' , stamping off as much snow as I could . Even with my fur hat still over my ears , my coat collar up and my scarf wrapped tightly round it , I could already hear the noise coming from the next room . Something had happened . Everybody was speaking all at once . No one noticed I had walked in the room . I was relieved to see Uchka sitting in the corner holding the children in her lap . It took me a while to realize that everyone was beaming . // Mama finally sighted me . She rushed towards me with her arms out . ' Who knew ? Who knew ? ' // I asked , ' Who knew what ? ' I could n't imagine what had put such smiles on their faces . But everyone actually looked happy , which surely meant that nobody had died or been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what she was talking about . // ' You mean the entire town has n't heard yet ? Clarutchka , ' she said , every word ripe with pride , ' out of all the children in Zolkiew , not only was your little sister chosen to sing the lead aria in the spring concert , but she was the youngest ! Can you imagine ? Mania ! The youngest ! And a lead aria ! Who knew ? ' // Never in a million years would I have thought I would be hearing Mama crow about this . Not now , not ever ! Mania was always pulling rabbits out of the hat of her life . We did n't even know that she had been asked to audition ! I was as giddy as the rest of them . Who could have known that my little stick of a sister could really sing ? We sang at holidays . We sang our children 's songs at school . But an aria ? From a real opera ? What a blessing to have such a talent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to celebrate the superiority of the Soviet system . Even Dzadzio , Grandfather , who never had a kind word for the Russians , said , ' At least they got this right . ' Apparently , the Russians knew something we did n't about my baby sister . On the other side of the room , Mania was sitting on the baby bed where she slept . I could tell what she was thinking just by the look on her face . She would rather be out sledding while there was still snow on the ground and was ruing that she had brought up the concert at all . But it was like all the other things she had to confess to . Better to get it over with . Sooner or later Mama would have got it out of her anyway . She could n't see the glory in it . She had been told to sing , so she would sing . // For the next three months , all we got was humming . Humming while she jumped rope . Humming while she ran in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the homework she hated . The one time Mama asked her to sing , Mania refused . She was as wilful as Mama , Babcia and Dzadzio . We would have to wait for the concert . // The entire town was temporarily distracted from the Russian occupation . While waiting on the long lines which stretched outside the colonnaded shops , mothers bragged about the Ukrainian and Russian folk songs their children would be singing . There was n't a loaf of bread to be found , but the air practically buzzed with gossip . I knew they were secretly keeping score . Which song was longer ? Whose child was singing the favourites ? Who had a solo and who was in the chorus ? What would the mothers wear ? //
