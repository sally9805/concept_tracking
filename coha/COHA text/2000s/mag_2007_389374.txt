A lifelong passion and its pitfalls . All my life I 've loved canoes . I like anything that floats : inner tubes , float tubes , my Boat-in-a-Bag , rubber rafts , kayaks , yachts and even ships , although nothing larger than a light cruiser . ( Battleships and aircraft carriers are too hard to turn . ) But it 's only canoes that I love . Otherwise , I 'm fairly normal . Kayaks are fine , except I have trouble putting them on and taking them off . Yachts are great , too , but if the motor wo n't start and you become the sole source of power , they 're awfully hard to row . Also , they 're difficult to store in your garage . You can shove a canoe up into the rafters , but let 's see you try that with a yacht . There 's an old saying : " If you can afford a yacht , you can afford to moor it . " ( Actually the saying is n't all that old  --  only about five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life consists of never having owned a jet boat . It 's a terrible thing to admit , but there you go . Sometimes you simply become too distracted by work and other absurdities to focus on the important things in life . If reincarnation exists , I will definitely buy a jet boat my second time around , even if it means observers might shout out , " Look ! A squirrel driving a jet boat ! " There are certain risks to consider in regard to both jet boats and reincarnation . I once wrote a book titled They Shoot Canoes , Do n't They ? For nearly 30 years , canoe enthusiasts have been buying that book like crazy . They actually think it 's about canoes ! Ha ! I have n't gone back and read that book in nearly 30 years , so I 'm not sure what it is about . It may contain the story about how I came to propose to my wife . Then again , maybe not . I must confess that when I was young , I was very particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart , beautiful , unmarried and gainfully employed . A girl with the nickname of Bun had all those qualifications , and so one day I took her out for the final test  --  a canoe cruise down the North Fork of the Clearwater River in Idaho . At one point , the canoe swamped in rapids and Bun floated away , occasionally popping up through the white water on top of a towering wave . It was then that I noticed she was gathering up various flotsam of gear that had recently resided in the bottom of the canoe . Although I do n't regard it as an essential , I do appreciate tidiness in a spouse . At that very moment , I said , Bun 's the woman for me ! " On our honeymoon , I took Bun on a river-float trip in the rain . As she confessed later , it was then she had her first doubts about the whole institution of marriage . Rafting or canoeing rivers is a wonderful test for a spouse . Bun says so herself . But enough about romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three canoes . Being poor , I could not afford more . We lived close to a river at the time , so it was necessary to have a minimum of three canoes . One was a 13-footer , made of Kevlar , as I recall . The ad for it claimed it could be dropped off the top of a 10-story building and survive unharmed . If you are not into canoes , you might not realize how often you come upon something in a river resembling a 10-story building , the sighting of which is often announced by shouting , " Holy Bleep ! " That is a technical term often used in canoeing . Once a couple of my daughters took the canoe upriver . A windstorm arose , so they parked the canoe on the bank and walked home . If they are not particularly thoughtful of their father , they are at least sensible . Because it is quite easy for the wind to blow an empty canoe into the next state , I went up to get it . I was soon paddling back home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole front half tends to rise out of the water . This is especially bad in a strong wind . Despite my best efforts , the canoe soon began spinning like a top . I drifted downriver in this fashion , the canoe totally out of control . As I spun past my house , I noticed Bun standing on the dock , hair blowing , hands on hips . She shouted , " Are you crazy ! Stop fooling around out there and paddle in here ! " So you can see that canoes are n't foolproof when it comes to selecting a spouse . Another of my canoes was an 18-foot Old Town wood-and-canvas job . It was ancient but still gorgeous . The one problem was that the previous owner had covered the canvas with fiberglass . This atrocity became apparent when you had to snap the canoe up the last quarter inch or so onto a cartop carrier all by yourself . If you were n't careful , you could easily hook the canoe on your eyeballs . Once the canoe was on the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually became too old and feeble to snap it up that last quarter inch . Besides , the neighbors started complaining about my groans and grunts scaring their pets . The time had come to sell the canoe , and I eventually found a young man appropriately appreciative of this superb craft . I helped him load it on his cartop carrier . As I watched the canoe disappearing down my driveway , I gave it a sad little wave . Then I shouted to the young man one last little canoeing tip : " Watch out for your eyeballs ! " I am now reduced to owning a single canoe : a 17-foot , thin-skinned aluminum Grumman . It 's a bit battered but otherwise in excellent shape , and I can pop it onto the cartop carrier with ease . The two of us , the canoe and I , have shared many an excellent adventure . Once , during a hunting trip , my friend Retch Sweeney and I paddled it across a major Idaho lake in the middle of a late-November blizzard . The whole canoe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure now . As the bow paddler , I kept hearing this weird clicking sound , not especially unusual in a car but strange in a canoe . It turned out to be the chattering of Retch 's teeth . Not all of our canoe outings were so much fun , though . I first fell in love with canoes at about age 10 . I was fishing along the creek that ran through the back of our farm when I suddenly came upon a canoe tied to some brush in such a way that one might suppose its owner had attempted to hide it . Right away I guessed that it must belong to a teenage ruffian by the name of Buster . Despite his frequent threats to eradicate me from his life , I realized that Buster must be attempting amends by leaving such a fine canoe tied up on my side of the creek . Even after all these years , I possess a vivid image of that canoe . Clearly , Buster had built it himself , probably in no more than a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was covered with canvas , which the young builder had painted blue , apparently with house paint . Nevertheless , you could see the skeleton of the craft right through its taut skin . It was lovely . Buster had been thoughtful enough even to the extent of leaving a paddle for me to use . Glancing about to make sure there were no immediate threats to my life  --  bears occasionally passed through our farm  --  I slid down the bank and into the canoe . I quickly cleared away the brush that covered it , wondering all the while why Buster would choose to be so careless with his property . I soon found the canoe much easier to paddle downstream than up , I do n't know why . After a test float of a few hundred yards , and finding it extremely difficult to paddle back to the craft 's original berth , I steered over to the bank and parked . Being a particularly thoughtful boy , I tied up the canoe in a place where Buster would have no trouble finding it . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wiped the canoe clean of my fingerprints , just in case Buster might be upset by someone 's borrowing it . I was right , too . My fingerprints gave me away , no doubt about it , because Buster immediately zeroed in on me as his number-one suspect . Boy , what I would n't have given for a Witness Protection Program back in those days , the days when I first fell in love with canoes .
