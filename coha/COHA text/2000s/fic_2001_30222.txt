Chapter OneJanet opened her eyes Florida 's prehistoric glare dazzled outside the motel window . A dog barked ; a car honked ; a man was singing a snatch of a Spanish song . She absentmindedly touched the scar from the bullet wound beneath her left ribcage , a scar that had healed over , bumpy and formless and hard , like a piece of gum stuck beneath a tabletop . She had n't expected her flesh to have healed so blandly What was I expecting , a scar shaped like an American flag ? Janet 's forehead flushed : My children where are they ? She did a rapid-fire tally of the where abouts of her three children , a ritual she 'd enacted daily since the birth of Wade back in 1958 . Once she 'd mentally placed her offspring in their geographic slots , she remembered to breathe : They 're all going to be here in Orlando today . She looked at the motel 's bed side clock : 7:03 A.M. Pillo'clock . She took two capsules from her prescription pill caddie and swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted like nickels and pennies . It registered on her that motel rooms now came equipped with coffee makers . What a sensible idea , so bloody sensible why did n't they do this years ago ? Why is all the good stuff happening now ? A few days back , on the phone , her daughter , Sarah , had said , ' Mom , at least buy Evian , OK ? The tap water in that heap is probably laced with crack . I ca n't believe you chose to stay there . ' ' But dear , I do n't mind it here . ' ' Go stay at the Peabody with the rest of the family . I 've told you a hundred times I 'll pay . ' ' That 's not the point , dear . A hotel really ought not cost more than this . ' ' Mom , NASA cuts deals with the hotels , and ... ' Sarah made a puff of air , acknowledging defeat . ' Forget it . But I think you 're too well off to be pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ! as were the two others . None had known poverty , and they 'd never known war , but the advantage had n't made them golden , and Janet had never gotten over this fact . A life of abundance had turned her two boys into an element other than gold lead ? silicon ? bismuth ? But then Sarah Sarah was an element finer than gold carbon crystallized as diamond a bolt of lightning frozen in midflash , sliced into strips , and stored in a vault . Janet 's phone rang and she answered it : Wade , calling from an Orange County lock-up facility . Janet imagined Wade in a drab concrete hallway , unshaven and disheveled , yet still radiating ' the glint ' the spark in the eye he 'd inherited from his father . Bryan did n't have it and Sarah did n't need it , but Wade had glinted his way through life , and maybe it had n't been the best attribute to inherit after all . Wade : Janet remembered being back home , and driving along Marine Drive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a bus to take him downtown . He 'd be slightly seedy and one or two notches short of respectability ; it was always patently clear he 'd lost his driver 's license after a DWI , but this only made him more interesting , and whenever Janet smiled at one of these men from her car , they fired a smile right back . And that was Wade and , in some unflossed cranny of her memory , her ex-husband , Ted . ' Dear , are n't you too old to be calling me from jail ? Even saying the word " jail " feels silly . ' ' Mom , I do n't do bad stuff any more . This was a fluke . ' ' Okay then , what happened did you accidentally drive a busload of Girl Guides into the Everglades ? ' ' It was a bar brawl , Mom . ' Janet repeated this : ' A bar brawl . ' ' I know , I know you think I do n't know how idiotic that sounds ? I 'm phoning because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car 's back at the bar . ' ' Where 's Beth ? Why does n't she drive you ? ' ' She gets in early this afternoon . ' ' OK . Well , let 's go back a step , dear . How exactly does one get into a bar brawl ? ' ' You would n't believe me if I told you . ' ' You 'd be amazed what I 'm believing these days . Try me . ' There was a pause on the other end . ' I got in a fight because this guy this jerk was making fun of God . ' ' God . ' He ca n't be serious . ' Yeah , well , he was . ' ' In what way ? ' ' He was being so nasty about it , saying , " God 's an asshole , " and " God does n't care about squat , " and he kept on going on and on , and I had to put a stop to it . I think he got fired that day . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . I was . ' Tread carefully here , Janet . ' Wade , I know Beth is very religious . Are you becoming religious , too ? ' ' Me ? Maybe . Nah . Yes . No . It depends on how you define religious . It keeps Beth calm , and maybe ... ' Wade paused . ' Maybe it can calm me , too . ' ' So you spent the night in jail , then ? ' ' Safely in the arms of a four-hundred-pound convenience store thief named Bubba . ' ' Wade , I ca n't pick you up . I think it 's going to be one of those no-energy days . And besides , the car I rented smells like a carpet in a frat house and the roads down here , they 're white , and the glare makes me sleepy . ' ' Mom , come on ... ' ' Do n't be such a baby . You 're forty-two . Act it . You could n't even get to the hotel in time yesterday . ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tampa . I stopped for a drink . Hey do n't treat me like I 'm Bryan . It was n't like I started the fight or ... ' ' Stop ! Stop right there . Call a cab . ' ' I 'm short on cash . ' ' Simple cab fare ? Then how are you paying for the hotel ? ' Wade was silent . ' Wade ? ' ' Sarah 's covering it for us until we can pay it back . ' An awkward silence followed . ' Mom , you could pick me up if you really wanted to . I know you could . ' ' Yes , I suppose I could . But I think you should phone your father down in ... what 's that place called ? ' ' Kissimmee and I already did call him . ' ' And ? ' ' He 's gone marlin fishing with Nickie . ' ' Marlin fishing ? People still do that ? ' ' I do n't know . I guess . I thought they were extinct . They probably have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marlin onto their line . ' ' Marlins are so ugly . They remind me of basement rec rooms that people built in 1958 and never used again . ' ' I know . It 's hard to imagine they ever existed in the first place . ' ' So he 's out marlin fishing with Nickie then ? ' ' Yeah . With Nickie . ' ' That cheesy slut . ' ' Mom ? ' ' Wade , I 'm not a saint . I 've been holding stuff inside me for decades girls my age were trained to do that , and it 's why we all have colitis . Besides , a dash of spicy language is refreshing every so often . Just yesterday I was hunting for information on vitamin D derivatives on the Internet , and suddenly , doink ! I land in the Anal Love website . I 'm looking at a cheerleader in a leather harness on the ' ' Mom , how can you visit sites like that ? ' ' Wade , may I remind you that you are standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-five-year-old woman discuss the Internet over a pay phone shocks you ? You would n't believe the sites I 've visited . And the chat rooms , too . I 'm not always Janet Drummond , you know . ' ' Mom , why are you telling me this ? ' ' Oh , forget it . And your stepmother , Nickie , is still a cheesy slut . Phone Howie maybe he can come fetch you . ' ' Howie 's so boring he makes me almost pass out . I ca n't believe Sarah married such a blank . ' ' I 'm the one who gave birth to her , and I 'm the one who has to drive with him to Cape Canaveral today . ' ' Ooh bummer . Another NASA do ? ' ' Yes . And you 're welcome to come along . ' ' Wait a second , Mom why are n't you at the Peabody with everybody else ? What are you staying in a motel for ? By the way , it took thirty rings for the clerk who , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . ' ' Wade , you 're changing the subject . Phone Howie . Oh wait I think I hear somebody at the door . ' Janet held the phone at arm 's length from her head , and said , ' Knock knock knock knock . ' ' Very funny , Mom . ' ' I have to answer the door , Wade . ' ' That 's really funny . I ' Click The motel room made her feel slightly too transient , but it was a bargain , and that turned the minuses into pluses . Nonetheless , Janet missed her morning waking-up rituals in her own bedroom . She touched her body gently and methodically , as though she were at the bank counting a stack of twenties . She gently rubbed a set of ulcers on her lips ' insides , still there , same as the day before , not just a dream . Her hands probed further downward no lumps in her breasts , not today but then what had Sarah told her ? We 've all had cancer thousands of times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body removed it . It 's lazy bookkeeping to only count the cancers that stick . You and I could have cancer right now , but tomorrow it might be gone . The motel room smelled like a lifetime of cigarettes . She looked at Sarah 's photo in the Miami Herald beside the phone , a standard NASA PR crew photo : an upper body shot against a navy ice-cream swirl background and complexion-flattering lighting that made one suspect a noble , scientific disdain for cosmetics . Sarah clutched a helmet underneath her right arm . Her left arm , handless , rested by her side : Space knows no limitations . Janet sighed . She twiddled her toes . Ten minutes later her phone rang again : Sarah calling from the Cape . ' Hi , Mom . I just spoke to Howie . He 'll go pick up Wade . ' ' Good morning , Sarah . How 's your day ? ' ' This morning we had a zero-G evacuation test , but what I really wanted to do was sit in a nice quiet bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The humidity in these suits is giving me killer blackheads . They never talked about that in those old Life magazine photo essays . Have you eaten yet ? ' ' No . ' ' Come eat at the Cape with me . We can have dehydrated astronaut 's ice cream out of a shiny Mylar bag . ' Janet sat up on her bed and pulled her legs over the side . She felt her skin her meat hanging from her bones as though it were so much water-logged clothing . She needed to pee . She began to meter her words as she eyed the bathroom door . ' I do n't think so , dear . The only time they ever allow me to have with you are three seconds for a photo op . ' Sarah asked , ' Is Beth arriving today ? ' Beth was Wade 's wife . ' Later this afternoon . I think I 'm going to dinner with the two of them . ' ' How far along is she ? ' ' I think this is her fourth month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huh . I see . ' ' Something wrong , Sarah ? ' ' It 's just that ' ' What ? ' ' Mom , how could Wade marry ... her . She 's so priggish and born-again . I always thought Wade would marry Miss Roller Derby . Beth is so frigging sanctimonious . ' ' She keeps him alive . ' ' I guess she does . When does Bryan arrive ? ' ' He and his girlfriend are already here . He called from the Peabody . ' ' Girlfriend ? Bryan ? What 's her name ? ' ' If I tell you , you wo n't believe me . ' ' It ca n't be that bad . Is it one of those made-up names like DawnElle or Kerrissa or CindaJo ? ' ' Worse . ' ' What could be worse ? ' ' Shw . ' ' I beg your pardon ? ' ' Shw . That 's her name : Shw . ' ' Spell that for me . ' ' S. H. W. ' ' And ? ' ' There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . ' ' What her name is Shw ? Am I pronouncing that properly ? ' ' I 'm afraid so . ' ' That is the most ... impractical name I 've ever heard . Is she from Sri Lanka or Finland or something ? ' Janet 's eye lingered on the bathroom door and the toilet beyond . ' As far as I know she 's from Alberta . Bryan worships her , and she 's also knocked up like a prom queen . ' ' Bryan 's pregnant ? How come I do n't know any of this ? ' ' I just met her last week myself , dear . She seems to rather like me , though she treats everybody else like dirt . So I do n't mind her at all , really . ' ' Bryan is such a freak . I 'm not going to be able to keep a straight face , you know when she tells me her name , that is . ' Janet said , ' Shw ! ' Sarah giggled . ' Shw ! Shw ! Shw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Sort of . She 's also about eighteen and an angry little hornet . In the fifties we would have called her a pixie . Nowadays we 'd call her hyperthyroid . She 's bug-eyed . ' ' Where 'd they meet ? ' ' Seattle . She helped Bryan set fire I believe to a stack of pastel-colored waffle-knit T-shirts in a Gap back during the World Trade Organization riots . They were separated , then a few months ago they met again destroying a test facility growing genetically modified runner beans . ' Janet could sense Sarah changing gears ; she was finished discussing the family . Next would come business-like matters : ' Well , good for Bryan . You 're OK for today 's NASA gig ? ' ' Still . ' ' Howie will pick you up at 9:30 , after he picks up my darling brother . By the way , Dad 's broke . ' ' That does n't surprise me . I 'd heard he 'd lost his job . ' ' I tried to loan him some money , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's much to loan . Howie lost the bulk of our savings in some website that sells products for pets . I could strangle him . ' ' Oh dear . ' It 's so easy to fall into the mother mode . ' Tell me about it . Hey , when was the last time you even saw Dad ? ' ' Half a year ago . By accident at Super-Valu . ' ' Tense ? ' ' I can handle him . ' ' Good . See you there . ' ' Yes , dear . ' Click On the walkway outside her room , Janet heard children mewling as they set off to Walt Disney World with their families . She walked to the bathroom across a floor made lunar from eons of cigarette burns and various stains better left uninvestigated . She thought of serial murderers using acids to dissolve the teeth and jawbones of their victims . She unsuspectingly caught sight of herself in a floor-length mirror by the sink and the sight stopped her cold . Yes , Janet , that 's correct : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein molecule you are turning into an ... an elf , yes , you , Janet Drummond , once voted ' Girl We 'd Rob a Bank For . ' She was transfixed by the view of herself in a blue nightie , as if she were once again young and this image had been delivered to her from the future as a warning If I squint I can still see the cool immaculate housewife I once dreamed of becoming . I 'm Elizabeth Montgomery starring in Bewitched . I 'm Dina Merrill lunching at the Museum of Modern Art with Christina Ford . Oh forget it . She peed , showered , dried and then modified those traces of time 's passage on her face that she could . There . I 'm not so bad after all . A man might still rob a bank for me , and men still do flirt not too frequently and older men perhaps but the look in the eyes never changes . She dressed , and five minutes later she was a block away sitting in a Denny 's reading a paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a rich , unhealthy crimson , with only a small strip of cool green running up the coast from Seattle to Alaska . Outside the restaurant window the sun on the parking lot made the area seem like a science experiment . She realized she no longer cared about the weather . Next . Back in her motel room , she lay down on the bed haunted by a thousand sex acts . OK this place is creepy but at least I 'm not throwing away money . Her lips were sore to the point that speech was painful , and it hurt to exhale . Her pill buzzer buzzed ; she sat up . She reached into her purse and removed a prescription bottle . She turned on the TV , and there was Sarah being interviewed on CNN . As always , her daughter looked glowingly pretty on TV , like a nun who 'd never touched makeup . Do you think you and children like you , born with damage caused by thalidomide , have other messages to tell the world ? Of course . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first children born in which it was proved that chemicals from the outside world in our case thalidomide could severely damage the human embryo . These days , most mothers do n't smoke or drink during pregnancy . They know that the outer world can enter their babies and cause damage . But in my mother 's generation , they did n't know this . They smoked and drank and took any number of medications without thinking twice . Now we know better , and as a species we 're smarter as a result we 're aware of teratogens . Teratogens ? Yes . It means ' monster forming ' . A horrible word , but then the world can be a horrible place . They 're the chemicals that cross the placenta and affect a child 's growth in utero . The host turned to the camera : ' Time for a quick break . I 've been speaking with Sarah Drummond-Fournier , a one-handed woman , and one heck of a fighter , who 'll be on Friday 's shuttle flight . We 'll be right back . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child ? I understand nothing about her life . Nothing . And yet she 's the spitting image of me , and she 's gallivanting up into space . Janet remembered how much she 'd wanted to help the young Sarah with her homework , and Sarah 's polite-but-resigned invitations to come do so when Janet popped her head into Sarah 's doorway . Invariably Janet would look down at the papers that might as well have been in Chinese . Janet would ask a few concerned questions about Sarah 's teachers , and then plead kitchen duty , beating a hasty retreat . She turned off the TV . She once cared about everything , and if she could n't muster genuine concern , she could easily fake it : too much rain stunting the petunias ; her children 's scrapes ; stick figure Africans ; the plight of marine mammals . She considered herself one of the surviving members of a lost generation , the last generation raised to care about appearances or doing the right thing to care about caring . She had been born in 1934 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Detroit bland , methodical , thrifty and rules-playing . Her father , William Truro , managed the furniture and household appliance department of the downtown Eaton 's department store . William 's wife , Kaye , was , well ... William 's wife . The two raised Janet and her older brother , Gerald , on $29.50 a week until 1938 , when a salary decrease lowered William 's pay to $27 a week , and jam vanished from the Truro breakfast table , the absence of which became Janet 's first memory . After the jam , the rest of Janet 's life seemed to have been an on going reduction things that had once been essential vanishing without discussion , or even worse , with too much discussion . Seasons changed . Sweaters became ragged , were patched up and became ragged again , and were grudgingly thrown out . A few flowers were grown in the thin band of dirt in front of the brick row house , species scavenged by Kaye for their value as dried flowers , which scrimped an extra few months ' worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about scrimping . In fall of 1938 , Gerald died of polio . In 1939 the war began and Canada was in it from the start , and scrimping kicked into overdrive : bacon fat , tin cans , rubber all material objects were scrimp-worthy . Janet 's most enjoyable childhood memories were of sorting neighborhood trash in the alleys , in search of crown jewels , metal fragments and love notes from dying princes . During the war , houses in her neighborhood grew dingy paint became a luxury . When she was six , Janet walked into the kitchen and found her father kissing her mother passionately . They saw Janet standing there , a small , chubby , fuddled Campbell 's Soup kid , and they broke apart , blushed , and the incident was never spoken of again . The glimpse was her only evidence of passion until womanhood . An hour passed and Janet looked at the bed side clock : almost9:30 , and Howie would have already picked up Wade by now . Janet walked down to the hotel 's covered breezeway to wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pow ! she was angry all of a sudden . She was angry because she was unable to remember and re-experience her life as a continuous movie-like event . There were only bits of punctuation here and there the kiss , the jam , the dried flowers which , when assembled , made Janet who she was yet there seemed to be no divine logic behind the assemblage . Or any flow . All those bits were merely ... bits . But there had to be logic . How could the small , chubby child of 1940 imagine that one day she 'd be in Florida seeing her own daughter launched into outer space ? Tiny little Sarah , who was set to circle the Earth hundreds of times . We did n't even think about outer-space in 1939 . Space did n't exist yet . She removed a black felt Sharpie pen from her purse , and wrote the word ' laryngitis ' on a folded piece of paper . For the remainder of the day she would n't have to speak to anybody she did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No Howie 's not the late type .
