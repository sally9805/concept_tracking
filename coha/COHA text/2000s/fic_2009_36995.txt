A parrot squawked and its multicolored wings blurred as it exploded from its perch in the lowest branches of the tree . The bird 's shriek was close enough to the cry of a woman being murdered that the expedition froze in startled anticipation of violence . <p> Austin Fargo 's hand dropped to the massive revolver on his hip , his other tightened around the handle of the machete frozen in midstroke at a green branch barring his progress . It took several minutes before the explorers had recovered enough composure to breathe steadily . <p> Had this been sooner on their journey , Fargo would have relaxed his tightly wound nerves with a laugh , but the hard rubber checkering on his handgun dug into the pads of his fingers and his throat was so tight that he almost choked . Two days earlier , when the expedition set out , Fargo was looking for a gold mine of technology , the materials that the Millennial Consortium would need to wrest control from such adversaries as the rebels of Cerberus redoubt or the Tigers of Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consortium an edge in creating their new empire . Which was why Austin Fargo had twenty trained soldiers and twice that many technicians on hand . The hundred bearers packing their supplies were paralyzed with worry , and only Fargo 's display of stern discipline kept the lot of them from deserting the human train as it crawled through the uncharted forest . <p> It was one thing to be cut in two by the snarl of a Calico machine pistol , and even the slash of a machete brought a quick demise . The coiled loops of leather that hung on Fargo 's hip , on the other hand , peeled flesh from the body in inch-wide strips , one lash at a time . The Indian deserter whom Fargo had singled out was a giant , six and a half feet with a barrel chest , and long arms and legs as solid as tree limbs . Fargo took his time , peeling the big Indian 's skin off with the crack of tightly woven leather . After an hour and a half , Fargo 's arm started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bared ribs and shoulder blades gleaming where the whip had flayed skin and muscle away . <p> The deserter had been reduced to a gibbering mass , a once powerful man stripped of his strength by the cruelty of Fargo 's whip . Eyeless sockets cried tears that flowed in crimson rivers down his cheeks . The bearer begged for death , for an end to the pain . Finally , well into the third hour of his exhibition , Fargo wound the whip back up , hanging it on the metal hook in his belt . Somewhere in those last few minutes of lashing leather , blood loss or shock had stilled the big man 's heart . <p> Thoughts of rebellion were crushed . Fargo would make them pay , and the display of violence was foremost in the thoughts of the Indians laden with the expedition 's supplies . <p> That should have been enough to keep everyone well behaved , but then the ghost sightings began . Humanoid shadows flitted in the darkness just beyond the path that the expedition carved in the forest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was spilled by the chattering weapons . Fargo hated to call the stalkers ghosts , but the only other whispered explanation came from the primitives who had borne the supplies on this arduous trek . They called the shadows Nagah , legendary snake creatures that lived beneath the surface of the world , interacting with men only when they chose to . Fargo was well acquainted with the idea of reptilian humans from his adventures in England to interactions with the Annunaki overlords and their scaled Nephilim slaves . The snake men , with their hinged and poisonous fangs , were feared by the natives of postskydark India . <p> The Kashmir region had for centuries been a contested territory , warred over by the nations of India and Pakistan for strategic purposes and for the vast agricultural benefits it had provided . While Fargo saw evidence of ancient combines , overgrown and now conquered by weeds and new tree growth , he could n't imagine this land as farmland . It was too empty , too abandoned . On the other side of the forest , the remnants of Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their side of the edge of the forest . No one even went to the tree line to harvest logs to create more housing in the snarled shantytown . To leave such resources untouched nagged at Fargo . <p> A shadowy figure , manlike in size and shape , stepped onto the trail ahead of him . At first , the millennialist thought it was a figment of his overactive imagination . His fingers wrapped around the black rubber grips of his .45-caliber revolver as he realized it was more than just a phantom . Gleaming yellow eyes , partially obscured by a silhouetted hood , flashed as the figure 's nod acknowledged Fargo 's attention . <p> " Have you not listened to the men you have enslaved ? " came a harsh , sibilant challenge . <p> " I come to you representing the Millennial Consortium . I am here to make contact with the keepers of a trove reported in this area . We are a peaceful group , seeking to negotiate a deal with you , " Fargo answered . His thumb rested on the teardrop-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fast draw . The challenger 's golden-yellow eyes flicked down to his hand . <p> " You 're well armed for a mission of peace , " the hissing silhouette noted . <p> " I 'd be a fool to come unarmed into a nation filled with tribal feuds and bandits , " Fargo stated . " And in the south , there are violent cultists . " <p> " They call themselves the Nagas , " the shadowy sentinel added . " They believe themselves to be like unto us . " <p> The jungle grew silent around them , as quiet as a tomb as birds and insects became too frightened to chirp . The shadowed , amber-eyed stranger was not alone . Odds were that the expedition was surrounded . Fargo glanced back to the Calico-toting millennialist enforcers and nodded . <p> Safety catches clicked off with the chatter of a sudden metallic rainstorm . <p> " This can either be peaceful or painful . " Fargo 's words punctuated the chatter of twenty machine pistols going from rest to wakeful readiness . " Your choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have gotten off on the wrong foot , " the tall figure said . He stepped into a shaft of sunlight piercing down from the forest canopy . " My name is Durga , prince of the true-blooded Nagah . " <p> Fargo watched Durga flip back the hood of his long , formless black cloak . Rising from his shoulders like a trapezoidal Central American pyramid , Durga 's head and slender neck were blended into a flat , powerful sheet of muscle that instantly solidified the truth of the legendary cobra men of India . Save for the folds of the cloak that clung to broad , powerful shoulders , Durga was naked to the waist , his chest laden with large segmented plates in a paler hue than the scales that adorned his arms , face and ribs . The belly armor was the color of age-stained bone , while the smaller , finer scales glimmered metallic blue and green , shimmering almost like silk . The cobra man 's yellow eyes remained locked on Fargo , and his thin , scaled lips were turned up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and introduce yourselves . Slowly and politely , " Durga added as an afterthought . <p> Perhaps as many as thirty similarly cloaked figures strode from the shadows of the trees . <p> Like their self-proclaimed true-blooded prince , they were lean , slender figures . All were hairless , though not all of them had the perfect sheens of snakelike armor that their leader sported . On the Nagah men who were n't completely reptilian , bared patches of human flesh seemed like swollen , discolored rashes rather than normal sunburned flesh . Scales twinkled like dew-wet grass amid the untransformed flesh . <p> Fargo thought back to the semireptilian guardsmen in England , men genetically augmented to be more than human . The Englishmen so transformed looked pathetic in comparison to the powerful , graceful , cobra-hooded Nagah that Fargo looked upon now . The explorer wondered if the treatments of Lord Strongbow were clumsily copied from whatever procedure created the snake men he now encountered . <p> " Make your weapons friendly , lads , " Fargo called out . " Muzzles down but triggers hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precaution . " <p> Durga shrugged . His lean , powerful shoulders flexed , making his segmented chest plates ripple over tight pectoral and abdominal muscles . " Understandable . We are strangers . Indeed , we are obscenely alien to your mammal eyes . " <p> Fargo shook his head . " Not completely . I have met others who have transformed themselves , but not as well as you have . " <p> Durga nodded . " Ah , yes . The Englanders . Strongbow had sent scouts to seek a refinement of his crude process . We greeted them as brothers , but sadly , our lost relatives once more were lost . It is no wonder that our appearance does not panic you . " <p> Fargo glanced back to his millennialist allies . He could hear the hushed whispers of Indians speaking among themselves in Hindi . " No . Not completely . " <p> Durga 's thin lips pursed in frustration . " Such a shame . " <p> Fargo read the disappointment in the cobra man 's words . Where the rest of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anticipation of hell unleashed . <p> Durga took one step forward , but by then , Fargo had sidestepped , barely avoiding the slashing rake of unhinging fangs in the Nagah 's mouth . A spray of fluid issued from Durga 's venom sacks as they squeezed themselves out , disgorging their deadly payloads . <p> Fargo cracked his whip across Durga 's flat face , a blow that would have lacerated any normal man down to the gleaming , bloody white bone beneath . It was a fast-draw slash that had split faces open from forehead to chin in the past . Instead , one yellow eye was clamped shut and Durga stumbled off balance . <p> The whip crack preceded the discharge of a half-dozen Calicos , but dozens of other men screamed in agony as venom seared into tear ducts and mucus membranes , burning like acid . Fargo whirled and bolted into the foliage , realizing that the poison-blinded guards and bearers had been neutralized . <p> The explorer trusted only two things to get him out of harm 's way  --  his booted feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting distance between himself and the savage hisses behind him . Out of his peripheral vision , he could see the sinewy Nagah lunging at blinded , agonized humans , curved knives and distended jaws slashing into pink and brown flesh alike . Dagger and fang carved through human skin , cutting agonized wails short . <p> " Him ! " Durga bellowed . " Get that miserable ape and drag him before me ! " <p> Fargo noticed one millennialist unaffected by the gushing clouds of vision-destroying venom . His machine pistol hammered loudly , bullets chopping one snake man who staggered but still continued to advance . Mere handgun rounds deflected off the tough chest plate armor of the Nagah , though hits to the finer scales of the arms and thighs betrayed bloody swathes where copper-jacketed lead tore the weaker reptilian armor . Fargo left the fool to stand his ground , charging toward the frontier . The millennial gunman stopped firing , and the guard 's fate was broadcast by a strangled death cry as hinged jaws and folding fangs stretched into a face-piercing lethal bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed by the coordinated assaults of the Nagah 's ambush force . <p> Behind him , Fargo could hear the snap of branches and rustle of leaves . That could only mean that others were rushing through the thickets after him . As no bullets speared through the foliage , it had to be the knife- and fang-armed Nagah . The cobra-hooded warriors were in hot pursuit of the fleeing archaeologist . <p> Move , he commanded himself , legs pumping . Vaulting over roots , rocks and ruts with the ease of a man who 'd run for his life across six continents , Fargo avoided tripping and stumbling . The Nagah hunters behind him snagged their feet on vines or stepped into open space where they expected solid ground . The snake men 's yellow eyes had been focused on Fargo , not the ground before them . For a moment , the archaeologist was elated that , despite their venom and tough scales , they were as fallible and clumsy as any human . The crack of a rifle , accompanied by the eruption of a tree trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make use of modern tools to slay their foes . <p> Fargo changed course and allowed gravity to drag him down a muddy hillside . He rocketed to the bottom of the slope and sprang into a dead run through a copse of trees . Rifles chattered behind him , but Fargo kept up his frantic pace . Soon the single shots changed to fully automatic fire as machine guns were added to the mix . <p> Fargo plowed on , ricochets pinging and whining all around him . Trunks thumped as they caught the storm of bullets meant for him . He remembered his mental map , visualizing a steep cliff bordering off into a turgid river . It had forced the expedition to change its course by five miles , slowing the trek to a tedious crawl . He remembered that the height of the drop-off was around forty feet . <p> Boots filled with sloshing mud , wet pant legs clinging to his calves and thighs , Fargo knew his pace would rapidly slow off from constriction and lack of sure footing . One misstep would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While he would consider himself likely to catch an instantly fatal bullet , the ideal outcome was a splash in the river , its powerful current carrying him south and away from the serpentine assassins on his tail . <p> On foot , the Nagah warriors would not be able to keep up and shoot at Fargo at the same time , he suspected . The trees thinned out and the ground began to slope . Fargo 's mud-caked boots turned into wet slicks , his footing dissolving into an arm-windmilling effort at balance as gravity whipped him into a wild slide . The rattle and crack of bullets around him faded as the slope pulled him below the arc of fire laid out by the cobra men . The skid downhill came to a sudden end as Forgo rocketed out into the air over the roiling waters beneath . <p> There was an odd , queasy moment of weightlessness as Fargo sailed to the waters . The surface of the river shimmered like ribbons of living , writhing glass . The world had gone silent around him , an envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race for his life . The snake men had stopped firing , it seemed , and in his peripheral vision , the millennialist trespasser knew why . Just before he knifed into the river , he had caught sight of a helicopter hanging over the tree line like a bloated , mechanical bee . <p> Fargo plunged under the surface of the roiling river , momentum pushing him nearly to the bottom as the water exerted its braking force on him . The current shoved hard , toppling him into a spin that he kicked out of , arms and legs dragging him toward the silty bottom . <p> With a twist , he looked up through the surface of the river , seeing the warped image of the sky and ledge hanging over him . Fargo knew that he had barely a minute before his lungs forced him to surface , but cold dread of that helicopter stilled his urge to swim upward . <br> Continues ...
