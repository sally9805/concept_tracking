So here comes the Terminator on a mission to sweep out the dastardly Democrats and restore truth and justice in California , and here in Minnesota we watch the show with a delicious vicarious pleasure . We invented the action-hero Governor . We wrote that particular comic book . And now California , so often on the cutting edge , is following in our footsteps . Us , a little dairy and turkey-raising state on the upper Mississippi . This is great . It 's like the townsfolk in Huckleberry Finn who attended the Duke and Dauphin 's theatrical show and then told their neighbors how great it was , so they could go and be snookered too . <P> Of course , the Terminator is no Jesse ( the Body ) Ventura . The Body was a troubled soul who , we discovered in the course of four years that got longer and longer , truly despised politics and the limelight and growled and ranted and threw snits and went and sulked in his tent . He was like the turkeys that are bred for white meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their little ankles and have to be kept in hammocks and fed through a tube . He was something of an embarrassment . The Terminator is a charming man with a geezer brain trust of Warren Buffett and George Shultz , and the three of them may give Gray Davis , who was too clever for his own good , his comeuppance . But I doubt the Terminator would win if he were running in Minnesota . We 've seen that movie already , and we wanted to leave after the first 20 minutes . <P> After four years of an action-hero Governor , it 's a relief to go back to politics as usual , where soft-spoken people with ordinary chest sizes sit down and do the work . Mr. Ventura was replaced by a cheerful , well-spoken , nonfamous Republican , and everyone felt a sense of relief . An action hero works well within a simple story structure , but politics is n't a story ; it 's a process . It 's not about confrontation and threat and revenge and triumph . It 's mostly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissariat of Motor Vehicles and on up to the folks in the black robes . Most men and women in politics are there because they genuinely like people and want to do good things on their behalf . It 's hard work , and fury is n't the best motivation . You have to sit through the meetings , listen to other people and say your piece and be civil about it . Anger and loathing are losing hands in politics . George McGovern was a decorated war hero who got hit by more political garbage than anybody , but he is today the same good and thoughtful man he always was , and that 's victory . <P> You do n't hear this from AM radio , which is packed with angry men with chain-saw voices chewing into liberals 24/7 , or from Ann Coulter , who is selling the old Stalinist line that dissent equals disloyalty . Or from the aging adolescents at Fox News , who enjoy peeing in the political swimming pool . But when you get among the real people who are actually engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the process and the humanity of those who take part . That 's the difference between entertainment and politics . Of course , the Terminator could choose to go this route , and if he did , he could be a good Governor and make up for all the god-awful movies . There is always that hope .
