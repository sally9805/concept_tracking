After each one of John Gabay 's 26 lonely , harrowing missions flying over German-occupied Europe , he recorded what he had seen . // JOHN GABAY 'S MISSIONS usually consisted of several boring , sub-freezing hours interrupted by an hour or two of pure terror . Flak hit his B-17 nearly every time he flew . The 23  --  yer-old staff sergeant from Brooklyn watched far too many Flying Fortresses and their crews tumble to earth , and three of the planes in which he 'd flown-Sweaty Betty , Passionate Witch II , and Miss Donna Mae H-were eventually shot down . During his five-month air war , 52 of his barracks mates did n't return to their bunks . Gabay was not oblivious to the destruction his unit , the 94th Bomb Group , 331st Bombardment Squadron , 8th Air Force , was causing below , nor did he deny combat 's thrilling moments . Here are excerpts from his always candid ( and often ghastly ) record . GELSENKIRCHEN , GERMANY 11/5/43 ( B-17 382- Horrible Hanks ) Target : Ruhr Valley refineries Temp : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ET ( time over enemy territory ) : 1:35 ALTITUDE : 28,000 feet WE WENT OVER HOLLAND and immediately saw three Me ( Messerschmitt ) 109s . Later on we saw ten FW ( Focke-Wolf ) 190s , two Ju ( Junkers ) 88s , Photograph // one Me 110 , and then several more 109s . I fired at a 109 coming in at 6 o'clock .... Flak was very intense and pretty accurate ( fourteen solid minutes ) . Our ship was hit several times ( two holes in left wing flaps , several in fuselage , severed oil line in number three engine and bent prop ) . Oil covered ball turret and wheels . I could hear pieces of flak hit-concussion driving the ship several feet upward .... A waist gunner got the bends . He screamed with the pain . Now the 109s moved in for another battle . My guns worked perfectly . I was holding them off pretty good .. our P-47s met us and scattered the enemy fighters . We lost one bomber in that last fight . Bombs went through the wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was my first raid and it was with an old crew . They had twenty-four missions and were uneasy to have a rookie flying tail gun . But when we landed , they all came back and shook hands with me and said I did OK . MUNSTER , GERMANY 11/11/43 ( B-17 846-Lucky 13 ) Target : Marshalling yards in heart of city - 28 deg FT:6:00 ET:1:55 Alt. : 24,000 ... OUR ESCORT STAYED AS LONG as they could-engaging in several dogfights . They had to leave us over Holland and then the fun began . About 50 FW 190s and Me 109s attacked us from every direction . We could n't close our bomb-bay doors so they picked on us thinking we were crippled . One FW dove straight down from 1 o'clock high and let go with his cannons . He put a hole in our left wing big enough to crawl through . He also blew off a piece of the vertical stabilizer over my head . The Fort on our wing burst into flames and only five got out-one chute was on fire . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and I know I hit him as he rolled over in a dive and disappeared . Another came in low at 8 o'clock and Chauncey Ben Carriere , our ball gunner , hit him and he burst into flames and went down . Several FW 190s kept coming in at the tail and I hit one .... The Fort on our other wing burst into flames and went into a spin . Did n't see any chutes . Flak burst under our ship and concussion knocked us up about fifty feet ... a FW 190 followed up tow at 5 o'clock and Chauncey knocked him into the water . We made it back OK but our new ship was a wreck ... our crew 's first raid together . PARIS , FRANCE 11/26/43 ( B-17-798 ) Target : Ball-bearing factory , Seine River - 36 deg FT : 6:30 ET:1:35 Alt. : 24,000 FIVE MINUTES AFTER CROSSING THE CHANNEL ... number four engine was going bad and had to be feathered but we continued .... We got a big flak hole in the tail coming out of the target area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I called the pilot and he dropped our ship and then pulled up quickly . It was quite a jolt-our radioman almost went through the top hatch . The waist gunner floated through the air and both landed on the ball turret , disconnecting their oxygen hoses . My ammunition came out of the boxes and hit me in the head .... We could no longer keep up with the formation so we had to leave and go down . Our low group got hit hard by several FW 190s and Me 109s ... one B-17 got hit and was burning badly . He left the formation , then blew up-bombs and all . The crew were good friends . By this time we were all alone over enemy territory , and our number one engine started to go bad . We were struggling to reach the Channel with the probability of ditching .... Meanwhile seven FW 190s came out of nowhere . They stalked us just out of range , then broke off as we reached the Channel ... then our number one engine died . We made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We got back OK . BREMEN , GERMANY 11/29/43 ( 6-17 846- Lucky 13 Target : Docks in city - 64 deg FT : 7:45 ET : 2:20 Alt. : 28,500 Photograph Opposite : While he was primarily a tail gunner , John Gabay occasionally flew as the waist gunner on the B-17 , the coldest position on the aircraft . // ... FLAK WAS HEAVY . Ship on our left had its wing blown off ... fighters hit us hard . Our P-47 escort jumped on them and the battle began . I called out a Me 210 at S o'clock low to Chauncey : he almost got him . I fired at an FW 190 and saw him blow up just as a P-47 pulled over the tail ... dogfights all over the sky . Vapor trails were heavy and broke up our formation .... Our commo and radio compass were shot out . I never saw so many different types of enemy fighters ... about 150 in all , trying to outdo each other . It must have been an Iron Cross day . Ju 87s tried dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . It felt like the ship would come apart .. I know I hit a few as I saw several break off and dive . We made it back OK , but I had frostbite on my face , chin , and knees . They wanted to put me in the hospital but I went into a fit and got off with only one day grounding . Went to confession .... KIEL , GERMANY 12/13/43 ( Lucky 13 ) Target : Heart of city - 28 deg FT : 8:10 ET : 0:56 Alt. : 24,200 ... FORTY JU 88S APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE ... four of them attacked our ship from the tail ... one at a time . The flame from the cannons , tracers from their machine guns , and rockets from under their wings made the situation a bit hairy . All I could do , besides being scared , was to spray each one as they came in and call for evasive action . I hit the second one ... he rolled over and burned . I saw my tracers slam into the cockpit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ship started to go out of control . I poured more into it , knocking off the canopy .... It looked like a leg hung out of the ship for an instant , then fell out . Then the ship went into a spin . More Ju 88s flew alongside us , out of range . Some of them waved to us . It was shaky waiting for them to attack . Then they came at us ... all guns were firing . The ball turret in the ship next to us was blown out . Several ships were hit hard . We had several flak holes and a couple of 20mm-cannon holes .. Leo was annoyed that I did n't put in any claims . I do n't like the hassle . Today-Dec. 13th ; Our Crew-#13 ; Bombs Away-1300  --  Another Lucky Day . BREMEN , GERMANY 12/16/43 ( B-17-037 ) Target : Docks in city - 38 FT : 8:30 ET : 1:30 Alt. : 24,000 WHEN WE SAW THE P-38s , they were passing us on their way home-not a nice feeling .... The sky was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my oxygen mask . The noise was cruel and concussions were murderous . Every ship in the group must have had flak holes-we had plenty .. fighters were waiting for us . I never saw so many .... Our crew led the Eighth Air Force on this raid . We had two direct attacks at the tail .... The low group in our wing got hit very hard . One of the Forts blew up . The Jerry that got him gave some exhibition of flying . He was something special .... The weather over the Channel was bad .... We made the landing on the first try but nearly collided with another Fort .... Our ship was a mess  --  full of holes . I thought the crew chief was going to cry . We were told at interrogation that Bremen put up more flak today than any city up to now . Big Deal ! Got back OK ! BORDEAUX , FRANCE 1/5/44 ( Lucky 13 ) Target : Airdrome , plant - 35 deg FT : 7:45 ET : 4:30 Alt : 20,300 ... A LONE 109 ATTACKED A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till we started the bomb run . Then the flak came , heavy and accurate . I could hear ... chunks of steel ripping into the ship-a sickening sound . Fighters came through their own flak and attacked us . We were flying Purple Heart Corner low outside position again and the FW 190s attacked our ship in threes and fours . I know I damaged some . It was a running fight for almost an hour . We lost an engine and could not keep up with the group . About the same time another Fort lost an engine and we both hung together till we reached the Brest peninsula , then he could n't stay with us and lagged back . When he was about 800 yards back , two black-and-silver FW 190s attacked him and blew him in half .. then both fighters came at us at 6 o'clock level . I poured it to them-a wing came off one and the other burst into flames . The pilot insisted I claim them .... We were all alone-then I saw a Fort below us ditch . We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( B-17 498- Passionate Witch II ) Target : Me 110 factory - 26 deg FT : 7:30 ET : 3:45 Alt. : 21,000 THE LAST TIME the Eighth Air Force went to Brunswick they lost sixty Forts . Today , only twenty .... WILHELMSHAVEN , GERMANY 2/3/44 ( Lucky 13 ) Target : Sub pens - 47 deg FT : 7:00 ET : 1:30 Alt. : 24,500 .. THE LAST THING I SAW before the weather enveloped us was a Fort running into the tail of another and chewing it up so bad the gunner fell out over the North Sea . I could n't see anything else as the weather closed in around us . We dove at great speed trying to get to warmer air . The ice soon broke away from the wings and we did n't hit anything-so far so good ! FRANKFURT , GERMANY 2/8/44 ( Passionate Witch II ) Target : Heart of city - 47 deg FT : 8:40 ET : 4:00 Alt. : 27,500 ... FLEW AT PRETTY HIGH ALTITUDE . As soon as we started our bomb run I saw a group of Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye on them and in so doing , pulled out my oxygen hose without knowing it . I passed out and hit my head on the armor plate . But before I passed out , I vaguely remember trying to plug the end of the hose back where it belonged , but I just could n't reach it . I thought it was hanging out the rear of the ship for several miles and I kept trying to pull it back in . The flight surgeon said a man could only live for about ten minutes without oxygen at this altitude , but according to the crew , they were trying to contact me for over twenty minutes . Bill Geier waist gunner crawled back to the tail and found me slumped over , no oxygen and my face purple . He gave me emergency oxygen and artificial respiration as best he could . I started breathing again . When I came to , I tried to fight with him but I had no strength ... was groggy all the way home .... Crew said I was shooting at fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabay 's certificate of membership in the " Lucky Bastard Club ! " Above , left : Gabay and crew debrief after a raid on Berlin in 1944 .

I 'm very tired . The plan was to send 200 Forts deep into Germany as a decoy to lure enemy fighters so our escort could try to knock out the Luftwaffe . It did n't turn out that way .. we ran into swarms of enemy fighters . ( At interrogation everyone agreed over 300 fighters at one time pounded our group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 of our escort showed up and immediately dropped their belly tanks so they could mix it with the enemy . That meant they could n't stay with us very long-and the raid was just beginning . The Luftwaffe must have put up every fighter they had .... Fighters hit us from every angle . I saw Forts and fighters blowing up ... smoking and burning , wings coming off , tails coming off , the sky full of parachutes .... One guy floated into a low Fort-he was churned up by the propellers and took the Fort with him .... The sky was full of tracers , 20mm cannon shells exploding , and even rockets . Steel was ripping into our ship with sickening sounds . There were times when I was afraid to shoot for fear of hitting one of our own planes or some poor guy in a parachute . We were leading the high squadron , 9 planes-only two of us got back . They attacked the tail 4 abreast , 4 deep , 16 at a time . Their wing guns lit up like Luna Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P-47s at times were badly outnumbered but they did a great job .... When they left , enemy fighters became even more aggressive-if that was possible . All guns were firing .. the whole ship was vibrating .... I think I hit a few but was too busy to see what happened as another attack was already starting , then another , etc . I know Chauncey got an FW 190 .... At one time there must have been 200 fighters above us in dogfights . I saw 2 P-47s go down and several Jerries . ... Forts and fighters were going down all around us . Our ship got slammed with 20mm cannon and machine-gun slugs  --  a miracle none of us were hit . At the end of the battle , 20 P-47s showed up and put up a magnificent battle . Flak over the target was heavy .... We made it back OK . But there are a lot of empty beds tonight . This old Fort really took a beating .. half the nose blown out ; six feet of the vertical stabilizer blown off , tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20mm went through left side of tail above my hands and blew up just outside my window ... ground crew counted 136 holes . REGENSBURG , GERMANY 2/25/44(B-17-704) Target : Aircraft plant and ball-bearing factory - 26 deg FT : 10:30 ET : 5:45 Alt. : 14,000 to 17,000 ANOTHER LONG HAUL INTO THE FATHERLAND .... We ran into several flak areas in France . I was flying with a different crew and felt uneasy ... two Forts went down-nine chutes came out of one and three from the other . The second Fort went out of control and the fighters would n't give the crew a chance to bail out . It caught fire and went into a steep dive . Wings and tail fell off and I saw the fuselage hit the ground . These raids lately are too low-the flak gets more accurate .... The Reich was covered with snow , a pretty sight-peaceful and quiet looking .... As soon as we started our bomb run , the flak really came up .. saw an eager 109 come at us through the flak . I poured a long burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dive .... One Fort was blown up by flak-no one got out . We started our long haul back , no escort ... could see Frankfurt and Stuttgart burning from previous raid . Saw a lot of smoking Forts .... Over France , we were hit hard .... Flak ripped through our nose , wing , windshield , and tail-getting a wee bit nervous . ... I did n't care too much for the crew I was with today . They got too darned excited under fire . I ca n't stand that-had to keep telling them to simmer down . But we made it OK . BERUN , GERMANY 3/6/44 ( B-17 252-Sweaty Betty ) Target : Heart of city - 26 deg FT : 8:40 ET : 4:35 Alt. : 21,000 I 'VE FINALLY GOT MY WISH-a raid on Big B .... It was just like any other rough raid over the Reich , except we got a double Scotch at interrogation and had our pictures taken when we landed .... The sky above us was full of vapor trails in one massive dogfight . Several fighters were knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us lost eight Forts ... parachutes filled the sky-could n't keep track as fighters came at us . Then the Sls came and everybody was shooting at somebody . What a mess ! As we started our bomb run , heavy flak filled the sky . I could hear every burst , and the steel hitting our ship and the ship jolting up and down and sideways with the concussions . I saw the city-big and beautiful and then it was burning . What a shame ! We dropped our bombs and got the heck away as soon as we could , as the flak was murder . Our left wing was hit bad . Saw several Forts go down over the target . I think the flak is beginning to get on my nerves . Tonight BBC said the Eighth lost 68 bombers .... MUNICH , GERMANY 3/18/44 ( Sweaty Betty ) Target : Rail yard - 32 deg FT : 10:05 ET : 5:45 Alt. : 20,000 ... WE RAN THE GAUNTLET OF FLAK and fighters from Augsburg to Munich . Flew the waist again today . Too dull-not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pieces of steel ricocheting inside the ship , the loud noises .. the jostling of the plane , the wishing I was somewhere else . A few seconds after the bombs dropped , a burst of flak exploded outside my gun position , knocking me flat on my back , cutting the gun barrel in half , and destroying the armor plate . No one was hit-I do n't know why ! A foot higher and I would have lost my head . BRUNSWICK , GERMANY 3/23/44 ( B-17-925 ) Target : Heart of city - 38 deg FT omitted ET : 3:05 Alt. : 21,000 MY PILOT FINISHED UP ON THE LAST RAID , so today I flew with a new pilot ... a real stiff .... The crew were new and inexperienced and they really showed it . They kept tying up the intercom with a lot of nonsense till I lost patience and told them to stay off the wire unless they had something important to say . It worked for a while . Deep in Germany , ahead of schedule and no escort in sight , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . They flew in fours , just like our escort . I tried to convince the crew that those fighters were FW 190s but they insisted they were P-47s . ... Just then a bunch of fighters , Me 109s , came up from below and attacked ... I saw three Forts go down burning on the first pass . Then the fighters from above dove and the fun began . I warned the crew they were enemy fighters but I was the only one shooting . Two Forts went down quickly and several others were hit , including ours . It was a rude awakening to the crew . All the time the dumb pilot was VHF instead of intercom and could n't hear attacks called out . The Fort on our right wing was hit and burst into flames . It rolled over and almost collided with us . It blew up a few seconds later . No one got out .... Our escort came just as the Jerries hit us again . One Fort in our group was blown in half .... We took several hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw six get out . Then the flaming ship went out of control . It slid right through the group . All of the Forts pulled up but ours as the dopey pilot was still on VHF , and could n't hear me call . The burning ship just missed the tail ... It leveled off-four more got out , then it rolled over and broke up . We made it back OK . No thanks to the pilot , and I sure told him so . CHERBOURG , FRANCE 3/26/44 ( Passionate Witch II ) Target : Rocket sites - 26 deg FT : 5:00 ET : 0:20 Alt. : 20,500 ... THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE my last mission but have to make one more as they raised them to thirty . Since I had twenty-three when they upped them , I only have one more to go . CAZAUX , FRANCE 3/27/44 ( Miss Donna Mae H ) Target : Airdrome -5 deg FT : 9:15 ET : 4:50 Alt. : 12,000 ... A HEAVY FOG ROLLED IN . Takeoff was delayed two hours .... What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off and could barely see the wingtips .... We were all sweating . Finally broke through at 10,000 feet ... France was as clear as a bell . I saw fires and smoke on the ground where other bombers hit . But we had another two and a half hours to target .... German warships threw some flak up-inaccurate . There were scattered dogfights all the way down .... At this low altitude we should n't miss . Hangars went up and so did the oil dump . Plenty of heavy smoke . Not much flak . We crossed Brest and some 109s dove out of the sun and hit us hard . Saw one Fort go down . Got in some shooting-not very good . P-47s arrived and scattered the Jerries . Ca n't believe this is the last mission ... Had a celebration in the barracks . I was the first to finish from the barracks-fifty-two did n't make it .
