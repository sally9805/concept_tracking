Lately , I 've been spending a lot of time rolling on the ground with men who think a stiffy represents personal growth . The rolling around has nothing to do with my sex life . The rolling around is what happens when a bust goes crapolla and there 's a last ditch effort to hog tie a big , dumb bad guy possessing a congenitally defective frontal lobe . My name is Stephanie Plum , and I 'm in the fugitive apprehension business ... bond enforcement , to be exact , working for my cousin Vincent Plum . It would n't be such a bad job except the direct result of bond enforcement is usually incarceration ? and fugitives tend to not like this . Go figure . To encourage fugitive cooperation on the way back to the pokey I usually persuade the guys I capture to wear handcuffs and leg shackles . This works pretty good most of the time . And if done right , cuts back on the rolling around on the ground stuff . Unfortunately , today was n't most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing 5 ' 8 " tall , was arrested for credit card fraud and for being a genuinely obnoxious person . He failed to show for his court appearance last week , and this put Martin on my Most Wanted List . Since Martin is not too bright , he had n't been too hard to find . Martin had , in fact , been at home engaged in what he does best ... stealing merchandise off the internet . I 'd managed to get Martin into cuffs and leg shackles and into my car . I 'd even managed to drive Martin to the police station on North Clinton Avenue . Unfortunately , when I attempted to get Martin out of my car he 'd tipped over and was now rollingaround on his belly , trussed up like a Christmas goose , unable to right himself . We were in the parking lot adjacent to the municipal building . The back door leading to the docket lieutenant was less than fifty feet away . I could call for help , but I 'd be the brunt of cop humor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did n't trust Paulson . He was royally pissed-off , red-faced and swearing , making obscene threats and horrifying animal sounds . I was standing there , watching Paulson struggle , wondering what the hell I was going to do , because anything short of a fork-lift was n't going to get Paulson up off the pavement . And just then , Joe Juniak pulled into the lot . Juniak is a former police chief and is now mayor of Trenton . He 's a couple years older than me and about a foot taller . Juniak 's second cousin , Ziggy , is married to my cousin-in-law Gloria Jean . So we 're sort of family ... in a remote way . The driver side window slid down , and Juniak grinned at me , cutting his eyes to Paulson . " Is he yours ? " " Yep . " " He 's illegally parked . His ass is over the white line . " I toed Paulson , causing him to start rocking again . " He 's stuck . " Juniak got out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't mind if I embellish this story when I spread it all over town , do you ? " " I do mind ! Remember , I voted for you , " I said . " And we 're almost related . " " Not gon na help you , cutie . Cops live for stuff like this . " " You 're not a cop anymore . " " Once a cop , always a cop . " Paulson and I watched Juniak get back into his car and drive away . " I ca n't walk in these things , " Paulson said , looking down at the shackles . " I 'm gon na fall over again . I have n't got a good sense of balance . " " Have you ever heard the bounty hunter slogan bring em back  - -  dead or alive ? " " Sure . " " Do n't tempt me . " Actually , bringing someone back dead is a big no-no , but this seemed like a good time to make an empty threat . It was late afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with my life . Spending another hour coaxing Paulson to walk across the parking lot was n't high on my list of favored things to do . I wanted to be on a beach somewhere with the sun blistering my skin until I looked like a fried pork rind . Okay , truth is at this time of year that might have to be Cancun , and Cancun did n't figure into my budget . Still the point was , I did n't want to be here in this stupid parking lot with Paulson . " You probably do n't even have a gun , " Paulson said . " Hey give me a break . I have n't got all day for this . I have other things to do . " " Like what ? " " None of your business . " " Hah ! You have n't got anything better to do . " I was wearing jeans and a T-shirt and black Caterpillar boots , and I had a real urge to kick him in the back of his leg with my size seven Cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promised my parents I 'd be home for dinner at six . " Paulson burst out laughing . " That 's pathetic . That 's fucking pathetic . " The laughter turned into a coughing fit , Paulson leaned forward , wobbled side to side and fell over . I reached for him , but it was too late . He was back on his belly , doing his beached whale imitation . * * * My parents live in a narrow duplex in a chunk of Trenton called the Burg . If the Burg was a food , it would be pasta  - -  penne rigate , ziti , fettuccine , spaghetti , and elbow macaroni , swimming in marinara , cheese sauce or mayo . Good , dependable , all-occasion food that puts a smile on your face and fat on your butt . The Burg is a solid neighborhood where people buy houses and live in them until death kicks them out . Backyards are used to run a clothesline , store the garbage can and give the dog a place to poop . No fancy backyard decks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porches and cement stoops . The better to see the world go by . I rolled in just as my mother was pulling the roast chicken out of the oven . My father was already in his seat at the head of the table . He stared straight ahead , eyes glazed , thoughts in limbo , knife and fork in hand . My sister Valerie , who had recently moved back home after leaving her husband , was at work whipping potatoes in the kitchen . When we were kids Valerie was the perfect daughter . And I was the daughter who stepped in dog poo , sat on gum , and constantly fell off the garage roof in an attempt to fly . As a last ditch effort to preserve her marriage , Valerie had traded in her Italian-Hungarian genes and turned herself into Meg Ryan . The marriage failed , but the blond Meg shag persists . Valerie 's kids were at the table with my dad . The nine year old , Angie , was sitting primly with her hands folded , resigned to enduring the meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The seven year old , Mary Alice , the kid from hell , had two sticks poked into her brown hair . " What 's with the sticks ? " I asked . " They not sticks . They 're antlers . I 'm a reindeer . " This was a surprise because usually she 's a horse . " How was your day ? " Grandma asked me , setting a bowl of green beans on the table . " Did you shoot anybody ? Did you capture any bad guys ? " Grandma Mazur moved in with my parents shortly after my Grandpa Mazur took his fat clogged arteries to the all-you-can-eat buffet in the sky . Grandma 's in her mid-seventies and does n't look a day over ninety . Her body is aging , but her mind seems to be going in the opposite direction . She was wearing white tennis shoes and a lavender polyester warm-up suit . Her steel gray hair was cut short and permed to within an inch of its life . Her nails were painted lavender to match the suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I brought in a guy wanted for credit card fraud . " There was a knock at the front door , and Mabel Markowitz stuck her head in and called , " Yoohoo " . My parents live in a two family duplex . They own the south half , and Mabel Markowitz owns the north half , the house divided by a common wall and years of disagreement over house paint . Out of necessity , Mabel 's made thrift a religious experience , getting by on social security and government surplus peanut butter . Her husband , Izzy , was a good man but drank himself into an early grave . Mabel 's only daughter died of uterine cancer a year ago . The son-in-law died a month later in a car crash . All forward progress stopped at the table , and everyone looked to the front door , because in all the years Mabel had lived next door , she 'd never once yoohooed while we were eating . " I hate to disturb your meal , " Mabel said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute to stop over , later . I have a question about this bond business . It 's for a friend . " " Sure , " I said . " I 'll be over after dinner . " I imagined it would be a short conversation since everything I knew about bond could be said in two sentences . Mabel left and Grandma leaned forward , elbows on the table . " I bet that 's a lot of hooey about wanting advice for a friend . I bet Mabel 's been busted . " Everyone simultaneously rolled their eyes at Grandma . " Okay then , " she said . " Maybe she wants a job . Maybe she wants to be a bounty hunter . You know how she 's always squeaking by . " My father shoveled food into his mouth , keeping his head down . He reached for the potatoes and spooned seconds onto his plate . " Christ , " he mumbled . " If there 's anyone in that family who would need a bail bond , it would be Mabel 's ex-grandson-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with some bad people these days . Evelyn was smart to divorce him . " " Yeah , and that divorce was real nasty , " Grandma said to me . " Almost as nasty as yours . " " I set a high standard . " " You were a pip , " Grandma said . My mother did another eye roll . " It was a disgrace . " * * * Mabel Markowitz lives in a museum . She married in 1943 and still has her first table lamp , her first pot , her first chrome and Formica kitchen table . Her living room was newly wallpapered in 1957 . The flowers have faded but the paste has held . The carpet is dark oriental . The upholstered pieces sag slightly in the middle , imprinted with asses that have since moved on ... either to God or Hamilton Township . Certainly the furniture does n't bear the imprint of Mabel 's ass as Mabel is a walking skeleton who never sits . Mabel bakes and cleans and paces while she talks on the phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapping her thigh , wiping her hands on her apron . Her hair is thin and grey , cut short and curled . Her face is powdered first thing in the morning to a chalky white . Her lipstick is pink and applied hourly , feathering out into the deep crevices that line her mouth . " Stephanie , " she said , " how nice to see you . Come in . I have a coffee cake . " Mrs. Markowitz always has a coffee cake . That 's the way it is in the Burg . Windows are clean , cars are big and there 's always a coffee cake . I took a seat at the kitchen table . " The truth is , I do n't know very much about bond . My cousin Vinnie is the bond expert . " " It 's not so much about bond , " Mabel said . " It 's more about finding someone . And I fibbed about it being for a friend . I was embarrassed . I just do n't know how to even begin telling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She cut a piece of coffee cake and shoved it into her mouth . Angry . Mabel was n't the sort of woman to comfortably fall victim to emotion . She washed the coffee cake down with coffee that was strong enough to dissolve a spoon if you let it sit in the cup too long . Never accept coffee from Mrs. Markowitz . " I guess you know Evelyn 's marriage did n't work out . She and Steven got a divorce awhile back , and it was pretty bitter , " Mabel finally said . Evelyn is Mabel 's granddaughter . I 've known Evelyn all my life , but we were never close friends . She lived several blocks away , and she went to Catholic school . Our paths only intersected on Sundays when she 'd come to dinner at Mabel 's house . Valerie and I called her The Giggler because she giggled at everything . She 'd come over to play board games in her Sunday clothes , and she 'd giggle when she rolled the dice , giggle when she moved her piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got dimples . And when she got older , she was one of those girls that boys love . Evelyn was all round softness and dimples and vivacious energy . I hardly ever saw Evelyn any more , but when I did there was n't much vivacious energy left in her . Mabel pressed her thin lips together . " There was so much arguing and hard feelings over the divorce that the judge made Evelyn take out one of these new child custody bonds . I guess he was afraid Evelyn would n't let Steven see Annie . Anyway , Evelyn did n't have any money to put up for the bond . Steven took the money that Evelyn got when my daughter died , and he never gave Evelyn anything . Evelyn was like a prisoner in that house on Key Street . I 'm almost the only relative left for Evelyn and Annie now , so I put my house here up for collateral . Evelyn would n't have gotten custody if I did n't do that . " This was all new to me . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracked down were in violation of a bail bond . Mabel wiped the table clean of crumbs and dumped the crumbs in the sink . Mabel was n't good at sitting . " It was all just fine until last week when I got a note from Evelyn , saying she and Annie were going away for awhile . I did n't think much of it , but all of a sudden everyone is looking for Annie . Steven came to my house a couple days ago , raising his voice and saying terrible things about Evelyn . He said she had no business taking Annie off like she did , taking her away from him and taking her out of first grade . And he said he was invoking the custody bond . And then this morning I got a phone call from the bond company telling me they were going to take my house if I did n't help them get Annie back . " Mabel looked around her kitchen . " I do n't know what I 'd do without the house . Can they really take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told Mabel . " I 've never been involved in anything like this . " " And now they all got me worried . How do I know if Evelyn and Annie are okay ? I do n't have any way of getting in touch . And it was just a note . It was n't even like I talked to Evelyn . " Mabel 's eyes filled up again , and I was really hoping she was n't going to flat-out cry because I was n't great with big displays of emotion . My mother and I expressed affection through veiled compliments about gravy . " I feel just terrible , " Mabel said . " I do n't know what to do . I thought maybe you could find Evelyn and talk to her ... make sure her and Annie are all right . I could put up with losing the house , but I do n't want to lose Evelyn and Annie . I 've got some money set aside . I do n't know how much you charge for this sort of thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private investigator . I do n't take on private cases like this . " Hell , I 'm not even a very good bounty hunter ! Mabel picked at her apron , tears rolling down her cheeks , now . " I do n't know who else to ask . " Oh man , I do n't believe this . Mabel Markowitz , crying ! This was at about the same comfort level as getting a gyno exam in the middle of Main Street at high noon . " Okay , " I said . " I 'll see what I can do ... as a neighbor . " Mabel nodded and wiped her eyes . " I 'd appreciate it . " She took an envelope from the sideboard . " I have a picture for you . It 's Annie and Evelyn . It was taken last year when Annie turned seven . And I wrote Evelyn 's address on a piece of paper for you , too . And her car and license plate . " " Do you have a key to her house ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me one . " " Do you have any ideas about where Evelyn might have gone ? Anything at all ? " Mabel shook her head . " I ca n't imagine where she 's taken off to . She grew up here in the Burg . Never lived any place else . Did n't go away to college . Most all our relatives are right here . " " Did Vinnie write the bond ? " " No . It 's some other company . I wrote it down . " She reached into her apron pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper . " It 's True Blue Bonds , and the man 's name is Les Sebring . " My cousin Vinnie owns Vincent Plum Bail Bonds and runs his business out of a small storefront office on Hamilton Avenue . A while back when I 'd been desperate for a job I 'd sort of blackmailed Vinnie into taking me on . The Trenton economy has since improved , and I 'm not sure why I 'm still working for Vinnie , except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices downtown , and his operation makes Vinnie 's look like chump change . I 've never met Sebring but I 've heard stories . He 's supposed to be extremely professional . And he 's rumored to have legs second only to Tina Turner . I gave Mabel an awkward hug , told her I 'd look into things for her , and I left . My mother and my grandmother were waiting for me . They were at my parent 's front door with the door cracked an inch , their noses pressed to the glass . " Pssst , " my grandmother said . " Hurry up over here . We 're dying . " " I ca n't tell you , " I said . Both women sucked in air . This went against the code of the Burg . In the Burg , blood was always thicker than water . Professional ethics did n't count for much when held up to a juicy piece of gossip among family members . " Okay , " I said , ducking inside . " I might as well tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationalize a lot in the Burg , too . " When Evelyn got divorced she had to take out something called a child custody bond . Mabel put her house up as collateral . Now Evelyn and Annie are off somewhere , and Mabel is getting pressured by the bond company . " " Oh my goodness , " my mother said . " I had no idea . " " Mabel is worried about Evelyn and Annie . Evelyn sent her a note and said she and Annie were going away for a while , but Mabel has n't heard from them since . " " If I was Mabel I 'd be worried about her house , " Grandma said . " Sounds to me like she could be living in a cardboard box under the railroad bridge . " " I told her I 'd help her , but this is n't really my thing . I 'm not a private investigator . " " Maybe you could get your friend Ranger to help her , " Grandma said . " That might be better anyway , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having him hang around the neighborhood . " Ranger is more associate than friend . Although , I guess friendship is mixed in there somehow , too . Plus a scary sexual attraction . A few months ago we made a deal that has haunted me . Another one of those jumping off the garage roof things , except this deal involved my bedroom . Ranger is Cuban-American with skin the color of a mocha latte , heavy on the mocha , and a body that can best be described as yum . He 's got a big-time stock portfolio , an endless inexplicable supply of expensive black cars , and skills that make Rambo look like an amateur . I 'm pretty sure he only kills bad guys , and I think he might be able to fly like Superman . Although , the flying part has never been confirmed . Ranger works in bond enforcement , among other things . And Ranger always gets his man . My black Honda CRV was parked curbside . Grandma walked me to the car . " Just let me know if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I always thought I 'd make a good detective on account of I 'm so nosey . " " Maybe you could ask around the neighborhood . " " You bet . And I could go to Stiva 's tomorrow . Charlie Shleckner is laid out . I hear Stiva did a real good job on him . " New York has Lincoln Center . Florida has Disney World . The Burg has Stiva 's Funeral Parlor . Not only is Stiva 's the premier entertainment facility for the Burg , it 's also the nerve center of the news network . If you ca n't get the dirt on someone at Stiva 's , then there is n't any dirt to get . * * * It was still early when I left Mabel 's , so I drove past Evelyn 's house on Key Street . It was a two family house very much like my parents . Small front yard , small front porch , small two story house . No sign of life in Evelyn 's half . No car parked in front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mazur , Evelyn had lived in the house when she 'd been married to Steven Soder and had stayed there with Annie when Soder moved out . Eddie Abruzzi owns the property and rents out both units . Abruzzi owns several houses in the Burg and a couple large office buildings in downtown Trenton . I do n't know him personally , but I 've heard he 's not the world 's nicest guy . I parked and walked to Evelyn 's front porch . I rapped lightly on her door . No answer . I tried to peek in the front window , but the drapes were drawn tight . I walked around the side of the house and stood on tippy toes , looking in . No luck with the side windows in the front room and dining room , but my snoopiness paid off with the kitchen . No curtains drawn in the kitchen . There were two cereal bowls and two glasses on the counter next to the sink . Everything else seemed tidy . No sign of Evelyn or Annie . I returned to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened , and Carol Balog looked out at me . " Stephanie ! " she said . " How the hell are you ? " I went to school with Carol . She got a job at the button factory when we graduated and two months later married Lenny Balog . Once in a while I run into her at Giovichinni 's Deli but beyond that we 've lost touch . " I did n't realize you were living here , " I said . " I was looking for Evelyn . " Carol did an eyeroll . " Everyone 's looking for Evelyn . And to tell you the truth , I hope no one finds her . Except for you , of course . Those other jerks I would n't wish on anyone . " " What other jerks ? " " Her ex-husband and his friends . And the landlord , Abruzzi and his goons . " " You and Evelyn were close ? " " As close as anyone could get to Evelyn . We moved here two years ago , before the divorce . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stupor at night . " " What kind of pills ? " " Prescription . For depression , I think . Understandable , since she was married to Soder . Do you know him ? " " Not well . " I met Steven Soder for the first time at Evelyn 's wedding , nine years ago , and I took an instant dislike to him . In my brief dealings with him over the following years I found nothing to change my original bad impression . " He 's a real manipulative bastard . And abusive , " Carol said . " He 'd hit her ? " " Not that I know . Just mental abuse . I could hear him yelling at her all the time . Telling her she was stupid . She was kind of heavy , and he used to call her the cow . Then one day he moved out and moved in with some other woman . Joanne Something . Evelyn 's lucky day . " " Do you think Evelyn and Annie are safe ? " " God , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over at Evelyn 's front door . " I do n't suppose you have a key ? " Carol shook her head . " Evelyn did n't trust anyone . She was real paranoid . I do n't think her grandma even has a key . And she did n't tell me where she was going , if that 's your next question . One day she just loaded a bunch of bags into her car and took off . " I gave Carol my card and headed for home . I live in a three story brick apartment building about ten minutes from the Burg ... five if I 'm late for dinner and I hit the lights right . The building was constructed at a time when energy was cheap and architecture was inspired by economy . My bathroom is orange and brown , my refrigerator is avocado green and my windows were born before Thermopane . Fine by me . The rent is reasonable , and the other tenants are okay . Mostly the building is inhabited by seniors on fixed incomes . The seniors are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you do n't let them get behind the wheel of a car . I parked in the lot and pushed through the double glass door that led to the small lobby . I was filled with chicken and potatoes and gravy and chocolate layer cake and Mabel 's coffee cake , so I bypassed the elevator and took the stairs as penance . All right , so I 'm only one flight up , but it 's a start , right ? My hamster , Rex , was waiting for me when I opened the door to my apartment . Rex lives in a soup can in a glass aquarium in my kitchen . He stopped running on his wheel when I switched the light on and blinked out at me , whiskers whirring . I like to think it was welcome home but probably it was who put the damn light on ? I gave him a raisin and a small piece of cheese . He stuffed the food into his cheeks and disappeared into his soup can . So much for room mate interaction . In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Trenton cop named Joe Morelli . Morelli 's two years older than I am , half a foot taller , and his gun is bigger than mine . Morelli started looking up my skirt when I was seven , and he 's just never gotten out of the habit . We 've had some differences of opinion lately , and Morelli 's toothbrush is not currently in my bathroom . Unfortunately , it 's a lot harder to get Morelli out of my heart and my mind than out of my bathroom . Nevertheless , I 'm making an effort . I got a beer from the fridge and settled in front of the television . I flipped through the stations , hitting the high points , not finding much . I had the photo of Evelyn and Annie in front of me . They were standing together , looking happy . Annie had curly red hair and the pale skin of a natural redhead . Evelyn had her brown hair pulled back . Conservative make-up . She was smiling , but not enough to bring out the dimples . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find them . * * * Connie Rosolli had a doughnut in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other when I walked into the bail bonds office the next morning . She pushed the doughnut box across the top of her desk with her elbow and white powdered sugar sifted off her doughnut , down onto her boobs . " Have a doughnut , " she said . " You look like you need one . " Connie is the office manager . She 's in charge of petty cash and she uses it wisely , buying doughnuts , file folders , and financing the occasional gaming trip to Atlantic City . It was a little after eight , and Connie was ready for the day , eyes lined , lashes mascaraed , lips painted bright red , hair curled into a big bush around her face . I , on the other hand , was letting the day creep up on me . I had my hair pulled into a half-assed pony tail and was wearing my usual stretchy little T-shirt , jeans and boots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like a dangerous maneuver this morning , so I was au naturel . I took a doughnut and looked around . " Where 's Lula ? " " She 's late . She 's been late all week . Not that it matters . " Lula was hired to do filing , but mostly she does what she wants . " Hey , I heard that , " Lula said , swinging through the door . " You better not be talking about me . I 'm late on account of I 'm going to night school now . " " You go one day a week , " Connie said . " Yeah , but I got ta study . It 's not like this shit comes easy . It 's not like my former occupation as a ' ho helps me out , you know . I do n't think my final exam 's gon na be about hand jobs . " Lula 's a couple inches shorter and a lot of pounds heavier than me . She buys her clothes in the petite department and then shoehorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , but it seems right for Lula . Lula shoehorns herself into life . " So what 's up ? " Lula said . " I miss anything ? " I gave Connie the body receipt for Paulson . " Do you guys know anything about child custody bonds ? " " They 're relatively new , " Connie said . " Vinnie is n't doing them yet . They 're high risk bonds . Sebring is the only one in the area taking them on . " " Sebring , " Lula said . " Is n't he the guy with the good legs ? I hear he 's got legs like Tina Turner . " She looked down at her own legs . " My legs are the right color but I just got more of them . " " Sebring 's legs are white , " Connie said . " And I hear they 're good at running down blondes . " I swallowed the last of my doughnut and wiped my hands on my jeans . " I need to talk to him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not only are n't you blonde , but you are n't exactly decked-out . You have a hard night ? " " I 'm not a morning person . " " It 's your love life , " Lula said . " You are n't getting any , and you got nothing to put a smile on your face . You 're letting yourself go , is what you 're doing . " " I could get plenty if I wanted . " " Well , then ? " " It 's complicated . " Connie gave me a check for the Paulson capture . " You are n't thinking about going to work for Sebring , are you ? " I told them about Evelyn and Annie . " Maybe I should talk to Sebring with you , " Lula said . " Maybe we can get him to show us his legs . " " Not necessary , " I said . " I can manage this myself . " And I did n't especially want to see Les Sebring 's legs . " Look here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm ready to go . " Lula and I stared at each other for a beat . I was going to lose . I could see it coming . Lula had it in her mind to go with me . Probably did n't want to file . " Okay , " I said , " but no shooting , no shoving , no asking him to roll up his pants leg . " " You got a lot of rules , " Lula said . We took the CRV across town and parked in a lot next to Sebring 's building . The bonds office was on the ground floor , and Sebring had a suite of offices above it . " Just like Vinnie , " Lula said , eyeballing the carpeted floor and freshly painted walls . " Only it looks like humans work here . And check out these chairs for people to sit in ... they do n't even have stains on them . And his receptionist do n't have a mustache either . " Sebring escorted us into his private office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " It was n't my fault that the funeral parlor burned down , " I told him . " And I almost never shoot people . " " We heard of you , too , " Lula said to Sebring . " We heard you got great legs . " Sebring was wearing a silver gray suit , white shirt and red , white and blue tie . He reeked of respectability , from the tips of his shined black shoes to the top of his perfectly trimmed white hair . And behind the polite politician smile he looked like he did n't take a lot of shit . There was a moment of silence while he considered Lula . Then he hiked his pants leg up . " Get a load of these wheels , " he said . " You must work out , " Lula said . " You got excellent legs . " " I wanted to speak to you about Mabel Markowitz , " I said to Sebring . " You called her on a child custody bond . " He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit her again today . So far , she has n't been helpful . " " She lives next door to my parents , and I do n't think she knows where her granddaughter or her great-granddaughter have gone . " " That 's too bad , " Sebring said . " Do you know about child custody bonds ? " " Not a lot . " " PBUS , which as you know is a professional bail bonds association , worked with the Center for Missing and Exploited Children to get legislation going that would discourage parents from kidnapping their own kids . " It 's a pretty simple idea . If it looks like there 's a good chance one or both parents will take off with the child for parts unknown , the court can impose a cash bond . " " So this is like a criminal bail bond , but it 's a child who 's bonded , " I said . " With one big difference , " Sebring said . " When a criminal bond is posted by a bail bondsman and the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond amount to the court . Then the bondsman can hunt down the accused , return him to the system and hopefully be reimbursed by the court . In the case of a child custody bond , the bondsman forfeits the bond to the wronged parent . The money is then supposed to be used to find the missing child . " " So if the bond is n't enough of a deterrent to kidnapping , at least there 's money to hire a professional to search for the missing child , " I said . " Exactly . Problem is , unlike a criminal bond , the child custody bondsman does n't have the legal right to hunt down the child . The only recourse the child custody bondsman has to recoup his loss is to foreclose on property posted at the time of the bond signature . " In this case , Evelyn Soder did n't have the cash on hand for the bond . So she came to us and used her grandmother 's house as collateral .
