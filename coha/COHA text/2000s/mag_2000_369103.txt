For Broadway theater , the new millennium has started on a note of musical diminuendo . With the demise of Cats , the soon-to-be-missing Miss Saigon and the lack of any new hits from Andrew Lloyd Webber or the Les Miz team in years , the era of the Brit-generated mega-musical seems all but over . Happily , straight plays seem to be filling the gap . Demanding dramas like Michael Frayn 's Copenhagen have become unlikely Broadway hits , while the Manhattan Theatre Club , an off-Broadway stalwart , successfully transferred two strong works , Proof and The Tale of the Allergist 's Wife , to the main drag this fall . With regional theaters thriving and even Las Vegas playing host to performance troupes like Blue Man Group , the stage is alive and bustling . <P> 1 BOY GETS GIRL With Spinning into Butter , her play about race relations on campus , Rebecca Gilman gave notice that she was a playwright to watch .

Heather Headley is a knockout , and Bob Crowley 's inventive sets will do until the next Julie Taymor comes along . <P> 4 FULLY COMMITTED A frazzled afternoon with the reservations clerk for a hot-hot-hot Manhattan restaurant . Becky Mode 's one-actor play ( a hit off-Broadway and now in L.A. ) is a tart and hilarious send-up of the social feeding frenzy . <P> 5 THE LARAMIE PROJECT The murder of gay student Matthew Shepard in Wyoming was the impetus for Moises Kaufman 's unique stage docudrama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A pioneering work of theatrical reportage and a powerful stage event . <P> 6 TANTALUS British theater titans Peter Hall and John Barton use the mythic Trojan War as the centerpiece of their adventurously scaled , sharply written satire of modern politics . This 10-hour marathon , which premiered in Denver , bristles with enough backstabbing drama to keep the slack moments few . <P> 7 PROOF David Auburn 's intriguing mix of memory play and math lesson concerns a professor 's daughter who may or may not have solved a famous math enigma . Of the year 's two brainy science plays ( the other : Copenhagen ) , this is the one that touches the heart . <P> 8 DINNER WITH FRIENDS Two couples see their friendship go sour when one of them gets a divorce . Donald Margulies ' perceptive , well-crafted , very contemporary play won the Pulitzer and is already popping up on the regional circuit . <P> 9 SEUSSICAL : THE MUSICAL The critics were grinches , but this musical of Dr. Seuss stories is surprisingly charming , with popsicle-colored sets , a tuneful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mishmash of Seuss-iana goes down easy . Green Eggs and Ham as a marching chant ? We like it , Sam-I-am.
