I had always heard that your 20s are your most fertile creative time ; few people have accomplished anything great after 30  --  not Einstein , not Newton , not Linda Lovelace . Now I know it 's true . At the age of 29 , I have tabled all ambitions to write a novel , play or episode of JAG . Even my planned autobiography , A Mildly Amusing Work of Limited Intellect , has been set aside . <P> To verify my deterioration , I signed up to take the SATs again so I could objectively compare my current self with my old , quite impressive , high school self , who got a score of 1480 . Anyone can sign up online , as long as he can come up with creative answers like " 34th grade . " I vowed to beat my 1480 without any preparation whatsoever , unless you consider that the SATs are designed to measure your preparedness for college and I had four years under my belt . But I would n't do any extra studying to beat my original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> I showed up at Xavier High School 15 minutes early on Saturday morning , which meant lots of time to be stared at by 17-year-olds . I felt creepy , like some intellectual pedophile . Actually , I felt like a real pedophile , but I tried to make myself feel better with the intellectual part . <P> Eventually I was ushered into a small room , where I was not only older than all the other test takers but also older than the teacher monitoring the test . A large carving of Jesus hung above the blackboard , and a copy of TIME magazine , in which I 'm pretty sure I mentioned masturbating , lay on a desk . I was sure I was going to hell . <P> As I had hoped , I breezed through the verbal section , in which the hardest vocabulary word was " megalomania , " which I had no trouble whatsoever defining . And the math section , which I had feared , did n't have any tangents or cosines and gave you all the geometry formulas you needed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil . I felt far more confident than the first time around , when I actually got a 1480 . <P> For the next three weeks , I bragged about how well I did , weakly hiding behind the second-person plural and pop sociology . " It turns out we are so much smarter than we were in high school , " I 'd say . " Not only our vocabulary but also our reasoning skills have developed exponentially . " With everyone I talked to , I seemed to strike some hidden nerve , revealing that not only do most people harbor a secret desire to retake the SATs but they also dislike being around me . <P> Then I got my scores back . I did indeed land a perfect 800 in verbal , but I got a 650 in math , for a total of 1450 . Worse yet , the College Board rigged the system in 1995 , so my score would have been worth only 1430 in 1988 . My brain had deteriorated nearly 5% , which is all you really use of your brain anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why I struggled on the math section . <P> At 17 , certain I had blown my SATs , I kept quiet about my test performance until I got my scores back . So while my brave experiment did confirm that now I am indeed dumber , it also revealed that I am much cockier . And that , I have learned in my brief working career , is a far more important predictor of success than intelligence .
