Perhaps you 've heard that Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , ex-Mr . Terror himself , is supporting President Bush 's war on Osama bin Laden . In an e-mail interview with TIME , the Libyan leader 's ambitious son , Seif al Islam ( Sword of Islam ) , or just Seif to his friends , elaborates : " The kind of terrorism that Libya was accused of is different from today 's terrorism . " How 's that ? Seif , 29 , an architect with a business degree who heads a charitable foundation , maintains that his father supported freedom fighters , like Nelson Mandela and Yasser Arafat , now given " red-carpet " treatment in the U.S. <P> Islamic fanatics , on the other hand , just want to kill people , including , it turns out , Gaddafi Sr. " They tried , many times , to assassinate the Leader , " he writes . Seif is brandishing an olive branch even as the U.S. extends sanctions against his father 's regime . He says that Libya longs to send students to American universities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and gas sectors and work with Washington to combat poverty and disease in Africa . " It is time we turned a new leaf , " he says . The main obstacle is Libya 's refusal to admit involvement in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 , which killed 270 . " Terrorism is terribly frightening , " Seif acknowledges , with nary a trace of irony . If only his father had thought of that . <P>  --  By Scott Macleod/Jidda
