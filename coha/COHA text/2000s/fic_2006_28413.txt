Edge of Danger By Cherry Adair Random House Cherry Adair Edridge Castle Montana Wednesday 0600 " I do n't give a damn if it 's a matter of national security or not , " Gabriel Edge savagely told the man he held at sword point . " I am not having sex with that woman . " The two men could have been sword fighting in medieval Scotland instead of twenty-first-century Montana . But both the castle and the heavy claymores the two T-FLAC operatives so expertly wielded were the real deal . For several minutes the only sounds in the Great Hall were their breathing , the clash of ancient steel and the soft sibilant shush of bare feet on stone . Swordplay was a well-choreographed dance , and they knew how to keep it interesting . Their blades slid against each other ritually as the men circled each other , feinting , testing for weakness , wait-ing for a split-second opening . Slightly better conditioned for a sport that required both strength and dexterity , Gabriel intentionally moved off balance to fool his opponent . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidestepped Sebastian Tremayne 's lightning-fast return thrust . Pleased with himself , Sebastian shot him a triumphant glance . " Your country nee --  " " Same tune . " From a high guard Gabriel made a strong downward cut , the blade of his broadsword flashing silver in the early morning sunlightstreaming through the high arched windows . He moved with a feline grace and speed that had Sebastian backing up . Fast . The first time Gabriel had set eyes on Dr. Eden Cahill he 'd felt this same cold clench in his gut . It was getting worse . " I 'll find another way , " he assured his friend grimly . And he would . As soon as he damn well came up with something that would work just as quickly , and just as well , as having sex with her . Sebastian almost took off Gabriel 's hand because he was so distracted . He 'd taught his friend well . " Good one . " He brought his attention back to the task at hand . Cutting back on the inhale , he halted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again . " You 're dead , " he said with satisfaction . They straightened and parted , each pausing to wipe the sweat from their eyes with their forearms . They were in hour two of practicing cuts and strikes . They 'd stop soon . But not yet . " Ready ? " Gabriel asked after a few moments ' rest , replacing both hands on the leather hilt of his sword . " Yeah . " Tremayne stepped back , sword raised . Agile and fast on his feet , Gabriel circled . The longer they practiced , the heavier the claymore seemed to become . That ten pounds felt more like fifty after wielding it for an hour . A good workout . Both for his body and his mind . " Been at it longer than you , " he pointed out , reading the familiar **47;935;TOOLONG glimmer in his friend 's eyes . They watched each other like hawks as they slowly circled one another . Waiting for an opportunity . Waiting for an opening . From a hanging guard , Sebastian brought down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet than you . " Knuckles white , Gabriel blocked . " You 'll have to be . " Tremayne was a little out of breath , Gabriel noticed with satisfaction . They were evenly matched , he was just better at hiding his uneven breathing than his friend was . Buttery light streamed through the leaded glass windows embedded in the thirteen-foot-deep walls . The Great Hall was constructed of rough-hewn stone the color of a good wine cork , and hung with enormous , priceless , centuries-old tapestries , coats of armor , ancient weaponry , and other objets d'art . One of Gabriel 's distant ancestors had built the castle in the Scottish Highlands for his young bride , Janet , in the first part of the fourteenth century . Had n't worked out too well for him , but Gabriel wanted to live in the castle that had housed seven hundred years of the Edridge family . They might no longer use the old Scottish name , but the castle would always be home . A man with his abilities could always get what he wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd gotten it . Using his wizard skills , he 'd teleported his ancestral home stone by bloody stone until it stood , stark and proud , hundreds of miles from civilization . Somewhere inside that foolish boy had lived the naive hope that , with the ancestral home in Montana , his father would venture from his native Scotland to be with his family more often . Magnus , unable to resist the lure of his Lifemate , had wanted Cait badly enough to ignore the Curse . Thinking he could change it , he married her . The first year had apparently been idyllic . Then things had turned to shit . Terrified that she would die due to his close prox- imity , Magnus had spent the next twenty years in exile from his beloved wife and their three sons . Once a year he 'd visit , but a series of near fatal accidents , or Cait 's failing health , would always compel him to leave . Their mother had been in ill health all their lives . She 'd wasted away , pining for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret it . Their parents ' frustration and unhappiness had been a stark lesson for Magnus 's three sons . Gabriel and his brothers were certain their parents had died of broken hearts . In five hundred years , no Edge had ever broken Nairne 's Curse . None ever would . Okay . He got it . He could marry someone he did n't love , but could never love the woman he married . Hell , he could never love . Period . No Lifemate . No three sons on three sons . No such fucking thing as happily ever after . Screw it . He had his work with T-FLAC . The counterterrorist organization was his life . His passion . It was enough . Between missions he relished the isolation , the ancient history , and the drafty halls of Edridge Castle . In a world filled with death and betrayal , the connection to his past kept him centered . In his daily life as a T-FLAC operative in the psi or paranormal branch , he used the most sophisticated high-tech military hardware coupled with ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the weapons hanging on the walls . Weapons his family had collected and used for centuries . His weapon of choice for today 's exercise was the claymore . Weighing close to ten pounds , and with an overall length of more than four and a half feet , the claymore was a formidable weapon . Despite its antiquity , the lethal sword could deliver great sweeping slashes or powerful thrusts . Just what he was in the mood for this morning . He 'd slept like shit last night , thinking about the good doctor . Or rather -- trying not to think about her . Narrow-eyed , Gabriel choked up on the leather- covered hilt with both hands as he anticipated his opponent 's next move . " If I could read minds , " Sebastian said , clearly flagging , " I 'd sleep with her . " " I 'm sure you would . " He used Sebastian 's distracted focus to springboard his riposte off his blade . And the game was back on . " But you ca n't , " he told his friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychic phenomena " branch . The psi division was considered , by some , to be the elite group of the counterterrorist organization . By others it was the whoo-hoo division that they did n't understand . None were permitted to acknowledge the group outside the organization . While there were still a few hundred known wizards in the world , the general population -- normal people -- were totally unaware that they even existed . And Gabriel and his brothers would n't even be wizards if not for that long-ago Curse . Jesus . Talk about a woman scorned . The witch Nairne had laid one on his cheating great , great , how ever many greats , grandfather , Magnus Edridge , several hundred years ago . The Edge family had changed their name , and had paid for the slight ever since . Thank God he and his brothers had decided that the Curse , like the proverbial buck , stopped with them . Not that any of them believed there was such a thing as a " Lifemate . " But they were n't taking any chances . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their business . The hours were long , their whereabouts frequently top secret . The three of them had long ago agreed that they 'd keep their relationships with the opposite sex casual . And if one of them should veer off the straight and narrow , the other two would pull him back from the abyss . In thirty-four years , Gabriel had never met a woman who tempted him to change the " casual " rule , not even a little . Until he 'd laid eyes on the gorgeous doctor Eden Cahill . He 'd been near her that once . It had been enough . He 'd taken one look . One . And been consumed by an unspeakable lust . It had been instantaneous , overwhelming , and dangerous as hell . He 'd wanted to breathe her breath , to absorb her distinctive scent , to learn her textures . He 'd hungered to taste her soft mouth , and run his hands over her silken skin . For the last three days he 'd been able to think of little else . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incrosada , the crossing of the blades , bringing both weapons to a bone-jarring , shuddering stop . The vibration shimmied up his arm . The very air reverberated with the sharp scraping sound of steel on steel echoing off the ancient stone walls . Their eyes met . Held . Not sleeping with her , he telegraphed as he gave a sharp twist of his wrist to indicate that his opponent should step back . Bloodlust raced through Gabriel 's body . Do n't think about her , he told himself , feeling feral and slightly out of control at the memory of Dr. Cahill 's glossy dark curls and her big brown eyes --
