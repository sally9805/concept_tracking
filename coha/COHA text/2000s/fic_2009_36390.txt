The Scilly Isles <p> May 1920 <p> Ronald Evering was in his study , watching a mechanical toy bank go through its motions , when the idea first came to him . <p> The bank had been a gift from a friend who knew he collected such things . It had been sent over from America , and with it in a small pouch were American pennies with which to feed the new acquisition , because they fit the coin slot better than the English penny . <p> A painted cast-iron figure of a fat man sat in a chair , his belly spreading his brown coat so that his yellow waistcoat showed , and one hand was stretched out to receive his bribe from political figures and ordinary citizens seeking his favor . His name was " Boss " Tweed , and he had controlled political patronage in New York City in the aftermath of the American Civil War . Through an alliance between Tammany Hall and the Democratic Party , graft had been his stock-in-trade . Now his image was encouraging children to be thrifty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ended , " Look on this as a swindler of sorts for the swindled , my dear Ronald , and take your revenge by filling his belly full of pennies , in time to recoup your pounds .... " <p> He had n't particularly cared for the tone of the note , and had burned it . <p> Still , the bank was a clever addition to his collection . <p> It had been a mistake to confide in anyone , and the only reason he 'd done it was to vent his rage at his own impotence . Even then he had n't told his friend the whole truth : that he 'd invested those pounds in order to look murderers in the face , to see , if such a thing existed , what it was that made a man a killer . In the end all he 'd achieved was to make himself known to two - people who had no qualms about deliberately cheating him . The explanation was simple-they wanted no part of him , and losing his money was the simplest way to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and it had become a personal affront . <p> He had sensed the subtle change in the air when he 'd first given his name , and cursed himself for not using his mother 's maiden name instead . But the damage was done , and he 'd been afraid to let them see what he suspected . <p> Yet it had shown him-even though he could n't prove it-that he 'd been right about them . What he did n't know was what to do with that knowledge . <p> Vengeance is mine , saith the Lord ... But the Lord had been remarkably slow exacting it . If anything , these two men had prospered . <p> And he had had no experience of vengeance . <p> There was only his mother , crying in his father 's arms , this quiet , unassuming woman fiercely demanding that whoever had killed her dear boy be punished . A ten-year-old , listening from the shadows of the stairs , shocked and heartbroken , had endured nightmares about that moment for years afterward . And it was his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Cape Town in 1911 , to bring her dear boy home from his South African grave . <p> " Your father could n't do it . But you must , " she 'd urged him time and again . " It 's your duty to Timothy , to me , to the family . Bring him home , let him lie beside your father in the churchyard , where he belongs . Find a way , if you love me , and let me see him resting there before I die ! " <p> Trying to shake off the memory , Evering took another penny from the pouch and placed it in Boss Tweed 's outstretched hand . <p> Almost quicker than the eye could follow , the hand slid the penny into the waistcoat pocket as Boss Tweed 's head moved to nod his thanks . <p> The man smiled . It was no wonder he preferred these toys to - people . He had come home from Cape Town with his brother 's body , after two years of forms and long hours in hot , dusty offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bargained for was the information he 'd collected along the way . Information he had never told his mother , but which had been a burden on his soul ever since . Almost ten years now . Because , like Hamlet , he could n't make up his mind what to do about what he knew . <p> Well , to be fair , not ten years of single-minded effort . <p> The Great War had begun the year after his return from South Africa , while he was still trying to discover what had become of those two men after they left the army . It was n't his fault that he 'd been stationed in India , far from home . But that had turned out to be a lucky break , for he discovered quite by accident where they were and what they were doing . In early 1918 he 'd been shipped back to London suffering from the bloody flux , almost grateful for that because he was able at last to look into the information he 'd come by in Poona . <p> Only he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It would n't do to brood on events again . That way lay madness . <p> On the shelves behind him was an array of mechanical and clockwork toys , many of them for adults , like the golden bird that rose from an enameled snuffbox to sing like a nightingale . <p> Banks were a particularly fine subject for such mechanical marvels . A penny tip to the owner sent a performing dog through a hoop . In another example , a grinning bear disappeared down a tree stump as the hunter lifted his rifle to fire . Humor and clever design had gone into the creation of each toy . The shifting weight of the penny set the device concealed in the base into motion , making the action appear to be magical . <p> He had always found such devices fascinating , even after he 'd worked out the mechanism that propelled them . His mind grasped the designer 's plan very quickly , and sometimes he had bettered it in devices of his own . Skill calling to skill . He took quiet pride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
