The 1964 edition of the rising Crescent , the yearbook of the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul , a hill station north of Islamabad , is filled with nicknames and in-jokes . Graduating cadet Pervez Musharraf , then 20 , is teased for his hearty appetite and preference for a center hair part . ( " Has the habit of splitting hairs . " ) But the slim leather-bound volume is more than a collection of collegiate memories ; it 's also a testimonial to the camaraderie whipped up during two arduous years of grunt training in the foothills of the Himalayas . Musharraf 's classmates concluded his entry : " A guy to be with , especially when in a fix . " <P> Pakistan is in a fix now . No one knows that better than Musharraf . He is a veteran of tight squeezes : no leader in Asia , perhaps in the world , has survived the number and magnitude of political crises that he has in the past few years . In 1999 , as army chief , he crossed the Line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he steered his country in a risky U-turn after Sept. 11 that led him to accept America 's invitation to break with Afghanistan 's Taliban , overhaul his internal security forces and act as host for the war on terror . And this past May he clashed with India in a showdown that risked nuclear escalation ; this time he curbed Pakistan 's Kashmir insurgency in exchange for peace . Each time Musharraf has gambled , and so far his luck has held . " I was always a risk taker , " he tells TIME from his perch in a gold-upholstered chair in the parlor of Army House , his Rawalpindi residence , surrounded by 18th century muskets and gilded sabers . <P> Musharraf knows that even more dangers lie ahead  --  for the U.S. , Pakistan and , of course , the President . Just last week the Pakistani government announced it had foiled an assassination plot against Musharraf in April in Karachi that included a defector from Pakistan 's paramilitary police force . Then , on Saturday , a group of armed men slaughtered 25 Hindus in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV . Indian police suspect a Pakistan-based Muslim militia . If so , the provocation would rank with the mass murder that sparked the May face-off . Now more than ever , the world is counting on Musharraf the risk taker  --  who assures us his risks are calculated  --  to steer South and Central Asia from internal chaos to regional security , from the threshold of nuclear Armageddon to Pax Pakistania , from fundamentalist fervor to secular moderation . <P> Musharraf is a natural charmer : hospitable and humorous , eager to share delicate samosas and sugary sweets from the kitchen of Army House , prepared to venture anywhere in a conversation  --  and compulsively eager to please . Do you want to meet his wife ? Brother ? Grandnephew ? He will invite them in for a chat . Much of his public support since he seized power in October 1999 has been based on that ingratiating sincerity . Musharraf 's speeches on television  --  the most memorable came last January , when he explained why he had to crack down on Islamic fundamentalism  --  tend to be emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populace has responded to the aura of a military man who seems neither haughty nor overly intellectual .
