NO LOVE MATCH <P> Even before the French Open kicked off this week , NATHALIE TAUZIAT was swinging at her fellow players . In her newly released memoir , Les Dessous du Tennis Feminin ( The Underside of Women 's Tennis ) , Tauziat , 32 , complains that the game 's fans and the Women 's Tennis Association are more impressed by good looks than raw talent . She is particularly dismayed at the popularity of pulchritudinous ANNA KOURNIKOVA , 18 , one of the top money earners on the tour last year despite the fact that she has never won a singles tournament . Tauziat brands Kournikova a self-absorbed " Lolita " who plays up her nonathletic charms to garner attention . She does concede that the Russian is " fun and rather nice , even if she unfortunately does not show respect to everyone . " Given the nature of her complaint , it is somewhat curious that Tauziat chose to pose for the cover of her book on a bed , clutching a pillow , wearing a nightgown . It seems she 's picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEOPLE BREAK UP <P> WHO : Actor HUGH GRANT and model ELIZABETH HURLEY <P> WHEN : Last week , after 13 years of dating <P> HOW : According to their publicist , " temporarily " and under a " mutual and amicable decision " <P> RELATIONSHIP HIGH POINT : The touching loyalty she displayed in 1995 when he was arrested for lewd behavior after being caught with Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown in the backseat of a car <P> RELATIONSHIP LOW POINT : Their collaboration  --  she produced , he starred  --  on the film Mickey Blue Eyes <P> MOST SHOCKING REVELATION : They will continue to live in the same London house <P> HOSIERY IS SURE TO FOLLOW <P> It makes some odd celebrity sense that Regis Philbin is lending his name to a line of ties : his monochromatic cravats have inspired legions of followers .

Last week while on tour in Europe , Oasis guitarist and songwriter NOEL GALLAGHER , right , got in yet another tiff with brother and co-founding member LIAM and flew home to England . This leaves Liam as the only original member of the band on the current tour . Unlike the last time a Gallagher brother deserted ( in 1996 when Liam walked out on dates in the U.S. ) , the group has n't been selling many albums and radio play has been scarce . Fraternal tension , however , has remained high , and in recent months the brothers have refused to be interviewed in the same room .
