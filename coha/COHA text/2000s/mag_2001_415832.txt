// Theodore de Bry after John White : The Town of Secota , from the volume America , Part 1 , 1590 , colored engraving , 11 1/4 by 8 5/8 inches . // From Eden to Levittown , the goal of shaping a perfect society has preoccupied theologians , philosophers , social radicals and commercial developers . A landmark exhibition at the New York Public Library traced this dream through the millennia with rare works from both sides of the Atlantic . Late in the fall of 1848 , that - momentous year when revolution swept through Europe , the caricaturist known as Bertall published a satire of utopian thought called The Carnival of Ideas in one of the many Parisian journals devoted to lampooning the politics and mores of the time . The famous representatives of contemporary utopian and socialist politics are pictured vigorously competing with one another , each promising a cure for society 's bitter woes . At the left he drew Etienne Cabet lauding his ideal land of Icaria-whose capital Bertall mischievously locates in Charenton , known to all as the home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victor Considerant , a disciple of the utopian theorist Charles Fourier , earnestly expounds on one of the latter 's notorious ideas , the future biological mutation of the human race . Behind Considerant a great standard depicts the " emancipation of woman " as a figure who stirs a cooking pot with her trunklike nose , which conveniently frees her hands to write ( a political screed no doubt ) . Not surprisingly , she smokes a pipe and wears pants and spurs . If Bertall 's opinion of these idealists was low , evidently their opinion of each other was not much higher : each speaker 's standard warns the audience that , while he is of sound mind , " the others are simpletons , " or " my neighbors are asses , " and so on . Bertall 's barbed , brilliant and still hilarious cartoon was just one modest item among more than 500 on display at the New York Public Library ( NYPL ) in the sprawling , encyclopedic exhibition " Utopia : The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe or on the omnibus and then discarded , The Carnival of Ideas nevertheless offers today 's viewer a rich ground for reflection . For despite its altogether disapproving , reactionary tone , it captures at least an echo of the moment 's excitement , of Paris in the midst of revolutionary ferment , when , as Alexis de Tocqueville noted , " a thousand strange systems poured from the impetuous imaginations of innovators and spread through the troubled minds of the crowd " : Photograph Bertall ( Albert d'Arnould ) : The Carnival of Ideas published in Journal pour rire , no. 37 , October 1838 , lithograph , 11 7/8 by 14 3/4 inches .

One was going to abolish inequality of fortunes ; another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequality of all , that between men and women . There were remedies against poverty , and against that disease called work which has afflicted man since the beginning of his existence.1 In their alarmed visions , social conservatives Bertall and Tocqueville alike described a Paris in upheaval , where tongues had been loosened and citizens claimed the public sphere as a space in which to say anything . It was precisely this utopian , democratic right to free debate which they found so threatening , so disorienting , for the noisy clash of ideas presupposed the absence of that stable center ( the king , the nation or God ) upon which they believed social order rested.2 Originally proposed by Paul LeClerc , president of the NYPL , some five years ago , " Utopia " was the result of an unprecedented collaboration between the library and the Bibliotheque Nationale de France ( BNF ) , where a version of the exhibition was on view earlier.3 Organized by Roland Schaer of the BNF , with an international team of curatorial advisers ( many of whom contributed to the accompanying catalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted at the NYPL . From its remarkable holdings , supplemented by loans from the BNF and other collections , an assemblage of books , manuscripts , drawings , prints , maps , photographs and objects of the most heterogeneous description chronicled the history of a Western obsession : the dream of an ideal society , " organized " - as an introductory wall text read- " in ways that guarantee the felicity of its members . " With a sweeping , panoramic vision , " Utopia " traced this history from its distant origins in classical antiquity and biblical story , through its efflorescence during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment , to its reversals in the disasters of the 20th century . The library 's spacious ground-floor Gottesman Exhibition Hall housed the first and largest segment of the show , which addressed utopian thinking from its sources to the end of the 19th century . The viewer found a beautiful array of medieval manuscripts that summarized the wellsprings of this dream of an ideal world in two enduring images of a lost , original happiness . On the one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a primordial state of humanity in which people neither aged nor suffered but lived in communion with their gods . On the other hand , the Bible proffered the myth of Paradise , of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden . One 15th-century Book of Hours depicts the expulsion from the Garden as precisely the loss of that original plenitude . A flaming red angel with upraised sword chases Adam and Eve from an idyllic landscape , charmingly rendered in great detail by the anonymous Franco-Flemish illuminator . Adam , hunched with shame and pulling his beard in anguish , looks despondently ahead to a life of toil , while Eve seems altogether more conflicted , gesturing onward with her right arm but turning her head back toward Paradise for one last , unforgettable look . What we might call the utopian impulse was not confined to that nostalgic look back . In a temporal inversion that redirected utopian thought , medieval society relocated the Golden Age from the dawn of history to its end . Paradise became a reward attained at the end of a life 's quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its goal ) or a legendary voyage , like that of the sixth-century Irish monk , Saint Brendan . The Church used the quest to stimulate fervor for the crusade to refound the celestial city , the New Jerusalem , while secular powers exploited it to forge trade routes to the East . But the end of history cuts both ways . As the curators demonstrated , the dream of a Golden Age to come could be mobilized from below , spurring dreams of universal equality . Such ideas flavored the millennarianism that periodically shook the medieval world from the 13th century onward . Egalitarian hope could be read in the German work known as the Bible History of Conradus Schlapperitzi ( 1445 ) , which was open to a page that represents the common lineage of all humankind . Adam labors in the field while Eve sits nearby spinning wool , an infant swaddled at her feet . At the upper left a caption reads , " When Adam delved and Eve span , /Who was then the gentleman/In whom from God such honor ran ? " A common medieval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are equal , but also carried an implicit charge against feudal landowners  --  a populist impeachment of privilege made yet more powerful by the naive drawing style , so far from the courtly niceties evident in the roughly contemporary Book of Hours .

BNF. // One of the exhibition 's great strengths was this interest in what we could call " subaltern utopias , " that is , ideal societies as imagined by socially marginal groups . The dominant classes never held a monopoly on longing for a different world . ' Around the corner from objects devoted to imagining a noble Golden Age stood a vitrine presenting corresponding voices from below . Christine de Pisan 's book Cite des Dames ( 1405 ) was open to the introductory page 's marvelous depiction of , on the left , Christine 's vision of three crowned women ( Reason , Rectitude and Justice ) who encouraged her to build and , on the right , a protective castle as refuge for virtuous women . The sight of Christine and the figure of Reason engaged in the labor of building-occupying the masculine space of architectural design and execution-is no less powerful for being allegorical . Nearby a sizable engraving mapped " La Cuccagna , " the land of milk and honey described in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor and inequity was turned upside down , for in Cockaigne , " chi piu dorme piu guadagna " ( " the more you sleep , the more you earn " ) . Life was effortless in a land where the sea was " good Greek wine , " where owls lay fur coats and where one merely had to sit at table for roast birds to fall from the sky into one 's mouth . This was the visualization of the perennial dream of the poor , the liberation from what Tocqueville designated " that disease called work . " Whether named Cockaigne or the Rock Candy Mountain , it occupies a critical place in the geography of subaltern utopias . Avoiding the familiar academic debate APM over whether the term " utopia " connotes a " good place " or a " no-place , " the curators wisely chose to underscore which places such ideas were spoken from . Utopias may have been imaginary ideals , but they were concretely tied to the real world . As an introductory wall text explained , the exhibition sought to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories of the people , cultures , and periods that gave birth to them . For each individual dream is really the refracted image of a specific moment in time , an imaginary construct in which specific problems of the concrete world are resolved and happiness  --  that most elusive of goals  --  is attained . Nowhere were these connections clearer than in Thomas More 's Utopia ( 1516 ) , the book that founded a new genre at the crossroads of literature , politics and philosophy , and constituted the crux of the exhibition . More 's text consists of a virulent critique of contemporary England ( as a longtime friend of Henry VIII and a high official at court , he knew well of what he wrote ) , followed by a description of the island of Utopia . The book would become something of a Renaissance best-seller ; within three months of its first publication , there were calls to reprint it . Between 1516 and 1689 , 24 Latin editions of the book appeared , and it was widely translated into vernacular languages throughout Europe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the fictive island on the left and a sample of its alphabet on the right-a clever juxtaposition that lent both exoticism and verity to the whole account . Features of the island are labeled : Amaurotum ( the " foggy city , " a likely allusion to London ) and the river Anydrus ( i.e. , without water ) , both of which suggest the ambivalent quality of the tale that follows , for More describes a country that is ideal and utterly unrealizable . The alphabet is accompanied by a Latin poem that reads : // Utopia 's perfection is symbolized by its status as an island , yet as the poem states , it does not lack for contact with the outside world . More specifies that Utopia is peopled by seafarers and merchants , and that it derives its essential resources from foreign trade . It is the power of gold , not the protection afforded by ocean or military , that protects the island ; hence the state is ran by successful traders rather than by a warrior class . Photograph Jules Arnoult : Bird's-Eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 23 1/4 . BNF. // More spoke for a rising English bourgeoisie already aware of its own importance and seeking to assume its share of political responsibilities . In this manner , he " brought the ideal society out of the realm of the hereafter , " a wall text informed us , and " into the realm of earthly possibility . " That possibility is indicated as well by More 's having sited the island in that " New World " which the West had only recently encountered , and whose emergence provided Europeans like More with a tabula rasa on which to project their fantasies . Lingering medieval dreams of discovering lost paradises coexisted in the Renaissance with the nascent impulse of exploration . The dawning scientific consciousness was figured in the exhibition by the Green Globe ( ca. 1506 ) - the first to label the newly encountered western landmass as " America " - and , even more strikingly , by the so-called Map of Christopher Columbus from the late 15th century , which unfortunately was only exhibited in Paris . The left side of the map offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine celestial spheres turn and a terrestrial geography indebted to biblical mythology . On the right of the same sheet , however , is a navigational map of the Atlantic and Mediterranean that carefully plots the long African coastline , only recently explored by Portuguese mariners . No more stark contrast of mentalities-one faith-based and tradition-bound , the other questioning and expansive-could be imagined . Like More 's Utopia , the Columbus map displayed not merely the New World but the stirrings of modernity itself . Modernity would give rise to its own dreams of the ideal , its own phantasms . On the Columbus map , we notice a large space in the northwest Atlantic that has been reserved for an imaginary island alternately called Frixlandia , Brazil or the Island of Seven Cities , and whose reputedly fantastic wealth was a constant lure to explorers . The Americas would continue to be defined by such projections , as seen in the series of beautiful colored engravings made at the end of the 16th century by Theodore de Bry , who spent the better part of his life illustrating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual catalogue of Europe 's vision of the New World 's inhabitants , who were seen in turn as noble savages or heathen brutes . De Bry 's engravings , based on the drawings of artists who joined the voyagers to America , range from an image of a gruesome cannibal feast , in which a child receives a hand on which to happily gnaw while the adults enoy more delectable parts , to one of a harmonious indigenous village in Virginia , which by contrast seems reassuringly vegetarian . One index of the nascent modernity of these later utopian imaginings is their ambivalent approach to the question of religion . From More 's book forward , the point of utopia became the institution of a paradise on earth , accomplished precisely without the aid of divine grace . This aspect of utopian thought would reach an apogee during the Enlightenment , when natural science became a substitute for religion . In The Year 2440 ( 1771 ) , Louis-Sebastian Mercier 's dream of an ideal future , people have renounced theology to practice the monotheistic worship " of the patriarchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow the faithful contact with the " great lessons of Nature . " // Thomas Jefferson 's manuscript the Declaration of Independence , 1776 , with underlining of passages edited by the Second Continental Congress ; one of four pages , ink on paper , 11 by 8 5/8 inches . // We are not far from the impulses that inspired the visionary designs of 18th-century architects such as Etienne-Louis Boullee , whose remarkable watercolor renderings of his proposed Cenotaph of Newton ( ca. 1785 ) were among the centerpieces of the exhibition . This sublime sphere , set amid the ordered nature of a landscaped garden , combined the functions of memorial and planetarium , conjoining the transience of humanity with the eternal celestial realm . This is more than a monument to Newton 's genius ; rather , it honors the Promethean scientist who unlocks the mysteries of the cosmos , thereby elevating all humankind to the level of the gods . Those grandiose Enlightenment dreams would become the stakes of historical struggle in the democratic revolutions of the late 18th century . The room devoted to that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pivoted , for here the earlier promises were meant to be both fulfilled and transformed into something qualitatively different : the concept of utopia would at long last become the very principle of the reformulation of social reality . The changed tone is already evident in a popular French engraving of 1789 that depicts a wizened peasant forced to carry a corpulent priest and aristocrat on his back , an allusion to the taxes whose burden was borne unfairly by ordinary people . Its caption reads : " Messrs . Clergymen and Nobles not only paid nothing but also were granted graces , pensions that drained the state , and the unhappy farmer could barely provide for his own subsistence . " Along with its portentous date , the print bears the title " We must hope that this game will be over very soon . " During the previous decade , Britain 's American colonies had ended the Crown 's game , affirming that " all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their creator with ... inalienable rights ; that among these are life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases , appearing in the exhibition 's manuscript copy of the Declaration of Independence in Thomas Jefferson 's own hand , took on a new life when seen as the realization of a long line of political fictions composed since the Renaissance . However , even within the realm of utopian thought , Jefferson 's document was radical , for he dispelled the dream of a single , static ideal imposed once and for all . No abstract system would exist above the community of citizens , uniting them around its center . Instead , the community would come into being only in its continual struggle to define itself , to invent and reinvent those principles and organizational forms that might guarantee the maximum of " safety &; happiness " for all . Another radical view of a utopia far , far from More 's was offered by an anonymous watercolor recording a provincial " Festival of the Supreme Being " ( shown only in Paris ) . Celebrated on June 8 , 1794 , when Robespierre and the Terror still held sway , the festival was one of several attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach former subjects to be citizens . In the great cities , these festivals had a primarily coercive aspect-the forerunners of all those contrived " spontaneous demonstrations of the people 's will " we grew used to during the last century  --  but this small drawing suggests what they might have been . The atmosphere is somewhere between that of a parade and a harvest festival , and the whole is suffused with a gentle spirit of goodwill , as the people gather to lay the foundations of a new social order and to celebrate their provisional community . The radical promises of the 18th-century revolutions would quickly be dispelled . A long passage condemning slavery in Jefferson 's declaration was suppressed in the Congress 's revisions ( " mutilations , " the author called them ) , and in France the Revolution soon degenerated into the Terror , Empire and , finally , Restoration . Utopian thought in the first half of the 19th century absorbed these setbacks , retreating from a vision of a democratic debate and struggle to the certainties offered by closed systems . The room devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filled with such systems , illustrated and explicated in a veritable explosion of books , broadsides , posters , charts and manifestos . Here were the visions of charismatic private individuals , from the model factories of Robert Owen to the fraternal dream of Henri de Saint-Simon . The latter endorsed a creed of mutual aid , symbolized in the very clothing worn by his followers : " Utopia " featured a waistcoat ( emblazoned with the word " Father " ) worn in the 1830s by Pere Enfantin , leader of the Saint-Simonian society , which , like those worn by all members , buttoned from behind , so that adepts could not even dress without help . At the most delirious extreme of these utopian projects , we find Fourier and his principal adherent , Consid6rant . For them , architecture , not symbolic clothing , was central to planning the ideal community , which they called the " phalanstery " ( an amalgam of " phalanx " and " monastery " ) . An engineer , Considerant dedicated himself to elaborating the plans of these " social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palaces of the ancien regime , would be devoted to " all men " rather than just " a few . " Ideally the phalanstery would gather a population of 1,620 men and women , each carefully selected to represent one of the 810 passions vertiginously catalogued by Fourier , thus providing for harmonious combinations in all aspects of life . Fourier intended his communities to spread over the surface of the globe . The architecture was to mirror the perfectly calibrated social order : self-sufficient yet open to the outside , it provided spaces for living , work and leisure that were contiguous , even intermingled.6 The Paris version of " Utopia " featured a beautiful lithograph of a Bird's-Eye View of a Phalanst ( 1847 ) , which depicts a decidedly Versailleslike structure set amid gardens formal and informal stretching to the horizon . With no capitalist daring enough to invest in the scheme , the phalanstery never saw the light of day . The pseudo-phalanstery built as a model factory in 1859 at Guise by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Andre Godin was , as the photographs and other documentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection of Fourier 's and Considerant 's ideas . It was this very need " to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeoisie " that led Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels to dismiss the dreams of Cabet , Fourier and Saint-Simon as " castles in the air . " Despite their schemes for the abolition of private property , the reconciliation of town and country , and the provision of social harmony ( and Marx in particular owed much to Fourier 's thought , though he never admitted it ) , the utopians ' refusal to embrace the class struggle mired them in " systematic pedantry .

Woodcuts by Edmund Hort New pictured the workshops at Merton Abbey , a realization of Morris 's dream of preindustrial handicraft production . Examples from the Kelmscott Press evidenced Morris 's contributions to utopian literature as well as his revival of medievalizing ornament . Compared to Morris , other movements were positively slighted . Anarchism was reduced to a cipher : a lithograph after Paul Signac 's mural-scaled painting In the Time of Harmony ( 1895-1896 ) - originally titled In the time of Anarchy-which still hangs in the town hall of the " red " Parisian suburb of Montreuil . n the library 's third-floor exhibition hall , the curators took up the traces of these struggles for radical social change which were deposited in the Soviet experiment when the Bolsheviks announced their realization of the Marxist " dictatorship of the proletariat . " The importance of this episode should not be underestimated , for it comprised the noteworthy occasion when politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale of an entire country ( and then some ) . The curators focused on what they termed " The Making of a New Man , " " or the shaping of the ideal participant in the construction of the communist state . Yet the participation was of a particular sort : in a clip from Sergei Eisenstein 's classic film The General Line ( 1928 ) , men drive tractors in a choreographed procession worthy of Busby Berkeley . Propaganda posters such as the monumental Women ; Go to the Cooperatives ! ( ca. 1918 ) , with its statuesque mother and child against a backdrop of factories , exhort women to embrace their role in collective labor . Participation has little to do with the assertion of an individual citizen 's rights . The point was even clearer in Paris , where loans from the Stedelijk Museum allowed the BNF to display a fascinating series of modernist posters ( 193031 ) , designed by Gustav Klutsis , which made use of photographic montage to convey messages of national unity and individual submission to the leaders of the revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed juxtaposition in New York . One wall displayed a copy of U.S.S.R. in Construction ( a monthly available in different language editions , intended for foreign consumption ) , which featured a story on the construction of the White Sea Canal . The canal was built by forced labor at great cost to human life , a fact not disclosed in the photographs by the well-known Constructivist Aleksandr Rodchenko that illustrate the article . The glorification of the totalitarian system encoded in Rodchenko 's dynamic photography was undermined by the nearby placement of a series of pictures , taken in the winter of 1936-37 , of labor camp prisoners at work in the bleak surroundings of the northern Russian woods . Made by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs to document one of their gulags , these homely snapshots of men struggling in a barren landscape , without heroism or hope , provided the necessary counterpoint to Rodchenko 's propaganda images nearby . The story told in the " Utopia " exhibition did not end on this somber , if essential , point . The show concluded with a somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a perfect , harmonious community seemed to go no farther than the suburbs . Advertisements and brochures for the first great postwar suburban development , Levittown , and its 1990s reincarnation , Disney 's Celebration , show the establishment of commercial- and real-estate-driven " utopias , " which cynically adopt fragments of the language of earlier reformers . Photograph Healing Waters One of the more noteworthy revelations of the New York Public Library 's " Utopia " exhibition was the fruitful link , in the modem era , between utopian aspiration and concrete action in the real world . A close-to-home example is provided by " Healing Waters : Utopian Responses to Dirt , Disease &; Disorder , 1890-1940 , " a small exhibition organized jointly by the New York City Municipal Archives and the South Street Seaport Museum and displayed in the latter 's Lower Manhattan space concurrently with the NYPL show . " Healing Waters " offers a concise overview of waters role as " an important tool for shaping a new urban order " during the eras of Progressive and , later , New Deal reform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by archival materials ( ranging from stock certificates , whose sale funded construction of the city 's water supply system , to a vintage model of a horse-drawn fire carriage ) , the show traces the history of a set of largely invisible infrastructures and taken-forgranted public services that have shaped the city down to the present . Late 19th-century New York was in the grip of what one wall text euphemistically describes as a " sanitation crisis . " Although municipal authorities had already made a commitment to providing city residents with a fresh , clean water supply ( a history traced in an introductory section to the exhibition ) , the water tended to reach only the privileged classes . Ethnic minorities , immigrants and the working classes were all crowded into slums that were served only poorly , if at all . In the city 's tenements ( where , in 1900 , more than two-thirds of the population of 3.36 million lived ) , indoor plumbing was nonexistent and outdoor privies still the norm . To these unsanitary conditions must be added the lack of high-pressure pipelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the crisis faced by Progressive reformers of the 1890s , and particularly by mayor William Strong , who initiated a series of public health improvements directed largely at this unserved population . Under the heading " Clean Bodies/Clean Streets , " the exhibition presents Strong 's reforms and their successors as having the dual goal of controlling disease through better provision of basic services and controlling a population inclined toward political radicalism by means of a sustained inculcation with middle-class values , cleanliness foremost among them . We see the 1900 floor plan of a tenement where , in accordance with a new law , indoor plumbing had replaced outhouses , each family now having its own " water toilet " clearly marked in the design . Equally impressive was the effort to provide neighborhood public baths ; between 1901 and 1909 , 20 were constructed throughout the city , the largest concentration in the immigrant slums of the Lower East Side . " Healing Waters " features the elevation and plan of one such bathhouse , drawn ca. 1904 for 133 Allen Street . This was no modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Sawyer Architects , it was a lavishly appointed classical structure with a facade of granite , limestone and copper sheathing . As with the tenement plan , functional hygienic concerns were inseparable from ideological ones : indoor plumbing made life easier as it also reinforced the social model of the bourgeois nuclear family ; the public baths strictly segregated the sexes with separate entrances and provided individual shower stalls , all in the name of battling promiscuity . These reforms were accompanied by hygiene education programs that made use of newspapers , schools and city agencies . A set of archival photographs from ca. 1910 shows the Children 's Health Center at City Hospital , Randall 's Island , where , under the tutelage of Health Department instructors , children learned lessons such as the one visible on a poster : Take a lot of water , step into a tub . / Take a bar of soap and then , a thorough scrub . " Other photos document the public implementation of a street-cleaning program ( which had been the responsibility of individual property owners until 1895 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the New Deal-era inheritors of the Progressive mantle expanded the provision of services to include recreational opportunities for the city 's working population . We may remember Robert Moses today as the autocrat who sought to drive freeways through defenseless neighborhoods , dispersing their populations to the winds , but in the 1930s , as parks commissioner , he worked doggedly to obtain a $10-million grant from the WPA program to build public swimming pools and beaches for those unable to escape to the countryside during the summer months . " Healing Waters " features architects " renderings of six of the 10 pools constructed . In their populist , streamlined styles , they offer a telling contrast to York &; Sawyer 's Beaux-Arts bathhouse . The latter is the very image of civic authority , a declarative imposition of governmental order upon the untutored immigrant masses ; Moses 's pools , by contrast , offer a friendly , technocratic modernism , a reassuring image of a government , if not precisely of the people , at least for the people . The legacy of reformers such as Strong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display ( from a 1938 map of the New York City water supply system , stretching well up into the Catskill Mountains and the Delaware River watershed , to a 1907 map of the high-pressure system beneath the streets of downtown Brooklyn ) clearly evidence the sheer physical scale of these undertakings and the political and social will required to see them built . Yet like the most compelling sections of " Utopia , " " Healing Waters takes pains to demonstrate the two faces of such reformism : the ability to bring real relief to underprivileged populations , always accompanied by the desire , through those very means , to extend a network of control ever more thoroughly through the social body .

The atmosphere was evoked by a wild mix of political posters , buttons ( my favorite : " LSD not LBJ " ) and publications from the underground press , along with audio and video clips of key speeches , concerts and songs of those years . The contrast between the ordered , isolated cells of the suburban landscape and the frenetic scenes of street protest recalled those two antagonistic models of the ideal society : utopia as a perfect , closed system and utopia as an experimental community . So rich in provocative and beautiful objects was the NYPL 's " Utopia , " that it seems almost impertinent to ask just what we were seeing represented in that treasury . Nevertheless it is a question which should be asked when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' paradise , we were confronted with hundreds of images promising to show us just what the ideal society will look like . What might it truly mean to represent " utopia , " to picture the ideal ? It is a challenge perhaps best articulated by the Frankfurt School philosopher Theodor Adorno , when he said , " If I may put it crassly : one may not cast a picture of utopia in a positive manner . " 8 Adorno was trying to suggest the complex , contradictory role that representation plays in the utopian project : though the ideal society is nothing less than " the determined negation of that which is , " one can not picture it without recalling the familiar elements of the world to be transformed . Every representation of utopia is , in other words , simultaneously its undermining . This presents the artist with a well-nigh impossible task . We only know the truth of utopia , the strength of its negativity , to the extent that it is not represented . Essentially , any concrete image of utopia falsifies the utopian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us , " Insofar as we are not allowed to cast the picture of utopia , insofar as we do not know what the correct thing would be , we know exactly , to be sure , what the false thing is. " 9 He returns to the crucial insight that the ideal lies not in a settled plan for the future , not in an end to history , but in our continual effort to redefine society according to an impossible but necessary goal . Perhaps it is just this fact that made Bertall 's sardonic , modest caricature stand out in the galleries crowded with relics of past social dreams ; perhaps it was the echo of what was not pictured that made " Utopia " such a fascinating and thought-provoking exhibition . " Utopia : The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World " was on view at the New York Public Library Oct 14 , 2000-Jan. 27 , 2001 . A different version of the exhibition was presented in Paris at the Bibliotheque Nationale de France Apr. 4-July 9 , 2000 . Footnote 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence , eds . J.P . Mayer and A.P .

Winston Moore and Paul Cammack , London , Verso , 1985. 3 . The Paris and New York versions of " Utopia " shared a conceptual framework and thematic organization but often differed in the objects included . Each venue featured a preponderance of exemplars from its home collection , supplemented by notable loans from the partner institution ; thus , the NYPL loaned its manuscript copy of the Declaration of Independence to Paris , while the BNF reciprocated by loaning New York its visionary architectural renderings by Etienne-Louis Boulle. 4 .

OHIO OFFERS THE ULTIMATE GETAWAY THAT PAMPERS AND CHALLENGES GUESTS , THEN SENDS THEM HOME WITH A SENSE OF RENEWAL . <p> New York Chef Anthony Schulz had never heard of Hocking Hills , Ohio , when he applied for a position at The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state 's remote and picturesque southern third . Trained at the French Culinary Institute and working on Long Island , he was ready for a change , although he admits , " My knowledge of Ohio was limited to Cleveland , Columbus , and Cincinnati . " <p> The echoing chamber of Ash Cave holds Pulpit Rock , which was once used as a preaching pulpit for ministers of area churches holding outdoor services there . <p> A phone interview led to an invitation to travel west for the ultimate test -- to create a four-course meal for the innkeepers , using whatever he found in the kitchen 's larder . Not only did he pass the test , but he also caught the vision . " We want to take the inn to the next level , and one way to do that is by offering a heart-healthy menu , " explains Ellen Grinsfelder , who operates the facility with her husband . Two years later Chef Anthony , now a confirmed Buckeye , oversees the kitchen staff , teaches occasional cooking classes , and scours the local markets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away as Chicago and Detroit . <p> Grinsfelder 's plan is to preserve the delicate balance between the inn 's rustic setting and its first-class service . The dining room is housed in an 1840s log cabin , but the art on the walls is original , the food on the tables is elegant , and the wines on the list are diverse . Guests can watch Chef Anthony prepare their North Atlantic flounder stuffed with ricotta and sweet basil knowing that the basil came from the herb garden located atop the inn 's roof , safely out of reach of the deer that wander the grounds . <p> Towering cliffs , waterfalls , and deep hemlock-shaded gorges lure hikers and naturalists to trails that range from a quick quarter-mile jaunt to a challenging three-mile trek . After a turn on the trails , guests can unwind at relaxing resort accommodations such as The Inn &; Spa at Cedar Falls with its resplendent herb gardens . <p> Hocking Hills -- all 11,000 square acres of it -- is a sprawling community of cottage industries in the truest sense of the term . Some 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of tourists who visit each year . Although summer and fall are considered high season for guests , " winter and early spring are my favorite times , " says Grinsfelder , whose mother opened the inn in 1987 to provide a place where city dwellers could retreat to a natural setting . Less than an hour 's drive southeast of Columbus , the region is a doable destination for urbanites in need of rejuvenation . <p> " Baby boomers are our largest single group of visitors , " says Karen Raymore , a recent transplant from northern Wisconsin and now the executive director of the local tourism association . " People that age -- and I 'm one of them -- like to prove that they can still hike , climb , and zipline . " <p> Zipline ? The latest craze to hit the area has adventure-seekers locked in harnesses and zipping along a network of cables at speeds up to 50 mph . The thrill begins with a 1.5-mile drive via golf cart through the woods to where a giant oak awaits . Guests climb up to a launch pad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they soar from one platform to another , some located as high as 70 feet above ground . The views are incredible ( if you dare look down ) and include the Hocking River , a waterfall , and dramatic rock and cliff formations . <p> Chef Anthony and his staff work in an open kitchen so diners at The Inn &; Spa at Cedar Falls can order their meals and then watch the preparation . <p> The same rough terrain that draws zipliners also lures hikers who prefer to enjoy the scenery with their boots planted firmly on the ground . Nearby Hocking Hills State Park is massive , as is the state forest that surrounds it . A series of caves is easily accessible through trails and bridges that were built as public works projects during the Great Depression . The steps are still sturdy and the passages from cave to . cave are large and airy , causing one daustrophobic hiker to remark with relief , " It 's not like slipping through a birth canal . " <p> To generate tourism after the spectacular fall foliage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inns and cabins during the slow months . A six-mile winter trek draws 3,000 and has been a January tradition since 1965 ; a " sweethearts hike " commemorates Valentine 's Day ; and March guests learn the process of turning maple sap into syrup before sitting down for a hardy pancake breakfast . Innkeepers collaborate with local venues to put together " packages " that offer a variety of places to stay , things to do , and restaurants to sample . <p> Working independently , the scores of inns carve out niches that set each one apart from its competition . For example , the Bear 's Den Cottages is a " nature and wellness retreat " that focuses on fitness and health . The Inn &; Spa at Cedar Falls has a full-service spa that offers mother-daughter getaways and a " desperate housewives package . " The Hocking Hills Resort enjoys a reputation as a one-stop wedding destination with an outdoor chapel and an in-house minister . <p> " We 're not on Main Street , so we knew we had to be versatile , " explains innkeeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to officiate at wedding services . Working together , the Stricklands host about 100 weddings each year . Among the most memorable was the formal event they arranged for a New York City couple who were so precise in their plans that they sent recipes for the foods they wanted served at the reception . The pressure was on , but the inn passed the test , recalls Melody . " If we can do that , we can do anything . " <p> Not for the fainthearted , a zipline tour takes thrill-seekers for a three-hour adventure along a network of cables . Professional guides offer a safety primer before you take flight . <p> By Holly G. Miller <p>
