alef the idiot <br> Everybody knew that Alef was a fool . By trade he was a ? sher &shy; man , but folks had seen a lowly carp outsmart him . Even the ? sh that Alef landed seldom made it past his fellow sailors , who took turns at snookering him , to decide who among them was smartest . One might lead him to believe that the rock cod in his bucket would dry to stone , and generously offer to trade it for a worm with which to try his luck again . Another might persuade him that his ? ounder was no odd ? sh , but rather the castaway face of a diver gone too long underwater , and gra &shy; ciously volunteer to return it to its rightful owner . To all these propositions , Alef eagerly agreed , blessed to have friends who accepted his dim wit , and looked after him . <br> Alef 's wife , on the other hand , was less forgiving of his shortcomings . Chaya was the daughter of a rabbi celebrated as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while she had her mother 's dark hair and stormy eyes , she 'd inherited her father 's luminous mind . <br> Since no one else in the rabbi 's village had been bright enough to comprehend him , least of all his wife and sons , the rabbi had taken little Chaya into his library and taught her the sacred tongue , to have someone with whom to study all that was holy . She 'd mastered Hebrew with alacrity , and had learned to argue ? ne points of doctrine by the time she was ten . A year later , she 'd trounced her father in a dispute over laws governing seminal discharge when the Sabbath sundown was occluded by a solar eclipse , from which she 'd deduced that she was wiser than anyone , and , therefore , no longer had to obey her mother . <br> That had resulted in arguments of an altogether different order , fought in shrieks and ? ts and , more than once , with a hurled pot of boiling water . Scarcely his daughter 's height , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studiously avoided these disputes , and even Chaya 's brothers , muscular thugs sev &shy; eral years older than she , had learned to slip out the door whenever the stormy eyes of mother and child met . <br> Many times while his wife was away at market , the rabbi had tried to persuade Chaya to show compassion for her , or at least to respect her , as required by law . But Chaya had con &shy; tested his interpretations , and even the ancient commentaries on which he based them , with such furious logic that the rabbi had been forced each time to concede defeat . Finally he 'd gone to his wife , the rebbetzin , to explain how Chaya was different from other girls , and why obedience should n't be expected of her . His wife had n't needed any fancy wordplay to reply . She 'd simply accused the rabbi of loving his daughter in lieu of her . <br> This , too , he 'd been unable to deny : Chaya 's body was as lithe as a serpent 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , been established . He 'd nodded and dumbly looked on while his wife had sent for the matchmaker , to get rid of the little nuisance . <br> In that village , the marriage broker was famous for cou &shy; pling children the day they were born . Her trick was to know folks ' fortunes , and to reckon love economically , according to the supply and demand of dowry . But the rabbi had forbidden her from prematurely pairing his little Chaya : He could n't tol &shy; erate predestination from an omniscient god , let alone a know-it- all yenta . So the old woman , sturdy like a pruned tree , had come to the rebbetzin without a suitable man . <br>  --  There must be someone . <br>  --  The locals are all taken . <br>  --  Chaya is the daughter of a rabbi . <br>  --  She comes with no dowry . <br>  --  My husband is not a rich man . But our Chaya is a pretty girl , after all . <br>  --  A pretty shrew , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why she has to go . <br>  --  I do , I do . Perhaps I can help you . There 's a man I 've heard of who lives by the sea , and for some years has sought a bride . <br>  --  Is he crippled ? Is he cruel ? <br>  --  Rebbetzin , folks say that he 's a fool . <br> The rebbetzin had laughed at that . She 'd squeezed the matchmaker 's hand . She might even have kissed the old maid , had the rabbi not walked in , roused by the unfamiliar sound of mirth in his house . The rebbetzin had stood , then . She 'd told her husband that a suitable groom had been found . <br>  --  He lives in this town ? <br>  --  There is n't a man in this village who deserves her . <br>  --  Then he is a great scholar ? <br>  --  What man could be as wise as Chaya ? <br> Naturally , the rabbi had n't had a response . And , because he was too frail to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway while his wife had put their daughter in a carriage with a loaf of bread and a note bearing the name of her be &shy; trothed . He 'd waved farewell , but the girl , wrapped tight in a black shawl , had n't even looked at him . Only out on the open road had she allowed herself , inaudible amid the horses ' clamor , to loosen the cloth and pour out her tears . <br> . . . <br> Alef 's fellow ? shermen seldom saw his wife after their wedding . Chaya refused to mingle with the common folk , lest they mock her , cultured rabbi 's daughter , for being married to the village idiot . But , as much as she dreaded their jeers , what upset her more was to hear them tease her husband : Certainly Alef was a fool , as she told him whenever he was dumb enough to utter a word in her presence , yet cuts in ? icted by others , which he was too dull to feel , pained her as if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was just one more symptom of her humiliation , were it not accompanied by another emotion  --  the insatiable urge to be held by him . <br> Alef was a large man , framed like a boat , into which slender Chaya ? t as if he 'd been hewn for her . Not that she believed those old romances that for every girl in the world a special boy was born : She could refute such notions historically , philosoph &shy; ically , and mathematically , to name but a few possibilities . Yet none of her arguments could hold up , even for a moment , to the force of a kiss . Every night came to the same conclusion . And every morning , lying in bed long after her husband had gone ? shing , she 'd wonder what , for all her reason , had happened . <br> By evening , she 'd be seething , blaming Alef for taking away her sapience and saddling her with love . She never spoke to her husband in such terms , which would have been wasted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their home and con &shy; fessed what had become of their evening meal , she 'd drag him inside and squeal : Are you a fool ? If he tried to respond , to justify his ? shlessness , she 'd recite her favorite proverb in the ancient tongue : The ignorant can not be righteous . Since he could n't reckon what she was saying , he 'd accept all blame and listen to her sputter and curse until , exhausted by her own fuming , she 'd come to be embraced by him . Then he 'd take her to bed , where their differences were what brought them together again . <br> Chaya 's behavior bewildered Alef . Why did her feelings for him turn with the hours of the day , while he adored her with the constancy of years ? What could he do not to lose her each afternoon ? What was wrong with him ? <br> He pondered these questions at sea and on land . He asked the opinion of the carp he caught , but , knowing no affection outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shermen , on the other hand , were eager to assist him , if only he 'd request their advice . Every day they asked about his wife . They in &shy; quired about her scholarship . Was she still intent to unseat the village rebbe , as she 'd threatened to do following a doctrinal dispute on Alef 's wedding day ? Did she plan to take the old maggid 's place ? Or did she want to put Alef on the pulpit ? At the height of his confusion , the ? shermen would act as if he al &shy; ready were the village pontiff and ask him to deliver a sermon , and , when he stuttered that he did n't know what to say , they 'd applaud him for his wisdom . <br> Then one day a storm grounded every sailor except for Alef . ( The weather did n't bother him , as he never thought to fear it ; sweeping the world of hubris , the torrents always took care to let his small vessel pass . ) When he harbored in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yudel , one of the shrewdest ? shers , was there , repairing his mast . He called Alef over . <br>  --  What are you doing on the water in this weather ? <br>  --  I 'm trying to catch some ? sh . <br>  --  Swells like these could swallow your boat , Alef . You 're a married man . What would your wife do without you ? <br>  --  I 'm sure she 'd get along . <br>  --  She must love you , though . <br>  --  I do n't know . <br>  --  What 's the matter ? You ca n't satisfy her ? <br>  --  I guess not . <br>  --  For some men , it 's like that . I can tell that you 're miserable . I know that you 've been meaning to con ? de in me for a while . So I 'll let you in on a secret . There is a cure for your ail &shy; ment . Would you do anything for Chaya , no matter what ? <br> When Alef shyly nodded , Yudel told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He insisted that Alef not see his wife ? rst , and made him swear never to tell her where he 'd been : If he did , he might not see her again . Yudel accompanied Alef to the forest ? oor . Then he scurried to the tavern to tell the other ? shermen about the fool 's errand . <br> Alef hiked long hours through woods midnight deep and darker than the day before creation . Wolves surrounded him , spiraling like planets through the heavens . He welcomed their stoic company , for walking through forest at night is lonely . He told them of all the ? sh he knew , and praised his sagacious wife . But when he told them what he was about to do on her behalf , their eyes widened and , in a blink , they scattered . <br> Alone again , he came to a clearing . In the moon 's ancient light , he saw the silhouette of a small windowless shack , seem &shy; ingly built in the cast of its own shadow . He climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pounded the door three times with his ? st . <br> The old dybbuk who answered ? t Yudel 's description , as much as any description could ? t such a demon . His skin seemed to be molded of the same dark substance as his home . He wore no clothes , yet only his face and hands appeared naked ; on the rest of his carcass , the wrinkles of black hide hung as heavy as an overcoat . <br> The dybbuk invited Alef inside . A faint glow illuminated the hovel , light seeping from a barrel such as those in which herring is pickled . The demon stood back while Alef ap &shy; proached the vat , having never known ? sh to be radiant . <br> He stared at them for a long while . They had no eyes , nor had they scales . They were slippery and pale , protoplasmic lumps no larger than Alef 's hand , sunken under a thick , clear syrup. <br>  --  Where do they come from ? <br>  --  They 're human . <br>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because you 've seen only the parts folks show . These are people 's souls . <br>  --  Those are souls ? <br>  --  The most in captivity anywhere in the world . Now tell me : What can I offer for yours , Alef ? What brings you here ? <br>  --  Yudel the ? sherman tells me that you can help me satisfy my wife . <br>  --  You 're ? accid ? <br>  --  People say that I 'm stupid . I do n't know . Every day , my Chaya asks me if I 'm a fool . I just want to give her an answer . <br>  --  You think an answer would satisfy her ? <br>  --  She 's a great scholar . If she has to wonder , it must be the deepest mystery . <br>  --  Yes , I see . You drive a hard bargain , but I 'll do it . You 'll give your soul to know if you 're a fool . <br> The dybbuk asked Alef to take off his cloak . Then he sat the ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . With a tin cup , he drew some syrup from the pickling barrel and washed it over his arms . He took another draft . Pinching Alef 's nose , the dybbuk poured it down his throat . As Alef choked , the demon thrust a black hand down his gullet , gripping the spasm at the nub , withdrawing a pallid gland . He held it , still heaving , in front of Alef , and then dropped it in the vat . <br> The room glowed much brighter than before . Alef could see that the demon 's living conditions were awfully poor . He 'd nei &shy; ther hearth nor bed . That dybbuks naturally have want of nei &shy; ther food nor sleep only added , in Alef 's estimation , to the demon 's destitution . As he took his leave , he did n't wonder , as previous victims of the dybbuk invariably had , whether giving up his soul was a foolish thing to do . After all , he 'd a brick oven and straw mattress , and even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unblessed creature needed his soul more than he did . <br> Chaya waited up for Alef , restless . Ever since their wed &shy; ding , she had n't passed a night alone , and , because she 'd never had occasion to miss him , she did n't appreciate that the aching she felt in every organ was but a symptom of separation , an in &shy; ? ammation of love . Nor did it comfort her to visit the tavern at midnight , asking if anyone had seen her husband , and to be met with derision . Probably mistook you for a bearded clam and drowned , the sailors jeered . Then Yudel followed her home , tried to fondle her , and offered to dive for her oyster . She hurled an iron pot at him , hitting him in the groin . He staggered back to the tavern , to drink away the pain . And what did she do ? She attempted to pray . <br> The liturgical training that Chaya had received from her father told her what words to say , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to worship in theory , the truth is that she 'd never before done it in practice . Prayer was for peasants , witless folk who 'd good reason to be subservient . Chaya had been dependent on no one before Alef . Only the agony of his absence brought her to her knees , on the cabin 's hard dirt ? oor . From down there , she whispered some sacred words , found they had no substance in her mouth . She uttered others , still holier . She could not feel them on her breath . She sputtered secret incantations , heavenly formulations that mor &shy; tals were never meant to possess . She could n't even hear her own voice . She started to cry . Her throat opened . Her chest ? lled . Her sobbing sounded like great bells pealing , ringing in a new dawn . <br> She did not hear her husband return . He softly shut the door . He came close , knelt in front of her . He touched a ? nger to her cheek , caught a falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wondered if she did n't recognize him , if he looked different , soulless . Had he blackened like the dybbuk ? Would Chaya be upset by that ? Then he heard his name . She was cursing him , her persecutor , for making her adore him , only to abandon her . <br> He could not say that he 'd been away for her sake without divulging where he 'd gone , and since she did not ask the ques &shy; tion for which he 'd so dutifully sought an answer , all that he could do , as she battered him with accusations , was to look on in dumb innocence . That only made her angrier . She invoked every curse of antiquity . The ignorant can not be righteous , she screeched . <br> Silence is the fence around wisdom , the fool at last replied . He said it almost in a whisper , but what stunned Chaya was that he 'd spoken it , ? awlessly , in the ancient tongue . <br>  --  Where did you learn that , Alef ? <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line from Talmud . <br>  --  The words just came to me. <br>  --  You do n't even know Hebrew . <br>  --  I 'm not learned . <br>  --  Yet you 're speaking to me in Hebrew now . <br> Alef recognized that she was right . He also noticed that she 'd become quiet . When he embraced her , she held him even tighter than on their wedding night , peering into his eyes with even greater wonder than when they 'd ? rst come together . <br> The following morning , Alef found that he knew more than Talmud . Out at the seashore , sailors pestered him with trick questions of an arithmetical nature to make him blush and stammer  --  if you lose four of the three ? sh you catch , how many are left ?  --  but he calmly responded by giving them a les &shy; son in negative digits . Then he unmoored his boat , and , while the others puzzled over the proofs he 'd written in the sand , sailed into open waters . <br> He dropped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see where it had snagged  --  and hauled a ? uke into the boat . No sooner had he cast again than he hooked another one . He pulled in ? ve of them , then ten . His hull was just about full when he remembered that his wife did n't like ? uke , which she considered common : At their wedding , Chaya had declared that she ate only salmon . So he dropped his line , and hooked her one . <br> It was still early when Alef sailed back into harbor . The other ? shermen were where he 'd left them , quibbling . Some argued that the old dybbuk was playing with them , using soul &shy; less Alef as his puppet . Others maintained that , by forsaking his soul , Alef himself became a demon . They agreed only that Chaya must not know what had happened , must not discover where they 'd let Yudel send her husband , for her pot- hurling fury raged ? ercer than damnation . <br> Then Alef was upon them . He smiled . Nervously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? sh . He gave away all that he had except for the salmon , which he proudly carried home to his wife . <br> He handed it to her when she opened the door . The ? sh was as large as her torso . She did not ask if Alef was a fool . She looked at the salmon , dripping cold water down her chest , and then at her husband , blond head beati ? c , crowned in sweat . <br>  --  Where did you get this ? sh ? <br>  --  I caught it . It 's the kind you like , Chaya. <br>  --  I know that . But most days you ca n't even land an an &shy; chovy. <br>  --  In the Talmud it says . . . <br>  --  Do n't quote that book to me. <br>  --  Then mathematically speaking ... <br>  --  What the hell is happening ? <br>  --  I just know where ? sh are in the ocean . <br>  --  Every one ? <br>  --  Even the clams. <br>  --  Those are n't ? sh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oysters have pearls . <br>  --  Those ca n't be eaten either . But it would n't be criminal to give me a few jewels . <br> Alef pulled a couple of oysters out of his pocket and opened them with his thumbs . From each , he plucked a little oval pearl . Later , after they 'd gorged on ? sh and on each other 's ? esh , Alef laid the pearls on Chaya 's cheeks , where , the night before , tears had shimmered . <br> He slept soundly , dreaming of quantum mechanics and rel &shy; ativity . By the time he awoke , his wife was no longer in bed be &shy; side him . Instead there was a note , telling him that she 'd gone to visit her parents . <br> Chaya had not been home in the year since her wedding . She had n't even responded to her father 's letters , laden with questions she 'd have been humiliated to answer and money she 'd have been ashamed to spend . She wrapped herself tight in her cloak as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner of a foreigner , lest anybody recognize her , pathetic creature , driven away by carriage , hobbling back shoeless . <br> She arrived at dusk . The house was quiet . The rebbetzin had gone to market , and Chaya 's brothers were now married to the daughters of a wealthy merchant , who had given each a small estate . She opened the door to her father 's study , and slipped inside . Without looking up from the tract he was writ &shy; ing , he asked her if an omniscient being could know ignorance . <br> She started to answer , and then stopped . She tried a differ &shy; ent approach , which brought her to another impasse , or per &shy; haps the same one from a different direction . At last she confessed that she was n't certain . <br> He set down his pen . With both arms , he embraced her . <br>  --  For months , I 've been trying to solve this problem , Chaya . In the ? rst month , I was certain that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforted that , if I did n't , then you would . In the third month , I became troubled that you could , yet I could n't . And in the fourth month , I became distraught that you could , but would n't . Ever since then , I have n't been able to write a word in these commentaries . All year , I dreamed that you would come to me like this , break the riddle , and spring me from my trap . But now that you 're here , and I hear that you do n't know either , I realize that the resolution does n't matter . I remained imprisoned by it only because I wanted to see you , but could n't . Your father is not very wise . <br>  --  And your daughter is not very good . At least I should have written . <br>  --  Your husband 's a sage , Chaya . It 's right that he com &shy; mands all your attention . <br>  --  Now you mock me . You know that Mama married me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred texts as well as you do ? <br>  --  He was illiterate until a couple of days ago . While you were busy with your learned commentaries , Mama married me to a ? sherman who ... who ... could be outsmarted by a lowly carp , and . . . <br>  --  Illiterate until a couple of days ago ? You 've been teach &shy; ing him , then ? <br> She shook her head . She told him everything that had hap &shy; pened . She laid two pearls on the table in front of him . She was mysti ? ed . Could he explain ? <br> The rabbi picked up the pearls , but did not scrutinize them . Instead , he peered into his daughter 's eyes . He saw that they had changed . It seemed that the light had dimmed , as he 'd once observed in his own bride . Then he perceived that the ? re he 'd previously seen from up close was now distant , insur &shy; mountably far from him , and , for the light to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighter than before . Chaya 's ardor made him shiver . He looked down and told her what the evidence made obvious : Her Alef had sold his soul to a dybbuk . Since she did not respond , he told her the consequences suf &shy; fered by people who bartered their souls , the agonies that he 'd witnessed , tortures that might have infected everyone had he not banished those cursed folks from the community . He re &shy; minded Chaya that life was passed down the generations by the soul 's nocturnal secretions , and that , because a man without a soul could not have children , his wife could legally divorce him . Chaya said that she never would . The rabbi nodded , for it was the response that he 'd expected . Then she asked him where she might meet this demon . <br> He stopped nodding . He stared at her . Even to utter the word dybbuk made him shudder , yet she wished to visit this crea &shy; ture as if he were a country pawnbroker. <br>  --  Chaya , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br>  --  And look what happened to him . Nobody goes to a dyb &shy; buk , except for one reason . <br>  --  That will give me an advantage in my negotiations . Trust me , Papa . My soul is not for sale . <br> Chaya put her hands on his . She contained their tremor . She gave him paper on which to draw a map . He made it swiftly , without lifting his pen , as if it were a sentence . The wet ink shone in the last sunlight . She kissed her father on the cheek , and hurried into the night . <br> The wolves already knew of Chaya , from what Alef had told them during his recent sojourn . They escorted her , a girl of much culture and little meat , at a respectful distance , discreetly protecting her from highway robbers and other predators who might take an interest in something other than her brains . They accompanied her to the forest clearing , where the demon was outdoors , tending his night garden . They watched her ap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their power to guard her from her own impudence . <br> The dybbuk cultivated mushrooms , each one as won &shy; drously hued as an orchid . Chaya looked over his shoulder at the one he was watering , and pronounced its name . The dyb &shy; buk dropped his cup . He 'd never before heard the word spoken aloud . He asked her to say it again . She uttered the name more slowly for him . He sighed . As magni ? cent as his fungus was , the sound was more spectacular : He knew that , to have earned such an appellation , there must be a ? ner specimen of the mush &shy; room elsewhere . <br> He might have enlisted Chaya 's expertise on care and feed &shy; ing , were it not unseemly for a demon to seek a girl 's advice . In &shy; stead , he invited her inside . He held the door for her . While he pulled it shut , she peered into the pickling barrel , at a thousand sunken souls . <br> She asked which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep records . I leave the auditing to the powers above , he said . And then he assured her that she need n't be bashful about giv &shy; ing up hers : The procedure left no mark on the body , and he guaranteed lifetime con ? dentiality . As long as she was discreet , no one would notice any change to her except , of course , that she 'd be vastly richer , or prettier , than before . <br>  --  I 'm not here to sell my soul . <br>  --  Nobody leaves my cottage without making a deal . <br>  --  Would you trade a soul for pearls ? <br>  --  How many gems would you like , little girl ? <br> Chaya frowned . She took the two pearlets that Alef had given her from a pocket in the apron of her skirt . She showed them to the demon . If he would return her husband 's soul , she said , he could have the gems , both of them . <br> He laughed at her . He laughed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . When she opened it , there were twenty pearls . And as soon as she shut it again , there were none . <br>  --  What will you take for it , then ? Our hovel ? Alef 's boat ? Would you return his soul if I offered you my body for the night ? <br>  --  Do n't you understand , rabbi 's daughter ? I 'm not a ship &shy; ping magnate or a real estate broker , and I 'm not a playboy either . I 'm a demon . Everything I want comes freely to me. <br>  --  Everything except a soul . <br>  --  So I collect them , one at a time , from folks who 've had them , scarcely aware , all along . I deem myself a connoisseur . <br>  --  And I consider you a glutton . <br> Chaya walked out on him . She trampled through his gar &shy; den , squashing exotic mushrooms , and trudged into the forest . <br> After several hours , morning dawned . Chaya was still in deep wood , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esh barely stretched skintight over his bones . He sat in the dirt , neither home nor wife in sight , surrounded by sacks such as those she 'd seen ragpickers carry . She asked if he was a beggar . <br>  --  You ca n't help me. <br>  --  Who says I 'm offering ? I have troubles of my own . What 's in the sacks ? <br>  --  The weight of my misfortune . <br> Chaya was a strong girl , given her slight build . She tried to lift a bag . She strained . She swore . She could n't budge it . So she looked inside , and was blinded . <br> While sight seeped back into Chaya 's eyes , she reached into the sack and scooped out a palmful of coins . They were unlike any she 'd ever seen , even the ancient and arcane denominations in the synagogue coffers . She could not decipher the inscrip &shy; tions on them , nor could she identify the species of beast adorning the face of each . Curiouser , though , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> As the bullion warmed in her palm and trickled through her ? ngers , she marveled at the purity of the metal . <br>  --  It 's twenty- ? ve- karat gold . That 's what I get for selling my soul . <br>  --  Then you , too , visited the dybbuk last night ? <br>  --  Last night ? I was there a decade ago . It 's taken ten years just to haul my hoard this far into the forest . <br>  --  Why do n't you leave it , if it 's only a hindrance ? <br>  --  Without my soul , this burden is all I 've got . The burden of my greed . And what did you take in exchange for your soul ? <br>  --  I did n't sell . <br>  --  Then you 're a very fortunate girl . All through these woods , you 'll come across folks who bartered theirs . <br>  --  Are they hard to ? nd ? Do you know them well ? <br>  --  What do I have to share with other people ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man had spoken truly . She saw many folks , always alone , some up in trees , others huddled on the ground . They shied like untame animals as she passed . She paused to gaze at a woman crouched in a bush . The girl wore nothing but dust and shadows . Blackberry brambles grew in her hair . Yet , even at a distance , Chaya could see that the girl 's softness would be the envy of a princess , and that her ripe lips could seduce a king . Chaya remarked that the girl was more beautiful than any she 'd ever met , and felt tingling inadequacy in her own ? esh . Glancing back at Chaya , the girl began to weep . <br>  --  What 's the matter ? <br>  --  You ca n't help me. <br>  --  I met a man who sold his soul for gold too heavy to carry . But what could be the burden of beauty ? <br>  --  You 've no idea . Before I went to that cursed dybbuk , I was an old hag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spit at my ugliness every day when I knelt to drink .

When he gave me this ? esh , he took away my dreams . <br>  --  But you could go to town and marry any man you wished . <br>  --  Marry ? I 'm a hundred years old , girlie . <br> Slowly she stood . Her back was bent , her legs bowed . She clamped a hand on Chaya 's arm , brittle bones quivering in their new skin . <br>  --  Do you still think I 'm such a beauty ? When the dybbuk took my soul , he left an emptiness . The ugliness festers there , where I ca n't even spit on it . <br> Chaya shuddered .

And found him humming to himself , cooking up a bouillabaisse . <br> Was Alef so stupid as not to be af ? icted ? Was he so smart ? Chaya was befuddled , and more so by the bouillabaisse , which was n't even native to their region . She asked if he knew what he was doing . He shrugged and made her sushi . <br> He did not inquire where she 'd been all night long . After supper , he simply brought her to bed and showed her how much he 'd missed her . What could be said ? In the essential re &shy; spects , she had to confess , Alef was the same . <br> Only the implications were different . Instead of giving up one ? sh , or even a dozen , Alef handed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He showed carpenters how to frame their houses taller , farmers how to plow their ? elds deeper , and millers how to motorize their operations , a plan that had to be scuttled for want of electricity . Day after day , Chaya watched her husband cure diseases and adjudicate dis &shy; putes . <br> It was harder for her than when he 'd been the town laugh &shy; ingstock . Everything he knew taught her all that she did not . And what was the bene ? t ? In the corner of the hovel , stewing like a bouillabaisse , she 'd watch him dole out ? sh by the bucket while giving away ideas that made other folks ' fortunes : An anesthetic . Movable type . An assembly line . By evening her vow would be broken in all but name , as she berated Alef for stupidly helping strangers ? eece him while he neglected his own devoted wife . To these complaints he 'd respond not with words but with pearls , which he 'd string together with kisses until all was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who 'd heard rumors of Alef 's genius , paid him a visit , and begged his expertise : The merchant wanted to know how to transmute lead into gold . As the ? sherman began to answer , Chaya sprang from her chair , and , screaming obscenities that would turn platinum into iron , chased the knave out the door . She stared at her husband , eyes ablaze . You are a fool , she hissed . <br> Alef nodded . A smile enveloped his face . <br>  --  For a long time , I did n't know , Chaya . You asked me every day , and I could n't tell you until ? nally I went to the dyb &shy; buk to ? nd out . <br>  --  You did n't have to do that . <br>  --  I did , though . It 's no simple question , like how to create gold . To comprehend what I do n't understand depends on knowing all there is to know . <br>  --  Alef , that 's nonsense . <br>  --  To discover the leak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chaya . At ? rst I thought that the dybbuk had misunderstood my wish , but the more wisdom I dispense , the more I ? nd what my head never held . <br>  --  And you are n't tormented by that ? <br>  --  A fool is never tormented . Torment is n't about what you do n't know . It 's about what you have and ca n't give . <br> After that , Chaya no longer interfered with Alef 's generos &shy; ity . Instead , she tried to emulate it . She found that giving was an effort , that , even with her impressive intellect , she could n't do as well as Alef did in his simplicity . She envied his foolishness . All night long she clung to him as her sole source of meaning . <br> And in the morning she 'd go out into the forest to tend to the soulless . She 'd bring them ? sh , which she taught them how to cook into a bouillabaisse . She 'd tell them that they did n't have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , they in ? icted on themselves . They consumed her ? sh , but rejected her logic . They said that to believe the soul was in &shy; signi ? cant , she must surely have lost her sense . <br> One day , after Chaya had given away every ? sh in her bas &shy; ket , she found herself near where the dybbuk lived . She decided to visit . <br> She stepped onto his deck , which seeped through her toes in the afternoon heat . She called out the demon 's name . He opened his door a crack , squinting into the sun , trying to ascer &shy; tain whether the heavens were in ? ames . Then he saw , standing on his stoop , hands on hips as if she were a neighbor , little Chaya. <br>  --  Do n't you see that it 's the middle of the day ? I 'm a crea &shy; ture of the night . What do you have in the basket ? <br>  --  It 's empty . There were ? sh in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't imagine what it 's like having a mouth but no appetite . <br> Chaya looked at the demon under the bright sun . His black hide shimmered with sweat , but his mouth was a void that trapped even light . His was a deeper hunger . <br>  --  Do you still want my soul ? I 've decided that you can have it . <br>  --  What will you take in exchange ? You 're pretty , but I can make you a queen . <br>  --  No , thank you . <br>  --  You 're clever , but I can make you a goddess . <br>  --  I 'll give you my soul , but I do n't want anything for it . <br>  --  Perhaps you 're not so shrewd after all . <br> In a single stroke , he reached his hand down Chaya 's throat and pulled her slender soul out . He brought it inside and plunged it , still breathing , into his vat . Then , because he wished her to have something in return , he showed her the exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gems skittering around on their eight- point crowns . He offered her any one she liked . They climbed across his knuckles . He fancied that he 'd never looked so princely . He did n't even see Chaya wave good- bye . <br> Years passed . As Alef and Chaya aged together , each grew to ? ll the space in the other where there 'd been a soul before . They never discussed it , for they 'd become too intimate for words . And nobody else noticed , so busy were they taking all that the couple gave . <br> Folks prospered . Their village became a town . Fine houses were built , and neighbors complained about Alef 's ungainly hovel . The fool and his wife moved into the slums . What ? sh they did n't give away was stolen . But that just saved them the hassle of distribution . <br> One evening they were visited by a very old man . While people often still came to pro ? t from Alef 's knowledge , none looked as needy as this fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked with a crook as knotted as his crippled body . <br> Chaya brought him a chair . She could n't see his face under the hat 's broad brim , but , the instant his eyes met hers , she felt sure that she 'd encountered him before . She asked the man if there was something they could do for him . <br> He shook his head . It was winter and getting dark , and he simply wished for a place to rest . <br> Chaya went to Alef , who was standing by the hearth , ladling bouillabaisse into a copper cup . She brought it to their guest . She sat by him while Alef prepared the bed in the ad &shy; joining room , where he and Chaya slept , so that the man could pass the night in comfort . The visitor did n't talk . He raised the cup to his mouth several times , but , when he set it down , it was always still full . Chaya asked if there was another meal that he 'd prefer , anything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Alef could tell him the cure for it . He shook his head again . She thought she heard him sigh , though it might have been the winter wind sweeping by . <br> Alef helped him to bed , and bade him a good night . The guest lay down on the straw mattress without removing cloak or hat . He pretended to sleep . And then he really did . <br> Some hours later , he was awoken by a noise in the other room . Without moving , he strained to hear if the couple was speaking of him . But the utterances were n't in any ordinary language . He concentrated on each syllable until it came to him that the two of them were n't making conversation . They were making love . <br> He waited awhile , until they were quiet . He waited some time more . He gripped his crook . Slowly he stood up . He stepped out of the bedroom . <br> The couple lay on the ? oor by the hearth , entwined in sleep . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked . Alef 's hands , creased with years , folded over Chaya 's shoulders . Her gray hair fell across his chest like an early frost . Their an &shy; cient guest crouched close . He saw the faint line of a smile where their wrinkled faces touched . <br> He went away before the light arrived . At the foot of the forest , he dropped his crook . Coming into the clearing where he lived , he tossed away his hat and cloak . The dybbuk went home more mysti ? ed than he 'd been when he 'd left . <br> He peered inside his pickling barrel . Ever since Chaya had freely given up her soul , he 'd wondered whether having such a thing was really so valuable . He 'd comforted himself with the torments of the soulless folks who wandered in the forest . But to look at Chaya and Alef ... He gazed into his vat , and he no longer saw what he 'd wanted . <br> The demon neglected his great occupation after that . He concerned himself with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hues that illuminated the night . These hobbies pleased him . He grew so affable that the wolves no longer feared him . They visited often , serenading the brightest orbs in his night garden as if he were raising new moons . <br> Gradually the pickling barrel dried out . The wood warped and cracked . The glands shriveled . The dybbuk did n't even no &shy; tice as they dissipated , and the forest dwellers dwindled . <br> At last , only the souls of Alef and Chaya remained . They shrunk into each other , creasing into a faint smile . And as they lost substance , some say , the demon 's own soullessness passed away . <br> Continues ...
