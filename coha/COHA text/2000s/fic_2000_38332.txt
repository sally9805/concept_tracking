Separating reality from fiction is n't always easy . In 1982 , the late Larry Walters achieved an odd sort of fame by doing pretty much what 's depicted in this story . Steve Boyett says he used to wonder why the guy did it . Then he was describing a friend as " someone without a brake pedal " and he flashed on Mr. Walters 's Icarian accomplishment ... and here 's the story that resulted . One likes to think that fiction and reality-the literal and the metaphorical-intersect occasionally in a region that we can call " the truth . " <p> ELDON TURNER IS BLOWING up balloons . One after the other from the helium tank , four-feet-wide neoprene balls he ties off and tucks under the fishing net he 's knotted onto his webbed aluminum recliner lawn chair . It 's hot enough to fry an oven and sweat gleams along his bowling-pin arms , glistens pale blue on the jailhouse tattoo sticking out from under the tight sleeve of his white shirt . Eldon 's humming along with the rock &; roll station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the netting . He 's feeling pretty swell , right goddamn spiffy if you want to know the truth . The downhill side of a second sweating pitcher of margaritas is largely accountable for this euphoria , and so fucking what ? The lawn chair skitters in a vagrant breeze . Tubular runner knocks BB pistol on unkempt lawn . The Buchers across the street have draped their porch in American  --  flag crepe for their party tonight ; already their little rugrats are puncturing the Azusa sky with bottle rockets . Howard Bucher flies for United and added a second story to his house last year ; Eldon is a self-employed welder , and just last week he bought a roll of screening to replace the panels that blew out of the back porch six months ago . Eldon sucks on the tank nozzle and sings along with the radio . " We got what you n-n-n-n-n-n-n-need , need , need ! " he sings in a chipmunk voice . Next he sucks on the dripping plastic pitcher ( he 's decided to cut out the middleman of a drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Behind him the torn screen door bangs open . " Burgers in five ! " calls Shirley . Eldon belches acknowledgment and the screen door chinks shut . Time for another balloon . With this one bulging the netting , the lawn chair strains at its tether tied to a tent stake pounded in the grass . " Down , boy , " Eldon tells the lawn chair , and pats its aluminum armrest . Across the street Howard Bucher passes by a living-room window , sees Eldon , waves , passes on . Returns a moment later . Frowning . Eldon waves , ties off a balloon , sucks on the tank . " You ai n't nothin " but a hound dog ! " he pipes . Howard is n't at the window now . Eldon 's laugh glissandos as his normal voice returns . What a gorgeous fucking day it 's turning out to be . Two more balloons and that tether 's nice and tight . Eldon likes the look of it ; that single thread is all that keeps him from being some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Orbur , right ? Fry the fiendly skies . " It 's now or never , " he sings , Elvis style . For his expedition Eldon provisions himself with staples : under the netting go boombox , sweating pitcher , BB pistol , Eldon his own damn self . The lawn chair settles but continues to tango with the vagrant breeze . What do you think , Captain Kirk ? I think a couple more balloons and we 'll be back aboard the Enterprise , Mr. Spock. l think a couple more margaritas and we wo n't need the balloons , Captain . Pshhhhh ! Getting kinds crowded in here . Like an ant inside a bunch of grapes . Pshhhhh ! Eldon glances back at the house . Shirley flipping burgers and toasting buns , Eldon Jr . and Stephanie , the Stealth refrigerator bandits , scarfing up Dreyer 's Cookies &; Cream for all they 're worth . Their every move and mouthing have been burned into his skull with a soldering iron . The Amazing Mechanical Family . " McFamily , " he says , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cord , doc . From a pocket unfolds his Buck knife . The lawn chair lists to starboard when he leans and saws . Pitcher cold against a thigh . Bob Seger on the radio . Bottle rockets hiss away across the street . Scouting ahead , he thinks as the knife cuts through . The parted rope coils spineless ; the lawn chair rises . THROUGH CHESSBOARD GAPS in the webbing Eldon sees his house roof dwindle . There 's a sunbleached Frisbee up there . Down there ! He claps his hands and laughs . He 's flying , he 's flying ! This contraption has about as much right to he in the sky as a Holstein , but big deal . So does an airplane . Flying , running on the wind , patchwork quilt beneath him snug against the dragonback tail of San Gabriel range stretching shadows eastward . Hoo-hoo-hoo . Something whizzes by his lawn chair trailing smoke . Eldon leans left and the lawn chair tilts obligingly . The pitcher rolls against the netting and sweats a tiny rain . Eldon gazes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bucher 's house , where one of the rugrats peers up with a hand hooding his eyes . Howard Bucher joins him and the kid points up . Moon white of Buchers face . Eldon gives him the finger and stabilizes his lawn chair . He scuds along the breeze rising like a bubble in the ocean , rises till he can cover his house with his hand , his palm , his thumb . He looks like a comic-strip character surrounded by blank thoughts . Getting kinda cold . How high up is he ? How high up will this thing go ? Lighter than air , so it 'll seek its own air pressure . How the hell high is that ? You need oxygen after like ten thousand feet . That 's nearly two miles ! Limned against the horizon is a distant Piper Cub . Eldon and his lawn chair are even with it . Eldon makes propeller noises with his lips . The land below is a contour map of itself . Another margarita , Mr. Turner ? Why , thanks , jocko , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but 1 ca n't let you have another drink unless you give me the keys to your lawn chair . A cluster bomb of loud commercials explodes across the radio . Eldon switches it off . The sudden quiet seems unnatural . Flying ought to have some kind of noise . Just the act of flying should generate sound . For a few minutes it 's peaceful ; Eldon feels he 's touched the core of something , something pure like the note from a nail against a crystal goblet . But the goblet fractures and fear intrudes : suddenly naked and exposed and drunk as a sailor 's leave . He 's cold and sunburned and the chair straps are branding a checkerboard across his ass and he has to piss like a fire hydrant , and more than that he does n't belong up here ! His lawn chair 's heading toward a bank of clouds . Jesus , how high up are clouds ? Had he even seen clouds when he was on the ground ? The late afternoon sun has burnt their edges , turbulent undersides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasps , slick-palmed , heart jackhammering . Jumping Jesus on a trampoline , what has he done ? From out the rumpled cloth of clouds there comes an angel . Radiant pale and feather-winged glides toward him . Alabaster-faced regards him dark-eyed inscrutable . " I 'm sorry ! " says Eldon , crying now . " Jesus , I 'm sorry , it was just a gag , I did n't mean- " But he feels the angel is not judging him but has only come to bless him and guide him down . Down , oh , down . From under his thigh he pulls the BB pistol . Draws down on a balloon and fires . The clap of its demise , though thinned , is shocking , here . The angel is gone and in its place a seagull glides by grating . The lawn chair no longer climbs . Eldon fires again and another balloon gives up the ghost . The lawn chair leans left and sinks as if through gelatin . The last gasp of a third balloon opposite the first two rights him somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head feels clearer too . The panic returns to its basement room and contents itself with an occasional happy rattle of its chains . Down and down . No faster than this or he 'll do a Dorothy-hits-Oz dance . Maybe kill a wicked witch . The chessboard life below is broadening its horizons into familiar territory . There 's the 210 Freeway , there 's the Safeway , there 's the National Guard Armory . There 's a lot of traffic stopped for some reason . Stopped for him , he realizes , and waves hello . Eldon turns on the radio . Building level now , tree level . Rock &; roll is such good music . Ahead of him are telephone poles and thin smiles of drooping power lines . The wind propels him toward them and he is n't sinking fast enough to drop below . No rudder on this thing , no brakes . Traffic stopped on the street below . People waving , cheering , calling up . Lineman on the power pole , waves frantically at him , returns to furious work . Trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it before 1 hit ? And thinks about the quiet up there high and away , the serene face of his angel , the pure he 'd almost grabbed , and realizes that if he does , that 's okay , and if he does n't , well , that 's all right , too . - for Brother Paul <p>
