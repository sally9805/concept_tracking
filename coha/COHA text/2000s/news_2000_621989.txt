<p> A year ago , Daniel Mauser told his father he was concerned about a loophole in the Brady law that he felt made it too easy for people to buy guns . <p> It was only a passing remark , and Tom Mauser did n't give it much thought . But two weeks later , his 15-year-old son was gunned down in the school library by two students on a deadly shooting spree in a quiet Denver suburb . <p> It is a year later , and Tom Mauser , who is still mourning his son 's death , is a passionate gun-control advocate . <p> " I want to do something in his name , " Mauser said of Daniel , a shy , slender teenager who was good in math and science and loved videogames but did n't know what he wanted to do when he grew up . <p> Today is the first anniversary of the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton , Colo . On that day two heavily armed teenagers stormed the school shortly before noon and during an hourlong ram-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . While gun-wielding students have attacked classmates and teachers at other suburban schools , Columbine stands as the worst school massacre in the nation 's history . <p> Images of a school turned into a bloody battlefield still linger , a haunting reminder for parents who saw their greatest fear become reality . <p> But the legal impact has been limited . Several states , including California , passed gun control legislation . But during the same period , the gun lobby successfully pushed through bills that protect the industry from lawsuits in 17 states . <p> Some 31 cities and counties are pursuing lawsuits against the industry . But legislation on the federal level has all but stalled in Congress . <p> Although success with legislation has been limited , gun control advocates say the school siege has prompted an unprecedented public outcry . National polls since Columbine show a majority of Americans favor stronger regulations of guns and stricter enforcement of current laws . The fervor that has long driven those who oppose limits on guns is now driving gun control advocates . <p> " There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of Handgun Control . Columbine , he said , shattered the myth that gun violence is a problem limited to cities , minorities and gangs . <p> " Every parent in the country became concerned about sending their child to school , " he said . People who had passively supported gun control now are motivated to take an active role in a burgeoning crusade against gun violence , Tolley said . <p> TAKING ACTIVE ROLE <p> Daniel 's father said he supported gun-control laws before the shooting " but I never did anything about it . " After the shooting , Mauser took a leave from his job as a manager for the Colorado Transportation Department and is now director of political affairs for SAFE Colorado , a bipartisan group formed after the killings . <p> " I feel like I should do something to help close that loophole , " he said . <p> Such changes , say legal experts , may take time . <p> " As a symbolic passage in the American gun battle , ( Columbine ) is enormously important , " Franklin Zimring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California at Berkeley , said . But in the short term , he said , it might have a greater impact on the politics surrounding gun control than on laws regulating the industry . <p> For their part , gun advocates dismiss the notion of Columbine as a catalyst for change . While the school rampage intensified media coverage , they say the public remains skeptical that more curbs on firearms will stop the seemingly endless stream of violent crimes . <p> Instead of favoring new restrictions , voters support stronger enforcement of existing laws , gun advocates say . <p> The two killers at Columbine broke 19 state and federal laws , said Ed Worley , California liaison for the National Rifle Association . " Would having one more law on the books stop the animals from doing what they did ? " he asked . <p> The gun-control advocates and the NRA represent old adversaries in a struggle over guns that for years has split along traditional political lines . Republicans generally have supported the constitutional rights of gun owners while Democrats generally have backed regulations that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killers . <p> Both sides insist they are morally and legally right , and they trot out polls to show that they have the support of the American people . <p> DYNAMIC SHIFTED <p> But Columbine blurred the lines between supporters and opponents of gun controls , especially among lawmakers . <p> In Congress , gun advocates and opponents have been locked in a yearlong stalemate , each side blaming the other for being unwilling to compromise . <p> So far , legislation proposed by gun-control advocates in the Republican-controlled Congress has been , for the most part , small change , said Zimring at Berkeley . " For $1.50 of gun control , ( Democrats ) want $1 million impact , " he said . <p> Immediately after Columbine , the U.S. Senate passed a series of modest gun control measures , including a ban on sales to minors and a requirement of safety locks on handguns . But the measures have n't budged from a House-Senate conference committee , which met only once , in August . <p> " Sadly , it 's all politics , " said Rep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed previous gun control measures . " Both sides do n't want to have a bill , " he said . " They seem to want an election issue and not legislation . " <p> MANDATORY PRISON TERMS <p> With nothing to show after a year 's worth of effort , the House last week overwhelmingly passed legislation sponsored by McCollum that would provide $100 million to states that impose mandatory prison terms for criminals caught with a gun . <p> Some Democrats dismiss the bill as minor legislation that will do little to reduce gun violence . <p> Gun control advocates say they have had far greater success on the state and local level . In the past year , eight states have passed gun control laws and three traditionally pro-gun states  --  Colorado , Utah and Oregon  --  have proposed initiatives . <p> Republican governors in New York , Colorado , Illinois and Ohio who were considered conservatives on regulation have come out in support of gun-control legislation . Meanwhile , 31 cities and counties , including San Francisco , are pursuing lawsuits against the industry . <p> CALIFORNIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement has been California , which passed five major laws after Columbine , including the nation 's most comprehensive assault weapons ban . <p> Days after the Colorado massacre , the Assembly narrowly approved a measure that would limit the purchase of handguns to one a month . Lawmakers rejected a similar bill two years before , but this time , with the horror of Columbine still fresh in their minds , they approved the restriction . <p> Gun advocates say that the key to the passage of the gun control laws was not Columbine but the 1998 election of a Democratic governor as well as a Democratic-controlled Senate and Assembly . <p> " This is all stuff that they 've been trying to get through for years , " said Gerald Upholt , manager of governmental affairs for the California Rifle and Pistol Association , which had opposed each of the laws . <p> While those favoring gun control agree that Davis ' support was critical , they see this as an issue that crosses party lines . <p> " We feel very strongly that gun safety is a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat who co-sponsored a safety locks bill . " That 's what Columbine said to everybody . " <p> MOMS ON THE MARCH <p> And where there are children , there are parents . So while the usual political adversaries continue to spar , a powerful new lobbying force has entered the gun debate . <p> On Mother 's Day , May 14 , sponsors of the Million Mom March expect more than 150,000 people to descend on Washington , D.C. , to rally in favor of gun regulations . Backers say a total of 1 million mothers and their families are expected to demonstrate at the nation 's capital and at satellite rallies in 30 cities , including Oakland , Sacramento and Los Angeles . And not all of them will be Democrats . <p> " It 's going to be the gun movement 's Woodstock " said Mary Leigh Blek , an honorary chair of the march . Blek , a lifelong Republican from Orange County , has been working for gun regulations ever since her 21-year-old son , Matthew , was shot to death during a robbery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , " said Blek , western regional director of the Bell Campaign , a grass-roots group striving to put gun laws on the books at the local , state and national levels . Blek said that many Republican women support gun control laws , unlike many of the party leaders . <p> " The Million Mom March is going to show our power , " she said . <p> STILL MUSCLE TO FLEX <p> Nonetheless , gun advocates have had the power for years , and they point to some legislation in the past year that shows they still have considerable political might : a ban on cities and counties suing the gun industry . <p> The legislation has passed in 17 states and is pending in two more . <p> " The American people do n't have a very strong belief that gun control laws are effective in solving gun violence , " said Jim Manown , a spokesman for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax , Va . " I do n't think any of these tragic incidents have resulted in any change in public opinion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been stronger . The organization boasts a membership of 3.5 million , with 300,000 new members joining since the beginning of the year . <p> Mauser , Daniel 's father , who has been working in support of a Colorado initiative aimed at closing the loophole that allows those who purchase guns at gun shows to avoid background checks , said he initially was frustrated after state lawmakers failed to pass the measure . <p> But he said his job managing transit for a car-loving state prepared him " for the realities of being a David against Goliath . " <p> " I do n't know what it 's going to take to stop the gun violence , " he said . " Obviously it 's going to take a lot .
