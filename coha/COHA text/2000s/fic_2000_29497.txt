It 's worse than a crime , it 's a blunder . - Antoine Boulay De La Meurthe " The devil you say . " Adam Dagenham , Marquis of Daventry , settled his long , lean body more comfortably against the pillar at the edge of the dance floor and smiled indolently at the man who had spoken . " The devil I do say , sir . You asked the identity of that ' glorious hoyden in the sea-green gown ' and I replied : ' my wife ' . Now , do you run off , terrified of my wrath , or linger to offer your condolences ? " " My felicitations would be more likely , " the gentleman replied in his deep , melodious voice , bowing most formally to Daventry . " Allow me , if I might , to introduce my blundering self . I am Burnell . Edmund Burnell . Late of points south and east , all of them most forgettable , and for the moment residing in London with my dear aunt , the Lady Gytha Jagger . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for my answer when I first inquired as to the identity of-well , of your wife . I imagine she thought she was being amusing . " " Ah , Lady J , " Daventry said , shooting a quick glance to the rank of dowagers . He spotted the hatchet-faced old woman waving one gloved and heavily ringed hand and favored her with a slight inclination of his head , acknowledging the hit . " Dear , dear , old bitch . She does enjoy her fun , does n't she ? " Daventry took one last look toward the dance floor and at his wife . He saw the sparkle of her smile , the overbright glitter in her green eyes , more than a hint of slim ankle as she lifted her skirts and moved with the dance . Yes . That was his wife all right . Charlotte Victor Dagenham , Marchioness of Daventry . Sherry . His Sherry . And he was her Adam . For their sins . . . . He lazily , belatedly , introduced himself , then pushed away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Edmund Burnell . Tall . Blond . Quite handsome in both his face and dress . Charming smile . Laughing blue eyes . Intelligent blue eyes . Likable . Interesting fellow . Very interesting . Well , diverting , at least . God knew Daventry needed a little diversion . " Crushing bore , this ball , is n't it ? Probably the flattest of this short Fall Season . At least of some of us , " Daventry said , shooting his cuffs , looking at the man , assessing him even as he smiled . " Burnell ? I was just about to go drown myself in some of Lady Petersham 's best brandy . Do you care to join me ? " Edmund Burnell frowned slightly , his gaze flitting swiftly to the marchioness of Daventry before he smiled at his new acquaintance . " You 'll leave her here ? Unprotected ? " Daventry threw back his dark head and laughed . " Unprotected ? My wife ? You have it the wrong way round , friend . I leave London unprotected . Now , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cards . You do play , do n't you ? " " Oh , yes , " Burnell replied smoothly , following after Daventry , his cool blue gaze still on the marchioness . " I always enjoy a game . " Sherry stood in front of the glass , watching her husband 's reflection as he prowled the bedchamber , wanting to leave , knowing he would not . Could not . It would be better if he did leave . She could scream then . Tear at her hair . Throw herself across the bed and weep until she slept . Dreamed . Woke sobbing . How handsome he was , even when his face wore the dark scowl that had become so familiar , too familiar . He was angry with her again , of course . He was always angry with her . Disappointed in her . Perhaps even sickened by her . It had n't always been this way . Once , he had been amused , intrigued . Once , she had been theworld to him . Or so he 'd said . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world that way . Before . . . And , now , after . . . " Darling ? " she said , forcing lightness into her voice , a smile to her lips . " Emma has wandered off somewhere , as usual , and it would be fruitless for me to ring for her . Could you come help me with my gown ? " Adam 's head came up as he stopped his pacing , looked in her direction . " She 's done another flit ? I do n't know why you keep the woman , Sherry . She 's worthless . " Sherry lifted her hands to fumble ineffectually with the heavy diamond clasp of the Daventry family pearls , her head bowed so that he could n't see her face . " She 's the only one who can make some manageable sense of this infernal mop on my head , darling . Besides , she-she amuses me . " " Oh , well , if she amuses you , " Adam said , his voice dripping sarcasm . " Far be it from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , let me get that , before you have six generations of Dagenhams spinning in their graves as you rip the string and beads go flying into mouse holes in the corners . " He used to be able to tell when she was lying . Had he lost that talent , or had she begun to lie better these past months ? Or perhaps he simply did n't care anymore . Sherry bit her lip as she lowered her arms , watching in the mirror as Adam stepped behind her , his fingers brushing her neck with fire as he neatly rescued the pearls . His hands lingered against her skin , searing a light , fluttering pattern she 'd feel for hours . In a moment , her fastenings were open , and her gown hung loose from her shoulders . He then moved his attention to the combs in her hair . She watched as the mass of living fire slid from its pearl-encrusted anchors , cascading down , a heavy waterfall of bright color reaching nearly to her waist . Her skin looked so white against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection of her husband 's hands as he drew her hair away from her shoulders , as his fingers made their way along her skin , pushing the gown from her shoulders so that it puddled in a soft green foam at her feet . No . He was n't about to leave her . Everything else had been lost , irrevocably broken . But there was still this , God help them both . Maybe it had been all they 'd ever had . She tilted her head slightly , inviting his kiss against her throat . Longing for it . Praying for it . Offering up her soul in exchange for it . She closed her eyes . " There , that should do , " Adam said , and she felt the cold evening air reach her as he walked away , turning his back on her , on his own desires . " I made a new acquaintance tonight , darling , " he went on as he shrugged himself out of his jacket , tossed it toward a chair already piled high with Sherry 's clothing-clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A Mr. Edmund Burnell . Delightful chap . I think he 's infatuated with you . But , then , so is the rest of London . " " Except for you , " Sherry whispered under her breath . Pinning a bright smile on her face , she stepped away from her gown , remembering the times Adam had delighted in slowly , guided by kisses , divesting her of her undergarments . " How lovely , " she then said , walking behind a Chinese screen , ruthlessly wrestling off her remaining finery before slipping her arms into a diaphanous dressing gown . " You should have introduced us , Adam , " she continued , moving out from the protection of the screen once more as she tied the satin ribbons at her throat . She gave back pain for pain . " I 'm always delighted to meet a new admirer . " She watched as her husband 's deep brown eyes flickered betrayingly for a moment as he ran his gaze over her artfully concealed and revealed body . He would n't leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew . But he would n't leave her alone tonight . Not after she had teased him so unmercifully at Lady Petersham 's insipid ball . She had danced , whirled , flirted , enticed , invited . Dancing with everyone but Adam . Dancing only for Adam . Salome , without the veils . Bring me the heart of Adam Dagenham , she had chanted fervently as she smiled and danced and flirted and laughed . Bring me his love , as I 've once known it . He hated her for the way she acted , but he had left her no other avenue , no other way to fight , and she lacked the strength it would take to surrender . And , even if he hated her , he still desired her . As long as he desired her , she had hope . " You 're right , of course . I should have introduced him to you . Maybe next time , " Adam said , reaching for his snifter of brandy . His ever-present snifter of brandy . He had never drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She had pushed him into a bottle . Just one more sin he would n't forgive her . She heard his next words through a faint buzzing in her ears . " Yes , I 'll definitely introduce him to you . I would n't want you to think he 's forbidden fruit . We all know your taste for that , do n't we ? " Sherry lifted the back of her hand to her cheek as she turned her head from him , recoiling from the verbal blow he 'd struck , stifling a sudden sob . " That 's all in your mind , Adam . No one else 's . " Then , squaring her shoulders , she turned to glare at him . " Stop it , Adam . Just stop it , all right ? " " Ah , darling , if only I could , " Adam said , putting down the snifter and advancing toward her once more . His own cheeks were flushed now , as if with fever . " Was n't beauty enough , Sherry ? Was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London Society ? Was n't my heart enough ? " She watched , dying inside , as his entire body shuddered slightly , the involuntary movement almost indiscernible . " Why was n't my heart enough ? " " It was-it is , " she told him , made stupid in her need , by the love that became so volatile when mixed with exasperation . " It 's you who have turned away- " " I 'm running for my life , Sherry , " he told her quietly . " Even as I come to you , inside me , in my head , I 'm running for my life . My sanity . " " Then go , " she cried out challengingly , her heart aching , her arms empty . " Just go ! " It was his turn to close his eyes , to look away . " Dear God , " he breathed quietly , the anguish in his voice tearing at her , giving her hope at the same time . He looked at her once more , his dark eyes glowing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . " I 'm not that strong . " Against all of her instincts , Sherry backed up a pace , put her hands out to ward him off . For a moment she was the near child she 'd been when he 'd met her , loved her , changed her life forever . " No , Adam . Please . I 'd thought-but , no . Not this way . Please , not this way . . . " But it was always this way . If not love , then need . If not his heart , then his body . It was all he had to give her . And she would take anything he would give her . Even shame . There had never been shame before , but they 'd made love before , created love between them . She did n't know what it was they did now . Her empty arms were filled with him . Her hands clung as he lifted her , carried her , placed her on the bed where she lay , eyes closed , waiting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shredded her nerves . And then he was beside her . His mouth claimed hers . His hands found their way beneath her dressing gown , found her . She was light-headed before his mouth left hers , traveled to her throat , her breast , robbing her of even the memory of breath . His hands molded her , shaped her to fit his every need , her every desire . He kissed her . Kissed her breasts . Kissed her belly . He moved lower , became more intimate . Kissed her again . " Adam . " His name was a curse on her lips , a benediction . A plea for love or , if not love , at least physical possession . Now . Now , before she burst into flame , crumbled into ashes . Rising as best she could , Sherry frantically beat on his back with her closed fists . Pulled at him , urged him upward , clasped him to her tightly even as he settled himself over her , buried himself deep inside her . He rocked against her , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again . Taking them higher , higher . Freeing them from words , from regrets , from memory . They were together now . One now . It was all they had left . . . . Midmorning sunlight wove its way through the ivory-lace curtains , traced dappled patterns on the dish-covered breakfast table of the mansion in Grosvenor Square . Sherry , always an early riser , had already breakfasted in her chamber and was , Adam knew , even now sunk deep in a hot , fragrant tub . Washing herself clean of him , arming herself for another day of battle . He had broken his fast alone , at nine , and followed his eggs and country ham with a snifter of brandy in the solitude of his study . But he 'd heard the wheels rumble against the snatches of bare tile floor in the hallway a quarter hour ago , and knew he 'd find Geoff in the breakfast room . Lord Geoffrey Dagenham . His younger brother . His beloved , silly , senselessly damaged only brother . His heir until , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which might be sooner than later if he kept repeating the mistakes of last night . Adam saw the back of the Bath chair first , its high , stiff back , its caning-the web it seemed to weave around his brother , trapping him in its seat , between its large wheels . He saw the thatch of dark blond hair , then the wide smile Geoff turned on him , the determined cheer in a pair of sky-blue eyes . Adam 's gut clenched . A tic began its work beside his left eye . " Ah , Adam , " Geoff said , waving his brother to a chair . " Looking your usual grumpy self , I see . Do n't you ever weary of it ? " Adam took the chair his brother had indicated , the table blocking the sight of Geoff 's legs . " Do n't you ever weary of that chair ? " Geoff shook his head . " I 'm much more weary of your constant references to it , frankly . Besides , I 'm not at all attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into kindling . My latest leech swears it . He may be right , or he may admire the color of all the gold you 're stuffing in his pockets , all the money you 've stuffed in so many pockets as we languish here in town , on the hunt for miracles . Shall I ring for Rimmon to fetch you a snifter ? I 'm well aware of how closely our dear butler guards you , how he feeds your new vice . Or is he busy filling brandy decanters ? Lord knows that 's occupation enough to keep the man busy around here of late . " Adam reached for a cold piece of toast he did n't really want , ignoring his brother 's remarks . " Do you plan to go out today ? The sun 's warm enough . Perhaps some fresh air- " " Ah , yes , indeed ! " Geoff interrupted . " Some fresh air . That should do it . A push through the park , some soft late-autumn breezes , a bit of sun , a giggle or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some comely , nubile young sylphs as they dash by , on the hunt for upright men . I do so enjoy my excursions to the park . " " Damn it , Geoff ! " Adam exploded , tossing down the uneaten toast . " One minute hot , the next cold . I never know what to say to you , how you 'll react . And to see you still talking with her , laughing with her as if nothing had happened ? After what she helped do to you- " " Sherry did nothing to me I did n't do to myself , Adam , " his brother interrupted , banging his fist on the tabletop for emphasis . " She tried to stop me . And if your head were n't so thick , and your pride so stiff-backed , you 'd see it . " Adam sat back in his chair , rubbed a hand across his eyes . " Oh , yes . Sherry had nothing to do with it . She never encouraged any of those mad starts , the games , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them myself . For a time . But then I warned her , warned you- " " Lie to me , Adam , but not to yourself . You did more than enjoy the games , " Geoff broke in . " You joined in with us , at least for a time . You reveled in Sherry , in seeing Sherry happy . How could you help it ? She 's infectious . " " So , I understand , is smallpox , " Adam bit out , shaking his head . " Yes , our flights of fancy amused me , as they were innocent enough . But then we began the races . Those damnable races . The first was a lark . And the second . But then it became dangerous . Our whole lives became dangerous . I warned you , I warned you both . It was one thing for you to openly disobey me , but Sherry promised me-promised me-she 'd put an end to her involvement . And she lied , Geoff . She lied . When I found her with him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tic now working furiously . " No , Geoff . Do n't object , tell me I 'm unreasonable . I wo n't allow myself to beat my head against that particular stone wall this morning . I did n't come in here to discuss any of this again . I certainly did n't come in here to listen , yet again , as you defend my indefensible wife , her inexcusable actions . " " Perhaps you 'd be better pleased if you could just cast off the shameless baggage , darling , and have done with it ? " Sherry asked from the doorway . " I know I most certainly would oppose a public flogging , but there have been times these past months a scandalous bill of divorce would have seemed almost a blessing . Good morning , Geoff . I 'm here to accompany you to the park . If we 're lucky enough to find a chestnut man on the way , we can crack our treats open under your wheels when we get down and take our stroll . " Adam stiffened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife 's progress as she floated into the room , dropping a kiss on Geoff 's adoring head before seating herself beside him . Geoff took her hand in his , lifted it , pressed a kiss against her smooth white skin . She appeared both glorious and beautiful in her watered-sunshine morning gown , her cheeks still flushed from her bath , her dark-fire hair a tumble of curls , falling from a topknot that should look silly but that , on her , succeeded in being most eminently becoming , endearingly charming in its simplicity . Adam died , yet again . It had been like this for more than three months . It was getting so he barely noticed each new death . " Adam ? " his brother jibed as the silence became more than uncomfortable . " If we 've given you time enough to withdraw your foot from your mouth , perhaps you 'll ring for Rimmon , and your wife and I can be on our way ? Oh-do you care to accompany us ? You 're most certainly invited . Sherry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course he is , " she said , plucking at the blanket tucked across Geoff 's knees as it began slipping toward the floor . " Adam ? " she asked , looking up at him , her eyes so shadowed with unspoken pain that he nearly forgot , only for a moment . But he could never forget for more than that moment . It was his curse , and hers . And Dickie 's victory . " I think not , darling , thank you , " he said coolly , already on his way to the hall . " I 'll send Rimmon to you as I head out , having promised to meet with Mr. Burnell at White 's just at noon . You may remember my mentioning his name to you ? We 've four invitations awaiting us for this evening , my dear . Feel free to pick and choose among them . Or perhaps you 'd like to make an appearance at all four ? It makes no difference to me where you choose to disgrace yourself tonight . " He was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite deliberately , " You know , Geoff , I 've been thinking of a small diversion for you . If I were to procure a Bath chair of my own , we could take them both to the top of that lovely , grassy hill in the park . . . " Adam slammed out of the house , entirely forgetting both his cane and to instruct Rimmon to attend his brother . Sherry looked around at the park , at the fading , yet-still-magnificent glory of flowers and greenery , and smiled sadly . She adored London , if not her reason for being here during the small Fall Season rather than at Daventry Court , where she , Adam , and Geoff had retired after the King 's birthday in June . How happy the Spring Season had been . Her first Season as a married woman , as the marchioness of Daventry . She had considered herself the most fortunate woman on earth , to have met Adam , to have him fall in love with her , to have become his wife . The Season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls , visits to the theater , silly , absurd picnics with eight hundred or more persons in attendance , revels that began in the early afternoon and lasted well into the evening . And always , always , with Adam by her side . She loved to laugh . Adam loved to laugh . Their mad , impulsive courtship had been full of laughter and stolen kisses , from the first . She loved him . Ah , how she loved him . How he 'd loved her . All through that magical Spring Season . And yet ? And yet ? How afraid Sherry still had been that he would wake one day and realize that he desired her , yes , but that their marriage was a mistake . That he had married a silly , witless child . For all the wrong reasons . That he was bored with her . She 'd put her fears away for the duration of the Season and enjoyed London . But once they 'd returned to Daventry Court , to the quiet of the countryside , Sherry 's fears had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that summer , too busy to laugh with her as he 'd done in London . She began to think his interest was waning , his love disappearing beneath a mountain of reports on cottages needing thatch and pesky , clogged ditches to be drained . She sighed audibly , remembering the day she had been sitting beside the stream , worrying about her failings as the wife of a marquess . It had been then that she 'd met Richard Brimley , brought the man into all of their lives . . . . " Well , that sounded heartfelt , " Geoff said , touching Sherry 's hands as they lay loosely curled in her lap . " Have you changed your mind , sweetheart ? Perhaps I have , too . The park is well enough from this vantage point , but I admit to dreading the moment our sturdy coachman stops the carriage and the footman lifts me down into my chair . Strange . I used to rather enjoy making a cake of myself . " Sherry shoved her unhappiness quickly to the back of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , but only think what would happen if Biggs were to drop you ? Plop ! A Daventry on the drive ! Why , I imagine I would be crushed in the stampede of young ladies rushing to your rescue . Should I whisper a hint in his ear , do you think ? " " We 'd better not . I do n't flirt half so well on my arse , sweetheart , " Geoff said , but he was smiling now , so that Sherry relaxed . " Still , I do n't think I 'll ask to stop and have my chair put out , if you do n't mind . We 'll just keep riding , and I 'll sniff up the fresh air as you 've told me I should , and I 'll tip my hat to the ladies . Much better than tipping my- " " You 've said the word once , Geoff , and that 's quite enough , " she told him , wagging a finger in his face . " And Adam says I have corrupted you ? Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " " Better yet , he should be dropped on his- " " Geoff . . . " Sherry warned . " Head , Sherry . I was about to say he should be dropped on his head . Maybe it would shake some sense into his brains . To watch him with you , listen to him with you-well , I never thought my brother could be so stupid . Thick , that 's what he is . Thick as a plank . " Sherry began pleating the long ribbon of her pelisse . " He did find us together , Geoff , " she reminded him , wishing her eyes would n't sting so with sudden tears , tears she refused to allow permission to fall . " If only I could push time back , have it all to do over again . " Geoff playfully pinched at her cheek . " What ? You mean you ca n't do that , sweetheart ? Well , I 'm crushed . I thought you could do anything . Which is why I have n't yet wielded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'll come around , Sherry . He blames you because he ca n't blame himself , or me , seeing as how I 'm stuck in that damnable chair for the moment . " " Because of me . " " Because of me , sweetheart . You begged me not to attempt that last race , told me the course was dangerous in the rain . I must have been insane . We both know Dickie goaded me into it , fool that I was . " " Adam thinks I goaded you into it . He thinks that , after promising him I would n't have anything more to do with . . . with the races , that I 'd handed you my favor and sent you out to be crippled , perhaps die . " " You can say his name , sweetheart , " Geoff prodded as the carriage slowed to a stop . " The races were secondary . You promised Adam you would n't have anything more to do with Richard Brimley . Dear , deceitful , dangerous Dickie . He certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder where he 's gone . " Sherry 's jaw tightened . " To hell , I hope . " She lifted her head , realizing that the carriage had stopped , and saw that Lady Gytha Jagger 's equipage had come abreast of theirs . Even now her ladyship was all but bouncing herself across the width of the seat , bringing herself close enough for conversation below a bellow . " Why , Lady J , " Sherry said , pushing her dark thoughts away in order to be polite to the old woman , " how good to see you this afternoon . You 're looking well . " The old woman sniffed , her hatchet nose puncturing the air . " Liar . I look wretched and have always done . Was n't even pretty as a gel , you know . Passable , I suppose , but never pretty . Never like you , my dear . So , you 'll come to dinner this evening ? You and that mad , brooding husband of yours ? You , too , Lord Dagenham . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in town , you see , and he and Daventry have struck up a friendship . " Sherry frowned , trying to remember the name Adam had flung at her , twice , in the midst of his usual insults . " Mr. Burnell ? " she asked hopefully . " Precisely ! Dear , dear Edmund . He was much taken with you last night , m'dear , not that he got to say two words to you . But he and Daventry got on famously , I believe . At least Edmund remarked this morning that he 'd be more than delighted if I were to have you all to dinner this evening . You 'll come , wo n't you ? " " Geoff ? " Sherry asked as she looked at her brother-in-law , knowing he had so far refused any invitations to socialize . " Adam said I could pick any entertainment I wanted for this evening , remember ? It would be good for you to be out and about again . And it would be a small party . " She turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would n't it ? " " Infinitesimal , my dears , " Her Ladyship said sprightly . Sherry bit her lip , looking hopefully to Geoff once more . It would be so good for him to enter society again , concentrate on something other than his injury and her sinking relationship with her husband . " My goodness , Sherry , you look as if you literally want to pull my agreement out of me . " He shrugged eloquently . " Oh , why not , sweetheart , " he said , looking to Lady Jagger . " We 'd be delighted , ma'am . Tell me-do I bring my own carriers , or are your footmen brawny enough to hoist me up your stairs ? " Adam was faintly surprised by the decor of the room Edmund Burnell led him to after dinner , then remembered that once , long ago , Lady J had been married . Strange , though , as the man had been underground and unlamented these twenty years , that she had n't done the study over in some more feminine fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fresh air . The room was oppressively dark . Dark paneling , dark drapes , dark wood . A large room , made small by the dark but never cozy ; a high-ceilinged room , whose top disappeared beyond the candlelight , the glow of the fire . He recognized the mantelpiece as being one designed by Sir William Chambers . It had been carved in a single huge piece of black marble that included matching four-foot-high female figures partially released from the stone , their attire rather scanty , although their hands seemed to be drawn into an attitude of prayer . Carpets the shade of clotted blood matched the blood-red velvet draperies , their oriental design added to only with vague designs picked out in black and gold . The chair Adam sat in , however , was completely comfortable . Chippendale had been at the top of his form with chairs , he knew , and this one was no exception , even if its Chinese style did not appeal . Edmund Burnell sat in the chair 's mate , warming a brandy snifter between his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're waiting for my reaction , I imagine ? " Adam said , indicating the room with a languid wave of his right hand , his left fully occupied with its own snifter of dark amber liquid . " Breathlessly , " Edmund admitted on a smile . His golden hair shone in the candlelight , his blue eyes danced in obvious amusement . " Damned dreadful , ai n't it ? " " The hangman 's retreat , " Adam concurred brightly . " Machiavelli 's inner sanctum . Nero 's music room . " " The devil 's den ? " " Yes , " Adam said , taking a sip of brandy . " That , too . Are you sure Lady J did n't have her husband stuffed and mounted in one of the corners ? It 's so dark in here , anything 's possible . Oh , " he added a moment later , " that was tactless . I know you address Lady J as your aunt , but whether it is by marriage or you 're truly her nephew-well , either way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgive me . " " No harm done , I assure you , " Edmund answered , sitting back more comfortably , crossing one leg over the other . " As happenstance would have it , Lady J is mine . I 'm afraid I never met His Lordship . Was he badly oppressed , do you think ? " " Hounded straight into the grave , I 'd imagine , " Adam said , and the two laughed , then settled themselves again , staring into the fire . It was comfortable , sitting there with Edmund , a man who was an interesting conversationalist but also knew when a comfortable silence was preferred . Adam and Edmund had spent a most enjoyable afternoon together , talking of deep things , speaking of nonsense . They seemed to share every interest , every opinion . With most of his friends not in town for the Small Season , Adam had been grateful to have met such a kindred spirit , felt himself lucky to find a friend to lighten his mood , lighten his days . Edmund had delighted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking of his travels , the sights he 'd seen , some of the outrageous characters he 'd met . It was nice to see Geoff smile , to watch him partake in society again , even in this limited way . Everything would be even more pleasant if there had never been a Richard Brimley . Because Adam really liked Edmund Burnell . A few months ago , he would have trusted the man , trusted his own judgment . " It 's a pity your brother had to retire , Daventry , " Edmund said , as if knowing Adam had been thinking about Geoff . " Do his legs pain him ? " Adam frowned as he remembered carrying Geoff down to the carriage , hearing the echo of his brother 's sharp rebuff as he had attempted to insist he and Sherry also return to Grosvenor Square . " No-at least he never complains . Although tonight 's dinner is the first time he 'd been , well , out and about since the accident . It may have been too much for him . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the result is the same , as he ca n't walk until his injuries heal . " Edmund nodded , then rose to fetch the decanter from the small table he 'd set before the fire to warm its contents . Refilling Adam 's snifter , he sat down once more , steepled his fingers , and asked , " It was a fall from a horse , I understand ? " Adam felt the tic begin its work beside his eye and drank deep from the snifter before answering . " No . A curricle accident , " he said as coolly as he could . " A stupid accident , as are most , I suppose . An idiotic challenge , a wet course , a splintered wheel-a ditch . " He looked into the fire , seeing Geoff 's body crumpled , broken , pinned beneath the overturned curricle . The vision shook him , sickened him , so that he took another deep drink of brandy . " There was also the obligatory storm that blows up whenever a loved one has n't returned home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took hours to find Geoff . The longest of my life . " His eyes darkened at another memory , a memory even worse than that of his brother lying unconscious in the mud . It knocked at the doors of his mind , begging to come in , sit down , laugh at him . " Hours , " he repeated , shaking himself back from the brink of that other memory . " He nearly drowned in that damnable ditch . " " I 'm sorry if this conversation hurts you , Daventry , and I can see that it does . But I must ask you . Your brother is such a likable fellow . From what you 've said , he will walk again , wo n't he ? " The brandy was warming Adam , soothing him , yet burning deep in his belly . " If there 's a God , yes .
