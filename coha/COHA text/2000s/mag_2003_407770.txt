PHOTOGRAPHS BY WILLIAM ALBERT ALLARD THE PIAZZA DEL CAMPO IS QUIET , THE EARLY MORNING SUN SLOWLY lighting the storefronts and medieval palaces that line the fan-shaped plaza . The piazza-the heart of Siena-is best known as the location of the Palio , a horse race run twice a year , in July and August , for the glory of the 17 districts or contrade that make up the city . Today the piazza hosts pigeons that perch atop the long-abandoned battlements of the town hall , the piazza 's largest structure . Across the square , three women head toward a coffee shop , walking confidently , their dress simple but stylish . A small group of elderly men , each wearing a jacket fitted to form , the creases of their slacks sharp as knife blades , their shoes polished , amble past me , sharing quick-to-spread gossip . " If we have a chance to stop and talk with friends , we take it , " says Nicoletta Landi , one of the city 's most celebrated tour guides , as both of us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Italian , gossip is second only to religion in order of importance . The better the gossip , the longer we talk and the more coffee we drink . " The people of Siena-a city founded by the Roman emperor Augustus-are warm and friendly , quick to answer a stranger 's question . Otherwise , they calmly go about their business , stopping to chat with friends as if they were the only ones standing in the center of the ancient streets . They speak in low voices in a language many believe is the purest form of Italian . Of all the Italian cities I 've visited , with the exception of Naples , I 've yet to find one as fiercely proud and independent as Siena . Its people disdain the modern , finding comfort in the ways of the time-honored past . Most of its 50,000 citizens will readily tell you of the economic power the city enjoyed between the 12th and 14th centuries . Of the decision made in 1287 to ally with Florence , their northern rival , and to create a ruling body called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years lasted until 1348 , when the Black Death took three-quarters of the city 's population before its venomous dust dissipated . And of the final blow that came in April 1555 , when Siena was starved into surrendering to a Spanish and Florentine force led by Gian Giacomo dei Medici of Florence . The bitterness over that centuries-old treachery still carries with it an aftertaste . Today , Siena is one of the rare beauties of Europe , a medieval city that stubbornly exists within the confines of a modern world . Most homes display one of 17 flags , each distinguished by a different color and animal design and signifying one of Siena 's 17 distinct districts . " Each district is actually a small city hidden inside a larger one , " says Landi . " And if a young woman from one district falls in love with a young man from another district , then the families certainly have something to say about it . " " But what if you fall in love with someone from another city ? " I ask . " Depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Better the young man be from Rome than from Florence . " " Yet Florence does n't seem to feel that way toward Siena , " I counter . " They were the victors , " she replied . " Why should they carry hard feelings ? " " All this because of what happened back in 1555 ? " I ask , leading the way out of the piazza . " A city should retain its history , " Landi replies . " The good and the bad . " SIENA IS BUILT FOR WALKING . I 've been here for three days , along with my wife and son , trying to keep pace with Landi as she leads us through the high ground and low archways of the circular city , the Campo always a short distance away . None of Siena 's streets , many with dancing fountains , are level , and the city sprawls on a series of hills , surrounded by the luscious vistas of the Tuscan countryside . Most of the predominantly Gothic homes and buildings that line the narrow streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each dwelling 's exterior must be maintained in colors regulated by the city-for instance , shutters may only be painted grey , green , or Terra di Siena red ; facades must be ocher , pink , brick red , or marble white . Any deviation requires government permission . I found only one such renegade , painted a garish yellow in jolting contrast to the other elegantly kept residences . While I stopped to stare at it , a middle-aged man stepped alongside me and shook his head with disappointment . " You will forget it tomorrow , " he says . " I have to pass it every day to and from work . I can never forget it . Some people just need to be different . " Siena 's front doors of rich , thick wood freshly painted or sanded are kept polished enough to see a reflection clearly . " How someone decorates the inside of a home is her decision , " Landi tells me , standing in front of a two-story brick house off the Via di Citta . " But what 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first thing a guest sees . It must convey pride and care , because if you put all that effort into a door , imagine how special the inside of the house must be . " We walk past the Monte dei Paschi , the oldest bank in Europe , first established in 1472 . Long open to the public , after the September 11 attacks in the U.S. the bank began limiting access only to customers . " There are people in Spain who will tell you they have the oldest bank , " Gabriele Cioffoletti , the bartender at Rome 's Regina Hotel Baglioni since 1964 and a frequent visitor to Siena , had told me several days earlier . " But they do n't have the documents to prove it . Until they produce those , Siena 's bank remains the oldest . " SIENA IS ONE OF THE RICHEST cities in Italy . Restaurants are crowded year-round and the shops are filled with wonders ( often at bargain prices ) - from oak barrel-aged wine to fine silverware and furniture to exotic meats and cheeses . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1374 . Laws here are followed to the letter . Scooters are parked according to specific times and places . Tour buses do park where the law dictates . There 's virtually no crime and , other than traffic and crowd control , the police seem to have little to do . " In Siena a tour guide is always on call , " says Landi . " Even in the middle of the night . But a policeman can go an entire day without being asked a question or having to answer a phone call . There are times when I wonder why we even have police at all . " The population is among Italy 's best educated , and a first-rate medical school draws students worldwide . " It 's nice to have so many young people among us in Siena , " says Landi as we walk down a steep hill toward the Via delle Campane , " even though most of us believe life does n't really begin until 35 or 40 . But , as with everything else , there 's a price to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a McDonald 's inside the city walls . Some call it progress . We have n't come up with a name for it yet . " My 17-year-old son Nick has joined us , and we enter Basilica Cateriniana di San Domenico , built in 1226 . In the center of an exquisite chapel is the mummified head of St. Catherine of Siena , one of the patron saints of the city and of all Europe ( a typical unschooled young woman of medieval times , she achieved renown by persuading the pope , in exile in Avignon , to return to Rome ) . In the Middle Ages pilgrims required visual proof that a saint actually existed , so religious relics got wide exposure . Consequently , after St. Catherine died at 33 in 1380 , her torso stayed in Rome , one foot went to Avignon , the other to Venice , while her head and a finger came to Siena . Nick and I light a candle , and kneel before the saint 's head . " Nice way to treat a saint , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and ship her off to anybody who does n't believe she ever lived . " " It 's just the way they did things back then , " I whisper . " At least we know this is really her head , as gross as that may be , " he says . " But how do the people in Venice and France know those are really her feet ? " " Whose else would they be ? " " Could be anybody 's , " he says . " We 'll talk about it at dinner , " I say . That night , we eat at the Grotta di S. Caterina , considered by the locals to be Siena 's finest restaurant . There , we have the five-course special , designed by chef Pierino Fagnani and served with silent pride by his assistant , Libero Terosi . As with all restaurants in Siena , the prices are reasonable and the food the perfect offering of regional specialties . If you 're looking for low-calorie , low-fat fare or fresh fish , Siena will disappoint . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortadella , along with a mixed green salad or a platter of artichokes and assorted sliced cheeses . A typical second course : pasta cooked in a wild boar or wild rabbit sauce , each heavy and hearty . The best main dish is a grilled assortment of local meats-steak , boar , pig , rabbit , and calf . And wine ? The red Brunello is hard to resist , and the locals are n't shy about drinking it . Siena 's waiters work behind a benign shield of indifference . They stand back , content to allow a visitor the time to navigate a menu written only in Italian . Then , with the timing of a great performer , they move to the table and turn up the charm , showing off their knowledge of wine and cuisine . Only after the meal and wine are ordered does the waiter offer a grateful bow and a warm smile . " You have to accept the people of Siena as they are , " my cousin Giancarlo Lo Manto tells me by phone from his home in Florence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride mixed with the desire to do a good job leaves little room for humor . " ON MY LAST NIGHT IN SIENA I go for a walk while my wife and son watch an episode of Columbo in Italian back at the hotel . The narrow streets and steep steps are silent and empty ; the towers that dominate the landscape cast wide shadows against the glare of the street lights and the glow of a full moon . The stores are shuttered and the restaurants are taking their final orders . In the distance , a young couple walks hand in hand , the woman 's head leaning against the man 's shoulder , the heels of their shoes clicking against the red brick and stones that had once been walked on by kings and trampled over by conquerors . I move past the quiet Museo dell ' Opera del Duomo and stop in front of an outdoor cafe where an elderly man rests chairs atop tables , eager for his long day to end . " You have time for one more customer ? " I ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrug . " Does that customer want food or drink ? " " A Fernet-Branca , " I say . " With ice . " " I 'll make two , " he says , disappearing into the dark bar . " It 's been a busy night . " We sit facing a dark street , the lights from the towers and churches clouded in mist . " It 's so quiet here , " I say . " It 's like we 're the only two people in the entire city . " " That would be true in other places , " he says . " But not in Siena . Here we are never alone , no matter how quiet , no matter how still . We have kept our past and our history alive . It 's all around us , there for us to touch , to see , to feel . " I smile , finish my drink , and stand to pay . " There 's no charge , " the man says as I get ready to leave . " Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope you enjoy them both . " I nod , thank him , and walk away . On that quiet night , Siena is a city at peace , both with itself and with its history . A place neither man nor time could ever damage . Italy 's very own magic kingdom . Sidebar <p>
