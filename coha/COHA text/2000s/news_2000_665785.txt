You spend precious morning minutes putting it on , and another chunk of time taking it off at night  --  day after day after day ... No wonder you want your makeup to deliver even greater benefits Beauty companies have embraced this multitasking approach . Increasing and lipsticks and lipstick boast the same wrinkle-fighting ingredients , double-digit SPF 's and botanical boosters you 've come of expect from skin-care creams , sunscreens , and masks . To find out now well these cosmetic over-achievers actually perform , we combined through the latest offerings and spoke to chemists and skin experts to separate the real deals from the too-good-to-be-true . <p> L : Anti-Aging Makeup THE PROMISE Youth-boosting skin-care ingredients such as retinol , peptides , and antioxidants are popping up in foundations , lipsticks , and blushes , with claims they 'll help minimize wrinkles and brown spots by improving their appearance even after you are no longer wearing the makeup . <p> THE REALITY When makeup is loaded with proven wrinkle-reducing ingredients like retinol and peptides , it can be effective , says Patricia Farris , M.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Medicine in New Orleans . But to see an improvement over time , these ingredients must be present above certain concentrations . For vitamin C , it 's 5 to 10 percent , says Dr. Farris . For retinol , it 's at least 0.1 percent . Two products that have that 0.1 percent : GloMinerals GloCream Blush in Fig ( shown ) or Guava ( $25 each , gloskincare.com ; 5 ) . <p> Beauty companies do n't often tell you these percentages , though you can hedge your bets by checking that active ingredients like vitamins and retinol are higher up on the ingredient list  --  and by choosing creamy formulas over powders . Retinol and vitamin E , for example , are oily materials . " They 're difficult to blend in powder at high levels because they make the particles stick together , " says Perry Romanowski , an independent cosmetics chemist . Instead , try a liquid such as L'Oreal Paris Visible Lift Line-Minimizing &; Tone-Enhancing Makeup ( $14.25 , drugstores ; 3 ) with pro-retinol and SPF 17 . <p> Also look closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminate wrinkles or sun damage , says Brandith Irwin , M.D. , a Seattle dermatologist and author of The Surgery-Free Makeover . Instead , they " minimize the appearance of wrinkles " or " visibly reduce fine lines . " As for those studies showing a reduction in wrinkle depth , dermatologists often credit the moisture in makeup , not the anti-aging ingredients , fordoing most of the heavy lifting . " The quickest way to make a wrinkle look better is to smear moisturizer on it , " Dr. Farris says . Skin is like a sponge , wrinkled and rough when dry , soft and smooth once you add water . Infusing it with hydrators is faster ( and cheaper ) than adding enough retinol or peptides to makeup to smooth skin long-term . <p> BOTTOM LINE Turn-back-the-clock makeup may offer some benefits , but it probably wo n't get you carded at the wine shop . What it can do : soften the look of your wrinkles with light-scattering pigment and moisturizers . Try : Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Plump Perfect Makeup SPF15 ( $39.50 , department stores ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in Blushing Bride ; $10 , avon.com ; 2 ) , and Raw Natural BeautyPrimal Pigments Botanical Lipstick ( shown in Nectar ; $20 , rawbeauty.com ; 1 ) . <p> WHAT 'S NEW Vitamin C in your cosmetics <p> L : Sun Shielders THE PROMISE Foundations , primers , and powders now pack the high SPFs ( think 15-plus ) for filtering out burning UVB rays , plus protection from skin-damaging UVA . Some even include a UVA rating developed in Japan : You 'll see a PA+ , PA++ , or PA+++ ( to indicate the highest level of UVA protection ) . <p> THE REALITY Because the FDA regulates sun-protection claims , dermatologists are more enthusiastic about the efficacy of SPF cosmetics than of anti-aging makeup . So the number on the label truly reflects the level of UVB filters you 'll get . To bolster UVA protection ( the rays that are mostly responsible for skin cancers and skin aging ) , cosmetics often include the minerals zinc and titanium . They form a shield on the skin 's surface , diffusing UV light before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll get even better coverage if your makeup contains both . Try Revlon Age Defying Spa Foundation SPF 18 ( $14 , drugstores ; 4 ) and Prescriptives All Skins Mineral Makeup SPF 15 ( $32.50 , department stores ; 6 ) . Or choose makeup with SPF 30 or up , plus zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide . Try Jane Be Pure Mineral Skin Perfecting Foundation SPF 30 ( $5.49 , drugstores ; 7 ) and Shiseido Sun Protection Liquid Foundation SPF 42 PA+++ ( $33.50 , department stores ; 2 ) . <p> Even the more potent formulas ca n't replace an SPF day cream . " Relying on makeup alone is like taking a boat intended for lagoon fishing out in the ocean , " says Fredric Brandt , M.D. , a dermatologist in New York City and Miami . One reason : Most people do n't apply enough . You need about half a teaspoon for your face and neck to get the required thickness . Mineral-powder foundation , such as Colore-science Suncanny SPF 20 Foundation Brush ( $60 , colorescience.com ; 5 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facial lotion is still recommended . So why bother with SPF makeup ? Sunscreen lotions and sprays alone let some UV light sneak through , and people skimp on application , just as they do with makeup . The best way to stay protected : Double up by layering makeup over a moisturizer containing an SPF of 15 or higher and UVA filters ( Mexoryl , Helioplex , or avobenzone ) . Try Gamier Nutritioniste Ultra-Lift Pro Deep Wrinkle Cream SPF 20 ( $17 , drugstores ; 3 ) or SkinCeuticals Active UV Defense Sunscreen Cream SPF 15 ( $29 , skinceuticals.com ; 1 ) . <p> BOTTOM LINE Ultra-protective makeup is a boon for skin . But think of it as the Robin to your sunscreen 's Batman  --  a dynamic duo stronger together than either is alone . <p> WHAT 'S NEW High-SPF mineral makeup <p> L : Botanical Boosters THE PROMISE Chemical-shunning makeup has hit the big time . From supermarkets to Saks , new products brim with ingredients only ( or mostly ) from nature , not the lab . Many claim skin-nourishing properties that are comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natural ingredients can be good for skin . Plant oils and shea and cocoa butters make fantastic moisturizers , Dr. Brandt says . Aloe and chamomile are soothing . And minerals have become the darlings of new makeup lines for sensitive skin . Just as important as what the natural formulas contain is what they leave out : Ideally , it 's a long list of potential irritants , including synthetic fragrance compounds and dyes that can aggravate sensitive skin , and parabens , which are not as allergenic as once thought , though companies are using both natural and synthetic substitutions instead . Try parabens-free Almay Pure Blends Makeup ( $14 , drugstores ; 2 ) . Some powdered mineral makeup , like Jane Iredale Amazing Base Loose Minerals SPF 20 ( $42 , janeiredaledirect.com ; 5 ) , does n't require a preservative at all . " If the formula does n't contain water , no preservatives are necessary , " Romanowski explains . ( Consider tossing it if moisture gets in , though . ) Natural is n't always synonymous with benefits , however . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wary of products with a lot of plant and flower extracts , " says Dr. Irwin . They may contain various enzymes , proteins , and other compounds that increase the chance of an allergic reaction on the skin . Plant oils , which are made up of relatively simple fatty acids , are gentler on skin . Try Yes to Carrots C Me Shine Lip Gloss ( shown in Flirty Pink ; $6.49 , Walgreens ; 3 ) with castor-seed oil , or SukiColor Rich Pigment Mascara ( $34 , sukicolor.com ; 1 ) with sunflower-seed oil . <p> Irritants may be lurking in mineral makeup , too . That 's because not all brands are pure minerals . A quick scan of the ingredients may turn up parabens and other fillers . One without them : Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Talc-Free 100% Mineral BronzeBrightener ( $14 , drugstores ; 4 ) . Also be skeptical of claims made about natural antioxidants . Manufacturers may not use the most effective form . Just because vitamin C , for example , fights free radicals does n't mean orange juice or orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt you , but do n't pay extra for it , " Dr. Irwin says . <p> BOTTOM LINE You 'll get the best green bang for your buck if the top half of the ingredient list contains naturals . But do n't buy into the good-for-you claims if you also find a laundry list of potential irritants . <p> WHAT 'S NEW Makeup goes green with plants <p> By Beth Janes <p>
