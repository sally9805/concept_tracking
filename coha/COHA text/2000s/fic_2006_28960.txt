The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner By Andrea Smith Random House Andrea Smith ONE Canaan Creek , 1985 From the back porch , Bonnie watched Thora Dean in the flowery bramble behind the house . In a wide straw hat , Thora plucked blackberries , each the size of a silver dollar , and set them in her basket . Over the years , the bramble had become one of Thora 's favorite places . At the height of the season , the area was peaceful , fragrant , and the prickly shrubs that extended well into the woods were overcome with plump , dark berries . " Thora , " Bonnie called . " I 'm fixin ' to set breakfast on the table . " " I 'll be along , " she yelled back . Bonnie could smell the impending rain . Like most quick showers during a South Carolina summer , the coming storm might be just enough to cool the day off . Bonnie entered the house and the screen door slapped shut behind her . She used a moist paper towel , tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweat from her face . Sometimes she could n't tell if it was the actual heat that made her stop and take a breath , or her own " private summer . " Perhaps a bit of both . She lifted a platter of pancakes from the stove and lay it on the table , set for two . Then Bonnie glanced at the wall clock above the sink . She decided to place an extra plate and coffee cup . Most mornings , Tally , the mailman , stopped in for a quick cup before he ended hisrun . " Thora , " Bonnie yelled out of the screen door . " Damn it to hell , " Thora hollered as she made her way across the back lawn . " I say I 'm on my way , then I 'm on my way ! " She hooked the basket of berries on her forearm and took the porch steps one at a time . Her large chest , once the highlight of a voluptuous body , now seemed to drag her down , and when she entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the pancakes already ? " she asked . " That 's what I been tryin ' to say , " Bonnie replied . " I told you that . " " I told you so , I told you so ! Girl , you startin ' to sound like an old woman . " " That 's ' cause I am an old woman . . . and I hate to tell you , dear . . . " Bonnie let the rest of her sentence dangle conspicuously in the air . Thora hung her hat on the hook beside the door . A thin , black ponytail trailed down her back and a few silvery hairs sprung from her temples . Thora 's dark face was misted with sweat but her lipstick remained perfect . Even working in the bramble on a hot summer morning , Thora Dean refused to leave the house without at least applying a subtle coat of Positively Plum . Thora quickly rinsed the berries in a colander , then dried her purple-stained hands on the dish towel . The two women sat , clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said grace . Her mumbled devotion sounded like a familiar song , ending with " . . . our dear Father , amen . " " Wildflowers ' bout to take over the bushes out there , " Thora said , pulling two pancakes onto her plate . " I can think of worser things growing . " Thora stirred a bit of cream into her coffee . " Weeds , weeds , and mo ' weeds , " she grumbled . " Them damn Johnny Jump-ups fin to choke the life outta the blackberry roots . " " Why you so contrary this mo'nin ' ? You up again last night ? " Thora nodded . " Horace come to me . " Bonnie stopped pouring maple syrup and looked at her old friend . " Somewhere ' round two a.m. there he was a-standing in the bathroom door . Standing there jes ' like any other mo'nin ' . He was holdin ' one them big ole pipe wrenches and wearin ' his smock like he was headin ' fo ' a job . All he said this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey . Ca n't skimp on this one . ' Then he left . " Bonnie looked at Thora curiously . " What in the world that mean ? " " Beats me . " Bonnie said , " He was a lot less talkative in this dream . " " Wad n't no damn dream , and you know it . " Bonnie tossed her hand . " You and all that foolishness . All I need right now is to start believin ' in haints and things . " They heard a truck pull up outside , then a door slammed shut . Thora 's eyes shot up to the wall clock , then she dabbed her mouth with a paper napkin . " Tally late again this mo'nin ' , " she said . " Only twenty minutes . " " This time . " " How often do we git our mail late ? " Bonnie always defended Tally when he was running behind on his deliveries . " Fo ' fact , I cai n't remember the man takin ' mo ' than a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mail . " " Five years , " Thora corrected . " And Tally took plenty a days off . We jes ' ai n't got our mail ' til he come back . " " Well , he do alright fo ' me . " Blackberry Corner was the last stop on his route and she recognized that Tally was one of only two mail carriers for the Canaan Creek Post Office , so he was responsible for seven miles ' worth of mail deliveries every day . Sometimes when Bucky Elworth 's arthritis acted up , Tally would take on the additional shift and deliver to the entire tri-county area of Pertwell , Manstone and Canaan Creek , affectionately called the " Three Sisters . " The gate squeaked open in the front yard . " Hey there , Tally , " Thora called out . " Hope you got my check . " " And my Spiegel catalogue , " Bonnie put in . " Seem like I had every catalogue the Lord ever made in my bag today . " Tally 's sack brushed the foyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set it by the kitchen door , then placed a bunch of letters into Thora 's waiting hands . " It 's still summer , " he carped , " and here I got all these dern fall catalogues . " In the years that Tally had worked this route , the color of his uniform had changed from navy to light blue to khaki . His hat , once a boller , was now a stiff-rimmed cap . But one thing that never changed was that his uniform had always been too tight , causing his stomach to spill over his belt . " Set on down and ha ' yo'self some breakfast , " Bonnie said . " You know I ai n't got no time to sit , " Tally said , even as he shifted a couple of pancakes from the platter onto his waiting plate and eased himself into the chair across from Thora . " I 'm doin ' the Manstone run after this . " " Still takin ' on extra shifts ? " Bonnie asked . " Sockin ' my pennies away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lil ' piece a land out there in Taliliga . " " Taliliga , " Bonnie said with surprise . She set a cup of hot coffee in front of him . " Fo'teen acres , " Tally added . " Pretty land . And cheap as sin . " " ' Course it 's cheap , " Thora put in . " Ai n't nothin ' in Taliliga but sticks and mosquitoes . . . and some of the countriest folk God ever made . " " Thora , " Bonnie scolded . " She ai n't lyin ' , Bonnie , " Tally said . " But , I 'm sho ' Columbus men said the same thing when they landed in the New World . " " You mean befo ' they commenced to whuppin ' on them po ' Indians , " Thora argued . " Got to beat some eggs in order to make an omelet , " he shot back . Tally and Thora were always locking horns . And as much as Thora complained about the man , Bonnie was beginning to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you plan on movin ' into this new house by yo'self , " Thora asked . " Lessen you got some ideas , " Tally said . As usual , Thora ignored his foolery . She returned to sorting the mail and finally separated a mustard-colored , government-sealed envelope from the rest of the pack . Beneath it was a small white envelope with a handwritten address . " My mama always said , " Tally went on , " that it 's bad luck fo ' a single man to move into a house by hisself . Say the house swallow ' im up . Say it turn ' im into a man no woman can ever live wit ' . " " Why you doin ' it , then ? " Thora asked . " ' Cause Mama 's dead and I 'm tired of livin ' at Coreen 's place . A man of fifty-such-in-such should n't be livin ' at no roomin ' house . " " You mean sixty-such-in-such , " Thora mumbled . She took a pair of gold-framed glasses from her pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the return address on the back of the envelope . " What you got there ? " Bonnie asked . " Just say , ' Bonnie Wilder , Canaan Creek , South Carolina . ' " " Meant to mention that one , Bonnie , " Tally said . " At the station , we calls it a Christmas letter . Like them letters addressed to ' Santa Claus , North Pole . ' " Thora handed Bonnie the envelope and her glasses . She opened the seal and unfolded a letter written on plain white paper . Her eyes skimmed it quickly , a smile spreading across her face . " It 's from one of our children . " " Gal or boy ? " Thora asked . " Gal named Augusta Randall , " Bonnie answered . " She a grown woman now . They 's all grown now . " " If that do n't make me feel old , " Thora mumbled . Tally refilled his coffee cup at the stove . " Them kids must live all over the place . " " One boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , live right here in the Three Sisters . Work as a porter for the Penn-Eastern Railroad . Outta the blue , he come by one day jes ' to say hello . " " And remember the letter we got from that gal live all the way in Barcelona , Spain , " Thora said proudly . " Yep , she some kinda translator . " " Must be good to know when the babies grow up and do well , " Tally said . " Lotta folk woulda look the other way . Woulda took them babies right on over to the county home . " " I do n't know , " Bonnie said modestly . " Heroes , " Tally insisted , " all two of you ! " " A few mo ' than two , " Thora put in . " And I would n't call us no heroes , " Bonnie said . " Bonnie 's right , " Thora said . " ' Cause anybody with the love of Jesus woulda done the same damn thing ! " Tally nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee . Bonnie looked over the top of her glasses . " There 's a time fo ' things to happen , " she said thoughtfully , " and a time fo ' things to end . " " What this Augusta Randall have to say ? " Thora asked , trying to change the subject . " ' Dear Miss Wilder , ' " she read , " ' I hope this letter finds you well and in God 's favor . . . ' " " Mean she hope you still alive , " Thora said . Bonnie went on reading . " ' You do n't know me , as I 've spent most of my life in New Jersey , but I was born in the Three Sisters . My family name was Porter . ' Augusta Porter , " Bonnie said . " Y'all recollect any folks named Porter ? " " Maisy Porter , " Thora answered . " Lived out by the Main Street . But she was a white woman . " " ' My mama 's name was Evelyn and my daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four and that 's when Mama and I moved to New Jersey . I work as a schoolteacher now-I teach third grade in a town called Montclair . ' Ai n't that nice , " Bonnie said . " ' My husband , Joseph , is also a teacher at a college here , and we 're about to have our first child . ' Lovely , " Bonnie whispered almost to herself . " ' I wanted to thank you , Miss Bonnie . I 've had a wonderful life and I know that it was you and the other ladies who started me on my way . ' " " Heros , " Tally insisted . " No , no , sheros ! " " You jes ' crazy , Tally . " Bonnie chuckled . Then she went on reading . " ' The second reason I 'm writing is a bit more complicated . ' " " Ai n't it always , " Tally grunted . " ' My mama , Evelyn , went to her glory just a year ago . I ca n't tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's gone , and now that I 'm about to be a mama myself , I 'm hoping to find out who my real mother is . ' " " Lot of folks doin ' that now , " Tally said , wiping his mouth . " I see on that Geraldo show where all these people , young and old , is runnin ' ' round tryin ' to find out who they is and where they come from . " " ' I miscarried a child two years ago and the doctor says that I should stay off my feet , so I 've had a lot of time to sit and wonder . I hope you do n't mind if I call you . . . maybe you can tell me what you remember . ' Lord , I cai n't recall what my name is sometimes , " Bonnie said . " And ne'er a one of us ever kept no records . " " Maybe this gal ought a go on that Geraldo show , " Tally joked . Thora rolled her eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan na be found or not ! " Tally finished his coffee in one gulp . " Bonnie , " he said , rising , " breakfast was delicious . . . as usual . Hate to eat and run . . . " " Run ? " Thora said . " All them pancakes you scoffed down , man , you be lucky if you can walk . " " Always a pleasure to see you too , Thora Dean , " Tally said , lifting his sack . At the kitchen door , he turned back . " Say there , Thora . . . " he began . " Umm-hmm , " she replied without looking up from a Rich 's catalogue . " I hear-tell you like them picture shows . . . " " I do , " she replied . Tally 's sack knocked against the coatrack . " They 's got a new one there at the Regal , " he said . " The Color Purple . " " Seen it . " He thought a second . " In Manstone , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number fo ' . . . or maybe that 's number five . . . " " Seen it , " she said . " And before you go on , " she added , " I done seen every movie playin ' in all the Three Sisters . " He rubbed the new growth on his chin . " Did n't know you had such an active social life , " he said . " Well . . . y'all have a good day , then . " " You too , Tally . &; Continues ...
