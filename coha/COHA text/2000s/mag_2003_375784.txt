Comedian CHRIS ROCK , shown here dressed as rapper Missy Elliott , will be host of MTV 's 2003 Video Music Awards on Aug. 28 <P> You already hosted the VMAs a couple of times . Why do it again ? <P> It 's one of these gigs where you get in touch with the " youth culture , " so you get to be hip by association . " Hey , I 'm next to 50 Cent ! " <P> Are there any ground rules ? <P> I do n't take ground-rule gigs . I understand you ca n't curse , you know ? After that , I really do n't want to hear it . My ground rules are , I wo n't curse , and I wo n't waste your money . <P> Is it too soon to start doing Kobe material ? <P> It 's going to be hard not to at least bring it up . Then again , it 's got nothing to do with music . And there 's a rape involved , which really is , you know  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to wear ? <P> I do n't know too many comedians who are funny enough to worry about their clothes . Show me a guy worried about his clothes , I 'll show you a bad show getting ready to happen . <P> Does it actually help to look sort of dorky ? <P> It helps . Cool is the enemy of funny . <P> Do you memorize all those jokes ? <P> I do n't use prompters . I use prompters for the intro , but because some of this stuff is  --  I do n't want to say mean  --  but edgy , I really do n't put it on the prompter . It prevents record-company people from complaining ahead of time . You do n't want Tommy Mottola screaming at you .
