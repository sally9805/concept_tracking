Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft gives us an excuse to consider our next major art form-games // ANGELINA JOLIE IS N'T my idea of Lara Croft , but is Jolie anyone 's idea of anything ? In her video-game incarnation , Tomb Raider 's lady explorer makes Barbie dolls look documentary , from her cutlery gains and distinctively high-hocked walk to a pair of Brockoviches that would n't look out of place if hung on a Calder mobile . But the actress who 's playing her on the big screen this summer just proves that three dimensions are no guarantee of increased plausibility . The key to Lara 's prurient appeal is that she 's so eerily demure , blending the derring-do of Victorian adventure tales with the manners of Victorian porn . As the world knows , decorum is n't Jolie 's strong suit-and how will we be able to feel like voyeurs when we 're watching an exhibitionist ? The obvious drawback to putting this heroine on film , however , is that watching will be all we can do . If only because the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it one ? ) from PlayStation to multiplex is sure to make a bigger splash than either Super Mario Bros. - starring Bob Hoskins , next to whom Michael Caine 's taste in scripts suddenly seemed discriminating-or Street Fighter , which went a long way toward changing JeanClaude Van Damme 's moniker to JeanClaude Oh Darn . But the built-in hitch of movies based on video games is that they ca n't muster an equivalent to their source material 's essential feature-you know , that they 're games . Doh ! Up till now , the big-screen adaptations of popular arcade titles have n't just insulted our intelligence . As the lowest form of brand-name filmmaking , they 've insuited our stupidity . But Hollywood 's blithe assumption that these movies ' source material is beneath contempt seems increasingly misplaced , and not only because gaming now takes more of Americans ' leisure cash ( and time ) than Hollywood 's annual output does . If people come out of Tomb Raider saying , " The game 's better , " they wo n't just mean that it 's more fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will mean , but " more fun " can cover a whole slew of pleasures-like more involving , more inventive , and more challenging , along with just plain livelier . All of which , in my math , adds up to a more-how to put this ? - aesthetically rewarding experience , and the relatively venerable game in question is n't even state-of-the-art . So far as I know , nobody has speculated on how our perception of paintings might be different if we could clamber into the Mona Lisa and stroll around until we spotted what was making her smile-and then , having found the shotgun Leonardo had hidden , blasted away until we got rid of it With video games now poised on the cusp between pastime and art form , however-a transition many garners would probably claim took place a decade ago-everything but the shotgun may not stay a joke much longer . If games have a ways to go yet before they get to da Vinci , their ability to turn viewers into the causal agents-translation : players-that other media let us be only in our dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any innovation since film itself . Maybe Metal Gear Solid is no threat to Scorsese , but it 's sure a great argument for Ah-nold to get on with turning politico . With movie magic itself now relying on the same CGI technology as today 's home-console thrill rides , even action flicks that are n't based on video games have a certain coals  --  to-Newcastle conceptual redundancy . In Tomb Raider 's case-unless director Simon West has something more up his sleeve than his accountant 's pager number , which I doubt-about all we can reasonably hope for is that the movie will be an acceptable Indiana Jones knockoff . But that 's bringing coals to Newcastle in spades , since the game started out as an Indy imitation blatant enough that fear of lawsuits was reportedly what prompted the genius stroke of changing the protagonist 's gender . By now , even that is n't a novelty . The girlpower thrills of martial-arts heroines able to unload whupass by the six-pack have gone from being a cultural epiphany to the millennium 's first cliche , something TV 's Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dork whenever the plot flags . Then again , Dark Angel might make a very good video game , since that 's what it already is in every respect but the crucial one . After all , it is n't because Lara Croft is female that nobody thinks of her as a Raiders of the Lost Ark clone . It 's because when she makes a splash on a game console , whether she sinks or swims is up to us-and not just our sympathies but our skill . This relationship can provoke interesting feelings , and I should know . When I 'm at the control pad , she drowns every time . I 'll take Metal Gear 's Snake over Lara any day , less because he does better by me than because I can do better by him . One reason I 've never been into Tomb Raider is that I 've just never gotten the hang of guiding Lara 's movements , which strike me as too volatile and too arbitrarily restricted at once , and I 'm all thumbs whenever she ends up underwater . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just mash buttons at random while that blue breath graph gets shorter , until she finally kicks the bucket with a prim but accusing sigh that fills me with remorse for being so ineffectual-not to mention irritation at her for getting us into this mess . Right , so maybe Ill improve . The point is that while a movie can duplicate the annoyance , it ca n't simulate the sense of responsibility . Or , indeed , guilt-the unsettling emotion cited by bright young Brit author and gaming addict Steven Poole , in his invaluable book , Trigger Happy , as an example of the unprecedented responses that interactive media , as opposed to the traditional kind , have the power to induce . Once rescuing a princess in a castle is our job rather than Errol Flynn 's , failure is obviously going to make us feel responsible for her doom with a vividness that narratives we 're outside of ca n't match . Unlike Errol , though , we can always try again , trivializing any emotional investment in advance . As Poole suggests , video games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the story line , although he acknowledges that reconciling this with playability would be a designer 's nightmare . What makes Poole 's excitement about games so illuminating is that he 's practically the first writer to champion their artistic virtues , since even positive game criticism seldom ventures past the kind of consumer-guide blurbing that presumes an enthusiasm too unreflective to need rationales . As a result , it 's as if gaming has conquered the world without ever being taken seriously-except , of course , by the fulminating op-ed Luddites ready to blame its alarming popularity for our desensitized society 's ills . Then again , if Silent Scope let its players blow holes in atheists and the undeserving poor , William Bennett might be hauling his well-stuffed shirt to the arcade too often to ever sully a best-seller list again . Since the fulminators usually claim to be bigpicture thinkers , you wonder how come they do n't seem aware that every new entertainment technology since Edison-hell , Gutenberg-has provoked similar jeremiads . Their ancestors uttered the same dire warnings about the pernicious effects of novel-reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducements to immorality when ragtime was in flower , and about film 's wickedness when Clara Bow was the It Girl . I know some people are honestly troubled by the vicarious mayhem at our kiddies ' fingertips , and I 've had qualms myself . But the larger argument is foolish . Inducing moods and feelings unrelated to lived experience is pretty much the basic business of art , and any new means of achieving this holds promise . Even an enthusiast like Poole is well aware that video games are as yet restricted to arousing fairly primitive emotions : to wit , " fear and triumph . " When I 'm playing Syphon Filter , though , even those basic stimuli have intriguing gradations , with fear including everything from the geopolitical paranoia that so many games ' story lines treat as a gimmeglibly , needless to say , but evocatively for all that-to the self-pity I succumb to as my poor proxy trots around in the CGI rain , getting tiresomely killed again and again as I hunt for a flak jacket . As for triumph , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEAD SHOT is of a different order from the cerebral delight of unriddling the latest environmental maze that 's testing my ingenuity-the sensation that a good game can give you of completing a crossword puzzle under fire . As games develop , they 're almost bound to grow more complex emotionally as well as digitally , with richer characterizations , more suggestive interactive contingencies , and so on . Even now , if only to give the hero a defensible casus belli , some designers have started emphasizing the poignancy of those he 's got to save and/or avenge-wretched urchins , cruelly treated victims of tyranny or mad science , and winsome princesses to agitate our inner Errol . As manipulation goes , this is pretty crude stuff , and the Zone of the Enders gambit of making our stand-in a dewy-eyed waif who hates killing-but predictably learns he must-is hilariously disingenuous to boot . But we 're probably not that far from the first video game that makes people cry , and making them laugh more would n't hurt , either . The best video-game joke I know of is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's health but steadies his aim . It 's a fun touch that also suggests the type of subjective ( i.e. , psychologically revealing ) choice  --  the personality quiz as dramatic device-that games have barely begun to explore . Right now , though , it 's my impression that the medium is in a somewhat decadent phase , albeit one I do n't expect will be more than a detour . In the PlayStation 2 era , designers are so entranced with all the cinematic marvels they can beguile us with that letting us get in on the action sometimes seems like an afterthought . A wizard like Hideo Kojima-the medium 's first marquee-name auteur-is brilliant at devising entertaining game play . But he and his collaborators are also fiends for painting with light , and I suspect that it 's a struggle for him to keep those two gifts complementary . The uniqueness of video games , however , is that even the best designers ' talents are ultimately dependent on ours . No matter how fluid a game 's visual dynamics are , it 's still going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deft with the controls . That 's why our participation always has an aesthetic dimension as well as a sporting one . If the culturati are n't yet paying much attention , they should , because video games formalize a connection between creators and consumers whose attainability has obsessed practitioners of both high and low culture for a century . One irony of how put off many people are by postmodernism 's experiments is that the intent has often been to engage them instead-to create new terms of involvement , alter the relationship . And the basic model for this has been-c'mon , guess  --  games , in works that not only use them as metaphors but try to emulate how they function . Literary examples range from Julio CortAzar 's Hopscotch to the link-and-bobolinking novels of modernism 's most famous chess nut this side of Marcel Duchamp , and Poole is way ahead of me : " It is hardly surprising , though obscurely disappointing , that no one has tried to make a video game out of Nabokov 's Pale Fire . " Or Sgt. Pepper , whose labyrinth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play amateur art detective . It 's a standard argument that pop culture is a collaboration to which the audience contributes-that even the Beatles could n't have become " the Beatles " without the wealth of meaning we invested in them . Similarly , while Hollywood provided the raw materials , the mythology of movies-their iconic folklore  --  was largely the audience 's invention . Not until sacks of fan mail came in for then  --  anonymous Mary Pickford did the studios even learn that there was such as thing as movie stars ; in the same way , Lara Croft 's emergence as a fetish object flabbergasted even her designers . At this level , the elitist view of the mass audience as sheep was always a canard ; it also clearly does n't apply to video games , whose nature precludes passive consumption . Not only did we turn Lara into " Lara , " we reinvent her every time we plug in the memory card to try our luck again . However much Simon West 's career is an argument to the contrary , not many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's worth recalling how Orson Welles , who certainly thought so , too , described movie technology as " the best electric-train set a boy ever had . " If nothing else , video games are the best electric-train set the audience has ever had , and the wonderful thing is that we do n't know if their future Orsons will be creating games or just playing them . <p>
