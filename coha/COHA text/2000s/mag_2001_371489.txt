There comes a terrible moment to many souls , " George Eliot wrote in Daniel Deronda , " when the great movements of the world , the larger destinies of mankind , which have lain aloof in newspapers and other neglected reading , enter like an earthquake into their lives .

For many years  --  12 since the toppling of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet threat ; 27 since Watergate , depending on how one is counting  --  the country has been living outside history . By this I mean living not only with little regard for the larger destinies of mankind but also outside the stories , lessons and issues that locate a people within significant patterns of human thought . Now a group of savage zealots has flung us back into history , and however unjust the impetus , we could make use of the experience . <P> Observers have been lamenting that had the country only been more alert to world conditions ( Islam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface nonsense ( O.J. , Elian Gonzalez , Monica , Gary Condit ) , we might have avoided our current troubles .

It came into being when the burden of the past had already grown too heavy for 18th century Europe , so it has always been assumed that the country is uncomfortable with history . In fact , however , until recently , America has lived happily with the past  --  ours and the world 's . How could we not ?
