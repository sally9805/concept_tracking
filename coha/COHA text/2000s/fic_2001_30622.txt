Chapter One : Happy Birthday , Summer It seemed as if a rainbow had burst over our house and grounds . I knew that Daddy had been secretly planning some surprises , but I was not prepared for all that he had done . The moment the morning sun nudged my eyes open , I heard the gentle tinkling notes of " Happy Birthday to You . " With sleepy eyes I gazed at a precious and dazzling merry-go-round spinning a menagerie of animals around a ballerina who danced at its center . " I hope you always wake with a smile like that , Summer , " Daddy said . I looked up and saw Daddy standing there . His face was glowing almost as much as mine . I had his turquoise eyes , but Mommy 's ebony hair and a complexion a few shades lighter so anyone could see that I had also clearly inherited Daddy 's freckles , especially at the crests of my cheeks . " Happy birthday , sweetheart , " he said and leaned over to kiss me on the cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my bed . For a moment she looked so distant , almost as though she was on the outside of a great glass bubble set around me . I knew she was having one of those Evil Eye thoughts , those fears that whenever she was too happy , something terrible would happen . She seemed to realize it herself and brightened quickly into a smile . I rose to hug her . " What were the two of you doing ? " I cried as the merry-go-round continued . " Sitting here waiting for me to wake up ? How long have you been here ? " " We were watching you all night , " Daddy joked . " We took turns , did n't we , Rain ? " " Practically , " Mommy said . " Your crazy father has been acting as if this was more his birthday than yours . " She jokingly put on a look of disapproval . " More and more these days , he acts like a sixteen-year-old . " " You never lose the child within you entirely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out candles on my ninetieth birthday and unwrap presents . Do n't forget to arrange for that , you two , " he ordered , sounding like it was just around the corner . Mommy shook her head and smiled at me as if the two of us were allies forced to tolerate another foolish man . Daddy could never be a foolish man to me , never , ever , I thought . " It 's a beautiful merry-go-round , " I said as it stopped . " That , " my mother said , " is not even the tip of the iceberg . Look out the window , " she urged me . My room overlooked the lake . Grandmother Megan told me it had once been her room , and Mommy said she used it when she had first arrived . Now , she and Daddy used what was Grandmother Hudson 's room , only they had changed the decor and replaced all the furniture . The bathroom had been updated to provide for Mommy 's special needs . In the beginning Mommy did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt an obligation to Grandmother Hudson 's memory to keep it close to how it had been , but in time rugs wore , walls had to be repainted , fixtures replaced , appliances changed , and Daddy brought in a decorator to give it all what they called a more eclectic style . The hallways still had the spirit of the nineteenth century with some Federal antiques , like a White and Dogswell clock that hung across from a circular mirror of that period . Mommy was very proud of all the antiques left by my Grandmother Hudson . Mommy had loved her very much , so much that I was jealous and wished I had been able to know her , too . Grandfather Hudson 's office was the same as it had always been , but much of the rest of the house  --  the living room , the kitchen , my bedroom and Daddy and Mommy 's  --  had been modernized with lighter colors and softer fabrics . Recently my parents had redone the maid 's quarters , covering the floor with a thick white shag rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen-size cherry wood one ; this pleased Mrs. Geary very much . After Glenda had married Uncle Roy and she and Harley had moved out of the main house , Mommy and Daddy hired Mrs. Geary through an agency . She was in her early forties at the time and had come from Ireland to live and work in America when she was in her late twenties . Now streaked with gray , her hair had once been almost as red as Daddy 's . She had been working for her distant American relatives who she said treated her as badly as Cinderella 's stepmother treated Cinderella . " There was no respect . Everything I did was simply expected , too . Not an ounce of gratitude ! I was glad to get out of there , " she told me . Daddy said he liked her because she had an inner strength and confidence he thought would make her an asset in a household where the mistress was disabled . Mommy and she took to each other immediately , and by now it was impossible for me to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . She was often a second mother to me , ordering me to dress more warmly or eat better . She even had something to say about where I would go and with whom I would go . A mother hen did n't hover over an egg as much as Mrs. Geary hovered over me as I grew up under both her and Mommy 's wings . " I spent almost as much time and energy as your mother keeping you growing healthy and strong , and I 'm not about to see my investment go sour , " she told me if I complained . She loved to find words and expressions to avoid expressing her true feelings for me . It was as if she believed that the moment you told someone you loved her , you lost her . I would learn that her own early childhood and teenage years were filled with enough loss to make her think this way . Nevertheless , I teased her whenever I could , especially about her endless ongoing romance with Clarence Lynch , the librarian at the municipal library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had been seeing each other socially for as long as I could remember . Once , when I asked her why she had never married him , her reply was , " Why would I want to ruin a perfectly good relationship ? " It confused me , of course , and I ran to Mommy with questions . She simply smiled and said , " Summer , not everyone fits so neatly into the little boxes society has created . As long as they 're happy , why ask them to change ? " In Mommy 's mind , and I now think mine too , happiness and health were two sides of the same coin , the most important and valuable coin . People who were happy had more hope of being healthy ; of course , people who were healthy were happy . Smiles and laughter were the best medications for the illnesses of the spirit . No one illustrated this better than Daddy , I thought . He loved Mommy and me so much and was so happy that anyone could see him and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highly respected physical therapist who had assumed his uncle 's therapy business and then had created a chain of unique health clubs that combined regular exercise with therapeutic programs . They were known as rejuvenation clubs ; their theme was that through exercise and meditation aging could be slowed down and even in some cases reversed . National health and exercise magazines had even featured Daddy in articles . I was very proud of him and so was Mommy . Yes , happiness and health were truly the twin sisters my family had adopted to live beside me . They nurtured wisdom and wove a protective wall around our house . Nothing terrible from the outside could hurt us , I thought . But what I also knew was trouble loomed nearby in Uncle Roy 's sad and dour world , and it also came riding into our fortress in the form of a Trojan horse named Alison , my Aunt Alison . " People who do n't like themselves ca n't like anyone else , " Mommy once told me . " Your aunt Alison hates herself . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel more pity for her than I do anger , and you will , too , " Mommy predicted . Aunt Alison , as well as Grandmother Megan and my stepgrandfather Grant Randolph would all be here today for my birthday party . Now in the morning light , I stood by the window and parted the curtains as Mommy had directed . For a moment I thought I was still dreaming . My mouth hung open . All of the trees below had been strewn with bright colored ribbons . Many branches had balloons tied to them and they were all dancing to the rhythms of the breezes . Tables covered with green and red and yellow paper tablecloths were all set up on the lawn , and a dance floor was being laid out as I watched . There was even a small stage for musicians . Daddy had kept my party arrangements a big secret and had obviously paid people extra to come quietly on the grounds very early in the morning , before the sun was even up , to begin constructing it all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flashlight hanging balloons , " Mommy told me . " I thought it would be more fun to wake up to it than see it happening days before , " he commented from behind . I still had trouble finding my voice . Finally , I shook my head and shrieked with joy . " It 's ... beautiful ! " I rushed into his arms to kiss him and then hugged and kissed Mommy who could n't stop laughing at my excitement . " Is your father crazy or not ? " " NO ! " I cried . " He 's wonderful ! " " You see , " Daddy said , " at least I have one woman in this house who sees sense in the things I do . " " You poor outnumbered man , " Mommy teased . " Well , you should have heard Mrs. Geary mumbling how it was all too much of this or too much of that and how even happy shocks can be damaging to a young , impressionable spirit . " " Do n't make fun of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? It 's everyone else who 's making fun of me . All right . I 've got some small matters to look after , such as the parking arrangements . I do n't want any of Summer 's teenager friends driving their cars over the flowers , " Daddy said and left . Mommy shook her head and smiled after him . Would I ever find anyone I loved as much and who loved me as much as my parents loved each other ? They were living proof that there really was such a thing as soul mates . " You 'd better get yourself dressed and come down to breakfast , " she said turning back to me and starting away . " I 'm too excited to eat , Mommy . " " If you do n't , Mrs. Geary will single-handedly rip every balloon off every tree and pack up the tables and chairs , " she warned . We laughed . I hugged her again . " Happy , happy birthday , Summer . All your birthdays have been special to me because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said softly , " but I know how special this one is for you . " " Thank you , Mommy . " I knew how true that was , how difficult my birth was for her and how they had decided not to try to have any more children and test their good luck . " I 'll see you downstairs , " she said and continued to wheel herself out to the chair elevator that would take her down the stairs and to the wheelchair below . Never in my life had my mother ever stood on her own beside me . Never had we walked side by side or ran together . Never had we gone strolling through department stores or down streets to window-shop . When I was old enough to push her , I thought it was fun . After all , I was a little girl moving my mother along . But somewhere along the way , I turned to watch other mothers and daughters walking through malls , and I looked at Mommy 's face and saw the longing and the sadness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was that what growing older meant ? I wondered . Losing all your illusions ? If that was so , why were any of us so happy and so willing to blow out the candles ? Mrs. Geary milled about the breakfast table longer than she had to , studying me eat as if my consumption of food was part of some important experiment . " It 's a big day , " she preached when I complained about being given too much . " Big days require bigger fortification . I know what 's going to happen out there after the festivities start . You wo n't eat a thing and you 'll be going , going , going  --  draining and draining that wisp of a willow of a body of yours . That 's when sickness comes knocking on the door anticipating a big fat welcome . " Mommy looked down at her dish of grapefruit slices , hiding her smile . " I 'm not a wisp of a willow , " I protested . After all , I was five feet four and nearly one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a figure like hers once was , although I did n't need to be told . I saw the pictures of her when she was in acting school in London . In all of the photographs , she looked like someone just caught the moment after a wonderful new experience or sight . Her face glowed . There was no better compliment for me than to be compared to Mommy . Mrs. Geary always came in the backdoor with her flatteries , especially about my looks and figure . " Nature plays a trick on young girls , " she informed me . " Before you have a woman 's mind , you get a woman 's body . It 's like putting a diamond necklace around the neck of a four-year-old girl . She has no idea why everyone , especially grownups , are staring at her and she does n't know yet how to wear it or carry it . " " Young people are different today , " I insisted when she made these speeches at me . " We 're far more sophisticated than young people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she cried , slapping her hand over her forehead . It was her favorite dramatic gesture . I actually heard the sharp crack of her palm on her skin . " More sophisticated ? You have more teenage pregnancies , more children in trouble with drugs , more car accidents , more runaways . " When I was your age , the only pregnant girl in the village was a girl raped by her idiot stepbrother . " " Mommy ! " I 'd moan in desperation . " She 's only trying to give you good advice , honey , " Mommy said , but she gave Mrs. Geary a look that said , " Enough . " " I 'll eat at my party , " I promised . " Daddy 's having them make all my favorite things . " That was a mistake . I knew it the moment the words slipped past my lips . Daddy had hired caterers even though Mrs. Geary said she would prepare all the food . He insisted it was an unfair burden to place on her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my birthday was a special pleasure for her . In the end she was given the responsibility for the birthday cake . She grunted at my statement and shook her head . Occasionally , Mrs. Geary would go to a stylist to have her hair cut and shaped , but most of the time , she wore it pinned back in a severe bun . For my party , however , she had surprised us all by having it cut and trimmed in a French style . She had pretty green eyes and a small nose and mouth but a chin that disappeared too quickly . At five feet seven , she was somewhat portly with heavy arms and a robust bosom . She did have a very soft complexion with not even a sign of an impending wrinkle , something she ascribed to keeping makeup and rough soap off her skin . " Manufactured food , " she muttered with disdain . " It 'll have a mass-produced taste . " " Now , Mrs. Geary , " Mommy gently chastised . " You know it 's not manufactured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip , shook her head and went into the kitchen . Mommy smiled at me and said Mrs. Geary would be fine . I gobbled down the remainder of my breakfast , too excited to sit a moment longer . Daddy was outside working with the grounds people to be sure everything was set up the way he wanted it to be . A little more than two dozen of my girlfriends from the Dogwood School for Girls and almost twenty boys from our sister school , Sweet William , would be attending as well as some of my teachers and , of course , my family and Mrs. Geary 's Mr. Lynch . I did n't think of myself as going steady with anyone , but I was seeing Chase Taylor more than anyone else . I had gone on dates with him the last four weekends in a row , and it only took two consecutive dates with the same boy for the girls in my school to have someone practically engaged . I knew almost all my girlfriends envied me . Chase was handsome in a classic way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes that could have been the inspiration for the blue sky on a perfect spring day . Daddy approved of him because he was very athletic , six feet two with what Daddy called football shoulders and a swimmer 's waist . The truth was he played halfback on the football team and was the record holder for Sweet William 's freestyle stroke . He was even thinking of trying out for the Olympics . Chase 's father , Guy Taylor , was one of the area 's most successful attorneys . Their house was almost as big as ours , but their property was n't as nice . Chase told me that his mother coveted ours . " She wants whatever someone else has , " he remarked with a frankness I had n't expected . " So my father works harder and harder . He says it takes an ambitious woman to make a man a success . Are you ambitious , Summer ? " " I do n't think I 'm overly ambitious , " I told him . " It 's not good to be too ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and angels would be gods . ' It 's a quote from some playwright . " He laughed . " How lucky you are to have so wise a maid , " he said . I did n't like the way he said maid and told him firmly that Mrs. Geary was more than a servant in our house . My flare of anger did n't frighten him . He smiled at me and said when I got angry , my eyes were the most exciting jewels he had ever seen . I blushed and he kissed me . I thought , maybe Mrs. Geary was right after all about a young girl burdened with a woman 's body . Feelings went off like alarms through my breasts and down into my thighs . We kissed again and again , each kiss longer and longer ; when we touched our tongues on our most recent date , I had to scream at myself to stop him from pulling down the zipper on my Capri pants . " Do n't you want to ? " he whispered in my ear . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the movies . " Yes , " I said , " and no . " " Teasing me ? " " Teasing myself , " I said . " So let 's stop before I break out in pimples . " He laughed . " Who told you that would happen , Mrs. Geary ? " " No . I made it up , " I said . My sense of humor kept him smiling even though I knew he was frustrated . I was too , but I 'd die before confessing it . If he asks me out again , I 'll know he really cares for me . If not , I thought , I 've been lucky . That was something Mommy taught me . Maybe I was n't such a little girl . Maybe turning sixteen was an understatement . Maybe I was old and wise for my age and all the things Mrs. Geary thought and feared about teenagers today simply did n't apply to me . Maybe I was too arrogant . Maybes hovered everywhere , bouncing about me like the balloons tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramp in front of the house and joined Daddy at the tables . The party was being organized like a camp event . All my guests had been encouraged to bring their bathing suits . Four years ago , Daddy had gotten Uncle Roy to construct a raft which they placed at the center of the lake . We had pedal boats and two kayaks as well as two rowboats . The lake had catfish and bass . However , Uncle Roy complained that fishing in it was like dipping your hook into a goldfish bowl . He said there was no challenge . He was over by the dance floor making sure it was laid down properly . I looked about , expecting to see Harley , too , but he was n't anywhere in sight . " Hi , Uncle Roy , " I called approaching . He turned from the floor where he was kneeling and looked up at me . " Hey , Princess . Happy birthday . " He had been calling me Princess for as long as I could remember . Once , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mommy , I heard him wistfully say , ' She could have been my daughter . ' I had no idea what he had meant at the time , but I knew he meant me . " Thank you , Uncle Roy . " " The way some of you kids dance these days , this thing could splinter up in minutes , " he complained . " I told them I wanted thicker boards . " " It 'll be fine , Uncle Roy , " I assured him . " Umm , " he said skeptically and stood up . When I was younger , Mommy often described how safe and secure she would feel when she walked in the streets of Washington , D.C. , holding Uncle Roy 's hand . It was n't merely his size , his muscles , his large hands that surely swallowed hers in a gulp of fingers that gave her this security . Uncle Roy had an aura of power about him , a danger that came from his sleeping rages , I thought . Although no one could ever be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exception of Mommy and Daddy , of course  --  I always sensed the tension and blood-red anger lurking just below the surface of his every smile , his every word , his every glance and look . Even Chase remarked to me one day that my uncle reminded him of a secret service agent or something . " He looks at me like he expects I might try to assassinate you . He makes me nervous . Man , I would n't want to face him in some dark alley . " " He 's a pussycat , " I said even though I secretly agreed . Mommy told me Uncle Roy was so hard and distrusting because of all the disappointments in his life . I did n't really understand what was the biggest , not yet , but soon enough I would . It would be another gift from time and age , the sort you wished remained wrapped and left under the Christmas tree forever and ever . " Where 's Harley ? " I asked Uncle Roy . He did what he always did whenever Harley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his shoulders as if he was preparing to receive a blow to his head . " Thinking up some crime or misdemeanor , " he replied . " Uncle Roy , " I said smiling . " I do n't know . He did n't come down to breakfast , which is n't unusual . That boy sleeps more than he 's awake and especially sleeps late on weekends . Soon , he wo n't be able to ; soon , he 'll have to work for a living , " he said with relish . Uncle Roy was referring to the fact that Harley , if he passed his finals , would graduate high school this year . He attended the public school . Unfortunately , Harley had been in trouble at school most of his senior-high years . He had been suspended three times and almost expelled for fighting . He had been accused of vandalism and stealing , but that could n't be proven . Harley was far from being an unintelligent boy , and he was even far from being lazy , especially when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He liked to draw , but mostly buildings and bridges . Mrs. Longo , his art teacher , wanted him to pursue a career in architecture , but Harley acted as if that was the same as telling him to pursue becoming a NASA astronaut . Uncle Roy wanted him to enlist in the army , even though his own experience with it had been a failure . He had been court-martialed for going AWOL right after Mommy had fallen from the horse and become a paraplegic . He was in Germany at the time , and he wanted to come right home to her ; but he had violated a leave once before and he was on probation . As a result he received a dishonorable discharge after serving some time in a military prison , which was something Harley threw back at him whenever they got into a bad shouting match . It amazed me how fearless Harley could be whenever he had to face Uncle Roy . Harley was a slim , six-foot tall , dark-complexioned boy with hazel eyes spotted with green . He was n't as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reminded my girlfriends of Kevin Bacon , especially when he smiled with disdain or mockery , which he often did these days . He made fun of all the boys at Sweet William , even Chase , calling them and my girlfriends " mushy kids , " because of their privileged lives , their money , their sports cars and clothes and what he termed their " fluffy thoughts . " He refused to categorize me the same way , however , claiming I was somehow different even though I came from a family with money and attended the same private school . " Why am I different ? " I asked him . " You just are , " he insisted . " Why ? I do everything they do , do n't I ? Few of them have more than I have . " " You just are , " he repeated . " Why ? " " Because I say so , " he finally blurted and walked away from me . He could be the most infuriating boy I knew , and yet ... yet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different eyes , softer eyes , almost childlike and loving eyes . It was all so confusing . That was why I sometimes thought that Mrs. Geary might be right about my being too young for the jewels of womanhood I was blessed with . I looked toward Uncle Roy 's house . I was disappointed . I had hoped Harley would be almost as excited about my party as I was and would be out here by now . " Maybe I 'll go see if he 's at breakfast , " I said . " Do n't waste your time , " Uncle Roy advised . " Hey ! " he screamed at one of the workmen . " You 're putting that in wrong . It 's a tongue and groove . " He walked away and I started for his house . Uncle Roy had built a modest sized two-story home with a light gray siding and Wedgwood blue shutters . It had a good sized front porch because he said he had always wanted a house that had a porch on which he could put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got his wish , but there was n't much world to watch go by here except for the birds , rabbits , deer and occasional fox . With any main highway a good distance away , there were no sounds of traffic either . A car horn was as distant as the honk of a goose going north in summer . Uncle Roy claimed he had always hated city life anyway , and when he had lived in Washington , D.C. , he had gotten so he could walk in the streets and shut out everything . He did look like a man who could pull down shades and curtains and turn his eyes inward to watch his own visions and dreams stream by . Above their front door , Aunt Glenda had hung a bronze crucifix . Once a week , she brought out a stepladder and polished it . The front door was open , but the screen door was closed . I knocked softly on it and then called to her . I could hear her recording of gospel songs which was something she played while she worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me , so I opened the door and stepped into the house . There was always some redolent aroma of something she was cooking or baking . Today , I smelled the bacon she had made for breakfast . I called to her again and then looked into the small living room . She had turned it into a shrine to Latisha . There were pictures of her everywhere , on the mantel above the fireplace as well as on the tables and on the walls . Spaced between them were different religious items , pictures of saints , cathedrals , and icons of Christ . Usually , there were candles lit , although there were none lit this morning . The room itself had a dark decor , furniture made from cherry wood , oak and walnut with a wood floor and area rugs . Mommy and Daddy had bought them a beautiful grandfather clock as a house gift , but no one bothered to wind it and have it run . " Every day now is the same as the one before it , " I once heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock . " Especially for Glenda . Why bother with time ? " There was no one in the dining room so I went down the hallway to the kitchen . The music was playing on a small CD player , but Aunt Glenda was nowhere in sight . However , I saw through the pantry and back door that she was out hanging wash on a clothesline . She liked it better than a dryer because she said the clothing smelled sweeter from the scents of flowers in the air . As usual , she was wearing a faded housecoat and slippers . Her dark brown hair streaked with prematurely gray strands was down to her shoulders , and I could see from the way her mouth moved that she was either talking to herself or saying some prayer to her dead daughter . I retreated to the stairway and listened for some sounds from above to indicate Harley was up . All I heard was the faint drip , drip of a bathroom faucet . " Harley , " I called . " Are you awake ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me smile . " Talking in your sleep again ? " " Yes , " he said . " Do n't wake me up . " " It 's late , Harley . " I started up the stairs . Harley and I had n't grown up exactly like a brother and a sister , but we had spent so many of our young years together , I sometimes thought of him that way . Lately , if I suggested it , it seemed to bother him , so I stopped . " Are you decent ? " I called from the top of the stairway . There was just a short hallway to the right that passed his bedroom and what had been Latisha 's nursery ; there was an equally short hallway to the left that led to Uncle Roy and Aunt Glenda 's bedroom and a bathroom across from that . The windows on both ends were small , and the wood paneling was dark . Even with the bright day , it looked like a tunnel . " Am I decent ? Depends who you ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bedroom doorway . He was still in bed , lying on his stomach , the pillow over his head to block out the sunshine , the blanket down to his waist . I knew from other times that he liked to sleep in his underwear . Harley 's room was half the size of mine . He had a very nice dark maple-wood bed , matching dressers and a desk Uncle Roy had actually built himself that was set to the right of his two bedroom windows . There were papers scattered in a disorganized fashion over it , two books opened and face down and a small pile of notebooks beside that . I could see his line drawings in one of the notebooks . Beside it was a book entitled , American Houses . As usual , his socks were on the floor beside the bed where he had thrown them and where he had dropped his shoes . His jeans were draped over his desk chair and the dark blue shirt he had worn yesterday was crumpled on the top of his dresser . Unlike my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , Harley 's had no posters on its walls . He favored some rock bands , but interestingly enough he really enjoyed softer music , even Barry Manilow , although he never let anyone but me know . It was as if he believed that the moment some of his friends found out he was sensitive , he would lose face or worse yet , be challenged and teased and more vulnerable . " I was hoping you would be up and out by now , or at least at breakfast , " I told him . He did n't turn , but I could see his eyes close as if he had a terrible headache . When he sighed , his entire body lifted and fell . Finally , he turned , dropped his head back to his pillow , put his hands behind his head and looked at me . " Roy , " he began , " came in here and laid down the law last night . The bottom line was that I should be sure to make myself invisible , not annoy anyone and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sound as if a wild animal like me does n't belong in the company of you civilized folks .

" This is my special day , Harley Arnold , and you had better come out . You put on your nicest clothes , too , " I ordered . He laughed . " My nicest clothes are what your mushy kid friends knock around in . " " That 's not so either . I know what you have and what you do n't , " I told him and went right to his closet . " You should learn how to hang up your pants and your shirts properly . Look at this mess . " " Yes , Mother .

" You 've got your Chase Taylor and his mushy buddies . " " You can call Chase a lot of things , Harley , but really , I do n't think he 's mushy . " Harley turned a dark shade of crimson . " Yeah , I guess you would know , " he muttered . " Besides , " I said ignoring his remark , " you know you 're my most important friend , Harley . My birthday party would n't be a birthday party without you . So stop it ! " He looked instantly remorseful , turned and gazed out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like two birthdays are being set up out there . " " Wait until you see all that Daddy has done , " I told him . " The trees have grown balloons . " He laughed . " And Mrs. Geary has made a birthday cake to die for . " He nodded , looked down for a moment and then let his lips fold into a soft smile . " What ? " I asked expecting something that would most likely put me in a pout . " Remember that time when  --  before the guests arrived  --  I put my fingers in your birthday cake and pretended they were your candles and Roy nearly exploded ? I thought his eyes were going to pop out of his head on little springs . " He laughed . " Sometimes I think you do bad things just to get him angry , Harley . " " No . Me ? " " You know you 're hurting your mother too when you get him upset . " His smile disappeared . " She 's beyond being hurt , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see and smell and feel to know when you 're in pain , and she 's beyond that . " " That 's not true , Harley . " " It 's true .
