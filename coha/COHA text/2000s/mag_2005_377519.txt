SHOULD YOU NEED ANOTHER REASON TO AVOID bankruptcy  --  a humbling process often triggered by illness , divorce or job loss  --  look no further than a bill about to be passed by Congress that will make it harder for middle-class families to erase medical , credit-card and other debt . <P> The first big change is a requirement to undergo credit counseling before filing for bankruptcy . That may seem inoffensive , but be warned : over the past few years , horror stories have emerged about credit-counseling agencies that funnel consumers into expensive debt-management plans . Last year the Senate urged the IRS and the Federal Trade Commission to step up enforcement against some outfits for abusing their nonprofit status . <P> Today 70% of individuals who file for bankruptcy protection do so under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code , which requires that most of your assets be confiscated but wipes out most debt , such as medical and credit-card bills ( though you 're still obligated to pay any child support , taxes and student loans ) . Under the new law , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your income is above the median in your state  --  and you can afford to pay at least $6,000 over five years  --  you will be forced into Chapter 13 , which requires a repayment plan for all debt . ( The national median income for a family of four is $65,093 , with state medians ranging from $45,867 in New Mexico to $87,412 in New Jersey . ) <P> Chapter 13 filers are given a budget with allowances for things like food and utilities but no amenities . Any income you earn above that level gets divvied among creditors for three to five years . ( Under the new law , more people will be pushed into five-year plans . ) And you may have to repay bigger chunks of certain types of debt , such as car loans . <P> The bottom line is that bankruptcy was always to be avoided  --  think of the emotional strain , the wrecked credit  --  but now even more so .
