IN 1844 THE UNITED STATES IS VERY MUCH A NATION FEELING ITS youth . Since the country was doubled in size by the Louisiana Purchase , there has been a passion for expansion , for pushing the boundaries farther west , a mission to bring the new enlightenment of the " American Ideal " to the entire continent . To politicians in Washington , this expansion is justified not just by an enthusiasm for our system of government , but by official policy . The document is the Monroe Doctrine , and the rallying cry becomes Manifest Destiny , as though it is not only in the nation 's best interests to expand our influence , but the best interest of anyone whose culture we might absorb . This practice has already resulted in bloody conflict with several Indian Nations , notably the Seminoles in Florida . It also leads to a showdown with the British over the Oregon Territory , a threat the British defuse by backing away . In summer 1844 the independent nation of Texas is annexed by the United States . The territory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent in 1836 when Mexican leader Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna was defeated by Sam Houston at the Battle of San Jacinto . This defeat followed Santa Anna 's highly publicized massacre of the defenders of the Alamo , in San Antonio . To the Mexican government , led by the moderate General Jos Joaquin de Herrera , the loss of Texas is a severe blow to Mexican pride . While Herrera favors negotiation to resolve differences , specifically the growing border disputes , loud voices of ultrapatriotism within his country consider the loss an outrage , an assault on the sovereignty of Mexico , which must be avenged . In December 1844 , Texas is officially granted statehood . The decision is controversial . Because it was admitted as a slave state , many in the north opposed Texas 's inclusion . However , as a necessary ingredient of Manifest Destiny , even opponents concede that the land , and the passion for expansion , make Texas a valuable treasure . The Texans consider their border to extend to the Rio Grande River . To the Mexicans , Texas stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north . The land in between the two rivers is mostly barren and uninhabited , but both sides begin making moves to secure the land for their own cause . To protect the new wave of citizens that move into the disputed area , President James K. Polk sends a military force of nearly three thousand men , under the command of General Zachary Taylor . This so inflames the spirits of many Mexicans that Herrera can not hold power , and he is replaced by General Mariano Padredes , an ultrapatriot who immediately declares that Mexico is in a state of " defensive war " with the United States . As the wheels of war grind forward , neither side seems to understand the forces driving the other . The Mexicans are far from accepting Manifest Destiny as legitimate , and the Polk Administration has no grasp of the nationalism and fiercely proud protectionism that so motivates the Mexicans . As Taylor 's forces move into the disputed territory between the two rivers , Mexican General Ampudia marches troops northward , intending to turn Taylor away . While politicians in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way of avoiding the inevitable war , Taylor confronts a sizable Mexican force at Palo Alto , a small crossroads village . The resulting fight is the first engagement of the war , and is a decided victory for Taylor and the Americans . The Mexicans retreat to a strong defensive position at an old riverbed called Resaca de la Palma . Taylor pursues , and defeats the Mexicans again . The Mexican forces have no choice but to retreat below the Rio Grande . With the spilling of blood , the disputes move beyond the angry protests of politicians . The diplomatic wrangling gives way to the harsh reality that the dispute over boundaries and the inability of each culture to understand the customs and needs of the other , has but one possible outcome . Even the voices of reason in both capitals are powerless to stop the momentum . On May 13 , 1846 , President Polk convinces Congress to declare war on Mexico . 1 . Lee March fifth , 1847 THEY HAD SAILED EARLY , CUTTING SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE quiet water , the rugged coastline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bow of the tall ship , staring out quietly , tasting the salt air , the cool wind that pushed into the great sails above him . At first he was alone , but then more of the officers were moving forward , and like Lee , they stared to the front , watching for any sign , the first glimpse of the rest of the great fleet . Lee glanced to one side , saw a small figure , thought , My dear friend Joe ... you look awful . He would never say that to the man 's face , knew Johnston was embarrassed , sensitive about his seasickness . The agony had been on Johnston 's face even before the ship had left Tampico , and it made no difference if the weather rolled them about or , like this morning , was ghostly calm . Joe Johnston would never be a sailor . Lee moved toward him , eased along the heavy wood rail . " You all right , Captain ? " Johnston , weary , his eyes heavy , looked at Lee , nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed scalp on Johnston 's head , looked away , would not let his friend catch him staring . He knew Johnston was a vain man , frustrated with the baldness that had shown itself when he was still young . He had a small frame , thin , and some at the Point had even used the word fragile to describe him . It had made Johnston furious , and Lee knew his vanity had been a form of self-defense . Johnston had begun to comb his hair straight forward , covering his high forehead . But today there was none of the self-consciousness , and Lee could not be pleased about that , knew it meant that Johnston was feeling sick indeed . Lee , still looking away , pointed out beyond the bow . " We 'll be there soon I think . The masts should come into view first . " Johnston nodded , looked now toward the horizon , his expression a mix of hope and a silent plea for the trip to end . Lee put a hand on Johnston 's shoulder , felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his grip . He pulled his hand away , thought , Maybe best to just let him be . He leaned out again on the rail , and now the sun had come up , full above the flat ocean to the east . He looked toward the warmth , felt the energy , felt a light salty breeze drifting across the deck . There was a new sound now , birds , the high call of the gulls , gathering , dancing in the air , near the stern of the ship . He looked up , smiled slightly , stared into the deep blue of a cloudless perfect morning . Suddenly there was a voice , behind him , high up on the lookout . " Ship ho ! " The men around Lee pressed forward , and Lee stared again to the front , saw now a fleck of orange , a brief flicker of sunlight reflecting on ... something . The others saw it as well , the soldiers betraying their excitement , while all around them the sailors seemed only to do their work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in front of them , they would not reveal it to these men who fought on land . Lee saw more reflections now , and someone had a pair of field glasses , passed them along the rail , and as each man took his turn , there was a smile , a small sound , recognition . Now the glasses came to Lee , and he raised them up , and the flecks of light were suddenly clear . He felt his heart thump hard in his chest , could not help but smile , thought , Yes , a ship ! He lowered the glasses , offered them to Johnston , who took them and without looking , passed them along . Lee wanted to say something , encourage his friend , to help him put the sickness aside somehow . Still Lee 's attention was drawn to the front , where there were a great many more reflections , and it did not take the glasses to see that before them , spread across the wide gulf , was an enormous fleet . The first big ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts turning , the helmsman steering General Winfield Scott 's flagship to a path closer to the warships . Lee was still feeling the excitement , examined the big ship as though he were a small child . He was stunned by the size , the great rows of small black eyes , the enormous firepower of the big man-of-war . He had seen ships like this before , near the forts in the East , but this was very different , moving past so close , the view from the deck of another great ship , so near the mouths of all those guns . Lee stared into the open gun ports , felt a sudden chill . My God , he thought , the pure power . So much artillery in one place . He had never seen a naval bombardment , certainly had never seen two great ships at war , swirling around each other in a violent fury of sound and smoke . He blinked , thought , No , you have never seen much of anything to compare to this .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
