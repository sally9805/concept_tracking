<p> BELLINGHAM , Wash .  --  Last summer , an underground pipeline ruptured in a city park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two 10-year-olds playing with a barbecue lighter . <p> After the 16-inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and 34 minutes , an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park . A plume of smoke rose 30,000 feet . <p> Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter . <p> " There was a spark and the sky turned orange , the boys both told me afterward , " says Frank King , whose son , Wade , was one of the boys in the park . Wade and his friend , Stephen Tsiorvas , were burned over 90% of their bodies . They died the next day . <p> Also killed was 18-year-old Liam Wood , who had graduated from high school five days before . The college-bound Wood was fly-fishing in the park when he was overcome by fumes , fell into the creek and drowned . <p> " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mark Asmundson , the mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle . In sparking the explosion , the boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the 241-acre park , he says . " The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city . " <p> On Monday , the Senate Commerce Committee held a one-day hearing here , about five minutes from where the incident occurred , on legislation to improve safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate them . The hearing included gripping , sometimes tearful , testimony from the boys ' parents as well as statements from state and federal officials . <p> " My baby died because of inaction . His death was preventable , " said Katherine Dalen , Stephen 's mother . <p> More than 2 million miles of iron , steel and plastic pipes  - -  some as large as 5 feet in diameter  --  snake beneath the earth and deliver oil , gasoline , natural gas and potential disaster across America every day . They range from the trans-Alaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ocean-going tankers by most measures , once-remote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan areas grow into their paths . <p> U.S. pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past 10 years . In the 1990s , there were 3,917 liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks , roughly one a day . The incidents , most involving local lines carrying natural gas , resulted in 201 deaths , 2,826 injuries and $ 778 million in property damage from 1990 through 1999 . <p> There also are environmental costs . In January , one of the nation 's largest pipeline companies , Koch Industries of Wichita , Kan. , paid a $ 30 million civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency water-pollution charges involving 300 oil spills from 1990 to 1997 . The EPA said Koch failed to inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs . <p> Liam Wood 's mother , Marlene Robinson , is focused on stronger regulations nationwide , including more and better inspections , and regional watchdog committees . <p> " I do n't have any children left to protect , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This did n't have to happen to Liam , and it does n't have to happen to other people 's children . " <p> Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation , one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water line was being installed in 1995 . But investigators also have many questions about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co. , which operates a network of pipelines along a 299-mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland , Ore . <p> Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) want to know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted more swiftly after the leak . But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel investigation by the U.S. Attorney 's Office . Several Olympic employees have declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against self-incrimination . <p> Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting two-thirds of the nation 's fuels by pipeline , and they warn that more rules could boost energy prices . Critics say pipelines are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , deteriorating . <p> The U.S. Transportation Department oversees pipelines . Its Office of Pipeline Safety sets standards for design , operation , maintenance and emergency response . Richard Felder , who heads the office , testified at Monday 's hearing . " Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever happening again , " he said . <p> In an earlier interview , he defended his office 's performance and the industry : " It 's a good record . It 's the safest form of transporting fuel , far and away . " <p> The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety , including requirements for signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers , but " there 's no such thing as risk elimination , " Felder says . " All you can do is manage it . " <p> But the chairman of the federal government 's transportation safety watchdog agency is unimpressed with Felder 's office and says it deserves a grade of F. " It 's been the most frustrating area I 've had to deal with as chairman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says no agency has a worse record of responding to NTSB recommendations . <p> In a recent speech , he said there 's no indication that the Office of Pipeline Safety " is in charge or that its regulations , its inspections , its assets , its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task . " <p> Felder takes issue with much of the criticism , but he endorses calls for more research into pipeline safety . He said his office is in the final stages of preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally sensitive areas . <p> He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is " third-party damage " from road , utility and construction work . The agency has worked to enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone call . <p> Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making decisions on housing and commercial development . " Local planning has not kept people away from pipelines , " he says . " It 's astounding to me . " <p> Felder bristles at critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and gas industry . " I ca n't agree with that one iota , " he says . " We try to balance the safety issue and the economic issue . " <p> The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sens . Patty Murray , D-Wash. , and Slade Gorton , R-Wash. ; Rep. Jack Metcalf , the Republican who represents Bellingham ; and Rep. Jay Inslee , a Democrat whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline . <p> The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines , boost federal spending on research , increase the number of federal pipeline inspectors nationwide  --  there now are 55  --  and expand states ' regulatory authority . On Monday , the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of Washington the temporary right to do more inspections . <p> The Murray-Gorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline workers and expand the public 's right to know about spills and leaks . <p> " I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened , " Murray says . " You always assume that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The Bellingham rupture not only dumped 278,000 gallons of gasoline into this city of 63,000 near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at Olympic Pipeline . " It 's hard for people to get interested in things they ca n't see . Out of sight is out of mind , " Mayor Asmundson says . He has visited the boys ' grieving families and lobbied Congress . The blast " has dominated my life since June 10 . " <p> Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny , he says . " The whole focus of the industry is containment . Do whatever you have to do locally , but do n't stir things up nationally . " <p> Last week , Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation Department 's inspector general . It faults the Office of Pipeline Safety for ignoring enhanced safety requirements , including increased inspections inside pipes , in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress required in 1992 and 1996 . <p> A U.S. General Accounting Office audit of operations is due in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline safety office on whether to restart the 39-mile section shut down since the Bellingham accident . Olympic Pipeline has repaired the line and is eager to reopen it . <p> People living along the route and officials are pushing for more extensive testing of the still-operating section of the line south of Bellingham . Felder says he has not decided whether it should be shut down . <p> Last week , Felder 's office ordered a new round of testing along the entire line , but critics such as Inslee are not convinced it will be enough . The tests must be conducted on the closed section of the pipeline before a decision is made on reopening it . <p> Contributing : Scott Hillkirk <p> Incidents in the 1990s <p> More than 200 people were killed in pipeline accidents from 1990 through 1999 .
