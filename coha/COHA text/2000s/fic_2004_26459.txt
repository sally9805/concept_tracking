... I would n't call it a jolly good time , but it 's not as bad as that . There are women , after all , and where there are women , I 'm bound to make merry .  - -  from Michael Stirling to his cousin John , the Earl of Kilmartin , posted from the 52nd Foot Guards during the Napoleonic Wars In every life there is a turning point . A moment so tremendous , so sharp and clear that one feels as if one 's been hit in the chest , all the breath knocked out , and one knows , absolutely knows without the merest hint of a shadow of a doubt that one 's life will never be the same . For Michael Stirling , that moment came the first time he laid eyes on Francesca Bridgerton . After a lifetime of chasing women , of smiling slyly as they chased him , of allowing himself to be caught and then turning the tables until he was the victor , of caressing and kissing and making love to them but never actually allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Francesca Bridgerton and fell so fast and so hard into love it was a wonder he managed to remain standing . Unfortunately for Michael , however , Francesca 's surname was to remain Bridgerton a mere thirty-six hours longer ; the occasion of their meeting was , lamentably , a supper celebrating her imminent wedding to his cousin . Life was ironic that way , Michael liked to think in his more polite moods . In his less polite moods , he used a different adjective entirely . And his moods , since falling in love with his first cousin 's wife , were not often polite . Oh , he hid it well . It would n't do to be visibly out of sorts . Then some annoyingly perceptive soul might actually take notice , and  --  God forbid  --  inquire as to his welfare . And while Michael Stirling held a not unsubstantiated pride in his ability to dissemble and deceive ( he had , after all , seduced more women than anyone cared to count , and had somehow managed to do it all without ever once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sodding truth of it was that he 'd never been in love before , and if ever there was a time that a man might lose his ability to maintain a faade under direct questioning , this was probably it . And so he laughed , and was very merry , and he continued to seduce women , trying not to notice that he tended to close his eyes when he had them in bed , and he stopped going to church entirely , because there seemed no point now in even contemplating prayer for his soul . Besides , the parish church near Kilmartin dated to 1432 , and the crumbling stones certainly could n't take a direct strike of lightning . And if God ever wanted to smite a sinner , he could n't do better than Michael Stirling . Michael Stirling , Sinner . He could see it on a calling card . He 'd have had it printed up , even  --  his was just that sort of black sense of humor  --  if he were n't convinced it would kill his mother on the spot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to torture the woman who 'd borne him . Funny how he 'd never seen all those other women as a sin . He still did n't . They 'd all been willing , of course ; you could n't seduce an unwilling woman , at least not if you took seduction at the true sense of the word and took care not to confuse it with rape . They had to actually want it , and if they did n't  --  if Michael sensed even a hint of unease , he turned and walked away . His passions were never so out of control that he could n't manage a quick and decisive departure . And besides , he 'd never seduced a virgin , and he 'd never slept with a married woman . Oh very well , one ought to remain true to oneself , even while living a lie  --  he 'd slept with married women , plenty of them , but only the ones whose husbands were rotters , and even then , not unless she 'd already produced two male offspring ; three , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had to have rules of conduct , after all . But this ... This was beyond the pale . Entirely unacceptable . This was the one transgression ( and he 'd had many ) that was finally going to blacken his soul , or at the very least  --  and this was assuming he maintained the strength never to act upon his desires  --  make it a rather deep shade of charcoal . Because this ... this  - -  He coveted his cousin 's wife . He coveted John 's wife . John . John , who , damn it all , was more of a brother to him than one of his own could ever have been . John , whose family had taken him in when his father had died . John , whose father had raised him and taught him to be a man . John , with whom  - -  Ah , bloody hell . Did he really need to do this to himself ? He could spend a sennight cataloguing all the reasons why he was going straight to hell for having chosen John 's wife with whom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to change one simple fact . He could n't have her . He could never have Francesca Bridgerton Stirling . But , he thought with a snort as he slouched into the sofa and propped his ankle over his knee , watching them across their drawing room , laughing and smiling , and making nauseating eyes at each other , he could have another drink . " I think I will , " he announced , downing it in one gulp . " What was that , Michael ? " John asked , his hearing superb , as always , damn it . Michael produced an excellent forgery of a smile and lifted his glass aloft . " Just thirsty , " he said , maintaining the perfect picture of a bon vivant . They were at Kilmartin House , in London , as opposed to Kilmartin ( no House , no Castle , just Kilmartin ) , up in Scotland , where the boys had grown up , or the other Kilmartin House , in Edinburgh ...
