<p> No one should have to read Night . Everyone must read it . In 1944 at the Nazi concentration camp called Buna , its author , a starving lad named Eliezer Wiesel , was made to watch along with thousands of other brutalized prisoners as the SS hanged three inmates , one of them a child , a " sad-eyed little angel . " <p> " Where is God ? Where is He ? " said a man just before the chairs on which the victims stood were tipped over . <p> " Then the march past began . The two adults were no longer alive . Their tongues hung swollen , blue-tinged . But the third rope was still moving ; being so light , the child was still alive . . . <p> " For more than half an hour he stayed there , struggling between life and death , dying in slow agony under our eyes . And we had to look him full in the face . He was still alive when I passed in front of him . His tongue was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Behind me , I heard the same man asking : <p> " ' Where is God now ? ' <p> " And I heard a voice within me answer him : <p> " ' Where is He ? Here He is  --  He is hanging here on this gallows . . . ' <p> " That night the soup tasted of corpses . " <p> Night , an autobiographical novel based on Wiesel 's experiences at Auschwitz and Buchenwald as well as Buna , was published in French in 1958 , then English in 1960 , and is widely considered the book that , along with Israel 's 1962 execution of Adolf Eichmann , chief architect of the Nazis ' deliberate extermination of Europe 's Jews , liberated a flood of repressed memories from traumatized survivors . <p> This second choice of the city 's annual " One Book , One Chicago " program is vastly different from the inaugural selection of last year , Harper Lee 's To Kill a Mockingbird . Though Mockingbird was of remarkably high literary quality , in essence it was a " good read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass audience . All but snobbishly high-minded readers enjoyed a rollicking , often joyous coming-of-age story while learning something useful and sobering about racial injustice in the American South during the Depression . <p> That novel 's powerful message was easy to swallow . <p> There is nothing popular or commercial about Night . Reading it is , as that passage shows , excruciating . In fact , because of its endless litany of evil it is a blessing that it is <p> so short  --  just 109 pages in the $5.99 Bantam paperback version . Still , other than the almost unbearable moral revulsion it makes the reader feel for the human race , there is nothing difficult about this book . It is written in short , stark sentences and moves along quickly because it is so riveting . Even seventh graders , if they have enough stomach to stand the horrific details it recounts , can read it in a couple of hours , probably one sitting . <p> It is that gripping because Wiesel is no bland , matter-of-fact witness to what he writes about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a superb spinner of tales . God , he once said , created human beings because he loved stories . <p> This is Wiesel 's story : <p> During the early years of World War II he was an adolescent Talmudic scholar in the little village of Sighet in Transylvania , then under Hungarian control . The Final Solution had not yet arrived in that backwater . When a poor man named Moshe the Beadle escapes from a concentration camp in Poland , makes his way back to Sighet and relates the horrors he had seen there , the sadly optimistic townspeople do not believe him . <p> But in 1944 the Nazis at last march into Hungary . First the Gestapo ghettoizes the Jews , then rounds them up and seals them into stinking , filthy , packed cattle cars for a hellish two-day rail journey to Birkenau , the reception center for Auschwitz . The trip is an experience so dehumanizing that young couples openly copulate in the cars despite the suffering throng sardined around them . It is the first experience young Elie has of the mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The smell of burning flesh from the bodies of children thrown into pits welcomes the travelers to Auschwitz , where the infamous SS doctor , Josef Mengele , divides the line of incoming prisoners into two , one bound for work and one bound for the ovens , and separated Elie and his father from his mother and sister , never to be seen again . <p> " Never shall I forget that night , the first night in camp , which has turned my life into one long night , seven times cursed and seven times sealed . Never shall I forget that smoke . Never shall I forget the little face of the children , whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky . " <p> Wiesel relates horror after horror until the reader 's mind grows numb with disbelief . With threats and beatings the Germans transform the prisoners into obedient automatons . Their hair shaved , their bodies doused in gasoline to kill lice , their clothes replaced by ill-fitting prison garb , they have one mission in life : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get enough to eat , to survive any way they can . So fixated on food do the prisoners become that a dying man braves a hail of SS bullets  --  unsuccessfully  --  to crawl toward two cauldrons of soup left out during an Allied air raid . <p> Elie in particular is determined to survive along with his father . His father  --  a mild-mannered shopkeeper  --  is repeatedly and brutally beaten with an iron bar by a foreman because Elie will not surrender his gold tooth . Elie eventually does and his father is spared , but during the fierce winter of 1945 , when they are both ailing , they decide to be evacuated to Buchenwald ahead of the advancing Russians instead of remaining behind in the hospital , fearing the Germans will annihilate them before pulling out of Buna . The horde of prisoners , bereft of humanity , run and stumble 42 miles through the snow to a smaller camp at Gleiwitz , the weak and dying shot by the Nazis where they fall . <p> After three days without food and water the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is killed before his eyes by a guard 's truncheon . A few weeks later Buchenwald is liberated by American tanks . <p> Is it any wonder that Wiesel revolted against God and declared him dead ? <p> He has said that the brutality of the Nazis and the suffering of their victims , including six million Jewish dead , was so inhuman that in the end it was a mystical event and therefore can not be understood  --  and the Holocaust can not be truly explained . But , paradoxically , Wiesel has made it his life 's work to make sure the world knows , remembers and understands all the details about Shoah , as Jews call the terrible event . And in all his books  --  he has said that Night is their core , the rest just commentary  --  he has argued mightily with the God he declared had died at the hangman 's hands in Buna . Wiesel is no atheist . <p> In an important sense Wiesel has failed in his mission  --  though that is hardly his fault . He had hoped that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth about the camps , that the world would turn away from the unutterable evil of genocide , and that books like his would no longer be necessary except as shrines to memory . But since then the massacres in the Balkans , in Rwanda , in Cambodia  --  and the world 's indifference to them  --  demonstrate that the idea of extermination of an entire people is one supposedly rational human beings can still entertain . And the mere existence of " Holocaust deniers , " small in numbers but viciously prominent on the Internet , who declare that Wiesel and others like him are liars and exaggerators , is disheartening . <p> Yet what else can Wiesel do ? Bearing witness against evil is one of the loneliest and most thankless tasks anyone can take upon himself . He is , as more than one critic has observed , the perfect example of Isaac Bashevis Singer 's definition of Jews as " a people who ca n't sleep themselves and let nobody else sleep . " <p> How can you sleep if you have not read Night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have read it ?
