// Cilantro ( Coriandrum sativum ) is really two herbs in one . The leaves , called cilantro or Chinese parsley , impart a musky , citruslike ( some even say " soapy " ) flavor to Mexican , Chinese and Thai cooking . The tiny , round seeds , called coriander , taste of sage and lemon or orange peel , and season many traditional Indian dishes , especially curries . Coriander roots also have culinary use . In Southeast Asia , they are dug , chopped and added to salty pickled condiments by many kitchen gardeners . This easy-to-grow herb is rich in vitamins A and C , and also contains iron and calcium . In the garden , coriander flowers attract beneficial insects . At the flowering and fruit-set stage , the plants give off a slightly acrid smell , which is probably why this herb 's botanical name is derived from the Greek word for bedbug , which emits a similar odor . In mature seeds , this odor vanishes . Some people find the unique smell and taste of fresh cilantro unpleasant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the herb 's popularity has skyrocketed in recent years . Cilantro enthusiasts eagerly eat the leaves raw , chopped into salsas or salads , and layered onto sandwiches . Cilantro is essential in Pad Thai Thailand 's best-known noodle dish - a delicious , spicy-sweet mix of rice noodles , tofu , shrimp or chicken , and eggs , flavored with fish sauce , garlic , chilies and ginger ( in addition to cilantro ) , and topped with peanuts . When used as a topping for rice noodles or in Oriental dipping sauces , cilantro and roasted peanuts often are chopped together . Down Mexico way , cilantro always brings salsa to life , whether it 's tomato-based , with avocados and beans , or fruit-based , using peaches , mangoes or even apples . For tamer palates , a bit of minced cilantro mixed into equal parts of butter and cream cheese makes a wonderful herb spread . Minced leaves stirred into sour cream make a refreshing accent for chili or other spicy soups . Add cilantro to cooked dishes , such as rice pilafs or beans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor . Coriander seeds , on the other hand , respond well to heat . When cooking with them , roast the seeds first in a warm , dry pan until you can smell their nutty aroma ; the roasting only takes a few minutes but it produces an absolutely divine scent . Then , coarsely grind or chop the roasted seeds with a heavy knife , or mortar and pestle . A few crushed coriander seeds make a welcome addition to any curry dish , and provide an ideal accompaniment to lentils , rice , mushrooms , tomatoes and many other vegetables . Left whole and coated with sugar rather than roasted , the seeds make a dessert-type treat called coriander comfit . Cilantro grows easily from seeds , or you can buy bunches of fresh cilantro and jars of dried coriander seeds in the produce and spice sections of most supermarkets . Cut stems of cilantro will keep in the refrigerator for several days in a plastic bag ( clip the stem ends off and set the sprigs in a glass of water before you slip on the plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rinsed and patted dry . When frozen , cilantro leaves retain much of their flavor ; when dried , leaves lose flavor . Store dry coriander seeds whole , in an airtight container , in a cool , dark place ; they will keep for more than a year . GROW YOUR OWN A fast-growing annual , cilantro thrives in cool weather . You will find seeds widely available on retail seed racks and in mail-order catalogs . Among named varieties , ' Santo ' is a little slower to bolt than the species ( wild ) cilantro , and ' Festival ' and ' Janta ' have large leaves that help them grow quickly to a mature size . When sown in the fall , established plants of any variety often survive winter in U.S. Department of Agriculture Zones 7 and 8 . Where hard freezes are frequent , the plants need the protection of a plastic tunnel . In all climates , sow seeds at least twice a year where you want the plants to grow - first thing in spring and again in late summer , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use only a little fer-tilizer - too much can make the leaves taste bland . Photograph // For quick germination , soak seeds in water overnight before planting out ; bury the seeds about an inch deep . If too many seedlings appear , thin the plants to about 5 inches apart . Cilantro can be transplanted if the operation is conducted with minimal disturbance to the roots , but this plant grows so well when sown directly into the garden that starting seeds indoors is hardly worth the trouble . Begin picking leaves as needed when the plants are about 6 weeks old . Soon afterward ( especially in spring , when days quickly become longer and warmer ) , the shape of the leaves becomes very thin and feathery , and the plants suddenly grow taller and prepare to flower ( the process known as bolting ) . If you like edi-ble flowers , try some of the tiny white blossoms sprinkled onto salads . To harvest coriander seeds , cut the stems when about half of the seeds have changed from green to grayish-tan . Gather the stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside-down in a warm , dry place for about two weeks . To glean ( harvest ) the seeds , place a paper bag beneath the bunch and gently tickle the seeds from the stems . Dump the seeds into a dry pan , sort by hand and store in airtight glass jars until you 're ready to plant or eat them .
