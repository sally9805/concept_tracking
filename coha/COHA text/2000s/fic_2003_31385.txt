November 28 , 1990 Please hand deliver to : Miss Irene Kelly Las Piernas News Express 600 Broadway Las Piernas , CA Dear Miss Kelly , I am writing to you because those guys who write the Sports Section are a bunch of jerks who wo n't take me seriously . My dog , Pigskin , can predict the outcome of the Super Bowl . So far , he has a perfect record . Once the playoff teams have been decided , I simply glue the team emblems to the bottoms of two dishes of dog food , put them on the floor , and whichever one Pigskin goes to , that 's which team will win . I think this is pretty interesting and thought maybe you should do a story on it ... I crumpled that one into a ball and spiked Pigskin right into the round file  --  and did it all left-handed . But after a moment , I pulled the letter back out of the trash . Setting aside my generally rotten mood that day , I decided Pigskin might be of help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mail that Wednesday afternoon in late November , I had already sorted out the flyers on meetings and the invitations to local political wingdings . That left only the pile of the envelopes which were less easily identified . Some were handwritten , some typed , some bore computer-generated labels . Few had return addresses . I. Kelly Las Piernas News Express Dear Bleeding Heart Kelly , The recent media worship of the Premier of the Soviet Union is disgusting . Presenting Mr. Gorbachev as areformer is the most insidious communist plot yet . Not that you lily-livered leftists of the press are hard to fool , but I think it should be obvious that this is all just a charade to get us to drop our guard ... I was unfazed by these unflattering descriptions of my internal organs . I admit that I was a little distracted , not paying much attention to the occasional crank among my readers ' correspondence . My mail is n't always as oddball as it was that day , but the approach of certain major holidays seems to make nut cases reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who just need somebody to listen to them . Every now and again , one of them causes some trouble , like the guy who showed up in the newsroom one day with his parrot , claiming the bird was the reincarnation of Sigmund Freud . I do n't know what women want , but Sigmund wanted a cracker . Ms. Irene Kelly Las Piernas News Express Dear Irene , I very much enjoyed the recent commentary column in which you said that the state lottery is a tax on hope . I agree with you one hundred percent . You are the brightest , most insightful writer on the staff of the Express . Your prose is brilliant . I was greatly impressed by your grasp of the complex statistical data on the Eberhardt study of lottery purchasing patterns , as well as your ability to clearly explain the study 's significance to the average reader . I would really like to meet you , but if this is not possible , would you please send me a pair of your panties ? Lydia Ames laughed as she read that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an ACE , or Assistant City Editor . " Going to show that one to your fiance ? " I gave her my best scowl . She 's known me since third grade , so she was n't much intimidated . She really delighted in that word " fiance . " Like a lot of other people I know , she 's spent a number of years wondering if I would ever give her any reason to use it . I had been getting a lot of this " fiance " stuff lately ; given the way Frank Harriman had proposed , I doubt we could have managed a secret engagement . As if thinking about the very same thing , Lydia looked down at the new cast my orthopedist had just put on my right foot that afternoon . " Did you save the ' Marry me , Irene ' cast ? " " My fiance has it . " She caught my tone . " I guess you 're really disappointed about having to wear another one . " " Yeah , I am . I hobbled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look how I ended up . " " Well , at least you 're out of the sling , and the doctor did take the cast off your right hand . " " And replaced it with a splint . " " A removable splint . " " Terrific . He walks in and announces , ' So today we 'll give you a new foot cast ! This one will be easier to walk with ! It 's made of fiberglass ! ' Acting like I 'd won a Rolls-Royce in a church raffle . " She did n't say anything . I sighed , looking down at my latest orthopedic fashion accessory . Fiberglass . I was recovering from a run-in with a group of toughs who wanted to rearrange my bones . I was healing , but my emotions could still surprise me . This was my first week back at work , and I found I had to be on guard against sudden bouts of extreme frustration . " Sorry , Lydia . I 'll cheer up in a few minutes . Things are n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , no casts , no slings , no splints . My day to be wrong . I 'm also cranky because I feel useless around here . " " Just be patient with yourself , okay ? " " I 'll try . But patience and I have been estranged for many years . " She laughed . " I do n't think you 've been introduced . " Mr. Irene Kelly Las Piernas News Express Dear Mr. Kelly , I am writing again to tell you that something must be done to stop the United States Government 's heinous MIND CONTROL experiments . I am just one of THOUSANDS of persons who , after being INVOLUNTARILY incarcerated in a government mental hospital under the PRETEXT of being under observation , was subjected to surgery in which a computer chip was embedded under my skin . This chip is used by the government to send MESSAGES TO MY BRAIN . Fortunately , I received an earlier model , so THEY DO N'T KNOW that I 'm writing to you . The newer models can tell them EVERYTHING you are thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , there will be big trouble for all concerned ... Big trouble . Frank has complained that sometimes I seem to go around looking for trouble . Not a comforting thing to hear a homicide detective say , but maybe he 's right . After all , being a reporter often involves looking for somebody 's trouble . But it 's not supposed to become my trouble . My news editor , John Walters , tries to impress this point on me every so often . Irene Kelly Las Piernas New Express Dear Irene Kelly , I was dismayed to learn that Las Piernas does not have a city song . I am a songwriter ( still waiting for my big break ) and I know I could write a terrific song for our city . However , I would like to be fair about it , so I came up with the idea of a contest . I asked around City Hall and found little interest there until I happened to talk to a Mr. P.J. Jacobsen who said that maybe the newspaper could sponsor a contest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said to be sure to tell you that this was the least he could do for you after that article you wrote about him last August ... Poor P.J. " Sleepy " Jacobsen . What a lousy attempt at revenge . The previous August , I had brought the public 's attention to the slipshod way in which Sleepy ran his office as Assistant City Treasurer . I guess he had n't heard that old adage that says you should n't pick fights with people who buy ink by the barrel . The Express buys it by the tanker truckload . I was n't concentrating at all now , just flipping through the envelopes , bored silly . Among other injuries , my right shoulder had been dislocated and my right thumb had been broken , so I was slow as molasses on the keyboard . Over the last few days , I had managed to peck out a few commentary columns and a couple of obits . Lydia sent some rewriting my way , nothing that was on fire . My thoughts drifted to Frank , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know what you need ? " he had said , glancing over at me . " You need a good story to work on . Something that will get your mind off your injuries . " " I 'm not much use as a reporter right now . Besides , the most intriguing stories do n't just knock on the paper 's front door , looking for a reporter . You have to go out and find them . And I 'm stuck at a desk . " Nobody 's right all the time . As I said , it was my day to be wrong . That November afternoon , trouble came looking for me . Trouble got lucky . There was a story waiting for me on my desk . It was over two thousand years old , but it would become big news in no time .
