The Road to Rome On a bright fall morning in 1994 , Doug Ivester , the recently anointed president of the Coca-Cola Company , was driving himself to Rome , Georgia , spinning north along the interstate , the steel-and-glass towers of Atlanta receding behind him as the landscape became an uneven blanket of pines . // Ivester had his day all planned out . Like plenty of Coke executives before him , he had a certain fixation with Hollywood  --  the glitter , the lights , the adjustable distance between image and reality . And now he was going to star in his own short film , which he had already named The Road to Rome . // He had borrowed a sport-utility vehicle and hired a camera crew . Husky and hawk-nosed , he had dressed down for the occasion in a V-neck sweater and left his usual silk necktie at home . He aimed the boxy car toward Rome , pulling over every so often at all kinds of places to ask whether they served Coca-Cola . // It became an exercise in frustration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company that owned the Coca-Cola brand . The cameras trailed Ivester at every stop , recording the scene at a karate studio where the flustered owner apologetically explained before the inquiring lens that he didn ? t sell Coke , and at the Kennesaw Mountain tourist attraction , where there was no Coke , either . In his reedy North Georgia twang , Ivester kept asking everyone in his path the same apparently simple question : What if people coming to these places wanted a Coke ? What if they finished training for their black belt , looked around for a way to quench their thirst , and realized there was no place nearby to get their hands on a Coke ? // There was only one right answer in the script that he had dictated : They ? d be disappointed . So would hundreds , no , millions of other people across the globe , in all of the other places where Coke still wasn ? t for sale in every possible nook that it could be sold . The message of the film  --  that even right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coke , the Coca-Cola Company still had plenty of room to grow  --  was an ongoing theme inside the company . And Ivester was going to make sure Coke got every last bit of that growth . // There would be no Oscars for The Road to Rome , which was completed on a modest budget that year and screened before limited audiences  --  Wall Street analysts mostly , and here and there a Coke bottler . But it was remarkable nevertheless , articulating something beyond the typical corporate statement of purpose . It was a graphic guide to the mentality of the Coca-Cola Company and the mind of the man who now occupied its second-highest position : a man who believed fervently and unremittingly in the supremacy of Coca-Cola . // That the drink was more than a century old and was still not being sold absolutely everywhere hounded Ivester . People close to him claimed that he could not sleep at night if he knew that a store somewhere in the depths of the nation , any nation , was not selling Coca-Cola . Maybe it was the pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Coke director , visited one day with his grandson , only to report back that it served nothing but Pepsi . Ivester made it his personal project to get the Pepsi out and the Coca-Cola in ; within weeks , he had made the change . Maybe it was a country like Vietnam , where for years American business had been prohibited . Awaiting the day the embargo might end , Ivester had a plane loaded with Cokes and signs and other equipment intended to capture the new market . In 1994 , a few hours after the State Department gave American companies the green light to invest again in Vietnam , the Coke plane took off . It was on a mission to restore the business that politics had inconveniently halted almost twenty years earlier . // Like many of the people at his company , Ivester had a relentless faith in the drink ? s appeal for people of all ages , races , cultures , and economic profiles . To him , if Coke was on the shelf , or in the vending machine , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s what people would buy . But still , even in tried-and-true Coke country , like the hills of Georgia  --  the part of America where Ivester himself grew up  --  there were plenty of places that didn ? t stock it . And the key to filling in all those holes , to completing the program put forth by legions of Coke men culminating with Ivester , was to seal the gaps between the Coca-Cola Company and its historically feisty and independent bottling system . // The Coca-Cola Company was 108 years old on the morning that Ivester set off for Rome , and it was already the biggest soft-drink company in the world . Nineteen ninety-four was its greatest year yet . People drank Coca-Cola morning , noon , and night in the United States , where Coke had gotten started . In many places Coca-Cola stood in for coffee as the way people began their day . It had replaced milk and fruit juice in many lunchboxes , even in baby bottles in some places , if everything you heard was true . Ivester liked to predict that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a formal table setting would have to include a broad-shouldered Coca-Cola glass . // That was just one of Ivester ? s goals . And he usually got what he wanted . Over the previous decade , he had transformed Coke from a nodding institu- tion into a sleek and ultra-competitive global champion , envied and imitated by dozens of other American companies . Along with two colleagues , Roberto Goizueta and Donald Keough , he had created a monolith that tapped skillfully into emerging markets and pumped unexpected growth out of old ones . They had turned a well-known brand-name soda into a money machine , an ice-veined fountain jingling with cash . As Ivester drove along the road to Rome , Coca-Cola was the best-known product in the world . The company was selling Coke at the rate of 850 million eight-ounce bottles a day , or 310 billion bottles a year . Stacked one on top of another , a year ? s worth of global Coke sales would create a tower reaching nearly all the way to Mars . Fourteen months of sales would get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for Ivester. // Like Goizueta , he wanted the consumption of Coke to keep on growing . Now that Keough had retired , it was just the two of them , and they aggressively promoted the company ? s prospects , touting the opportunities to sell ever more Coca-Cola worldwide before an impressed Wall Street . The Coca-Cola Company was all about growth , the men of Coke insisted . With close to a billion servings sold every day , they believed that the company had only just begun to make its mark in the world . Two billion servings were just around the corner . // They made these kinds of promises publicly , and they programmed their company to fulfill them . They had kept those promises again and again over the previous thirteen years , posting spectacular gains in sales and in earnings , beating not just the competition but most of the rest of industrial America , as well . Ivester ? s movie was really just another reminder , in case anyone needed reminding , not to underestimate Coke . // So complete was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained a distant also-ran to other beverages in many parts of the globe . It was not just a matter of vanquishing Pepsi-Cola ; it was also about beating back drinks like coffee , tea , milk , and water . In fly-blown , malnourished parts of Asia and Africa , people still  --  inexplicably , if you asked Ivester  --  preferred tea or juice to Coca-Cola . In France , people might buy three kinds of bottled water in their supermarkets  --  and , incredibly , pass up the red cans of Coca-Cola . If Coke could capture those markets , persuading consumers to drink cola instead , then the brand would grow even more . That was what Ivester and Goizueta wanted . That was what their planning was all about . // They wanted Coca-Cola everywhere . In refrigerated cases in convenience stores , out on the street in barrels packed with ice , in vending machines in school hallways , in the basements and pantries of people ? s houses , and on tap at restaurants , ball parks , movie theaters , hotels , cruise ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . When a person drove into a gas station , they wanted him to think Coke first . When somebody stood in a movie line and had to choose something to drink during the 7:15 show , they wanted it to be Coke . They wanted Coke to be available every time somebody felt a stab of thirst . And , whenever possible , they wanted it to be the only beverage on the shelf . // To the two men who held the top jobs at Coke in 1994 , this was not some eccentric , highly personal approach to commerce . It was the cornerstone of their business plan . They told people like Warren Buffett about it , and he applauded them , despite the risks . " In given countries at given times there will be hiccups , " Buffett would say . " But that doesn ? t take your eye off where you want to be ten or fifteen years from now , which is to have everybody drink nothing but Coke . " They had made their promises to people like him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year by year , Ivester and Goizueta invested a lot in the outcome . For the more Coke people consumed , the more money would flow into the Coca-Cola Company , which produced the concentrate  --  a dark , sticky , undrinkable ooze  --  that became the soda . More money meant greater profits , which would lift the stock price , making all the people who had invested in it  --  the grannies in Atlanta ; the great capitalists in New York , Los Angeles , and Omaha ; and , not least , the grand executives of Coke , their accounts bulging with stock options , restricted stock , and ordinary stock  --  wealthier with every day that went by . // To Ivester , careful planning was critical to making sure that happened . He saw potential in microscopic terms . He started with his employees , all 29,000 of them around the world . It was the duty and the obligation of every person associated with Coca-Cola , he asserted , to remember the Coca-Cola Company ? s mission and to do everything within his or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public areas in Coke ? s headquarters with monitors that displayed the stock price from the moment the market opened . He became notorious for walking around foreign markets , demanding to know why some tiny Chinese grocery store didn ? t have Coke on the shelves , or peering into the trash cans on the banks of the Nile to find out what people were drinking  --  how much Coke , and how much of everything else . He could be standing under a cloudless sky in the middle of a shantytown in South Africa , where desperately poor people nestled beside garbage heaps crawling with flies and vermin , and he would see , in addition to the problems , another great place to sell Coca-Cola . Reaching into the trunk of his limousine , he would produce a case of Coke and press it upon a local merchant , insisting that if the man could make a living selling ice cream or peanuts or dried squid or whatever he already had in his cart , he could do better with Coke . // By the time Ivester became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate for many other kinds of beverages  --  grape drink , orange juice , canned coffee , green tea  --  but to Ivester and Goizueta , center stage belonged to Coca-Cola . Part of the attitude was historic ; this was , after all , the soft drink that had given rise to the company in the first place . Much of it was financial : The margins on Coca-Cola concentrate , which cost pennies a gallon to make , were the most enormous of all . For people who thought strictly in terms of numbers , Coke was it . // Robert Woodruff , the most legendary Coca-Cola executive of all , had preached putting Coke " within an arm ? s reach of desire " ; Ivester took that further , endorsing concepts like " a 360-degree landscape of Coke , " where Coke ads , products , and vending machines would assert themselves everywhere a person looked , making you buy a Coke even if you hadn ? t known that ? s what you wanted . He exhorted everyone in the company to remember that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant always selling more and more Coca-Cola . His directive included the basic administrative level , like secretaries and security guards . It fanned upward through the great superstructure of jobs and responsibilities , tapering to the corner office where he , Ivester , expected one day to sit . In case people forgot , there were reminders everywhere : the stock price beaming from the elevator lobby , and the admonitions , mild and severe , delivered to people who dared drink a beverage made by some other company or take their jobs less than totally seriously . It was supposed to be not one drink among many , but only Coca-Cola . // Ivester epitomized the strict focus on Coke that he wanted to see across the ranks . He could cite the company ? s stock price at any given moment ( he checked it constantly ) and remembered when Coke first sold a million cases a year in Shanghai ( 1926 ) . He leaned on Coke ? s customers  --  restaurants , vending-machine owners , airlines , supermarkets , hotels  --  to do more to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more accounts and to invest heavily in their businesses , again to sell more Coke . And he didn ? t like to take no for an answer . // He had made bottlers a critical element in his campaign , as they had been for most of Coca-Cola ? s history . The company made only soft-drink concentrate , sold as a dry powder or as a syrup . Both had to be transformed , with bubble-filled water and user-friendly packaging , into something that would fit into a consumer ? s hand and taste good going down . That was the bottlers ? job . For generations , the bottlers had defined how they would get that done , and they prospered according to how well they performed . // But Ivester had come up with a better idea . He relaxed a little thinking about it , resting his left arm along the edge of the car door as northern Georgia unfolded past the window . // Sitting beside him in the passenger seat was a man named Jimmy Wardlaw . Wardlaw had once worked for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enterprises in Atlanta , a giant substitute for the independent bottlers that had been conceived , created , and spun off at the suggestion of Ivester . Wardlaw was the kind of bottler Ivester liked . Too many of the other bottlers out there were the kind Coke executives thought the Coca-Cola Company would be better off without . //
