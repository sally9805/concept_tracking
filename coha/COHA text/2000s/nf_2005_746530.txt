Chasing submarines , putting F-16s on alert : it 's the stuff of Hollywood Cold War thrillers , but in a maritime boundary and island sovereignty dispute in the East China Sea , it 's all too real. ( n1 ) In the last 12 months , tensions between Japan and the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) over their maritime boundary  --  and among Japan , the PRC and Taiwan over ownership of the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands  --  have escalated dramatically. ( n2 ) The recent downturn in relations over the oil-rich region began in November 2004 when a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force surveillance plane detected a " foreign " submarine submerged off the Sakishima Islands , approximately 75 miles south of the disputed area , and within Japan 's declared exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) . ( n3 ) The following day Japan announced that it had two destroyers and a surveillance plane in the region , which had been trailing the still unidentified sub through the night. ( n4 ) Although the submarine evaded capture , the PRC acknowledged that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incident. ( n5 ) At the same time , diplomatic problems surrounding the publication of a new Japanese school textbook have acted further to enflame the situation by bringing additional public attention to the tensions that exist between the PRC and Japan. ( n6 ) Newspaper headlines such as " Japan stokes China sea dispute " and " China 's power hunger trumps Japan diplomacy " give some indication of how these issues are being reported globally. ( n7 ) <p> The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands sovereignty issue complicates the maritime dispute over where to draw the boundary line between Japanese and PRC waters . The islands lie between latitude 2558 ' North , longitude 12341 ' East and latitude 2544 ' North , longitude 12329 ' East. ( n8 ) Little more than rocky outcrops , the five islands are completely uninhabited and of little intrinsic value . However , the possible presence of oil deposits nearby has made their contested sovereignty increasingly problematic . As Ji Guoxing states succinctly : <p> The controversy involves two dimensions : territorial sovereignty over islands , and relevant jurisdictional rights and interests in maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the demarcation disputes are mainly due to differing interpretations of the law of the sea. ( n9 ) <p> The dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands originated in 1895 , when the Japanese Diet declared sovereignty over them. ( n10 ) However , it remained dormant until the late 1960s , when a report prepared by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East , under the auspices of the United Nations , suggested that large hydrocarbon deposits might exist in the waters near the island group. ( n11 ) According to Seokwoo Lee , the report stated that the " shallow sea floor between Japan and Taiwan might contain substantial resources of petroleum , perhaps comparable to the Persian Gulf area . " ( n12 ) As a result , the PRC became increasingly interested in asserting a claim to the islands and in their possible effect on the position of its maritime boundary with Japan . The situation was exacerbated in 1972 when the nearby Ryukyu Islands ( which had been placed under U.S. trustee ship by the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty ) were returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were included in this transfer . However , the PRC protested that since the islands had not been identified as belonging to Japan in the 1951 treaty , they could not be " returned " to them . <p> Current tensions over the maritime boundary and the sovereignty of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands can be traced to the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s and the continuing rise of the PRC to fill the power vacuum left in East Asia. ( n14 ) As the PRC has begun to assert itself in the region , it has sought to establish maritime claims , arguing that the boundary with Japan should be set at the natural prolongation of the continental shelf . Conversely , Japan has argued that the maritime boundary should be delimited along the equidistance line between the two states . In an attempt to legitimate Japan 's control of the contested Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands , in 1996 the Japanese Diet publicly proclaimed sovereignty over them. ( n15 ) The PRC refused to accept Japan 's territorial claim to the islands and began deploying maritime survey ships to the region. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships had unlawfully transgressed its waters and sent its own coast guard vessels to the area . Tensions reached their highest point in the last two years , partly as a result of the PRC decision to begin test-drilling for oil and gas in the region . <p> To understand the context of these scenarios better , this study makes a critical analysis of the key legal regimes of maritime jurisdiction established by the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) . In addition , we consider various methods of boundary delimitation and offer examples of borders the delimitation of which stands out in the debate . This discussion provides an essential framework for analyzing the East China Sea dispute . The second half of this paper will examine some options for the resolution of this and other maritime boundary disputes . MARITIME ZONES <p> Historically , the international law of the sea emerged out of debates in the early 17th century between thinkers such as Dutch legal scholar Hugo Grotius , who advocated open access to the oceans for all nations ( mare liberum ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who believed that the world 's oceans should be appropriated by and divided among the coastal states or naval powers ( mare clausum ) . ( n17 ) This debate included the breadth of states ' territorial seas , on which there was no consensus . Thus , until the second half of the 20th century , the law of the sea was generally restricted to dealing with jurisdiction aboard vessels . <p> In 1945 , the United States issued the Truman Proclamation on the Continental Shelf , claiming " the exercise of jurisdiction over the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf " extending from the U.S. shoreline. ( n18 ) In the wake of this proclamation and in light of the growing interest in offshore exploration of hydrocarbon resources , the first UN Conference on the Law of the Sea concluded four conventions on 29 April 1958. ( n19 ) These became known as the 1958 Geneva Conventions and included instruments on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone , the High Seas , Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first codifications of the international law of the sea , they have been superseded by UNCLOS , which was negotiated from 1974 to 1982 and entered into force in November 1994 . Baselines and Internal Waters <p> As stipulated in UNCLOS , zones of maritime sovereignty are measured from three types of baselines . The " normal baseline , " applicable for most coastal states , is the low water line of its coastline. ( n20 ) However , states with coastlines that are " deeply indented " or " fringed with islands " are allowed to establish straight baselines in order to simplify the task of defining maritime jurisdiction. ( n21 ) A state composed of one or more archipelagos can draw baselines that effectively enclose all of that state 's islands . While there are stringent regulations for drawing archipelagic baselines , only general guidelines exist for the construction of straight baselines ; as a result , many coastal states have established straight baselines , often in quite inappropriate circumstances. ( n22 ) The waters landward of straight baselines and bay and river-closing lines are considered internal waters. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , similar to land territory , lakes and rivers . Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone <p> A coastal state can claim a territorial sea out to 12 nautical miles ( nm ) from the baseline . This was the standard established in UNCLOS after being the subject of much debate during the conferences both in 1958 and from 1974 to 1982 . Within the territorial sea , a coastal state has full sovereignty over the sea bed , water column , surface and airspace above. ( n24 ) However , vessels from other states have a right of innocent passage through territorial sea. ( n25 ) A coastal state can also claim a contiguous zone , extending up to 12 nm beyond the territorial sea. ( n26 ) In this area , a coastal state has the right to apprehend vessels that may have committed an offense within its territory or territorial sea , or to prevent infringement of certain laws within the territory and territorial sea , such as customs and immigration matters . Exclusive Economic Zone <p> The major innovation in UNCLOS was the creation of the exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continental shelf with rights over the water column beyond the territorial sea. ( n27 ) It was a compromise between states that wanted more control over offshore areas and those that wanted to retain as large an area as possible as high seas . A coastal state can claim an EEZ extending up to 200 nm from the baseline. ( n28 ) Within this zone , the coastal state has " sovereign rights " to explore , exploit , conserve and manage the living and non-living resources of the water column ( e.g. , fish ) , sea floor ( e.g. , crustaceans , metallic deposits on the sea floor ) and the seabed ( e.g. , hydrocarbons ) . ( n29 ) A coastal state also has jurisdiction in the EEZ with regard to building and maintaining artificial islands , conducting scientific research and conserving the environment . However , a coastal state can not restrict freedom of navigation within the EEZ , flight above it or the laying of submarine pipelines or cables through it. ( n30 ) Continental Shelf <p> Article 76 of UNCLOS defines a coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin . " All coastal states automatically have jurisdiction over the seabed and subsoil up to 200 nm from the baseline , regardless of whether the physical continental margin extends that far or not . States whose continental margin extends beyond 200 nm must define the outer limit of the continental shelf and submit the claimed limit for approval by the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. ( n31 ) Regardless of the physical extent of the margin , state jurisdiction can not extend beyond 350 nm from the baseline or 100 nm beyond the 2,500-meter isobath. ( n32 ) The rights of the coastal state over the continental shelf are effectively the same as in the EEZ : sovereign rights to explore and exploit the natural resources of the sea floor and sea bed of the continental shelf. ( n33 ) However , these do not extend to the water column or to any other rights related to the surface or airspace. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed through legislation , rights over the continental shelf exist ipso facto and do not need to be declared. ( n35 ) High Seas <p> Maritime areas beyond EEZs are defined in UNCLOS Part VII as the high seas , in which all states , land-locked as well as coastal , have the freedom to navigate , over fly , construct artificial islands , lay submarine cables/pipeline , fish and conduct scientific research. ( n36 ) The high seas are to be used for peaceful purposes only and no state can make a claim to sovereignty or jurisdiction over them. ( n37 ) MARITIME CLAIMS AROUND THE WORLD <p> The map of maritime claims around the world is complex . In several cases , states with overseas territories make different claims for each territory For example , in 1996 , Denmark claimed a 200 nm EEZ . However , it specified that the claim did not extend to the maritime zones off the Faroe Islands or Greenland , which continue to maintain separate 200 nm fishery zones and continental shelf claims based on earlier Danish legislation. ( n38 ) The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Islands ; many dependencies ( such as Anguilla , the British Virgin Islands and Gibraltar ) still have just a 3 nm territorial sea. ( n39 ) <p> Such divergent practices make clear enumeration of maritime jurisdiction a difficult task . However , the following figures may provide a useful starting point . There are 153 coastal states worldwide . Of these , 129 states are parties to UNCLOS and a further 12 have signed , but not ratified , the Convention. ( n40 ) The states that have ratified UNCLOS have an obligation to submit a list of coordinates , or a chart which illustrates their maritime claims , to the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea , as directed by Article 16(2) of UNCLOS . However , as of 14 October 2005 , only 26 states had submitted information regarding their territorial seas and only 22 states had deposited a chart or list of coordinates defining their EEZ and/or continental shelf claims , as directed by Articles 75(2) and 84(2) . Just 16 states had provided both of these documents. ( n41 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , seven states ( Benin , Republic of Congo , Ecuador , El Salvador , Liberia , Peru and Somalia ) claim a 200 nm territorial sea . However , they have received criticism from the international community , since the 12 nm limit for territorial seas has now assumed the status of customary international law . Four coastal states and a number of non-state dependencies claim exclusive fisheries jurisdiction out to 200 nm , but not a full EEZ. ( n42 ) Additionally , four states have claimed fisheries zones to specified distances offshore beyond their 12 nm territorial seas but less than 200 nm . Fourteen coastal states have made no explicit claims beyond their territorial sea and contiguous zones . Almost all of the states in this category are restricted within tightly confined seas or bays and have only very small areas of possible maritime jurisdiction. ( n43 ) If all coastal states around the world claimed the maximum 200 nm EEZ and continental shelf allowed by UNCLOS , approximately 44.5 percent of the world 's maritime areas would be under some form of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( See Figure 1 ) . ( n44 ) MARITIME BOUNDARIES <p> The task of providing a clear overview of maritime boundaries around the world is also problematic . Many maritime boundaries have multiple , non-contiguous segments , which some might argue should be considered separate boundaries . For example , Canada and the United States have four , non-contiguous maritime boundary segments : one extending off the Atlantic coast into the Gulf of Maine , another extending off the Pacific coast between Washington state and British Columbia , and two more extending from the northern and southern termini of Alaska 's land boundary . However , in many cases , multiple segments are delimited within a single bilateral agreement . Therefore , in analyzing these agreements , it is easier to identify the number of bilateral boundaries first , and then identify the number of segments separately . Thus , for example , Canada and the United States could be said to have one maritime boundary with four non-contiguous segments . In addition , maritime boundary agreements vary widely and , in many cases , the entire boundary is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full potential boundary , or delimit sections which do not connect with neighboring boundaries . <p> We have calculated that there are a total of 365 potential maritime boundaries around the world with an additional 60 non-contiguous segments . There are 201 maritime boundaries ( 160 boundaries with 41 additional , non-contiguous segments ) which have at least one agreement , comprising 47.3 percent of potential boundaries . This leaves a total of 224 maritime boundaries ( 205 boundaries with 19 additional , non-contiguous segments ) without any agreement , comprising 52.7 percent of potential maritime boundaries . Between 1970 and 1982 , approximately eight maritime boundary agreements were concluded each year . However , since 1982 ; the average number of boundary agreements concluded annually has leveled at just over five . At that rate , it will take another 45 years to conclude the remaining 224 potential boundaries around the world , assuming a best case scenario that each agreement would establish a full-length boundary . " Equitable Solution " and International Jurisprudence <p> UNCLOS itself provides little guidance for delimiting maritime boundaries . Article 15 specifies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a maritime boundary between the territorial seas of two states will follow the equidistance line. ( n45 ) However , this only applies out to the 12 nm limit of the territorial sea , and states can certainly agree on an alternative boundary if they wish . The equidistance line is not referred to in either Articles 74 or 83 of UNCLOS relating to delimitation of EEZ and continental shelf boundaries , which simply state that delimitation should be " effected by agreement on the basis of international law.in order to achieve an equitable solution . " ( n46 ) This is a significant departure from Article 6 of the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf , which used the same terminology as Article 15 of UNCLOS for maritime boundary delimitation. ( n47 ) However , UNCLOS is silent on what represents an " equitable solution " in determining maritime boundaries , and courts and tribunals have continued to favor solutions based on equidistance . <p> Nevertheless , in many cases , the equidistance line proves to be inappropriate for establishing a fair and equitable maritime boundary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) discovered that equidistance lines drawn from the coastlines of the Netherlands , Germany and Denmark were not equitable , since the concave nature of the coastlines left Germany with only a small wedge of maritime space. ( n8 ) In the 1985 Libya/Malta case and the 1993 Denmark/Norway ( Jan Mayen ) case , the ICJ found strict equidistance lines to be inappropriate because of disparities in the comparative lengths of the coastlines involved ( See Figure 2 ) . ( n49 ) <p> The principle of strict equidistance can also have distorting effects in setting the boundaries between islands and mainland coasts . In particular , small islands located near a large coastline can effectively " block " a larger coastal state from maritime space . An example of this is the continental shelf boundary between the coasts of France and the United Kingdom in the English Channel , which was delimited by an arbitral tribunal in 1977 . The tribunal found that a strict equidistance line would have left France with only a small portion of maritime space along its coast because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast of Normandy . Thus , the tribunal established the boundary along the equidistance line between the two mainland coasts within the English Channel , and " enclaved " the Channel Islands within the French territorial sea ( See Figure 3 ) . ( n50 ) <p> In many cases , both in international jurisprudence and state practice , circum stances have caused maritime boundaries to be shifted or adjusted from the equidistance line , in order to achieve an " equitable solution . " Geographical factors , such as the position and size of offshore islands or the relative size and position of the opposing coastlines , have prompted shifting a maritime boundary away from the equidistance line . The International Court of Justice has also identified other conditions , including economic considerations such as oil license practices , which might warrant a boundary being shifted from the equidistance line in order to produce an equitable solution. ( n51 ) Other Methods of Delimitation <p> While the equidistance line often provides the starting point for delimitation , there are a variety of other methods for drawing maritime boundaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of turning points. ( n52 ) In some instances these turning points are eliminated to simplify the equidistance line , which usually results in the trading of small maritime areas . This is the case with the Pacific coast boundary between Mexico and the United States ( see Figure 4 ) . <p> Many existing maritime boundaries do not follow strict or adjusted equidistance lines at all . Lines of latitude and longitude have been utilized , as in the case of the maritime boundary between Angola and Namibia. ( n53 ) The continental shelf boundary between Ireland and the United Kingdom follows a complicated series of " stair-stepped " lines . These took into account existing oil concessions across the Irish Sea and also served to partly obscure which country had gained what in what was a politically sensitive negotiation process. ( n54 ) Joint Development Regimes <p> Pending agreement on a maritime boundary , UNCLOS calls for neighboring states to " make every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature and , during this transitional period , not to jeopardize or hamper the reaching of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this directive is the establishment of a joint development zone ( JDZ ) . In many cases , JDZs have been established along sections of a boundary in order to bypass disputed areas and reach an overall boundary agreement , as well as to facilitate offshore exploration . Examples of these can be found between Malaysia and Thailand , Iceland and Norway 's Jan Mayen Island , and Japan and South Korea. ( n56 ) When the full length of a potential boundary is disputed , some states have put in place a temporary JDZ covering the whole area . For example , Nigeria and Sao Tom e Principe established a large JDZ in the Gulf of Guinea . Although ostensibly JDZs can provide easy political solutions , they often require complex management regimes which can be as difficult to negotiate as a permanent boundary. ( n57 ) Unitization <p> Oil and gas fields that straddle maritime boundaries are common around the world . Such deposits have often been subject to unitization agreements by the neighboring states . These are different from JDZ in that a maritime boundary is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straddling field . A unitization agreement first defines the extent of the field or fields in question . The parties then decide together how exploration will be conducted ( usually by a single operating company ) and how the revenue from the field will be shared. ( n58 ) The first such arrangement was concluded between Norway and the United Kingdom in 1976 concerning the Frigg field straddling their maritime boundary in the North Sea , and most unitization agreements can be found in the North Sea. ( n59 ) However , more recently , Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea completed a unitization agreement for the Zafiro-Ekanga field in 2002. ( n60 ) This has been complicated to implement , and many of the specifics of the commercial arrangement have been kept confidential , but it is proving to be successful. ( n61 ) Most maritime boundary agreements since 1976 have included articles which commit the signatories to cooperating in the event that deposits spanning their boundary are discovered . For example , Article 7 of the 2000 PRC Vietnam agreement on maritime boundary delimitation states : <p> In case that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit should straddle the demarcation line as provided in Article 2 of this Agreement , the Parties shall , through friendly consultation , reach an agreement on the development of the structure or deposit in a most effective way as well as on equal sharing of the profits resulting from the development. ( n62 ) <p> The prevalence of these clauses in boundary treaties may have set a precedent for states to cooperate over straddling deposits when a boundary has already been agreed , but obligations when there is no agreed boundary are less clear. ( n63 ) Masahiro Miyoshi believes that neighboring states have a general obligation to abstain from exploring in disputed areas : <p> The reason for this lies in the basic fact that extraction by a single state can deplete the fluid deposit in which the other adjacent states are entitled to shares.Pending agreement on such positive cooperation ( e.g. , unitization ) , there must be a negative form of cooperation to refrain from proceeding to a unilateral act of extraction. ( n64 ) <p> As the basis for this argument , Miyoshi cites Articles 74(3) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " jeopardize or hamper the reaching of the final agreement " on a maritime boundary , as well as Article 77(2) , which directs no state to undertake activities on another state 's continental shelf without approval . CURRENT MARITIME DISPUTES AND THEIR RESOLUTION : THE EAST CHINA SEA CASE <p> Currently , there are 61 active disputes involving overlapping claims to maritime areas . Of these , 34 involve disagreement over land or island territories . This includes 12 disputes over land territory , affecting the land boundary termini , and 22 disputes involving sovereignty over islands. ( n65 ) Of the active island disputes , only six concern islands of substantial size and/or population ( i.e. , those that have more than 500 inhabitants ) : the Falkland/Malvinas Islands ( Argentina/United Kingdom ) , Diego Garcia ( Mauritius/United Kingdom ) , the Kurile Islands/Northern Territories ( Japan/Russia ) , San Andres and Providencia Islands ( Colombia/Nicaragua ) , Mayotte Island ( France/Comoros ) and Abu Musa Island ( Iran/United Arab Emirates ) . The remaining 16 active island disputes concern small , uninhabited or sparsely inhabit ed islets whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their intrinsic worth than their ability to generate substantial areas of maritime jurisdiction . This is the case in the East China Sea , where disputed sovereignty of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands is inextricably linked to the maritime boundary situation . <p> Much of the recent tension in the East China Sea dispute can be understood as a direct result of the PRC decision to begin test-drilling for oil and gas in the Chunxiao field , which is located 160 nm north-northeast of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. ( n66 ) According to some reports , Chinese exploration is located 5 kilometers to the west of the equidistance line. ( n67 ) This is significant because although the exact extent of the field is unknown , indications show that it appears to straddle the equidistance line . Commentators differ on their estimates of when production will start in the Chunxiao field , but most agree that it will be some time in the second half of 2005 . Japan argues that this will lead to the PRC eventually siphoning off what little natural gas resources exist under Japanese territory. ( n68 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years and has made numerous claims about the size of the deposit . However , neither side has sought to share information on this , which seems to contradict " the spirit of understanding and cooperation " in Articles 74(3) and 83(3) . Speaking earlier this year , a " scholar from Peking University and two scholars from Tsinghua University " stated that " oil fields on both sides of the median line claimed by Japan but disputed by the PRC could provide eight decades of oil and gas . " ( n69 ) In particular : <p> Reserves under the Okinawa Trench and the 22,000-square-kilometer Chunxiao fields are being explored by the PRC west of the median line . The nearby Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands.could yield oil as well , said Liu Jiangyong , vice director of Tsinghua 's International Issues Research Institute .. . Natural gas fields in the disputed area will yield about 7.7 billion tons he said. ( n70 ) <p> These declarations are problematic , especially in light of the recent withdrawal of Unocal and Shell from the region , with both companies citing poor test-drilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Recently , Japan has increased the tension regarding the significance of these supposed oil reserves by announcing in the spring of 2005 that it too would begin test-drilling on " its side " of the median line. ( n72 ) Indeed , the Japanese government has awarded rights to the Japanese company Teikoku Oil to begin test-drilling in an area covering 400 square kilometers just to the east of the equidistance line. ( n73 ) <p> In the East China Sea , the PRC seeks a maritime boundary along the outer edge of the continental shelf  --  at the Okinawa Trough  --  while Japan argues for the equidistance line . The matter is further complicated by the tensions over the contested maritime boundary the islands and the oil field-all of which seem to have become interlinked in the two countries ' rhetoric . In fact , the Chunxiao field appears to lie slightly to the north of the maritime area affected by the sovereignty dispute , so it could be argued that there is no direct connection between the two issues. ( n74 ) However , the PRC 's claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated on its claimed continental shelf , which thus inextricably links these three issues . Indeed , if the PRC agrees to a maritime boundary over the Chunxiao area that is anything other than the natural prolongation of its continental shelf , it will erode its claim to these islands . In the case of the maritime boundary , the PRC appears to have little hope of sustaining a natural prolongation argument . While boundaries based on seabed geomorphology were in vogue during the 1960s and 1970s , the International Court of Justice has ruled out geomorphology as a relevant factor in boundary delimitation between coasts that are less than 400 nm apart. ( n75 ) Thus , on paper , Japan seems to have the stronger case . This will inevitably influence both parties ' willingness to submit to any form of dispute resolution process . Maritime Dispute Resolution <p> There are several types of maritime boundary resolution open to disputing parties . Given the current level of tension between China and Japan , with all the rhetoric and posturing this entails , it seems unlikely that the East China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the near future . However , this should not preclude examining possible forms of maritime boundary dispute resolution that could be employed in this case . Recently , a BBC News report stated that the dispute would be settled through UN arbitration by 2009. ( n76 ) However , we have found no supporting evidence for this claim , and indeed the public statements of the PRC and Japan seem to run counter to it . In a recent press conference , a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the PRC commented : <p> Disputes do exist between China and Japan concerning the demarcation in the East China Sea . We hope that Japan can proceed from the general interests of the bilateral relationship and refrain from taking any actions that may complicate the situation. ( n77 ) <p> There are a number of accepted mechanisms for resolving maritime boundary disputes . While it is desirable for disputes to be resolved through bilateral negotiation , states can also choose to have a mediator facilitate dialogue , without making formal recommendations or binding decisions . Alternatively , the parties can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that would include recommendations for settlement . These recommendations are not binding unless the states agree to accept them . As a last resort , states can submit a dispute to binding third-party adjudication . <p> There are three main institutions for binding third-party settlement of maritime boundary disputes . The first is the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , which has adjudicated many maritime boundary cases in its history and currently has three such cases on its docket. ( n78 ) Second , UNCLOS established a standing tribunal to deal with any disputes arising from application of the convention . The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ( ITLOS ) was established in 1994 , but it has yet to receive a request to rule on a maritime boundary case . There is also some question as to whether or not ITLOS has jurisdiction to rule on issues relating to territorial sovereignty , such as disputes over islands . Third , under the auspices of UNCLOS , states can choose to establish an ad hoc arbitral tribunal to adjudicate their dispute . Arbitral tribunals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dispute , which must agree on the make-up and procedures of the tribunal . Furthermore , for third-party adjudication to take place , both states have to be subject to the jurisdiction of the court or tribunal in question . States can choose to accept the jurisdiction of a specific court or tribunal and submit their dispute jointly , or one party can forcibly bring the other to arbitration if it can be established that both states are under the jurisdiction of the court in question . <p> Regarding the first option for adjudication , under the statute of the ICJ , member states of the United Nations can issue a declaration , commonly known as the " optional clause declaration , " in which they accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ for resolving their disputes . States are authorized at any time to amend or repeal these declarations and to attach reservations to them , such as excluding specific disputes from ICJ jurisdiction. ( n79 ) Prior to the Communist Revolution , the Republic of China made an optional clause declaration , without reservations , on 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 5 December 1972 to the UN secretary-general , the PRC refused to recognize the 1946 declaration , considering it defunct . Japan issued its own declaration on 15 September 1958 , accepting compulsory ICJ jurisdiction for all its disputes , with the one reservation that this jurisdiction would not apply in the event that Japan and the other party had already referred the dispute to another forum for binding " arbitration or judicial settlement . " ( n81 ) This declaration remains valid today . Therefore , the PRC could forcibly bring Japan before the ICJ , but it would be difficult for Japan to do the same to the PRC . <p> As for the UNCLOS mechanisms , states that are parties to the convention have an obligation under Article 279 to settle their maritime disputes through peaceful means . If a settlement can not be reached through negotiation , parties to UNCLOS should submit their dispute to one of several procedures for binding arbitration , as per Part XV of UNCLOS , including : the ICJ , ITLOS or an arbitral tribunal to be created under Annex VII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted to arbitral tribunals created under Annex VII : Barbados v. Trinidad and Tobago , and Guyana v. Suriname. ( n82 ) Parties to UNCLOS can also make declarations that exclude them from these dispute settlement obligations . The PRC made the following declaration when it ratified UNCLOS on 7 June 1996 : <p> The People 's Republic of China will effect , through consultations , the delimitation of the boundary of the maritime jurisdiction with the States with coasts opposite or adjacent to China respectively on the basis of international law and in accordance with the principle of equitability. ( n83 ) <p> It is unclear if this declaration excludes the PRC from compulsory dispute settlement . As for Japan , it has not made any declarations regarding UNCLOS. ( n84 ) Past Agreements <p> The PRC and Japan have each settled one respective maritime boundary dispute with neighboring states . These agreements reveal that both states have exercised patience and flexibility in resolving disputes in the past . After complex negotiations dating back to the early 1970s , the PRC and Vietnam signed an agreement delimiting their maritime boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay ) on 25 December 2000 . The agreement delimited a single territorial sea and continental shelf boundary and established a large common fishing area on either side of the continental shelf boundary . Details of the cooperative fishing regime continued to be negotiated for another three and a half years , so the agreement did not come into force until 30 June 2004 . Ted L. McDorman observed that " the line accepted by the two states in the Gulf of Tonkin is a product of obvious compromise , creativity and the result of pragmatic considerations . " ( n85 ) <p> Japan and South Korea signed a maritime boundary agreement in January 1974 that entered into force in June 1978 . Because of their dispute in the Sea of Japan/East Sea over the Liancourt Rocks , known as Takeshima in Japan and Tokdo in Korea , this agreement only delimited a boundary through the Tsushima/Korea Strait for approximately 260 nm. ( n86 ) The boundary basically follows the equidistance line through the strait , but farther to the south the two states had a significant area of overlapping claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil crises of the early 1970s encouraged the two states to reach an agreement in order to begin offshore exploration in the area . A complex joint development zone , the first of its kind , was established in the area of overlapping claims , measuring over 24,000 square nautical miles. ( n87 ) The JDZ was divided into nine sections a joint commission to implement the complicated regime . However , since its creation in 1978 , no significant oil or gas deposits have been reported found in the Japan-South Korea JDZ . The PRC has persistently refused to recognize this zone , maintaining that it encroaches on its own continental shelf claims. ( n88 ) <p> These examples demonstrate willingness on the part of both the PRC and Japan to settle maritime boundary disputes outside of formal resolution procedures through extensive dialogue and ingenuity . However , in both instances the parties failed to deal with disputed islands . Japan and South Korea did not delimit their boundary north of the Korea Strait because of the disputed Liancourt Rocks. ( n89 ) Similarly , the PRC and Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonkin because of the disputed Paracel Islands , located southeast of the PRC 's Hainan Island . CONCLUSION <p> In this paper we have illustrated the complex nature of maritime boundary-making and the problems associated with resolving disputes related to them , using the case of the PRC and Japan as an example . Given the current tensions between the two countries over their disputed maritime boundary and the Senkaku/Diaoyu situation , there seems little chance of a swift resolution to the impasse in the East China Sea . Although many options and precedents do exist for settlement of the boundary dispute-and precedents exist in the form of the Gulf of Tonkin and Korea Straits agreements-neither country seems willing , at present , to seek any form of third-party adjudication through the ICJ , ITLOS or an arbitral tribunal . Regardless of any potential progress on this front , the matter of sovereignty is likely to continue to remain an issue . A complete resolution of the tensions in the East China Sea , how ever , will only be achieved through efforts to reach agreements on both the maritime boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
