I awoke with a start in almost complete darkness . I did n't know where I was . The mattress was too soft . I reached over to get my watch but the night table was n't there . I almost fell off the lawn chair onto the porch . Then I remembered how hot it was in the house . The kids , Jesus and Feather , had taken the only working fan to blow air from the window into Jesus 's room . I 'd come outside to the screened-in porch at two A.M. after waking up to find myself sweating in the bed . I sat up trying to throw off the nightmare . It had been almost five years , but Bruno died in my dreams at least once a month  --  more often recently . I 'll never forget him being nailed to the wall by my best friend 's gun . I tried to think of better things . About our new young Irish president and Martin Luther King ; about how the world was changing and a black man in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in hundreds of years . But that same world was being rocked almost daily by underground nuclear explosions and the threat of war . Across town an old friend of mine , Martin Smith , lay dying . He 'd been the closest thing to a teacher that I ever had . I knew that I had to go see him , to say goodbye , but I kept putting it off . And through it all blew that hot September wind . It would n't let me rest . It just got hotter and hotter while my temper wore thin . I wanted to feel better but all I had was the certainty that the world had passed me by  --  leaving me and my kind dead or making death in dark causeways . A strip of dawn light showed above the houses across the street . A better day might havebeen coming , for some people  --  but not for everyone . Bruno was in his grave almost five years now , while Mouse languished in the state prison at Chino for manslaughter . I was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prison of my mind . " Mr. Rawlins ? " a voice said . My hand went straight for the pistol in the night-table drawer again . But I was n't in my bedroom . I was naked , not even under a sheet , outside in the dark . I grabbed a ceramic ashtray that Jesus had made me at summer camp . " Whoisit ? " I tried to sound calm . The silhouette in the screened doorway was a man  --  somewhere between five foot six and six foot five . With my free hand I took the sheet from the floor and held it to my crotch . " Saul Lynx , Mr. Rawlins . " A white man . " Can you talk ? " " Huh ? What ? " I clutched the misshapen slab of clay so hard that it cracked in my hand . " I know it 's early , " the white man said . " But it 's important that I speak with you . I got your name last night , but by the time I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to wait outside until later , but when I came up to check the address I heard you talking in your sleep . You see , I have to talk to you this morning . " " Then why do n't you get-ass away from here and call me in the mornin ' ? " I could feel the strength in my arm build to the point where I could have hurled the ashtray through the screen . If he had touched the latch on the door he would have been a dead man . But instead of taking any chances he said , " I 've come to offer you a job . But you 've got to start today  --  this morning . " Then he said , " Can we turn on a light or something ? " I did n't want him to see me with no clothes on . It was like I was still in a dream , as if I were vulnerable if someone could see my skin . I wanted to linger in those shadows , but I 'd learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody knows where you live you 've got to stand up . I wrapped the sheet around me like an African robe and reached inside the front door to switch on the porch light . Mr. Lynx was still hidden in the faint light beyond my screen . " May I come in ? " he asked . " Come on then . " He was a smallish man in a light brown cotton suit and a loose dark brown tie . His nose was the only big thing on him  --  protruding and somehow shapeless . If you 'd forgotten his name you would have said , " You know , the guy with the nose . " His cap was brown . He had on a white shirt to go with his pale skin . His eyes were brilliant green . Saul Lynx smiled and bobbed his head , but I did n't take his hand . " You wo n't be needing that . " He was looking down at the ashtray . " I do n't blame you for sleeping outside on a night like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy I spent more time on the fire escape than I did in the apartment . " " What do you want , man ? " I did n't have patience for his small talk . " Like I say , " he answered , unperturbed , " I 've got a job for you . There 's a woman missing and it 's my client 's desire to find her quickly . " The shadow of night was lifting from Genesee Avenue . I could make out the shapes of large carob trees across the street and the neat little lawns of my neighbors . " Can we sit down ? " Saul Lynx wanted to know . " Say what you got to say , man , and then get outta here . " I had children in the house and did n't want this stranger too comfortable in their home . Saul Lynx had a smile that was just about as sincere as the kind of grin the undertaker puts on a corpse . " Have you ever heard of a woman named Elizabeth Eady ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of my mind . It fit with the humid September heat  --  and with my dreams . " She 's lived in L.A. for almost twenty-five years , but she 's from Houston originally , " the little man was saying . " From down in your old neighborhood , I think . The only picture I have of her is this one . " Lynx handed me an old brittle photograph . Its colors were rose-brown and tan instead of black and white . It was n't a posed portrait , but a kind of snapshot . A young woman on the front porch of a small house . She was smiling at the time , leaning awkwardly against the doorjamb . She was tall and big-boned and very dark , even the rose coloring could n't hide Betty 's blackness . Her mouth was open as if she were smiling and flirting with the photographer . It brought a sense of intimacy that few amateur photographs have . Intimacy but not warmth . Black Betty was n't your warm sort of homemaking girl . Betty was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake . If you heard that a friend of yours was courting Betty you could start crying then , because he was bound to come to harm . She had something about her that drove men wild . And she was n't stingy with her charms . If a man could afford her supper , and her drink , she was happy to be with him . She 'd go out with him on Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday nights  --  all night . Betty was n't the kind who sat home , so if Friday came and his pockets were empty  --  Betty was gone . Because when the sun went down , Betty and Marlon ( Marlon , that was Betty 's fancy half brother ) , they hit the streets . And if one man could n't pay , another one was happy to take his place . Back then there were n't too many of your colored men who could afford a steady diet of Betty . Many a night , yesterday 's boyfriend went up against tonight 's man . Betty could draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever bothered her she never let it show . I had seen her sashaying down the wooden sidewalks of Houston 's Fifth Ward . I was a raggedy twelve-year-old and she was more woman than I had ever seen in one place . She wore black lace , gloves , and fur and smelled so good that I forgot who I was . It was out in front of a bar called Corcheran 's on Blanford Street . I guess I was looking pretty hard , my nostrils were probably flared out too . " What you lookin ' at , boy ? " she asked me . " You , ma'am . " " You like what you see ? " I had to swallow before saying , " Uh-huh , yes 'm . You ' bout the prettiest woman I ever seen . " " About ? " I was crushed . I should have said the prettiest . She was the prettiest . I had ruined my chances of her ever talking to me again . " Come on , honey , " her date said . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  right on the lips . She pushed her tongue out but I was too slow to open my own mouth . When she pulled back from me I fell on the ground from leaning into the embrace that did n't come . They all laughed at me , all the men standing outside . But Betty did n't laugh . She was moved by her power over me . I would have fallen down for her any day . I would have jumped out of a window for her kiss . " Do you know her , Mr. Rawlins ? " Saul Lynx asked . Dawn had come while I studied the picture . A car drove by and tossed a newspaper onto my lawn and the lawn next door . Almost immediately a spidery white woman came out of her house to retrieve her paper . Mrs. Horn was insomniac and impatient . She 'd probably been waiting for hours just to get the news . " I do n't remember her , " I said . " Well ... " He took a long time with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to believe me or not . " That does n't matter , not really . You 're known for finding people in the colored part of town . That 's why we need you . " " Who 's we ? " " I 'm the only one you need to be concerned with . " " What 's she done ? " " Nothing as far as I know . She worked for a woman almost the whole time she 's been up here . But something happened . Miss Eady quit and left her job and now her boss wants her to come on back . " Saul Lynx smiled and caressed his nose like it was a favored pet . " She did n't leave a forwarding address and there 's no Elizabeth Eady in the book . " " Who she work for ? " " I 'm not at liberty to say . " " Uh-huh . And how much you payin ' t'find her ? " " Two hundred dollars now and another two hundred when you find her . " He pointed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be done quickly . From what I understand , the woman who 's paying is very upset and wants to find Miss Eady soon . " " From what you understand ? " " Well , you see , " he said , almost apologetically , " I have n't actually met the woman . She does n't deal with dicks . It 's her lawyer who hired me . " He took a small fold of bills from his pants pocket and handed it in my general direction . I had the ashtray in one hand and the picture in the other . " Two hundred dollars up front , " he said . It was more than I had in the bank . At one time I was flush with the income from apartment buildings I owned . I 'd bought them with a windfall I 'd come upon in 1948 . But since then I 'd stretched myself pretty thin trying to make it in the real estate game . I was almost bankrupt . The house I lived in was rented . We ate beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down the ashtray and took the bills . They were damp from being in his pants . " I might look , " I said tentatively . " But I 'll want to talk to this lawyer guy myself before I give you anything I find . What you say his name was ? " " We 'll talk about that when you 've got something . I 'll let him know that you 'll be wanting to see to him , though . " He could n't have cared less about what I wanted . " How can he get in touch with you if he wants to talk ? " I told him my number and he nodded . Mr. Lynx was the kind of man who did n't write things down . " How did you find me , Mr. Lynx ? My address ai n't in no book . " " You 're famous , Mr. Rawlins . " He took a cracked leather wallet from his back pocket . From this he produced a creased and soiled business card . It was damp too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed in black letters that had run slightly with the moisture . There was n't a name , though . " That 's L-Y-N-X , " he said . " Call me when you find something . And call me soon . " " How do you know that I wo n't just take this money and say you owed it to me for somethin ' ? " Saul Lynx looked me in the eye and stopped his placid smiling . " I might be wrong , but I bet that you 're the kind of man who does what he says , Mr. Rawlins . Anyway , there 's still two hundred dollars to be made . " " Well , maybe so , but how do you expect me to find this one woman outta two and a half million people ? You must have somethin ' t'tell me about her . " I already knew how to go about looking for Betty , but I wanted to know what that white man knew . And he saw what I was about . A smile that bordered on respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sorry , Mr. Rawlins , but all I know is that she has friends down in the Negro community . Maybe somebody you know will recognize her from the picture . " I would have given him the money back but I had an idea of how he found me  --  and an itch to see Betty when I was a man . " I 'll be talkin ' to ya , " I said . Lynx touched his forehead in a mock-friendly salute . " Do n't forget , " he said . " I have to know about this soon . " He smiled and walked out . I watched him get into an especially small and tinny brown car . It was something foreign , I never knew what . As he drove off Mrs. Horn came out  --  just curious , I suppose . When she saw me standing outside dressed in my toga her white face paled even more . I do n't know what she thought . I smiled and called to her but she was already hurrying back into her house . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia had just set off their third nuclear blast that month .
