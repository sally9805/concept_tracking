<p> More than a quarter of Americans spent some of their time lending a helping hand last year . <p> That good news kept the rate of nationwide volunteering at historically high levels : Some 61.2 million people dedicated 8.1 billion hours of service to schools ; hospitals ; and religious , political , and youth groups in 2006 , according to the Corporation for National &; Community Service ( CNCS ) . <p> The bad news is that the number of volunteers recently dipped significantly - by one third - from 2005 . <p> A key reason : Nonprofits and other groups that rely on volunteers are having trouble retaining them . <p> " The demographics are such that we are poised to make this 30-year high get even better because the baby-boom generation is passing the traditional age of retirement , " says David Eisner , CEO of CNCS . The group aims to raise the number of adult volunteers to 75 million by 2010 . <p> " At the same time , " he says , " our work is cut out for us because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We get a lot each year , but we lose a lot each year . We have to figure out how to plug those holes . " Commuting time , education , and home ownership all play roles in determining how much time people are likely to spend helping organizations that need support , according to the CNCS 's national study of America 's top 50 cities based on census data between 2004 and 2006 . <p> Cities ' volunteering rates vary <p> For example , in Minneapolis , where home ownership is high and neighbors stay connected , volunteerism is nearly 41 percent . <p> But in Los Angeles , where people spend more time alone in their cars than talking over the back fence , volunteerism is about 22 percent . <p> In Portland , Ore. , where almost 90 percent of residents over age 25 have completed high school , the volunteer rate is nearly 36 percent . <p> In Riverside , Calif. , where only 75 percent of people over age 25 have a high school degree , the number of folks willing to help for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate in one of four types of activities : fundraising , serving food , general labor - including highway maintenance and construction - and tutoring . But more groups that rely on volunteers say they are having a hard time keeping many who sign up . <p> " Our surveys show that the biggest hurdle to getting a volunteer to stay involved is that they felt ineffective in their use of time , " says Rob Wallace , a spokesman for Keep America Beautiful , a national nonprofit public education organization that seeks to improve community environments . " Everyone is extremely busy today , so if they begin to feel their volunteer time is sucking the life out of them without giving them satisfaction , they get jaded and want to quit . " <p> Often this happens because volunteer programs are not being run effectively , experts say . <p> " Most nonprofits ... if they got a million dollar grant , they would put their CEO in charge of it , " says Sandy Scott , spokesman for CNCS . " But at the same time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are being run by an intern or busy receptionist . We are trying to change that . " <p> More groups are now teaching nonprofit organizations how to help guarantee volunteer satisfaction in part by working with their busy schedules . <p> " We help them plan flexible projects for times that volunteers have free , or in geographical areas where they are already commuting to or that deal with such facts such as they do n't have much money to get around , " says Ariel Zwang , executive director of New York Cares , which helps 850 nonprofit agencies , public schools , and others create projects for volunteers . <p> Some states , like Minnesota , have an association of volunteer administrators , who provide training of volunteer leaders . " We have an actual infrastructure here that supports volunteerism , which other states do n't , " says Bob Jackson , who is CNCS 's Minnesota state director . <p> Why some areas have higher rates <p> The levels of local , state , and federal financial commitment are key to making a city work well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't happen in a vacuum , " says Shawn Lecker-Pomaville , executive director of the Nevada Commission for National and Community Service , which administers AmeriCorps programs . " It takes resources and oversight and management and public policies to support it . This state could do a lot more . " <p> In the CNCS study , Las Vegas was ranked the lowest among the top 50 cities , having a volunteering rate of 14 percent . <p> It 's crucial to develop a culture of connectedness , too . " Here in the Midwest , helping each other is just something we do , " says Beth Erickson , a business consultant in suburban Minneapolis who volunteers at least twice a week at her church in St. Paul . " I have long surmised that we volunteer up here on the frozen tundra because our lives quite literally can depend on it , " she says . <p> Compassion fatigue <p> Compassion fatigue is one reason Dr. Erickson believes volunteerism has dropped . <p> " Our nightly news is riddled with very few good news stories . Wars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only weary but also wary of others . So a " bunker mentality " has developed , where people keep to themselves and do n't worry about anything but insulating themselves from the world and the latest bad news . We simply have to turn that around , " she says . <p> People must constantly remind others that one person can make a big difference , says Cathy Lanyard , executive director of American Friends of Alyn Hospital in New York . <p> " Each person has to know that good begets good , " she says . " There was that movie called , ' Pay it Forward ' about one person doing one good thing for someone else . It 's not brain surgery . It 's as easy as tipping over a domino .
