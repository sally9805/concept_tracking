In Golden Blood By Stephen Woodworth Random House Stephen Woodworth 1 A Death in the Andes As he did every morning , Nathan Azure rose at dawn , dressed , and shaved in the musty canvas confines of his private tent , scrutinizing the aristocratic severity of his Mayfair face in a travel mirror to make certain that not a whisker remained and that every strand of blond hair was in its proper place . He then opened the carved wooden box next to his cot and selected a pair of leather driving gloves from the dozens of pairs inside . Although he wore gloves as a matter of habit , he donned these with especial care , like a surgeon wary of infection . He had not touched another human being 's skin , nor allowed his to be touched , in more than a decade . Seated on the edge of his cot , Azure idled away half an hour skimming Prescott 's History of the Conquest of Peru , lingering over passages that he had long ago committed to memory-those that described the abundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extorted from the Inca people , who tried in vain to purchase the release of their leader Atahualpa . A king 's ransom , indeed . Azure 's gloves made it awkward for him to turn the pages , however , and he soon tossed the book aside . After snatching the .45 automatic from beneath his pillow , he chambered a round and shoved the gun barrel-down into the hollow of his back between the waist of his slacks and his oxford shirt . He put on a cream-colored linen jacket to cover the butt of the pistol and stalked out of the tent . Outside , the Andean air , thin and crisp , pricked the inside of Azure 's windpipe , as if he 'd inhaled a handful of asbestos . The sun had yet to ascend above an adjacent peak to the east , leaving the mountains in a pall of predawn gray . Nevertheless , the camp already bristled with activity , Peruvian laborers bustling to and fro with spades and sifters , men delicately brushing dust off bits of broken metal and stone at makeshift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accurate enough to fool an expert . Or one expert , to be precise . It was all a sham . Azure had bought the artifacts at auction and then planted them on this Andean slope . The Peruvians he 'd assembled to pose as his assistants were actually mercenaries-some of them former Shining Path terrorists , others drug runners from the Huallaga Valley cocaine trade . Men whose loyalty Azure could purchase and whose silence he could ensure . Men to whom all work , whether menial labor or murder , was the same , as long as it paid well . Not unlike the conquistadors themselves . The performance was proceeding as scheduled , but the audience-the expert for whom Azure had created this mock expedition-was missing . It seemed that Dr. Wilcox , the only true archaeologist on the site , had chosen to sleep in . The closer Azure drew to his prize , the more impatient he became with delay . Intent on hastening today 's drama to its climax , he made his way down the path his crew had cleared in the spiky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground leveled off for a few feet , the haphazard tent encampment formed a terraced village of canvas and plastic , with Azure 's large shelter at the hill 's summit . At its base , a medium-size tent rested near the edge of a precipice , where the mountainside abruptly plunged into the valley below . Clouds blanketed the dell , a comfortable illusion that hid the screaming descent . A bearded thirty-something man in a creased white dress shirt and chinos sat in a director 's chair outside this last tent , head bent over a book , legs crossed as if he were lounging at a Parisian cafe . He must have sensed Azure 's approach , though , for he slapped the book shut and hopped to his feet before the Englishman arrived at the tent 's entrance . A gringo like his boss , he differed from Azure in nearly every other respect : his hair and complexion dark instead of fair , his face broad rather than narrow , his manner expansive , not calculated . " Looks like I got up before you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling . He smiled a lot-a monkey appeasing an alpha male . " Researching my role . See ? " Conqueror and Conquered : Pizarro and Peru read the title copy above an artist 's rendering of a composite face-half Pizarro , the other half Atahualpa , the Inca leader he overthrew and executed . Below the dual portrait was the author 's name : Dr. Abel Wilcox . Nathan Azure did not smile . He never smiled . " There 'll be plenty of time for that on the plane , Trent , " he commented in a clipped Cambridge accent . " Do you have the cuirass ? " With exaggerated flair , Trent snapped his fingers at one of the nearby laborers , who hurried up with a mud-encrusted , rust-stained breastplate in his hands . The men had done an admirable job of simulating centuries of exposure to the elements . The armor had been polished to a museum-ready sheen when Azure had obtained it from an underground " antiquities dealer " in Lima-a glorified fence for grave robbers and artifact thieves . Azure noted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revealing the ornate engraving of a family crest . He registered his satisfaction by withholding criticism . " What about Wilcox ? " Trent glanced at the tent behind him , shrugged . " Still asleep . " " Wake him . " Trent smiled again and pulled his own pair of leather gloves out of the back pocket of his pants . He put them on and ducked under the black plastic flap that served as the tent 's door . A drowsy grumble came from inside , followed by the shuffle and clatter of hasty activity . A few minutes later , Trent emerged with a man who could easily have been his brother . The latter stood an inch or two taller and lacked Trent 's muscular development , but they shared the same almond-shaped eyes , high forehead , and dark widow 's peak . Trent had grown the full black beard to downplay the resemblance , but it was not a coincidence ; Azure had chosen Trent for his appearance as much as for his acting skills and had even insisted on certain . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had demonstrated exceptional dedication to his craft , doggedly researching his role during the months it took his face to heal from the surgery . Even now , he eyed the professor with avid attention , taking advantage of his last opportunity to observe his subject . " Good morning , Dr. Wilcox , " Azure greeted the second man . " I trust you slept well . " " Until now . " A day 's growth of whiskers darkened the archaeologist 's face , the fly of his jeans was only half-buttoned , and his untied bootlaces trailed in the dust . He put on a pair of oval spectacles and scowled at Azure . " I hope you have something worth getting up for this time . " " Perhaps . " Azure thought of the string of worthless daggers , swords , coins , and other flotsam he 'd tossed in front of Wilcox like a trail of bread crumbs over the past month , gradually luring him to this remote Andean peak . " We just found this piece , and it seems promising-very promising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . " He held a gloved hand toward the cuirass , which the impassive laborer still held . Wilcox sniffed dubiously and glanced at the breastplate as if scanning the headlines of the morning paper . As he moved close enough to see the crest inscribed on it , his expression flared with stifled excitement-a prospector afraid that the mother lode he 's discovered is actually fool 's gold . He shot a look at Azure . " Where did you find this ? " Azure 's face remained as immobile as a bas-relief . He asked questions , he did n't answer them . " Is it genuine ? " Wilcox pushed his glasses higher up on his nose , bent forward , and squinted at the armor 's insignia . " Well ? Is it his ? " The archaeologist 's silence rankled . Azure knew at least as much about Peruvian history as this ivory-tower effete , and yet . . . had he been wrong about the cuirass ? Had he blown a million quid on a clever forgery ? If he had n't wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have put up with Wilcox this long . Although Nathan Azure would never admit it , he needed to commandeer the man 's knowledge as much as his identity . The archaeologist did not respond directly to Azure 's questions . Instead , he pointed to the design on the breastplate , mumbling as if to himself . " The family escutcheon . . . but with the black eagle and twin pillars of the royal arms . And here : an Indian city and a llama . Charles the Fifth 's seal of approval for the Peruvian conquest . " " But is it his ? " Azure pressed . " Could one of his men have worn it ? " Wilcox shook his head , voice quavering . " Pizarro would n't have allowed anyone else to wear it . " " Then we can use it to summon him ? " " Yes . " The archaelogist straightened . " You have a Violet ? " Azure 's face returned to its dour placidity , the closest he ever came to expressing pleasure . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all American conduits were controlled by the N-double-A-C-C , " Wilcox said , using the popular acronym for the North American Afterlife Communications Corps . " Not all . " Azure pictured the photos he 'd collected of Natalie Lindstrom , the classical contours of her visage turned skeletal by her scalp , which she kept shaved so that electrodes attached to her head could detect the presence of the souls that occupied her brain . Like all conduits for the dead , she had violet eyes , weary yet intense . She was the only Violet he could find who was not in the employ of one government or another , and Nathan Azure was eager to avoid attracting the attention of any government . Even Lindstrom , he knew , was monitored by the NAACC , but it would take the Corps a while after her disappearance to figure out where she 'd gone-long enough for Azure 's purposes . To avoid wasting time , he had decided not to bring her to Peru until he possessed a genuine touchstone for her to summon Pizarro . Now that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist him . Especially after good Dr. Wilcox helped draw her here to these isolated Peruvian peaks . A pity the archaeologist would never get to meet the Violet . . . at least , not until Azure had finished with her . " If you 're right about Pizarro 's gold , this could be the biggest find since King Tut . " Wilcox 's words grew heavy with a kind of lust . He did not appear to notice the two Peruvian workers who flanked him from behind , gloved hands clenched into fists . " Everyone 's going to want a piece of it . Customs , the Peruvian government-everyone . " " I agree . That 's why they must n't find out about it . " With a shift of his eyes , Azure signaled the men , who seized the archaeologist 's arms . Wilcox wriggled in their grasp , more from astonishment than fear . Then he laughed . " You ca n't be serious . " When Azure did n't smile , the archaeologist 's own grin failed . " I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . I 'll tell them all about you . " Azure sniffed to indicate his amusement . " You 're under the mistaken impression that I care . " He pulled the .45 from the small of his back and emptied it into Wilcox 's chest . The impact of the shots threw the archaeologist backward , but the men holding his arms kept his body from falling . Wilcox lifted his head , gurgling and hacking as if struggling to utter a final curse . " Madre Maria , " one of the superstitious Peruvians gasped . In the instant before they dropped him , Wilcox spat in Nathan Azure 's face . " Bastard ! " Azure recoiled , dropping the gun and slapping at the viscous spittle on his cheek . A film of crimson mucus smeared the palm of his driving glove , and he tore it off his hand and flung it in the dust at his feet , nearly doubling over with nausea . He 'd gone to great lengths to avoid establishing any quantum connection with Wilcox , but now the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lichen . He 'd have to keep that dead-talker Lindstrom from touching him , or Wilcox 's spirit might ruin everything . The Peruvians laid out the bleeding corpse while Trent rushed up to put his gloved hand on Azure 's shoulder . " You okay , boss ? " Azure swatted his hand away . " Do n't touch me ! " He pointed at the dead archaeologist . " Find his passport . Then get rid of him and everything else he came in contact with . We 're moving camp by nightfall . " Trent essayed a grin , but his Method technique failed to conceal his unease . Azure staggered away from him , compulsively wiping his contaminated cheek . As commanded , Trent and the other men gathered everything Abel Wilcox had touched-his tent , his bedroll , his books and notes , his campfire cookware-and tossed it all over the cliff 's edge into the valley below . Last of all , they pitched the body itself off the mountain . Before it dropped beneath the cloud cover , the drifting limbs of the corpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to take flight . They never heard the body hit ground . 2 Wolves at the Door Natalie Lindstrom did not recognize the corps Security agent who followed her to the movie theater that May afternoon : a man not much taller than she , of Southeast Asian Indian extraction , with slick black hair and sideburns . His gray suit seemed to blend chameleonlike into whatever background he passed . She sighed and pretended not to notice him as she purchased her ticket , for which she used one of the few credit cards she had n't already maxed out . The N-double-A-C-C must be having higher turnover these days , she thought . They must also have instructed their people against becoming overly familiar with the Violets they were ordered to intimidate , for the new agents never spoke to her . She actually became nostalgic for the days when she at least knew the names of the three agents assigned to her : George Langtree , Arabella Madison , and Horace Rendell . George used to share pizza and gossip with Natalie during his surveillance shift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the serial killer Vincent Thresher . George had since quit Corps Security , while Rendell had evidently been killed by Thresher when the murderer kidnapped Callie . That left Madison , catty fashion diva , as the only agent Natalie knew personally . But there was one advantage to having these nameless rookies following her : they did n't know her tricks as well as the veterans and so were easier to lose when necessary . Chameleon Man proved no exception . Natalie waited until the theater had lowered the house lights , then took her seat during a scene when the screen went dark to make it difficult for the agent to see where she was .
