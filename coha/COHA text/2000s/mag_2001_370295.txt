When the Census released its latest snapshot of the American family last week , some pundits described the picture as " alarming " and " disturbing , " not the kind you 'd want to paste into your favorite album . The American family is changing  --  shifting away from a traditional nuclear structure toward a variety of reconfigurations , and a big reason is a 25% increase since 1990 in the number of single mothers raising children . ( The number of single fathers raising children is also up  --  a whopping 62%  --  although they are still vastly outnumbered by single mothers . ) And for the first time , the number of traditional families  --  a married mom and pop with children  --  has fallen below 50% of all family households . <P> I 've played a part in the disturbing statistics . When my daughter and I sat down at the kitchen table last year to fill out the Census form , we reported as one of the 7.2% of American households headed by a single mother . I 've been a single mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now that the numbers are out , the backlash has begun . We are dysfunctional . Our home is broken . We are at risk and vulnerable . America is going to hell in a handbasket , and we are holding the basket  --  confounding the eternal American happy snapshot of what a family is supposed to look like . <P> But here is what it is like on the inside . On the inside , this family feels whole . It feels as if it works . My single parenthood is probably like the experience of millions of others  --  we have kids , pets , homes , jobs and ex-spouses in our lives . When we say , " Hi , honey , I 'm home , " it is to the baby sitter , the neighbor or a relative who has come over to help with child care . We do n't go out much . We do n't travel much . We cobble together work , meals and outside activities . Financially , we do n't do as well as married parents , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marriage to tend , we give our children all our energy , and much prefer their company to the occasional blind dates we force ourselves to go on . We do n't like the way bitterness tastes in the back of our mouth , so we swallow it . <P> My closest friend is also a single mother , with two children . Together we 've formed a new kind of extended family that takes up the slack left by our collective losses . I go to her children 's football games and band concerts . She comes to my daughter 's plays and piano recitals . On Sundays we get together for a family dinner . Sometimes her ex-husband joins us . We play games and music . We talk about school , sports and movies . I take my friend 's son out for driving lessons in my jalopy . My friend challenges my daughter to a game of badminton . We watch home movies together , and when I see my dear friend 's kids as toddlers , I have a hard time believing that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera lens . We watch each other 's back , lend each other money and love each other 's kids . <P> Even though we 're single , we do n't feel alone , and even though our families may be somewhat " bent , " they hardly feel " broken . " Yet , we note , whenever people talk about " family values , " they 're not talking about us . But come by on Sunday nights and take a look at our rickety family  --  the one pieced together from leftovers  --  and it will seem as healthy , happy and " normal " as any in the " married with children " column in the Census .
