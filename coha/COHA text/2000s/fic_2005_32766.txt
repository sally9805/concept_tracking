Chapter One The horseman reined in at a side road and looked at the fields stretching to the east . The rider was massively built , but he sat the war-horse lightly despite his armor . He was wearing a gray cloak fastened with a bronze brooch worked in the figure of an eagle , loricated plate-segmented armor that was overlapped like the plates on a centipede 's back-steel greaves and bracers and a kilt made of straps of leather with iron plates riveted on the outside . Tied to the right side of his saddle was a large helmet with a narrow T slit in the front while on the left was a large wooden shield with iron rim and a boss worked in the figure of a stooping eagle . The armor , the bracers , the helmet and the shield were nicked and battered but well polished and maintained . His right hand rested loosely on his leg while the hook and clamp that substituted for a left hand held his reins . The device was decidedly out of character considering the tech base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curved prosthetic clamp with a sharpened inner blade . It looked as if it were made for cutting small limbs and would probably make opening bottles a treat . There was a small scar under his right eye and more scars could be seen scoring the skin of his right arm wherever the bracers did n't cover . Also tied to the saddle were a short sword in a scabbard and a large bow case . On the rear of the saddle there was a large pack , a blanket roll , a quiver of arrows and a bag of feed for the horse . Despite the size of the rider and the weight of the equipment , the horse bore the load with no sense of worry . It stamped after a moment , but that seemed more impatience than fatigue . The rider shushed at it and the horse settled down without another shiver . The rider , his panoply and the horse were all covered in a thick layer of dust . Despite the battered armor and weather-beaten look , the rider was a young man , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green eyes . It was hard to tell from his expression but he had just passed his nineteenth year . And a good bit of the fields he was looking at were his . They were being harvested in a late autumn Indian summer with the skies blue and warm above . On the far side of the large field two men were managing the take from a combination harvester . One drove the harvester while the other drove a wagon that was capturing the grain . The grain was short and as the ox-drawn harvester passed it left behind stubble and straw that was laid out in rows for baling . The rider paused , indecisively , then turned his horse into the field . The near end of the field had n't been harvested yet and the horse whickered at him until he paused to let it strip a mouthful of the grain . " Go ahead , Diablo , " the young man said , humorously . " Mike should n't begrudge it . " The harvester looked up at a shout from the man driving the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the grain but since their mouths were covered by feed bags they could n't emulate the horse . He said something to the man on the wagon then climbed down off the harvester and walked across the fields towards the rider . At that the rider pulled the horse 's head up with a word and tapped him into an easy trot . When he approached the other man he reined in and smiled . " ' I will feast my horse on the standing grain , ' " he said , then dismounted , hooking his reins onto the saddle to tell the horse to stay . " Herzer , " the harvester said with a smile , holding out his hand . " It 's good to see you , man . " " Good to see you , Mike , " the young man replied , clasping his friend 's forearm and gesturing with his hook at the fields . " Damn , you 've been working hard . " " Yeah , but it 's paying off , " Mike said , looking at his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I am , " Herzer admitted . " And I 'm glad to be home . But I 'm due for a tour at the Academy , so maybe I can chill there for a while . " " What do you have to learn ? " Mike asked . " What do you have to learn about farming ? " Herzer replied . " Lots . " " Yeah , same here . But Edmund 's talking about an instructor position . I figure I 'll be doing some research at the same time . Time to brush up on my ancient Greek . " " Makes sense , " Mike said , wiping at his brow . " What are we doing talking about this out here ? Let 's go up to the house . " " What about the field ? " Herzer asked . " It 'll keep , " Mike said . " The rain 's supposed to hold off for another couple of days and this is the last one I have to cut . I saved mine for last . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse to follow as they walked back towards the reaper . " I could scratch up enough capital to float a loan for the reaper , " Mike said . " I 've been harvesting half the fields in the valley the last month . And , yes , this is actually your field . " " That was n't what I meant and you know it , " Herzer said with a grin . " I would n't know the first damned thing about farming this place . " " Well , I 'm learning , " Mike admitted . " I 'm learning every day . " The helper had been watering and feeding the oxen during the break and he nodded at Mike and Herzer as they walked up . " Harry , this is Herzer Herrick , " Mike said . " Herzer this is Harry Wilson . He 's got a small farm down the river . " " I 've heard of you , " Harry replied , wiping his hand and shaking Herzer 's . " I 'm taking Herzer up to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then cross-fill . I 'll be back in a while . " " Okay , " Harry said , getting on the reaper and clucking the oxen into motion . " Slower that way , but it 'll get some of the field done , " Mike said . " You want a ride up to the house ? " Herzer asked , gesturing at the horse . " I can walk , " Mike replied gruffly . They strode up the side road towards a distant hill , passing through a screen of trees that was apparently kept as a windbreak . On both sides of the road , before and after the trees , there were fields . Some of them were ready for harvesting , in grain and corn , others had plants that were not quite ready for harvest and a few were apparently fallow . The latter were covered in an odd golden plant that looked like a weed . " Cover clover , " Mike said at a gesture from Herzer . " Very good for fixing nitrogen and it forms a ' standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter . " He gestured to one of the fields where low bushes were covered in purple-green berries . " Olive bushes . I 'm hoping to get a good crop of olives off them . " " I thought olives grew on trees , " Herzer said , fingering the eagle emblem at his throat . In the left talon it held a bundle of arrows and in the right an olive branch . The eagle 's screaming beak was pointed to the left . " They do . And the trees take decades , centuries really , to grow to maturity , " Mike said with a shrug . " These grow in a season and you can get more olives per acre than with trees . " " Seems like cheating , " Herzer grumbled . " You know why the olive is the symbol of peace ? " " No . " " Because it takes so long for the trees to grow . If you have olive trees it shows that armies have n't fought over the land in a long time . Take away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Great , but I 'm getting fifty chits a barrel for mature olives , " Mike said , with apparent grumpiness . " And I can get two crops a year off the bushes . Even with the cost of field hands and preparation I 'm getting ten- or elevenfold profits per season . So you can take your philosophical objections and stuff them . " Herzer laughed and pointed to a group of trees on the back side of the olive field . They were short and had broad glossy leaves that were a dark , rich green . " Rubber plants , " Mike replied . " I 'm trying them out . They 're supposed to be freeze resistant and fast growing . They grow fast , that 's for sure , but this is the first winter they 've been out so we 'll see how they do . " There was more . Growing fruit and nut orchards , stands of hay , partially cleared fields with cattle on them . Herzer pointed to the latter in question . " I got together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , " Mike said as they passed the last field . " That 's where I got the oxen , too . And you 've never lived until you 've tried to turn a feral bull into a plow-ox . " Herzer laughed again as they came in sight of the house . It was a low , log structure , rough in appearance but sturdy and well made . The barn to the side of it was much larger and made of a combination of logs and sawn wood . There were two or three other outbuildings as well . " Leave it to you to have a better barn than you do a house , " Herzer chuckled . " That 's what Courtney keeps saying , " Mike replied . " But we 're not made of money . " The woman in question came out the door as Herzer was loosening Diablo 's saddle . She was a short , buxom woman with fiery red hair and an open , smiling face . Having watched her negotiate , Herzer was well aware that that heart-shaped face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly sure the smile in this case was genuine . " Herzer , " she yelled , pulling her skirts away from the child at her side and running to the hitching post . " Where did you come from ? " " Harzburg , " he said , picking her up and kissing her on the cheek . As he did he noticed a decided roundness to her abdomen . " Got another one in the oven ? " " Yes , " she said with a tone of asperity . " This will make three . " " Three ? " he asked then nodded . " I had n't realized I 'd been gone that long . " " Little Daneh is in the crib , " she said , gesturing at the child that was still hiding by the door . " Mikey , come here . This is our friend Herzer . " The boy shook his head and then , as her face clouded up , darted in through the door . " I doubt he 's used to strangers in armor at his door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't get familiar with strangers in armor at his door . " " Trouble ? " Mike asked . " Not down here that I 've heard , " Herzer said . He finished loosening Diablo 's saddle and lifted all the gear off , then led the horse to the trough and tied him off . " That was why I was up in Harzburg . Tarson had been taken over by a band of brigands , for want of a better term . They had been raiding Harzburg and the city fathers requested federal help . They got me . " " That must have been a pleasure for them , " Mike said with a chuckle . " Yeah , they 'd requested a century of Blood Lords , as if we have a century of trained Blood Lords to send . And they had a militia but they 'd never founded a local Blood Lord chapter . Or even sent anyone to the Academy . So I got to go whip them into shape . " Herzer laid his saddle , tack and blanket on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slung it over his shoulder . " Lead on , Macduff ! " " How 'd it go ? " Courtney asked as they went in the house . She brought over a flagon and set it on the table , then laid out cold pork , cheese and bread . " Thank you , " Herzer said , taking a slice of the cheese . It was sharp and tangy and went well with a slice of the cold pork . " I 'd thought about eating on the road but I figured I 'd stop by and you might be willing to feed me something other than monkey on a stick . " " Not a problem . " She smiled , nibbling at the cheese herself . " And I repeat , how 'd it go ? " " Well , it was a little sticky to start , " Herzer admitted . " They 'd expected someone ... older . " Mike chuckled and shook his head . " You 've got the silver sword and the laurel of valor . " " Which meant just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a mouthful of cheese and bread . " So I just worked at it until they realized they could do it my way or die . I made it pretty clear I did n't care which . The Tarsons finally attacked the town , where we wiped out most of their fighters , then more or less walked in and took Tarson over . The leader of them had set up a ' citadel ' made of a free- standing stockade and a couple of log blockhouses . They burned quite nicely with the application of a little tallow and brush . " He frowned at the memory , then shook his head . " You make it sound easy , " Mike said . " Easy . Yeah . Only took me a year and a half . " Herzer shook his head again and took another bite of the pork . " Nice . So what 's been happening around here ? " " It 's been quiet , thank God , " Courtney replied . " We had a petroleum prospecting party through here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They sold some processed product to the Academy and we 've been experimenting with it . " " Doing what ? " Courtney asked . " Well , it burns a treat , " Herzer said , grimly . " Useful if we can figure out a way to get the burning stuff over there where the bad guys are , " he continued , pointing in a random direction . " There 's a device called a flamethrower that we 're working on . If we perfect it we 're going to have to figure out a new way to fight because it 's going to make tight formations suicidal , especially wearing armor . " " Ouch ! " Courtney said . She shook her head and changed the subject . " The town 's pretty much stopped growing . Hotrum 's Ferry has been drawing off a lot of people . We 're starting to sell a lot of produce down the river . " " Getting good prices for it , too , " Mike said . " They can ship it up river to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from Raven 's Mill . " " I hope they 've got decent defenses , " Herzer said . " Paul 's going to make a grab for Norau sooner or later . " " Well , that 's their beef , " Mike replied . " Were the Tarson brigands working for Paul ? " " We never were sure , " Herzer replied . " If I had to guess I 'd say yes . Paul and Chansa have got their fingers in a lot of the pies that are causing us trouble . " " But it 's settled now ? " Courtney asked . " As far as I can tell . " Herzer shrugged . " The people of Tarson are certainly on the side of light . Harzburg ... you can burn the place to the ground for all I give a damn . " " So are you staying the night ? " she pressed . " No , unfortunately , " the soldier said with a sigh . " My orders were to report ' without delay . ' So I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I figured I could take enough time to stop by and have some real food at least . " He grinned and carved off another slice of the pork . " You 're both looking good . The farm is looking good . I 'm glad . " He chewed on the pork with a thoughtful and sad expression for a moment , then smiled again . " Life could be a hell of a lot worse . " " Herzer , tell Duke Edmund that he 'd better let you get some rest or he 'll be talking to me , " Courtney said dangerously . " And you had better take it , Herzer Herrick . " " I will , " Herzer replied , looking around at the low room . Continues ...
