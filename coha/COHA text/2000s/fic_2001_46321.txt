RICHARD PURVIS WAS WALKING OVER the Pyrenees from Spain just as his father had more than fifty years before as a young lieutenant in the company of a band of Spanish guerrillas . He supposed his father had traveled mostly at night . He and the guerrilleros espanoles joined forces with the French maquis to mount an operation against the Germans . It was June . German troops could not be sent to Normandy if they were being pressed in southwest France . <p> It was cold in the mountains . Richard had put on a sweater under his parka as he stood on the highway and watched the little train of the Pyrenees , le petit train jaune , cross the road on the narrow-gauge tracks and then go clattering away along the mountainside , the immensity of which quickly turned the train into a toy . <p> A few days later he walked past a lake , the source of the river beside which his father had died . His father had been leading the rear guard of a band that had ambushed a German convoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their base in a nearby town , they had been ambushed themselves . But because of Richard 's father , who had held the road against the Germans with two other men , the maquis had escaped . <p> He ate his lunch of bread and cheese beside the river , here only a tiny rivulet , scarcely big enough for trout . Treeless pasture stretched away in all directions ; cowbells clanked in the distance . Across the high valley was a ski hotel built at the base of a network of runs cut across the face of the mountain . <p> Richard the Lion-Hearted . He had discovered that dedication in a Conrad novel a cousin had given his father on his birthday . It was a sentiment that seemed to Richard to have come straight out of Walter Scott . The same sort of thinking had caused his great-grandfather , a cavalry commander whose photograph was on the wall of his uncle 's house in Savannah , to initiate charges by speaking in a firm , clear voice to his men : " The gentlemen of the Effington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard that was the mystery , what he could not understand , how anyone could be so free with his life . Nothing his father had done beside the river that day had any effect on the outcome of the war . Yet he and the two other men , knowing they would likely die as a result , had held up the Germans . Richard had avoided service in Vietnam because he was the sole surviving son of a veteran killed in action . His cousins had all gone , and two of them had been killed . <p> Richard had written the office of tourism in a village close to where the action occurred and had received an account of it from a schoolteacher . The French had put up a commemorative marker . His mother , now dead , had kept a framed photograph of it in her bedroom . She had not remarried . There was no grave . The Germans had thrown the bodies into the river . Richard was to meet with the schoolteacher when he arrived . The teacher had written that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Today for the first time Richard 's body felt really good under the weight of the pack . He had lost some fat . He was becoming lean and hard . He lay on his back and watched a hawk turn in slow circles overhead . The hawk gave a shrill cry as its shadow passed over him , and then the bird disappeared behind a ridge . <p> He considered how he had failed at a series of businesses , including , in the end , his family 's hardware store , which a cousin had taken over and saved from bankruptcy . There were three failed marriages , the third gone with the store . Now he had made this trip on a small inheritance from an uncle . He had come to Spain to investigate importing cheap shotguns , a scheme that had the potential to make him a rich man . But instead of Madrid , where the manufacturer had its headquarters , he had flown into Barcelona . He told himself he should wait , not go to Madrid until he felt more optimism for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done after one of his businesses failed , wait patiently until some new idea filled him with enthusiasm . But the hardware store had been different . There was something about it that laid a heavy hand on his desire to succeed . <p> He lay there a long time , watching a line of clouds form over the mountains to the east and waiting for the hawk to return , but it never did . <p> Over the next few days , he followed the river down out of the mountains . Power plants had been built along its course , the water falling through giant tubes that came down the mountainsides from the high lakes . Fishermen were in the river after trout . <p> Then he walked down into a gorge where the river ran beside the highway . Now the fir trees were gone and the mountainsides , covered with scrub oaks , pines , and aromatic shrubs , had a dry Mediterranean look . The hum of cicadas was in the air . This was the road his father had defended . He looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the spot . Beyond it the river came out of the mountains and into the wide valley that held the ancient walled city of Carcassonne . After viewing the city he would take a train to Madrid and then fly home to Savannah . That night he went to sleep in a campground beside the river , listening to voices , French and Spanish and what he thought might be German . <p> His father had listened to those voices and known what they were saying . That was one reason he was sent to France . He had been at the state university when the war started , a French major intending to go to graduate school . He had hiked in the Pyrenees as a student . <p> At noon Richard walked into the schoolteacher 's village , which boasted of thermal baths , a brand-new casino on the road to Carcassonne , and a Roman church . He went to a cafe and ordered a beer , then called the schoolteacher , who gave him directions to a restaurant beside the river . <p> He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds of the combination restaurant and spa . He found Jean Camon , a young man in his twenties , seated at a green metal table under the shade of a huge tree . Richard had long ceased to wonder if his father had walked past a certain tree or looked at a certain vista , but for some reason the thought of his father sitting at the green table under the tree appealed to him . The place looked old enough . <p> " I was wondering if my father ate here , " Richard said . <p> " No , this place housed German officers , " Jean said . " They loved the waters . " <p> " Just like the Romans . " <p> Jean laughed . " Yes , they were famous for their love of baths . " <p> " And the Germans ? " <p> " They destroyed the Romans and would have destroyed us . What do you think you are going to find out there on the route to Carcassonne ? " <p> " I do n't know . " Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first marriage . <p> Jean then explained that his grandfather fought at Dien Bien Phu . On Bastille Day he stood on the village square wearing his medals . Jean wondered if his father would have returned to Vietnam if his grandfather had died there . <p> " I suppose the jungle has taken it back , " Richard said . <p> " Yes , growing fast in a few months , " Jean said . <p> A swan with five cygnets in her train walked past them across the grass and disappeared behind a boxwood hedge . <p> " He might not have wanted to go back there , " Richard said . " He might not have needed to . " <p> " And you have this need ? " Jean asked . <p> " I walked over the Pyrenees . " <p> " We will have lunch . Then I will take you to the place where your father was so brave . " <p> " The eyewitness ? " <p> " The old man lives in this village . He will be waiting for us . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her sister will care for her while we are gone . " <p> " Something serious ? " <p> " Yes , something that bathing forever in these waters can not cure . " <p> They had lunch . Fish soup , con fit de canard , and creme de Catalan . <p> They drank a bottle of the local heavy red wine . After they had coffee and Jean rolled a cigarette , Richard told this stranger about his three wives and the hardware store and his hopes to start an import business . <p> Then they were both silent . Jean was rolling another cigarette . Somewhere in the town an old man , probably one of the maquis , was waiting for someone to come care for his wife so he could explain to the American lieutenant 's son exactly what happened one day beside the river . Richard felt annoyed with Jean . What did this boy know about anything ? Just things he had learned out of books in school . <p> Jean looked at his watch . " Let me smoke this one , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the old man 's house . " <p> They sat , not talking , while Jean finished the cigarette . Richard listened to the rush of the river , which ran out of sight behind a stone wall , and the hum of the cicadas . He paid the bill , despite Jean 's protests . They walked along a stone path toward the iron gate . <p> " The old man is German , " Jean said . <p> " What ? " Richard asked . He was not sure he had heard correctly . <p> " Yes , a German , " Jean said . " He was a part of that action on the road . He was in love with a French girl from this village . After the war he came back for her . The old man has a bad hip . How do you say ? Ah , yes . Hip replacement . " <p> " He came back for love ? " <p> " Yes , love . We will go in my car to his house . " <p> Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wives , certainly not the way the German boy must have loved the French girl , abandoning his country for her . <p> The old man , dressed in the blue pants of a French workman , a sport coat , and heavy brogues , was standing at the door of his house . He was toothless and short , with a mane of white hair . His eyes were blue . He carried a small canvas sack by a strap slung over his shoulder . <p> After introductions the old man got into the backseat , and Jean drove them through the town and across a bridge over the river . Jean and the old man were engaged in conversation . <p> " We are talking about his wife , " Jean said . " He thinks that she will die soon . " <p> Jean turned right , onto a highway that followed the river . A set of train tracks ran on the other side of the river . Beyond the tracks the brush-covered mountainside rose almost straight up , and on the left side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white water now and then through the trees . The cicadas were loud in the brush ; a dry , dusty scent mixed with the smell of the aromatic shrubs . <p> They crossed back over the river and went under a railroad trestle . Then they drove past the stone foundations of what must have been the old railroad bridge . The old man turned in his seat and spoke to Richard , smiling as he did , his tongue protruding from his mouth as he formed the words without the help of teeth . <p> " He says your father 's band blew up the bridge , " Jean said . <p> The road twisted through the mountains , following the river 's course . Then Jean pulled the car to the shoulder . " The monument is around the bend , " he said . <p> They all got out . On the other side of the road was a sheer cliff . The roadway had been blasted out of the rock ; Richard could see marks where holes had been drilled for the charges . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trucks flashed past , appearing suddenly around either curve of the road . The silence following their passing was filled with the ferocious , insistent hum of the cicadas and the rush of the river , unseen behind a screen of shrubs . <p> " We must go slowly because of the old man 's hip , " Jean said . " Pay attention to the cars . " <p> A low stone wall was built a few inches from the road on the river side . For a time they were able to walk on the gravel margin between , but then the path disappeared as the wall came right up to the pavement , Jean helped the old man onto the top of the wall . With Jean in the lead and the old man next , they walked along it . As they came in view of the curve , Richard saw that there was a sort of alcove in the cliff . An iron fence was built across the opening , and inside , on a stretch of raked gravel , a slab of pink marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vase attached to the slab . Except for the flowers , the scene was identical to that photograph he had known from boyhood . <p> " We must help this old man , " Jean said . <p> They each took one of his arms and listened for the traffic . Car after car passed . A motorcycle came roaring down the road , taking the curve between two cars going in opposite directions . Then there was a lull , the only sounds the river and the cicadas . <p> " Vitel " Jean said . " Quick ! " <p> They hurried across the highway , the old man between them , their hands on his arms . Then they stood at the iron fence , safely behind a series of concrete posts set into the ground as a barrier against the traffic . The sunlight was hitting the marble at such an angle that the reflection made it impossible for Richard to read the writing . Next to the cliff a seep came out and formed a tiny pool . The vegetation around it was luxuriant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all walked onto the gravel and stood before the monument . Richard read his father 's name , 1st Lt. Richard Purvis , cut into the marble . There were a French name and a Spanish name beneath it . For a few moments they all looked at the names . <p> Then the old man began to speak , pointing toward where the road curved out of sight in the direction of Carcassonne . He spoke for some time until Jean held up his hand . <p> Jean explained how the old man 's platoon surprised Richard 's father 's band three kilometers from the marker . But it was an imperfect ambush , because the man assigned to hit the lead truck with a Panzerfaust , an anti-tank rocket , missed , and though there were losses , Richard 's father 's band was able to disengage and carry off a good part of the war materiel . <p> His father took up a position at the marker , a Thompson machine gun in his hands . The two other men covered the approach from the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks . It was easy for two men to do that in a narrow place if they had courage . <p> The mountain kept the Germans from flanking them on one side , and the river made it difficult to do on the other . Even if they crossed the river and gained the railroad tracks , there was no field of fire from there onto the maquis ' position . And the bridge was out , so they could not cross behind them . There was no approach to the village from that side , so it was impossible to gain possession of the highway bridge . <p> Then the old man pointed across the river and began to talk again . Richard looked at the shrub-covered mountainside and wondered what he was saying . He was excited , moving his arms and hands about as he spoke . <p> Jean explained that the old man 's sergeant sent him across the river to climb until he had a clear field of fire on the maquis ' position . He was the best shot in his platoon , and killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun would be easy . <p> The old man was silent . He stood there looking up at the mountainside . Then he looked directly at Richard , his blue eyes lively , his tongue working to form the words . <p> " He says that those three devoted themselves to acts of foolish bravery that day , " Jean said . <p> Richard considered his father 's predicament . He was a young man and those others likely young men too , their whole lives before them , who knew they were probably going to die in order for a few other men to escape with trucks loaded with war materiel . Better to drive the trucks into the river and then scatter into the high mountains , where the Germans would never find them . <p> The old man was talking again , pointing at the mountainside across the river , talking slowly and seriously . <p> Richard learned from Jean that the river was high and the old man almost drowned crossing it , in the process losing his rifle . But he still had a pistol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man with the machine gun clearly and shoot up all his ammunition at a range he guessed would be at least three hundred meters . <p> The old man paused and took a book out of the canvas sack . As he leafed through it , Richard saw that most of it was filled with handwriting . Here and there were sketches of soldiers . He stopped at a drawing of a beautiful girl who sat on a rock beside a river . <p> " Ma femme , " he said . <p> " It is his wife , " Jean said . <p> The old man continued to leaf through , passing by photographs and documents he had pasted into the book . Then he turned a page and there was a drawing of a soldier wearing a beret crouched behind a rock , a Thompson gun in his hands . <p> The old man began to talk again , jabbing his finger at the picture as he spoke . <p> " He says that he fired his pistol at your father , " Jean said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the action through , how do you say ? " Jean formed his fingers in circles and placed them over his eyes . <p> " Binoculars ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> The old man pointed again at the picture of Richard 's father . He started to talk again and pointed toward the thick wall of shrubs on the other side of the road . <p> Jean explained how the old man 's sergeant sent men against the maquis by the river and killed them both . Richard 's father still held the road , but the men coming up from the river were approaching his flank . He knew his friends were dead because they had stopped firing . He would have known that because they were armed with Russian rifles . The sound was easy to distinguish . <p> Richard walked to the edge of the road and put his hand on the piece of the cliff behind which his father crouched . Jean continued to translate . <p> His father had good discipline with the machine gun . He made his ammunition last as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was intending to take a position at the foundations of the destroyed railroad bridge . That was when one of the men came up onto , the road from the river and killed him . <p> The old man took up the book again and turned pages until he reached a drawing of Richard 's father lying facedown on the road , one hand still on the Thompson . He continued to turn the pages and re  --  vealed a drawing of a stretch of rapids with a group of soldiers standing with their rifles slung and looking out over the water . To Richard it did not seem quite real , and he turned and looked at the rock wall and the road , those places that had held the presence of his father . Then the old man spoke briefly and put his hand on Richard 's shoulder . <p> Jean told him how the sergeant ordered the bodies thrown into the river . He was not a cruel man , but he had lost three brothers on the Russian front . The old man regretted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he only had the monument . <p> " Ask him if he would have acted as my father did , " Richard said . Jean spoke to . the old man , who thought for a moment and then grinned and spoke . <p> " He says that your father was young and he was young , " Jean said . " He says that all young soldiers are filled with foolish bravery . " <p> Richard walked over to the monument , the gravel crunching under his boots . He stood before it and listened to the hum of the cicadas and the drip of the seep . Foolish bravery , he thought . <p> The old man and Jean walked up to stand beside him . The old man spoke again . <p> Jean explained that for the old man it was a strange action because he had been an observer instead of a participant . That had not happened many times . He watched men die on both sides . He watched them throw the bodies into the river . It gave him a strange feeling . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be God or a general . <p> " Ask him how my father did it , " Richard said . <p> " He will only tell you that it was foolish bravery , " Jean said . " What is it that you wish to know ? " <p> " How my father stood right here when he knew he was going to die . I could n't have done that . " <p> " I do not know . You know the old man 's answer . " <p> The old man spoke again , and Jean translated : If he had not lost his rifle , he would have easily killed Richard 's father . Then they would have overtaken the trucks carrying the war materiel . <p> They all went across the road again , Jean and Richard on either side of the old man , and walked along the top of the stone wall and then beside it to the car . Jean drove them back to town . No one spoke until Jean stopped in front of the old man 's house . Richard felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him speak . " He wants to give you his drawing of your father , " Jean said . " The one that shows him fighting from the rock . " <p> " No , " Richard said . <p> " Yes , " the old man said . <p> " You will have to take it , " Jean said . <p> Richard liked the idea of seeing the drawing just once , only for a few seconds . He had done nothing to deserve to possess it . <p> " Tell him I ca n't take it , " Richard said . <p> Jean spoke to the old man . <p> " Yes , " the old man said . " Yes . " <p> " If you do not take it you will offend him , " Jean said . <p> " Tell him thank you , " Richard said . <p> Jean spoke to the old man , who reached out and put his hand lightly on Richard 's shoulder again . <p> Richard turned and looked at the old man , who was sitting with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carefully he cut out the page , the knife making a rasping sound as it worked through the heavy paper . Then he gave the sheet to Richard , who sat for a moment with it in his hand , looking at his father crouched by the rock , the Thompson on his shoulder . <p> Jean and the old man got out of the car . Richard got out . He shook hands with the old man and thanked him through Jean for the drawing . Then the old man smiled at them and disappeared into his house . <p> As they drove away , Jean explained he was leaving that afternoon for a weekend backpacking trip in the Pyrenees . He dropped Richard off at the campground next to the river . <p> " He has never talked to me about that action , " Jean said . " I think it was disturbing to him . " <p> Richard did not know what to say in reply , so he said nothing . He thanked Jean for his help and watched him drive off . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how often the old man was accustomed to take out his journal and leaf through it . He wondered what the old man thought as he remembered the past , a person more comfortable as a participant than as a spectator of war . <p> That night he slept well beside the river , drifting off to the sound of water rushing over the rocks . And he knew that Jean was sleeping somewhere in the high mountains and that the old man was asleep in his house with his dying wife . <p> In the morning he loaded his backpack and walked into the village and had breakfast in a cafe . He considered taking the train to Carcassonne and then on to Madrid . But the thought of beginning negotiations with the gun manufacturer did not excite him . <p> It was already hot as he walked along the highway beside the river . The cicadas were wild in the shrubs . He passed the monument to his father and the other fighters , but he did not cross the road to it . He walked on around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long ago had been filled with German soldiers . His body felt good , the weight of the pack resting easily on his hips and shoulders . He tried to put everything but the physical act of walking out of his mind . <p> After a few kilometers the road straightened and the river widened . As far as he could see , plane trees lined the road , and he walked out of the blinding sunlight into that cool corridor . The river was marked by a line of trees , and there were fields of sunflowers , some taller than a man , on either side of the road . He passed a sign to Carcassonne . The image of the walled city , its turrets and towers rising out of that yellow and brown and green landscape , filled his mind . But beneath that pleasant vision was still the mystery of his father and himself , something that could not be explained by the drawing buried deep in his pack . <p> Foolish bravery , he thought . Foolish bravery . <p> With these words in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling the weight of the pack for the first time , knowing that the trek was going to be much harder when he emerged into the sunlight . But right now the weight was not so bad , and he gave himself up to the act of walking , just as he imagined his father had so many times as he climbed to a place of refuge in the mountains . <p> Then he realized how unpleasant it was going to be to get on the train to Madrid . He could go to other places . Paris . Rome . He had enough money to live comfortably in either city for several months . But he knew he would go to Madrid . It would be hot there ; he would have to wear a suit . He could see nothing to his life but an endless string of such ventures , all of them ultimately failures . <p> The pack was beginning to feel not only heavy but uncomfortable . It pulled on his lower back . He stepped off the road and dropped the pack and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down beside it and took a drink of water . <p> In Madrid he would negotiate hard so there would be money left over for a prostitute . Not a simple girl but someone who spoke good English , a girl he could take out to the best restaurant in the city . After sex they would sit on the balcony of his hotel , for he would take a room with a balcony , and look out on the lights of the city . Then he would tell her he was going to put those Spanish shotguns in every discount store in the United States . And she would believe him . She would believe every word . <p> Author Affiliation
