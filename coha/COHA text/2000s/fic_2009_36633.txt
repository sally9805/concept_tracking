Corpses should be better behaved . <p> Mr. Lyle Kourtis , aged ninety-three years , has been resting on my embalming table for less than an hour , but he 's already belched four times . I would n't mind so much-the dead do burp and even shift occasionally-but the hour is late , darkness is pressing at the windows , and I 'm alone in the chilly prep room . <p> Gerald had run to the drugstore for cotton balls , so I 've been left to bathe Mr. Kourtis . The job wo n't be difficult-the old man is as thin as a bird , and rigor is not so pronounced that he 's resisting my efforts . The arterial embalming is well under way , the Porti-Boy rhythmically clicking as it sends embalming fluid through a plastic tube and into our client 's carotid artery . A bath will help the solution move through the arteries in the gentleman 's limbs . <p> I pick up the hose , turn on the water , and test the temperature by spraying a stream over my wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula when Clay and Bugs were babies . The water does n't have to be warm , of course-Mr . Kourtis certainly wo n't care if it 's cool-but Gerald has ingrained in me such a respect for the dead that I can no more imagine giving my client a cold shower than I could perform an embalming without a hand towel draped over the body 's most private organs . <p> My professors in the mortuary program thought my methods quaint , but they are Gerald 's methods , born out of love for others . <p> As the Porti-Boy clicks and hums , I spray the few strands of white hair on Mr. K. 's head and smooth the deeply scored lines from his fore head . This man came to us from the Pleasant Valley Nursing Home , where he had been a resident for nine years . According to the file we found waiting on the zippered body bag , he outlived two of his sons . A daughter , Felicia , lives in Winter Haven , while a granddaughter lives here in Mt . Dora . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before beginning our work . Mr. Kourtis was wise enough to preplan his funeral , so Gerald and I have proceeded according to his wishes . The administrator at Pleasant Valley informed Felicia Kourtis Josten of her father 's death , so I followed up with a call and left a message asking if she had any preference as to the time of the funeral service . <p> I suspect that it may be attended by few family members . The daughter may be in her seventies , and though Winter Haven is only an hour 's drive away , miles of teeming tourist traffic lie between our funeral home and Felicia Josten . I do n't know many older folks who like driving at breakneck highway speeds ... which is probably how they survived to be older folks . <p> I squirt a dime-size glob of shampoo into my wet palm and work it into Mr. Kourtis 's thin hair . " I hope your daughter can make it , " I tell him . " But if she does n't , do n't you worry about having a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The back door opens , followed by Gerald 's laugh and a rush of cool April air . " Congratulations , " he says , stamping mud from his shoes . " Though you wo n't find it written in any book , one of the surest ways to know you 're ready to be a full-time funeral director is when you start talking to the clients . " <p> I grin as I pick up the spray nozzle . " They do n't seem to mind a little conversation . " <p> " They do n't . But do let me know if they start talking back . " Gerald tosses a bag of cotton balls onto the counter and lumbers to the sink where body fluids and clotted blood are draining from the trough in the side of the prep table . " Everything okay ? " <p> " Everything 's fine , " I say , rinsing Mr. K. 's hair and sending a stream of soapy water into the trough as well . " No plumbing problems tonight . " <p> " Good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want me to shave him ? " <p> " Already finished . His cheeks are clean and prickle-free . " <p> " I wish everything about this case were prickle-free . " <p> I glance up . " Is there a problem I do n't know about ? " <p> " Maybe not ... but at the time Mr. Kourtis signed his preneed papers , his daughter and his second wife had a falling-out . They flew out of here like a pair of hornets , buzzing at each other the entire way . " <p> " There 's no mention of a wife in the file . The daughter is listed as next of kin . " <p> " That 's because the woman divorced Lyle right after she put him in the home . If the ex-wife and the daughter meet at the funeral , we might see a few fireworks . " <p> I smile as I spray Mr. K. 's shoulders with an antibacterial solution . " That contract was signed a long time ago . Surely you do n't think those women are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory about such things . " <p> " So do some men . " <p> " Point taken . But I 'm wondering if we should n't do something to keep those gals apart in the chapel . " <p> I rub soap into Mr. Kourtis 's skin , massaging his upper arm and working the pink arterial fluid through his capillaries . " I do n't think you need to worry . If both women show up , surely they 'll come together in their grief . They 'll have to realize that they both loved this man . " <p> Gerald gives me a narrowed glance . " Funerals do n't always bring out the best in people , missy . " <p> " Just leave it to me . " I reach for the spray nozzle again . " If they both show up , I 'll have a talk with them before the service . If they still have hard feelings toward one another , I 'll do what I can to bring them together ... or seat them on opposite sides of the chapel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table and surveys the room . " Okay , what else do you need ? " <p> I glance at him , noticing that his voice sounds more gravelly than usual . Dark circles lie under his eyes , and his color seems ... off . " You look exhausted . " I shut off the water . " Why do n't you go on up to bed ? " <p> Gerald gestures to the man on the table . " I ought a help you . " <p> " It 's okay ; I do n't think I 'm going to have any problems . In a couple of hours I 'll be done and headed upstairs to tuck the boys into bed . " <p> He looks around as if searching for something to do , but I sidestep and catch his eye . " Thanks for the cotton balls . You go on up , and I 'll call you if I run into a problem . We 'll get Mr. K. casketed tomorrow . " <p> Gerald sighs and turns toward the door that leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake my head when the door finally clicks behind him . I do n't know why he 's so worried about Mr. Kourtis 's survivors . In all Gerald 's years at Fairlawn , I know he 's noticed how funerals often bring people together . The power of a meaningful , reverent memorial service is one of the reasons I 'm proud to say I 'm an apprentice funeral director . <p> Morticians fix things . We repair broken bodies and restore ruptured relationships . When death comes , we minister to the deceased and help the living continue with their lives . We act as the hands of Jesus in caring for the dead and ministering to the grief-stricken family . <p> Gerald stepped into my life and helped me put its frayed elements back together . If not for him , I do n't know where my boys and I would be . <p> I startle when another soft burp escapes Mr. K. 's lips . " Do n't you worry , " I tell my client , reaching for a towel . " I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll be proud of them . " <p> I smile as I wipe glistening water droplets from the old man 's face . After two years of living in Mt . Dora , I think I understand why God brought my boys and me to the Fairlawn Funeral Home . <p> Chapter Two Leticia Gansky lowers the phone and reaches for her husband . " Pop-pop 's passed on , " she says , squeezing Charley 's shoulder . She blinks at the sting of sudden tears . " He died this afternoon . " <p> Charley turns his attention from the blaring TV tucked beneath the kitchen cabinet . " Huh ? " <p> " My grandfather died . " She returns to her chair at the kitchen table . " Mom said he died after lunch . Right after a big plate of beef Stroganoff . " <p> Her husband stops chewing . " The old geezer was done in by a plate of pasta ? " <p> Leticia struggles to swallow her irritation . Men can be so dense . " Do n't think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a nap , and did n't wake up . " <p> Charley snorts . " When you 're old , that 's a good way to go . What was he , two hundred and six ? " <p> " Ninety-three . " Leticia drops her chin into her palm . " Ninety-three and he still had all his marbles . Mom said the last time she went to see him he was complaining about politics . Said the commercials cut into his soap operas . " <p> Her husband looks back to the television , where overpaid athletes are playing a baseball game in some faraway city . <p> Leticia picks up her fork . " Imagine being ninety-three and still following your favorite soap operas . " <p> Charley stabs a Tater Tot and pops it into his mouth , then grins at the TV , where a runner is sliding across home plate . <p> After taking a bite of chicken , Leticia chews slowly and wonders if she should feel sad . She loved the old man , but for the last few years the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though Pleasant Valley Nursing Home is only ten minutes away , she has n't visited Pop-pop in months . Charley keeps her busy answering the phones for his air-conditioning business , and she has her daughters and grandchildren to think of . Between their needs and Charley 's , Leticia does n't have time to go trotting down to the old folks ' home every time she feels a twinge of guilt . <p> But she will make time for the funeral . Pop-pop was smart enough to take care of everything beforehand , so she 'll send a nice spray of flowers , make sure to sign the girls ' names to the card , and show up early for a front-row seat . <p> Maybe she 'll be asked to say something during the service . After she clears the dishes , she ought to sit down with a pen and paper to see if she can come up with something sweet and amusing to say . Pop-pop was such a great guy-in his day , he was so popular , folks always said he should run for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his friends . <p> " You know- " Leticia swallows a bite of chicken- " it 's too bad we do n't hold funerals while people are around to enjoy them . Might be nice to tell about the good things folks have done while they 're still able to appreciate the comments . " <p> Charley grins as another baseball player scores ; then he winks at her . " Whatever you say , hon. " He picks up his iced tea glass and tips it until it chinks against hers . " I could n't have said it better myself . " <p> The man has just toasted a comment about death . Was he even listening ? <p> She lifts her own iced tea glass and swirls it until the sweetener in the bottom disappears . Charley might miss having a hot meal waiting when he finally comes in from work , and he might miss clean laundry after a week or two . But if she died , would he miss her ? <p> Would anyone ? <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
