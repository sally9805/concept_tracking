Headnote After a year of scandal and mayhem , it 's time for the yellow jersey to create a new champion . Here 's what to watch for . the main event THE RACE MAKES THE RIDERS , NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND . WHO 'S UP FOR CORONATION ? ALEXANDER VINOKOUROV ASTANA Barred from starting last year 's Tour when his team was swept up in the Operacin Puerto scandal , Vino ( who was booted not because he was personally implicated , but because so many on his team were implicated that the team no longer met the minimum number of riders requirement ) took out his frustrations in the Tour of Spain , stomping the competition . But even 10 Vuelta titles wo n't make up for a missed chance at the Tour . He 'll be 34 in September , and with the added bitterness of being sidelined despite doing nothing wrong , he wants victory-now . An experienced rider on arguably the strongest team in the race , Vino knows exactly what he has to do , and has every bit of confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins it all . LEVI LEIPHEIMER DISCOVERY If Leipheimer felt jilted when Discovery signed Ivan Basso last fall , taking the shine off his return as team leader for the only American squad in the race , then this is his chance to prove that he was the better choice all along . Basso is fin/to after admitting his involvement in Puerto , which leaves Leipheimer , 33 , at the helm of the only team in the race with thefirepowerto meet Astana head-on . But Leipheimer is as cautious as Vino is bold . Does he have the killer instinct necessary to succeed ? OUTLOOK : Leipheimer is the only truly top-tier American in the race , with victories in stage races such as last year 's Dauphin Libr and this spring 's Tour of California . But he has n't shown yet that he can control a Grand Tour . OSCAR PEREIRO CAISSE D'EPARGNE Pereiro , 29 , was fortunate to finish second ( pending the outcome of Floyd ? Landis 's case ) in the 2006 Tour . He 'll likely get lucky again and inherit his team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the everwidening Puerto probe . Pereiro would jump at the chance to prove 2006 was no fluke , but Caisse d'Epargne ca n't go toe-to-toe with Astana and Disco , and may elect to spread its bets rather than put everything behind an overall bid by Pereiro , who was wildly inconsistent in last year 's race . OUTLOOK : Pereiro is no stranger to the pressures of the Tour , but he 's simply outclassed by riders like Vino . Top five would be a great finish for him . ANDREAS KLDEN ASTANA Klden finished second in 2004 when he beat his team leader , Jan Ullrich , and third last year , when he was supposed to ride support for Ullrich ( suspendedPuerto ) , so he 's proven he has the motor to win it all . Klodi notched an earlyseason win at Tirreno-Adriatico , but he 's also a head case , more comfortable , a in the lieutenant role than under the pressure of being team leader . This year he will again start the race in the shadow of a leader , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falters , Klden , 32 , could assume the reigns . Could it be the German 's year ? OUTLOOK : Klden could be the key to an Astana victory , but it likely wo n't be his own . CARLOS SASTRE CSC Sastre , 32 , stepped up admirably last year for CSC when race-favorite Basso J was yanked under Puerto suspicion , finishing fourth . But then Sastre had the support of a team made to win the Tour . For 2007 , without a clear lead rider , the Danish team will come out swinging at any chance for a stage win , initiating or jumping into breaks and always pressing the pace . CSC 's tactics will make the race worth watching , but without eight guys to support a leader 's ambitions , Sastre likely will play the attacking role as well , making his overall chances a long-odds gamble . OUTLOOK : Top 10 ? Bet on it . Top 5 ? Probably . Yellow in Paris ? Eh , not very likely . you got ta see this THESE RACERS WILL SPECTACULARLY ATTACK , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUVAL-PRODIR PAST TENSE : After two years away on a doping ban , Britain 's Millar proved he 's back at the sport 's top level with time-trial wins at last year 's Tour of Spain and this spring 's Paris-Nice . FUTURE PERFECT ? Millar would love to make a splash by winning the Prologue on his home turf in London , giving him another opportunity to stump his " you can win clean " message . But he animates the race as much with his personality as with his prowess on the bike . Boy Dave speaks his mind , likes to party and is the antithesis of the robotic racer who counts calories : Right after the Brasstown Bald stage of the Tour de Georgia , Millar was seen carbo loading with a can of Bud . Win or lose , Millar is worth watching . FRANK SCHLECK CSC PAST TENSE : Franky smoked ' ' 04 Giro d'ltalia winner Damiano Cunego to win the Alpe d'Huez stage last year , achieving the great distinction of being the first Luxembourger to win on the fabled mountain . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FUTURE PERFECT ? This year , at only 27 vears old , the gifted climber will be turned loose again to try for stage wins . Look for him as a future contender to win it all . THOR HUSHOVD CREDIT AGRICOLE PAST TENSE : Expect the sprinters ' greenjersey competition to be a Tom BoonenAlessandro Petacchi affair ? Do n't count out the mighty Norwegian sprinter , who won in 2005 . Hushovd can match speed with anyone in the pack other than Rabobank 's Oscar Freire ( who on his best day is unbeatable ) but he has a consistency that , among sprinters , only Predictor-Lotto 's Robbie McEwen , last year 's green-jersey winner , can match . FUTURE PERFECT ? Petacchi is as reliable as Paris Hilton 's driving record , and Boonen carries the weight of all of Belgium on his shoulders . Hushovd may not win six stages , but he 's a good bet to be decked in green on the Champs-Elyses . STEFAN SCHUMACHER GEROLSTEINER PAST TENSE : No relation to Formula One driver Michael , cycling 's " Schumi " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the scene and into the pink leader 's jersey for a couple of days of the 2006 Tour of Italy , Schumacher powered his way to victory in this year 's Amstel Gold race . FUTURE PERFECT ? The versatile 25-year-old German promises to be a force in the opening week of racing . ALESSANDRO BALLAN LAMPRE-FONDITAL PAST TENSE : After winning the Tour of Flanders , the Italian proved that he 's one of the world 's top oneday riders . FUTURE PERFECT ? He could attack in the flat and rolling stages ; Lampre 's leader , Cunego , is inconsistent , so Lampre will set Ballan free for stage wins . Stage 2 , on the same roads as Flanders , is a perfect fit . Where are the Americans ? Discovery is increasingly an international team , but the able George Hincapie , 34 , will start his 12th Tour , this time supporting compatriot Leipheimer 's bid for the overall . Tom Danielson , 29 , after four seasons of racing in Europe , may finally get his first taste of the race . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to steal a stage win . U.S. time-trial champ Dave Zabriskie will be looking to blast the Prologue and spend some time in yellow , as he did in 2005 , while support rider Christian Vandevelde could be a dark horse for a stage win . Leadout sprinter Fred Rodriguez of Predictor-Lotto might be supporting Australian Robbie McEwen , while his teammate Chris Horner has built his entire season around the Tour . A few rising stars you wo n't see in France this summer : Saul Raisin ( Credit Agricole ) continues to recover from head injuries after a horrible crash in spring of 2006 , and Cofidis 's young classics rider Tyler Farrar is rehabbing from a busted kneecap suffered in the Tour of Flanders . Aaron Olseil is recuperating from T-Mobile 's Giro d'Italia campaign .

THE CIRCUS PROLOGUE , JULY 7 LONDON , ENGLAND , 8KM With a route that winds around London landmarks such as Big Ben , the Prologue will be like a Travel Channel special on bikes , and an example of what makes the Tour unique : No other sporting event in the world blends culture , history and scenic beauty with jaw-dropping talent as seamlessly . HOUSE MONEY : Britain 's David Millar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he 's not the only Brit who will be all guns . Watch out for Cofidis 's Bradley Wiggins , perhaps the finest track pursuit rider in the world . MAYHEM STAGE 2 , JULY 9 DUNKERQUE , FRANCE , TO GAND , BELGIUM , 168.5KM The route is short , mostly flat and-crashes aside-wo n't change the fortunes of the general classification , or GC , contenders . But after it dips into Belgium , this stage runs over some of the same roads as the Tour of Flanders . They 're tight , sometimes rough and peppered with short but steep little bergs that could spring a break . A big field of riders with stage-win hopes will make this nervous stage worth watching , just for the unexpected . HOUSE MONEY : Alessandro Ballan won Flanders and would love to bookend that with a Tour win , but our guess is Tornado Tom Boonen will control this day . * 1HAKEOUT STAGE 8 , JULY 15 LE GRAND BORNAND TO TIGNES , 165KM The second Alpine stage , and the first real chance to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive climbs in the last 75 kilometers . Individually , none is a breakpoint for the race , but by the final ascent to Tignes , we should know who the true overall contenders are , and whose hopes are shattered . HOUSE MONEY : Is this where Vinokourov lays it down ? Probably not . Unless he does . Otherwise , look for the favorites to test each other while a pure climber goes for victory . CSC 's Frank Schleck or a French rider like Sandy Casar of Franaise des Jeux are good bets . RACE OF RUTH STAGE 13 , JULY 21 54KM The first individual time trial in this year 's Tour is later in the race than usual , and it will offer an opportunity for both the pure TT specialists and the GC contenders to make a move . The technical and somewhat hilly course will produce both a worthy winner and point to an overall victor in Paris-but on this day they may not be the same person . HOUSE MONEY : T-Mobile does n't have a serious GC contender , but three-time world-time-trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSC will unleash Bobby Julich , and Astana 's Klden is one to watch , too . * THE KINGMAKER STAG E 14 , JULY 22 MAZAMET TO PLATEAU DE BEILLE , 197KM With no rest day after the time trial , riders will have heavy legs going into this tough Pyreneean stage , where Lance Armstrong won in ' ' 02 and ' ' 04 . The steeper roads favor a pure climber , who may have held back in yesterday 's TT in anticipation of this moment . HOUSE MONEY : The contenders will watch each other , leaving the stage to an enterprising attacker , possibly in an early break . The Spaniards , like Discovery 's Alberto Contador , could go , as could a fearless attacker like Rabobank 's Michael Rasmussen . Look for a second race among the GC contenders , where the next champion will emerge . * A ROYAL BEATDOWN STAGE 16 , JULY 25 ORTHEZ TO COL D'AUBISQUE , 218.5KM After a rest day in Pau , this stage is the last chance for riders to make a big move . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9.3km ramp of 7.7 percent average gradient , which comes about 40km from the finish at the Courette ski station on the Col d'Aubisque . This stage dips into Spain , so watch for the Spaniards and particularly Basque riders to animate . HOUSE MONEY : Unless he has the race well in hand , this is where Vino goes all Godzilla-in-Tokyo . Astana will blow up the field on the penultimate climb to whittle it down , then Vino will finish things off .
