To prepare for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals -- and an expected sweep of the Bulls -- he first selected a high-energy Nas tune , but after nodding to the beat for several measures , he abruptly switched to a mellower cut . Then , following the Pistons ' 102 -- 87 loss , Sheed cranked up Chaka Khan singing Tell Me Something Good to ear-splitting decibel levels , only to emerge from the shower and switch to the Lipps Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Like the mercurial Wallace , the Pistons had a hard time striking the right note on Sunday . After sweeping the Orlando Magic , the Pistons had handled Chicago with such insouciance ( they won the first two games by a combined 47 points and methodically stormed back from a 19-point deficit to win the third ) that it was impossible not to recall the playoff battles of two decades ago , when Chuck Daly 's Detroit Bad Boys routinely beat up Michael Jordan and stole Scottie Pippen 's lunch money . But then Detroit botched a close-out game against a Bulls team ripe for the picking , getting outrebounded 51 -- 33 and outscored 27 -- 13 in a tide-turning third quarter . " We were lackadaisical and just played too relaxed both offensively and defensively , " said backup forward Antonio McDyess . The words lackadaisical and relaxed were seldom applied to the Bad Boys . // Perhaps , then , the most salient question is n't how these Pistons stack up against the 1989 and ' 90 title teams -- the estimable link between the two , president of basketball operations Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the championship magic of Detroit ' 04 , considering that the rosters are largely the same ( minus one neurotic genius on the bench named Larry Brown ) . This presupposes , of course , that the Pistons first eliminate the Bulls , then get by the winner of the Cleveland Cavaliers --  New Jersey Nets series , which the Cavs led 3 -- 1 after an 87 -- 85 win on Monday night . It 's hard to imagine they wo n't . Having started the postseason 7 -- 0 ( chart , page 46 ) , Detroit is clearly superior to anyone in the East . Funkier , too . // There are ways in which the current model out of Detroit is inferior to the one of three years ago . While the Pistons of ' 04 took their preternatural cool from point guard Chauncey Billups , who is still preternaturally cool , they got their defensive ferocity from center Ben Wallace . It was Wallace 's ability to blanket the court -- he would venture out to scuttle high pick-and-rolls and still be able to recover to defend underneath -- that eventually turned the Finals against the Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five , taking the last three games by a total of 41 points . ) Wallace is a Bull now , and in his place is 34-year-old Chris Webber , who did n't play much defense even before the 2003 microfracture surgery on his left knee that severely limited his mobility . Judging from his poor performance in the Chicago series ( he missed all eight of his shots in Games 3 and 4 and sat both fourth quarters ) , C-Webb may well be a nullity throughout the rest of the postseason , with most of his minutes absorbed by McDyess. // Lack of depth is another concern , especially if McDyess becomes a de facto starter . The ' 04 Pistons brought Corliss Williamson , Mehmet Okur , Mike James , Elden Campbell and Lindsey Hunter off the bench , trumping the current trio of Flip Murray and Carlos Delfino , both offensive-minded wings , and Jason Maxiell , a second-year power forward . In the first four games of the Chicago series , the five Detroit starters plus McDyess played 796 out of a possible 960 minutes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 36 he is more Lindsey than hunter . // There 's also the **30;62;TOOLONG difference . Though Brown 's legacy has been tarnished by his nightmarish 2005 -- 06 season with the New York Knicks , at the time of the ' 04 championship he was the master of his domain , a Prospero able to squeeze miracles from a team considered good but not great even when the playoffs began . Saunders , by contrast , is burdened by years of playoff failure in Minnesota ( his Timberwolves made it out of the first round only once in nine-plus seasons ) and the memory of last year when , in his first season , his 64-win Pistons lost in the Eastern finals to the Miami Heat . // And finally , Detroit 's Western Conference opponent wo n't be a team with squabbling superstars ( see : Shaq versus Kobe in L.A. , the final days ) . The Pistons ' likely foil will be whichever battle-tested and adaptable group emerges from the semifinal between the Phoenix Suns and the San Antonio Spurs . In either case Detroit ca n't bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side : why Detroit ' 07 should like its title chances . Well , just to get this out of the way , the Pistons let Ben Wallace ride into the sunset ( he signed a four-year , $60 million free-agent deal last summer ) at precisely the right time . While Big Ben is still missed on defense from time to time ( see below ) , he has lost a step and his offensive game is as putrid as ever . Before redeeming himself in Game 4 with an 11-point , 17-rebound effort , Wallace played poorly and even drew a team fine for arriving only 76 minutes before Game 3 . ( Coach Scott Skiles mandates that his players are in the locker room 90 minutes before tip-off . ) That prompted Steve Rosenbloom of the Chicago Tribune to blog , " A guy whose nickname comes from a clock was late to Game 3. " // Plus , Big Ben , who was sometimes the plainspoken diplomat on a Detroit team sorely in need of one , had just as often turned into a pain in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reenter a game in Orlando in the final month and griped that not enough plays were being run for him . // As for who is there , Billups and Rip Hamilton are an even better guard tandem than they were in ' 04 , and they were good then . Not even the Suns ' two-time MVP , Steve Nash , looks as downright comfortable with the ball as Billups , and no one since Reggie Miller works harder than Hamilton at getting open . Dumars makes a great point about the backcourt that , since he assembled it in 2002 with a free-agent signing ( Billups ) and a trade ( Hamilton ) , has only gotten better with age : " They do n't get in each other 's way . " // Tayshaun Prince is significantly improved from ' 04 , his first year as a starter . The rationale Dumars always uses when asked why he chose Darko Milicic instead of high-scoring Carmelo Anthony in the 2003 draft is that he already had a Prince of a small forward . Given the surrounding cast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent player through the first four games of the Chicago series ( he averaged 19.8 points , 8.3 rebounds ) , is a better fit for this team than Anthony would have been ? // As for Rasheed Wallace , the Music Man , he is the fulcrum upon which the Pistons often turn . Though he too often defers to his teammates on offense , he is capable of taking over games . And he is the only 6 ' 11 ' ' player in the league who can post up , then go out and calmly drain three-pointers. // Defensively the Pistons without Big Ben are not as good a man-to-man team ; they surrendered 1.6 points per game more this season than last . But they more than compensate with what Saunders calls his HPTFZ defense -- the Hyperbolic , Paraboloid , Transitional Floating Zone . Saunders wanted to use it last year , but Ben Wallace resisted because he preferred to play man . It 's a basic 3 -- 2 matchup , but considering that the 6 ' 9 " Prince and his freakish 7 ' 2 " wingspan occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is nothing basic about it . " Tayshaun is my Garnett , " says Saunders , who first used the defense with the Timberwolves , installing 6 ' 11 " Kevin Garnett up top . " Agile , long arms , smart and wants to play it . " The zone is so intimidating -- in Game 3 the Bulls got about three good looks at the basket in the second half , scoring just 30 points -- that sometimes after made baskets the Pistons fake it . They wait downcourt for the offense to arrive , hands held high , bouncing on their toes , as if they 're about to employ the HPTFZ . The offense frantically shifts gears to go against a zone , perhaps eschewing a high pick-and-roll , only to discover that Detroit is actually in a man-to-man. // The fact that Saunders was able to institute his HPTFZ speaks to the firmer hold he has on the team . The zone is Saunders 's baby , and he was hesitant to use it last season because he was still feeling his way . The Pistons as presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teammates can talk all night about what a wonderful player Rasheed Wallace is , but he still loses concentration during games , as he did in Game 4 , and frequently hurts the team with his outbursts -- and the players will never do backflips over Flip . But he has their attention . " After Larry Brown left , these guys wanted to show that they did n't even need a coach , " says a member of the Pistons ' hierarchy . " I do n't think it was until March of this year that they really got on the same page with Flip . Now they 're all together . " // The best thing the Pistons have going for them , though , is the same hard-edged attitude they showed in ' 04 , a legacy from the Bad Boys . They seem fueled by a collective distemper . Virtually every whistle that goes against them is met with exasperation and disbelief . Rasheed Wallace has been the league 's technical-foul champ for three years running ( he had 21 this season ) , and Hamilton , whose plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amar ? Stoudemire for second this year with 15 . Prince appears as if he bears the weight of the world on his narrow shoulders . Billups is all business . And if you look closely , the smile that Webber flashes from time to time is actually a smirk ; although he arrived from the Philadelphia 76ers only in January , as a Michigan native weaned on the Bad Boys , he 's a perfect fit . // The Pistons are not just an in-your-face team ; they 're an in-each-others ' - faces team . It 's not uncommon for Billups and Hamilton , the league 's most coordinated backcourt combo , to holler and angrily gesture at each other on the court , or for Wallace to flap his arms and rail against a teammate for a missed assignment . " We get mad at each other for maybe a minute , " says Billups , " then it 's over . " During a film session last Saturday the entire team goofed on Hamilton when a clip showed him looking for his shot despite the presence of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticizer " rather than single someone out ; on Sunday he said that Hamilton " blew " a defensive assignment that allowed Bulls guard Ben Gordon a wide-open three with 3:19 left that salted the game away . // The calling-out of players is a legacy of Brown 's . " L.B. always held the individual , not the team , accountable , and we do the same thing , " says Billups . " Instead of saying , ' We got ta move the ball better , ' we say , ' Chauncey , quit f -- -ing around with the ball , ' or , ' Rasheed , you 're being lazy , let 's get it together . ' We 're veterans . We can handle it . " // But can the Pistons handle the challenge as well as they did in 2004 ? The play of DJ Sheed will go a long way to determine whether Detroit can get back to being Title Town or will settle for being merely Funkytown. // Lucky Seven ? // Was there a silver lining in the Pistons ' loss at Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the six other teams that started 7 -- 0 , five won the title ; of the four that went 8 -- 0 or better , only two did .
