<p> Isla Holbox , Mexico  --  <p> He 's the guy everybody will be talking about at his high school reunion . <p> Every cubicle monkey wants to find a way to make a decent living doing something that does n't look a lot like work , preferably in some exotic locale . <p> Sky Lantz-Wagner , a 27-year-old entrepreneur from Marietta , has actually done it . <p> The University of Georgia graduate  --  he has a degree in international business  --  has co-founded a company , Dove6 , that is turning some serious pesos in its first year by taking well-heeled tourists to swim with whale sharks in the wild off Isla Holbox along the Yucatan Peninsula . <p> " I do n't want to get rich doing this , but I want to make enough money to live comfortably as possible , " said Lantz-Wagner , who runs his business out of Cancun , about three hours south of Holbox by car . " If I can make money doing it , then great . " <p> So far , he 's making money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to see and snorkel with whale sharks . It is a trend likely to accelerate now that the Georgia Aquarium has four of the huge filter-feeding creatures , the biggest sharks on the planet . <p> The downtown Atlanta fish tank , the largest indoor aquarium in the world , will introduce more than 3 million people to whale sharks by year 's end . Some of those folks will likely want to see the creatures in the wild , and Holbox is the closest place in this hemisphere to find them . <p> " We hope that as interest in the whale shark grows , our business will grow , " Lantz-Wagner said . <p> His company makes it easy for Cancun tourists to get from their posh hotels to a " whale shark adventure " and then back to the comfort of their all-inclusive resort in a single 12-hour day  --  all for about $195 per person , lunch included . <p> So far this whale shark season  --  the big fish feed off Holbox from late May through early September  --  Lantz-Wagner and his business partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is 500 people this year and 1,000 next season . <p> How they did it <p> The two had worked together in the Cancun tourism business for about three years and decided to go on their own this year with Dove6 . They began their company with $4,000 from savings and a loan from a friend , spending the money on brochures , T-shirts and a Web site . They contract with local boat operators to obtain transportation to the feeding sites . <p> On a recent late July morning , Lantz-Wagner was escorting a boatload of Italian tourists  --  Europeans make up about 40 percent of his customers  --  from Holbox by 8:15 a.m . They had left their Cancun hotel three hours earlier and traveled through miles of low-lying jungle by minibus to get here . It would be another hour ride in an open-air " ponga , " the boat preferred by local fishermen , to get to the open-ocean area where dozens of whale sharks were feeding on tiny organisms called plankton . <p> There were dolphins and even a few manta rays to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge , rounded dorsal fin . The boat slowed ; the Italian tourists were on their feet . And then , suddenly , there it was : a stunning , 25-foot whale shark just off the bow at the water 's surface , its skin glistening with its distinct polka dots . <p> " Bellissimo ! Very beautiful ! , " the Italians shouted . <p> Within minutes , two of the wide-eyed tourists donned masks and swim fins and were in the water with Lantz-Wagner , who is fluent in Italian and Spanish , swimming alongside the huge , gentle animal as it fed , seemingly oblivious to the gawking humans . <p> Everybody got a couple of turns swimming with the sharks over the next few hours , and then it was back to Holbox for a lunch of ceviche , chicken and homemade ice cream at a beachside , open-air cafe . <p> Relaxation for tourists <p> Daniela Jeimboni came along with husband Paolo and their 8-year-old son , Nicholos . The full-time mom has a shark tattoo on her left arm and a turtle tattoo on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear Louis Vuitton tote . She had seen a brochure for Lantz-Wagner 's company at her Cancun hotel and immediately signed up for the trip . <p> " I love everything to do with the sea , " she said . " And these are animals you only see on documentaries on the TV . I have watched many documentaries on TV . I try to go on vacation where I can see beautiful fish . " <p> Jeimboni said she found her up-close encounter with the big sharks more relaxing than she anticipated . <p> " They are very gentle creatures , " she smiled . <p> Lantz-Wagner 's new enterprise is not a venture without worry . Some tourists panic when they actually see a whale shark in the wild and wo n't get into the water . <p> Then there 's always the possibility the paying guests wo n't see a shark . That has n't happened so far ; the sharks are off Holbox in the hundreds this year . But if they are a no-show , guests get half their money back . <p> High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides and tourists  --  that runs about $1,200 a year  --  and the high costs associated with subcontracting with tour boats , bus drivers and restaurants . <p> " We do have high expenses since we outsource everything , " Lantz-Wagner said . " We figure our break-even point is about 100 customers , which we passed early in the season . " <p> Weather , too , " is a huge concern , " he said . " The whale sharks are here during hurricane season . A big storm would not be good for us . " <p> His job also means being away from his steady girlfriend , who lives in Vinings , during the whale shark summer season . <p> Lantz-Wagner hopes to clear enough money by season 's end in September to spend the off months back in Atlanta working on a plan to expand Dove6 . He wants to offer other ecotours along the so-called Mayan Riviera and possibly transform the business into a year-round venture . <p> " But if I have to get a job back in Atlanta , that 's fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone getting ready to take the plunge with their own business . He said it 's critical to work in a similar business owned by someone else first . That 's what he did for a few years . <p> " Before I started working down here I did n't know what a whale shark was , " he said . " Working for someone else down here first helped me make the contacts I had to make and it helped me make them mesh with our new company . It was vital . " <p> Lantz-Wagner said he wants to maintain his current course for at least five years . <p> " If it goes well and we continue to grow the business , I could see it being a long-term job , " he said . " Right now , we 're still testing the waters . But things look good so far .
