<p> When the Orinda Theater opened on Dec. 27 , 1941 , with a double feature of " The Maltese Falcon " and " Tarzan 's Secret Treasure , " no one in a town of farms and rural retreats could have predicted the high drama that would occur off the big screen . <p> No one could have guessed they were in one of the last popcorn palaces to be built during a golden age , before the dawn of strip-mall cinemas and multiplexes . <p> Or that a 9-year-old boy named Clark sitting near the back would , having grown up to be the area 's biggest developer , lose millions and nearly ruin his career trying to get rid of the theater . <p> Or that the fight to save it would reach the state Supreme Court , propel the current mayor into public life and inspire residents to seize local control . <p> Just about everybody in the East Bay has seen the theater - its dorsal-fin sign and marquee a familiar sight for Highway 24 commuters and a neon beacon for homeward-bound Orindans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of a community ? <p> This story begins with two men of action from Piedmont who looked to Lamorinda ( Lafayette , Orinda and Moraga ) and saw gold in a growing suburbia . One dreamed about movie palaces ; the other would end up having nightmares about them . <p> The first was Donald Rheem , whose father , William , was once president of Standard Oil , and who made his money in galvanizing plants . Rheem and his wife , Alice , moved from Piedmont to a 16-acre Moraga ranch in 1934 . Within a few years , Rheem turned the Spanish-style home into a Xanadulike estate where he entertained the famous . <p> Rheem would acquire land throughout Lamorinda - more than 1,500 acres at one point . While he made his biggest moves in Moraga , he forever changed Orinda in 1937 by purchasing land at what was known , even then , as the Orinda Crossroads . <p> Rheem spent $400,000 and hired big names for a Tinseltown tribute in Streamline Moderne - a stripped-down , later phase of Art Deco marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steel , stucco and neon . <p> The theater was designed by Alexander Aimwell Cantin , an associate of legendary San Francisco architect Timothy Pflueger . Cantin also crafted the Royal , Castro and Alhambra theaters in San Francisco and the Fox in Oakland , as well as Alhambra High School in Martinez and the Rheem Theater in Moraga . <p> Anthony Heinsbergen , who decked the walls of more than 750 theaters , including Oakland 's Paramount , and was once the subject of a touring Smithsonian Institution exhibition , created opulent murals with bare-breasted maidens , some inspired by his wife . <p> But by the 1970s , the theater was neglected and its style was unappreciated : Art Deco reminded some of the Depression ; its big screen showed second-run flicks that few attended . That 's where the second action man , Clark Wallace , stepped in and made the biggest mistake of his life . <p> A man with a plan <p> Wallace , a trim , 69-year-old fly fisherman whose Orinda home has the city 's best view - Lafayette Reservoir below , Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in land development , and once was California 's real estate commissioner . He also served two terms on the local school board and was president of the Chamber of Commerce . <p> He is well-liked around Orinda , according to people who have worked with him , due to his integrity and - because everyone feels for the fall guy - due to his big loss in the theater fight . <p> Wallace 's father , Ed , and grandfather , Will , opened a real estate office in 1928 and moved it to Orinda a decade later . " Dad figured this was going to be more than a country-home retreat , " said Wallace . He agreed , joined the brokerage in 1958 and , on a fishing trip nine years later , convinced dad he was ready to take over . <p> " I was Orinda Citizen of the Year in ' 69 , " said Wallace , " and Godzilla by ' 72 because of all the development I was involved in . " <p> When Wallace first considered razing the theater in the late 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents with a modern office and shopping complex . " People were complaining they had to go to Walnut Creek to shop , " he said . " I thought , I can be a hero . ' " <p> He planned a 116,000-square-foot complex that " did n't make economic sense unless I tore down the theater . " He bought the 4-acre block in 1982 , wary of opposition but confident : He had just completed Pine Grove , an office complex just across Highway 24 , despite heavy opposition and a lawsuit . Most important , he figured he knew better than his foes . <p> He figured wrong . " I think I went to 73 public hearings in the next four years , " he said . <p> The Friends <p> Orinda Mayor Laura Abrams , a 54-year-old real estate agent and 30-year resident , is easygoing but plucky . She has a master 's degree in business and comes from " a family of fairly aggressive types , " she said . <p> Abrams , who now works across the street from the theater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or early 1982 , she said , and she went to see David Lynch 's " The Elephant Man , " and was fascinated by Heinsbergen 's murals . <p> Just weeks later , Abrams picked up a copy of the Orinda Sun and read about Wallace 's plans . She envisioned her adopted town losing one of its biggest assets . " It was an obscenity to consider , " she said . <p> So she attended a meeting of the new Friends of Orinda Theater in the town 's community center . When she left , she was publicity director and had accepted what would become a full-time job . <p> Abrams was just one of many preservationists . Friends of Orinda Theater was also led by former city staffer and journalist Ann Jenkins , art agent Nina Horn , attorney Carl Weber and the late Diane Bowie . <p> They were resourceful , tough and persistent , willing to sit for hours in a public meeting for five minutes of speaking time , to hold bake sales and beg for donations in a town still split on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community meeting . " You 're going to lose on this , " she warned . " The community is not going to let this happen . " <p> But Wallace was serene - and somewhat brash publicly . Although the theater was nominated by the state for the National Register of Historic Places in August 1982 , Wallace 's permission was needed . " It 's a monolithic mausoleum , " he said of the theater during a January 1983 meeting with the chambers of commerce of Orinda , Moraga and Lafayette . " It 's ugly and has no aesthetic value whatsoever . " <p> Taking it to court <p> In August 1984 , Contra Costa County supervisors approved Wallace 's project , now five stories and 108,000 square feet , plus three interior mini-theaters to replace the palace . <p> The race was on : Wallace removed tenants and , in October , closed the theater with " The Big Chill " and " Moscow on the Hudson . " His opponents sued . The Friends argued that Wallace had n't sought alternatives to a plan that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association , a quasi-governmental body that sat under county supervisors , arguing not that the theater was priceless but that the development 's height and density violated town ordinances . " If the theater was saved , all the better , " said Jim Roethe , a lawyer who was president of the association and lead counsel . <p> County Superior Court Judge Max Wilcox Jr. , a former Orinda resident , ruled in favor of Wallace in February 1985 . The two community groups appealed , but Wallace - losing money by the day - wanted to demolish the building before a ruling by the Court of Appeals . <p> On March 28 , the appeals court said it would drop a stay of demolition in 24 hours , as the case to keep the theater was likely to be lost . The only option was an emergency request to the California Supreme Court . It was filed at 9 a.m. the next day . <p> Horn , an artist and art agent , remembers standing on a pedestrian bridge taking memorial pictures of the theater that day . Abrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept her doors open to listen for bulldozers . " I told them to let us know if they start moving , " said Gail Hillenbrand , an attorney then with McCutchen , Doyle , Brown &; Enersen , which had taken the Friends ' case pro bono . <p> Late in the afternoon , Rose Bird 's court weighed in . Five of seven justices said to hold the wrecking ball . <p> More than a year later , after several failed settlement talks in and out of court , the appeals court told Wallace to go " back to the drawing board . " While the Supreme Court decision had rested on the Friends , the appeals court validated the Orinda Association . <p> After all the fighting and the legal ups and downs , and for all the opinions of Art Deco experts , art preservationists and theater historians , the proposed building was just too tall . <p> City of celluloid <p> Wallace knew he was in big trouble . Everything had changed in Orinda . <p> The theater fight had strengthened activism in the town and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a 2-1 margin in 1967 - a 1974 bid did n't even get to the ballot - they seized local control in March 1985 . <p> " The community was changing and recognizing the value of its resources , " Abrams said . " Now we do n't let people build on the ridges or close to the creeks . It 's an extension of that same attitude . " <p> " I was toast , " Wallace said . " Now I had to go back not to the friendly confines of the Board of Supervisors , but to a new City Council , of which four members were openly opposed to tearing down the theater . " <p> Looking back , Wallace said he should have abandoned his project earlier , but , " There 's an axiom in this business : You get in so deep the only way you can get out is to build your way out . " <p> The result was a 90,000-square-foot compromise - 35,000 square feet of retail space suitable for small specialty stores and cafes ( all but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40,000 square feet of office space and an underground parking garage . It was also a disaster for Wallace in almost every way . <p> Keeping the theater doubled his construction costs while the retail market had gone south during the fight . The theater kept the prime spot on the square , but any operator would not be able to afford competitive rent . <p> The final blow : Wallace had to pay $1.3 million to restore the time-ravaged theater - mushrooms grew on the floor , mold on the murals - and make it earthquake-safe before a grand reopening . " Casablanca " marked the start of a new era on June 29 , 1989 . <p> About a year later , McMorgan &; Co. , an investment firm , foreclosed on Wallace , who - having bought out his partners earlier - shouldered " a few million dollars " in lost capital and seized assets . It was part of a string of bad luck that Wallace estimates cost him $12 million in three or four years . He lost everything but his house and family . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old and scraping bottom , " Wallace said . His wife , Gerry , now 68 , went back to work as a ceramicist , and Wallace in 1994 stepped down as Gov . Pete Wilson 's real estate commissioner in order to fix his affairs - and avoid embarrassing the governor . <p> " These are n't happy times , but it is what it is , " he said recently . " It 's the nature of the business . It 's high risk and high reward and high loss sometimes . This happened to be the biggest personal loss . " <p> No hard feelings <p> Wallace recovered , thanks in part to the Otis Spunkmeyer cookie company , which hired him to launch a real estate asset division , and he is involved in developing several projects in Northern California . He said he has no hard feelings for the preservationists he once dubbed " Laura and the Lynchers . " <p> " They did what they believed in , " Wallace said . " I just did n't agree with them . " <p> Abrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would I have run for public office if I had n't done the theater fight ? Definitely not , " she said . " Would I have been elected ? Definitely not . People knew me , and people in Orinda have a long memory . " <p> Orinda Theater Square , meanwhile , is beloved but remains , in some ways , the economic trouble spot that Wallace predicted it would be . Merchants - and property managers - have come and gone , and a recent stroll through the center found seven empty storefronts . <p> Current tenants include the recently installed Starbucks and a High Tech Burrito , a salon , a flower shop and a couple of small restaurants , and places to buy chichi pet gifts , custom kitchens , toys , leather bags and jewelry . <p> ScanlanKemperBard , a real estate merchant banking firm out of Portland , Ore. , bought the block in September 2000 . Chief Operating Officer James Kessler said , " I think it 's finally at a point where it can be successful . . . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 percent of the retail space is vacant , but new tenants are coming , including a spa offering massages , facials and Chardonnay . <p> The theater , operated by Renaissance Rialto of Oakland - which also runs the Park in Lafayette , the Oaks in Berkeley and the Grand Lake in Oakland - has only sold out its 750-seat big screen once , while showing the latest Harry Potter movie . But the palace - which a few years ago added two smaller screens - makes a small profit , said Renaissance Rialto owner Alan Michaan . <p> Most importantly , it 's no multiplex . The popcorn and pop is cheaper , and the staff is in love with movies . <p> " It 's nice to work at a place you 're proud of , " said projectionist Chris Rasmussen , 41 . " This is real . " <p> In a final twist , Michaan had ended up being hired by Wallace to run the theater even though he had called Wallace a " cultural vandal " at a public meeting in the early ' 80s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Michaan said . <p> Orinda 's relationship with its theater is something quite different : unconditional love.E-mail Demian Bulwa at dbulwa@sfchronicle.com.
