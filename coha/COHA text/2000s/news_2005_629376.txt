<p> The memory of the attack no longer pains Julie Hollas the most . Instead , it 's the small and unexpected ways the violence and fear of those few hours have woven themselves into her daily life . <p> She does n't like to leave home at night . She shrinks from hugs - even from her 7-year-old son - if hands come close to her neck . She can not stand the smell of sweat . <p> " If Greg has been working in the garden , he has to take a shower before he can even kiss me hello , " Hollas said of her husband of nearly 10 years . " Because it will bring back a fear . I go through it again . " <p> Charles Daniel Thacker was already a convicted rapist when , Hollas says , he sexually assaulted her Feb. 17 , 1993 . Thacker was arrested two months later , after strangling Klein schoolteacher Karen Gail Crawford during an attempted rape , and convicted of capital murder . <p> He is scheduled to die tonight . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollas ' attack never went to trial . But lawyers familiar with the case say Hollas ' testimony was key in the conviction . Thacker and his attorney refused to comment for this article . <p> Memories remain vivid <p> Hollas and her husband plan to be in Huntsville tonight but are not going to witness the execution . Hollas said she is torn over the issue of capital punishment , even more so now because of her involvement in the Thacker case . <p> " On the one hand , I feel sorry that he has to die , " she said . " On the other hand , I want him to fry . <p> " I want to know he is sorry , that he has repented . I want to know when he dies , where is he going ? That 's what 's tearing me up inside . " <p> Hollas , who was 23 at the time of the trial , remembers being asked by Thacker 's defense attorney if she was certain that he was her attacker . Hollas said she turned and faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will never forget his face until the day I die . ' " <p> And she has n't , Hollas said . With the execution 's approach , the 34-year-old mother has looked back with mixed emotions over her long struggle to rebuild her life . She spoke with the Chronicle and insisted that her name be used because she wants others to benefit from her experience and , she said , using her name " makes it more real . " <p> In 1993 , Hollas was Julie Bowlby and she lived in Tomball . On her way home Feb. 17 , she stopped to get her mail in front of her apartment building . <p> When she got back into her van and tried to close the door , it swung open . A man climbed in and shoved her into the passenger seat , Hollas recalled . He was armed with a knife . <p> " As soon as he drove off he started to rip at my clothing , " Hollas said . " In my head I was thinking , I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sweat . <p> " He smelled , " she said . " He just smelled , he was dirty . " <p> The man drove behind a nearby senior citizen 's center , down a dead-end street by an empty field . <p> " I wo n't hurt you , I wo n't hurt you , " Hollas remembered him saying . When she looked at the dashboard glow , the clock flashed 7:14 p.m . <p> Hollas did n't fight back until his hands were around her neck and he began to squeeze . <p> " I just know he did n't put his hands around me for any other reason other than to kill me , " she said . <p> She slapped his hands away . " I would have told him anything just to live , " she said . Hollas told him that since they had been sitting in the dark she had n't seen his face . She told him to wipe the van clean of any possible fingerprints and that she would n't go to the police . <p> He threw the keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . She sat quietly for a moment before groping outside for the keys . She drove home , intending to take a shower , go to bed and forget the night ever happened . <p> Her mother persuaded her to go to the police , and several months later , Thacker was arrested in the slaying of Crawford , a 26-year-old second-grade teacher . Hollas was asked to testify ; news reports described her testimony as " powerful . " <p> The killer was given the death penalty . <p> Climbing back up <p> Hollas ' true fight began after the trial . Remembering still brings tears to her eyes . <p> " Looking back now I feel sorry for who that person was , " she said from her north Houston home . " I feel sorry for what she was feeling at that time . " <p> Depression set in . Unable to bring herself to leave her apartment , Hollas lost her job . Soon she was on public assistance , worried about keeping the lights on and feeding herself . <p> In a way she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was trapped in the van . <p> " I was just trying to live . I was just trying to have a life of some sort , " she said . " I was just worried about where the money was going to come from . There were times when I did not have electricity . " <p> But at her core , there was a part of Hollas that no attack could touch . Hollas called it stubbornness , and she used it to push herself back onto her feet . <p> " I did n't have a choice to become a victim , " she said . " But it was up to me to become a survivor . " <p> Hollas started going to counseling and began taking antidepressants . She became active in her church , where the members rallied around her and helped her find a new job . <p> And , through mutual friends , she met Greg Hollas . <p> " When we met , we hated each other , " she remembered with a laugh . " He thought I was rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like each other . " <p> Experience had hardened her , she acknowledged , but she soon saw that Greg had the capacity to see the world in a way that she no longer could . Greg could still be trusting . <p> " I really needed someone like that , " she said . " I still need that today . I still need reassurance . But no matter how bad things get , he still loves me for me . " <p> Julie and Greg married in 1997 . <p> Hollas kept climbing . <p> The couple had a son . She had whole years where things would seem dark and she would lash out at her loved ones . At one point her doctor threatened to have her hospitalized . She kept climbing . <p> Greg countered her ill-temper with patience . <p> " God put him in my life and he is the one I was supposed to be with , " she said . " Who else would put up with my bitchiness ? " <p> Life may never be easy for Hollas , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and realized she had come a long way . <p> " I 'm not that same person anymore , " she said . " I 've come so far . It makes me proud of myself today . " <p> Coming to terms <p> Despite her struggles with those small daily reminders , Hollas two years ago began speaking on panels organized by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice . During the talks she recounts the attack for prisoners and TDCJ officials . <p> " You try and make it as real as possible for them , " she said . " The attack itself is not what bothers me the most . It was an event , it happened . " <p> At one recent talk , a prisoner stood and thanked her . He told her he had never thought about the victims of crimes before . <p> " He now realizes that whatever his crime was , he now realizes what that did to his victims , " she recalled . <p> Thinking about that exchange , Hollas marvels at the course of her life .
