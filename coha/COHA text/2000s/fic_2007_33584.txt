Chapter One At the exact moment the cash register dings and I open my change purse , the chain of bells on the front door of the coffee shop bangs together with a brassy clatter . I hear the sound of voices raised in greetings , a loud and hearty hello in response , and the bells jangling again as the door closes . Curious to see who 's making such an entrance , I glance over my shoulder . When I see that it 's Son Rodgers , my face flames and my heart pounds . On top of everything else that 's happened today , I go to the coffee shop for lunch , and who do I run into ? One thing for sure : I have to get out of here before he sees me . It would be embarrassing for me and him and the dozen or so other folks enjoying their afternoon coffee . Instinctively , I duck my head and pull my arms close as if to make myself invisible . Barely turning my head , I look over my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . No way I can get out that way without him seeing me ; I 'll have to exit through the bookstore . Now I wish I 'd driven to town instead of walking , even though it would 've been ridiculous to drive so few blocks . But my getaway would have been easier . I could have gone through the adjoining bookstore , gotten nonchalantly into my car , and put the pedal to the metal . Instead , everyone in both stores will see me running out of the coffee shop right after my best friend 's husband has walked in . I can only imagine the talk that will follow , since our small town has talked of little else all summer except what 's gone on in the Rodgers household . I can hear it now : " Did you know it 's gotten so bad that Clare sneaked out of the coffee shop to avoid Son ? Poor Dory ! " Making my getaway is turning out to be more difficult than I thought . The lethargic , bespectacled teenager behind the counter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know the ropes yet . He takes his time wrapping the two slices of carrot cake in parchment paper , placing them in a flat white box , then bringing the edges of the box together . When I see him searching for tape , I say , " It 's fine . Do n't bother taping it , " and hope that my voice does n't sound as flustered as I feel . But he shrugs me off and says no problem , it 's no trouble at all . He rings it up wrong for the second time , muttering , " Oops . " After canceling out the sale , he punches in the numbers again , glances at me over the top of his glasses , and mumbles , " Uh , that 'll be eight fifty-three . " It hits me that I used all my change by counting out the exact amount for the veggie wrap and iced tea I had for lunch , plus a tip ; I left the money on the table , anchoring my ticket . On my way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of carrot cake with me , and I stopped at the counter to place my order . I have nothing but a twenty to pay with . Another glance over my shoulder , and I toss the twenty-dollar bill at Pokey . In a low voice , I say , " If you could hurry , I 'd really appreciate it . I 'm running late for an appointment . " Of course , I speak too softly , trying to keep Son from hearing my voice , and Pokey tilts his head sideways to say , " Ma'am ? " " Hurry with the change , please , " I hiss . From the corner of my eye , I see that Son is working the room like a politician running for reelection , slapping backs and grinning like the Cheshire cat . His greetings are met with cries of " Hey-look who 's back in town ! " and " Son ! How was your trip ? When did you get home ? " I watch him lean over to kiss the cheek of a plump , white-haired lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face in something resembling the ecstasy of Saint Teresa . He then joins a couple of businessmen from the bank who get to their feet to shake his hand and pound his back with great vigor , buying me a few seconds . Son throws back his head to laugh at something one of them says , which gives me a chance for a furtive study of him . I have n't seen him all summer , the longest span of time since he and Dory married , and that was twenty-five years ago . Son is casually dressed in crisp , pressed jeans and a white oxford-cloth shirt , the sleeves carelessly rolled up to reveal brown , well-muscled arms . Usually he 's in a shirt and tie , as befitting such a highly regarded and important hotshot . I guess he has n't yet gone back to work in his real estate business , since he and Dory have been home only a couple of days . Even though he has a hand on the shoulder of one of the businessmen and appears to be listening with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to make sure he 's kissed up to everyone there . When his gaze comes my way , I turn my head quickly , almost dropping the bills and change that Pokey is counting into my outstretched hand . When he miscounts and starts over , I 'm tempted to tell the poor fellow to keep it , even if it would make me the biggest tipper in town . He 'd probably be so surprised that he 'd ask me to repeat myself yet again , and I 'd end up getting caught by Son after all . With his scrutiny of the coffee shop , it 's unbelievable that Son has n't recognized me yet , even with my back to him and the counter located at a helpful angle . It occurs to me that he has n't seen me since I 've had my hair cut . From the first day we met , Son has gone on and on about what great hair I have . It 's nothing but his usual empty flattery , the only way he knows to relate to women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been unruly and difficult . After struggling with it all my life , I gave up and had it chopped off a few weeks ago . Everybody tells me I look like a different person with my mass of hair gone , which must be true . Even so , I 'm not taking any chances , not with the way Son keeps looking everyone over , so I drop the change into my briefcase instead of in my purse . Thankfully , the door of the adjoining bookstore is only a few feet away . I 've taken a step away from the counter when the young man clears his throat and says in a loud voice , " Uh-ma'am ? " My cheeks burning , I turn to see him holding out the box with the carrot cake in it . I yank it out of his hand so quickly that his eyes widen in surprise and his Adam 's apple jerks up and down . I feel bad for him , but not as bad as he would feel if Son saw me and caused a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good way to end his first day at work . In the Page and Palette bookstore , a glance assures me that the salesclerk is helping a customer in the back , so I step behind a revolving display of paperbacks in order to peer into the coffee shop , making sure I got away without being seen . To my relief , I 've escaped : Son is still standing with the two businessmen and running his mouth , with a big grin on his face . The three of them bend their heads together as he relates something , and they all laugh appreciatively , slapping backs again . Satisfied that I 've escaped undetected , I sling the strap of my briefcase over my shoulder and tuck the box of carrot cake under my arm , then head toward the front door . Once I 'm outside , I 'm surprised to find the sidewalks still crowded with shoppers and sightseers , which is unusual for early fall . Anxious to get away from the coffee shop , I mutter my apologies as I make my way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although off the beaten path , Fairhope is becoming more and more of a tourist attraction , and it 's not unusual to have several tour buses in town during the summer , but not this time of year . In an effort to avoid a cluster of people blocking the sidewalk in front of one of the street 's many art galleries , I cut through a group of charming and colorful little shops that make up the area known as the French Quarter . And that 's where I run into Rye Ballenger , quite literally . If I had n't been hugging the bakery box so close , carrot cake would have gone flying . " Clare ! " he exclaims at the same time I gasp , " Rye ! " Then both of us say together , " What are you doing here ? " I link an arm into his and continue my walk , pulling Rye along with me down the brick-paved lane . Out of the corner of my mouth , I say to him in a low voice , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop so I wo n't be seen by a certain person who just walked in . " Rye plays along with me , matching my stride . " Who is it ? " he whispers dramatically , looking around in mock terror . " An ex-husband of one of your clients ? " " Actually , you 're close , " I say with a groan . " It 's Son . " " Son ! " Rye comes to such an abrupt halt that I almost trip over a protruding brick . " Did he say anything to you ? Tell me the truth . " " He did n't see me , thank God . I hightailed it out of there as fast as I could . Something tells me I 'm not on his list of favorite people right now . " With a frown , Rye studies my face . He disengages my arm in order to take my hand in both of his and squeeze it tight . " Why do n't you go back and confront him , sweetheart ? I 'll go with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him bullying you , and he needs to hear that . " " Your problem is , you 're much too gallant , " I say with an affectionate smile . " Charging in on your white horse and defending the honor of the poor maiden . " He snorts with indignation , his color high . " I 've never been on a horse in my life , and have no intention of ever doing so . But I hate missing the chance to give Son Rodgers a piece of my mind . " " All I want to do is avoid him , " I assure him . " I 'm not interested in a confrontation at this point . Especially now , with him and Dory back together . " " Still no idea how that miraculous event came about ? " Rye asks , watching me curiously . I shrug . " None whatsoever . But I 'll see Dory tomorrow at the group meeting , and she 's promised me that we 'll talk beforehand . Have you " Before I realize what 's happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out of the way of a large gray-haired woman who barges past us , then turns back to scowl at us for blocking the sidewalk . As we watch her walk away , I send up a thank-you to whatever gods were responsible for sending Rye strolling through the French Quarter at the very moment I turned the corner . From the first day I arrived in Fairhope , the sardonic and irreverent Rye Ballenger has been one of my dearest friends , and there 's no one I 'd rather see now , after the near miss with Son . Certainly no one else understands my history with Son better than Rye does . He and I move to stand under the jasmine-entwined arbor of a caf , then Rye leans toward me to whisper in my ear , " Lord God Almighty , would you look at that ! How ghastly . " He nods toward the retreating woman , who 's clad in a hot-pink T-shirt with flowered capri pants stretched way too tight across her very ample rear end . " I can promise you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What gives her away ? " I ask with a grin , pushing my sunglasses on top of my head . " The camera hanging around her neck or the Gulf Shores T-shirt ? " Brow furrowed , Rye shudders and says , " Come on , Clare . No self-respecting Southern belle would be caught dead wearing white socks with sandals , and you know it . It 's a disgrace , that 's what it is . If they are going to run us off our lovely streets , the least they could do is dress properly . " " You 're such a snob , " I say fondly . " But you know what ? I think you love it . You work hard at being the biggest snob in Baldwin County , do n't you ? " Pretending to be offended , he pulls back and drawls in his melodious , honey-toned voice , " I just happen to have my standards , is all . " When I first met the courtly Ryman Ballenger , a cousin of my former husband 's , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the most pronounced Southern accent I 've ever heard , and on the Eastern Shore of Alabama , that 's saying a lot . It suits him , though , just another of his many charms . In addition to being the most breathtakingly handsome man I 've ever had the pleasure of knowing , Rye is also the most elegant . He 's always seemed out of place in this offbeat , artsy little town . He should be strolling the lavish grounds of an English estate instead , trailed by a bevy of manservants and Cavalier King Charles spaniels . " It 's strange that I ran into you just as I was running out of the coffee shop , " I say , gazing up at him . Rye is one of those people I enjoy just looking at , in the same way I might stop by an art gallery and admire a painting . " Do n't tell me you walked to town . " In all the years I 've known him , I 've never seen him walk anywhere . He 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looks at me as though I 've lost my mind . " Me walk to town ? In this heat ? I should hope not . " With a nod , he indicates a place across the street . " My car 's over there . I almost never found a parking place in this damn mob . " He points out a small shop on the corner . " I came down to pick up a print that Lou framed for me . But the mat did n't suit me , so I had her redo it . " " Not up to your standards , huh ? " I tease him . Rye studies me through long dark lashes , and his fine gray eyes go soft . " I ca n't tell you how happy I am to see you . I called your cell phone not five minutes ago . " With a grimace , I admit that I turned it off when I left the office . " You know how hard it is for me to close shop on Friday afternoons . Etta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning for some unfinished paperwork . If I 'd kept my cell turned on and one of my clients called , having a crisis , I would 've had to go running back to meet them there . " He clucks his tongue in reproach . " Ah , Clare , what am I going to do with you ? You promised me that you 'd stop giving your private numbers to your clients ! " " I know ... " My voice trails off , and I look up at him helplessly . He places a hand on my shoulder . " When you did n't answer your cell , I got concerned about you , after what happened this morning . " " You concerned about me ? That 's a switch , since I 'm officially the one who gets to worry about everybody else . It 's in my job description . " " You can worry your pretty head off about whomever you want , my dear Clare , but I 'm in charge of you . " " How very touching , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume you 're referring to a certain letter in this morning 's paper ? " " So you 've seen it ? " With a worried frown , Rye reaches into his pocket and pulls out a clipping . " I have it with me , so if anyone dares to say anything about it , I can tell them what a bunch of hogwash it is . " " I 've seen it , " I tell him dismally . I arrived at my office early this morning , bringing the local paper to read while waiting for my first client . Like most weeklies , The Fairhoper is the perfect antidote to the grim headlines of the national news . Unless we 've had one of our infamous hurricanes , the articles are full of small-town dramas that can be heartwarming but are more often unintentionally comic . Dory and I will call each other to read some of the more priceless ones aloud . Her favorite remains the obituary written about a certain Mr. McMillan , who is said to have died in his sleep so peacefully that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The human interest stories are usually pretty good , but last month I was embarrassed to find myself named Fairhope 's Citizen of the Month . To my further embarrassment , one of this morning 's letters to the editor , which I read in dismay , referred to my award : This letter is written to protest your choice of August 's Citizen of the Month , a self-proclaimed divorce " coach . " The honor was based on the national attention that has come this woman 's way , praising her innovative methods of divorce recovery . I have to wonder if those retreats of hers , held right here in our own conference center , actually do more to promote divorces than to help people get over them . Surely if folks were encouraged to work on their marriages instead , the disgracefully high divorce rates in our country would go down . I hope next month 's choice will better reflect the ideals of our community and country . The letter was signed by Oscar T. Allen , a " concerned " citizen whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rye stands with his hands on his hips , scowling . " I ca n't tell you how furious I am . And you 've got to be , too , though you wo n't let on . I know how you operate . In spite of all your degrees , you hide your feelings like the rest of us . " " You know better than that . " I ca n't resist adding with a sly smile , " I 'd never hide my feelings from you . " " Ha ! " he scoffs . " You could 've fooled me . " " You 've lived here all your life , and you know everyone in town , so tell me who Oscar T. Allen is. " (
