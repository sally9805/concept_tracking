A longtime fan and reader , he coedits the fanzine Bento with his wife , Kate Yule . You can find the fanzine online at www.BentoPress.com . If you 're wondering , this story was not written with any foreknowledge of Barry Malzberg 's essay , but the temptation of running it in the same issue proved irresistible . <p> THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A BIRD . A bird , a ship , a machine , a woman - she was all these things , and none , but first and fundamentally a bird . It is also a story about a man - a gambler , a liar , and a cheat , but only for the best of reasons . No doubt you know the famous Portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose eyes have been described as " two pools of sadness iced over with determination . " This is the story behind that painting . It is a love story . It is a sad story . And it is true . The story begins in a time before shiftspace , before Conner and Hua , even before the caster people . The beginning of the story lies in the time of the bird ships . Before the bird ships , just to go from one star to another , people either had to give up their whole lives and hope their children 's children would remember why they had come , or freeze themselves and hope they could be thawed at the other end . Then the man called Doctor Jay made a great and horrible discovery : he learned that a living mind could change the shape of space . He found a way to weld a human brain to the keel of a starship , in such a way that the ship could travel from star to star in months instead of years . After the execution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain called the visual cortex was the key to changing the shape of space . And so they found a creature whose brain was almost all visual cortex , the Aquila chiysaetos , or as it was known in those days , the golden eagle . This was a bird that has been lost to us ; it had wings broader than a tall man is tall , golden brown feathers long and light as a lover 's touch , and eyes black and sharp as a clear winter night . But to the people of this time it was just another animal , and they did not appreciate it while they had it . They took the egg of a golden eagle , and they hatched it in a warm box , and they let it fly and learn and grow , and then they killed it . And they took its brain and they placed it at the top of a cunning construction of plastic and silicon which gave it the intelligence of a human , and this they welded to the keel of the starship . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird the intelligence of a human , only to enslave its brain , as it is to take the brain of a human and enslave that . And so it is . But the people of this time drew a rigid distinction between born-people and made-people , and to them this seemed only just and right . Now it happens that one golden eagle brain , which was called Nerissa Zeebnen-Fearsig , was installed into a ship of surpassing beauty . It was a great broad shining arrowhead of silver metal , this ship , filigreed and inlaid with gold , and filled with clever and intricate mechanisms of subtle pleasure . The ship traveled many thousands of light-years in the service of many captains . Love affairs and assassinations were planned and executed within its silver hull ; it was used for a time as an emperor 's private yacht ; it even carried Magister Ai on part of his expedition to the Forgotten Worlds . But Nerissa the shipbrain saw none of these things , for she had been given eyes that saw only outward . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feel of their hands on her controls . When the ship was under way , Nerissa felt the joy of flight , a pure unthinking joy she remembered from her time as a creature of muscle and feather . But most of her time was spent contemplating the silent stars or the wall of some dock , awaiting the whim of her owner and master . Over the years the masters " voices changed . Cultured tones accustomed to command were replaced by harsher , more unforgiving voices , and the ship 's rich appointments were removed one by one . In time even basic maintenance was postponed or disregarded , and Nerissa found herself more and more often in places of darkness and decay . She despaired , even feared for her life , but shipbrains had no rights . The strongest protest she was allowed was , " Sir and Master , that course of action may be inadvisable . " Finally the last and roughest owner , a man with grating voice and hard unsubtle hands , ran the ship into a docking probe in a foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air gushed out , and the man died , leaving a legacy so tattered and filthy that none could bear to touch it . Ownerless , airless , the hulk was towed to a wrecking yard and forgotten . Nerissa wept as the ship 's power failed , her vision fading to monochrome and then to black . Reduced to the barest reserves of energy , she fell into a deep uneasy sleep . While she slept the universe changed . Conner and Hua discovered shiftspace , and travel between planets became something the merely well-off could afford . The Clash of Cultures burst into full flower almost at once , as ten thousand faiths and religions and philosophies collided and mingled . It was a time of violence and strife , but in time a few ideas emerged as points of agreement , and one of these was that what had been done to the golden eagles was wrong . So the hatcheries were closed , the ships retired , and the shipbrains compassionately killed . All save one . One that slept forgotten in a wrecking yard orbiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Clash of Cultures gradually drew to a close as points of agreement grew and coalesced , eventually giving birth to Consensus . But much knowledge was lost , and so when a king 's tinker entered the wrecking yard and found the hulk of the great ship he had no idea what a unique treasure he had stumbled upon . He saw only the precious metal of the ship 's hull , and it was for this metal he purchased it for his master . As the ship was broken up , the tinker saved out a few of the most interesting-looking pieces for later use . One of these was the housing containing the sleeping brain of Nerissa Zeebnen-Fearsig . She felt a blinding pain as she was crudely torched from the ship 's keel , and she feared her end had come at last , but then the pain receded and she slept once more . Nerissa sat unconsidered for some years in one of the king 's many storerooms , surrounded by a thousand other dismembered devices . But then came a day when the tinker entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a likely-looking length of wire beneath a pile of dusty components , but when he pulled on it he found himself with a peculiar rounded thing that piqued his curiosity . He took it back to his workbench , where he puzzled out its contacts and connectors , its inputs and outputs , and finally he connected an ancient scavenged power unit and Nerissa returned to awareness . Waking was far more painful than being cut from the ship 's hull . A torrent of discordant colors and textures flooded her senses , but her screams went unheard for the tinker had not connected her voice . Instead , a series of meaningless numbers and letters stepped delicately onto a small display plate . The tinker was fascinated by this , and stayed up all that night , probing and prodding , trying to understand just what manner of machine he had found . Nerissa was nearly driven mad by the pain and the random sensations , and it was nothing but good fortune that when the tinker happened to hook up a voice unit to the proper outputs she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nihon , already an ancient language at the time of the bird ships , but still understood in the tinker 's time as it is today . He dropped his soldering iron in astonishment . Soon the tinker found Nerissa an eye and an ear and disconnected the probes that caused her the worst of the pain . They talked all that day , and he listened with apparent fascination to her description of her creation and her tales of her travels ; for the first time in many centuries Nerissa allowed herself to hope . But though he professed to believe her , privately he concluded she was merely a machine : a storytelling machine constructed to believe its own fictions . For he was not an educated man , and as he had worked with machines every day of his life he was unable to conceive that she might be anything else . Though he thought Nerissa was a machine , he recognized her intelligence and charm and decided to present her to his king as a special gift . He called together his apprentices and artisans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanoid body of the finest and most costly materials . Her structural elements were composite diamond fiber , stronger than her old hull ; her skin and hair were pure platinum , glowing with a subtle color deeper and finer than silver ; her eyes and her teeth were beryl and opal ; and all was assembled with the greatest of care and attention such that it moved as smoothly as any living thing . The one thing he did not do was to provide the body with any semblance of sexual organs . It may seem to you that this omission is callous and arbitrary , and so it is . But the people of this time thought such a thing would be unseemly . When the body was finished , Nerissa 's brain in its housing was placed gently in its chest and the many connections were made with great care and delicacy . Power was applied then , and Nerissa 's beautiful body of precious metals convulsed and twisted , her back arching and a horrible keening wail tearing from her amber lips . She begged to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodded , tweaked and adjusted , and gradually the pain ebbed away , leaving Nerissa trembling on its shore . The king was genuinely delighted with the tinker 's gift of " a storytelling machine , built from bits and pieces found here and there . " The tinker had warned him that Nerissa seemed to believe her own tales , and so he pretended to believe them too , but Nerissa knew when she was being humored . So she gave him made-up stories , as he expected , though most of them had a kernel of truth drawn from her own life . Now this king was a kind and wise man , truly appreciative of Nerissa , but he had many political problems and many enemies , so he rarely found time for her stories . After some months he found the sight of her , waiting patiently in his apartments , raised a pang of guilt that overwhelmed his joy at her beauty and grace . So he decided to gift Nerissa to an influential duke . In this way he hoped to put the man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps to gain Nerissa a more appreciative audience . So Nerissa joined the household of Duke Vey , in the city of Arica . The king 's plan met with great success ; the duke , well pleased with the king 's gift , spent many hours parading Nerissa before his friends and relations . All were suitably impressed by her stories , her charm , and her gleaming beauty , and the king 's tinker received many fine commissions from those who had seen her . One of those who saw her was Denali Eu . The son and heir of the famous trader Ranson Eu , Denali appeared but rarely in Arica . When he did visit the city he attended all the finest soirees , displaying his subtle wit and radiant wardrobe , and gambled flamboyantly . All agreed he shared his late father 's gambling skill , though lacking his extravagance and bravado . Of his travels , however , he let fall only the vaguest of hints . He liked to say his business dealings were like leri fruits , sensitive to the harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambled away his fortune , leaving his wife and only child shackled to a mountainous debt . Denali Eu had no ship , no travels , no servants . His time away from Arica was spent in a small and shabby house not far from town , the family 's last bit of property , where he and his mother Leona survived on hunting and a small vegetable garden . In the evenings they sewed Denali 's outfits for the next expedition to Arica , using refurbished and rearranged pieces from previous seasons . It is a tribute to Leona Eu 's talent and taste that Denali was often perceived as a fashion leader . It pained Denali to maintain this fiction . But he had no alternative , for as long as he was perceived as a prosperous trader his father 's creditors were content to circle far from the fire and dine on scraps . His social status also gave him access to useful information , which could sometimes be sold for cash , and gave him entree to high-stakes gambling venues . Ranson Eu had , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed both acumen and techniques on to his son . Denali often wished he could have returned the favor by passing his caution and temperance on to his father . It was across a spinning gambling wheel that Denali Eu first saw Nerissa Zeebnen-Fearsig . The lamplight glanced off her silver metal shoulder as a cat rubs against a leg , leaving both charged with electricity . Her unclothed body revealed every bit of the expense and quality of her manufacture . She stood with head tilted upward , her amber lips gently parted as she spoke to the taller Duke Vey beside her . " Who is that ? " asked Denali Eu to the woman beside him as he gathered his winnings . " It is the duke 's storytelling machine . Have you not seen it before ? " " No ... no , I have not . She 's beautiful . She must be worth millions . " " It 's priceless . It was a present from the king . " At that moment Eu made the first of three decisions that shaped the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to win Nerissa from the duke in a game of senec . Denali Eu was a keen observer of people , as he had to be given his situation , and he had often found himself seated across a senec table from Duke Vey . The duke , like many senec players , had a mathematical system for playing the game . It was a good system ; in fact , Eu had to concede it was better than his own ... most of the time . For he had noticed a flaw in the system 's logic . He had husbanded this knowledge for many months ; he knew that once he had exploited the flaw the duke would not fall into the same trap a second time . Here was the opportunity he had been waiting for . The machine 's platinum and jewels alone might fetch enough to retire his father 's debt , even at the price ( far below their actual value ) he could obtain on the black market . It would be a shame to break up such a fine creation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would attract far too much attention to the Eu family 's affairs . It was two weeks before Denali Eu was able to engineer a game of no-limit senec with the duke , and when he sat down at the table Denali 's nerves were already keening with tension . He usually kept his visits to a week , and despite his best efforts he thought some were beginning to suspect he had only two suits of clothing to his name . Denali knew the duke would not be easily trapped . As he played he extended himself much farther than he usually did , risked much more than he normally would , to engage the duke 's attention . His smile grew forced , and trickles of perspiration ran down his sides ; he had to restrain himself from nervously tapping his cards against his sweating glass of leri water . Eyebrows were raised around the table . One of the other players muttered " seems he has a touch of the old man in him after all " behind his cards . Again and again Denali raised the stakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seized control of the dealer 's token , the surest way to maintain his lead but the greatest risk in case of a forfeit . And forfeit he did , not just once but twice , for even the best system must occasionally fail in the face of an improbable run of bad cards . But through aggressive play he beat back from his losses , bankrupting one player after another . And always he kept a weather eye for the run of staves he needed to exploit the flaw in the duke 's system . Finally only Denali Eu and Duke Vey remained , the reflected light from the maroon felt of the senec table turning both their faces into demon masks . The other players watched from the surrounding darkness , most of their stakes now in Denali 's possession . He could walk away from the table right now and it would be his most profitable trip since his father 's death . " One last hand , " he said , placing his ante , " before we retire ? A hand of Dragons " Delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duke , matching the ante . Dragons " Delight was a fiendishly complicated form of senec , with round after round of betting and many opportunities for forfeit . Denali trembled beneath his cape as he raised and raised , trying to pull as much money as possible from the duke 's hand , but not so much that he would be tempted to fold . The seven of staves came out , and Denali raised his bet . The duke matched him . Then the prince of staves snapped onto the table . He raised again , substantially , and the duke raised him back . He matched , then dealt another card . It was the courtesan of staves . Their eyes met over the red-glowing table , the little pile of colorful cards , the heaps of betting counters . Denali knew the duke 's system predicted an end to the run after three staves : a win for the duke . His own system said the odds of a fourth stave at this point , yielding a win for him , were better than eighty percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bundle , tapped it against the table to square it , laid it carefully on the felt before him . He placed his hands , fingers spread , on either side of the stack for a moment . Then he reached to his left and shoved a huge pile of counters to the middle of the table . It was far more than the duke could match . The duke placed his cards flat on the table . " It seems I must fold . " " So it seems . Or ... you could wager some personal property . " " I think I know what you have in mind . " " Yes . The storytelling machine . " " I 'm sorry . That is worth far more than .... " Denali pushed all the rest of his counters forward . The duke stared levelly into Denali 's eyes . Denali stared back a challenge : How much do you trust your system ? The duke dropped his eyes to his cards . Studied them hard for a moment , then looked back . " Very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sound ran through the observers . " But I 'm afraid that must be considered a raise . What can you offer to match it ? " Denali 's heart shrank to a cold hard clinker at the center of his chest . He must match the raise , or fold . " I wager my ship . " A man in the crowd gasped audibly . Denali 's ship , the Crocus , which had been his father 's , was nothing but a worthless hull rusting behind his mother 's house . The drive and other fittings had gone to a money lender from Gaspara . If he lost , his deception would be exposed and he would be sold into slavery to pay his father 's debts . " I accept that as a match , " said the duke . Denali stared at the back of the top card of the deck . If it was a stave , he won . Else , he lost . The little boy on the card 's back design stared back at him . He could not meet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit upon one single counter that had been left by accident on the table before him , and a mad impulse seized him . He placed his index finger upon that counter , slid it across the felt to join the rest . " I raise by one . " Stunned silence from the observers . The duke 's eyes narrowed . Then widened . Then closed , as he placed his hand across them . he began to chuckle . Then he laughed out loud . He leaned back in his chair , roaring with laughter , and slapped his cards on the table before him . " You fiendish bastard ! " he gasped out . " I fold ! " Pandemonium . Denali Eu and the Duke Vey stood , shook hands , then embraced each other . The duke trembled with laughter ; Denali just trembled . Servants appeared to gather the counters and process the transfer of property . Denali could not help himself . He turned over the top card . It was the five of berries . The next morning Denali Eu came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder . He found Nerissa waiting in the entry hall , alone except for two guards . " The duke sends his regrets , " said one , " but after last night 's entertainment he finds himself indisposed to company . " Denali and the guards signed papers acknowledging the transfer of Nerissa to his possession , and he turned to leave , gesturing for her to follow . But as the door opened for them , a ray of morning sunlight touched her body and sent shimmering reflections into all the corners of the room . Denali turned back and was startled by her brilliant beauty . " You 're naked , " he blurted out , and immediately felt foolish . " Sir and Master , I am as I was made , " she replied . " I myself was born naked , but that does not excuse nudity in polite society . Here . " He removed his cape and placed it over her shoulders . It was sufficient for propriety . Then , unsure of the proper term of address for a machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the two of them walked out the door side by side . " What shall I call you ? " he said as they strolled up toward the docks . Her feet chimed on the hard pathway . " My name is Nerissa Zeebnen-Fearsig , Sir and Master . " " Yes , but have you any title ? " " No , Sir and Master . " " Your name is a trifle ... ungainly . I shall address you as M'zelle . " It was a standard term of address for a younger woman , or one of lower status . None of her other owners had ever called her anything of the sort . " As you wish , Sir and Master . " " You may address me simply as Sir , " he said . The repeated use of his full and proper title made Denali uncomfortable , for he was keenly aware of just how close he was to slavery himself . He was all the more discomfited by Nerissa 's inhuman beauty and poise . Walking beside her , he felt himself little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew that soon he would have to destroy this marvelous machine , though his mind kept trying to escape that fact . " In fact , you need not use the Sir on every statement . M'zelle . " And he inclined his head . " Yes , Sir and Ma .... Yes , Sir .... Oh , goodness . " Though her face had only a few movements to it , her confusion and embarrassment were clear from the set of her tourmaline eyebrows and amber lips . " I mean , yes . Just yes . " " Just so , " he said , and he laughed . Nerissa was unsure what to think of this man , whose clothing and bearing indicated great wealth but whose attitude toward her was deferential . She had sometimes seen fear , from unsophisticated or unlettered people , but this was something else . It was as though she held a measure of power over him . Then she realized what it was she saw in Denali Eu 's eyes . It was something she had never before seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the docks , a confusion of utilitarian buildings at the top of a hill just outside of town . This was where the shiftspace ships made landfall . " Here we are , M'zelle , " he said , and gestured her into a docking shed like all the rest . It was empty . " I do not understand , Sir . " He looked at the floor . His original plan had been to deactivate her at this point . But as they had walked together from town , he had come to understand just how heavy she was . There was no way he could smuggle her to his mother 's house unassisted , and nobody other than Nerissa herself who could be trusted to assist . He puffed out his cheeks , not raising his head . " The reason this shed is empty is that I have no ship . We will wait here until after dark , and then we will walk to my home , which is not far from here . " " You have no ship , Sir ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were warm , and hummed faintly . The fingernails were chips of ruby . He still did not meet her eyes . " No , M'zelle , I have no ship . In fact , I am afraid you are my sole possession of any value . " Finally he looked up , his eyes pleading . " I must ask that you keep my secret safe . " Nerissa 's heart went out to him then . " I am honored by your trust , Sir . " " Thank you , M'zelle . " He led her to a small office , where there was a cot and a chair and a small stasis cupboard . " This is my waiting room . Can I offer you something to drink ? Oh . " His expression of embarrassment was charming . " No , thank you , " she said . " But please ... do take a seat . " " I do not tire , Sir . " " Please , M'zelle . I insist . I could not bear to see you stand while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually . " " Very well , Sir , " she said . The chair creaked beneath her weight , but held . Denali poured himself a glass of cool water from the cupboard , then sat on the edge of the cot . " Usually I pass the time until dark reading , but since I am now the owner of a fine storytelling machine , it would seem impolite not to make use of your services . Would you please tell me a story ? " " Certainly , Sir . What kind of story would you like to hear ? " " Tell me a story about ... yourself . " A thrill went through her then . " Would you like a true story , or a made-up one ? " " True stories are always more interesting . " And so Nerissa told him a story about a golden eagle who lived for many years as the brain of a bird ship , then slept for a long time and finally became a storytelling machine . She did not embellish - the story was fantastic enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sad parts or the embarrassing parts . When she finished , it was full dark . The glass of water sat , untouched , on the dusty floor beside Denali 's cot . Unlike the tinker , Denali Eu was an educated man . He knew the history of the bird ships , and he understood just what Nerissa was and what she was capable of . He had inherited his father 's notes , his contacts , and his trading expertise along with his debts . He knew in his bones that with a bird ship he could not just repay those debts , but rebuild his family 's wealth and reputation . It was then that he made the second of the three decisions that set a legend in motion : he would find a way to refurbish the hull of Crocus and refit it as a bird ship . But all he said to Nerissa was " Thank you for the story , M'zelle . " He knew his new plan was nearly as cruel as the old , because it would still mean the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will still be alive , he told himself . You have the right to do this . She is your property . You owe it to your mother and to your father 's memory . Still he felt filthy . Denali dressed Nerissa in a spare suit of his traveling clothes , with gloves and a large floppy hat to hide her platinum skin , and they walked to his mother 's house by the light of the moons . They talked as they walked , he of his life and she of hers . Both asked questions ; both listened attentively to the answers . They learned about each other and they grew closer . If Nerissa sensed Denali was holding something back , she was not unduly concerned ; she had already received far more confidences from him than she could ever have expected . The house of Leona Eu had been hers before her marriage to Ranson Eu . It was small and patched , but warm and tasteful and genuine . Nerissa had never seen such a place ; she loved it immediately . Denali introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nerissa at gambling . Later , in private , he told his mother he planned to sell Nerissa on his next trip to Arica , but did not want the storyteller to know this because she would feel unwanted . The life of the household returned to something like its usual routine , and Nerissa did her best to contribute . She proved to be a tireless gardener ( her delicate finger joints protected from the dirt by leather gloves ) , and her ability to sit completely motionless for hours made her an impressive hunter . Nerissa was soon accepted as part of the family . This was something she had never experienced before , and she was honored and delighted . In the evenings , they all entertained each other with stories . After Leona and Nerissa had gone to bed ( for though her body never wearied , Nerissa 's brain still required sleep ) , Denali stayed up late for many nights . He researched the bird ships and hauled out the old plans of Crocus , then drew new plans . The refitted ship would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxurious , but with more lifesystem and cargo capacity . He sent both sets of plans to his father 's chandler . The reply arrived in a few days : the chandler would do the work , though he said the design seemed insane . The price he quoted was high . But the money Denali had won from the Duke would cover the down payment , and the balance was less than Nerissa 's empty body would bring on the black market . The next week the chandler came by with his delivery dirigible . He hooked chains and cables to Crocus 's corroded hull and hauled it away . Denali emptied out his secret personal cache of money and told Leona it was the proceeds of the salvage sale . " I thought we had sold every part worth salvaging long ago , " she said . " Surely the expense of the dirigible was more than the hull was worth ? " " I met the chandler on my last trip to Arica , and persuaded him he owed us a favor . " Leona still seemed unconvinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks Nerissa 's sense that Denali was hiding something from her increased . He grew haggard , and she found he would not meet her eyes . She wanted to ask him about his troubles , to repay the concern and respect she had been shown . But her years of servitude had ingrained in her a pattern of silent obedience and she said nothing . For his part , Denali felt an agony of silence . He could confide neither in his mother , who would berate him for hiring the chandler with money he did not yet have , nor in Nerissa , whose beauty he planned to tear away and sell for his own profit ; yet he ached for reassurance . He found himself uninterested in food , and spent long hours of the night staring at his ceiling , unable to sleep . On one such restless night , he watched a patch of shimmering moonlight , reflected onto his ceiling from a small pond near the house , as it passed slowly from one side of the room to the other . Suddenly , silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then returned to its previous state . Just as he was about to dismiss the phenomenon as an effect of his tired eyes , it happened again . And a third time . He rose from his bed and looked out the window . What he saw then captured his heart . It was Nerissa , dancing naked on the shore of the pond . He had seen the moonlight reflected from her shining metal body . Nerissa 's dance was a soaring , graceful thing , a poem composed of twirls and leaps and tumbles . The great strength of her legs propelled her high into the air , in defiance of her metallic weight , and brought her to landing as delicately as a faun . Her platinum skin in the moonlight shone silver on silver , black on black ; she was a creature of the moonlight , a pirouetting dancing fragment of the night . She was even more beautiful than he had thought . His heart was torn in two . Part of it wanted to fly , to leap and dance with her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his stomach , as though trying to hide from the knowledge of the plan he had laid . How could he destroy this beauty and grace for mere money ? But how could he sentence himself , his mother , and his father 's memory to a continued life of debt and deceit - a life that must eventually end in discovery and shame - for the sake of a machine ? Perhaps he let out a small sound of despair . Perhaps it was the sight of his white nightshirt in the window . For whatever reason , Nerissa noticed she was being watched . Clumsily she stopped her dance and stared directly at him , her eyes two tiny stars of reflected light . He descended the stairs and met her in the doorway . The moonlight shining from her cheek was painfully bright , and in the silence of the night he heard the tiny sounds of her eyes as they shifted in their sockets . " I 'm sorry I disturbed your sleep , Sir . " " No , no ... I was n't asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Sir . I do enjoy it . It is as close as I can come in this body to the joy of flight between the stars . " The sundered halves of Denali 's heart fused together then , for he realized then his plan for Nerissa was exactly what she wanted as well . He would restore her to her former life of sailing the currents of space , which she had described so vividly to him , and at the same time restore his own fortune . Nerissa saw the smile spreading across his face , and asked what he was thinking . " I have just thought of the most delightful surprise for you , M'zelle . A gift for you , to express my appreciation of your dance . But it will take some time to prepare , so I must ask you to be patient . " He bent and kissed the warm metal of her fingers . " Good night , M'zelle . " " Good night , Sir . " He returned to his bed and fell immediately into a deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , the refitted Crocus hanging from its gondola . The ship 's gleaming hull wore vivid stripes of red , yellow , and green , the colors of Ranson Eu 's former trading company . Denali , Leona , and Nerissa gathered together and watched as the dirigible lowered it gently to the ground . The pilot waved from the gondola as he flew away . " This is my surprise to you both , " Denali proclaimed . " Behold : Crocus is reborn ! " Nerissa stared at the ship in silent rapture , but Leona turned to her son with concern . " I suspected you were hiding something from me . This is a wonderful surprise , to be sure , but I thought we had no secrets from each other . " " Only this one , Mother . And there was a reason . Nerissa , here is my gift to you : this new Crocus has been built especially for you . In this new bird ship you will fly the stars once more . " Nerissa 's reaction confused and disturbed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes widening . " This is ... a bird ship ? " she said . " But where did you obtain the shipbrain ? " " There is no shipbrain , M'zelle . That position has been reserved for your own sweet self . " Nerissa 's metal hands bunched into fists , held tightly against her chin . She seemed to shrink into herself . " No , " she whispered . " No , no ... please , Sir and Master ... I beg you .... " Denali Eu felt his hands grow cold . " But M'zelle , when I saw you dance in the moonlight ... I thought to fly the stars was your greatest joy . " " To fly is joy , yes ... but to be cut from this body ... to be severed ... uprooted ... the pain , Sir and Master ... that pain is something I could never endure again . " She crouched , trembling , on the stones of the path . Her eyes were huge . " I would rather die , Sir and Master . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir and Master , please ... I know you are my owner , I know I must obey your wishes without question or hesitation , but I beg you ... do not ask me to do this . " And she fell at his feet , her hands raised as though to ward off a blow . All the color ran out of Denali Eu 's world . He turned from Nerissa and Leona and marched clumsily into the woods behind the house . They did not follow . Some time later he found himself seated on a fallen log . The sun was low in the sky and his clothes and skin were torn from thorns and brambles . How could he have been so stupid ? He had lied to his mother , lied to Nerissa , made unwarranted assumptions , and promised money he did not have . Soon the chandler 's bill would arrive and he had nothing with which to pay it . He considered his options . He could follow through with his plan - and Nerissa would find some way to end her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if he were heartless enough to force her to do this , he did not relish the idea of trusting his life to a ship he had betrayed . He could break up Nerissa , sell her platinum and precious stones to pay the chandler - and she would be gone completely , and he would have only a worthless hull without a drive . He could sell Nerissa in one piece - and it would be the same , only with more money . Nerissa would still be lost to him , and subject to the whim of some other master who might treat her still more cruelly . He could repudiate the chandler 's bill , declare bankruptcy - and see Nerissa sold off , along with his mother 's house , and himself sold into slavery . But there was one more option . Denali Eu was an educated man , and he knew the history of the bird ships . He also knew Nerissa 's story . And because of this knowledge , and despite this knowledge , he made the final , fateful decision that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time sitting on the log , his head in his hands , but he could think of no other alternative . Then he stood and walked back to his mother 's house . There , as the sun set , he told Nerissa and Leona of his decision . His mother cried and shouted and beat her hands upon the kitchen table ; Nerissa sat upon a chair with her head bowed , but did not speak . Neither of them could change his mind . The next day Nerissa and Leona took Denali Eu for a walk in the forest . He listened to the birds and the rustling of the leaves , and he felt the cool wind brush gently against his skin . He smelled the green of the leaves and the damp of the earth , and as many flowers as they could find . In the evening they prepared for him a fine meal , with pungent spices and fresh vegetables , and succulent fruits new-gathered and sweet . Nerissa massaged his back with her strong warm fingers , and his mother cried as she brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following morning he went into the city and gave himself to the doctors . He told them what he wanted , and he swore three times that this was his will . And so they killed him , and they took his brain and welded it to the keel of the Crocus . For the techniques of Doctor Jay were legal , as long as the donation was voluntary and sworn to three times , and the organs of a young man in the best of health could be sold for enough money to pacify the chandler . The operation was every bit as painful as Nerissa had said . But Denali found sailing the stars was even more delightful than dancing in the moonlight : a symphony of colors and textures beyond his human experience . And this ship was equipped with eyes and ears and hands within its hull as well as without . The ship , renamed the Golden Eagle , became a hugely successful trader . Denali Eu 's knowledge and skill , combined with Nerissa Zeebnen-Fearsig 's beauty and charm , were something no seller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ship with a human mind and a metal captain was famed in song and story , and when after many years Leona Eu died she left one of the greatest fortunes in the Consensus . Denali Eu and Nerissa the Silver Captain have not been seen for many , many years . Some say they sought new challenges in the Magellanic Clouds or even beyond . Some say they settled down to a contented existence on an obscure planet . But no one doubts that , wherever they are , they are together still . <p>
