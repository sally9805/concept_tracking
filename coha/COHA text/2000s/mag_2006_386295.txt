Showbiz is n't just a dirty business . Catholics should give two thumbs up even to some of Hollywood 's provocative creations and choose to learn from rather than criticize them . // I HAVE WORKED IN AND AROUND HOLLYWOOD FOR SEVERAL years . Besides teaching media literacy in the faith community , I screen films ; attend press junkets ; hear directors , writers , and actors speak about their craft ; and review at least six movies a month . I have discovered some fine aspects of the entertainment industry as well as some weak elements , too . Contrary to what some people think , I believe Catholics need to build bridges with Hollywood rather than gripe about it . Instead of simply boycotting objectionable films and television shows , those of us in the faith community need to thank the industry when they do well , educate ourselves about the media as storytellers and businesses , critically discuss and question the stories they give us , and use appropriate media in creative , thoughtful ways for faith formation . In short , we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood . Whether we recognize it or not , Hollywood can and does make movies that matter . Recent films prove this : Mad hot Ballroom documents the power of the arts to teach children about life ; The Chronicles of Narnia captures C. S. Lewis ' imaginative adaptation of the Paschal Mystery in film ; and The Constant Gardener challenges us to integrate Catholic social teaching into the process of globalization . I love how a film like Crash exhibits the quality of a great novel and that a film like hotel Rwanda makes me uncomfortable with stories of human suffering . TV shows like CBS ' now-cancelled Joan of Arcadia , about a teenage girl who has conversations with God , and TV movies with transcendent themes such as HBO 's Wit , TNT 's Door to Door , and ABC 's Tuesdays with Morrie also inspire me . TRUE , HOLLYWOOD CAN AND DOES MAKE MOVIES AND TV shows that dismiss human dignity and exploit the body . It makes movies that show vengeance as a virtue . Hollywood is first and foremost a business , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one good thing about bad movies is that they often fizzle . But instead of blaming the media for everything , we in the audience need to take some responsibility , engage our faith , and not be afraid that we will wilt in a culture that promotes virtue while challenging it at the same time . As a film critic and media literacy educator , I am bothered when audiences miss the point of a movie because of a bad word . In one scene in the wonderful film Simon Birch , the 12-year-old Christ-figure , Simon , yells at his fellow Sunday school students , " Put me down , you assholes ! " I showed this clip at a catechetical workshop for adults but failed to warn them of the language . Even though the power of the scene was far stronger than the shock of a kid saying a bad word , a couple of ladies were furious that a nun would show it . It 's also maddening when audiences miss the point of a movie because of a low-cut blouse . Erin Brockovich shows its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no support system , and a history of poor choices . She 's also portrayed as a Good Shepherd figure who works for the oppressed and was willing to lay down her life for her " sheep . " But too many people wrote her-and the movie-off simply because of the way she dressed . SO DO N'T JUST COMPLAIN OR TURN OFF THE SET . PEOPLE of faith and goodwill create community and a culture of civility when they respectfully share insights , differing opinions , and values about the stories they experience on the big-or small-screen . Everyone can choose carefully which films to watch and everyone can critique a film ; everyone can work out what the filmmaker was trying to say by talking about it with other people . One mother told me that when her 15-year-old daughter asked to see R-rated films , she responded , " First , you have to ask each time , and second , when you come home you have to tell me how you saw-or did n't see-God 's presence in that movie . " They realized , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean immoral ; it means the story is for people old enough to understand the complexities of human behavior and the consequences of choices . Several years later the daughter still calls her mom to talk about the movies she 's seen . Movies serve them well as a moral and spiritual laboratory . That opportunity is lost when parents turn off a recommended TV show or DVD because a single scene makes them nervous . One mother was very upset with me for recommending the film Millions . She said that there was a " pornographic " scene in it when a boy lands on a website that showed a woman in a bra . His little brother comes in and asks , " What are those breasts for ? " " To feed babies , " the older brother responds . True , the older brother was probably looking for trouble , but the scene was luminous as the younger brother realized how much his recently deceased mother must have loved him to feed him with her body . It was a teachable moment about the beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned it off as soon as the computer screen appeared . All that kids learn in situations like this is what their mother does n't like . They do n't get a chance to learn why . It 's crucial to remember that the future storytellers are in our pews , living rooms , and classrooms today . How shall we prepare them to be relevant and faithful media consumers and media makers ? Engaging the media is not just for parents . What I most dislike is when people react intensely to something they have n't seen or when they call something anti-Catholic or anti-religious before they have seen it . Take The Da Vinci Code , for instance . Fifty million copies of the novel are in print , and just before the movie opened , there was a movement afoot to boycott it . So what do we say to people who ask us what Catholics believe , who want to engage us about the book and movie on the level of our faith ? Do we say , " Oh , I wo n't see it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Word of God and the Nicene Creed for people who seek truth from us ? A negative reaction to a film does not constitute faith-sharing . A shared experience can bring forth a faith-filled conversation about issues the film addresses and plant seeds of the gospel . WE HAVE SOME WONDERFUL CHURCH TEACHINGS IN DOCUments like the 1992 pastoral instruction Dawn of a New Era , which mandated that each diocese has a pastoral plan for communications , including media literacy or mindfulness programs that teach people how to choose media wisely and critically engage with it . Pope John Paul II 's final document , The Rapid Development , and Pope Benedict XVI 's first message for World Communication Day , The Media : A Network for Communication , Communion , and Cooperation , describe the media as gifts of God and ask for our faithful , creative , and critical engagement with them . This body of church teachings encourages us to get out there and do something with the media rather than wail about being victimized . These documents do not ask that we boycott the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the critical use of the media . The new National Directory for Catechesis from the U.S. bishops says , " Especially in the U.S. , " the very evangelization of modern culture depends to a great extent on the influence of the media . ' In fact , the mass media are so influential that they have a culture all their own , which has its own language , customs , and values . Heralds of the gospel must enter the world of the mass media , learn as much as possible about that culture , evangelize that culture , and determine how best to employ the media to serve the Christian message . " TRUE ART PORTRAYS ALL ASPECTS OF OUR HUMAN REALITY , including sin , and as the artist Georgia O'Keefe once said , " True art irritates . " Some protagonists will triumph , some will struggle and fail , and some wo n't even try . Sounds like some people I know-and some of the folks Jesus hung out with as well . We in the faith community are compelled first to understand and articulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV shows that are products of our culture . Only then can we address the sensitive issues being portrayed and challenge the material that conflicts with our beliefs , our morality , and our faiths teachings . Only then can we offer relevant , alternative attitudes and actions . We ca n't just not watch and hoard our faith . That 's not the answer .
