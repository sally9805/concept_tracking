Washington , D.C. Finn Callahan hated bad guys , criminal lawyers , bureaucrats and cockroaches . At least the bad guys had provided him with a livelihood as an FBI Special Agent for the past thirteen years . Why the good Lord had created the other three remained one of those universal mysteries , like how the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids or why it always rained right after you washed your truck . " It 's not like I killed the guy , " he muttered . The way Finn saw it , a broken nose , some bruises and a few broken ribs did n't begin to equal the crimes that scumbag serial killer had committed . " Only because two agents , a Maryland state trooper and a court-appointed shrink managed to pull you off him before you could , " the woman behind the wide desk said . There was enough ice in her tone to coat Jupiter . Her black suit was unadorned ; her champagne blond hair , cut nearly as short as his , barely reached the collar , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dress blues and she could have appeared on a U.S. Marine recruiting poster . " I 've spent the past hour on the phone with Lawson 's lead attorney . Unsurprisingly , he wants to file assault and battery charges . And that 's just for starters . I 'm attempting to convince him to allow us to handle the matter internally . " Unpolished fingernails , trimmed short as a nun 's , tapped an irritated tattoo on the gleaming desktop . Finn had no problem with women in the Bureau ; he 'd worked with several and would have trusted his life to them any day . Hell , even James Bond had gotten a woman boss when Judi Dench took over as M. Finn did n't even have any problem with ice queens like Special Agent in Charge Lillian Jansen . He did , however , have a Herculean problem with any SAC who was n't a stand-up guy . From the day she 'd arrived from the New York field office , Jansen had proven herself to be far more interested in the politics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a helluva thing when an SAC takes the side of a sicko killer over one of her own men , " he muttered . " Christ , Callahan , " the other man in the office warned . James Burke 's ruddy cheeks were the hue of ripe cherries , suggesting that Finn 's recent behavior had n't been good for his blood pressure problem . A faint white ring around his mouth was evidence he 'd been chugging Maalox directly from the bottle again . " You 're out of line , Special Agent , " Jansen snapped . " Again . " Leaning back in the leather swivel chair , she dropped the sword that had been hanging over his head for the past forty-eight hours  --  ever since the killer it had taken Finn nearly three years to track through eight states had made the mistake of trying to escape from the hospital , just as Finn dropped by to see how the court-appointed psychiatric evaluation was going . " I will , of course , have no choice but to turn this incident over to OPR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a police force 's internal affairs bureau . Since many of its investigators possessed a **28;718;TOOLONG attitude , a lot of agents tended to distrust the OPR right back . The idea of being thrown to the wolves made Finn 's gut churn , but unwilling to allow Jansen to know she 'd gotten beneath his skin , he forced his shoulders to relax , schooled his expression to a mask , and although it was n't easy , kept his mouth shut . " You 're scheduled to be questioned tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock . You are , of course , entitled to be represented by legal counsel . " " Now there 's an idea . Maybe I can get one of those worms making up Lawson 's legal dream team to represent me . Of course , the only problem with that idea is since Lawson 's a gazillionaire sicko with bucks out the kazoo , I doubt any of those scumbags would want to take on the case of a middle income cop who got pissed off at their client for raping and killing coeds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country from California to Maryland . Finn 's recurring nightmare was that there were still more missing women he had n't yet discovered who could be linked to the guy . " We would have had eleven victims if Callahan had n't gotten to Lawson 's house when he did and found those girls locked up in his basement . " A chain-smoker , Burke 's voice was as rough as a bad gravel road . " That 's part of my problem . " Frustration sharpened the SAC 's brisk voice . " The Georgetown girl 's parents are close personal friends of the Attorney General . In fact , the AG and his wife are her godparents . They heard about Lawson 's attempted escape on the nightly news and are pressuring the AG to allow Callahan 's outrageous cowboy tactics to slide . " Finn shot a sideways look at Burke , whose expression told him they were thinking the same thing . That perhaps he just should have put his gun barrel into the guy 's mouth and pulled the trigger in those midnight hours when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop in the place would have sworn on a stack of bibles that deadly force had been absolutely justified . He 'd always been a by-the-book kind of guy , the type of FBI agent Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . had played on TV , but sometimes the laws protecting the bad guys really sucked . " How about we come up with a compromise ? " Burke suggested . " What type of compromise do you have in mind ? " Jansen asked . " Callahan takes a leave of absence until this blows over . Say , two weeks . " " That 's not enough time for damage control . Four weeks suspension , " she countered . " Without pay . " Finn had been staring up at the ceiling , pretending disinterest in the negotiation . When he realized Burke was n't countering Jansen 's proposal , he shot the SAC a savage look . " Fuck that . " He rubbed knuckles which had been bruised when they 'd connected so satisfyingly with Lawson 's jaw . You are not , he instructed his itchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole through that damn trophy wall . A wall covered with photographs of SAC Lillian Jansen with seemingly every politician in town . " I 'll take my chances with OPR . " " Dammit , Finn , it 's not that bad an offer . " Burke plowed a hand through thinning hair the color of a rusty Brillo pad . " You have n't taken a real vacation in years . Go home , do some fishing , unwind , and when you come back all this shit will have blown over . " They both knew it 'd probably take another Hurricane Andrew to blow this particular shit pile away . " If I were you , I 'd take your squad supervisor 's advice . " Jansen folded her arms across the front of a jacket as black as her heart . Finn suspected that not only was she enjoying this , she was just waiting for him to squirm . Not in this lifetime , his expression said . Want to bet ? hers said right back . " If this goes any further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd do it if it 'd help her career . Hell , she 'd probably run over her own dog if it 'd get her a promotion to ADIC . Of course she did n't actually have a dog ; that would take some kind of personal commitment  --  and from what he 'd seen , the woman was only committed to her swift climb up the Bureau 's political ladder . " Two weeks . " Forget Hurricane Andrew . Finn needed a tornado to come sweeping out of Kansas , swoop down over K Street , and drop a damn house on Lillian Jansen . " Four . " Her lips actually quirked a bit at the corners , hinting at the closest thing to a smile he 'd witnessed since her heralded arrival from New York . She held out her hand , palm up . " And I 'll take your weapon and shield . " Feeling Burke 's gaze on him , the silent plea to make nice radiating off his squad commander like a physical presence , Finn swallowed the frustration that rose like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder holster and resisted , just barely , the urge to throw it onto her desk . When he failed to manage the same restraint with his shield , all three pairs of eyes watched the leather case slide off the highly polished surface onto the carpet . Finn hoped Jansen would ask him to pick it up , so he could suggest where she could plant those thin , pale lips . " Do you know the trouble with you , Callahan ? " " No . But I have a feeling you 're going to tell me . " " You 've begun to believe your own press . There are those in the Bureau , including your former SAC , who may be impressed by your appearances on Nightline and your dinners at the White House . But as far as I 'm concerned , you have a very bad attitude toward authority . You also take your work personally . " " And your point is ? " She glared at him with nearly as much contempt as he felt for her , then pressed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escort Special Agent Callahan out of the building . " " I 'll do that , " Burke offered quickly . It was obvious he wanted to get Finn out of the office before things got worse . " It 's not your job , " Jansen said . " A superior stands by his men . " His tone clearly implied the SAC did not . If Jansen 's eyes were frost , Burke 's were flame . Finn was willing to take the heat himself , but did n't want to cause a longtime friend any more problems . Especially since he knew Burke had put a second mortgage on his Arlington house to pay for his three kids ' college tuition and could n't afford a disciplinary suspension . " Jim , it 's okay . " " The hell it is , " the older man shot back . " This whole mess stinks to high heaven . " He pinned the SAC with a hard look . Clearly unwounded , she merely shrugged in return . " You have ten minutes , " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had just opened the office door when she called his name . Glancing back over his shoulder , he imagined a black widow spider sitting in the center of her web . " If I were you Callahan , I 'd spend the next month sending out resumes . Because if and when you return , you 'll be transferred to another field office , where  --  if I have anything to say about it , and believe me , I do  --  you 'll be reassigned to desk duty . " Oh , she was good . Coldly efficient , deadly accurate , hitting right on target . She knew he 'd rather be gut shot than spend the rest of his career stuck in some dreary outpost , shuffling papers . Finn would bet his last grade increase that , instead of playing Barbie dolls and having pretend tea parties like other little girls , SAC Jansen had spent her childhood drowning kittens . He heard Burke clear his throat , another less-than-subtle warning . But Finn refused to justify her threat with a response . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any hobbies , nor had he bothered to accumulate any superfluous stuff that might clutter up either his desk or his life . He cleaned a few personal effects from his desk and was out of the building in just under eight minutes .
