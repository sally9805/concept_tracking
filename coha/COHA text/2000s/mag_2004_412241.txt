Black market rockets and missiles are killing American soldiers . Here is how we 'll fight back . // In the weeks before the invasion of Iraq , a rare public fight developed between the Army 's top general and his civilian boss . At issue was the number of troops the United States would need to oust Saddam Hussein , Gen. Eric K. Shinseki told the Senate Armed Services Committee the job would take " something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers . " Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld believed it could be done with about half that number . Missing from the sound bites that framed the debate was the reason behind the discrepancy . Acting upon what it believed to be sound intelli-gence , the Department of Defense ( DOD ) expected entire Iraqi divisions to lay down their arms . Shinseki looked beyond that surrender and worried that without a sufficient force to stand guard , the Iraqi arsenal would be plundered . Both men proved correct . The U.S. took military control of Iraq with about 130,000 , mostly American , troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pulled off its pedestal , a massive stockpile of rocket-propelled grenade launchers and shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles had fallen into the hands of Islamic insurgents . In the months that followed , half the Americans who died in Iraq were killed by one type of these weapons , the RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade . RPG-7 " The RPG-7 is everywhere , " George J. Mordica II , a senior analyst for the Center for Army Lessons Learned , tells POPULAR MECHANICS . " We have people embedded in Iraq . In every patrol in which they recover weapons , they find RPG-7s . " Cheap to buy , easy to use and nearly as rugged as a club , the RPG-7 is an old weapon that has been reborn in the hands of militants . Originally developed by the Bazalt State Research and Production Enterprise in Russia in the 1960s , its simplicity made it an immediate favorite among armies in Soviet bloc countries , China and North Korea . By the end of the Cold War , RPG-7s had found their way into the inventories of 40 armies , many in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are loose in trouble spots around the world is unknown . Even the number in legitimate hands is uncertain . Mordica and other weapons analysts tell PM that at least 1 million RPG-7s have been manufactured by Bazalt or are under license . What is known is that since the fall of the Soviet Union , the flow of RPG-7s from military warehouses to the black market has grown from a trickle to a flood . RPG-7s are now so plentiful , they can be bought for less than the price of a decent laptop computer . In the age of night vision goggles and satellite-guided smart bombs , the wooden stock and rough handgrip of the RPG-7 make it seem only a slight technological advance over the bow and arrow . Mordica says the weapon traces its origin to the Panzerfaust tank buster that Germany developed for territorial defense toward the end of World War II . And that weapon , say military historians , was itself based on confiscated bazookas that had been used by the Allies . The single-round RPG-7 that has proved so deadly to American forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the shooter holds the tube with two handgrips , takes aim through the simple optical sight and pulls the trigger . Depending upon the type of ammunition fired , a single RPG-7 round can shred a squad in a clearing , stop a tank from three football fields away or bring down a helicopter . " Close combat is a directfire brawl in which the RPG-7 excels , " Lester W. Grau , an analyst who studies tactics for the Department of Defense Foreign Military Studies Office at Fort Leavenworth , Kan. , tells PM . This was a lesson that both the local mujahedeen and Soviet army quickly learned during their 1979 to 1989 war in Afghanistan . At the beginning of that conflict , the Soviet army typically assigned one RPG-7 to a motorized rifle squad . As soldiers gained experience in fighting in the mountainous terrain , they saw the advantage of adding more RPG-7s . The mujahedeen found the weapon even more valuable , adopting tactics that included forming armor-vehicle hunterkiller teams . " Fifty to 80 percent of the personnel were armed with RPG-7s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grau . " When there were n't mortars available , m these groups used their RPG-7s as a form of pseudo artillery . " Although it was never intended for use against aircraft , the RPG-7 became an effective helicopter killer . In October 1994 , two U.S. Army Black Hawks fighting in Mogadishu , Somalia , were shot down by RPG-7 fire . In Afghanistan , the mujahedeen used the weapons for helicopter ambushes . It has been used in a similar fashion by insurgents in Iraq ( see " Insurgent RPG-7 Tactics " on the preceding page ) . New Warheads Part of the reason for the continuing success of the RPG-7 is Bazalt 's eagerness to introduce new types of ammunition for its venerable weapon . " The new TBG-7V , PG-7VR and OG-7V rounds allow a soldier to accomplish an unprecedented range of missions on the battlefield , " Anatoly Obukhov , Director General of the Bazalt State Research and Production Enterprise , told the Russian military journal Military Parade . The thermobaric TBG-7V round has a lethality comparable to a 120mm artillery projectile or mortar shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle . The warhead explosion creates a high-temperature field and simultaneously generates a powerful blast wave , " Obukhov explained . When fired against unprotected troops , it shreds and incinerates everyone within a 30-ft. radius of where it detonates . If it strikes armor , it produces a 6- to 18-in. opening . The heat and shock wave from the explosion then enters the vehicle , killing the crew . One way to defend against this type of round is to apron a tank with reactive armor , which is essentially a coating of explosive . When the round strikes the tank , the reactive armor explodes-in effect , it pushes back against the incoming round . This prevents the focused jet of molten metal created by the impact of the shaped charge from squirting through the crew compartment . The PG-7VR overcornes reactive armor by using a 2-part , or tandem , warhead . It hits the tank with two closely timed blasts . The first punches a hole in the reactive armor . The second attacks the armor . The OG-7V fragmentation round is designed specifically for urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in brick and reinforced concrete , " says Obukhov . This necessitates dropping the RPG-7 round through a relatively small opening through which the entrenched defender is firing . " The OG-7V accuracy is very close to that of small arms . " The Iraqi army is generally believed to have all three of these advanced RPG-7 rounds , along with older varieties of antipersonnel and anti-armor munitions . " The RPG-7 will be around for a good while yet , " predicts the DOD 's Grau . " It is a proven , cheap killer of tanks and helicopters , which will continue to play a significant role , particularly when conventional forces are pitted against irregular forces . " Missile Attacks With an estimated 1 million rocket-propelled grenade launchers in use in 40 countries , the RPG-7 is the most common threat facing American troops . It is not , however , the sole threat . Hussein 's looted arsenal was also brimming with SA-7 Grail anti-aircraft missiles . According to the Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) , over the past 25 years the Grail and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been responsible for attacks on 35 airliners-mostly commercial flights . Twenty-four of these attacks led to crashes , killing more than 500 . In Iraq , as many as 5000 Grails are believed to have fallen into the hands of insurgents . CRS reports that between May and November 2003 , 19 attacks on aircraft took place in the vicinity of Baghdad International Airport . The chief limitation of the RPG-7 is that it relies upon the aim of the shooter . In contrast , the SA-7 can find its own targets . Each missile is equipped with an infrared sensor that " sees " the invisible heat trail behind a jet engine as though it were a beacon atop a lighthouse . Guidance-system circuitry reacts to changing input from the sensor by adjusting the fins of the missile . This keeps the Grail pointed toward its target as it streaks through the sky at supersonic speeds . When the missile reaches the engine , its warhead detonates 2.5 pounds of high explosives . Despite the heavy toll Grails have taken on aircraft and the lives that have been lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose a lesser threat in the future . The first has to do with the age of the weapons . The Grail tracks its quarry with an infrared sensor and heat-activated batteries to power its circuitry . All have a limited shelf life . Although estimates vary , many of the Grails in illegitimate hands are believed to be too old to reliably fire . The second shortcoming has to do with the way the Grail finds its targets . The Grail is a tailchaser , which means that it must be fired from behind an aircraft in order to gain sight of the heat from the plane 's engines . The distance between shooter and target-as far as 6 miles-gives the aircraft crew time to defend itself . One technique is to release flares , creating a target that 's " brighter " than the heat from the jet engine . Air Force One , commercial airliners operated by Israel 's El Al and military aircraft have installed various types of these systems . Efforts are under way to install similar defensive systems on American airliners . Best Defense At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurgents ' rocket and missile attacks is called FCLAS . The abbreviated acronym stands for " full spectrum active protection close-in layered shield , " which in itself is an explanation of how it works . FCLAS is an antimissile missile in a tube . Strategically placed around a vehicle , boat , building or helicopter , these missiles create a sort of invisible shield that detects and then demolishes incoming threats . The idea behind FCLAS is simple in concept but difficult in execution . The forward section of the FCLAS projectile houses two radar systems . The radar at the front looks forward for objects whose speed is consistent with an RPG-7 round or missile . When this threat is detected , a black powder charge , like that used to launch smoke grenades , ignites , propelling the FCLAS out of its storage tube . The second radar system looks up , down and to both sides . The launch of the FCLAS projectile is timed so that it and the incoming target will pass each other when they are about 15 ft. from the vehicle being protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passing threat and ignites the explosive material that fills the middle of the projectile . The force fractures the explosive 's metal sheath . Scored lines in the sheathing cause it to shatter into tiny square-shaped shards that radiate outward . Anything in the path of this doughnut-shaped wall of fast-moving metal is shredded into confetti . Collateral Damage A chilly wind heavy with the scent of snow is blowing across the test range at Camp W.G. Williams near Salt Lake City , Utah . PM has been invited to observe the first in a series of live-fire fragmentation tests . Because FCLAS is used close to the vehicles and people it is intended to protect , it is critical to know just how far the destructive " doughnut " created when an FCLAS explodes will extend . The Army has already seen a convincing demonstration of the projectile 's ability to detect and knock down incoming threats . That test was conducted in June 2002 at the New Mexico Institute of Technology . Killing an RPG-7 round requires considerable energy . " That 's nasty stuff . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walton of California-based Chang Industries , which developed the FCLAS radar systems . The open question is how much collateral damage is caused in the immediate vicinity of the detonation . A junked car , battered SUV , and dummies in flak jackets to simulate drivers and bystanders are set up around the test site , shown in the high-speed photo above . Inside a trailer protected from the explosion by a natural ridge , there is a brief countdown before detonation . The air cracks and the floor jumps as if a lightning bolt has struck nearby . Through the window , we watch a plume of gray and black smoke form over the ridge and drift from the blast . After the blast , the dummies are still standing . Both vehicles have had their windows blown out . Several tires have been punctured . It is a far cry from the damage inflicted by an RPG-7 round or SA-7 warhead that hits home . Maury Mayfield , President of Virginia-based Archangel Defense Systems , which is working on FCLAS with Chang and U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research Development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is standing at the detonation point . Almost everything looks as it did before the blast . The sole difference is a series of depressions in the sandy ground , as if someone used their heel to scrape a line of evenly spaced furrows . Mayfield makes a circling motion with his hand . He traces the doughnut-shaped region that , for less than a hundredth of a second , was filled with metal fragments moving at supersonic speed . " Nothing would leak through that , " he says . Had an actual missile been fired toward the FCLAS projectile , it would have dissolved into a tongue of flame as the explosives in its warhead were pulverized and burned away . In Michigan , news of the test has been received enthusiastically by TARDEC Research Director Grace M. Bochenek . " We are in the process of working with program managers for the Bradley , Stryker , Humvee , and future tactical truck programs , " she says , naming the vehicles for which FCLAS protective modules are being considered . " We hope to have a prototype system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready in two years . " Sidebar DEFENSE " When there were n't mortars available , these groups used their RPG-7s as a form ofpseudo artillery .
