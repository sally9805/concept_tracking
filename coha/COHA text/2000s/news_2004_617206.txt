<p> Clarkesville  --  Kevin Carstens was kneeling on his living room floor and leaning over the coffee table , sketching out what happened on that cold January day . As he sketched , he talked about what he felt like as he thought that this day would be his last on Earth . At 47 , with a wife and two grown children , he would die in the woods just 300 yards from his Habersham County home . <p> The kitchen door opened , and a couple walked in . Carstens turned his head slowly and saw 22-year-old Deborah Williams . <p> " That is my angel , " he said , looking at Williams . Williams was on 911 dispatch duty that day . <p> Jan. 4 , 2004 <p> Approximately 3:40 p.m . From the 911 tapes . The conversation between Carstens and Williams . <p> " Kevin , we are getting an ambulance on the way to you . I am going to keep talking to you . To make sure you 're OK . " <p> ( He has a hook in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , she does not know what kind of hook . It could have been , she thought , a fish hook . ) . <p> " Kevin , talk to me . What happened , Kevin ? Talk to me , Kevin . " <p> " It was a hook . I had chopped down a tree . " He pauses . <p> " OK , you chopped down a tree . . . " <p> He tells her it was a tow hook  --  the kind you use to tow cars . <p> She relays to the crew what she knows of what happened to Kevin Carstens . The tow hook is in his neck . She now has a mental picture of the situation . <p> " Kevin , I am going to keep you on the line in case anything happens . How are you feeling right now ? " she asks . <p> " Uh , I 'm just scared . Just scared , " he answers . <p> " Just scared ? You are not feeling weak or anything ? " <p> " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I can put my fingers in it , " he answers . <p> " OK . Do n't mess with it , OK ? Can you take your shirt off without having to pull it over your head ? " <p> " No , uh , " he said . <p> " Do you have anything around you to put on it , to apply pressure . Any kind of cloth ? " <p> " I , I got my gloves and . . . on it . " <p> " It 's OK . Do n't move it . Even if it bleeds through . Do not move it . Try to stay calm and slow your breathing , OK ? <p> " Oh , my God . Thank God I had a knife in my pocket . I would n't have made it . " <p> " It 's a good thing you did have a knife in your pocket . " ( She is just talking because it 's not clear what the knife was for . ) <p> Carstens begins to tell again what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead tree went down , he got pinned to another tree with a tow hook in his neck . He managed to cut the rope near the hook . She encourages him to keep talking but to lie still . She asks him how old he is . He tells her he 's 47 . <p> " Kevin , it 's OK to be scared . You have a reason to be scared . " <p> She gives directions to the EMS crew en route . Someone asks Williams if she knows any of his medical history . She goes over the directions again . He hears her and gives directions to his house . He tells them to follow the tire tracks from his house to the cemetery . <p> " We have units on the way to you . They do know where you are . They are familiar with the area . Just keep taking deep breaths for me and stay calm . " <p> " I ca n't believe it . I 'm not doing too good . " <p> " Kevin , if you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even if you pass out , I am going to stay on the phone . I will be on the phone . I will be here , Kevin . OK ? " <p> Six weeks later . <p> Carstens tells his story . He sits beside Williams . Most of the time , she stares straight ahead . Her husband , Jason , is with the Habersham Sheriff 's Department . He knows what his wife went through . He too has worked 911 dispatch . Carstens ' wife sits several feet away . Dusty , the family 's yellow Lab , barks outside . The black cats , Tiger and Ning , wander around the house . It 's foggy and misting as Carstens tells his story . <p> Taking down a tree is something he has done before . Carstens installs cabinets for the Cabinet Place , and he was been around wood all his life . The Carstens burn a lot of wood in their mountain home , which is about seven miles north of Clarkesville . He knew of a large dead tree near his property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominantly by African-Americans for many years , perhaps centuries . <p> He wanted to make sure the tree did not fall on any headstones . He had 150 feet of rope . <p> He secured ropes around the dead tree and ran them through two pine trees  --  which stood very close together  --  quite a few yards away from the dead tree . At the two pines , he secured his guide ropes with a 10-foot tow rope . The tow rope had a large hook at each end . <p> He felled the tree . The guide ropes worked . But Carstens had no idea how much tension was on the ropes . From where he was standing , it looked unlikely that much tension was on the rope . <p> He walked up to the pine and lifted a hook off the guide rope and turned to walk away . He heard a noise . He did n't know what it was . He knows now . <p> The tension was so great that the guide rope and tow rope began whipping around the tree rapidly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt an impact on his left shoulder . He was spun around and pulled toward the pines . He was pinned . <p> The tension was too great . He tried to pull the rope toward him . He could not . He then realized he was bleeding . He could not see his neck but had a good idea what was causing the bleeding . <p> ' No pain ' <p> A hook was in his neck . <p> " I was . . . panicked , " he said . " I thought it was over with . " <p> Oddly , he said he felt " nothing . No pain . None . " <p> He looks at a picture of himself in the ER . The brutally graphic photo is a shot from the chest up . The hook is visible . It entered the front of his neck and exited on the right side . <p> " I could n't move . I could n't do anything . I felt like I did n't even have time to reach for my phone if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panic lasted about 30 seconds . He had difficulty breathing . He had already given up on freeing himself by pulling on the rope . <p> He pauses a moment . Then Carstens tells very matter-of-factly about the light . There is no emotion in his voice . He said he did n't think of himself as particularly religious that day . <p> " That 's when a light . . . . I would say a star . It appeared . Right in front of me , and flared back toward my face , " he said . <p> " I do n't know what it was . But I calmed down . It was like I could think , " he said . <p> He remembered he had a pocketknife . He took as deep a breath as he could and " began cutting like mad . " When he finally sliced through , the loose rope shot away from him and landed 50 feet away . <p> He pulled away from the tree , turned around and slowly sank down and rested his back against the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , but he knew the hook was in him and he knew he had a gaping hole . <p> " Anywhere I put my hand , it went in a hole in my neck . I knew the hook was there , but I did n't know how . I felt numb . If I had known where and how , I might have tried to pull it out . " <p> He said he did n't want his wife to see him , yet he wanted her there " so badly . " <p> " I called her and told her to call 911 . She said , ' For you ? ' And I said , ' Yes . ' I thought she may have trouble getting through . " <p> He remembered his cellphone . He took it out . He dialed 911 and reached his angel . <p> Williams and Carstens had never met before this week . Although she is only 22 , she has had two years on the job . She knows the stress . She has handled calls where " the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we began , I had no idea how bad it was . When he said hook , I thought fish hook or something . So I started asking basic questions . When I asked him what happened and how it happened , he told me it was a tow hook . He said it was like the kind you tow a car out of a ditch with . That 's when I knew how big it was . How serious . " <p> She saw the picture for the first time last week . " I could n't believe it . I talked to this man ! " <p> She said she thought only of keeping Carstens on the line . Keeping him talking . Trying to calm him . <p> " We 've had classes that teach us things to do , things we can say . And some things are just instinctive , " Williams said . <p> ' He seemed very calm ' <p> She said one factor was that Carstens was relatively calm . <p> " I have had people who were a lot less calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that way , he seemed very calm . " <p> His wife , Sharon , was torn . She wanted to go to him , but she was afraid the ambulance might not find him . She decided to wait and lead them to the area . <p> " By then I really wanted her there , " Carstens said . " I do n't know how much blood I had lost . I did n't know how much longer I had . " <p> Carstens estimates it took the ambulance about 10 minutes to reach him after he called . <p> The emergency medic knelt beside him and " basically pried my fingers off my neck . When I saw their face , I knew it was bad . " <p> Airlifted to Atlanta <p> Carstens ' fear was reinforced when he heard they were going to call for a helicopter . He turned to look at his wife . He asked her how bad it was . <p> " I just told him that he had done a good job , " Sharon said . <p> The ambulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting . Still , he said , he felt no pain , and he continued talking and trying to " joke a little bit . I was n't going to close my eyes . " <p> The flight took him to Atlanta Medical Center and straight into the emergency room . <p> Dr. Vernon J. Henderson , chief trauma surgeon at the center , was on duty . <p> " When we first saw him , we were very , very concerned . That hook was so close to the carotid artery . I could see it was hooked around a major muscle in his neck . This was very serious , " Henderson said . <p> Henderson said the emergency crew knew not to try to dislodge the hook because a slightly wrong move could have cause Carstens to bleed to death quickly . <p> " The reality is , he is a very lucky man . This was very serious . Very close , " Henderson said . <p> When Henderson removed the hook , he saw that the arteries and veins were in good shape . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-inch wound . <p> " Other than the scar , there should be no problems for him . We all thought he was very nice man , and we believe he will do very well , " Henderson said . <p> He has returned to the site several times . He has thought about the day often . So far , no signs of post-traumatic shock . <p> " No . I do think about it . Relive it . A little stress and depression . But I also realize that as close as I came , I have been given a second chance . Possibly change my way of living . Maybe it was a signal . Maybe try to live a little bit . Do n't focus so much , " he said . <p> Fighting for wife 's health <p> Whether Carstens can control his relentless focus remains to be seen . <p> He has been in a long campaign in behalf of his wife and other people who have become victims of mold . <p> His wife is pretty much confined to their home , contending with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Carstens is director of human services for MoldRelief , an Oklahoma-based national organization . <p> MoldRelief was featured in an article Thursday in The Wall Street Journal .

Still , they look forward . <p> Both of the Carstens were born in northern New Jersey but met in Florida . They moved to Habersham County 10 years ago for a variety of reason , not the least of which " is so that our children could see four seasons . " <p> Their daughter , Lindsay , is 19 and lives in White County ; Matthew , 21 , lives in Florida . <p> The Carstens love living in the rural home .
