TRAVEL IN THE NEW CENTURY Headnote The travel industry turns to biometrics to keep you safe , secure , and speeding through lines . But are these high-tech devices accurate ? And what about your privacy ? BY DANA HAWKINS // In a recent cartoon  --  animated video produced by Japan 's Narita Airport Authority , a carefree girl glides through an airport fuss-free . No waiting in long lines , and no pulling out a boarding pass and ID . Rather , the sprite pauses but a moment at an automated security checkpoint to verify her identity with a smile and a nifty multifunction device . To further shave minutes , she 'd even checked in on her way to the airport via the gadget , which connects to the Internet . Sweet . That sort of frequent-flier fantasy is closer to reality than one might think . What powers the possibility is what 's embedded in the apparatus-a biometric identifier that links the gadget to the girl . Biometric systems measure distinctive physiological characteristics such as fingerprints , hand shape , facial structure , or iris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without our personal biometric device , " says Richard Norton , executive director of the International Biometric Industry Association . " It will be the ultimate in security and convenience for travelers . Such a device could be integrated into everyday items-cell phones , credit cards , key fobs-and might also be used to securely access your laptop , car , or home . Since the beginning of the year , dozens of airports have deployed various biometric systems . Selected frequent fliers landing at London 's Heathrow , Washington 's Dulles International , New York 's JFK , and Amsterdam 's Schiphol airports have volunteered to have their irises scanned to measure distinctive variations and patterns . The information goes into a database and is used on subsequent trips to verify that the passengers are , in fact , who they claim to be . And more airports are installing facial  --  recognition devices at security checkpoints to scan passengers against a database of wanted felons and suspected terrorists . Airports have also placed them in public areas to monitor crowds . But airports are n't the only venues where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests register at Hotel Consul in Bonn , Germany , the form , pressure , and speed of their signatures are filed electronically . Season pass holders to Disney World theme parks in Orlando enter by passing through turnstiles equipped with two-finger geometry readers , and several cruise lines are considering tightening security by adding biometric data to the photo ID on boarding passes . " It would ensure that the same people getting on are those who got off , " says Ted Thompson , executive vice president of the International Council of Cruise Lines . " A gangway guard might be fooled by someone sneaking on in a baseball cap and sunglasses . " Yet biometrics experts warn that these systems are not perfect . In the Tampa entertainment district of Ybor City , local police use facial recognition technology to scan crowds for wanted felons , runaways , and sexual predators . But critics contend that the way officers covertly track pedestrians with pan and zoom camera techniques is highly invasive to privacy . Some biometric devices are inaccurate , or wo n't necessarily increase security . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , irises , or hand geometry to match against , " says Jim Wayman , director of biometrics research at San Jose State University . The accuracy levels of face-scanning systems can also be problematic . Six weeks after test subjects had " enrolled " with an initial face scan , some systems failed to recognize them nearly one-third of the time . Other devices also perform poorly . Some systems can not collect a finger scan from up to 12 percent of users , according to recent tests conducted by the International Biometric Group . That 's because their prints may be worn if subjects are elderly , or damaged if they work in construction or with harsh chemicals ( hairdressers , for instance ) . Turns out , biometric systems are flawed , just as the human beings they verify and identify . Sidebar Can You Fool a Biometric Device ? Sidebar All but the most sophisticated systems can be tricked with a well-constructed fake finger , hand , or eyeball . That 's because few devices , including the two-finger readers at Disney World , Sidebar check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or is otherwise alive . Gordon Levin , an engineer at Disney World , says a pass holder might conceivably create a mold of his fingers so his pals could get in free . But that 's where the human element comes into play . Since operators watch the turnstiles , he claims that cheaters get caught " A kid trying to get in with a fake human hand would raise some suspicion . " // <p>
