Leonard 's of Great Neck <p> I 'm not the pretty sister . <p> I 'm not the smart sister either . I am the funny one . I 've been called that for so long , for so many years , in fact , that all of my life I thought it was one word : Funnyone . <p> If I had to die , and believe me , I do n't want to , but if I had to choose a location , I 'd want to die right here in the ladies ' lounge at Leonard 's of Great Neck . It 's the mirrors . I look slimsational , even in 3-D . I 'm no scientist , but there 's something about the slant of the full-length glass , the shimmer of the blue marble counters , and the golden light of the pavT chandeliers that creates an optical illusion , turning my reflection into a long , lean , pale pink swizzle stick . <p> This is my eighth reception ( third as an attendant ) at Leonard 's La Dolce Vita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island wedding factory . Everyone I know has been married here , or , at least everyone I 'm related to . <p> My sisters and I made our debut as flower girls in 1984 for our cousin Mary Theresa , who had more attendants on the dais than guests at the tables . Our cousin 's wedding might have been a sacred exchange of vows between a man and a woman , but it was also a show , with costumes , choreography , and special lighting , making the bride the star and the groom the grip . <p> Mary T. considers herself Italian-American royalty , so she had the Knights of Columbus form a crossing guard for our entrance into the Starlight Venetian Room . <p> The knights were regal in their tuxedos , red sashes , black capes , and tricornered hats with the marabou plumes . I took my place behind the other girls in the pro-cession as the band played " Nobody Does It Better , " but I turned around to run away as the knights held up their swords to form a canopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I closed my eyes , gripped my bouquet , and bolted under the blades like I was running for sane . <p> Despite my fear of sharp and clanging objects , I fell in love with Leonard 's that day . It was my first Italian formal . I could n't wait to grow up and emulate my mother and her friends who drank Harvey Wallbangers in cut-crystal tumblers while wearing silver sequins from head to toe . When I was nine years old , I thought Leonard 's had class . Never mind that from the passing lane on Northern Boulevard it looks like a white stucco casino on the French Riviera by way of Long Island . For me , Leonard 's was a House of Enchantments . <p> The La Dolce Vita experience begins when you pull up to the entrance . The wide circular driveway is a dead ringer for Jane Austen 's Pemberley and also resembles the valet stand at Neiman Marcus , outside the Short Hills mall . This is the thing about Leonard 's : everywhere you look , it reminds you of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows are reminiscent of the Metropolitan Opera House , while the tiered fountain is strictly Trevi . You almost believe you 're in the heart of Rome until you realize the cascading water is actually drowning out the traffic on I-495 . <p> The landscaping is a marvel of botanical grooming , with boxwood sheared into long rectangles , low borders of yew , privet hedges in cropped ovals , and bayberry sculpted into twirly ice-cream-cone shapes . The manicured shrubs are set in beds of shiny river stones , an appropriate pre-motif to the ice sculptures that tower over the raw bar inside . <p> The exterior lights suggest the strip in Las Vegas , but it 's far more tasteful here , as the bulbs are recessed , giving the place a low , twinkling glow . Topiaries shaped like crescent moons flank the entrance doors . Beneath them , low meatball bushes serve as a base for the birds-of-paradise , which pop out of the shrubs like cocktail umbrellas . <p> The band plays " Burning Down the House " as I take a moment to catch my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time on my sister Jaclyn 's wedding day and I like it . It 's been a long one . I 'm holding the tension of the entire family in the vertebrae of my neck . When I marry , I will elope to city hall because my bones ca n't take the pressure of another Roncalli wedding extravaganza . I 'd miss the beer-battered shrimp and the pGtT rillettes , but I 'd survive . The months of planning this wedding nearly gave me an ulcer , and the actual execution bestowed on my right eye a pulsating tic that could only be soothed by holding a frozen teething ring I bogarted from cousin Kitty Calzetti 's baby after the Nuptial Mass . Despite the agita , it 's a wonderful day , because I 'm happy for my baby sister , who I remember holding , like a Capodimonte rose , on the day she was born . <p> I hold my martini-shaped evening bag covered in sequins ( the wedding-party gift from the bride ) up to the mirror and say , " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vera Wang to strapless perfection . And I 'd like to thank Spanx , the girdle genius , who turned my pear shape into a surfboard . " I move closer to the mirror and check my teeth . It ai n't an Italian wedding without clams casino dusted in parsley flakes , and you know where those end up . <p> My professional makeup job provided ( at half price ) by the bride 's best friend 's sister-in-law , Nancy DeNoia , is really holding up . She did my face at around eight o'clock this morning , and it 's now supper time but I still look fresh . " It 's the powder . Banane by LeClerc , " my older sister , Tess , said . And she knows : she was matte through two childbirths . We have the pictures to prove it . <p> This morning , my sisters , our mother , and I sat on folding chairs in front of Mom 's Golden Age of Hollywood mirror in the bedroom of their Tudor in Forest Hills , pretty ( almost ) maids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
