Editor - Another bailout to a corporation too big to fail Citigroup . <p> Whatever happened to breaking up large corporations so they do n't dominate the market ? Instead of the Treasury Department bailing out corporations , why does n't the antitrust division of the federal government break up corporations ? At the very least , the bailouts should come with breakups rather than mergers to prevent these " too big to fail " problems in the future . <p> ARMEN SEDRAKIAN <p> Oakland <p> Editor - Reports in The Chronicle on the death of Republicanism are premature . " The death of moderate Republicanism , " Nov. 18 . <p> Two-thousand eight was destined be a Democrat year . The GOP sealed its fate when its moderates , laden with country club guilt , nominated Sen. John McCain , the worst candidate to face a Democrat . Meanwhile , the Democrats , overwhelmed by liberal guilt , abandoned their best product , Sen. Hillary Clinton , and nominated their least-qualified presidential candidate , Sen. Barack Obama . <p> McCain proved the military axiom : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell him much . " McCain refused to expose Obama as an inexperienced leftist with a European worldview . But he did one thing right , as evidenced by the vitriol heaped on Gov . Sarah Palin by the media . Palin connected with voters and propelled McCain into a three-point lead until the September economic meltdown ended the election . She will be back . <p> Fortunately for America , Republicans will not give President Obama the same level of support that the Democrats gave to President Bush . <p> MIKE DeNUNZIO <p> San Francisco <p> Editor - I was shocked and upset to read about Barry Bonds " blasting deer " in your Matier &amp; Ross section " Bonds blasting deer , not baseballs , " Nov. 23 . <p> As a now-former fan and supporter of Barry Bonds , I found it disgraceful that he would shoot a defenseless deer just to promote a gun dealer . Were Barry Bonds in need of food , I would accept such hunting , but his is not such a case . <p> Perhaps he will personally see the parallels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of a court trial for alleged perjury . He , of course , will have much better defense mechanisms than the deer ever had . Camouflage wear wo n't help him there . <p> RALPH A. HERNANDEZ <p> Antioch <p> Editor - The Open Forum piece , " The real issue behind the abortion debate " Nov. 24 , appears to be manipulating and dancing around what the real issue of abortion is , which is destroying the life of a precious baby for the sake of convenience and/or money . In another words , the end justifies the means . <p> Can you remember who else in history made that same claim ? The woman 's womb should be the safest place on Earth , where the innocent should feel protected . <p> This world has become a " me first " generation and we are suffering the effects of that choice . When do we all go back to personal responsibility ? <p> I am certain there will be many excuses coming from your readers to justify their circumstance for their choice . Every person on the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear and they also have been given the free will to choose . I pray that you may make the true choice of life . <p> JULIE AXE <p> San Mateo <p> Editor - Regarding " Assembly chief latest legislator absent during budget crisis " Nov. 21 : I understand that Assembly Speaker Karen Bass absence from Sacramento is a great " are n't your politicians terrible " story . But I think you have some obligation , when writing such a story , to point out that it is not any of the Democratic legislators who are preventing settlement of the budget . <p> The big elephant in the room , the one factor that dominates all others , of course , is the Republican legislators iron-clad " no tax " pledge . They simply allow no room for negotiation . <p> What , then , is there really to negotiate ? <p> What is Speaker Bass missing if the GOP allows no room for real movement on the budget ? <p> DAN BARKI <p> Oakland <p> Editor - I commend Reverend Amos Brown for his courageous stance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it represents . <p> The interplay between the LGBT and African American communities is a complicated one with a troubled history . Yet , it is my hope that these communities may unite in a movement that recognizes the equality of all human beings . <p> Thank you , Rev. Brown , on behalf of so many who admire you , respect you and yearn for more allies like you . Your brave actions serve to inspire and unite us . <p> RYAN KERIAN <p> San Francisco <p> Editor - Your article " Bloom and Gloom - a warning from plankton " Nov. 21 , clearly shows the imminent danger of extinction of marine animals that rely on phytoplankton for their existence . <p> This involves a major destruction of the web of life , from gray whales to migratory birds . Are n't people sufficiently informed of our individual responsibility concerning global warming and these upcoming disasters ? <p> I think no one can claim ignorance by now of our role in the destruction of our natural world . Yet , a short visit to cities like Walnut Creek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas guzzling vehicles seems to outnumber all others on the road . This is very alarming to me . <p> If apathy and denial prevail , what are the chances for the survival of our world ? <p> ELENA MAROTH <p> Kensington <p> YES <p> Editor - San Francisco must create a college-going culture . I commend Superintendent Carlos Garcia 's proposal to require every graduating senior to pass the college preparation classes required for admission to the CSU " S.F. schools chief wants more from graduates , " Nov. 21 . <p> The superintendent 's plan mirrors that of our own . San Francisco State University has a longstanding commitment to San Francisco 's young people . Called SF Promise , our commitment is reflected in a formal partnership with the city and county of San Francisco and the San Francisco Unified School District : The commitment is simple : If public school students meet eligibility requirements upon high school graduation , they are promised admission to San Francisco State and , if necessary , financial aid . <p> In spite of the recent proposed budget cuts , the SF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco : to increase the number of students who receive a college education . Graduating college-ready high school seniors is a vital first step . <p> ROBERT A. CORRIGAN <p> President San Francisco State University <p> NO <p> Editor - San Francisco schools Superintendent Carlos Garcia 's proclamation that all students in the system must pass all the college prep courses required for UC/CSU admission is sheer lunacy . <p> These disingenuous calls for lofty standards have become top administrators stock in trade as they attempt to appease education critics and to mollify the general public who collectively perceive our schools to be abject failures . <p> When will we disabuse ourselves of the notion that every student is college material ? When will we return honor and dignity to the industrial arts and other vocational trade programs that address the energies and aptitudes of the countless students whose skills and interests are not in the academic realm ? <p> MARK WARDLAW Santa Rosa <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
