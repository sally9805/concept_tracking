Section : Nation &; World Lyndon Johnson was undone by Vietnam . George Bush is mired in Iraq . Are the comparisons fair ? <p> At the White House , they call it the " V " word . Vietnam . It is the historical parallel that the Bush administration dreads most , because of fears that comparisons with the bitter , bloody Southeast Asian conflict will cast even more doubt on the conduct of the war in Iraq today . " Entirely different situations , " White House Press Secretary Tony Snow told U.S. News . <p> But the idea that Iraq increasingly resembles Vietnam in some important ways appears to be gaining credibility among historians , pundits , and , most important , the public . While 50 percent of Americans think the United States will avoid another Vietnam-which was far more costly in terms of human life and military spending-40 percent think the United States is " heading for the same kind of involvement in Iraq as it had in the Vietnam War , " according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll taken in mid-October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed that the current spike in Iraqi violence reminded him of the Tet offensive in 1968 . That 's when attacks across Vietnam seemed to under-mine President Lyndon Johnson 's claims that there was light at the end of the tunnel . Bush conceded that , in a similar manner , Iraqi insurgents may be trying to break America 's will today . <p> The comparisons will only intensify as Bush prepares to visit Vietnam for a high-profile economics conference next week and as frustrations with the course of the war in Iraq grow . " People see Iraq as an echo of the experience of Vietnam , " says historian Robert Dallek , biographer of President Johnson , who escalated the Vietnam War in the mid- and late 1960s . " We got trapped there in a quagmire . And today , there is a sense once again that , like Vietnam , we are caught in a trap of our own making , and there is no way out . " <p> Such assessments are vigorously challenged by President Bush and his senior aides . The war in Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media reports , and the administration has an effective strategy to eventually turn security over to the democratically elected Iraqi government . White House counselor Dan Bartlett conceded that Americans are frustrated , but he said that 's mostly because " they want to know we can win . " And Bush is confident of victory , Bartlett told U.S. News . <p> But those arguments are being aggressively challenged by the critics , some of whom cite eerie parallels with Vietnam . Johnson and , later , President Richard Nixon said they would turn over security to the South Vietnamese , and the plan failed . <p> It is also true that in each case , America 's commander in chief immersed the nation in a faraway conflict for reasons that turned out to be misleading or just plain wrong . In each case , the cost in lives and treasure-and the strength and tenacity of the opposition-exceeded the government 's initial estimates . In each case , as opposition mounted at home and abroad , the exit strategy seemed unclear . And in each case , a president who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priorities shunted aside . <p> Vietnam " engulfed " the Johnson presidency , as Iraq is threatening to do to Bush 's , says Boston University historian Julian Zelizer . And as the going got tougher , a " feeling of helplessness " eroded each president 's popularity . Bush 's approval rating today stands at only 34 percent , largely because of Iraq , just about where it was for Johnson in August 1968 . <p> There are many differences between the two wars , of course . Today , there is no military draft , which intensified opposition to the Vietnam War . The level of casualties was much higher in Vietnam , where often some 500 American troops died every month . In contrast , 105 U.S. troops died in Iraq in October , the highest monthly total in a year . Vietnam was more a true civil war , with north divided from south , where Iraq is far more complex , inflamed by ethnic strife complicated by a grab bag of variously motivated insurgents . <p> And yet the parallels seem to be a growing part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens there next . THE ROOTS OF WAR <p> Both Johnson and Bush , two tough-talking Texans , offered justifications for war that turned out to be tragically flawed . LBJ used an alleged confrontation between U.S. and North Vietnamese forces in the Gulf of Tonkin to win Senate approval for a resolution authorizing him to escalate the conflict in Vietnam . LBJ argued that on the cloudy night of Aug. 4 , 1964 , the North Vietnamese attacked two Navy destroyers , the USS Maddox and C. Turner Joy , without provocation . Johnson and other U.S. officials either distorted or misunderstood on-scene observations from Navy personnel and intercepts of enemy communications . Whatever the reason , they made it look as if the attacks happened , when they did n't . " In truth , Hanoi 's Navy was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two of the boats " damaged in a confrontation with the Maddox two days earlier , wrote historian Robert Hanyok in a government report that came to light last year . Similarly , Bush and his senior advisers said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it did n't . Bush has blamed faulty intelligence , but the erroneous claims have badly eroded his credibility . <p> Both presidents saw their wars as part of a broader international struggle . Johnson believed that if Vietnam fell to the Communists , other nations would follow . Bush sees the Iraq war as a " central front " in another type of global war-a fight with an Islamic jihadism . If Iraq falls , Bush warns , the terrorists will seek to topple other regimes and , eventually , attack the United States again . <p> In 1966 , as Johnson was preparing to escalate the war , he told aides that America 's technological might would easily overcome what he called a " raggedy-ass little fourth-rate country . " Massive bombing , Johnson said , would bring the North Vietnamese to their knees ; it did n't . Added David Halberstam in The Best and the Brightest : " The principals never defined either the mission or the number of troops .. There was never a clear figure and clear definition of what the strategy would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made similar blunders . The Bush team consistently underestimated the need for more U.S. troops in Iraq . Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other members of the administration initially argued that the Iraqis would welcome American forces as liberators , as Robert McNamara , another hard-charging Pentagon boss , had argued during Vietnam . Yet the struggle for Iraqi " hearts and minds , " to borrow a Vietnam-era phrase , is n't exactly going real well . CONFLICT MANAGEMENT <p> LBJ 's strategy of " limited war " prevented U.S. forces from entering North Vietnamese sanctuaries in Cambodia and Laos , which guaranteed that the United States could never deliver a knockout blow . Bush is in a similar predicament because the opposition is so diffuse and elusive . " In both cases , we have the problem where you divert your forces to one area and occupy it , but the moment you leave , the enemy comes right back , " says Rep. John Murtha , a Pennsylvania Democrat , Vietnam veteran , and critic of the Iraq war . " The other thing that is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming force , much like they had to in Vietnam , to protect our people in Iraq .. But when you use that kind of force , you end up killing civilians on the ground , and that 's when you turn the hearts and minds against you . " <p> LBJ had a penchant for micromanaging-the U.S. Air Force , he once boasted , could n't bomb an outhouse without his say-so . Bush conducts himself much differently , he told conservative columnists recently : " Remember the pictures in the Oval Office , with them sitting over the maps , picking out the targets in Vietnam ? That 's not happening in this war . " There are also fundamental differences in how the two presidents have responded emotionally . Luci Johnson , LBJ 's daughter , once recalled : " He 'd be looking at the TV set and they 'd be giving reports on fatalities that day , and it was as if you were looking at a man who had a knife thrust into the pit of his stomach . . He just physically looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as a stateside Air National Guard pilot during Vietnam ) compartmentalizes . He weeps with the families of slain troops-with whom he meets regularly in private . But he does n't let the emotional toll weaken his resolve . " He feels that 30 , 40 , 50 years from now he 'll be seen to have made the right decision in Iraq , " a senior adviser says . <p> And he still can enjoy himself . " He keeps the mood light , " says an aide . On a recent trip back from campaign stops in Michigan and Iowa , the president came to the conference room on Air Force One and joined a game of gin rummy with Karl Rove and a few other staff members . With the World Series underway , the talk soon turned to baseball . Bush reminisced about his days as managing partner of the Texas Rangers and revealed an insider 's knowledge of the lineups of the St. Louis Cardinals and the Detroit Tigers . CREDIBILITY GAPS <p> A huge blow to the U.S. war effort in Vietnam began in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Tet-when an estimated 75,000 fighters from North Vietnam and the Viet Cong launched coordinated attacks against South Vietnam 's five largest cities , 100 other cities and towns , and scores of allied military bases . This came only two months after Gen. William Westmoreland , the U.S. commander in South Vietnam , declared that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong were so chewed up they could barely pursue large-scale offensive operations . Tet cost the lives of 2,000 Americans and 4,000 South Vietnamese troops . Militarily , American troops scored a victory ; 40,000 of the enemy were killed . But Tet called U.S. claims into question ; it showed the war could go on for years-and it did . <p> Johnson and many military officers blamed the news media for failing to portray Tet as a military defeat for the enemy , part of their larger contention that the media undermined support for the war by focusing on bad news . Today , Bush makes similar charges against the media for focusing on the negative in Iraq . " It 's maddening for us , " says a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting in Iraq will be vindicated , as it was-mostly-in Vietnam , and they point to a 1989 study for the Army by historian William Hammond , entitled " The Military and the Media . " It found that " what alienated the American public in both the Korean and Vietnam wars was not news coverage but casualties . " When casualties jumped , public support dropped . Hammond said that despite serious shortcomings in military journalism , " the press reports were still often more accurate than the public statements of the administration in portraying the situation in Vietnam . " Today , though many Americans distrust the media , they also have doubts about whether the president is talking straight . " Bush has a very big credibility problem in Iraq , " historian Dallek told U.S. News . THE SPECTER OF QUAGMIRE <p> A more fundamental problem is whether America 's resolve can be maintained . Bush warns frequently that the terrorists believe Americans will tire of the Iraq war , and he urges patience . He promises to pursue the war to victory " even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls , Snow says . <p> But , in an eerie harbinger of the current situation in Iraq , North Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong said in 1962 : " Americans do not like long , inconclusive wars-and this is going to be a long , inconclusive war . Thus , we are sure to win in the end . " <p> Johnson and Bush gambled that the indigenous populations in Vietnam and Iraq would eventually take over the fighting and establish stable , democratic governments . That did n't happen in Vietnam , and it is proving very difficult in Iraq . Former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite , who declared the Vietnam War a stalemate after the Tet offensive on Feb. 27 , 1968 , told U.S. News : " I suppose you can say there were big similarities in the long run in Vietnam because it became apparent that we were going to have to create a democracy there as well . And that is n't easy . " <p> LBJ declined to run again in 1968 after he was challenged in the Democratic primaries by antiwar candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , won his narrow re-election victory two years ago , but he 's facing the possibility of considerable setbacks in this week 's elections because of Iraq , which could make him a lame duck . <p> The Vietnam War cost the United States more than 58,000 lives and claimed hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese . It cost more than $500 billion in today 's dollars . The Iraq war has claimed more than 2,800 American lives and tens of thousands of Iraqis so far . The financial cost of the Iraq war is expected to reach $320 billion in the coming months and is running at about $2 billion per week-far more than initial estimates . <p> And consider this : After Johnson left office , in January 1969 , the conflict continued for more than six years . The last U.S. combat troops did n't leave Saigon until 1973 , and South Vietnam , trying to go it alone , fell to the North in April 1975 , as frightened residents climbed to the rooftops , hoping , vainly , to be taken along by the fleeing Americans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinning medals on the troops at Cam Ranh Bay in October 1966 .
