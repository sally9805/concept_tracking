Life Scout Kyle Holt // Kyle Holt stands on a wide stretch of sand and stares ahead . There 's a lot of activity here on the shores of Cocoa Beach , Fla. , and a lot of noise . But Kyle does n't hear it . All around him , beachgoers dance in and out of the surf . The Atlantic Ocean is not known for big waves , but try telling that to the competitors here for the Ron Jon Surf and Skim Festival . Kyle sticks the tail end of his skimboard in the sand , crosses his arms atop it , and leans . From a distance , his eyes look closed , a telltale sign that he 's looking into the sun . But make no mistake , Kyle is alert . He 's analyzing the way the waves break on the beach , the wash making the shoreline appear bubbly . The waves swell about 10 yards from the high watermark . Kyle is watching , waiting for his set to roll in . Photograph Photograph Cocoa Beach does n't have big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching big air . // Three other skimmers are taking practice runs . They are Kyle 's competition for the final round of the junior men 's division ( 15 to 17 years old ) . At 15 , Kyle is the youngest finalist , and he beat a field of 26 of the nation 's toughest competitors over a two-day period . Catch Me if You Can " Right before competition , I study the waves to see how I 'm going to get the best ride , " Kyle says three minutes before game time . He watches the waves the way a football coach might watch film of an opposing team . He watches for the breaks and studies patterns . Are the waves breaking east to west or north to south ? Is the wind blowing in from the north , or is it offshore ? " I never watch the guys I 'm going up against before I ride , " he says . " Let them chase me . I just try to get myself focused . " Just as Kyle prepares to make his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die down . They 're squirrelly breakers , crashing too early and too close to the sand . Kyle knows he 's going to have to run fast to catch an offshore swell . He has to impress a panel of judges with various tricks . And he has to land them . A horn sounds , and moments later Kyle takes his board in his hands , his eyes now wide open and dead-set on an incoming wave . He breaks out into a sprint toward a swell . No sooner does he drop the board on the wet sand than his feet are on top and he 's gliding across the water toward the wave . He hits it squarely , and it propels him into the air . The crowd cheers and the announcer bellows out , " Whoa ! A 180 shove-it by Kyle Holt ! " The Brass Ring The idea of skimboarding is to run with your board down the beach at a ferocious rate of speed , then " drop step , " or drop the board and jump on it , riding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done in the shallow surf , two inches to five feet deep . The waves break on the shore , unlike surfing , in which the surfer paddles out into the deep and rides the wave back toward the beach . Serious skimmers like Kyle and professional skimboarder Bill Bryan are using boards at the Cocoa Beach festival manufactured with technology lifted from the aerospace industry . These big-air boards are ultra  --  light-a far cry from those used in the 1920 's when the sport began . ( See " Dancing Across the Water . " ) Skimming for Skimmers In addition to being a nationally recognized skimboarder , Kyle is a Life Scout in Troop 446 , Emerald Isle , N.C. He says his troopmates are just now understanding his sport . Photograph A moment of clarity . Kyle Holt waits for his set to roll in . Kyle squares off with an incoming wave and prepares to execute a trick . Kyle 's muscles tense as he grabs his board and sprints toward an incoming wave . Kyle performs a " wrap . " He crouches so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect drop step : As soon as the skimboard hits the water , Kyle 's feet are on it . Kyle rides the wave out until there 's nothing left but rolling whitewater. // " A lot of people in general do n't appreciate skimboarding , " Kyle says . " My troop is supportive of me . I 'm trying to help people in my troop and others gain an appreciation for it . " Most skimmers want to help their sport grow . Kyle has a recruiting advantage over most . He 's sponsored by Zap Skimboards , and his school posted a Zap Skimboards flier with Kyle 's picture front and center in the trophy case . But Kyle does n't let the publicity or his own celebrity go to his head . " It 's cool to be recognized , but that 's not why I do this , " Kyle says . " I 'm dedicated to seeing this sport grow and being a part of that process . The more competition I have , the beter I get . It keeps me current . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's skimboarding recruits is Troop 446 Eagle Scout Chris West , who made the journey along with Kyle to compete in his first competition . Unluckily for him , Chris drew 2001 Jr . Men 's World Skimboarding champion Morgan Just in the first round and was duly eliminated . Kyle 's been there-it 's all part of the adventure . Kyle and Morgan know each other well . Morgan has had Kyle 's number at recent events , beating him with consistency . Yet his presence here does n't rattle Kyle . " I get more anxious than nervous when I skim against Morgan , " he says . Kyle 's confident that his years of practice and patience have made him a contender . Moment of Truth Back on the beach ( or close to it ) , Kyle lands his trick . The crowd responds with a roar of applause . For the next nine minutes , Kyle attempts trick after trick . Before the competition , he said it did n't matter how he finished . " I just really want to make it to the finals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the 2001 Jr . Men 's World champion and East Coast champion are n't . Both were unable to make it through the semi  --  finals-the sport 's talent pool is growing that fast . Kyle has a chance to steal the show . When the final horn blows , Kyle retreats to the crowd , head up and looking confident , stuck in competition mode for a few moments . He wears the same determined look on his face both before and after the whistle blows . He knows he hit his series of floaters and shove-its . Chris West is one of the first people to run up and congratulate him . " I think I got second , " Kyle says proudly . But he does n't . Kyle finishes in third place " Oh , man . I 'm pretty bummed about that , " he says . " No , I 'm really disappointed . I thought I did good , but I guess I did bad . " " No , you did good , man , " Chris offers . " Oh well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's just how the wave breaks sometimes . " THE KYLE HOLT FILE Photograph SKIM BOARDER KYLE HOLT // BORN : July 8 , 1986 , Morehead City , NC.

Skimboarding dates to 1920 's Southern California , when Laguna Beach lifeguards would take pieces of plywood and ride the breaks down the beach . Riders would flail their arms and legs to try to keep their balance . For someone standing on the beach , this action made the lifeguards appear as if they were dancing across the water . Kyle Holt and professional skimboarder Bill Bryan are taking new board technology and running with it : They are thrusting this sport into the surfing world 's limelight .
