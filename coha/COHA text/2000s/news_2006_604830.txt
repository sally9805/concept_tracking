<p> The nickname  --  Granddaddy of Them All  --  is n't just some chamber of commerce contrivance . <p> The Rose Bowl has cast a sizable shadow across college football 's postseason for the better part of a century , woven not merely into the fabric of a sport but an entire nation 's celebration of each new year . Two powerhouse teams play . The neighboring San Gabriel Mountains stand a silent and stately vigil . The pageantry and tradition practically explode from Pasadena , Calif. , onto television screens worldwide . <p> John Robinson , who played in one Rose Bowl and coached in seven others with Southern California , used to try to take a moment after he and his team took the natural grass field to soak it all in . " I always felt , " he says , " that when you got there you should say , ' Damn , this is good . ' " <p> So what is it that we have tonight , when No.1-ranked USC and No.2 Texas square off for the national championship ? A setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even decades ? Or a game befitting the spectacular , history-drenched setting ? <p> More national championship teams have played in both the Orange and Sugar bowls since they opened for business in the mid-1930s . The Orange has featured as many newly honored Heisman Trophy winners . But Pasadena and the Rose are where bowls began , the first staged in 1902 , the next 90 played successively since 1916 . <p> To that heritage add the locale and , most years but not this one , an afternoon segue from Pasadena 's famous New Year 's Rose Parade . Commercialism is toned down . Halftimes are wholesome . <p> Notable , too , is an intensely loyal partnership with the Pacific-10 and Big Ten conferences . Pasadena remains the ultimate destination for their champions , to a degree that officials in the two leagues insist they 'd play there and sit out a major-college playoff  --  if one ever were implemented . <p> Ah , yes . The playoff conundrum . <p> Public and media clamor for even a modest four- or eight-team tournament has gone unheeded . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rose Bowl in all of that , " says Big 12 Conference Commissioner Kevin Weiberg , who heads the sport 's top-tier Bowl Championship Series . " I think it 's one factor , but it 's only one among several " in heading off any kind of playoff movement . <p> University presidents worry about a playoff 's encroachment on players ' time and academics . Athletics administrators say it would diminish the regular season and all but destroy a bowl system that 's part of college football 's signature . <p> Still , the Rose crystalizes a number of anti-playoff arguments . Even when the stakes are highest and a title is on the line , as it is for the 12-0 Trojans and 12-0 Longhorns , participating teams are wrapped in a weeklong local celebration . It 's far from the all-business , show-up-and-play routine of a playoff . <p> Multiply that by 28 bowls . Extend the experience to 56 teams , not just the handful that would qualify for a playoff . Roll in an economic impact that , in Southern California , comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl . <p> 90 years of tradition <p> No major sport  --  baseball included  --  reveres tradition more than college football , and the Rose boasts 90 uninterrupted years of it . <p> " It 's just the aura , the ambience , particularly when it 's full . And then you 've got the broad-shouldered San Gabriels sitting there , looking down on all of this , " says the man whose voice has become synonymous with the Rose Bowl , ABC television 's Keith Jackson . <p> " From the minute you go on the air , there 's a different feeling about it . I do n't know what it is . Maybe I 'm crazy as hell . I do n't know . " <p> Weiberg , who apprenticed almost 10 years in the Big Ten before taking charge of the Big 12 , registers simpler appreciation . " All those things , " he says , " allow it to command a certain presence . There 's no doubt about that . " <p> With that has come certain privileges . The Rose 's stature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it a must-get when the BCS was put together eight years ago . So it became one of four BCS games with the FedEx Orange , Nokia Sugar and Tostitos Fiesta bowls . <p> But while the other three are jointly tied to the BCS and TV partner ABC ( and starting next season to Fox ) , the Rose is allowed to operate under separate contracts preserving its affiliation with the Pac-10 and Big Ten and the TV network of their choice . <p> The BCS struck a new four-year , $320million agreement with Fox last November . That was more than 31/2 months after the Rose and its two league partners re-upped with ABC for eight years and $300 million . The BCS deal runs through the 2009 season , the Rose 's through 2013 . Both allow the BCS championship game to continue to rotate among the Orange , Sugar , Fiesta and Rose , with ABC carrying the title game in Pasadena when its turn comes in the 2009 season . <p> What 's ' best for the bowl ' <p> Rose Bowl executive director Mitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equals . <p> " We consider ourselves part of a system , " he says . But " right up front , it was one of the conditions that we would maintain our separate contracts . ABC wanted to keep it that way . We wanted to keep it that way . <p> " We were not trying to be arrogant . We were not trying to be exclusionary . We were trying to maintain our heritage and do what was best for the bowl . " <p> There can be little argument that , throughout its history , the Rose 's management has done that with remarkable effectiveness . <p> It has charted a mostly solitary path in resisting the commercialism so endemic to bowl games today . Under pressure from ABC , the Rose finally took on a presenting sponsor in 1998 ( and is " presented by " CitiBank today ) . But note the lack of a title sponsor and the relative absence of advertising signage inside the 93,000-seat stadium and on the field itself . <p> It allows fewer commercial minutes during its telecast than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear starting lineups or first downs " brought to you by " this company or that . <p> Halftime shows , meanwhile , are strictly old-school . No pyrotechnics or screeching Ashlee Simpsons . The schools ' bands play , period . <p> " What they 're trying to produce , in my opinion , is the best college football game in its purest sense  --  what pure amateur sports should be  --  and they have held their ground , " says former Ohio State quarterback Rex Kern , who played in the 1969 and ' 71 Rose Bowls . " They have dug their feet in and said , ' We are going to stand for something . We are who we are . We know who we are . We 're going to be the best at what we do and how we present our product . ' " <p> " It 's a throwback , " former Big Ten commissioner Wayne Duke says , " to what college football was and ought to be . " <p> The first Rose Bowl actually was a lopsided flop on New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play when Stanford captain Ralph Fisher , his team trailing 49-0 , approached Michigan 's bench to concede . The Wolverines accepted , completing a remarkable 11-0 season in which they outscored opponents 555-0 . <p> Appalled Rose officials gave up football in favor of chariot and , later , ostrich races . In 1916 , they brought it back . And seven years later , they moved their game into the now-familiar stadium built in the old Arroyo Seco river gorge . <p> Season by season , the Rose Bowl 's imprint deepened . Notre Dame made the only bowl appearance in its first 80 years of football in the 1925 Rose . Knute Rockne and the Four Horsemen beat Stanford . Alabama 's 1926 appearance in the Rose , the first by a team from the South , was seen as a turning point in Southern football history and an almost spiritual lift for a region whose psyche had sagged since the Civil War . <p> Nine national champions , from Harvard to Notre Dame to ' Bama to Southern California , played in the Rose from 1919 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.C. , in 1942 because of wartime restrictions on the West Coast after the attack on Pearl Harbor a month earlier , " It got a lot of publicity and again elevated the Rose Bowl above all the others , " ABC 's Jackson notes . <p> The Pac-10 and Big Ten got exclusive access starting in 1947 , and with that started a string of sellouts that has endured to today 's game . <p> As a TV property , the Rose has been gold  --  on or off New Year 's Day , in or out of its traditional 5 p.m . ET slot . It not only boasts the highest average rating for any bowl over the last 17 years ( 14.3 compared with the Orange 's next-best 12.6 ) , that needle barely moves ( an average of 14.0 ) when the Rose and its participating teams are n't part of the national title picture . <p> The Orange 's and Sugar 's averages both dip beneath 10.0 when no title is at stake , and the Fiesta 's falls to 8.1 . <p> Beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Delany suggests a symbolic element that has long struck a national chord . <p> Starting in the 1940s , the annual trek of teams and fans from Michigan , Ohio and other Big Ten outposts to Southern California " probably represented the migration of the population . ... It was really a breaking open of the country , " Delany says . " So underneath it , there 's meaning there that 's even greater than the football game . <p> " There 's also the ideal location and the juxtaposition of the great weather in the West compared with what 's going on in the frozen East and the Midwest . " <p> So why did the Rose mess with a good thing when it joined the BCS in 1998 ? Protective of tradition , officials in Pasadena initially resisted . The Pac-10 and Big Ten had to work through reservations within their memberships , as well , but the leagues pressed for a unified college postseason . <p> Most in the Rose family still find it jarring when a Pac-10 or Big Ten champion ranked first or second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another bowl and a replacement arrives from another conference . Or when the title game lands in the Rose and , again , it 's some outside team or teams on the field . <p> Yes , Texas , that means you . <p> Traditionalists may be soothed next season , when the BCS expands its format from four to five games . The Pac-10 and Big Ten champions again will be locked firmly in the Rose as it and the Orange , Sugar and Fiesta are played while the Nos.1 and 2 teams wait to meet for the national title a week later . That game will rotate among the four BCS bowl sites . <p> Passing muster in Pasadena <p> As for future tweaks to the BCS , they 'll have to pass muster in Pasadena . One discussed alternative to next year 's new setup was playing the four bowl games as a sort of semifinal round , re-ranking the winning teams and advancing the top two to the national title game . <p> Uh-uh , the Rose and its partners said . Too suggestive of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeded , and that could send the Pac-10 and Big Ten representatives in different directions . And the Rose a ... semifinal ? <p> " I think there 's a feeling it has sometimes been a bit of an impediment to talking about improvement or change in the structure , " Weiberg says , acknowledging some resulting tension within the BCS . " And my sense is that 's going to be there into the future . " <p> The Granddaddy has bent tradition as far as it comfortably can . <p> No one is quite sure where or when the Rose got the nickname . ABC 's Jackson , who called his first Rose as a member of Washington 's play-by-play team in 1960 , winters in Sherman Oaks , Calif . He remembers first reading it in the Pasadena Star-News sometime in the ' 40s . <p> " The attitude of people around here , " he says , " was , ' We came first , and we 're going to do what we want to do with what we 've got . And what we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " <p> Tonight delivers an exclamation point . The sport 's biggest game . Playing out on its grandest stage .
