<p> A spring drive up Sheridan Road on the North Shore is a tour of some of the area 's most expensive homes . <p> While many of the old lakefront mansions and estates are gone , a new generation of luxury housing is going up to meet the needs of a maturing population . <p> Custom builder Steven Sanderman of Benjamin Builders specializes in building homes in the $800,000 to $1.5 million range in the eastern sections of Glencoe and Highland Park . <p> " Business is good if you are in the right market , like Highland Park or Glencoe , " Sanderman said . <p> The luxury market is pretty much the only market for new homes in the prime property within a few minutes walk or drive from Lake Michigan , he said . <p> " It 's difficult to stay in the $700,000s and build new construction , " he said . " The land is so expensive . You ca n't get that low . <p> " In Highland Park and Glencoe , it 's difficult to get something under $1 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can still do it if you come off the lake a little . " <p> As higher-priced homes are built , land values go up . As land values go up , so do the next round of home prices . When the land near the lake is too dear , builders and buyers look farther west . <p> Older suburbs , such as Highland Park and Deerfield , have made major efforts to develop and improve their downtown areas , he said . This also increases prices . <p> " Deerfield has done so much work to the town that it makes the land more desirable , " Sanderman said . " Everybody wants to be in a walk-to-town location . And there are only so many of them . " <p> The suburbs with the most expensive home sales in recent years tend to have been along the lake . Bannockburn , Kenilworth , Winnetka , Glencoe and Lake Forest lead a survey compiled last year for the Chicago Sun-Times by the Chicago Association of Realtors . Three west suburbs  --  Hinsdale , Oak Brook and Burr Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location is not enough , Sanderman said . At luxury prices , buyers expect lots of space and top workmanship , finishes , fixtures and appliances . <p> Sanderman is building a home at 991 Bob-O-Link in Highland Park . The stately two-story will have about 3,600 square feet on two levels , or 5,000 square feet including the finished basement . <p> " There are hardwood floors across the first floor , " he said . " We do a three-quarter-inch , red oak select . We use slate tile in the laundry room . There 's a lot of detail work with upgraded trim packages . The dining room , living room and den all have a crown molding , chair rail and a nice bead board . " <p> Granite countertops are expected in luxury kitchens these days , along with brand name appliances such as Sub-Zero refrigerators , Viking ranges , Bosch dishwashers and General Electric 's Monogram series of stainless steel products , he said . <p> " There 's beautiful brick in front , with archways , and a cement board product for the siding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added . " People want a single-family home , but they want less maintenance . " <p> The price of the home is $1.395 million , which he said " is a good value for that street . " <p> The homes at River 's Edge , north of St. Charles , are on rolling land overlooking the Fox River . A river view , a lake , a pond or woods all increase the desirability of a home , said Court Airhart , president of Airhart Construction . <p> Airhart is building semi-custom houses that start at about $700,000 and are on 1/2-acre lots . <p> " When people think of luxury homes , there are two things to consider , " Airhart explained . " There 's fit and finish , and there 's square footage . I think it 's more fit and finish . " <p> It used to be that someone could build a house with 3,300 or 3,400 square feet of space and call it a luxury home , he said . " Now it 's the fit and finish  --  the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what sets things apart . " <p> His houses have grown to 3,500 to 4,500 square feet . Some of the rooms are paneled . Ceilings are 10 feet tall on the first floor , instead of the standard 9 feet . <p> Built-in cabinets and shelves are big , he said , in the kitchen , butler 's pantry , master suite , family room and library . <p> " An oak floor is now just an oak floor , " Airhart said . " People are looking for wider planks , maple or cherry . We have inlays , combinations of wood and stone in foyers for a very interesting focal point . " And buyers know the differences in quality , he said . They are more educated and frequently bring in pictures or stories about features they want . And they usually can get what they want , he said . <p> Master suites are now " master retreats , " according to North Shore custom architect and builder Charles L. Page . <p> " Today 's master suites are outfitted to the heights of luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is busy , hectic and sometimes stressful , " Page said . " People are far better educated about medical matters , and they understand the need for stress reduction and exercise . " <p> Workout rooms have been added to some master suites , he said . These are separate from exercise areas that the rest of the family might use . <p> Stress-reduction aids in the suite retreats include sitting rooms with fireplaces , plasma televisions , " morning kitchens , " custom dressing rooms , steam showers and whirlpool tubs . Others he has built had private balconies and decks with whirlpool tubs . <p> Page has worked on more than 300 custom homes in Winnetka , Kenilworth , Wilmette , Northfield , Riverwoods , Lake Forest and Lake Bluff . <p> Northwest suburban Long Grove has managed to maintain its atmosphere as a country village while dealing in luxury housing . <p> At Brookstone , Homes by Richmond has accomplished this by placing only 14 custom homes on 13/4-acre lots surrounded by 400 acres of forest preserve . Prices start at $1.3 million . <p> The architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with multiple elevations , octagonal turrets , stone patios and balconies with wrought-iron railings . <p> The look is carried inside with metal balustrades in the marble entryway , curved walls , French doors , maple or cherry flooring , sculpted limestone or marble fireplaces and tray and box ceilings . <p> For the creature comforts , there is a 5,000-square-foot lower level with sauna and hot tub , billiard room , sports room with five TVs and a computerized home control system . The fun extends outside to a wet bar , grill and fireplace . <p> Sites near Lake Michigan , the Fox River or a forest preserve or woods all give added value and exclusivity to a luxury home . They tend to lock in the view , add a touch of nature and guard against changes to the neighborhood . <p> Golf-course developments provide touches of nature and greenery and frequently a pond or stream . The proximity to a country club also adds security and membership amenities , such as recreation and dining . <p> The Reserve at Merit Club in Libertyville places large-scale homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf course . <p> Merit Homes ' Emerald Greens neighborhood will have custom homes with up to about 6,000 square feet , or more than 8,000 square feet with a completely finished basement . Prices start at $800,000 . <p> Of their seven basic plans , four have first-floor master suites and two are ranch plans . <p> " Many of our customers like to have the luxury of living on one floor and sending the kids upstairs , or maintaining the second level strictly for guests and relatives , " explained Jeri King , director of sales and marketing . <p> Their Lachland model has a 22-by-15-foot master suite with a walk-in closet , walk-in shower with seat and hand-held showerhead , whirlpool tub , double-bowl vanity and separate dressing table . <p> In addition to other luxury features , it has a laundry room on each floor . The finished lower level has a 10-foot ceiling , a guest suite and a recreation area , fireplace and wet bar . The home is available for $1.62 million . <p> Features in all homes include maple and oak flooring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake roofs , zoned temperature controls , security and fire systems , 3-car garages and patios . <p> All luxury homes do n't start out that way . Many builders are finding that some buyers will choose more modestly priced homes and then " load them up " with expensive optional finishes and furnishings until they reach upper levels . <p> At Riverwalk Place on the Fox River in McHenry , some of the customers have been couples who are buying the luxury town houses on the water as second homes , said Curt Langille , president of Lanco Development . <p> The town houses include an adjacent boat slip on Boone Lagoon on the Fox River . <p> " We are getting the empty-nester , the 50-something , primarily , who is buying as a Midwest , summer vacation residence , " Langille said . " They also have properties in Florida or Arizona and so on . <p> " They want a lot of nice , fancy features , " he added . " They are going for the marble floors , granite slabs and Kohler sinks  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " <p> The features are the sort of extras that he would put into the custom and semi-custom homes that Lanco also builds , he said . The 2- and 3-bedroom town houses start in the high $300,000s to low $400,000s , before all the extras . <p> Benjamin Builders , 1282 Old Skokie Road , Highland Park , ( 847 ) 579-1000 . <p> River 's Edge , Illinois 31 and Red Gate Road , St. Charles .
