Once you get past the overall irony of the situation , you realize that killing a guy in the middle of his own health club has a lot to recommend it . The target was a yakuza , an iron freak named Ishihara who worked out every day in a gym he owned in Roppongi , one of Tokyo 's entertainment districts . Tatsu had told me the hit had to look like natural causes , like they always do , so I was glad to be working in a venue where it was far from unthinkable that someone might keel over from a fatal aneurysm induced by exertion , or suffer an unlucky fall onto a steel bar , or undergo some other tragic mishap while using one of the complicated exercise machines . One of these eventualities might even be immortalized in the warnings corporate lawyers would insist on placing on the next generation of exercise equipment , to notify the public of yet another unnatural use for which the machine was not intended and for which the manufacturer would have to remain blameless . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipient of at least two such legal encomia-one on a bridge traversing the polluted waters of the Sumida River , in which a certain politician drowned in 1982 ( " Warning-Do Not Climb On These Bars " ) ; another , a decade later , following the aquatic electrocution of an unusually diligent banker , on the packaging of hair dryers ( " Warning-Do Not Use While Bathing " ) . The health club was also convenient because I would n't have to worry about fingerprints . In Japan , where costumes are a national pastime , a weightlifter would n't pump iron without wearing stylish padded gloves any more than a politician would take a bribe in his underwear . It was a warm early spring for Tokyo , portending , they said , a fine cherry blossom season , and where else but at a gym could a man in gloves have gone unnoticed ? In my business , going unnoticed is half the game . People put out signals-body language , gait , clothes , facial expression , posture , attitude , speech , mannerisms-that can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . Most importantly , do they fit in . Because if you do n't fit in , the target will spot you , and after that you wo n't be able to get close enough to do it right . Or the rare uncorrupt cop will spot you , and you 'll have some explaining to do . Or a countersurveillance team will spot you , and then-congratulations ! - the target will be you . But if you 're attentive , you begin to understand that the identifying signals are a science , not an art . You watch , you imitate , you acquire . Eventually , you can shadow different targets through different societal ecosystems , remaining anonymous in all of them . Anonymity was n't easy for me in Japan when my parentage was a matter of public record and schoolyard taunts . But today , you would n't spot the Caucasian in my face unless someone tipped you off that it was there to be found . My American mother would n't have minded that . She had always wanted me to fit in in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features had prevailed in that initial genetic struggle for dominance . And the plastic surgery I had undergone when I returned to Japan after my fling with U.S. Special Forces in Vietnam largely completed the job that chance and nature had begun . The story my signals would tell the yakuza was simple . He 'd only begun seeing me at his gym recently , but I was already obviously in shape . So I was n't some middle-aged guy who 'd decided to take up weightlifting to try and regain a lost college-era physique . The more likely explanation would be that I worked for a company that had transferred me to Tokyo , and , if they had sprung for digs near Roppongi , maybe in Minami-Aoyama or Azabu , I must be someone reasonably important and well compensated . That I was apparently into body building at all at this stage in my life probably meant affairs with young women , for whom a youthful physique might ameliorate the unavoidable emotional consequences of sleeping with an older man in what at root would be little more than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handbags and the other implicit currencies of such arrangements . All of which the yakuza would understand , and even respect . In fact , my recent appearance at the yakuza 's gym had nothing to do with a company transfer-it was more like a business trip . After all , I was in Tokyo just to do a job . When the job was finished , I would leave . I 'd done some things to generate animosity when I 'd been living here , and the relevant parties might still be looking for me , even after I 'd been away for a year , so a short stay was all I could sensibly afford . Tatsu had given me a dossier on the yakuza a month earlier , when he 'd found me and persuaded me to take the job . From the contents , I would have concluded that the target was just mob muscle , but I knew he must be more than that if Tatsu wanted him eliminated . I had n't asked . I only wanted the particulars that would help me get close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yakuza 's cell phone number . I had fed it to Harry , who , compulsive hacker that he was , had long since penetrated the cellular network control centers of Japan 's three telco providers . Harry 's computers were monitoring the movements of the yakuza 's cell phone within the network . Any time the phone got picked up by the tower that covered the area around the yakuza 's health club , Harry paged me . Tonight , the page had come at just after eight o'clock , while I was reading in my room at the New Otani hotel in Akasaka-Mitsuke . The club closed at eight , I knew , so if the yakuza was working out there after hours there was a good possibility he 'd be alone . What I 'd been waiting for . My workout gear was already in a bag , and I was out the door within minutes . I caught a cab a slight distance from the hotel , not wanting a doorman to hear or remember where I might be going , and five minutes later I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hated to use such a direct route because doing so afforded me limited opportunity to ensure that I was n't being followed , but I had only a little time to pull this off the way I 'd planned , and I decided it was worth the risk . I had been watching the yakuza for over a month now , and knew his routines . I 'd learned that he liked to vary the times of his workouts , sometimes arriving at the gym early in the morning , sometimes at night . Probably he assumed the resulting unpredictability would make him hard to get to . He was half right . Unpredictability is the key to being a hard target , but the concept applies to both time and place . Half-measures like this guy 's will protect you from some of the people some of the time , but they wo n't save you for long from someone like me . Strange , how people can take adequate , even strong security measures in some respects , while leaving themselves vulnerable in others . Like double-locking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes the phenomenon is caused by fear . Fear not so much of the requirements , but rather of the consequences of life as a hard target . Seriously protecting yourself calls for the annihilation of ties with society , ties that most people need the way they need oxygen . You give up friends , family , romance . You walk through the world like a ghost , detached from the living around you . If you were to die in , say , a bus accident , you 'd wind up buried in an obscure municipal graveyard , just another John Doe , no flowers , no mourners , hell , no mourning . It 's natural , probably even desirable , to be afraid of all this . Other times there 's a form of denial at work . Circuitous routes , extensive security checks , an ongoing internal dialogue consisting of If I were trying to get to me , how would I do it ? all require a deep acceptance of the notion that there are people out there who have both the motive and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion is innately uncomfortable for the human psyche , so much so that it produces enormous stress even for soldiers in battle . A lot of guys , the first time they come under close-range fire , they 're shocked . " Why 's he trying to kill me ? " they 're asking themselves . " What did I ever do to him ? " Think about it . Ever look in a closet or under the bed , when you 're alone in the house , to ensure that an intruder is n't hiding there ? Now , if you really believed that the Man in the Black Ski Mask was lurking in those places , would you behave the same way ? Of course not . But it 's more comfortable to believe the danger only in the abstract , and to act on it only half-heartedly . That 's denial . Finally , and most obviously , there is laziness . Who has the time or energy to inspect the family car for improvised explosive devices before every drive ? Who can afford a two-hour , roundabout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached directly in ten minutes ? Who wants to pass up a restaurant or bar just because the only seats available face the wall , not the entrance ? Rhetorical questions , but I know how Crazy Jake would have answered . The living , he would have said . And the ones who intend to go on that way . Which leads to an easy rationalization , one that I 'm sure is common to people who have taken lives the way I have . If he 'd really wanted to live , the rationalization goes , I would n't have been able to get to him . He would n't have permitted himself that weakness , the one that did him in . The yakuza 's weakness was his addiction to weights . Who knows what fueled it-a history of childhood bullying that made him want to appear visibly strong afterward , an attempt to overcome a feeling of inadequacy born of being naturally slighter of build than Caucasians , some suppressed homoeroticism like the one that drove Mishima . Maybe some of the same impulses that had led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsession had nothing to do with health , of course . In fact , the guy was an obvious steroid abuser . His neck was so thick it looked as though he could slide a tie up over his head without having to loosen the knot , and he sported acne so severe that the club 's stark incandescent lighting , designed to show off to maximum effect the rips and cuts its members had developed in their bodies , cast small shadows over the pocked landscape of his face . His testicles were probably the size of raisins , his blood pressure likely rampaging through an overworked heart . I 'd also seen him explode into the kind of abrupt , unprovoked violence that is another symptom of steroid abuse . One night , someone I had n't seen before , no doubt one of the club 's civilian members who liked the location and thought that rubbing elbows with reputed gangsters made them tougher by osmosis , started removing some of the numerous iron plates that were weighing down the bar the yakuza had been using to bench-press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a break , and the new guy must have mistakenly assumed this meant he was through . The guy was pretty sizable himself , his colorful Spandex sleeveless top showing off a weightlifter 's chest and arms . Someone probably should have warned him . But the club 's membership consisted primarily of chinpira-low-level young yakuza and wanna-be punks-not exactly good Samaritan types who were interested in helping their fellow man . Anyway , you have to be at least mildly stupid to start disassembling a bar like the one the yakuza was using without looking around for permission first . There were probably a hundred and fifty kilos on it , maybe more . Someone nudged the yakuza and pointed . The yakuza , who had been squatting , reared up and bellowed , " Orya ! " loud enough to vibrate the plate glass in the front of the rectangular room . What the fuck ! Everyone looked up , as startled as if there had been an explosion-even the new guy who had been so clueless just an instant earlier . Still bellowing expletives , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job of using his voice , either by instinct or design , to disorient his victim . Everything about the yakuza-his words , his tone , his movement and posture-screamed Attack ! But the man was too frozen , either by fear or denial , to move off the line of assault . And although he was holding a ten-kilo iron plate with edges considerably harder than the yakuza 's cranium , the man did nothing but drop his mouth open , perhaps in surprise , perhaps in inchoate and certainly futile apology . The yakuza blasted into him like a rhino , his shoulder driving into the man 's stomach . I saw the man try to brace for the impact , but again he failed to move off the line of attack and his attempt was largely useless . The yakuza drove him backward into the wall , then unleashed a flurry of crude punches to his head and neck . The man , in shock now and running on autopilot , dropped the plate and managed to raise his arms to ward off a few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attempted blocks out of the way and kept on punching . I saw one of his shots connect to the left side of the man 's neck , to the real estate over the carotid sinus , and the man began to crumble as his nervous system overcompensated from the shock of the blow by reducing blood pressure to the brain . The yakuza , feet planted widely as though he had an axe and was splitting logs , continued to hammer at the top of his victim 's head and neck . The man fell to the floor , but retained enough consciousness to curl up and protect himself to some extent from the hail of kicks that followed . Huffing and swearing , the yakuza bent and caught the prostrate man 's right ankle between an enormous biceps and forearm . For a moment , I thought he was going to apply a jujitsu leglock and try to break something . Instead , he straightened and proceeded to drag the man 's prone form to the club 's entrance and out into the street . He returned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment to catch his breath , resumed his rightful place on the bench without looking at anyone else in the room . Everyone returned to what they were doing : his affiliates , because they did n't care ; the civilians , because they were unnerved . It was as though nothing had happened , although the silence in the club indicated that indeed something had . A part of my mind that 's always running in the background logged what I saw as the yakuza 's assets : raw strength , experience with violence , familiarity with principles of continuous attack . Under weaknesses , I placed lack of self-control , shortness of breath after a brief and one-sided fight , relatively minimal damage caused despite ferocity of assault . Unless he was a borderline sociopath , which was statistically unlikely , I knew the yakuza would now be feeling slightly uneasy about what people must have made of his outburst . I took the opportunity to stroll over to the bench-press station and ask him if he needed a spot . " Warui na , " he thanked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple interaction afforded him . " Iya , " I replied . It 's nothing . I stood over him and helped him get the bar in the air . I noted that he was moving a hundred and fifty-five kilos . He managed two repetitions , with some assistance from me on the second . He would still be fully adrenalized from his recent altercation , and I made a mental note of the limits of his strength at this exercise . I helped him guide the bar back onto the uprights , then whistled quietly through my teeth in slightly theatrical deference to his power . I moved to the foot of the bench as he sat up and told him that if he needed another spot , he should just ask me . He nodded his head in gruff thanks and I began to turn away . I paused as though considering whether to add something , then turned back to him . " That guy should have checked to see if you were done with this station , " I said in Japanese . " Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He nodded again , pleased at my astute assessment of the important social service he had provided in pulverizing some harmless idiot , and I knew that he would be comfortable calling on me , his new friend , from time to time when he needed a spot . Like tonight , I hoped . I moved quickly down Gaienhigashi-dori , easing past pedestrians on the crowded sidewalk , ignoring the cacophony of traffic and sound trucks and touts , using the chrome and glass around me to gauge whether there was anyone to my rear trying to keep up . I turned right just before the Roi Roppongi Building , then right again onto the club 's street , where I paused behind a thicket of parked bicycles , my back to the incongruous pink exterior of a Starbucks coffee shop , waiting to see who might be trailing in my wake . A few groups of young partygoers drifted by , caught up in the urgent business of entertaining themselves and failing to notice the man standing quietly in the shadows . No one set off my radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the club . The facility occupied the ground floor of a gray commercial building hemmed in by rusting fire escapes and choked with high-tension wires that clung to the structure 's faade like rotting vegetation . Across from it was a parking lot crowded by Mercedeses with darkened windows and high-performance tires , the status symbols of the country 's elite and of its criminals , each aping the other , comfortably sharing the pleasures of the night in Roppongi 's tawdry demimonde . The street itself was illuminated only by the indifferent glow of a single arched lamplight , its base festooned with flyers advertising the area 's innumerable sexual services , in the shadows of its own luminescence looking like the elongated neck of some antediluvian bird shedding diseased and curling feathers . The shades were drawn behind the club 's plate-glass windows , but I spotted the yakuza 's anodized aluminum Harley-Davidson V-Rod parked in front , surrounded by commuter bicycles like a shark amidst pilot fish . Just past the windows was the entrance to the building . I tried the door , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club windows and tapped on the glass . A moment later the lights went off inside . Nice , I thought . He had cut the lights so he could peek through the shades without being seen from outside . I waited , knowing he was watching me and checking the street . The lights went back on , and a moment later the yakuza appeared in the entranceway to the building . He was wearing gray sweatpants and a black cut-away A-shirt , along with the obligatory weightlifting gloves . Obviously in the middle of a workout . He opened the door , his eyes searching the street for danger , failing to spot it right there in front of him . " Shimatterun da yo , " he told me . Club 's closed . " I know , " I said in Japanese , my hands up , palms forward in a placating gesture . " I was hoping someone might be here . I was going to come by earlier but got held up . You think I could squeeze in a quick one ? Just while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hesitated , then shrugged and turned to go back inside . I followed him in . " How much longer have you got to go ? " I asked , dropping my gear bag and changing out of my unobtrusive khakis , blue oxford-cloth shirt , and navy blazer . I had already slipped on the gloves , as I always did before coming to the club , but the yakuza had n't noticed this detail . " So I can time my workout . " He walked over to the squat station . " Forty-five minutes , maybe an hour , " he said , getting into position under the weight . Squats . What he usually did when he was finished benchpressing . Shit . I slipped into shorts and a sweatshirt , then warmed up with some push-ups and other calisthenics while he did his sets of squats . The warm-up might actually be useful , I realized , depending on the extent of his struggles . A small advantage , but I do n't give anything away for free . When he was through , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yeah . " How much you put up tonight ? " He shrugged , but I detected a slight puffing of his chest that told me his vanity had been kindled . " Not so much . Hundred and forty kilos . Could have done more , but with that much weight , it 's better to have someone spot you . " Perfect . " Hey , I 'll spot you . " " Nah , I 'm already done . " " C'm on , do another set . It inspires me . What are you putting up , twice your body weight ? " My underestimate was deliberate . " More . " " Shit , more than twice your body weight ? That 's what I 'm talking about , I 'm not even close to that . Do me a favor , do one more set , it 'll motivate me . I 'll spot you , fair enough ? " He hesitated , then shrugged and started walking over to the bench-press station . The bar was already set up with the hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think you can handle a hundred and sixty ? " I asked , my tone doubtful . He looked at me , and I could tell from his eyes that his ego had engaged . " I can handle it . " " Okay , this I 've got to see , " I said , pulling two ten-kilo plates off the weight tree and sliding them onto the ends of the bar . I stood behind the bench and gripped the bar about shoulder-width with both hands . " Let me know when you 're ready . " He sat at the foot of the bench , his shoulders hunched forward , and rotated his neck from side to side . He swung his arms back and forth and I heard a series of short , forceful exhalations . Then he lay back and took hold of the bar . " Give me a lift on three , " he said . I nodded . There were several additional sharp exhalations . Then : " One . . . two . . . three ! " I helped him get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . He was staring at the bar as though enraged by it , his chin sunk into his neck in preparation for the effort . Then he let it drop , controlling its descent but allowing enough momentum to ensure a good bounce off his massive chest . Two thirds of the way up , the bar almost stopped , suspended between the drag of gravity and the power of his steroid-fueled muscles , but it continued its shaky ascent until his elbows were straightened . His arms were trembling from the effort . There was no way he had another one in him . " One more , one more , " I urged . " C'm on , you can do it . " There was a pause , and I prepared to try some fresh exhortations . But he was only mentally preparing for the effort . He took three quick breaths , then dropped the bar to his chest . It rose a few centimeters from the impact , then a few more from the northward shove that followed , but a second later it stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he grunted . Help . But calmly , expecting my immediate assistance . The bar continued downward and settled against his chest . " Oi , tanomu , " he said again , more sharply this time . I pushed downward instead . His eyes popped open , searching for mine . Between the weight of the bar and plates and the pressure I was delivering , he was now struggling with almost two hundred kilos . I focused on the bar and his torso , but in my peripheral vision I saw his eyes bulging in confusion , then fear . He made no sound . I continued to concentrate on the clinical downward pressure . With his teeth clenched shut , his chin almost buried in his neck , he threw everything he had into moving the bar . In extremis he was actually able to get the weight off his chest . I hooked a foot under the horizontal supports at the bottom of the bench and used the leverage to add additional pressure to the bar , and again it settled against his chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to shake with exertion . Again the bar moved slightly north . Suddenly I was struck by the reek of feces . His sympathetic nervous system , in desperation , was shutting down nonessential bodily activities , including sphincter control , and diverting all available energy to his muscles . The rally lasted only another moment . Then his arms began to shake more violently , and I felt the bar moving downward , more deeply into his chest . There was a slight hissing as his breath was driven out through his nostrils and pursed lips . I felt his eyes on my face but kept my attention on his torso and the bar . Still he made no sound . Seconds went by , then more . His position did n't change . I waited . His skin began to blue . I waited longer . Finally , I eased off the pressure I had been putting on the bar and released my grip . His eyes were still on me , but they no longer perceived . I stepped back , out of their sightless ambit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it almost was : a weightlifting addict , alone and late at night , tries to handle more than he can , gets caught under the bar , suffocates and dies there . A bizarre accident . I changed back into my street clothes . Picked up my bag , moved to the door . A series of cracks rang out behind me , like the snaps of dried tinder . I turned to look one last time , realizing as I did that the sound was of his ribs giving way . No question , he was done . Only his convulsive grip on the bar remained , as though the fingers refused to believe what the body had already accepted . I stepped into the dark hallway and waited until the street was clear . Then I eased out onto the sidewalk and into the shadows around me.
