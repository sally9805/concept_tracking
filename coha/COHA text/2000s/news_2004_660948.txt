<p> Here on the Air Force Academy 's expansive campus , in the shadow of the Rampart Range , there are n't many outward signs of the cultural sea change that 's occurring . <p> Clean-cut cadets , dressed in blue uniforms , head purposefully to class or the playing fields . There 's little free time , and seniors ( or first-degrees , in Academy jargon ) still complain , as they 've always done , that the entering class has it easier than they did . <p> This year , though , some things are different . For starters , this year 's entering class is the first since 1964 not to enter the gates beneath the old sign exhorting : " Bring Me Men . " They no longer spend hours marching on the tour pad or doing push-ups as punishment . They brandish cellphones , and they had to " run the strip " and carry their bookbag off their shoulder only for the autumn , instead of all the way through March . <p> It 's a kinder , gentler Air Force Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year after a sexual-assault scandal sent shock waves through this campus , forcing resignations of the top leadership and a flurry of congressional and military investigations . When it came out last year that scores of cadets claimed to have been assaulted since 1993 - and , perhaps worse , that those in charge typically punished the victims rather than the perpetrators - a lot of ink went to dissecting academy culture , particularly its hazing and subordination systems <p> It 's too soon to tell if the changes will work : Cultural shifts take decades , not months . Recent accusations about rape among active troops - including the Air Force in the Pacific , and at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas , and troops in the Persian Gulf - only underscore the enormity of the military 's task . Critics worry that the academy 's response is just another surface job , and point to elements , like confidentiality for victims , that are still missing . But it 's striking how much has changed in a year , starting with a leadership that acknowledges the depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journey , " acknowledges Brig . Gen. Johnny Weida , the commandant of cadets , who came to the academy last April . " We 're very optimistic , and hopeful for the future , but we 're realists . We need to manage expectations . " When he arrived at the academy last April , he first tried to discover how widespread the problem really was . What he discovered , he says , is that it was not only systemic , " it was broader than sexual assault or sexual harassment . " <p> Hence the changes , not just on rape response , but on push-ups . <p> Wes Spurlock , a squadron commander from Riverside , Calif. , who plans to go to pilot training in Georgia when he graduates this spring , says the new system has had a big effect on his leadership style : " Last year , if I had four-degrees freshmen messing up , I could just yell at them , have them out doing push-ups . Now I have to get them to want to be better . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dorm rooms and finding one that fails inspection . A year ago , he might have had the cadet pick up his rifle , head to the tour pad , and march in a circle for 10 hours , without considering extenuating circumstances . This year , says Mr. Spurlock , he 'll sit down and talk to the cadet . If it becomes a repeat problem , then a paper trail of disciplinary letters will follow the cadet , even into the Air Force . " It 's harder , it takes more time , " he says . " I have to walk around and talk to people . But you do get to know people better . I 've learned more about these cadets " in his new squadron " than the squadron I was in for two years . " <p> Most cadets like the cultural changes - punishments no longer seem as meaningless and the disciplinary system is more in line with the actual military 's - even as they say the sexual assault problem is n't as great as the outside world seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ' Do n't go off into the woods with someone after Taps ' - common-sense stuff , " says Jordan Wilhelm , an upbeat blond freshman from Mason , Ohio , who 's wanted to go to a military academy since eighth grade . To her , many of those warnings " felt like overkill . " <p> It 's not surprising that some cadets are defensive : Last spring they not only saw their school ripped apart in the media , they also faced judgment closer to home . Some local restaurants asked them to leave ; cars bearing academy stickers got keyed and egged ; and some juniors hoping to bring high school sweethearts in for the spring dance found the women 's parents refused to let them attend . <p> But investigations also showed the scandal 's real scope . One Pentagon study found that 18 percent of female cadets were assaulted at the academy , but only 20 percent of those reported it . Another survey found that 1 in 5 male cadets say women do n't belong at the academy . <p> At this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to change than General Weida . He rattles off the problems , and statistics about rape and sexual assault , with the earnest air of the recently converted . He 's the first to admit the academy - even the Pentagon - does n't have all the answers , which is why he , together with new superintendent Lt. Gen. John Rosa , and vice commandant Col. Debra Gray have called in everyone from academics to rape awareness advocates to help . Bringing other leaders on board has n't been easy either , but Weida says most are starting to buy in . And in the 11 months he 's been there , he 's been able to implement most of the 122 action items on his list from the Pentagon 's " Agenda for Change " that was developed last spring . <p> " Those at the top have been sponges for information , very willing to learn and very dedicated to making changes that will make things better for the victims , " says Anne Munch , director of the Ending Violence Against Women project in Boulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of time on the academy campus this past year . " If it comes from the top down , I think that 's one of the main indicators of whether there will be long-term change . " <p> She and others agree that one of the most important changes has been the development of the Academy Response Team , or ART - an assault-reporting procedure that teams victims up with trained liaisons who can help connect them to any other support people she needs . Weida any other support she needs . Weida is especially encouraged by the increase in assault reports ( 21 since April , 9 of them dealing with prior attacks ) , which he sees as a sign not of more assaults , but of more women feeling comfortable coming forward . And this year , a record number of women - nearly 35 percent more than last year - applied to the academy . <p> Many , of course , are still skeptical . Even with ART , cadets have no confidentiality guarantee when they come forward - an element most rape experts agree is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Pentagon . <p> And all the new rules are virtually meaningless without fundamental changes in the military 's policy for handling assault , says Christine Hansen , director of the Miles Foundation , a nonprofit in Newtown , Conn. , that examines domestic abuse and sexual assault in the military . Ms. Hansen would like to see a new office , for the victim advocate , created at the Pentagon - one which , like the chaplaincy , would have a separate chain of command . <p> " Unless you have a foundation on which to build , " she says , " you can do as much training as you want , but a military commander is still required to rely upon the Uniform Code of Military Justice and manual for court martial , which has n't been updated since the 1950s . " <p> Until those larger changes come about , though , the culture at the academy is slowly shifting . Senior Phaedra Shamp is n't happy about all the new rules - like the fact she can no longer have her fiance and fellow cadet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most changes have been positive . Women , now clustered together in dorms , are more supportive of each other , and discipline is more logical . " People are thinking more about their behavior having an effect on other people , " she says . " And not just in terms of sexual assault . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
