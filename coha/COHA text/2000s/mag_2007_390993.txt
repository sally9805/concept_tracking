The supremely talented designer rocks out with two new lines  --  and proves he has more tricks up his sleeve TEXT BY J.J. MARTIN PHOTOGRAPHS BY JEAN-PAUL GOUDE FASHION EDITOR : MARIE BELTRAMI Just before his succulent fish arrives at his usual table at the Htel de Crillon in Paris , fashion 's favorite sensitive soul , Alber Elbaz , confesses that he is determined to lighten up . " I want to have more fun , " the Lanvin designer declares . It 's easy to believe him , especially when he agrees  --  no , requests  --  to suit up as a disco-era crooner in a floppy red tie and let it rip with his Supremes-like backup for his Bazaar portrait . Levity , however , is just one slice of his very complex emotional core . In fact , halfway through his plate of red mullet , the tables turn and big tears start tumbling down his cheeks . Understandably , it 's been an emotional day . This morning , the Israeli designer attended a funeral for a longtime employee of Lanvin , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they finished the resort and two other special collections destined for New York the following day . " I saw 17 dresses in 20 minutes , " he says , devastated by the lack of attention . " There were all these emergencies , and I was running , saying , " I have an interview ! " And I felt so stupid , and I thought , What 's my job , to talk or to do ? " Wiping his thick-black-framed Lanvin glasses , he is torn up , both mad and sad . " My job is to do , " he finally decides . " My job is to make women beautiful . What do I have to say ? " Photograph : Singing his praises . All dresses and jewelry , prices upon request , Lanvin .

Meanwhile , the female devotees who ruthlessly stalk Lanvin 's Paris boutique are even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the storied French house six years ago . " I buy a separate suitcase just to bring back my Lanvin pieces , " confides costume designer Jacqui Getty , just one devoted fan who travels from L.A. for habitual stocking up . On prodding , Elbaz will talk  --  even if it involves slamming himself down . " A designer crying ! " he chides , cringing at the very idea . It 's actually not so very scandalous , as anyone who knows him will freely admit that he is a man who feels and cares deeply . " I do n't think you can be a designer if you do n't care , " he notes , " or be creative if you are not sensitive . You have to be sensitive in order to feel things and understand people . " The one thing he understands  --  to an astonishing degree  --  is women . With his atelier conveniently located above Lanvin 's store ( which , incidentally , has just been enlarged and completely refurbished ) , Elbaz is more often than not on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observing , and discussing clothes with his clients . " I love women , " he offers simply . " I get along with women more than men , and I have more women friends . " Photograph : Elbaz hits a high note with these looks from his new lines .

" His personal touch with clients is extraordinary , " says Adrian Joffe of the Dover Street Market , an insiders ' hub for Lanvin merch in London . " He makes them feel so special , as if they existed only for him . " Julie Gilhart marvels at the acute attention he devotes to trunk shows at Barneys New York , where she is fashion director . " He says he wants to come for two hours , and then he ends up staying for six hours . No one at his level does that , " she says . But more than impeccable attendance , Elbaz is doing something other designers and , heck , most husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had heard so many female fashion complaints , he decided to take action . " Everyone I know was like , Alber , you know , we 're getting married , I 'm 49 , or I 'm 58 , I 'm 37 , " he says , spewing out endless bridal paradigms . " I have three kids . What should I wear ? " one asked . " I do n't want to look like Cinderella , " wailed another . " I 'm getting married in Bali with only three friends , " one said . " I 'm getting married in the garden with just a little dinner . What should I wear ? " ? " Alber , I 'm no longer a size 0 , " fretted another . " What should I wear ? " ' ' ' It 's my eighth husband , and my name is not Liz Taylor . What should I wear ? " Elbaz now says , " So I thought , Yes , I 'm going to think about this . " He did his thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and dreamed up modern-day wedding attire ( including unorthodox caftans , suits , and short dresses , all off-the-rack ) under the name Collection Blanche . He even designed an engagement ring with a pearl on one side and a diamond on the other for Van Cleef &; Arpels . So far , Elbaz has created 16 wedding dresses for special women around the world ( including Demi Moore ) . " All of them are still married , " he proudly reports , " so I love the idea . " He has also created a line of chic travel essentials , T-shirts , and pajamas called 22 Faubourg . Brilliantly , the travel items are in navy , black , and cream ( so you wo n't clash ) and are cut square , not unlike a kimono ( so you ca n't goof up when packing ) . The new lines , both available later this fall , are not stepchildren farmed out to a licensee but part of Lanvin 's exclusive mother ship . " I do n't believe in bridge or secondary lines . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says definitively . " I hate bridges . I 'm always very insecure on bridges . " Elbaz 's whimsical sketches cover T-shirts and a wheelie suitcase . " It 's a little bit silly , " he admits , " but why not ? I do n't have to report to bankers . I have to report to women . " That means all women . " It works on my 20-year-old daughter and for someone my age , " says Getty , 40 . " Any girl can wear Lanvin . That 's the magic of it . " The only real prohibition to wearing Lanvin is one 's bank account , which the designer sympathizes with . " I am not coming from a rich family , " he remarks . " I was not in boarding school in Switzerland , and my mother did not wear Balenciaga when she was young . I am coming from the edge of the edge of the middle , so I understand what it is . I remember my time there as well . And I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : An ethereal creation from Elbaz 's debut bridal collection .

Born in Morocco and raised in Tel Aviv by a hairdresser father and an aspiring-artist mother , Elbaz spent his youth sketching . ( At age 11 , he presented his teacher with a notebook filled with sketches of every outfit she 'd worn over the previous year . ) He did service in the Israeli army before heading to Shenkar College of Engineering and Design near Tel Aviv . Though he dutifully climbed fashion 's ladder and reigns on top at Lanvin , he never took to living large . " I do n't hang out in a certain hotel or certain restaurant , " he says . " I like pizza . I like McDonald 's . That 's me . And I 'm not doing clothes because I want a certain elite group of people to wear them . " Elbaz makes clothes because he is devoted to coaxing fashion 's cranky wheels toward the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he takes a break , the result is unfortunate . " I went to Tuscany to do five days in a spa , and the first day I had this thing that only old or fat people get , " he says of a recent failed vacation . " Your back gets totally blocked . I could n't move for five days . " He quickly returned to his office in Paris . " The moment I came back , I felt better , so it 's my remedy , " he concludes . His work ethic is an aberration today , when anyone on the cover of Us Weekly can be a " designer . " " Celebrities out there think that they can design , " he says , astonished at the absurdity . " What if I were to say I 'm going to be a ballerina ? I ca n't be a ballerina . I ca n't jump ; I ca n't do a pirouette . There are certain things that I can not do . " And there are certain things  --  like making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 yards of itchy tulle  --  that he alone can do . " He 's one of the most powerful creative-design talents we have in the world of fashion , " says Gilhart definitively . Take a look at the racks of your local retailer , where exposed back zippers , frayed-silk hems , and crushed bows cover other labels ' merchandise , and you will see the pure breadth of Elbaz 's influence at work . For fall , he carved a new lightning-bolt path with dramatic wide sleeves , inspired by Jeanne Lanvin 's work in the 1930s , that are sure to send copyists into overdrive . The collection was a huge hit , but after the show Elbaz was in bed with a temperature . " I always think it 's horrible , " he says . Elbaz 's humility is in part the result of a long road that included years of anonymity at Guy Laroche and Geoffrey Beene and a not-so-friendly limelight at Yves Saint Laurent . " I think it took many people some time to understand my work , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nice , cute , and commercial . " Though he has hit an exceptional stride at Lanvin at age 46 , this fact has failed to hit him . " I 'm doing okay , just okay , " he says . What of the gushing critical praise ? " I think maybe now they love me , but tomorrow they will not anymore . " He is acutely aware of the time " when you 're not Alber from Lanvin , but you are just Alber . " So he plods ahead in a serious-minded way . Even after a fashion show , he never feels like partying . " I feel like a woman in labor , " he explains , again putting himself in a female frame of mind . " After you have a baby , do you want to go to a nightclub ? " A lot of designers do , and many show off as much skin and get as much newspaper ink as a freshly minted starlet . Elbaz would n't dream of disrobing . He prefers suits . ( " I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) He never wears shorts or even T-shirts ( " not even at the beach " ) . He spends little time on his appearance , but he 's " worrying all the time " about it . He does n't have an entourage ( " but if people want an entourage , it 's okay , because it protects you " ) . He does n't throw hysterics with Lanvin 's owner , Mrs. Shaw-Lan Wang . ( In fact , he likes her so much , he even included her likeness in his sketch print for 22 Faubourg . ) He hates big dinners , no matter how glam . " When you sit at a big dinner , you end up talking about the weather . When you sit with one person , you might laugh ; you might cry . This is how I meet people . I do n't need bodies . I work on bodies all day long . I need people . " Elbaz does n't mind hanging out on the sidelines , which , aptly , is where he wants his dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it whispers , " he explains , raising an index finger in emphasis . " And when you whisper , it takes more time , but it goes deeper . There is something very selfish about designers being loud , because the only thing you show is how much talent you have . Women disappear in those pieces . And my job is to make you look good , not the dress look good .
