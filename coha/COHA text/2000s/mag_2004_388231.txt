Official transcripts reveal ... <p> This year 's flu season brought consumers a double dose of trouble . First , as is well-known to most , there was not enough vaccine made to be given to all who wanted it at the start of this year 's apparently harsh flu season . By December 5 , many health care providers were starting to turn shot seekers away , and the manufacturers said that all the vaccine they had made had already been shipped . Second , the vaccine made for the 2003-2004 flu season was not as close a match to the predominant flu virus currently circulating as the government 's scientific advisors had wanted it to be  --  meaning that the vaccine might offer less protection for this season than in seasons past . <p> These stories have been reported  --  and , indeed , spun  --  in a number of different ways . Most notably , the Centers for Disease Control has insisted that the silver lining of the vaccine shortage is that many more people sought the vaccine than had done so in previous years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus has been characterized as a technical or scientific problem that could not be overcome in time to respond to late information about a new virus variant circulating . <p> A closer examination of what was actually said by the government 's vaccine advisors paints a slightly different picture , however . In February and March of 2003 , the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee met , as it does every year , to discuss what flu vaccine formulation to recommend to the Food and Drug Administration . The transcripts of those meetings reveal an advisory committee that was indeed facing some technical hurdles as it considered the possibility of switching to a new vaccine formulation . But the transcripts also show a committee repeatedly deliberating the option of pursuing multiple development strategies in order to reduce the risk that any one formulation would not work out . Instead they were told by industry and government representatives that multiple development strategies were not possible . Because of limited manufacturing capacity , the committee had to make " one best choice " of vaccine formulation . Eventually , the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulation that had been used for several years , even though the committee believed it was not the best vaccine possible . <p> The story does n't end there . While the manufacturers met their goal of making 83 million doses of the flu vaccine , they fell short of making a quantity sufficient to supply everyone who sought vaccination . Authorities are candid in their assessment that the extra demand for flu vaccine this season was induced by fears of an especially harsh flu season that seemed to be developing as a result of the early arrival and rapid spread of the new virus variant . <p> That development could have been anticipated . Any virus strain containing a significant genetic mutation , as this year 's predominant flu bug does , will face much less natural immunity , allowing it to spread rapidly . Furthermore , authorities knew that this year 's virus , though a new variant , is still of a type that occasionally arrives early . Both public health officials and the manufacturers knew the new variant was likely to be the predominant bug , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcripts that show much concern for respecting a manufacturing timeline , show no mention of anticipating a need for more vaccine . The manufacturers made 83 million doses this year , because that 's what was used last year . As if a shortage was n't enough for consumers to worry about , the FDA ended up having to investigate allegations of illegitimate sellers trying to fill the supply void with unsafe vaccine . Why ' One Best ' ? <p> The source of these consumer problems is in significant part the inherent technical difficulty of producing a new vaccine strain . The VRBPAC transcripts show , however , that those technical difficulties can be aggravated by the fact that there is not enough manufacturing capacity for the simultaneous development of back-up options . That reality forces a choice of one vaccine formulation before it can be known what the best choice really is . ( See " Finding ' One Best ' Vaccine , " beginning at page 12 . ) <p> But decisions by manufacturers do not occur in a regulatory vacuum . In particular , the transcripts suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee recommends and the FDA approves a flu vaccine , that induces manufacturing limits . The process produces an expectation that there will be only one vaccine formulation approved . As one representative of Aventis-Pasteur put it during the committee 's deliberations : " Today , and over the next couple of weeks , people are going to make the best possible choice . Once this group has articulated the best choice , why would any company want to go with what 's not the best choice ? " <p> While that arrangement might work well enough in most years , it can leave the country vulnerable in years when a so-called " herald wave " virus develops . A " herald wave " virus is one that contains a more significant genetic mutation than typically occurs . Such a virus faces little natural immunity and can spread quickly , thus becoming the dominant virus . The virus ' mutations also give it greater resistance to current vaccines . <p> A " herald wave " indicates the need for a new vaccine component , but recommending a new strain introduces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowing how easily a new component can be made before manufacturing begins . If a particular strain of vaccine turns out to be slow-growing , the manufacturers might not be able to make enough vaccine . Second , there is no way of knowing how effective a new vaccine strain is before it is made . Another risk , whatever the strain chosen , is that the committee will guess wrong about which virus variants will circulate when the flu season arrives and the vaccine has already been made . <p> For all of these reasons , a strategy of parallel production might be desirable , especially when a " herald wave " emerges . Yet , the regulatory division of labor , in which the government leads and industry follows , forces the committee to make a choice before any manufacturing can begin . On top of all that , it can take up to six months to produce the flu vaccine once the vaccine strains are selected . As a result , the government 's vaccine advisors face a " go/no go " decision on changing a vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull back from a wrong choice . Riding on that choice is the country 's opportunity to reduce the 35,000 flu fatalities that typically occur every year . What About Next Time ? <p> Unlike vaccination for other diseases , vaccination against the flu is an annual affair because flu viruses mutate frequently , making any immunity short-lived . ( Federal recommendations on flu vaccines warn health-care providers against giving the vaccine too soon to older people , because the immunity might wear off before it 's needed . ) The Food and Drug Administration approves a specific flu vaccine formulation for each flu season . The flu vaccine actually contains three doses . This trivalent vaccine offers greater protection than a single dose because it can combat a broader range of flu viruses . <p> Every year , the FDA 's advisory committee , the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee , considers whether any of the components of the formulation should be changed in order to provide greater immunity against a new virus variant . The committee assesses a variety of information and data gathered from health agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A major component of this information is a briefing by the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta . In some years , the virus mutates more significantly than others . The committee is most concerned about the possibility of what is called a " herald wave " phenomenon . A " herald wave " occurs when a virus develops a significant mutation in its DNA and thus faces little natural immunity . Such a virus can spread rapidly and quickly become the dominant virus . <p> In February of 2003 , the VRBPAC did correctly anticipate that a new virus variant with a significant mutation would become dominant in the fall . The committee also identified a candidate vaccine strain , called Fujian , to replace the previously used strain , called Panama . Ultimately , Fujian did not even make it into the manufacturing phase . Pre-production problems tipped the committee toward the choice of sticking with Panama . <p> Fortunately , Panama though not ideal , is expected to provide some protection to those who received it , though there will be no way of knowing how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fujian will be included as one of the components for the next flu season 's vaccine . In fact , it is already being produced for the southern hemi-sphere flu season . <p> But what happens when the next " herald wave " virus comes and a new component must be developed quickly ? Is the " one best vaccine " arrangement a train wreck waiting to happen ? Or what if public health authorities simply guess wrong about which virus strains will be circulating ? Or if the planned vaccine provides less protection than anticipated ? These problems have occurred before , yet we still have a system that makes little allowance for error or unanticipated need . <p> Some have attributed the vaccine shortage to a miscalculation by the manufacturers . During a press briefing , the Director of the Centers for Disease Control , Dr. Julie Gerberding , said : " That 's one of the consequences of having vaccine manufacturing occur this way , in the private sector . " In a sense she is right . Leaving the decision about how much to produce to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities only invites a problem with coordinating priorities . A number of solutions have been suggested , including guaranteeing government purchase of a certain number of excess doses or government funding of an emergency stockpile . <p> This view addresses only part of the problem . It also misses the role of the " one best vaccine " approach in skewing incentives . That complicity is easy to miss . After all , no company wants to produce more than it can sell , nor does it want to produce other than the ideal product  --  no matter the product or the type of market arrangement . <p> But when a market is coordinated by a process of government recommendation and approval , then manufacturers face very different incentives . When each producer expects all his competitors to pursue the same path to the market , there is no competition for variety . <p> With only one vaccine formulation expected , there is little possibility of misjudging the vaccine " market . " Even if the government gets the choice wrong , a manufacturer faces no loss because no other manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the demand for a bad vaccine may end up being greater than that for a good vaccine . A good vaccine protects not only a person who gets vaccinated , but also those with whom a vaccinated person comes into contact . Obviously , the better the vaccine , the greater the community benefit involved in any one vaccination . Conversely , the worse the vaccine , the lower the community benefit and the greater is the risk faced by those who might not normally bother with vaccination . As this year 's flu season demonstrates , the perception of a greater risk can induce a greater demand for a flu vaccine , whatever its imperfections . <p> By contrast , in a true market situation , the best product is yet to be discovered through experience and consumer choice . The possibility that consumers might buy another product induces brand competition . Producers compete to make the best product , and when different brands are truly different , then competition may allow price differences . <p> When the product is standardized by government fiat , then only price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of production ( which means minimizing capacity ) . <p> Even vaccine makers acknowledge off the record that there is no such thing as brand competition for flu vaccine . There is only price competition , and it has been so intense that a number of vaccine makers have left the market in recent years . Today , there are only two . <p> The proposal for a guaranteed buy as a solution to flu vaccine shortages may in fact intensify the overall problem : Why should any company facing a government-defined market worry about whether it is producing the wrong kind of vaccine ? <p> It is sort of an orthodoxy to say that government must decide the important things because markets ca n't be trusted to produce the public good . Among those who accept this view , proposals to inject market incentives into areas related to health and safety are regarded as irresponsible exercises in free-market ideology . <p> In the case of flu vaccine , the facts suggest otherwise . Obviously , governments must conduct disease surveillance activities and provide that information to the manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flu vaccine strains may also be a good thing . <p> But the absence of variety in flu vaccines is neither good nor a product of a free-market arrangement . It is a coordination effect that arises only because of the presumption that there is one best vaccine that can be known by the government prior to any manufacturing . That presumption limits manufacturing capacity , which in turn limits what the government 's advisors may recommend . The public-health dog is getting wagged by the bureaucratic tail . <p> If the country wants to reduce the risk that a future flu season will yield a public health catastrophe , it may have to consider something really radical-like letting markets decide which flu vaccine formulations are the best . In the area of public health and safety , why would n't we want to err on the side of having too many options ? <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Alex Adrianson <p> <p> Alex Adrianson is Editor of Consumers ' Research . <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
