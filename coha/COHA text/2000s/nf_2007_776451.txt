Called Home // This story about good food begins in a quick-stop convenience market . It was our family 's last day in Arizona , where I 'd lived half my life and raised two kids for the whole of theirs . Now we were moving away forever , taking our nostalgic inventory of the things we would never see again : the bush where the roadrunner built a nest and fed lizards to her weird-looking babies ; the tree Camille crashed into learning to ride a bike ; the exact spot where Lily touched a dead snake . Our driveway was just the first tributary on a memory river sweeping us out . // One person 's picture postcard is someone else 's normal . This was the landscape whose every face we knew : giant saguaro cacti , coyotes , mountains , the wicked sun reflecting off bare gravel . We were leaving it now in one of its uglier moments , which made good-bye easier , but also seemed like a cheap shot-like ending a romance right when your partner has really bad bed hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prickly heat caught in a long , naked wince. // This was the end of May . Our rainfall since Thanksgiving had measured less than one inch . The cacti , denizens of deprivation , looked ready to pull up roots and hitch a ride out if they could . The prickly pears waved good-bye with puckered , grayish pads . The tall , dehydrated saguaros stood around all teetery and sucked-in like very prickly supermodels . Even in the best of times desert creatures live on the edge of survival , getting by mostly on vapor and their own life savings . Now , as the southern tier of U.S. states came into a third consecutive year of drought , people elsewhere debated how seriously they should take global warming . We were staring it in the face . // Away went our little family , like rats leaping off the burning ship . It hurt to think about everything at once : our friends , our desert , old home , new home . We felt giddy and tragic as we pulled up at a little gas-and-go market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to seek our fortunes we had to gas up , of course , and buy snacks for the road . We did have a cooler in the back seat packed with respectable lunch fare . But we had more than two thousand miles to go . Before we crossed a few state lines we 'd need to give our car a salt treatment and indulge in some things that go crunch . // This was the trip of our lives . We were ending our existence outside the city limits of Tucson , Arizona , to begin a rural one in southern Appalachia . We 'd sold our house and stuffed the car with the most crucial things : birth certificates , books-on-tape , and a dog on drugs . ( Just for the trip , I swear . ) All other stuff would come in the moving van . For better or worse , we would soon be living on a farm . // For twenty years Steven had owned a piece of land in the southern Appalachians with a farmhouse , barn , orchards and fields , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was living there when I met him , teaching college and fixing up his old house one salvaged window at a time . I 'd come as a visiting writer , recently divorced , with something of a fixer-upper life . We proceeded to wreck our agendas in the predictable fashion by falling in love . My young daughter and I were attached to our community in Tucson ; Steven was just as attached to his own green pastures and the birdsong chorus of deciduous eastern woodlands . My father-in-law to be , upon hearing the exciting news about us , asked Steven , " Could n't you find one closer ? " // Apparently not . We held on to the farm by renting the farmhouse to another family , and maintained marital happiness by migrating like birds : for the school year we lived in Tucson , but every summer headed back to our rich foraging grounds , the farm . For three months a year we lived in a tiny , extremely crooked log cabin in the woods behind the farmhouse , listening to wood thrushes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child came along shortly ) loved playing in the creek , catching turtles , experiencing real mud . I liked working the land , and increasingly came to think of this place as my home too . When all of us were ready , we decided , we 'd go there for keeps . // We had many conventional reasons for relocation , including extended family . My Kingsolver ancestors came from that county in Virginia ; I 'd grown up only a few hours away , over the Kentucky line . Returning now would allow my kids more than just a hit-and-run , holiday acquaintance with grandparents and cousins . In my adult life I 'd hardly shared a phone book with anyone else using my last name . Now I could spend Memorial Day decorating my ancestors ' graves with peonies from my backyard . Tucson had opened my eyes to the world and given me a writing career , legions of friends , and a taste for the sensory extravagance of red hot chiles and five-alarm sunsets . But after twenty-five years in the desert , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move felt right to us , and it 's the purview of this book . We wanted to live in a place that could feed us : where rain falls , crops grow , and drinking water bubbles right up out of the ground . This might seem an abstract reason for leaving beloved friends and one of the most idyllic destination cities in the United States . But it was real to us . As it closes in on the million-souls mark , Tucson 's charms have made it one of this country 's fastest-growing cities . It keeps its people serviced across the wide , wide spectrum of daily human wants , with its banks , shops , symphonies , colleges , art galleries , city parks , and more golf courses than you can shake a stick at . By all accounts ... //
