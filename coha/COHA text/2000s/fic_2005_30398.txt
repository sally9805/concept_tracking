Eleven on Top By Evanovich , Janet St. Martin 's Paperbacks Evanovich , Janet My name is Stephanie Plum . When I was eighteen I got a job working a hot dog stand on the boardwalk on the Jersey shore . I worked the last shift at Dave 's Dogs , and I was supposed to start shutting down a half hour before closing so I could clean up for the day crew . We did chili dogs , cheese dogs , kraut dogs , and bean-topped barking dogs . We grilled them on a big grill with rotating rods . Round and round the rods went all day long , turning the dogs . Dave Loogie owned the dog stand and came by every night to lock the stand down . He checked the garbage to make sure nothing good was thrown away , and he counted the dogs that were left on the grill . " You got ta plan ahead , " Dave told me every night . " You got more than five dogs left on the grill when we close , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tits . " So every night , fifteen minutes before closing , before Dave showed up , I ate hot dogs . Not a good way to go when you 're working at the shore nights and on the beach in a skimpy bathing suit by day . One night I ate fourteen hot dogs . Okay , maybe it was only nine , but it felt like fourteen . Anyway , it was too many hot dogs . Well hell , I needed the job . For years Dave 's Dogs took the number-one slot on my list of all-time crappy jobs held . This morning , I decided mypresent position had finally won the honor of replacing Dave 's Dogs . I 'm a bounty hunter . A bond enforcement agent , if you want to make me sound more legitimate . I work for my cousin Vinnie in his bail bonds office in the Chambersburg section of Trenton . At least I used to work for my cousin Vinnie . Thirty seconds ago , I quit . I handed in the phony badge I bought off the Net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my remaining open files on Connie 's desk . Vinnie writes the bonds . Connie shuffles the paperwork . My sidekick , Lula , files when the mood strikes her . And an incredibly sexy , incredibly handsome badass named Ranger and I hunt down the morons who do n't show up for trial . Until today . As of thirty seconds ago , all the morons got transferred to Ranger 's list . " Give me a break , " Connie said . " You ca n't quit . I 've got a stack of open files . " " Give them to Ranger . " " Ranger does n't do the low bonds . He only takes the high-risk cases . " " Give them to Lula . " Lula was standing hand on hip , watching me spar with Connie . Lula 's a size-sixteen black woman squashed into size-ten leopard print spandex . And the weird thing is , in her own way , Lula looks pretty good in the animal spandex . " Hell yeah , " Lula said . " I could catch them sonsabitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na miss you , " she said to me . " What are you gon na do if you do n't work here ? And what brought this on ? " " Look at me ! " I said . " What do you see ? " " I see a mess , " Lula said . " You should take better care of yourself . " " I went after Sam Sporky this morning . " " Melon-head Sporky ? " " Yeah . Melon-head . I chased him through three yards . A dog tore a hole in my jeans . Some crazy old lady shot at me . And I finally tackled Sporky behind the Tip Top Cafe . " " Looks like it was garbage day , " Lula said . " You do n't smell too good . And you got something looks like mustard all over your ass . Least I hope that 's mustard . " " There were a bunch of garbage bags at the curb and Melon-head rolled me into them . We made sort of a mess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spit on me ! " " I imagine that 's the glob of something stuck in your hair ? " " No . He spit on my shoe . Is there something in my hair ? " Lula gave an involuntary shiver . " Sounds like a normal day , " Connie said . " Hard to believe you 're quitting because of Melon-head . " Truth is , I do n't exactly know why I was quitting . My stomach feels icky when I get up in the morning . And I go to bed at night wondering where my life is heading . I 've been working as a bounty hunter for a while now and I 'm not the world 's best . I barely make enough money to cover my rent each month . I 've been stalked by crazed killers , taunted by naked fat men , firebombed , shot at , spat at , cussed at , chased by humping dogs , attacked by a flock of Canadian honkers , rolled in garbage , and my cars get destroyed at an alarming rate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the icky feeling in my stomach . They 're both Mr. Right . And they 're both Mr. Wrong . They 're both a little scary . I was n't sure if I wanted a relationship with either of them . And I had n't a clue how to choose between them . One wanted to marry me , sometimes . His name was Joe Morelli and he was a Trenton cop . Ranger was the other guy , and I was n't sure what he wanted to do with me beyond get me naked and put a smile on my face . Plus , there was the note that got slipped under my door two days ago . i 'm back . What the heck did that mean ? And the follow-up note tacked to my windshield. did you think i was dead ? My life is too weird . It 's time for a change . Time to get a more sensible job and sort out my future . Connie and Lula shifted their attention from me to the front door . The bonds office is located on Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cluttered storage area in the back , behind a bank of file cabinets . I did n't hear the door open . And I did n't hear footsteps . So either Connie and Lula were hallucinating or else Ranger was in the room . Ranger is the mystery man . He 's a half head taller than me , moves like a cat , kicks ass all day long , only wears black , smells warm and sexy , and is 100 percent pure perfectly toned muscle . He gets his dark complexion and liquid brown eyes from Cuban ancestors . He was Special Forces , and that 's about all anyone knows about Ranger . Well hell , when you smell that good and look that good , who cares about anything else , anyway ? I can usually feel Ranger standing behind me . Ranger does n't ordinarily leave any space between us . Today , Ranger was keeping his distance . He reached around me and dropped a file and a body receipt on Connie 's desk . " I brought Angel Robbie in last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check to RangeMan . " RangeMan is Ranger 's company . It 's located in an office building in center city and specializes in security systems and fugitive apprehension . " I got big news , " Lula said to Ranger . " I 've been promoted to bounty hunter on account of Stephanie just quit . " Ranger picked a couple strands of sauerkraut off my shirt and pitched them into Connie 's wastebasket . " Is that true ? " " Yes , " I said . " I quit . I 'm done fighting crime . I 've rolled in garbage for the last time . " " Hard to believe , " Ranger said . " I 'm thinking of getting a job at the button factory , " I told him . " I hear they 're hiring . " " I do n't have a lot of domestic instincts , " Ranger said to me , his attention fixing on the unidentifiable glob of goo in my hair , " but I have a real strong urge to take you home and hose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her lower lip , and Lula fanned herself with a file . " I appreciate the offer , " I told him . " Maybe some other time . " " Babe , " Ranger said on a smile . He nodded to Lula and Connie and left the office . No one said anything until he drove off in his shiny black Porsche Turbo . " I think I wet my pants , " Lula said . " Was that one of them double entendres ? " I drove back to my apartment , took a shower all by myself , and got dressed up in a stretchy white tank top and a tailored black suit with a short skirt . I stepped into four-inch black heels , fluffed up my almost shoulder-length curly brown hair , and added one last layer to my mascara and lipstick . I 'd taken a couple minutes to print out a rsum on my computer . It was pathetically short . Graduated with mediocre grades from Douglass College . Worked as a lingerie buyer for a cheap department store for a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cousin Vinnie . Seeking management position in a classy company . Of course , this was Jersey and classy here might not be the national standard . I grabbed my big black leather shoulder bag and yelled good-bye to my roomie , Rex-the-hamster . Rex lives in a glass aquarium on the kitchen counter . Rex is pretty much nocturnal so we 're sort of like ships passing in the night . As an extra treat , once in a while I drop a Cheez Doodle into his cage and he emerges from his soup can home to retrieve the Doodle . That 's about as complicated as our relationship gets . I live on the second floor of a blocky , no-frills , three-story apartment building . My apartment looks out over the parking lot , which is fine by me . Most of the residents in my building are seniors . They 're home in front of their televisions before the sun goes down , so the lot side is quiet at night . I exited my apartment and locked up behind myself . I took the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass doors , and crossed the lot to my car . I was driving a dark green Saturn SL2 . The Saturn had been the special of the day at Generous George 's Used Car Emporium . I 'd actually wanted a Lexus SC 430 , but Generous George thought the Saturn was more in line with my budget constraints . I slid behind the wheel and cranked the engine over . I was heading off to apply for a job at the button factory and I was feeling down about it . I was telling myself it was a new beginning , but truth is , it felt more like a sad ending . I turned onto Hamilton and drove a couple blocks to Tasty Pastry Bakery , thinking a doughnut would be just the thing to brighten my mood . Five minutes later , I was on the sidewalk in front of the bakery , doughnut bag in hand , and I was face-to-face with Morelli . He was wearing jeans and scuffed boots and a black V-neck sweater over a black T-shirt . Morelli is six feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Jersey guy smart , and he 's not a man you 'd want to annoy . . . unless you 're me . I 've been annoying Morelli all my life . " I was driving by and saw you go in , " Morelli said . He was standing close , smiling down at me , eyeing the bakery bag . " Boston creams ? " he asked , already knowing the answer . " I needed happy food . " " You should have called me , " he said , hooking his finger into the neckline of my white tank , pulling the neck out to take a look inside . " I have just the thing to make you happy . " I 've cohabitated with Morelli from time to time and I knew this to be true . " I have stuff to do this afternoon and doughnuts take less time . " " Cupcake , I have n't seen you in weeks . I could set a new land speed record for getting happy . " " Yeah , but that would be your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing the doughnuts with Morelli . " What about mine ? " " Your happiness would be top priority . " I took a bite of doughnut . " Tempting , but no . I have a job interview at the button factory . I 'm done with bond enforcement . " " When did this happen ? " " About an hour ago , " I said . " Okay , I do n't actually have an interview appointment , but Karen Slobodsky works in the personnel office , and she said I should look her up if I ever wanted a job . " " I could give you a job , " Morelli said . " The pay would n't be great but the benefits would be pretty decent . " " Gee , " I said , " that 's the second scariest offer I 've had today . " " And the scariest offer would be ? " I did n't think it was smart to tell Morelli about Ranger 's offer of a hosing down . Morelli was wearing a gun on his hip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seemed like a bad idea to say something that might ratchet up the competition between them . I leaned into Morelli and kissed him lightly on the mouth . " It 's too scary to share , " I told him . He felt nice against me , and he tasted like doughnut . I ran the tip of my tongue along his lower lip . " Yum , " I said . Morelli 's fingers curled into the back of my jacket . " Yum is a little mild for what I 'm feeling . And what I 'm feeling should n't be happening on the sidewalk in front of the bakery . Maybe we could get together tonight . " " For pizza ? " " Yeah , that too . " I 'd been taking a time-out from Morelli and Ranger , hoping to get a better grip on my feelings , but I was n't making much progress . It was like choosing between birthday cake and a big-boy margarita . How could I possibly decide ? And probably I 'd be better off without either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Okay , " I said . " I 'll meet you at Pino 's . " " I was thinking my house . The Mets are playing and Bob misses you . " Bob is Morelli 's dog . Bob is a big , orange , incredibly huggable shaggy-haired monster with an eating disorder . Bob eats everything . " No fair , " I said . " You 're using Bob to lure me to your house . " " Yeah , " Morelli said . " So ? " I blew out a sigh . " I 'll be over around six . " I drove a couple blocks down Hamilton and left-turned onto Olden . The button factory is just beyond the city limits of north Trenton . At four in the morning , it 's a ten-minute drive from my apartment . At all other hours , the drive time is unpredictable . I stopped for a red light at the corner of Olden and State and just as the light flashed green I heard the pop of gunshot behind me and the zing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiberglass . I was pretty sure it was my metal and fiberglass , so I floored the Saturn and sailed across the intersection . I crossed North Clinton and kept going , checking my rearview mirror . Hard to tell in traffic , but I did n't think anyone was following me . My heart was racing , and I was telling myself to chill . No reason to believe this was anything more than a random shooting . Probably just some gang guy having fun , practicing his sniping . You 've got to practice somewhere , right ? I fished my cell phone out of my purse and called Morelli . " Someone 's taking potshots at cars on the corner of Olden and State , " I told him . " You might want to send someone over to check things out . " " Are you okay ? " " I 'd be better if I had that second doughnut . " Okay , so this was my best try at bravado . My hands were white- knuckled gripping the wheel and my foot was shaking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told myself I was just a little excited . Not panicked . Not terrified . Just a little excited . All I had to do was calm down and take a couple more deep breaths and I 'd be fine . Ten minutes later , I pulled the Saturn into the button factory parking lot . The entire factory was housed in a mammoth three-story redbrick building . The bricks were dark with age , the old-fashioned double-hung windows were grimy , and the landscaping was lunar . Dickens would have loved it . I was n't so sure it was my thing . But then , my thing was n't clearly defined anymore . I got out and walked to the rear of the car , hoping I 'd been wrong about the gunshot . I felt another dump of adrenaline when I saw the damage . I 'd taken three hits . Two rounds were embedded in the back panel and one had destroyed a rear light . No one had followed me into the lot , and I did n't see any cars lingering on the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I would have believed it entirely if it had n't been for my lousy previous job and the two notes . As it was , I had to back-burner some paranoia so as not to be in a terror-induced cold sweat while trying to talk some guy into hiring me . I crossed the lot to the large glass double doors leading to the offices , and I sashayed through the doors into the lobby . The lobby was small with a chipped tile floor and seasick green walls . Somewhere , not far off , I could hear machines stamping out buttons . Phones rang in another part of the building . I approached the reception desk and asked for Karen Slobodsky . " Sorry , " the woman said . " You 're two hours too late . She just quit . Stormed out of here like hurricane Slobodsky , yelling something about sexual harassment . " " So there 's a job opening ? " I asked , thinking my day was finally turning lucky . " Sure looks that way . I 'll buzz her boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Alizzi 's office , sitting across from him . He was at his desk and his slight frame was dwarfed by his massive furniture . He looked to be in his late thirties to early forties . He had slicked-back black hair and an accent and skin tone that had me thinking Indian . " I will tell you now that I am not Indian , " Alizzi said . " Everyone thinks I am Indian , but that is a false assumption . I come from a very small island country off the coast of India . " " Sri Lanka ? " " No , no , no , " he said , wagging his bony finger at me . " Not Sri Lanka . My country is even smaller . We are a very proud people , so you must be careful not to make ethnic slurs . " " Sure . You want to tell me the name of this country ? " " Latorran . " " Never heard of it . " " You see , already you are treading in very dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you were a bounty hunter , " he said , skimming over my rsum , eyebrows raised . " That is a quite exciting job . Why would you want to quit such a job ? " " I 'm looking for something that has more potential for advancement . " " Oh dear , that would be my job you would eventually be seeking . " " Yes , well I 'm sure it would take years , and then who knows . . . you might be president of the company by then . " " You are an outrageous flatterer , " he said . " I like that . And what would you do if I were to ask you for sexual favors ? Would you threaten to sue me ? " " No . I guess I 'd ignore you . Unless you got physical . Then I 'd have to kick you in a place that hurt a lot and you probably would n't be able to father any children . " " That sounds fair , " he said . " It happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're hired . You can start tomorrow , promptly at eight o'clock . Do not be late . " Wonderful . I have a real job in a nice clean office where no one will shoot at me . I should be happy , yes ? This was what I wanted , was n't it ? Then why do I feel so depressed ? I dragged myself down the stairs to the lobby and out to the parking lot . I found my car and the depression deepened . I hated my car . Not that it was a bad car . It just was n't the right car . Not to mention , it would be great to have a car that did n't have three bullet holes in it . Maybe I needed another doughnut . A half hour later , I was back in my apartment . I 'd stopped in at Tasty Pastry and left with a day-old birthday cake . The cake said Happy Birthday Larry . I do n't know how Larry celebrated his birthday , but apparently it was without cake . Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get happy , birthday cake is the way to go . This was a yellow cake with thick , disgusting white frosting made with lard and artificial butter and artificial vanilla and a truckload of sugar . It was decorated with big gunky roses made out of pink and yellow and purple frosting . It was three layers thick with lemon cream between the layers . And it was designed to serve eight people , so it was just the right size . I dropped my clothes on the floor and dug into the cake . I gave a chunk of cake to Rex , and I worked on the rest . I ate all the pieces with the big pink roses . I was starting to feel nauseous , but I pressed on . I ate all the pieces with the big yellow roses . I had a purple rose and a couple roseless pieces left . I could n't do it . I could n't eat any more cake . I staggered into my bedroom . I needed a nap . I dropped a T-shirt over my head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . God , do n't you love clothes with elastic ? I had one knee on the bed when I saw the note pinned to my pillowcase . be afraid . be very afraid . next time i 'll aim higher . I thought I 'd be more afraid if I had n't just eaten five pieces of birthday cake . As it was , I was mostly afraid of throwing up . I looked under the bed , behind the shower curtain , and in all the closets . No knuckle-dragging monsters anywhere . I slid the bolt home on the front door and shuffled back to the bedroom . Now , here 's the thing . This is n't the first time someone 's broken into my apartment . In fact , people regularly break in . Ranger slides in like smoke . Morelli has a key . And various bad guys and psychos have managed to breach the three locks I keep on the door . Some have even left threatening messages . So I was n't as freaked out as I might have been prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more toward numb despair . I wanted all the scary things to go away . I was tired of scary . I 'd quit my scary job , and now I wanted the scary people out of my life . I did n't want to be kidnapped ever again . I did n't want to be held at knifepoint or gunpoint . I did n't want to be threatened , stalked , or run off the road by a homicidal maniac . I crawled under the covers and pulled the quilt over my head . I was almost asleep when the quilt was yanked back . I let out a shriek and stared up at Ranger . " What the heck are you doing ? " I yelled at him , grabbing at the quilt . " Visiting , Babe . " " Did you ever think about ringing a doorbell ? " Ranger smiled down at me . " That would take all the fun out of it . " " I did n't know you were interested in fun . " He sat on the side of the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat , " Ranger said . " You smell like a party . " " It 's birthday cake breath . And are we looking at another double entendre ? " " Yeah , " Ranger said , " but it 's not going anywhere . I have to get back to work . Tank 's waiting for me with the motor running . I just wanted to find out if you 're serious about quitting . " " I got a job at the button factory . I start tomorrow . " He reached across and removed the note from the pillowcase next to me . " New boyfriend ? " " Someone broke in while I was out . And I guess he shot at me this afternoon . " Ranger stood . " You should discourage people from doing that . Do you need help ? " " Not yet . " " Babe , " Ranger said . And he left . I listened carefully , but I did n't hear the front door open or close . I got up and tiptoed through the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bolt was in place . I suppose he could have gone out the living room window , but he would have had to climb down the side of the building like Spider-Man . The phone rang , and I waited to see the number pop up on my caller ID . It was Lula . " Yo , " I said . " Yo , your ass . You got some nerve sticking me with this job . " " You volunteered . " " I must 've had sunstroke . A person has to be nuts to want this job . " " Something go wrong ? " " Hell , yes . Everything 's wrong . I could use some assistance here . I 'm trying to snag Willie Martin , and he 's not cooperating . " " How uncooperative is he ? " " He hauled his nasty ass out of his apartment and left me handcuffed to his big stupid bed . " " That 's pretty uncooperative . " " Yeah , and it gets worse . I sort of do n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " It 's a little more complicated than that . He was in the shower when I busted in . You ever see Willie Martin naked ? He is fine . He used to play pro ball until he made a mess of his knee and had to turn to boosting cars . " " Un hunh . " " Well , one thing led to another and here I am chained to his hunk-of-junk bed . Hell , it 's not like I get it regular , you know . I 'm real picky about my men . And besides , anybody would 've jumped those bones . He 's got muscles on muscles and a butt you want to sink your teeth into . " The mental image had me considering turning vegetarian . Willie Martin lived in a third-floor loft in a graffiti-riddled warehouse that contained a ground-floor chop shop . It was located on the seven-hundred block of Stark Street , an area of urban decay that rivaled Iraqi bomb sites . I parked behind Lula 's red Firebird and transferred my five-shot Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not much of a gun person and almost never carry one , but I was sufficiently creeped out by the shooting and the notes that I did n't want to venture onto Stark Street unarmed . I locked the car , bypassed the rickety open-cage service elevator on the ground floor , and trudged up two flights of stairs . The stairwell opened to a small grimy foyer and a door with a size-nine high-heeled boot print on it . I guess Willie had n't answered on the first knock and Lula got impatient . I tried the doorknob , and the door swung open . Thank God for small favors because I 'd never had any success at kicking in a door . I tentatively stuck my head in and called " Hello . " " Hello , yourself , " Lula said . " And do n't say no more . I 'm not in a good mood . Just unlock these piece-of-crap handcuffs and stand back because I need fries . I need a whole shitload of fries . I 'm having a fast-food emergency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet , one hand cuffed to the iron headboard of the bed , the other hand holding the sheet together . I pulled the universal handcuff key out of my pocket and looked around the room . " Where are your clothes ? " " He took them . Do you believe that ? Said he was going to teach me a lesson not to go after him . I tell you , you ca n't trust a man . They get what they want and then next thing they got their tighty whities in their pocket and they 're out the door . I do n't know what he was so upset about , anyway . I was just doing my job . He said , ' Was that good for you ? ' And I said , ' Oh yeah , baby , it was real good . ' And then I tried to cuff him . Hell , truth is it was n't all that good , and besides , I 'm a professional bounty hunter now . Bring ' em back dead or alive , with or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cuff him . " " Yeah , well next time put your clothes on before you try to cuff a guy . " Lula unlocked the cuffs and tied a knot in the sheet to hold it closed . " That 's good advice . I 'm gon na remember that . That 's the kind of advice I need to be a first-class bounty hunter . At least he forgot to take my purse . I 'd be really annoyed if he 'd taken my purse . " She went to a chest on the far wall , pulled out one of Willie 's T-shirts and a pair of gym shorts , and put them on . Then she scooped the rest of the clothes out of the chest , carried them to the window , and threw them out . " Okay , " Lula said , " I 'm starting to feel better now . Thanks for coming here to help me . And good news , it looks like no one 's stolen your car . I saw it still sitting at the curb . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suits , shoes , and jackets . All went out the window . " I 'm on a roll now , " she said , looking around the loft . " What else we got that can go out the window ? You think we can fit his big-ass TV out the window ? Hey , how about some kitchen appliances ? Go get me his toaster . " She crossed the room , grabbed a table lamp , and brought it to the window . " Hey ! " she yelled , head out the window , eyes focused on the street . " Get away from that car . Willie , is that you ? What the hell are you doing ? " I ran to the window and looked out . Willie Martin was whaling away at my car with a sledgehammer . " I 'll show you to throw my clothes outta the window , " he said , taking a swing at the right rear quarter panel . " You dumb premature ejaculator , " Lula shouted at him . " You dumb-ass moron ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oops , " Willie said . " Which one 's your car ? " Lula hauled a Glock out of her purse , squeezed off two rounds in Willie 's direction , and Willie left the scene . One of the rounds pinged off my car roof . And the other round made a small hole in my windshield . " Must be something wrong with the sight on this gun , " Lula said to me . " Sorry about that . " I trudged down the stairs and stood on the sidewalk examining my car . Deep scratch in roof from misplaced bullet . Hole in windshield plus embedded bullet in passenger seat . Bashed-in right rear quarter panel and right passenger-side door from sledgehammer . Previous damage from creepy gun attack by insane stalker . And someone had spray painted eat me on the driver 's side door . " Your car 's a mess , " Lula said . " I do n't know what it is with you and cars .
