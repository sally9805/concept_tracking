A few men with knives . Why did n't the passengers , numbering in the dozens , just overpower them ? Of the four hijacked planes , only one failed to reach its terror destination . Why just one ? The question seems unfair , even disrespectful . But its answer illuminates the deepest problem in facing terrorism : failure of the imagination . The passengers ' seeming passivity is reminiscent of the Holocaust . We ask , with trepidation : How could Jews have allowed themselves to be herded into gas chambers by just a few people carrying machine guns ? Because it was inconceivable  --  six decades later it remains inconceivable  --  that the men carrying the weapons would do what they , in fact , did do . The victims were told these were showers . Who could imagine herding children into gas chambers ? In all of human history , no people had ever done that . The victims could not plumb the depths of their enemy 's evil . <P> I suspect the same happened to the doomed passengers on the hijacked planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 years . Almost invariably , everybody ends up O.K. The hijacker wants to go to Cuba , or make a political point , or get the world 's attention . Never in history had hijackers intentionally turned a passenger plane into a flying bomb , killing everyone aboard , including themselves . Decades of experience teach us that if you simply do what the hijackers say , they 'll eventually get tired and give up . That 's the rule . <P> But when the rules do n't apply , when inconceivably cold-blooded evil is in command , the victims are truly helpless . In the face of unfathomable evil , decent people are psychologically disarmed . What is so striking  --  and so alien to civilized sensibilities  --  about the terrorists of radical Islam is their cult of death . Their rhetoric is soaked in the glory of immolation : immolation of the infidel and self-immolation of the avenger . Not since the Nazi rallies of the 1930s has the world witnessed such celebration of blood and soil , of killing and dying . What Western TV would feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lyric " How pleasant is the smell of martyrs ... the land enriched by the blood , the blood pouring out of a fresh body " ? <P> The most chilling detail of the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut is that in his last seconds the suicide bomber was smiling . Bassamat al-farah , it is called . The smile of joy . Suicide bombers are taught that they are guaranteed immediate admission to paradise , where 72 black-eyed virgins await their pleasure . <P> The West has not known such widespread , murderous perversion of religion since the religious wars of the 17th century . Who could have imagined deliberately flying into a building ? The FBI did n't . The FAA did n't . We could hardly believe it as we saw it happening . What hijacked passenger could possibly imagine such a scenario ? <P> Why then did the passengers on the plane that went down near Pittsburgh decide to resist the hijackers and prevent them from completing their mission ? Because they knew : their relatives had told them by cell phone that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were armed with final awareness of the nature of the evil they faced . <P> So armed , they could act . So armed , they did .
