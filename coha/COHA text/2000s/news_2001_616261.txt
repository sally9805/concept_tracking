<p> Looking back on Larry Singer 's first year in Georgia , it 's tough to decide which is truer : that he has changed state government , or state government has changed him . <p> He 's certainly not the same man who , after two months on the job as executive director of the Georgia Technology Authority , proclaimed , " Government worldwide is an industrial-age structure " and , with a little help from technology , promised to change it . <p> Today , the brash 43-year-old , who drinks Diet Dr Pepper instead of coffee , acts a little less revolutionary and is n't as quick to boast . He 's a tad more , well , Southern . But Singer and the power he wields through the year-old GTA 's $82 million budget and wide-ranging authority also have changed the way things work in Georgia . <p> His relentless drive to overhaul the way the state buys and uses technology and telecommunications has left some bureaucrats licking their wounds . It has technology executives  --  even those who say they 're glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape for doing business with the state never will be the same . <p> Last week the authority opened applications from would-be bidders for a statewide telecommunications contract worth $600 million to $1 billion over seven to 10 years . It 's the largest contract in Georgia history . All state and some local government telecommunications services will be handled by one contractor , perhaps a team of private-sector firms . The contract is scheduled to be awarded early next year . <p> Nobody can say for certain what the impact of putting so many government services in the hands of a private contractor will be . <p> Singer proselytizes it will provide agencies with better , more up-to-date telecom and technology tools . That , he says , will lead to better , faster , smarter services for Georgia residents . But even he admits that the telecom contract  --  unlike anything Georgia or any other state has tried  --  is a mammoth unknown . <p> Companies like the idea that there 's up to a billion state dollars on the table , but those used to traditional ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goals , among them : Wire offices across the state for high-speed Internet access . Modernize law enforcement 's wireless network . Upgrade Georgia Public Broadcasting to digital . <p> They seem more comfortable bidding on laundry lists of equipment and services . <p> BellSouth , the Atlanta-based Baby Bell that provides most local telephone service in Georgia and across the Southeast , would n't comment on how the contract might affect the way it does business with the state . <p> Mike Levin , head of one of Georgia 's most active technology lobbying groups , the American Electronics Association , said many businesses are waiting to see what happens before they weigh in on the telecommunications contract . <p> " Georgia is one of the leaders in ... trying to put all technology spending under one roof . Time will tell whether that 's a wise move . " <p> Steve Kolodney , until last month Washington state 's chief information officer , is considered a pioneer in government use of technology . Singer  --  who met Kolodney while selling computer systems to state governments  --  describes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " strongly held opinions " with Singer . <p> If the GTA succeeds , other states are likely to use it as a model , Kolodney said . <p> " There is a real expectation and weight to taking this entity created by the Legislature and making it work . It 's a daunting task , " he said . " Larry needs to get it right the first time . " <p> Singer 's political " impatience " could prove a liability , Kolodney said , or " being bright and quick and impatient " could be just what 's needed to shake up state government . <p> Cabinet-level authority <p> The idea for the technology authority grew out of Y2K . As state agencies grappled with updating computer systems , Gov . Roy Barnes ' administration perceived the need for interagency supervision of technology planning and spending . " It became evident that all our IT ( information technology ) planning was being done on a department-centric basis and , in some cases , on a division-centric basis . Heads of departments were n't talking to their own IT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology adviser and now working with Georgia Tech 's economic development arm . Flowers oversaw Y2K planning and , later , persuaded lawmakers to pass legislation creating the technology authority . " What we really needed was a Cabinet-level organization that coordinated state technology planning as a whole , " he said . <p> Most lawmakers  --  busy grappling with tangible , constituent issues like public education  --  did n't spend much time on what some called the " geek " bill . But some resisted . " We wanted to make sure the Georgia Technology Authority did not have say over content ( on the state Web site ) , that they only had say over the process , " said state Sen. Robert Lamutt ( R-Marietta ) , vice chairman of the Senate 's Technology Committee . Republican lawmakers , agency heads and some businesspeople were " nervous , " he said . But , Lamutt said , he and others were persuaded by the promise of better-planned , lower-cost technology purchases . <p> Flowers said most skeptical lawmakers became convinced of the advantages of such an authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $9 million by buying desktop computers for several agencies at the same time . " It kind of opened everyone 's eyes , and they said , ' Oh , this is what you mean by coordinated planning . ' " <p> Singer , a former research fellow in Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government , originally came to Georgia to advise the state Department of Human Resources on how technology could ease problems plaguing the state 's child welfare system . His work with Human Resources put him in touch with people in the governor 's office , and one of Barnes ' advisers called Singer to see whether he would be interested in heading the technology authority . <p> " I told them they could n't afford me , " said Singer , who was making around $250,000 at the time at Public Interest Breakthroughs , a nonprofit he started to help states better use information technology . He was comfortably ensconced in a Washington suburb with his wife and four children . Still , he agreed to talk with Barnes . <p> " I had 15 minutes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Singer said . " I was very , very impressed . He understood everything I 'd been preaching . " <p> That 's the way Bobby Kahn , Barnes ' chief of staff , remembers it , too . " Boy , they hit it off right away . ( Singer ) is able to take this geek talk and turn it into English . " <p> Barnes said upon meeting Singer , he knew he 'd found the right person for the job . " The state 's ( information technology ) systems are years behind where they should be , and he had the kind of bold ideas we needed to bring us into the 21st century quickly . " <p> Flowers , who was passed over for the authority 's top job , said Barnes was impressed by Singer . " He 's very smart . " <p> Singer is smart and proud of it . Meet him , and it wo n't take long to learn he left high school without a diploma and ended up doing a stint at Harvard . Perched on a desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began a recent strategy meeting with a 30-minute lecture on how government evolved from patronage to bureaucracy . His clincher , his pitch , was that bureaucrats now stand at the threshold of a new system of government , one shaped by the fact that residents have immediate access to information . <p> It was a motivational talk worthy of a paid-for speaker . " The governor created us not to regulate the way agencies use technology but to help agencies better protect the environment or provide child services ... through the proper use of technology , " Singer evangelized . <p> " We 're not really the Georgia Technology Authority . We 're the modernization authority . " <p> Top salesman <p> Singer describes himself as a salesman . He is quite good at selling things  --  software , ideas , himself . His first job was a summer gig hawking ' 70s-style leather coats on college campuses . His father , who sold men 's blazers to haberdasheries across Missouri , would drop Singer at a campus with a load of jackets , make his own sales calls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fringed hides with a handful of cash . <p> Singer spent his childhood in St. Louis in a neighborhood near the Anheuser-Busch brewery . His mother worked at a teachers credit union . He was the oldest of three , the only son . When he was a teenager , his family moved to University City  --  a St. Louis suburb  --  where many Jewish families were migrating . <p> He left high school after three years , without graduating . He enrolled in the University of Redlands in Southern California , a small liberal arts college with a reputation for free thinking . <p> After graduating from Redlands , he took a job selling insurance . His sister was working for Computer Associates International and told her bosses that her older brother , Larry , could sell anything . She suggested they give him an interview . <p> From Computer Associates , Singer went to Texas Instruments , where he sold software to state governments . From there he went to Harvard , where he became the first businessperson to become a public policy fellow . <p> Singer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , two sons and two daughters , range in age from 2 to 16 . Another child is on the way . <p> Providing for five children on the $167,000 he gets annually from the state is one of the things that keeps him up at night . Another is keeping track of all the things the technology authority touches but he does n't control . <p> Singer likens his job to riding a bike . " You go really fast , and sometimes its a pain in the ... . " In his first few weeks on the job , sitting in his 23rd floor office overlooking downtown , with an electric scooter he rides from his Peachtree Street office to the Capitol plugged into the wall , Singer swore he would n't be among the bureaucrats embroiled in politics . But by October , he was taking the state plane to Albany and Augusta to meet with lawmakers . By April , he had so many political players coming through his door he required them to register as lobbyists . <p> During the spring legislative session , Singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnes establish a state privacy policy , and he helped business groups dissuade lawmakers from passing privacy legislation that could affect technology firms . <p> Still , the governor and his advisers are n't ready to leave Singer to his own political devices . <p> Tom Wade , who was a senior executive assistant to former governor , now U.S. Sen. Zell Miller , is on staff at the authority to make sure its chief executive does n't anger the wrong people . <p> Singer said they 're constantly balancing his " hairy , audacious , undeliverable goals " with Wade 's " desire that we survive . " <p> A lack of political savvy has n't kept Singer from forging ahead with plans to revamp the state 's technology planning and spending . On July 1 , the authority swallowed 600 Georgia Department of Administrative Services employees , growing five times its previous size and gaining about $25.9 million in state funds . <p> In June , the authority signed a contract with Microsoft estimated to save the state at least $15 million in software licensing fees . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site . Singer envisions Georgians one day paying taxes and getting driver 's licenses online . <p> But the telecom contract is sure to be Singer 's biggest challenge . It 's something no state has done , and others are watching . <p> For all his bravado , Singer feels the weight . " If we miss this opportunity , we 'll never get it again . " <p> Pacing around his office on a recent early morning , Singer said running the authority is the most " all-consuming " thing he 's ever done . When he signed on , he said he 'd stay two years . Now he 's extended that to three so he can deliver what he promised . <p> He admits the past year has been a cultural and political education . <p> " As a salesman , what made me special was I told the truth . People found it refreshing . " That 's not necessarily true in Georgia government , he said . <p> " The Southern way is to smile and say ' Yes , ' then come back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife into his back . <p> " I think I 'm beginning to learn the importance of discretion , and that 's a hard lesson . " <p> But more than anything , Singer said , this year has been one of maturation . <p> " When you 're fairly bright and verbal in our society , you can get away with a lot of bombast . Then you get to a place where that does n't work and you have to grow up . I think I 've hit that .
