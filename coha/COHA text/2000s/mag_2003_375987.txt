K-159 , a rust bucket of a Russian nuclear submarine , was being towed to a navy scrap yard late last month when it sprang a leak and went down in the Barents Sea . Nine sailors lost their lives  --  a fraction of the 118 who died when another Russian submarine , the Kursk , exploded and sank three years ago . But this latest sub disaster could have more serious consequences . A high-level Russian official tells TIME that K-159 " presents a threat more menacing than that of the Kursk , " a state-of-the-art submarine whose reactors were much less likely to leak radioactive material before the sub could be recovered . " There 's no telling how K-159 will hold up under water , " this source says . The wreckage is under crushing pressure , 781 ft. down , and its hull is deeply corroded . Although its reactors ground to a halt 15 years ago , the spent nuclear fuel  --  1,760 lbs . of the stuff  --  was never unloaded . Adding to the worry , K-159 sank in the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping lanes and fishing boats . Norway 's Fisheries Directorate says it is waiting for reports from Norwegian radiation authorities to assess whether the K-159 has leaked radioactive material . <P> If the Kursk recovery is any guide , salvage operations wo n't be possible before May . The Russian Naval Command has n't committed to a date but promises it will retrieve K-159 by next year  --  without foreign assistance . TIME 's source is skeptical . The navy is short on funds . Three years after the Kursk disaster , it still has n't bought the gear necessary for such an operation . The government , meanwhile , has allocated only $70 million for all nuclear clean-up and maintenance in Russia . It cost $150 million to recover the Kursk.  --  By Yuri Zarakhovich
