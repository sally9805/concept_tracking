Recent refugees join a forgotten generation of Afghans struggling to survive in border camps . Photograph // Fourteen-year-old Hameed Khan uses his hands to pull himself through the dirt , his polio-destroyed legs dragging behind him . His affliction earns him sympathy , but only about 100 or so rupees ( less than $2 ) for an eight- to 10-hour day of begging on the streets of Peshawar in Pakistan . Jahal Akbar , 10 , also puts in a 10-hour day , scrounging through the city 's garbage dumps for plastic , aluminum , and other recyclable materials he can resell . For his efforts , he brings home a mere 15 or 20 rupees a day to his family . Twelve-year-old Jumma Gul works six days a week as a tea boy in a small market in Peshawar to help support his family of six brothers and three sisters-all refugees from Jalalabad . These children are the forgotten generation of Afghanistan . Many were born in refugee camps in Pakistan , where their parents fled to escape war , drought , and famine in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been left to their own devices to survive with little assistance from governments and only sporadic help from relief organizations . Many of the children know no other life than this precarious existence . The rest of the world gave them little thought-until September 11 . The U.S. bombing in Afghanistan has exacerbated the flow of refugees from that country , but it has also focused attention on the plight of the millions of Afghan people who had already been forced to flee their homes over the past two decades . Exact numbers are hard to come by , but most estimates say some 5 million refugees have left Afghanistan since the Soviet invasion in 1979 , 1.8 million of them children . Another 1.5 million are estimated to have died in the 20 years of war , almost one third of them children . Those who left did n't go far , their transportation options limited to their own feet . Families , including young children and aging grandparents , gathered their meager belongings and walked over steep mountain passes to neighboring Iran or Pakistan . Those who stayed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim to the drought that began three years ago , resulting in another barrage of displaced people heading for the Afghanistan-Pakistan border . Many of those more recent refugees ended up in either the makeshift Jalozai camp or the more established Shamshatoo camp , both about 45 miles from the Afghanistan border . Since the American air strikes began in early October , these already overcrowded camps have been overwhelmed with thousands more refugees . Shamshatoo was already home to 50,000 to 70,000 people , and more than 80,000 were crammed into tents in Jalozai . Because of influx over the past months , the United Nations refugee agency , UNHCR , plans to relocate most of the current residents at Jalozai to more established camps in order to make room for the newcomers .

The family begs on the streets of Peshawar a few days a week . // At least before they are moved , the families at Jalozai will receive two quilts and a month 's supply of wheat flour , beans , sugar , ghee ( vegetable oil ) , and tea , thanks to an emergency distribution by Catholic Relief Services ( CRS ) in late November . CRS has had a presence in both camps since December 2000 , mostly providing health education and sanitation . " To be frank , it means we 've dug a lot of latrines , " says Joe Carney , a CRS communications associate , who visited the Jalozai camp in November . The food and blanket distribution was aimed at helping the refugees survive the winter . Last year a particularly frigid cold snap killed 150 Afghan refugees in a few days , many of them children . " The tragedy of last winter , when hundreds of Afghans froze to death in refugee camps , taught a grave lesson of what lies ahead if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CRS 's country representative for Pakistan . " This intervention is targeting the neediest families in this extremely needy camp , those whose lives truly depend on it . " Hunger and malnutrition are yearround problems in the refugee camps , but the cold compounds the lack of food . " Studies show that a warm sleeping mat or quilt can be almost as important as eating , because you can lose body weight from sleeping on the ground , " Carney says .

" Jalozai is an endless stretch of tents , but most of them are not even suitable tarps you 'd put on the floor to paint your walls , " Carney says . CRS hopes to distribute some winterized tents . " But not all 80,000 people are going to get them . " The Shamshatoo camp resembles a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blending into the nearby town . " Some of those people have been there for years , even for decades , " says Carney . Many of the refugees beg in the streets of nearby Peshawar , but others are afraid to leave the camp for fear of being deported back to Afghanistan . Tiny markets have sprung up in the camps , where people sell everything from water to thread out of tiny wooden carts . " People have ways of being entrepreneurial wherever you stick them , " Carney says . But the newest refugees-an estimated 130,000 who have fled since the U.S. air strikes-will have little time to get settled before the harsh weather hits . " We are afraid that we wo n't get food or shelter before the winter , " Amir Mohammed told CRS workers after arriving at Jalozai in late October . Like thousands of other Afghan refugees , Amir paid a smuggler to get into Pakistan . He and his wife , his brother , and his four children walked for 20 hours on a mountain trail and arrived at 2 a.m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore , " he says . Eventually , they ended up at Jalozai , which offers little comfort to new arrivals . Amir is visibly burdened by the stress of caring for his family in an unfamiliar place during uncertain times . Like most parents , his first concern is his children . " I am worried about them , " he says . " We carried bread with us , but that is gone . We 'll beg for food at the bazaar if we have to , but my children are dependent on me . " It seems not only have the refugees lost their homes and their land , they are losing hope . Many are demoralized from struggling to survive one disaster after another . The refugee camps do little to boost their morale , offering next to nothing in the way of privacy or dignity . Still , many Afghan people remain proud , and are grateful for the little assistance they are receiving . Carney recalls a 70-year-old man he recently met in Jalozai . After sticking it out through war and drought , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grenade launcher exploded near his home , killing one of his sheep . He walked with a cane for two days on a rugged mountain path to reach Pakistan . " He was obviously a very proud man , " says Carney . " He told me , " I 'm in a very bad situation now . If I got back to Afghanistan , I would n't need any help . It 's just that right now I need assistance . " Ultimately , they all want to go home . But despite the retreat of the Taliban , reports are mixed about whether the refugees can safely return to Afghanistan . Carney , speaking in late November , says it 's too early to tell . " I know people want to go back , but the stipulation is when there 's peace , " he says . Until then , thousands of Afghansyoung and old-continue to be on the move , trading war and famine at home for an uncertain future in refugee camps . " It 's not getting better , " Carney says .
