Charlie Sanchez was working at his computer in the eight-man office of Houston-based energy market managers Gelber &; Associates last Wednesday when the quotes for natural-gas futures went blank . Then West Coast spot prices for gas vanished . One by one the handful of markets that update continuously on his screen darkened like spent light bulbs . " Within a minute the screen was blank , " recalls Sanchez . There was nothing wrong with his PC . But there was something terribly wrong with the company that managed all those quotes : the brash energy-trading giant called Enron . <P> After weeks of escalating financial troubles , business had effectively collapsed in many of Enron 's most important markets . Only months earlier , Enron was considered one of the most innovative U.S. companies , having brought new-economy tools such as Internet trading and sophisticated hedging strategies to the old business of matching producers and consumers of electricity , oil , natural gas  --  and eventually some 800 other commodities and services . Its operations directly or indirectly touch almost every American home and business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dubious accounting and trading practices and piles of debt  --  surprised just about everyone from regulators to investors to thousands of soon-to-be-jobless Enron employees . Now , as the company prepares to file for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. , probably this week , huge questions loom as to how widespread the damage will be , who is to blame and what is going to be done about it . <P> No fraud or other illegal behavior has been proved  --  though those issues will be examined in a spate of lawsuits , congressional hearings and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission . This much seems clear : what went wrong was not Enron 's business plan  --  which other firms are already emulating . Rather , Enron 's fatal flaw was management hubris , tacitly encouraged by board members , regulators , politicians and stock analysts  --  many with financial ties to Enron  --  who looked the other way as warning lights began to flash . Feeling it could do no wrong , the company too often pursued unprofitable markets , obscured the costs and stiff-armed anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in complicated trades instead of simply matching buyers and sellers , and its hedges then backfired . <P> Enron shareholders , including large mutual funds and pension funds , took a nasty hit as the stock lost 99% of its value over the past year , dropping to 26cents at Friday 's market close . The Alliance Capital family of mutual funds doubled down on its Enron stake this summer as the energy company 's share value dropped from $49 to $27 , according to filings at the SEC . Alliance declined to comment on whether it has sold any of the 43 million Enron shares it owned as of Sept. 30 . <P> Enron 's 401(k) plan , available to its 21,000 employees and loaded with the company 's stock , has been devastated . The company owes banks billions of dollars . Payment of those loans is in doubt , as is payment on hundreds of millions of dollars in obligations to Enron 's trading partners . But those losses appear to be sufficiently spread out to make a wider financial crisis unlikely . There 's been no talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed hedge fund Long Term Capital Management . And so far , energy prices are stable  --  good news for consumers heading into winter .
