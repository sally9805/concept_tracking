<p> NEW YORK  --  It 's 9:03 p.m. at the crowded , cacophonous Reservoir watering hole in the East Village , and all eyes are riveted on the twin TV sets at either side of the bar , watching as one beaming blonde scopes out her buff suitors . <p> On the debut episode of ABC 's The Bachelorette ( Wednesdays , 9 p.m . ET/PT ) , Bachelor reject Trista Rehn , 29 , seeks her soul mate among the 25 competitors trying to win her over . Ryan , a firefighter , reads her a poem . Russ , a writer , gives her a Tiffany bracelet . Brian , a salesman , regales her with jokes . Back in the real world , a slew of derisive twenty- and thirtysomethings cluster around the flickering screens , mesmerized . <p> It 's the lure of the hunt , the competition for a mate  --  the reflection of their lives  --  that is drawing this crowd of young viewers and rewarding networks with surprisingly high ratings . <p> " I planned on watching the show , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see guys fighting over one woman . Girls are much more focused . . . on having the big wedding and the dream relationship , " says Michael Mullen , 27 , a burly trader at the New York Stock Exchange who nevertheless is glued to the screen . " Besides , after just one show , you know who you might be with for the rest of your life . " <p> " It 's all based on looks and money , " adds his pal and self-described reality addict Timothy Glisker , 27 , who even applied to be on Survivor 2 . " If this is about love and real attraction , how come there is n't a show about three guys who sit in a bar in the Village on a Wednesday night ? " <p> Maybe the networks would whip one up if it , too , would lure those in the ultra-desirable 18-to-34 age group . They turned out in force to watch The Bachelorette , which won its time slot with nearly 18 million viewers , and Fox 's Bachelor-with-a-twist hit , Joe Millionaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe 's Jan. 6 premiere attracted 18.6 million viewers , outperforming the premiere of every other reality series so far , and its second outing drew a strong 17.5 million to win Monday evening . ( Fox is repeating the first two episodes Thursday at 8 p.m . ET/PT . ) <p> More significant , it was the highest-rated series start on any network this season among ages 18 to 34 . That younger , freer-spending demographic is highly prized by advertisers , who will pay premiums to reach them . And those viewers seem to be flocking to the new wave of relationship reality series . The premiere of Joe Millionaire earned a high 29 share among ages 18-34 , which means 29% of those viewers tuned to it . <p> The networks steadily have been losing market share to cable and other entertainment for years . Reality shows are not only drawing in those who would not otherwise be watching , but they also are luring existing viewers from cable , according to media buyer John Rash at Campbell-Mithun . <p> " These viewers are hard to reach because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rash says . " They 're juggling busy careers and personal lives and trying to find their mates . " <p> That leaves them few hours to bond with their remotes . According to Nielsen Media Research , women in the 18-34 group watch slightly more than four hours of TV each day on average , while the men take in three hours and 47 minutes . That 's an hour less than viewers ages 35 to 64 . <p> And when they do sit down to watch , they quickly change the channel or switch to cable if they do n't instantly love , or are n't intrigued by , what they see . " There 's an unmistakable voyeuristic element to this generation . They 're willing to watch others in challenging situations , " Rash says . <p> There will be plenty of embarrassment to go around when Joe 's twist is revealed . Evan Marriott poses as a rich guy to cull his dream girl from 20 contestants , and the winning beauty will learn that her hunk is no heir . ( Fox says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , but there have been reports that he is better off than the network lets on . ) <p> " Any man who can choose from 20 women is a man after my own heart . This is the quintessential example of a man being deceitful and getting away with it , " says New York real estate broker Jim Kelly , 32 . <p> " This show has tapped into the zeitgeist of something that this particular audience is fascinated by : relationships and what makes them work , " says Fox Entertainment president Gail Berman . " They 're watching to find out what men and women are interested in , to see how much veracity is a part of that equation and to see what money means in terms of love . " <p> The payoff has been huge at ABC , where The Bachelor franchise 's success with the 18- 34 group has been eye-opening . The network , which has had a dearth of hit series , introduced Bachelor last March merely to fill a Monday-night hole ; it ended up with a blockbuster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , ABC Entertainment chief Susan Lyne , who calls it a " happy surprise , " sees the ratings writing on the wall . " We 've learned that this 18-to-34 audience is particularly drawn to a certain kind of reality show , in part because a lot of them grew up on ( MTV 's ) The Real World . They like seeing people like themselves put into situations of vulnerability , where the stakes are personally high for them . " <p> Sure , watching sexy singles flirt with one another makes for good entertainment . But rip away the window dressing and what you 're left with are desperately competitive contestants grappling with rejection and battling one another for love ( or , more cynically , stardom ) . Yet it 's that very quest for Mr. Right  --  or Mr. Maybe  --  that 's attracting young viewers . <p> " Women are watching to see what kind of woman it is that a man will pick , and men are intrigued by the curiosity of seeing women react so intensely , " says relationship expert John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is especially appealing to younger viewers , who are in the market for either finding a mate or trying to figure out what qualities they want in someone . They 're learning who 's the right person for them and how to react in those types of relationship situations . " <p> And they 're relating to those situations . " The Bachelorette is just about a smart , beautiful woman trying to find a nice guy , and ABC is nice enough to help her , " says Internet producer Nicole Perri , 25 , at the New York bar . " I 'm totally OK with her for making out with 25 guys to find her true love . " <p> Yes , The Bachelorette audience skewed heavily female , but not all viewers are cheering on Trista 's quest . " I only want to see the last episode , to see the guys ' reactions and see their expectations undermined , " says Sarah Chamberlin , 28 , a New York information technology developer . " I would not be on it , for any amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as emotional spectator sports . From the safety of the sofa , we watch people  --  not so different from that prom queen or football star who was nasty to us in 11th grade  --  getting snubbed , dumped or otherwise disgraced . <p> In that sense , they 're similar to Chuck Barris ' Dating Game , the ABC granddaddy of relationship contests that premiered in 1965 and spawned such modern hits as Love Connection , MTV 's Singled Out and Blind Date . But the new crop of reality shows brings us that much closer to the contestants , warts and all , and it 's irresistible to see how they handle the pressure . <p> " It is completely fascinating to see what happens when a circumstance brings out the worst in someone , " Gray says . " You get to see different reactions people have to rejection . It 's a hotbed of potential danger , and we want to see how people handle it . " <p> To executive producer Mike Fleiss , the man behind The Bachelor , the appeal of his programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show where you see a real romantic relationship evolve and see emotions run high , " he says . <p> The runaway success of The Bachelor series and Joe Millionaire will surely pave the way for more reality shows with ever-wackier gimmicks . Already in the wings : <p> * ABC 's Are You Hot ? , premiering Feb. 13 , lets the public vote for " The Sexiest People in America . " <p> * Fox 's Married by America , with audience members playing matchmaker , premieres March 10 in Joe Millionaire 's slot . <p> * And American Idol 's acid-tongued Simon Cowell just signed a deal with CBS to create and produce Cupid , a summer 2003 show featuring a single gal who travels cross-country and auditions eligible men who have 30 seconds to persuade her to date them . <p> And all are vying for the same audience that ca n't get enough of it .
