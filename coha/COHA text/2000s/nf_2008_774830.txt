Suffering and a Crisis of Faith // If there is an all-powerful and loving God in this world , why is there so much excruciating pain and unspeakable suffering ? The problem of suffering has haunted me for a very long time . It was what made me begin to think about religion when I was young , and it was what led me to question my faith when I was older . Ultimately , it was the reason I lost my faith . This book tries to explore some aspects of the problem , especially as they are reflected in the Bible , whose authors too grappled with the pain and misery in the world . // To explain why the problem matters so much to me , I need to give a bit of personal background . For most of my life I was a devout and committed Christian . I was baptized in a Congregational church and reared as an Episcopalian , becoming an altar boy when I was twelve and continuing all the way through high school . Early in my high school days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " born-again " experience  --  which , looking back , seems a bit strange : I had been involved in church , believing in Christ , praying to God , confessing my sins , and so on for years . What exactly did I need to convert from ? I think I was converting from hell  --  I did n't want to experience eternal torment with the poor souls who had not been " saved " ; I much preferred the option of heaven . In any event , when I became born again it was like ratcheting my religion up a notch . I became very serious about my faith and chose to go off to a fundamentalist Bible college  --  Moody Bible Institute in Chicago  --  where I began training for ministry . // I worked hard at learning the Bible  --  some of it by heart . I could quote entire books of the New Testament , verse by verse , from memory . When I graduated from Moody with a diploma in Bible and Theology ( at the time Moody did not offer a B.A. degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Wheaton , an evangelical Christian college in Illinois ( also Billy Graham 's alma mater ) . There I learned Greek so that I could read the New Testament in its original language . From there I decided that I wanted to commit my life to studying the Greek manuscripts of the New Testament , and chose to go to Princeton Theological Seminary , a Presbyterian school whose brilliant faculty included Bruce Metzger , the greatest textual scholar in the country . At Princeton I did both a master of divinity degree  --  training to be a minister  --  and , eventually , a Ph.D . in New Testament studies . // I 'm giving this brief synopsis to show that I had solid Christian credentials and knew about the Christian faith from the inside out  --  in the years before I lost my faith . // During my time in college and seminary I was actively involved in a number of churches . At home , in Kansas , I had left the Episcopal church because , strange as this might sound , I did n't think it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my evangelical phase ) ; instead I went a couple of times a week to a Plymouth Brethren Bible Chapel ( among those who really believed ! ) . When I was away from home , living in Chicago , I served as the youth pastor of an Evangelical Covenant church . During my seminary years in New Jersey I attended a conservative Presbyterian church and then an American Baptist church . When I graduated from seminary I was asked to fill the pulpit in the Baptist church while they looked for a full-time minister . And so for a year I was pastor of the Princeton Baptist Church , preaching every Sunday morning , holding prayer groups and Bible studies , visiting the sick in the hospital , and performing the regular pastoral duties for the community . // But then , for a variety of reasons that I 'll mention in a moment , I started to lose my faith . I now have lost it altogether . I no longer go to church , no longer believe , no longer consider myself a Christian . The subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier book , Misquoting Jesus : The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why , I have indicated that my strong commitment to the Bible began to wane the more I studied it . I began to realize that rather than being an inerrant revelation from God , inspired in its very words ( the view I had at Moody Bible Institute ) , the Bible was a very human book with all the marks of having come from human hands : discrepancies , contradictions , errors , and different perspectives of different authors living at different times in different countries and writing for different reasons to different audiences with different needs . But the problems of the Bible are not what led me to leave the faith . These problems simply showed me that my evangelical beliefs about the Bible could not hold up , in my opinion , to critical scrutiny . I continued to be a Christian  --  a completely committed Christian  --  for many years after I left the evangelical fold . // Eventually , though , I felt compelled to leave Christianity altogether . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left kicking and screaming , wanting desperately to hold on to the faith I had known since childhood and had come to know intimately from my teenaged years onward . But I came to a point where I could no longer believe . It 's a very long story , but the short version is this : I realized that I could no longer reconcile the claims of faith with the facts of life . In particular , I could no longer explain how there can be a good and all-powerful God actively involved with this world , given the state of things . For many - people who inhabit this planet , life is a cesspool of misery and suffering . I came to a point where I simply could not believe that there is a good and kindly disposed Ruler who is in charge of it . //
