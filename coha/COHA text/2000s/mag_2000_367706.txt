Parents like to hear their political candidates talk about whipping schools into shape and making them accountable . Easy to say . But not many parents have a clue how really hard it is to take on an entrenched , self-preserving education establishment . <P> Steve Brothers does . He 's the manager of the American Greetings plant in Osceola , Ark. , a hulking factory perched near the banks of the Mississippi where 1,500 workers make greeting cards . The 1984 Osceola High School graduate says he has trouble keeping his operation running smoothly because " I ca n't find enough people who can multiply seven times four . " Nor can he readily recruit young executives from outside the area after they learn that the state put Osceola 's school district on " academic distress " two years ago , when only 33% of 11th-graders could read at grade level , and only 8% were up to par in math . <P> Brothers , 33 , tried to help the system in the small ways he could . He organized plant tours for students , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shadowing " program , in which high schoolers tag along with employees for a day . He became an officer of the Booster Club , which supports the district 's popular athletic programs . " I could n't get a single parent to attend a planning meeting , and we had just won a state championship in football , " he says . But before ruling out the Osceola system for his five-year-old son Jackson , Brothers saw one last opportunity : to open a publicly financed charter school . Governor Mike Huckabee had signed legislation in early 1999 that would allow for as many as 12 charter schools , independent of local districts , to be established in the state . So Brothers , along with the Chamber of Commerce director , Mayor Dickie Kennemore and others settled on a plan for what they called the Arkansas Charter School . It would serve 72 kindergartners and first-graders by the fall , and its goals would be academic rigor , racial balance and parental involvement . <P> The charter-school advocates knew they would face resistance , but they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred when the state education department took a full six months after the new law was adopted to issue 12 pages of onerous rules and regulations governing Arkansas charter schools . Even at that pace , lobbyists for the state 's school boards , administrators and teachers protested that the process was moving too quickly . The bureaucratic delay left Brothers and his allies barely three months to identify an appropriate school site , draw up policies for admissions , personnel and attendance , hold a public hearing and submit a detailed application to the state .
