<p> The battle for " hearts and minds " in wartime has always been fought at home as well as abroad . It 's the main lesson today 's senior military officers learned as young lieutenants in Vietnam . <p> This has never been truer than with the US invasion and occupation of Iraq . The war was controversial from the start . President Bush , the commander in chief , is running for reelection and slipping in the polls . Whether partisan or not , opinions are more visible and often polarized . <p> The senior officer corps is not immune from the trend . At recent media events at the Pentagon , in Baghdad , and this week at the Army War College , uniformed officers led cheers for Mr. Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld . That may not be unprecedented , but it illustrates the more prominent role of public diplomacy and public relations in war . Some officers grumbled at the sight of senior officers participating in events with political overtones , at least in image value . <p> The trend is accelerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which - in the eyes of TV producers - is made more legitimate with recently retired senior officers , preferably with pointers and maps , taking part . That , in turn , leads to more analysis , which - especially in a prolonged and divisive war - leads to more opinionating . <p> In many ways , the war is being run like a political campaign . For public relations and rhetorical purposes , senior commanders and uniformed spokesmen are taking their lead from civilians at the Pentagon and in the war zone . " When military guys talk about ' terrorist death squads ' rather than ' irregulars , ' they are following political direction from the White House Office of Global Communications passed through and coordinated by the political types , " says retired Air Force Col. Sam Gardiner . He notes that senior civilian communications officials in Iraq and at Central Command previously worked for the GOP on the Florida electoral recount . <p> In terms of political inclinations , military officers do not reflect the country as a whole . A year before the 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies showed strong support for the GOP among officers . Of those surveyed , 64 percent identified with Republicans , 17 percent with Independents , and only 8 percent with Democrats . <p> One study shows absentee voting for the military ( which started after the Vietnam War ) helped lead career officers to think in more political terms . In a paper written while at the National War College , Army Col. Lance Betros concluded that " the officer corps ' voting preference does not constitute partisan activity and is not , by itself , harmful to professionalism and civil-military relations . " But Colonel Betros ( who now teaches at West Point ) also noted that such legendary military leaders as William Tecumseh Sherman and George Marshall stayed out of politics to the point where they did n't vote . <p> " They believed that meddling in politics , including voting in ... elections , eroded professionalism by weakening officers ' military expertise and undermining their credibility in providing unbiased advice to civilian leaders , " wrote Betros , who warned that the partisan trend could have " long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't necessarily harm military careers . Army Lt. Gen. William Boykin told an evangelical group in Oregon last year that although Bush had lost the popular election in 2000 , " He 's in the White House because God put him there for a time such as this . " General Boykin is now deputy to Stephen Cambone , under secretary of Defense for intelligence and one of the most influential advisers to Mr. Rumsfeld . <p> Many analysts believe the warm response to Bush at the Army War College indicated how many officers see eye-to-eye with this administration more than they did with Bill Clinton - notorious among career officers for having avoided military service and instituting a " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy allowing homosexuals to serve in uniform . " The military despised Clinton , so in Bush ... they see a more principled president , " says retired Army Col. Dan Smith . " That is , of course , arguable . But that 's what is behind the applause lines . " <p> Other observers see a trend toward " careerism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much on success in Washington as on competence in the field . <p> " Sea duty , for us Navy types , began to be a box to be checked between Pentagon assignments more than the point of one 's career , " says retired Navy Capt . Larry Seaquist . " It was a careerist 's game . One 's skills on the Washington battlefield were the personal , political skills of the staff officer and the courtier , not of the combat team leader . The result is , we have grown several crops of senior officers who are very good at Washington politicking , excellent at program acquisition , or at least PowerPoint program sales , but rather shallow on the combat command and troop leadership end . " <p> Though some - perhaps many - career officers oppose actions of the president and other senior civilians in charge of the military in Iraq , they know that speaking out can quickly end a career - or worse . The Uniform Code of Military Justice states that " any commissioned officer who uses contemptuous words against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Such inside opposition is often communicated through retired officers appearing regularly on television . Others , such as retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni , who declared the administration 's conduct in Iraq a " failure " last Sunday on " 60 Minutes , " are well known for their outspokenness . <p> " There is a lot of dissension right now about the Iraq war plan , or lack of plan , within the uniformed community , both at leadership and rank and file levels , " says Theresa Hitchens of the Center for Defense Information in Washington . " It may well be that more retired folks are speaking out because they feel that the uniformed folks can not . " <p> In any case , says a retired Army colonel , " Retired military 's involvement pro and con is unprecedented in my experience and memory of history . Even with Ike Eisenhower , it was much more muted than now . " <p> The conflict in Iraq - the first extended US combat with live TV and soldiers on the ground sending home e-mails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , which makes it especially political in an election year . This phenomenon may be all the more evident because so many reserve and National Guard troops are involved . These citizen-soldiers are much more inclined to speak out , especially when so many have had their combat tours extended and families back home are complaining . <p> " We are in a no-kidding war , and most people do n't remember Vietnam firsthand , " says John Pike , director of GlobalSecurity.org . " Those that do remember Vietnam , remember it on tape in black and white , and this war is live , in color , and high definition to boot . " <p> That 's one reason the president has used military settings to counter bad news and emphasize his agenda , analysts say . Some in the armed forces may object . But most are either enthusiastic about Bush or used to saluting and doing what they 're told . <p> " The military has no choice if the president chooses to use it as a backdrop . He is commander in chief , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friends Committee on National Legislation in Washington . " But no other president that I can remember has so tied his political fortunes to military success - not even Lincoln in the Civil War . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
