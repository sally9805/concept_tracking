Being the editor of a high-profile fashion magazine has its rewards : an impressive salary , a generous clothing allowance and at least two trips to Paris and Milan . But there are drawbacks as well : gossip columnists feast on your every hem length and heel height ; sycophantic employees copy your wardrobe ; and photographers with prodigious egos must be flattered and indulged . And then there is the pitfall of having your earnest editorial pursuits overshadowed by the more tabloid-friendly stories of where you stand on sable or mink and with whom you are allegedly at war . <P> These are some of the trials experienced in recent months by Kate Betts , 35 , the newly installed editor in chief at Harper 's Bazaar . Since September , when she assumed stewardship of the country 's oldest fashion glossy , Betts has been plotting its complete redesign , transforming everything from the magazine 's layout to its logo  --  replacing the elegant typeface with bold lettering that she hopes reflects a more youthful orientation . Formerly the fashion news director at Vogue , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ovarian cancer last April . Betts inherited a magazine that , despite earning praise for its sleek aesthetic and daring photography , has suffered from stagnant circulation . <P> The result of her efforts , on newsstands this week , has created enough buzz to spike ad pages 70% compared with the same time last year . But rather than dwell on her innovations , the media have tended to focus on the more irresistible and dramatically convenient story line that pits Betts against her former boss Anna Wintour , Vogue 's formidable editor in chief . <P> Both sides insist that any rivalry is merely professional . Vogue is the prestige fashion title for its publisher , Conde Nast , while Bazaar holds the same distinction for its parent company , Hearst . Indeed , from all reports , the women worked well together at Vogue , with Betts ' skill as a writer complementing Wintour 's impeccable eye . And with the exception of a newspaper article in which Betts , who gave birth to her first child only days after accepting the Bazaar post , expressed disappointment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women have behaved with determined gentility . Wintour praised Betts in a recent editor 's letter ( making no mention of the handful of Vogue staff members Betts took with her ) , and Betts acknowledged Wintour in her first editor 's note as well . It seems the two share more than good manners . " Kate is more effusive and engaged than Anna in general , " says a writer at Vogue , " but she can also be curt and quite intimidating . " <P> Now that she 's in charge , Betts is moving Bazaar into the sort of fashion coverage she instituted during her eight years at Vogue , where she highlighted trends from the street and created the Vogue Index , a popular , service-oriented section . " I think it 's important to provide useful information but at the same time maintain the avant-garde photography for which Bazaar has traditionally been known , " she says . " I 'd like to give people something they can relate to , that 's not foreign to them or of a certain insular world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
