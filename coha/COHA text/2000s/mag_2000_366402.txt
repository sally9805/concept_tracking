Edgar Ace Hope Jr . is n't someone you would want living next door . He has been found guilty in a string of crimes starting at age 14 , when he stole a bag of groceries , and culminating in his conviction in two separate murders in 1983 . Hope , now 40 , has admitted one of those killings , for which he is expected to receive a life sentence at a new hearing . But he steadfastly denies committing the other crime  --  the slaying of a security guard at a Chicago McDonald 's , for which he was sentenced to death . His lawyer last month detailed persuasive new evidence that implicates another man in the McDonald 's case . If , as expected , Hope is exonerated this summer , he would be Illinois ' 14th death-row inmate since 1987 to be cleared of murder . <P> Hope 's case last week helped persuade Republican Governor George Ryan , a death-penalty advocate , to take the unprecedented step of halting executions in the state . He said there would be no more lethal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that no more innocent people were headed for execution . <P> Ryan 's action comes as inmates nationwide are being put to death at an accelerating pace . Since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 , there have been 610 executions  --  98 of them last year alone . But exonerations in Illinois have surpassed the number of executions ( 12 ) , causing even hard-liners to take another look at capital punishment . <P> Over the past five years Northwestern University journalism and law students uncovered key evidence that helped overturn the convictions of seven death-row inmates in Illinois . " It 's exhilarating , " said journalism professor David Protess . " But it 's outrageous that we were the defense against innocent people being put to death . " <P> Support for the Governor 's decision comes from some surprising corners , including Chicago Mayor Richard Daley , who as Cook County State 's Attorney during the 1980s prosecuted five of the death-penalty cases that were later overturned . Daley blames the flurry of exonerations on incompetent defense counsel . A recent Chicago Tribune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been represented at trial by attorneys who were later disbarred or suspended . <P> Four other states  --  New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Indiana and Kentucky  --  are considering halting executions , while Oregon opponents are seeking a voter referendum this November to abolish them . <P>  --  By Wendy Cole/Chicago
