<p> If you 're a red-wine lover , you know the feeling - that puckery , astringent sensation that practically turns your cheeks inside out . Like overbrewed tea , an overly tannic wine seems to suck the moisture out of your mouth , leaving your palate feeling dry and battered . And you paid for that ? <p> Twenty years ago , California Cabernet Sauvignons were some of the biggest tannin offenders , as winemakers strove to make massive wines that would last . Tannin meant longevity , and if the wine was harsh and unpleasant when young , consumers would just have to wait . <p> In recent years , however , a tannin revolution has picked up steam . Realizing that the impatient American public wants wines that taste good on release , winemakers now talk about tannin-management practices that encourage desirable tannins while minimizing harsh ones . These winemakers have changed how they grow , harvest and vinify grapes to alter their wines ' tannic structure . What 's more , university research is close to giving them a tool they 've never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For consumers , these developments should mean fewer encounters with brutally tannic red wines that they think they are supposed to like . <p> " I think internationally there 's a realization that wines need to be pleasing when they 're released , that very few people are willing to put up with unpleasantness , " says Michael Havens of Havens Wine Cellars in Napa . " A lot of the reasons tannins were aggressive and drying in the past were directly traceable to growing and processing . " <p> Winemakers have long known that grapes contain thousands of tannic compounds , known as phenolics . Most of the tannins are in the skins and seeds , and they are extracted during the winemaking process . They are an excellent antioxidant , or natural preservative , and they give the wine structure . But winemakers also know , from sensory experience , that all tannins are n't created equal . Some are harsh and bitter ; others are round and pleasing . Some taste " green " or unripe ; others taste mature . <p> Despite an accepted winemaker lingo that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green tannins and ripe tannins , researchers have never been able to pinpoint which tannins , or combination of tannins , contribute to each sensation . But winemakers ' palates tell them these differences exist , and that what matters to wine quality is n't total tannins , but which tannins . <p> " To me , tannins should be chewy , " says Rudy von Strasser of von Strasser Winery in Calistoga . " They should fill your mouth and at first seem very big , but not aggressive or astringent . Chewy tannins have a softness to them . " <p> Havens says that good tannins create a " sensation of volume " in the mouth . Others say , similarly , that they round out the wine , giving it breadth . Harsh or unripe tannins are the rough , puckery , drying ones . " You feel tannins , you do n't taste them , " says Daniel Barron , winemaker for Silver Oak Wine Cellars in Oakville . <p> Doug Adams , a professor of viticulture at UC Davis , says the astringent feeling that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with salivary proteins . " So your tongue feels the roughness of the cheeks and gums because the lubricating proteins in the mouth have been removed , " says Adams . <p> For winemakers , the challenge is twofold : to grow grapes with a predominance of good tannins , and to extract only these good tannins during processing . But defining the goal does n't make it easy to reach . <p> " Tannin management makes it sound like there 's a dial to turn the tannins down , " says Barron . Instead , the effort starts in the vineyard , with careful attention to growing what 's now called a " balanced vine , " with just enough leaves , or canopy , toripen the fruit . <p> In times past , California growers let their vines sprawl and produce enough leaves to keep the grapes from sunburning or raisining . " We allowed the canopy to grow to its full jungle happiness rather than opening it up to air and light , " says Havens . <p> Not anymore . Many growers now train their vines on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The added sunlight helps develop quercetin in the grapes , a phenol related to the softer tannins . <p> Winemakers also have a better handle on how to manage irrigation so the vine stops growing at the right time . " You do n't want Cabernet vines growing when they ought to be ripening fruit or you get unripe tannins , " says Cathy Corison of Corison Winery in St. Helena . " The best vineyards hold lots of moisture for spring and summer but run out of water when they 're supposed to be ripening grapes . " <p> Harvest parameters have also shifted , with tannin in mind . Winemakers used to pick when the grapes reached a certain Brix , or sugar level - typically around 23 or 24 percent . Now they acknowledge that California 's abundant sunshine can produce grapes that are sugar-ripe before the tannins are fully mature . They still measure the sugar , but they also chew on the grape skins and seeds to evaluate astringency and grape maturity . If the seeds are still green , many will let the grapes hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost became a joke last year , " says Barron . " A grower would say , My Cab is at 27 ( degrees Brix ) , but the winemaker wo n't let me pick because he says the seeds are n't ripe . ' " <p> Consequently , some winemakers have also concluded that watering thirsty vines near harvest time - a practice once scorned by top producers because it would water down the grapes - is no longer unthinkable , especially in a hot spell . " The vines have to be able to go the distance , " says Corison . If they are in danger of shutting down before the harsh tannins have softened , many winemakers will give them a drink . <p> In the cellar , winemakers have replaced their equipment and adjusted their methods to minimize harsh tannin extraction . Crushers are more gentle now and do n't damage the seeds , says Havens . Wineries use more gentle pumps to deliver the wine to barrels and tanks . And many have changed the way they pump the fermenting wine over the cap - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extracting color , tannin and flavor . <p> " We used to blast the cap , " says Corison . " Now we use a gentle sprinkle . It 's more a matter of trickling the wine through and keeping the skins in contact ( with the juice ) . " The old method made sense , says Corison , when the goal was to extract maximum character from the skins . " Now we think in terms of getting the good stuff out and leaving the bad stuff . " <p> Winemakers have other ways of influencing tannin extraction : by altering the temperature or speed of the fermentation , and by macerating the wine for days or weeks with the skins , rather than pressing the wine off the skins after fermentation . <p> Corison believes in a hot and fast fermentation , followed by maceration to soften the tannins . At Chalk Hill Estate Vineyards &; Winery in Healdsburg , winemaker Bill Knuttel advocates virtually the opposite approach . By not adding commercial yeast and letting fermentation begin slowly and spontaneously , he gets three to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of the juice before alcohol develops , he says . <p> Every winemaker 's recipe changes depending on the vintage and vineyard , but in almost every cellar , the goal is a wine with soft yet mouth-filling tannins . <p> Seven years ago , Havens began experimenting with a new and still controversial tannin management technique called micro-oxygenation . In standard cellar practice , young red wines are " racked " regularly , pumped out of their barrels temporarily so that sediment can be removed . By exposing the wine to oxygen , racking helps the wine develop . <p> " We go to all this trouble to bring the wine to oxygen , " says Havens . " Could we not bring the oxygen to the wine ? " <p> Using an approach developed in France to soften the tannic Madiran wines , Havens oxygenates his wines continually with tiny micro-bubblers that remain in the tank or barrel for months . Havens says the technique is now widespread in Bordeaux and that dozens of California wineries are trying it . " All wines get oxygen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues Havens . " We 're just controlling it a little better . " <p> He has n't been using the technique long enough to know how well such wines will age , but he says his micro-oxygenated wines taste fruitier , livelier and more youthful than the same wines not subjected to the process . <p> Larry Stone , the noted sommelier at Rubicon in San Francisco , is skeptical . " It really limits their life span , " says Stone . " I 've had wines , like the 1990 Pomerols , that should still be youthful and they are tasting tired already . ( Micro-oxygenation ) can make a young sample taste better , but is that a good thing ? I do n't think so . Many prominent ( Bordeaux ) estates that receive high ( Robert W. ) Parker scores use micro-oxygenation , and they 're proud of it . But the jury 's out about whether it will shorten ( the wines ' life ) . " <p> Adams ' research at UC Davis should give winemakers yet another instrument in their tannin management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test to measure tannin in wine , based on the fact that tannin precipitates protein . By mixing wine with a protein solution , the tester can create a precipitate , separate the tannin from the precipitate and measure it . <p> Not long ago , a winery sent to see how their wines compared to the acclaimed ones . Adams envisions a day when winemakers might have measurable tannin targets and use his analysis to determine , for example , when to press the wine . <p> For winemakers who believe that wine character lies more in tannin quality than quantity , such a test may have limited allure . " I think , " says Corison , " we can taste things that are very hard to quantify . " <p> E-mail Janet Fletcher at wine@sfchronicle.com.
