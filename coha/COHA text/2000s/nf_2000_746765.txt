In American education , dance has grown from the top down . America 's colleges and universities have developed the most substantial network of professionals working toward strategic goals for dance in public education . In elementary education , only 4 percent of our nation 's schools provide a regular , sequential , dance education taught by a dance specialist . The numbers are even lower for dance instruction in our middle and high schools. ( n1 ) Dance in K-12 education lacks the critical mass in instruction and the regular involvement of professional dance educators necessary to develop a policy base and acquire a nationally recognized sense of academic significance . Without a substantial network of in volved dance educators striving toward common goals , sharing similar educational perspectives , and united in their concerns for the future , dance in K-12 education will continue to be of peripheral educational concern . Nevertheless , issues that emerge out of societal trends and contemporary culture do affect and influence the K-12 dance educator . Of particular interest are topics of tradition , experiment , diversity , and change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their impact on dance education to a variety of student populations . Tradition <p> The beginning of a new century and millennium is a good time for dance educators to talk about tradition . Be cause much of the heritage of dance is passed on through the " voice " of the moving body , teacher to student , retaining a clear sense of things past is important to ensuring a vital future . In education for the ballet , tradition is the established norm , passing down elements of culture from generation to generation , in styles , in repertory , and in pedagogy . In modern educational dance there is much less sense of tradition . This is true not only because educational dance has that modern term preceding it  --  and it has n't been around as long as the ballet  --  but also because " tradition , " as a notion , a value , and a sensibility in teaching , early on in ther twentieth century became entwined with what progressive educators thought was wrong with education . I wonder if , after almost a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deliberate renewal of the notion of tradition in our thinking and doing in dance education . I believe we would do well to value a broader role for tradition in all aspects of our teaching . <p> It seems to me that in recent years many in our field have lost touch with a tradition for educational dance that is individually liberating , conceptually based , and creatively focused . I ask young educators , " What concepts are you working with in class ? " More often than not I get a quizzical look back . I watch dance technique classes for evidence of some conceptual or creative infusion by the instructor  --  prompting students toward problems to be solved , toward individual solutions achieved  --  and rarely see a conscious application . Has a thoughtful educational tradition in dance been diminished as a result of the infusion of professional art standards into the dance curriculum ? Have we turned toward the acquisition of technical skill in our teaching , to the detriment of the broader educational goals of fostering individual creativity , kinesthetic facility , and personal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lose touch with these educational traditions because in the face of rampant experiment and change in the professional dance world , holding on to tradition in the academic seemed rather quaint and old-fashioned ? Are we referencing , valuing , and promoting tradition in dance education for the benefit of the teachers of tomorrow ? How do we retain a healthy respect for , and understanding of , tradition in educational dance , in theory and in performance , and still remain contemporary and forward thinking ? <p> Dance entered the curriculum not under the rubric of aesthetic dance , interpretive dance , or even , modern dance , but found its first substantive place in our schools through the practice of what were called the national dances or folk dances of European origin . Progressive educators like Herbert Spencer , G. Stanley Hall , and later John Dewey felt that the student 's participation in the national dances  --  and in creative dances of work , play , and cooperative living  --  would well prepare the young learner for life and living in a democratic community . <p> Progressivism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body was placed , and it was practice in the social traditions represented by the national dances , and dances of work , play , and community , that were the reference for experience based dance education in its early years . As one commentator says , <p> For a long time , the only dance which was admitted into our sacred realms was of one kind : folk dancing . Our dance experience in the schools began with the " Danish Dance of Greeting " and ended with " Gathering Peascods " . . . . Like systems of gymnastics , dances had to have a foreign label to be acceptable. ( n2 ) <p> Over time , in the nascent curriculum for dance in the academy , attention to the national transmogrified into attention to the aesthetic , and then into the natural , and from the natural to the creative . <p> By the late 1920s a new kind of teacher-training program in dance was centered around an understanding of the science and rhythmic underpinnings of movement and the generation of individually creative artistic statements through dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dance " and was developed by Miss Margaret H'Doubler . In the 1930s and 1940s , dance educators , seeking an academic identity separate from that of their colleagues in physical education  --  and exposed to the dynamic of the early modern dancers via the Bennington School of the Dance and the developing " Gymnasium Circuit "  --  began to turn toward the professional realm of concert dance for models in training , art making , and thinking . Encroaching professionalism caused great consternation among the physical educators who managed dance programs in the schools , as they wondered aloud if the techniques for training developed by the modern dancers might not actually harm the adolescent body . By the 1950s there was a conceptual struggle of sorts brewing between a liberally focused , individually creative , educational dance and a professionally influenced , art-based , educational dance , with both vying to be at the center of the curriculum . <p> By the 1970s leaders in dance education had largely turned toward professional norms in choreography and technique , in part to help define standards and to focus dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the schools , as graduates of programs in dance education carried a professionally oriented aesthetic with them into what limited teaching opportunities were available in K-12 education . <p> State funded artist in education programs introduced the artist directly into K-12 education , helping reinforce the notion that the professional artist could also be a professional educator . Reliance on the professional artist to act as educator undoubtedly has helped dance come to a significant degree of academic individuation , perhaps most importantly in the eyes of school administrators . Perhaps , however , it has also worked against notions of educational tradition in dance . Have we , in some important ways , lost touch with the goals of education  --  to expand the boundaries of knowledge , to assist the student in becoming a mature and contributing member of society , and to pass on our cultural heritage , by accepting a professionally oriented , and often individually determined , approach to dance in education ? <p> As a practical matter , where are the record and tradition one might expect to benefit from in all the dances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ; where are the record and benefit of this productivity ? Are we treating the product of our efforts , especially in performance , as we would an artistic version of paper plates , as something disposable ? What responsibility do we have for saving , and referencing , the record of our and our students ' productivity ? Simply turning on the video camera to record our dancing and dance making does not rise to the goal of preservation for a considered posterity . <p> Today , as we contemplate and endorse the end of political , cultural , and intellectual colonialism in education , it is time perhaps to recognize that an expansion in our world view requires considerating how our new vision affects the traditional means we continue to use to organize and manage education . How will a profound conceptual retooling of knowledge , and an associated rethinking and expansion in the notion of who the players are in education , the arts and art teachers among them , meet the essentially static nature of how the knowledge business in America is traditionally structured and managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to educational dance . It is our field 's chief strength and yet also , perhaps , its chief weakness . Experiments in the educational curriculum for dance first blossomed in our colleges and universities . Inspired by the writings and pronouncements of Isadora Duncan and the exponents of progressive education , Miss Gertrude Colby developed the nation 's first substantive , teacher-training program in dance at Teacher 's College of Columbia University in 1913 . Colby 's program was titled " Natural Dancing " and was introduced with statements such as the following : <p> For years we have been teaching rhythms and dramatic games in our kindergartens . The singing and dramatic games have led naturally to the folk dances of more or less difficulty for the older boys and girls ; but the rhythms have ceased with the primary grades  --  discarded as childish  --  with no thought of the loss of education of their wonderful joy-giving , imagination producing qualities . <p> Our purpose in developing Natural Dancing has been to carry on the rhythms of childhood to a higher form of the art of dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff . " We have tried to preserve the natural spontaneity of the child while developing depth and maturity of expression and experience. ( n3 ) <p> Several years later , at the University of Wisconsin , Margaret H'Doubler , a basketball coach , began her experiments with a new approach to dance in education . In the spring of 1917 H'Doubler arrived at a new understanding for dance education following her work with a group of children taught by Alys Bentley , a music teacher working out of a studio in Carnegie Hall . The essence of H'Doubler 's epiphany came to her suddenly . Miss Bentley had her students lie on the studio floor and explore the function and feeling of joint actions . As H ' Doubler explains in her oral history : <p> It came to me in a flash . . . Get on the floor where we are relieved from the pull of gravity . . . . Where you could work out and see what the structural response was to the change of position in movement. ( n4 ) <p> H'Doubler traveled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was focused on joint articulations , explorations of rhythm and kinesthesis , and individual creativity . Miss H'Doubler 's summer teacher-training program at Wisconsin was an important stop for the serious dance educator during the middle decades of the twentieth century . <p> In the 1930s the early modern dancers experimented at the Bennington College Summer School of the Dance . They included Martha Graham , Doris Humphrey , Charles Weidman , and Hanya Holm in technique and dance making ; John Martin in history ; and Louis Horst in experimenting with grafting contemporary art theory into choreography classes . Professional dance art standards made their first inroads into the school 's dance curricula as women physical educators flocked to the Bennington campus for summer study . In the 1960s , the colleges experimented with creating dance major programs newly independent of their long affiliation with physical education . Teacher-training programs evolved away teaching dance technique , choreography , history , and theory . What better way to symbolize a new identity for dance , at long last freed from a tradition of being considered just another form of physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance throughout this century , has in many cases become the foundation of a new tradition . Much of the experimentation seems to have come about in a serendipitous manner  --  almost , but not quite fully , by accident . Experiment may face a number of challenges in the future : What 's next ? Will we be afforded the resources and time necessary for experiments of substance ? Are we anticipating the experiments needed to help dance grow in stature and recognition in American elementary and secondary education ? Are we systematically looking for proof of the positive effects of a dance education , or are we continuing to rely on anecdotal evidence in making the case for curriculum-based , sequential , dance education in our schools ? Is there a dance equivalent to the " Mozart Effect , " perhaps an " Isadora Effect " ? Should we , like our friends the scientists , project the next steps in the experimental sequence ? Is there something to be learned from the scientific method in this regard ? Diversity <p> Diversity is a term that has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of educational disenfranchisement . Diversity is the guidepost in contemporary thinking for education and for educational dance  --  a guidepost many of us intuitively understand represents the future of learning , of our culture , and of fruitful , cooperative , and constructive living on our planet . In dance , considering diversity leads to many questions . <p> For many dance educators , tradition confronts us as it arrives at , and intersects with , diversity . Anthropologist Joann Kealiinohomoku asked us to consider ballet as a form of ethnic dance thirty years ago ; ( n5 ) many then were startled at this idea . The field has expanded its thinking since , but I confess I still wonder about our actions . For many , " world forms " are non-Western dance forms that are learned and presented as a kind of corporal tradition , as cultural artifact of and by the body . In such contexts dance is often imitated and presented , but is not evolutionary or creatively stimulating . In teaching and practicing world forms , do we clearly and fully understand the goal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationale might state that the student practices a form while simultaneously studying the cultural and physical geography of the region the form evolved from ; the people who have traditionally done the dance ; its component aspects ; its rhythmic structure , gesture , part and whole body usage , and accompanying music and costume . If this approach is n't applied to all forms that students are exposed to , including modern and ballet forms , then the frame of reference for dance that is not-modern or not-ballet is that of " Other , " and of being of and about " Other . " <p> Beyond thinking about diversity as it is manifest through performance and the practice of movement techniques , how else must we rethink the curriculum to actually go about diversifying dance as an academic discipline ? Are there new ways to consider the impact that diversity may have on creative expression through dance ? What is the effect of diversity on choreographic experiment ? Does attention to diversity , and the ac companying important considerations of appropriation , authenticity , acculturation , and transculturation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Western-trained dance educators in discussing and de constructing non-Western dance forms , for the purposes of cultural understanding , movement analysis , or stimulating movement invention in choreography ? Is every thing up for grabs , or are some things sacred ? Do we know the difference ? <p> Is attention to diversity in the curriculum , at least in part , being promoted because this enhances the educational program as commodity ? Education is more product-driven business than many of us are willing to admit . I 'm reminded of going to the auto parts dealer . It used to be that if you lived anywhere other than a major metropolitan area , you could n't get anything that was n't General Motors , Ford , or Chrysler . You had to travel to the big city to get that Mercedes part . God forbid you should break down in Kansas . Then , in the early 1970 's , foreign specialist stores opened up in the suburbs . Today the local Hyundai , Buick , Volkswagen , Nissan , Chevy dealer of Oakland provides me with my Toyota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like WalMart , the superstore , it 's all about one-stop shopping . Are we embracing diversity , at least in part , for similar reasons ? <p> How have we framed diversity in practical terms in the curriculum ? Is our attention to providing the movement experience diverting our attention from the long-term place the substance of diversity will have in the curriculum ? Outside considering non-Western dance forms , how do we fit musical theater and jazz dance forms into an educational dance curriculum ? How do we reconcile our experiments with diversity with the strength of our traditions in training the body and in cultivating the craft of choreography ? Is an evolution out of a tradition of focusing on modern and ballet concert dance forms for the acquisition of technique , and the making of dances , truly being considered by the field ? Does attention to the issues of diversity necessitate a large-scale re thinking of the educational purpose of studies in dance at all levels of education ? I believe it does . Change <p> In the history of dance in education , change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts at stimulating evolution in others . It constitutes a kind of plate tectonics of our field . Tradition , experiment , and diversity , all demand attention ; all require change and adaptation . How does attending to the work of change in dance education  --  in addressing the issues of tradition , experiment , and diversity  --  sit with the disintegration of the barrier and the conduit of time that is indicative of this age of the information superhighway ? Has the demise of " turnaround time " or " time to mull over it " affected the evolution , quality , and result of change for dance as we enter the new millennium ? <p> Has change , and the rush to meet , greet , and implement change , come to be at odds with the business of humane daily living ? Is the demand for change too quickly upon us , as we receive , take in , and appreciate yet another new model , or new concern for action and then quickly realize " Oops ! Now its time to rush on to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution , dramatically shortening the breadth of its landscape . Cyber-time jumps over evolution to unleash upon us unrefined change , producing sudden and dramatic shifts in the basic educational geography that supports and permits our daily work . It seems we have no time to react to change before we are well within it and before the demands of its instigators must be met . <p> This set of cultural forces is both countered and informed by another , especially in American popular culture . Here , change and time seem to be stuck , to be standing still , as our culture revisits itself over and over , and as neoclassicism and neopopism vie with neoconservatism and neo-hippie-ism for people 's attention . I pull up to a traffic intersection and hear the music of the group , The Who , blaring out of a teenager 's car window . I think , " That music is felt as contemporary for that sixteen-year-old , yet the music itself is thirty years old . " Can you imagine a 1939 recording by Bing Crosby blaring out of my tape deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as contemporary and expressive of my feeling of time and place in culture ? Such strange forms of nostalgia are regularly punctuated by terrible violence among youths . What has changed ? It may be that the result of no time for change ( producing recycled popular culture ) is colliding with too much exposure to change ( evident in rapid shifts in vocational prospects , too much information , an uncertain multiculturalism ) , and there seems to be no in-between . Fear and dread emerge out of the ongoing collision of the numbingly familiar , and sudden , uncertain change , leaving the less resilient among us stunningly disengaged . Emotional responses , like information requests , are in need of immediate attention , and these mutate quickly . Without apparent warning , with little room for edification , and with little room for any sense of invested ownership , things simply , and quite suddenly , are . <p> The ground of tradition and time for a thoughtful evolution collides with electronic time and the impossible tenets of cyber-reality . We in the academy  --  within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laboratories and presence of our experiments , increasingly aware of , and confounded by , our human diversity , simultaneously resisting and insisting on change-look one to the other and ask , " What can we do ? " <p> My thoughts on the future of these matters as they affect dance education is predicated on an acceptance of their inherent connectedness . I believe we must evolve and expand the circumference of our thinking and consider the topics of tradition and experiment , diversity and change , as co-existing , as feeding off of , and into , one another . Where the previous tendency may have been to separate these matters out and consider them in isolation , we might do well to appreciate the strategic interrelatedness of tradition and experiment , diversity and change . With that said , subsequent suggestions for consideration and action , it seems to me , may better lead toward the future shaping of policy . <p> The notion of tradition , for example , is in dire need of being rewoven into the fabric of active consideration by dance educators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet we rarely explicitly articulate , celebrate , critique , or record them . On another level , recognizing and living with tradition seems to be diametrically opposed to the functions of permitting experiment , implementing diversity , or anticipating change . It is as if these latter three can not thrive in the company of tradition . The all-or-nothing mentality that frames so much of our day-to-day thinking seems to have convicted tradition of being out of touch , failed , and even dangerous . For some , an active sensibility toward tradition in education has come to be associated with intolerance , racism , or sexism . Tradition may also suffer from its association with ultraconservative politics , where the extreme agendas of the political right or left meet in that curious region of advocacy for universal values and social control . To be sure there are traditions in education we are better off having evolved out of , but certainly not all that we once valued and implemented is of that kind . <p> I believe we must look toward those aspects of tradition that still support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounting a sort of educational recycling effort where we salvage what we can for retooling and continued use . The ideas , values , and notions that underpin traditions arrived at that status precisely because they were and are useful . Preserved and valued elements of tradition may be the best antidote for the ravages of unedited change , thoughtless diversity , or poorly planned experiments . <p> Experiment promises a prosperous and evolutionary future for any population . Experiments speak both to the internal community that sponsors them and to that community 's external observers . The potential benefit of considered experiment far outweighs the deliberate and time-consuming nature of its execution . Out of experiment springs that which becomes the essence of tradition . Now may be a good time for the field to plan the experiments necessary for a focused , rational , and successful projection for dance education in the twenty-first century . Ideas for experiment in dance education abound , and many have been conceptualized , but few have been systematically explored or engaged . Certainly making a concerted effort to get beyond the anecdotal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our young people is an experiment worth pursuing . We would also do ourselves a favor by revisiting and indexing the experiments of the past instead of always reinventing the wheel . <p> Diversity is a topic and agenda in need of critical examination by dance educators . In some ways providing a palette of dance experiences has come to represent dance as an academic body of knowledge . The philosophical and practical matters that surround the implementation of educational goals through diversification of the curriculum in dance need to be brought into the light of discourse and thoroughly examined . We may be implementing some diversity programs in part as a result of a type of educational guilt , as an example of being Other-directed , so to speak , and in response to what we are told we should do . I believe the field must consider and conceptualize the ramifications of the implementation of diversity in our curriculum , including its substance , its contribution to the broader goals of education , and its future evolution within the discipline . In truly creating a place for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house of our experience and the landscape of our work . This is no easy task . It will take time . Empowering diversity should proceed in reference to tradition , as a result of experiment , and in tandem with a sane pace for the processes of change that engaging and appreciating an expanded universe mandate . <p> Change is the least manageable of the issues addressed here . Like fire or water , change is a good servant and a dangerous master . Change is effervescent , ubiquitous , volatile , and often outside our control . We may however , be able to better frame a reference point in considering and managing change , by attending to , cultivating , and valuing our traditions . The same may be said of the active use of experiment to corral the often chaotic spirit of change . Whenever possible we must insist on time for a considered evolution when change is deemed necessary . When forced by contingency to accept change quickly , we must rely on the foundation of our traditions , the breadth and substance of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support us as the currents of change buffet our sense of security and place . <p> Let us tie the importance of these notions together in our thinking and in our projections and actions for the future of dance education : Tradition may come to be our oldest and best friend and ally ; experiment may be our most considered and valuable investment ; diversity may come to represent our expanded potential through understanding , acceptance , and delight with the vastness of our universe ; and change may once again find a humane pace in its evolution . Separated out , and experienced in isolation , tradition and experiment , diversity and change can only add to the cacophony and frustration of attempting to educate the living , expressive moving body outside a considered and more human context . Humans are not concepts , or electronically managed ideas . We need time to consider and evolve opinions , and we seek the opportunity to make connections . Thinking about tradition , diversity , experiment , and change devoid of their relatedness fragments our thinking and our experience in life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Dance Education Association . <p>
