A mere thirty-eight years ago it was when Mr. Disch 's work first graced our pages , August 1964 to be precise , and over the years he has introduced us to problems of creativity , taken us on wings of song , given us a man who had no idea , and shown us intrepid kitchen equipment . Now he shares with us a brief but pointed tale in hopes once again of helping us understand human behavior . <p> " I LOVE THEM ALL QUITE dearly , " Xglotl declared tipsily , " old and young , male and female , the righthanded and the lefties equally . But I shall never - " It siphoned up the last of the lubricant . "  --  never understand them . " " Because they eat meat ? " Rwng wondered , glancing up from her plate of cherried vermin . " How hypocritical ! You think nothing of snacking on their embryos , even though you credit them with rational thought . " " Well , it all depends on your definition of " rational , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll give you that . Their kilns and ovens and oasts are quite wonderful , and I will be shipping back several to my compeers in Red Sands . They collect objets d'Earth of that sort . " " Really . I 've a small trove of nuclear warheads tucked away somewhere near Irkutsk . Do you think they 'd be interested in those ? " " No , they prefer homelier artifacts . And movies with Grace Kelly . They adore Grace Kelly , do n't ask me why . " " I wo n't . Go back , please , to the issue you 're avoiding - what it is you do n't understand about them , if it 's not that they are carnivores . " Xglotl decanted more of the lubricant into his oilcan . " Their religious beliefs . " " But , Xglotl , you 're a machine . You ca n't understand anyone 's religious beliefs , whatever planet they may come from . " " Oh , I understand yours well enough . You think you 're God . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my needs , and that 's all a religion has to do . " " Let us begin there then , with regard to the Earthlings and their needs . In the Greco-Roman culture , as it evolved over time , religious faith came ever more to resemble poetic license . Zeus and Hera were a sit-com couple , like Homer and Marge Simpson . Their execution might be of a superior order , the work of a Phidias or a Praxiteles , but their psychology was rudimentary . He was the philandering paterfamilias , she the nagging and vengeful stay-at-home mom . " " Just like the people who worshipped them . People want to worship being just like themselves . It is a universal truth . " " I 'll grant that , but I can see no evolutionary advantage in delusions of omnipotence . All those stories about parting the Red Sea and bringing down the walls of Jericho - it 's wish fulfillment . " " No , it 's the power of prayer . When people pray to me ( and I choose to hear them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those cases you mention . " Xglotl emitted a subdued strobe of skepticism and continued as though it had n't heard Rwng 's nonsense : " To me religious faith is like children believing they can fly if they wear a bath towel for a cape . And those who act on such a misguided faith will suffer for it . " Rwng used her little paper umbrella to spear one of the cherries decorating the wriggling mice . " Well , one evolutionary advantage would be the placebo effect . People of faith recover more quickly from disease . There seems to be some link to the immune system . But the basic reason , I 'm sure , is that they 're happier . Just as I am happier from knowing that I 'm God . " " But everyone ca n't be God . " " Indeed no , " Rwng agreed quickly . " And a good thing , too ! Even several gods in one family is a recipe for trouble . Fortunately I 'm an orphan , unmarried , and without friends , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm ideally suited , therefore , to be the deity of a monotheistic religion . " " You know , do n't you , that I consider you delusional ? " " You 're entitled to . You have free will - as much as any mere machine may be said to have free will . " Rwng popped one of the larger mice into her immense maw . " Also , there 's this , which .... Mmm , so savory ! There is the need for love . As much as we need nourishment we need love . Even machines need to feel there is some Thing that loves them . " " Not that I 'm aware Xglotl said with a supercilious swiveling of its antennae . " To be unaware of one 's need for love is almost as common as the need itself . Oh , that 's rather good , is n't it ? I think I 'll jot it down . " Rwng disgorged a pocket notepad and typed a quick memorandum to herself . " I can understand such a need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an extension of their dependency on the maternal flow of blood while in the womb , and their later reliance on the mother as a source of milk . " Rwng 's bosom heaved responsively . " But just because one has an atavistic hunger for milk - " Xglotl 's syphon made a slurping sound in its oilcan. can not be a good reason for believing in - " " In what , Xglotl ? Speak up . " Rwng was sitting facing away from the entrance . She had not seen the crouched panthers materialize beneath the hanging ferns , the grape clusters spilling down the colored glass front of the slot machine . She did not catch the sharp scent of olibanum . She did not see the bartender metamorphose to a fish , his dandruff changing , flake by flake to silvery scales , nor did she witness the cocktail waitress shrink into a lynx and leap onto the bar in a single bound to lick the wine stains from its mirrored surface . She did not see the god Bacchus smile and , as briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Xglotl , not unastonished , " perhaps I am wrong . Perhaps there is something I 've left out of my equations . " " Do you mean to say that you are actually letting me win an argument ! " Rwng exulted . " Mm , " said Xglotl . " If you pick up the tab .
