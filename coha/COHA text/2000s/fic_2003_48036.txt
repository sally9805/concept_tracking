I <p> IN THE AUTUMN OF 1963 , on his weekly trip to the supermarket on Presidio Avenue in San Francisco , Alan Bragle filled his wagon with the usual staples , what he considered necessities : cereal , eggs , milk , a lettuce , tomatoes , bananas , six apples , frozen broccoli , spinach , mixed peas and carrots , some sliced ham , Muenster cheese , a seven-grain packaged bread , a container of orange juice with some pulp , two gallons of bottled water , and a tomato-shaped plastic container of house-brand ketchup . The ketchup was on sale with a coupon he 'd cut out of the Chronicle . He did n't usually buy house-brand ketchup because , unlike a traditional ketchup bottle , the plastic tomato gasped air and spit red oozy worms when he pressed its sides ; the last bloody dregs were impossible to access . But the price was right . <p> Alan 's first produced play was about one of those tomato-shaped horrors and his ancient electric coffee maker that made a hissing , slurping , heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only characters ; the play had no dialogue besides their erotic liquid huffing and puffing . It was performed at a local coffee house that featured the work of emerging avant-garde artists of which he considered himself one , albeit the oldest in that crowd . <p> Alan was about to turn forty and already had several swings at bat in the theatrical ballpark , but since he had n't exactly emerged , he felt at home in the presence of aspiring writers , poets , filmmakers , actors , painters , and sculptors who still had bits of shell and twigs from the nest tangled in with their young dreams . Most of the troop accepted him without question . For some he was a benevolent father figure , tall , slightly bent like an elongated crescent moon , with a long face , big ears , and large , sympathetic blue-green eyes that someone once described as the yolks of bird eggs . A few of the neophytes resented him since he reminded them of the possibility of failure , even death . Alan was seasoned enough and wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work . <p> In any case , his play , The Ersatz Tomato and The Passionate Perk , was a rousing success for all concerned . Following a spirited audience autopsy , probing method and meaning , Alan was invited home by the girl who played The Perk and scored with her on a futon that lay like an animal skin on her linoleum floor . <p> The next morning , she told him she was not a promiscuous girl by nature but subject to PCSS . Alan felt secure enough to ask her what that meant considering the fact that he was slightly obsolete when it came to certain acronyms and the names of current celebrities . She told him PCSS meant Post Creative Stress Syndrome , that impersonal sex was the best way she knew of sloughing off the tension and depression that came when a performance ended . Alan accepted that and went off to his day job as manager of a health food restaurant . He realized The Perk had spared him from his own version of PCSS and felt grateful to the lovely bud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging was an occasional unexpected merging that always left him optimistic about the future . He was in no hurry to be discovered . The few gray hairs he 'd noticed on his head , chest , and privates gave little cause for alarm . The Perk was easily half his age but if he felt warmly protective , even paternal toward her ( and the others who 'd opened to him ) , he did n't really feel older , not in the cosmic sense , only slightly wiser . " Being forty , " he told many girls , " means that I 've lived two minutes for every minute you 've lived , give or take , and that 's all it means , no more , no less , no big deal . " <p> When Alan finished his shopping for basics he always allowed himself two secret pleasures . To counteract what he called the organic arrogance of his customers ( who chewed sprouts and gargled a new product called soy milk ) , he 'd buy himself a package of trusty Mallomars , Little Debbies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage to remind him of his humanity . Alan 's other gratification was to stand staring at the fish counter , part killing ground , part aquarium . <p> While he was allergic to just about anything that lived in an ocean , river , lake , or stream , he was fascinated by the looks and shapes of aquatic life forms . The wet gloss of shrimp , the black skins of trout , the turgid gray of carp , the blush of snapper , the silver-speckled salmon , the camouflaged carapace of live lobsters , their pincers bound with rubber bands , the whole display of creatures newly dead on fields of chipped ice or the surely doomed crawling through greenish tank water left Alan feeling as if he were gazing into another dimension . <p> The expressions on the fish faces , resignation or startle , were strangely calming , outside ordinary time . Round , golden eyes or beady eyes like capers looked back at him through thick glass without seeing or accusing ; indifferent eyes from some magical realm . Sometimes Alan let himself enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gardens of anemone , thrashing and jumping in luminous pools . Other times he identified with the imprisoned lobsters waiting for the hand that would lift them squirming and drop them into the boiling pot . The fish counter was the best show in town . <p> After staring awhile , pretending indifference , Alan would usually push his wagon to Check Out , enjoy the pings of the register , pay his bill , and head home . But on this particular evening Alan stayed too long watching a thug lobster bully a cull . <p> His mind drifted to a dangerous shoal . The thought came to him that his transient , fragile existence was vulnerable to the net , trap , or hook . Worse yet , like those lobster lives , his own life was On Hold . Those dark thoughts made him shiver . He shifted his eyes from the tank and found himself face to face with a fat-bellied salmon that had been propped up on its ice bed in a swimming position . It hovered like a submarine waiting to fire a load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with revenge . Then Alan saw the salmon 's fins wave like fans while its gills seemed to pulsate with the rhythm of a nervous heart . The salmon 's lipless plier mouth snapped open and a deep , salty voice said , " Spawn ! " The command vibrated through him . Alan trembled . The items in his wagon rattled loudly enough so that a woman waiting for a pound of seafood salad jumped back from the counter and glowered . A clerk asked him if anything was wrong . Perplexed and embarrassed , Alan spun his wagon around and headed for refuge among Cookies and Cakes . He walked between walls of donuts , pies , cupcakes , muffins , fudge sticks , chocolate chips , jelly rolls , cinnamon buns , composed himself in that sugary aisle , then headed for the shortest line to escape . <p> Walking to his car , Alan was in a sweat . His forehead gushed water ; he swabbed his cheeks with a handkerchief . That ridiculous voice , a dead salmon 's voice no less ( obviously some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , echoed in his head . " Spawn ! " It was a voice powered by supreme authority . A Five-Star General 's voice . Moses 's voice ordering the Red Sea to split . A voice that impaled like a spike , ruthless as a bathroom mirror . <p> " Spawn ! " Alan replayed the fishy fiat again and again on the ride home , through a restless night , at work the next day . He frightened himself but assumed that the voice would gradually fade , then retreat to where it belonged in some subconscious cave . He 'd planned to work on a new play that evening but he was much too distracted for sustained concentration . The minute he forgot the voice it roared in his ears . So he hooded his typewriter and went downtown to a bar called The Oval Orifice where poets read their latest creations followed by comments from a polyglot audience . <p> When he arrived at the bar the poets were already reading . Alan saw several familiar faces in the crowd , and there were greetings waved back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perched on a stool , and listened to a woman recite a sonnet , coincidentally called Bottom Feeder attacking the absurdity of her devotion to her lover 's penis , gluttonous as an eel . Alan flexed at the eel imagery since it forced his mind into water , but the salmon voice was silent . <p> After some praise and blame from critics in the room , the woman was replaced at the microphone by a young , bearded man in a black suit , white shirt , and bow tie named Irwin Plotnik . A crowd favorite , Plotnik carried a Bible and began his presentation by thumping the book thirteen times . Then he shouted : <p> Lord , they say You work in mysterious ways , <p> They say accept and offer praise , <p> Enough that You promise to amaze . <p> They tell this sheep to bleat and graze <p> On blades of grass like question marks <p> Ignoring the menace of damps and darks , <p> To zip my fly and mend my ways ; <p> Lord , I say fuck Your mysterious ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of supreme exposure , <p> I , IRWIN PLOTNIK , DEMAND FULL DISCLOSURE <p> " Spawn ! Spawn ! Spawn ! " Alan 's head exploded with the eruption of sound . He swallowed what was left of his Chianti , dropped a few bills on the bar , and pushed through applause on his way to the door . Outside , he sucked great draughts of misty air blowing in from the Pacific . In a few minutes , he was joined by Plotnik who came out to smoke the stub of a reefer . Alan acknowledged him with a nod . <p> " I saw you at the bar , Alan . So what did you think ? " <p> " Good poem , Irwin . Disturbing . " <p> " How so ? " <p> " That the lord works in mysterious ways is n't exactly a hot news bulletin . It 's probably the most significant conceit of religion , the foundation for faith . I mean , if it is n't true there 's no hope for hope , no reason for optimism , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I suppose , " Plotnik said , sucking at the diminishing roach . <p> " What I 'm getting at is that your demand for full disclosure is reasonable but dangerous . " <p> " Tough shit . " <p> " Who can say what might be disclosed ? And what would the end of mystery mean to our screwed-up species ? And all you can say is tough shit ? " <p> " What do you want me to say , shmuck ? Why should a deity have the chutzpah to hide inside a Sunday puzzle ? " <p> " Too much disclosure too soon could be catastrophic . Those mysterious ways could be the indirect path to direct communication . Gradual revelation is a concept that .... " <p> " Too mysterious for me , old dude , " Plotnik howled into the fog bank . He pinched the end of his butt and wrapped its remains in a piece of aluminum foil . " That poem was rejected by seven magazines so far . The editors must all be retro pussies like you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar . <p> Alan walked toward no place in particular . Distant fog horns moaned in chorus . Instead of inhabiting the heavy air , some trick of acoustics made their wet music rise from the ground as if the city 's sewers complained . The horns quit suddenly , leaving soggy silence . In that soundless void Alan faced another frightening thought : He considered the possibility that the voice that haunted him could be God 's own voice . <p> Why would the lord speak to Alan Bragle through an iced fish ? Why not ? Just another in a long series of his famous mysterious ways . Was n't the fish an ancient symbol for mystery , probably dating back to amphibious ancestors ? <p> Alan was forced to accept that he might be a worthy candidate for heavenly conversation . He knew it was a crazy idea that belonged in the head of a madman , but a case could be made . He devoted his days to hard labor and his nights to the examination of inner and outer stars . His ambition was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distilling experience into art . He was a good person , not too greedy , who often made joyful noises even in the face of looming chaos . He was warm hearted , appreciative of beauty , sincere and compassionate - no less deserving of special attention than , say , a Fatima or Joan of Arc . For a moment , Alan felt himself glow like a firefly . The wave of elation crested and smashed when he heard the shriek of a police siren , or was it an ambulance on the way to pick up a corpse ? <p> God 's voice ? Alan 's astonishing display of egotism made him giggle . <p> And what if he had been chosen ? Chosen for what ? To " Spawn ! " Some blessing . <p> He 'd learned about the joys of spawning in Junior High . Talk about mysterious ways ; it was the fate of a salmon to leave its freshwater birthplace , swim a zillion miles downstream avoiding every obstacle and predator , find its way to the endless ocean , enjoy a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the height of its power , in the prime of life , to schlep itself back upstream to its nursery , find a mate - Spawn ! - hatch a brood and drop dead from exhaustion . <p> Was the peek-a-boo lord sending Alan Bragle a code message or was it the glass of wine he 'd swallowed on an empty stomach ? Or was he catching the flu , feeling the first burst of fever ? Whatever the source of his misery , Alan knew that someday he could use the experience for a dynamite comedy . Working title : Something Fishy . He tried to shake his head clear of the whole subject but the maneuver failed . Bottom line , was a chilled Chinook that different from a burning bush ? No , this was no passing fancy . Alan began to weep in the street . In his heart of hearts he knew he 'd been marked for suicide , a lobster about to be yanked from the tank by his own hand . He made a fist , half expecting to find his fingers bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could delay his destiny , flail around , hide under his bed for a while , talk to a psychiatrist , read self-help manuals , but ultimately he would be forced to submit to invisible powers . He made a decision . It was best to yield willingly , to preserve some vestige of dignity in the sawtoothed jaws of oblivion ; Alan Bragle decided to swim upstream and " Spawn ! " It struck him as ironic that the tears he wept were salty . One of the lord 's little jokes ? " Full disclosure , my ass , " Alan said to a passing cat , half expecting the cat to twitch its whiskers and answer with some wiseass remark . <p> II <p> On a frigid morning in December , Alan Bragle stood in a tiny wooden hut waiting for the Shell Island Ferry . A few hours earlier he 'd watched great masses of clouds from the window of a Boeing 707 reflect morning sunlight . The clouds seemed thick enough to deflect rogue asteroids , stray comets , or Russian missiles . They formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Jack Kennedy 's death . Hours earlier , Alan saw stars the size of honeydews roll through pitch-black space . Looking down , he browsed a vast sleeping land abandoned except for little enclaves of patterned electric life . Then the sky fragmented into purples , blues , and reds as eastern dawn gained dominance . <p> The redeye from San Francisco was his first flight on a jumbo jet . Twenty years earlier Alan headed West by Greyhound bus , hitchhiking when his money ran out , sacking out in YMCA dormitories that stank of piss , pus , and booze , listening to drunks and drifters wheeze , spit , and fart their way through nightmares , make snotty sounds , scream garbled names like Mary , Joe , Billy , Cherry , Bobby , Harry , Fatty , Betty in the dirty dark . Alan gave each name a face , sometimes even a body . He loved every minute of that trip . He took notes on a yellow pad . <p> Flying back , looking up , looking down , smoking Lucky Strikes , nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars , the dawn , the clouds in memory . Saving his impressions in a notebook made no sense . He was going home to " Spawn ! , " gasp , and go belly-up ; he was beyond the pull of gravity . <p> The plane landed at Idyllwild Airport in Queens . Alan waited at a caddy until his suitcase fell out of a black hole and moved around the silver turntable on the slow-motion journey he called baggage time . He grabbed for the bulging case stuffed with a few shirts , a pair of blue denims , rolled socks , his razor , toothbrush , and comb but mostly with manuscripts and folders he 'd packed for the hell of it . Those pages represented ten years of labor , thousands of hours spent hunched over his Royal Portable , a billion cigarettes , countless epiphanies . Something would be said at his funeral ; better that the text was scripted than left to parents who never liked him much or to some minister mumbling generic praise - better to leave specific instructions for reading choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled a rough draft of sterling excerpts . <p> Next , Alan negotiated a price with a gypsy cabdriver for the trip to the North Fork of Long Island . It was an outrageous luxury but in the long run that made no difference whatsoever . He would be cremated , no frills , his ashes tossed into the Atlantic at no additional expense . The saving over a box and plot would more than pay for his limo . <p> He relaxed against the leather seat of a Lincoln Continental , relishing the ride after so many years of transporting himself in a cramped VW Bug or breaking his overused ass on busses and cable cars . He told himself that , for a serious spawner , getting there was more than half the fun , it was at least fifty-one percent of the fun . <p> Alan had called his folks to tell them the prodigal son was returning . He wondered if they 'd be at the ferry dock to meet him . He 'd also requested that they find his Shell Island High School yearbook if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " required a spawnee , and while he knew that most of the Class of ' 41 was surely accounted for , there might be two or three fertile stragglers desperate enough to show some interest in a brief but productive alliance . <p> To search out a co-conspirator on the mainland was a deadening prospect , uncertain , inconvenient , draining , and expensive . Besides , Alan suspected that if he 'd agreed to sacrifice his seed without complaint , the lord should willingly provide a ready egg or two . If there were a god who cared enough to issue Alan 's spawning orders , that same god would make some effort to participate in the process . <p> Maybe an angel in the form of a frog , chicken , deer , or tree had already talked with a Shell Island lady who anticipated Alan 's arrival . She might be tidying up her house , swallowing oysters , and taking perfumed baths while his chariot gobbled up the miles on the Long Island Expressway . Alan closed his eyes and contemplated the relationship between angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching over him or was this all a grand illusion traceable to faulty synapses ? Who could take the risk of defying his creator ? That would be as stupid as building a nest on the dome of a nuclear reactor . If Alan was a random soul picked out of a hat for some divine testing of the species , what would be the consequences if he rejected The Call ? The whole planet could implode or whirl into a consuming sun . Alan Bragle did n't want to be the cause of that . He liked birds , flowers , baseball , and willowy girls in rain-drenched yellow slickers . Also , it was important to him that a few enlightened readers survive to conjure up his ghost , however long that resurrection might take . For the truly creative , self-interest did n't diminish with death ; death was the beginning of immortality . <p> The gutsy Shell Island Ferry , hardly more than a large toy , banged against half-submerged pilings as it floundered into its berth . One rusty pickup truck drove aboard , its rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... SUMMER NOT . Alan was the only pedestrian passenger . <p> As the boat got underway , Alan looked back at a desolate winter landscape . The bare trees seemed made of ancient bones . It might have been better to " Spawn ! " in spring but that was n't his assigned timetable . He focused on gray water roiled by freezing wind . A shrieking gull flew through the spray , possibly remembering other crossings when summer tourists tossed crumbs over the ferry 's railing . The gull made arcs and loops on a blank page of sky , a flight path that reminded Alan of his first disastrous penmanship lessons . <p> Alan watched the mainland recede as Shell Island rose up from the horizon like a dragon 's back . He felt as if he 'd last seen the island twenty minutes ago , not twenty years , or was it twenty centuries ? That time could telescope in a blink had always puzzled Alan . As the island grew , he thought about sitting in the Shell Island Palace , the movie playhouse that shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy of seven or eight wondering how a film about fighter pilot aces that spanned all of World War I could happen in under two hours . He sensed back then that time was an accordion . Time was no more than a convenient fantasy . There was no time . Ah , but there was . And time had weight ; it was heavy as lead . Did Einstein know that ? <p> Alan sniffed the air . In the past , Shell Island had its own smell , sometimes sweet , sometimes soured by swamp gas . He could n't smell anything on this crossing , and he could see that the landscape had changed . There were many more houses on the heights and along the curving beach , many more piers and jetties . The postcards his mother sent every few months often complained about real estate booms and too much alien traffic . <p> When the ferry docked , Alan quickly spotted his father huddled in a pea coat , hands hidden in deep pockets . Harry Bragle was n't wearing a hat . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , capping an anxious red face , reminded Alan of a melting ice cream sundae at the Yum Yum Shoppe , a shack on Crab Creek that stayed open all year . <p> Was the Yum Yum still there ? Was anything still there ? <p> On the ride to the house , Harry told his son that , since he 'd retired from his job at the hardware store , he 'd made himself and Alan 's mother miserable , so he decided to go back to work . " You wo n't believe this , " his father said , " but Mom and I bought Nibby 's Fish Market . Nibby bought a place down in Florida and he gave us a very good price . So we bought it . " <p> " A fish market ? You bought a fish market ? What do you know about fish ? " <p> " What I do n't know , I 'll learn . What 's to learn ? Nibby introduced me to his suppliers . They deliver the fish , I sell the fish . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mom will handle the cooking . You remember her cooking ? " <p> " I absolutely do , " Alan said , trying . " So , a fish market . " Mysterious ways . <p> " Well , Alan , I 've got to tell you we were surprised as hell when you announced that you were coming home . And , frankly , relieved . We almost wrote you off , kid . We thought you were water under the bridge . What made you homesick ? " Alan knew it was impossible to tell his father he 'd been sent back to " Spawn ! " His mother , maybe , but Harry Bragle , no . He shrugged . <p> " I 'm not exactly sure , Pops , " Alan said . " But if you 're worried about having me around the house for the next millennium , it wo n't happen . After I get my bearings I 'll be out of your way . I 've saved a few bucks . I 'll take a room someplace and think about the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father said . " There are n't many jobs on Shell Island , not in the winter . Things pick up when the 212 's come back . " <p> " You lost me . " <p> " That 's what we call weekenders. 212 's . That 's the Manhattan area code , get my meaning ? So , is it true that San Francisco is fag city ? Well , we 've got our pansies here , too . Nowadays they hold hands in the street . Faggots , dikes , and Jews . That 's where the money is . Jesus H. Christ , what a world . " <p> The Bragle house , a blue cottage with green shutters , was just past the Episcopal Cemetery . His parents had their plots there . They got the last available tract . The frost-speckled cemetery looked comfortable enough . There was something to be said for a satin-lined coffin warmed by heat from Earth 's fiery core and a solid granite tombstone to mark your plot . For citizens of Shell Island , moving to the cemetery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate that continuity . But all things considered , Alan 's choice of cremation and ashes-in-the-sea was more prudent . And the irony : A striped bass that nibbled his dregs might easily end up on ice in Nibby 's Fish Market filleted by Harry Bragle . How mysterious can you get ? <p> " What goes around comes around , " Alan said . <p> " Meaning what ? " <p> " Nothing . I was just thinking . " Alan wished he had Irwin Plotnik 's address to drop him a line about full disclosure . <p> That evening , after finishing a stuffed chicken seasoned with herbs , Alan 's mother produced the high school yearbook he 'd requested . Priscilla Bragle sat next to her son on the sofa while he thumbed through its still-shiny pages , examining the smiling faces of the Class of 1941 . All the graduation pictures showed teeth except his own , the barbered boys with their Clark Gable cool , the gussied girls expectant as June Allyson playing a bride . Alan 's face was knotted in a scowl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother said . " You look so suspicious , Alan , " his mother said . " So angry . " <p> " I was furious . " <p> " About what ? " <p> " I du n no . I think it was because I had no ambition that made any sense . You know I hated high school . Everybody hated me . I hated me . " <p> " How can you say that ? Under your picture they wrote Look out Shakespeare , here comes Alan ! Favorite Song : Stardust . Favorite Film : King Kong . Favorite Book : Action Comics . Favorite Sport : Cynthia Dickinson . That does n't sound very hateful . " <p> " Cynthia Dickinson hated that . She did n't even know I was alive . " <p> " You should have asked her to the prom . " <p> " Who says I did n't ? " <p> " At least you knew you would n't be drafted because of your knee . " Alan 's left knee never healed after he fell off a jungle gym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That knee business did n't exactly make me feel good about myself . Being a card carrying 4F was one of the reasons I ran away from here . I had to find my own war . So , do you ever hear anything about Cynthia ? " <p> " She married a chiropodist . They live around Sayville . " <p> " What about that one ? The one with bangs . Amy Griffing . " <p> " I think she was killed in a car crash . It was tragic . " <p> " Mary Ellen Halahan ? " <p> " I heard she became a nurse . Her family moved off-island years ago . " <p> " Astrid Archer ? The one we called Asteroid ? " <p> " Her first husband died in the Battle of the Bulge . I was told she went to Germany with some Army doctor . I suppose they 're married now . " <p> " Betty Lane ? " <p> " Still here . She married Johnny Silvia . They have five kids . He works for his dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Marsha Karville ; LiIa Loome , Shirley Morris , Nancy Nevins , Jane Oliphant , Patsy Porter , Lana Quint , Estelle Rohling , Rhoda Ston , Yvette Uber , Kathy Vaughn , Virginia Watkins ( there were no Xs ) , Sandra Yodle , Serena Zork . Priscilla Bragle could account for most of the females Alan considered palatable . The ones with juice were all taken , over the rainbow , vanished into their futures . Except for Serena Zork . <p> " Serena ? The chubby one ? So adorable as a child . She 's a waitress down at the Couch Potato . " <p> " Where 's the Couch Potato ? " <p> " Used to be the Quiet Clam , before that , Arnold 's Kitchen ? On Crescent Beach ? We used to go there for pizza ? " <p> " Yeah , yeah , " Alan said . " Lousy pizza , soggy crust . " <p> " Poor Serena never married . She stayed home to take care of her mother who went senile . Dead now . She still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ages ago . I was thinking of offering her a job when we get the restaurant going . Funny you should ask about that one . " <p> Serena Zork . Alan found himself a candidate just before falling through the alphabet . The Yearbook listed her nickname , Rolypoly . Cute cameo face , long brown hair , mountainous breasts , small waist , wide hips , a formidable ass , solid legs , fleshy arms . Favorite song : All of Me . Favorite Film : Gone with the Wind . Favorite Book : Anything by Emily Dickinson . Favorite Sport : Field Hockey . <p> She was good in English , wrote slushy poems . Alan once showed Serena Zork a play he wrote about Clark Kent and Bess Truman . She liked it . He never forgot a wet dream he had about Serena . In the dream she confessed that she was not an ordinary girl , she was part cantaloupe . Filled with seeds . Prophetic ? <p> Harry Bragle came into the room . " I heard you talking about ambition , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . It 's not too late to make something of yourself , kid . Colonel Sanders did n't start Kentucky Fried Chicken until he was in his sixties , so they say . I was thinking , you might want to help us put Nibby 's into shape . The place is falling apart . If you 're ready to work , there 's work to do and you could write your plays at night like sane people who need to make a living . " <p> " Sane people ? " Alan said . <p> " You know what I mean . Regular people . " <p> " He 's still pissed about the psychiatrist , " Alan said . <p> " Please do n't use language like that in front of your mother . I was n't even thinking of your shrink . " <p> " It was n't my idea , " Alan said . " It was the school counselor who sent me . They knew I was depressed . I did n't make much effort to hide it . What was it the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , orally fixated , regressive - a potential ding-dong . " <p> " And I told that witch doctor his diagnosis was a little too fancy , a little too pricey for a Shell Island family , " Harry said . " That shut his face . " <p> " And your father was right , Alan . There was nothing wrong with you except growing pains , " Priscilla said . " Anyhow , it 's water under the bridge . " <p> " Twenty years and he 's still frantic about spending fifteen bucks on that hour . " <p> " Fifteen bucks was fifteen bucks in those days , " Harry said . <p> Later , Alan went walking around his old stomping grounds . Except for a monolithic neo-Victorian house at the end of the street , complete with a tennis court and swimming pool , things were pretty much as he remembered them . <p> He recognized trees , taller and thicker now , and a circle of rocks on an empty lot where he once played Stonehenge . Alan cast himself as the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growls in a squeaky , pre-adolescent voice . He chanted ancient legends and prayed to multiple forest gods asking that his testicles descend in a blast of lightning and crash of thunder . In fact , it took another year before his balls filled with honey ; the transformation was lethargic , but better late than never . <p> Standing in that rock circle , a forty-year-old man filled with nostalgia for a twelve-year-old boy , - " Spawn ! " " Spawn ! " " Spawn ! " - the echoing rumble interrupted his reverie . " I 'm standing here upstream , " Alan growled back . " What 's your hurry ? Cool it . Get off my fucking back . " <p> The next afternoon , at lunchtime , he bicycled down to the Couch Potato for a look at Serena Zork . Before he left , his mother served up blueberry pancakes . It was easier to eat them than explain his plan to sit at one of Serena 's tables , order a hamburger and fries , survey her geography . If she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained a semblance of her ripe sweetness and readiness to laugh , he would reveal himself as the incarnation of Alan Bragle , returned to complete a sacred mission a willing spawner of sound mind and body with a scrotum brimful of ready wrigglers . He would break that news slowly . <p> " Oh my God , Alan Bragle , " Serena said the second Alan walked into the Couch Potato . He was amazed that she recognized him so quickly . It took him longer to recognize his own reflection . The way she 'd phrased her greeting was probably accidental but possibly not insignificant . " Oh my God , it is you . " <p> " Serena Zork , unbelievable . You look exactly the same as you did at Shell Island High . It 's really good to see you . " <p> " I hope I do n't look the same , " Serena said .

Worked for a dry cleaner in Berkeley . Ended up in a place something like this only we catered to the tofu crowd , the stir-fried starry-eyed . And I wrote a few plays that managed to get produced . Like that . " <p> " Me , I stayed on Shell Island , " Serena said . " It just happened that way . " <p> " We have a lot to catch up on . Maybe we can get together some evening . " <p> " That would be nice . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second lunch , he watched Serena move through her waitress routines . For him , the grace of waitresses , especially the ones who worked in all-night diners , was better than classical ballet . If they had the gift of grace . <p> Serena Zork navigated better than she had as a teen . Maybe it was her old breasts that made her seem unbalanced , tilting like a top about to tumble . Now her posture was firm , her manner assured . If her health was good , which Alan planned to find out as discreetly as he could , Serena Zork would make a respectable consort . When she came with his check , he asked if there was anyone in her life . She told him the truth was she had n't dated for years . <p> " The winter guys are , well , you know . The summer guys are , well , you know . That 's all the guys I get to meet . Except for the married ones . Are you married , Alan ? " <p> " No , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hectic what with the job and the writing . I was thinking of sending away for a mail-order bride from the second or third world but postage is so damn expensive . " <p> " I 'm free on Thursdays , " Serena said . " Let me cook you dinner . Nothing elaborate . You bring the wine . We 'll sit around and talk . " <p> " Sounds fine , " Alan said . " Sounds delicious . " <p> " I 'll whip up my famous decaf lasagna . " <p> " As long as no animals are hurt in the process , it 's a done deal . " <p> Alan Bragle 's seduction of Serna Zork , disguised as courtship , proceeded with extreme caution . On their first evening together , after an excellent meal , they listened to Miles Davis LPs filling two decades of gaps and crevices with information edited to reveal enough but not too much about their personal lives . They shared fond memories , confessing innocent crushes and embarrassing pratfalls . Alan found himself telling Serena about his days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close relationship with an Egyptian goddess named Sekhmet and showed him a statuette of that lion-headed lady she kept in her bedroom . <p> " Never heard of her , " Alan said . " Is she on the A-List ? " <p> " Sekhmet has an interesting resume , " Serena said . " She began as a kind of hit man for the gods , knocking off humans who broke faith . The problem was , Sekhmet began to enjoy her work too much , ripping people apart , that sort of thing . She frightened her bosses so they gave her a multiple personality as Hathor , a cow , loving , healing , and nurturing . The idea was to make her more manageable . She still goes around biting and gouging but more gently with an occasional moo . We keep in touch . " <p> " Your guardian angel ? " <p> " We have intimate conversations over flickering candles . You did n't know I was the spiritual type ? " <p> " You believe in mysterious ways ? " <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could say that . Just when everything begins to seem like it 's made out of plastic , I have some synchronous experience or hear about something eerie that brings back the chill . I 'm pretty sure there 's something out there . " <p> " The Druid and the Goddess . Some pair of pagans , you and me . " <p> Alan gave Serena a kiss on the cheek before he left . <p> Pedaling home , he assessed his progress . He was pretty sure that he would soon " Spawn ! " but it would have to be spontaneous , unexpected . He doubted Serena was on the pill but she might insist on finding her diaphragm or that he wear a condom if sex was on the menu . Passion had to carry Serena past such practical considerations . He sensed that quick kindling would n't be easy with a woman who kept a statue of an Egyptian mafiosa near her bed . <p> Alan had to cope with another concern . He realized , in one of his epiphanies , that successful spawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expired in a gush of bubbles , what would happen to the child he 'd leave behind ? His controlling voice never went beyond issuing its single command . There was never any discussion about bringing up baby . <p> Was Serena Zork the kind to face the claustrophobic world of Shell Island as a single mother ? Would a woman who had her breasts reduced have any hesitation about finding a defrocked doctor ready to terminate an unwanted pregnancy ? And if she had the child - a boy ? - a girl ? - who would pay for its upbringing ? Alan planned to leave her some money but a waitress at the Couch Potato could n't make enough in tips to afford pediatricians , sitters , and those midget clothes he saw in the windows of kiddie shops . <p> Alan wondered if he should concern himself with such things . Mysterious ways allowed for dismissing the mundane . Pedestrian worries might hold back an Irwin Plotnik but not an orthodox servant of the intangible . Hell , the kid would have to fend for itself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie on the mainland . They did some heavy petting on the ferry coming back . Any question Alan had about her passion was answered ; Serena was hungry for body contact . At her house she invited him in but he declined , making the excuse that he had to be at Nibby 's to supervise a plumber early the next morning . Serena was left hurt and confused . <p> Alan 's voice was outraged . " SPAWN ! " <p> Alan assumed " YOU MISERABLE ANAL RETENTIVE , OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE , ORALLY FIXATED , REGRESSIVE SONOFABITCH followed after his cosmic caller hung up . But he did n't want to die that particular night . He needed at least a few more days to put his affairs in order , arrange his manuscripts , construct a bibliography and leave his parents clear instructions about finding a suitable archive for his output . He did n't want The Collected Works of Alan Bragle ( 1923-1963 ) dumped in the Shell Island garbage pit . His body was one thing , those pages another . The most dedicated producer did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neill . <p> " You can afford to wait a few lousy days , " Alan muttered to a pale Moon . " If the delay costs me points , tant pis . " <p> Three nights later , Alan ran out of excuses , kissed his mother goodbye , shook hands with his father , and went to penetrate Serena Zork . <p> He 'd gotten to like that woman more than he wanted to and could n't help but appreciate her obvious affection . Out of ordinary courtesy , he felt he had to let her in on his little secret before things got out of hand . He did n't want to stick Serena with his corpse in her arms , blaming her pent-up appetite for fucking her lover to death . <p> It was a cold night . Snowflakes dotted the air . Icicles hung like pods from barren trees . Serena had dinner simmering on the stove when Alan arrived . She 'd set up a picnic on a rug near her fireplace . He popped the cork on a bottle of Cliquot Brut and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before he could tell her he had something to tell her , Serena told Alan she had something to tell him . " About making love tonight , " Serena said , " I could be a disaster . I 'm not talking about putting you on the spot , darling . I 'm not asking for commitment . It 's that I 've only had one experience and it was not nice . You know Mr. Ronbork ? " <p> " Ronbork ? The name strikes a chord . " <p> " The English teacher . " <p> " Oh , yes , Ronbork . The one with the wig ? I knew Mr. Ronbork , all right . he nearly flunked me . We argued about Moby-Dick . He said whaleness was .... " <p> " Alan , I 'm trying to tell you something . He raped me . " <p> " Mr. Ronbork ? He raped you ? How ? Where ? " <p> " On his desk . We were going over my paper on ' The Raven . ' I was talking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled up my skirt , tipped me over and did me . He hurt me , Alan . " <p> " That pervert bastard . Did you tell anybody ? " <p> " Tell who ? I was too scared . The only one I told was Sekhmet . She failed me . She did n't tear out Mr. Ronbork 's heart . I went home and took a bath . The water was so hot it nearly took off my skin . I was sore for a week . " <p> " You poor child . " Alan held her . He stroked her hair . <p> " I guess Mr. Ronbork wanted more , " Serena said . " Anyhow , he gave me an A. " <p> " Do n't trivialize , do n't demean the trauma , " Alan said . " That pervert should have been barbecued . Serena , I 'm so sorry you had to go through .... " " What I 'm worried about is the whole idea of having sex . I want to lie naked with you , Alan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It was a long , long time ago . A long time ago , " Alan said . " Think about how many spins the Earth has taken since then . Think about what unspeakable horrors so many people have gone through in this bloody century . You 're a survivor , Serena . I 'm sure of that . I know you 'll be fine . We can face the Ronbork troll together . " <p> Alan Bragle felt Serena Zork go limp . He kissed her lips while he unbuttoned her blouse , fumbled with her bra strap , cupped her breasts . <p> She kicked off her shoes , undid her belt buckle , slid out of her slacks , bent her legs , pulled off her socks , let Alan take off her wispy panties . " Love me , " Serena said . " I 'll try to be welcoming . " <p> Before he had the chance to explain his imminent death , Alan Bragle found himself spawning . When he entered Serena his eyes flashed bolts of colored light , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumpkin , his brain dissolved to sparks . He felt Serena flex at first , she tightened , then she yielded to him , thrust against him , bit at his tongue , moaned into his ear , rolled him on her belly , wrapped him in her legs , sucked his mouth dry . He felt himself burst , flow into her , his lava poured down a craggy mountain and into a steaming sea . <p> Then he died . <p> " Are you happy now ? " were his last and final words . <p> " So happy , " Serena said . " Thank you . " <p> Alan nearly said " I was n't talking to you , dear , " but stopped himself . Something was very wrong . He was still alive . The icy San Francisco salmon swam through his mind . " Spawn ! " Give up the ghost . That was the arrangement , practically a contract . But here was Alan Bragle , naked 011 the floor with Serena Zork , famished for dinner and grateful when she filled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was pregnant . Alan spoke to his hidden mentor many times . " Should n't I be elsewhere ? In a parallel universe , another dimension , some version of what 's called heaven or hell ? Was n't there some kind of agreement , an implied promise ? So why am I still vertical ? " he got no answer but when he asked Serena to marry him , all things considered , she answered , " Yes ! " <p> They eloped to Montauk and spent a brief honeymoon in a motel near the lighthouse that marks the continent 's boundary . Eight months later , Serena Zork delivered a chubby son they named Adam Thor . Serena 's obstetrician told Alan that for her age the birthing went remarkably well . <p> Alan worked at Nibby 's Seafood Oasis alongside his wife . The restaurant thrived what with Priscilla Bragle 's cooking . When Adam Thor was two , he was introduced to a new sibling , Eve Sekhmet Bragle , pink and plump . <p> A year later , the Bragles had another daughter , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after that , a second son , Alan , Jr . <p> Every night , Alan Bragle kissed his wife , wished her sweet dreams , then made a silent try at contacting the source of all mystery . He always asked the same question : " Should n't I be elsewhere ? In a parallel universe , another dimension , some version of what 's called heaven or hell ? Was n't there some kind of agreement , an implied promise ? " Nobody home , nothing but silence . <p> When the twentieth century ended , Alan and Serena sold their house and moved to a new retirement complex on the far side of Shell Island . The place provided meals , medical care , and visiting entertainment . Their four children were scattered across the country , all doing reasonably well . In their turn , they 'd produced twelve grandchildren who enjoyed visiting the island on major holidays and during summer vacations . <p> A bit uncomfortable in the twenty-first century , Alan Bragle made the best of old age . Serena was kept busy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shell Island 's past , Alan stayed involved with the local theater group where he read his plays and gave gratuitous criticism to others . Except for restless nights when he dreamed of gossamer liaisons like his overnight with The Perk ( who had to be nearly sixty , playing character parts if she 'd stayed with her career ) his sleep was undisturbed . He endured a triple bypass , a knee and two hip replacements . Each time he woke from anesthesia , he said , " There must be some mistake . " <p> On the night of Alan 's death , just hours before he crossed over , Serena opened a can of King Oscars and made a sardine sandwich for her husband . As a loving gesture , she cut a slice of onion for him to slip between the sardines and the lettuce . She hated the smell of onions but Alan often baited her with , " it 's raw onion that makes a sandwich a sandwich , " and she felt in a giving mood . <p> When Serena offered her sacrifice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his onion . One of the sardines raised its oily body as if it still had a head and said to Alan Bragle , " You are some kind of asshole , if you do n't mind my saying so . Never , I mean never , listen to a supermarket salmon from a fish farm . They 're congenital liars , the bunch of them . ' Spawn ! ' That 's what they tell you to do . They never left the tank , never spawned in their unnatural lives . They play a vicarious game . Whatever they say , forget about it . " <p> Then the sardine lay down among its fellows and Alan ate it . <p> Of course , Alan Bragle gave the sardine no credibility . He wrote it off as a crank , finished his dinner , lingered over a cup of tea , kissed Serena goodnight , and went to bed . <p> Later , when he felt his soul separate from his body and rise like a helicopter , at first he was frightened , then furious , then resigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . Drifting through the Milky Way , Alan listened for a firm , if apologetic , voice saying , " Mr. Bragle , I think I can explain . " <p> Sidebar
