<p> No longer a badge of otherness , body art has become a mainstream movement . Twenty years ago , when tattooing started its amazing crossover , culture-watchers wrote it off as a glib fad . But instead of fading into an embarrassing relic from the deeply unhip ' 80s , tattooing is stronger than ever . <p> The Bay Area keeps more than 100 tattoo studios in ink . Tattoo conventions are held where the demographics skew far wider than the stereotypic cross section of skinheads , bikers , ex-cons and gang members . Tattoo art is dynamic and diverse , with styles that range from Japanese to tribal , from bold designs that borrow from graffiti art to somber " tribute tattoos " commemorating a dead parent , grandparent or lover . <p> Even police officers are turning themselves into canvases for living art and self-expression : In 2003 , Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton decided that tattoos project a negative image and ordered his 9,000-member force to cover tattoos while on duty . Police departments in San Diego and Houston followed in kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disappearance of the gender divide . In his 1980 memoir , " Chapters From an Autobiography , " the late **25;6549;TOOLONG Samuel M. Steward described a journal he maintained for eight years for sex researcher Alfred Kinsey . " I noted 32 motivations for getting tattooed , " he wrote , " of which 25 were sexual in whole or part . <p> " Of the group with sexual motivations , by far the most heavily weighted reason for getting one was an assertion of masculine status , so much so that early on I made a sign for my shop which said : ' Depressed ? Downhearted ? A good tattoo may make you feel like a man again . ' " <p> Tell that to Angelina Jolie , Janet Jackson and the thousands of Bay Area women who choose tattoos as a means of self-expression . In most local tattoo studios , women constitute 50 percent of the clientele . <p> We spoke with two local tattoo artists about the enduring body-art phenomenon and asked them to describe the psychological nuances of tattooing and the nuts and bolts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue , San Francisco 's first all-female tattoo studio , in 1995 . At 16th and Guerrero , it draws a clientele of lesbians , gay men and Mission District hipsters . Black &; Blue does n't deal exclusively in any tattoo idiom , yet Stern is partial to the tribal style  --  solid black ink ; bold , curving designs with Asian and Pacific Island influences  --  popularized by Filipino American tattoo artist Leo Zulueta . <p> Stern lives in Petaluma with her female partner and their children . A native of Bremen , Germany , she says she grew up thinking tattoos were tacky . But at 25 she changed her mind . <p> " What happened to me is , I got tattooed . And that 's how I imagined me doing it . I always wanted to be an artist , and I never really could see how I could do that and make money . Also , a lot of artists are very lonely : You do n't work with people , you 're just on your own . And that 's not the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole idea of working with people and being able to make money with your art was amazing . Also , I 'm interested in the body and tattooing is more of a sculpture to me than placing pictures . One of the things I work with is the shape of a body : I want things to look like they 've always been there  --  or they 've grown out of the body  --  as opposed to there 's something stuck onto it . <p> " The worst reason to get a tattoo is to keep a lover . It 's usually the beginning of the end , almost always jinxing the whole thing . Some people have been together for 20 years and they get each other 's names , and two years later they come in and want to get a cover-up . So I like to do a consultation first . <p> " Removing tattoos costs a lot more than having them applied and it 's more painful . I actually do n't know the price , but I 've heard it 's like three to 10 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some colors that are harder to remove . With every removal I 've ever seen , I did n't understand why the person did it because you could tell it was a removed tattoo and there was scarring . <p> " I would n't tattoo something I do n't believe in . Anything right wing or anything Nazi related , especially because I 'm German . I think that some stuff has gotten watered down like the Iron Cross . It comes up everywhere  --  a logo for this company , a logo for that company  --  and I would n't tattoo that . For me , since I 'm German , I have a responsibility to be aware of those so I 'm not willing to do that . Same thing with swastikas . <p> " It 's hard to say which body part is the most painful to get tattooed because it 's different for everybody . A lot of people really hate being tattooed on groins . I have a lot of clients who love it . From my own experience , I would say rib cage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tattoo insides of hands and feet , penises . <p> " Penises are really hard to tattoo because you have nothing to stretch them over . Usually you stretch over the bone . I actually tattooed a penis , probably eight or nine years ago , and it was totally fine . The energy was right and it was this really young guy and not problematic at all . But then for some reason it was out in the open that I was the ' penis tattooer , ' and I had all these horrible people come to me , wanting me to tattoo their peckers , which was n't too exciting . <p> " People get emotional during a tattoo . I tell them whatever happens it 's OK . Especially guys  --  they 're not supposed to cry . People go through all sorts of stuff sometimes , which is not necessarily to do with the pain but just with release . ... Breathing is important , food . It 's really good to come in with a full stomach . A lot of the time when people go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wiggling a little  --  and a lot of the time the ink does n't go in the body . <p> " What I do is , I have them go through this visualization where they 'll take in only the ink and block out the whole idea of having pain and being uncomfortable . I 'll say , ' You 're not the light source , you 're just the extension cord . ' So basically it 's just letting it flow . " <p> Dominic Scalzo started tattooing in his native Brooklyn when he was 14 " as a means of support . " Twenty-nine years later , he runs Dragon 's Lair , a tattoo shop on a busy section of MacArthur Boulevard in East Oakland where his clientele is 70 to 75 percent African American . <p> The walls and shelves in Dragon 's Lair reflect Scalzo 's passions for tribal masks , skull and skeleton art , drag racing and the late Dale Earnhardt . Signs throughout the store sharply discourage cell phone use or any patron foolish enough to think he 'll get a tattoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ages 7 to 25 , and two grandsons . He met his wife , Tonya , when she came into his shop for a tattoo seven years ago . <p> " When I did my first tattoo , I actually thought it was quite funny that somebody could make a living at it . To me , it was just too easy . Like , ' What 's the catch , you know ? ' But now , after so many years and coming in contact with so many other people that do tattoos , literally thousands , I realized there is a big difference between a tattoo artist and a tattooist . A tattoo artist can create and can freehand right onto the skin . A tattooist can only do prearranged artwork . <p> " I would say the worst reasons anyone would want a tattoo would be out of anger or hatred : a relationship gone bad , putting something on that 's derogatory . I do n't like to do anything that promotes the use of drugs or alcohol or drug paraphernalia . No racial slur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is a bitch . ' I look at that as , like , maybe feeding into low self-esteem . I mean , you ca n't think highly of yourself if you 're wearing a tattoo that says , ' So-and-so 's a bitch . ' <p> " Among the 18-to-21 age group , the percentage who come in wanting to cover up a boyfriend 's name ( on an existing tattoo ) is extremely high . And some of them , hey , they go right up into their 30s getting the cover-ups too  --  11 , 12 , 14 times . You know what I 'm saying ? Kinda like keeping a tally . With girls , it 's difficult to do a cute , bright , colorful piece of artwork within the parameters of the cover-up . <p> " The conversations you have while people are getting a tattoo , I would imagine , are the same conversation they would have in , like , hair shops and nail shops . Boyfriends , relationships , family this , this one in jail or that one just got killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection of that : a lot of ' Rest in Peace , ' a lot of ' In Loving Memory of ... ' <p> " In terms of style , I try to conform to what 's going on . And styles change every few years . Like this New School style that everybody is crazin ' and ravin ' about  --  it 's just an advanced step on , like the graffiti that we were doing as kids . I do wildlife , realism . I can do surrealism , tribal . There are some guys who specialize and if I have a customer and I think they can do a faster , better job , I 'll refer them . <p> " This is something to be taken very seriously , you know , this business . Because everything we do is permanent , everything we do . The artwork is permanent on the person , our actions are permanent in the public eye , OK ? Because we are definitely scrutinized because we 're the oddity . ' Look at that guy !
