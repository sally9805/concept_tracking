Rand Lee has been working steadily on a fantasy novel entitled Morningfall and says he is nearing completion on it . In the interim , he manages to write a new story every two or three years . His first story for this young century is part of his ongoing sf series about interactions between humans and the alien D ' /fy . These stories may seem a bit challenging at first , but they 're well worth the initial effort . <p> 1 . IN THE ARMS OF HIS FATHER , the boy Gather dreams of his mother , and wakes in a cold yearning sweat to find himself strangling on his sibling 's tail . Somehow , during sleepwatch , Flet/jejno/Lilyo/fy has managed to turn itself completely around in the cradle of their father 's arms ; and Flet 's tail , seeking anchorage , has found Cather 's throat . Struggling for breath , tearing ineffectually with his nailless hands at the encircling appendage , Cather acknowledges rather bitterly that he has always envied Flet its tail , since he has none . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Cather has seen coal , in the mineral stores ) , streaked with oxygenated aortal blue . When combed out , it makes a great fluffy fan capable of covering Cather 's entire chest ; braided by Cather 's nimble five-fingered hands , it can put out an eye . Help ! Help ! Cather cries , using the secondary vocal cords in his upper chest , for his primary vocal cords are not much use with their airway squeezed flat . But Cather is part Human , and his D ' /fy secondaries are poor flabby things as yet ; the subsonics they generate are weak . Flet , deep asleep , does not hear . As the red mist rises before his eyes , Cather wonders if everybody will be sorry when he is gone ; if Ship will declare a Mourning ; if the septet to which Cather and Flet have belonged since their births will elect to disband rather than seek a replacement for him ; if his lifeless body will be placed beside that of his mother in cryostorage on Firstdeck . So entertained is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( from a distance , through the gathering mist , and as though they belong to someone else ) that his arms and legs are flailing wildly ; and when his right foot , driven by his powerful D ' /fy leg-muscles , finds the bank of sensitive scent-glands lining the inside of his sib 's left thigh , Cather barely feels the impact . Flet roars in its sleep , beginning to rouse . Its tail whips away from Cather 's neck , hardens , sharpens , then slashes him across the face , opening his cheek . " Stop ! Stop ! " gasps Cather . Bubbles of his hybrid blood mist the air of the nest . " Stop , thou great turd ! Thou wilt slay me sure ! " For Flet 's young First Cycler brain is still thrashing up through the six stages of D ' /fy sleep , and until its higher centers engage , its defensiveoffensive subroutines will not cease . Again its tail whips out , raking Cather 's left shoulder . Cather screams with both sets of vocal cords , punches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father " Father " help ! " help ! All at once the webbing-sac collapses , and the children bounce into the freefall of the vast crechedeck . Flailing , they carom off one another , neighboring nest-membranes , and the floor before Ship , alerted by the presence of Cather 's misted blood , extrudes restraints to snag and immobilize them . And by this time their father , **26;923;TOOLONG , is winging its way toward them from across the cabin . Chiseled silver face glaring down at them from its muscular neck , mane of glorious silver D ' /fy hair floating out around its rippled shoulders , Maknado 's disappointment is immense , its sorrow even more so , and its shame greatest of all . " For this wert thou Awakened , child of warriors ? " Maknado roars to an ashen-eared Flet . " To smear thy nest-sib into nutrient paste with thy great extravagant tail ? Welll Explain thyself , for surely we must explain in our turn to all those whose slumber is disturbed by thy perturbations ! " Flet , now fully awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobs incoherently , misting the air with the tears from its huge eyes , leaking reconciliation-triggers from every silver-furred pore . But Maknado is implacable . " Thou hast grown overproud , y'Flet , " it growls , " overproud of thy strength and swiftness , and clearly thou hast thought these things enough . But more there is to the warrior 's way than these things . The warrior must bear all things in discipline . The warrior must consider all things in serenity . The warrior must temper all actions with due regard for conservation of resources inner and outer . Even slumbering , the warrior must not lose mindfulness . And to lose mindfulness while in the Family nest ! " It bows its magnificent head , and its flow of words ceases . As Flet launches into the long , convoluted apology required by D ' /fy etiquette ( Hundred and Third Attitude , The Youth Ashamed ) , Cather considers confessing the groin-kick that has been his contribution to the melee , but he decides he is enjoying his sibling 's discomfiture far too much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been increasingly spoiled by a deep and piercing envy : of its tail ; of its strength ; of its perfect control over its secondary vocal cords ; of its linking-cells . Cather , too , possesses linking-cells , engineered of altered D ' /fy DNA , the same linking-cells that Flet has used to make its tail-tip a razor and Maknado has employed to wrap their sleeping-sac and grow freefall wings . But Cather , though the same age as Flet and , like him , a First Cycler , has no conscious control yet over his linking-cells ; and since he is unique among the Family , nobody knows what percentage of pure D ' /fy linking cell combinations they may be capable of . Different , he thinks bitterly . I 'm Different , that 's all . For all we know I 'll be a Firster for the rest of my life . Flet has stopped talking . " Peace , now , y'Flet , " Maknado is saying . " Ordered thou art , now ; ordered and in proper relationship , " the Manafut term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **49;951;TOOLONG . " Embrace now thy sib in loving harmony . " Which Flet does , moistly , while in his secret heart Cather burns . 2 . EXCERPT FROM THE PRIVATE JOURNAL OF DAME CATHERIN CASTLETON , AUGUST 30 , 2162 , 13:05 PM GMT : Apparently the D ' /fy have solved the problems they were having with the amino acid balance in its nutrient environment , for the child now grows like a weed in Maknado 's pseudowomb . I find myself curiously interested in the little creature 's progress . I do n't know why I should be ; there is almost nothing of me in it - just a few scraps of genetic material , harvested from my ossified ovaries . But really , it is so ugly it is endearing . It looks like a pig that has been crossed with a fetal pony that has been crossed with my son , Tony , whom fortunately I shall never have to endure the sight of again . In fact , it looks very much like the Tenniel illustration of the pig-baby in Alice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human when it is finished than it does at present , but I am not sure that that will be an improvement . Maknado is still worried for it . Although the child possesses the full range of D ' /fy scent-glands , it seems its smells are still wrong , a terrible problem : What if Ship refuses to recognize the creature as one of its own , and decides to abort the entire procedure ? Ship can do this , apparently . It nearly overrode the D ' /fy decision to initiate contact with Earth last century , and it came perilously close to refusing entry to our boarding party when the First Expedition finally docked after eight years in space . Though Veveto/hahanno/Unesta/fy , who convinced Ship to accept our Net apparatus , assures me Ship has grown to like Humans much better than it did when it first met us . The D ' /fy speak of Ship as though it were alive ; but then , they speak of everything as though it were alive . " Bloody bunch of star-abos , " Elaine Goolagong used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Human female on the First Expedition I could stand . Her mother was the one who deciphered the original D ' /fy radio band transmission , and Elaine always labored in the shadow of her fame . I was so sorry to hear that she had killed herself . I wonder if the child will think of me after I am dead . Since I will probably not live to witness the baby 's first birthday , none of this should matter to me . Yet I find that it does , terribly . This child will be the first Human being in history to understand what it is like to be a D ' /fy from the inside , and it is carrying my genes , mine . The WHO is demanding that the D ' /fy permit a psych team to visit me from Earth . The ostensible reason is my welfare ; His Majesty 's government has been most concerned for their newly damed Castleton . The real reason is that they suspect we are up to something and want to find out what it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump the team for information about Human child psychology , I expect , since there is only so much they can learn from observing me , retarded adolescent though I am . I managed to avoid social contact with the Ninth and Tenth Expeditions , and the D ' /fy were kind enough to keep them well away from this part of Ship ; I do not know what my hosts told my fellow-Humans , but at any rate nobody sent for me . I suspect it is because the expedition-members were all fixated on the new venture , this Interspecies Contact Station they and the D ' /fy are planning to build halfway between Earth and Rigel Kent . This time around , however , I will not be able to avoid the psych squad . I wonder if I am up to it . Have I forgotten how to lie ? The D ' /fy can not lie , and I have not had social intercourse with a fully Human being in over a year . Lord put a watch over my mouth , Big Ben if possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder ? We do not know this any more than we know what kind of D ' /fy it will be . It has the linking-cells , even the ones in its brain ; God knows what that makes it capable of . But it does not have them everywhere , as the true D ' /fy do . Its bones are far less rich in them than its internal organs . This worries me . What little the D ' /fy have confirmed about their life-cycles - I have identified seven , so far - has made it obvious that each involves considerable morphological change . Will the child , with its less flexible skull and skeleton , be able to adapt to them without repeated surgeries ? Perhaps I have not mentioned that we have decided its initial gender . I did n't want it to have any gender at all , but the D ' /fy , having studied psych texts , firmly vetoed this ; androgynes die young in Human cultures . Instead they have grown it into a herm , possessing fully functional male and female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as a male-identificant , since the hormonal surges and aggression responses of Human male adolescents approximate those experienced by D ' /fy First Cyclers . It will also have a sibling , with whom it is already bonding in utero . This was a surprise ; the D ' /fy were keeping it from me , a birthday present . Ah , God . Whatever the child is , it will not be like us . I have perhaps eight Earth-months left to live . How I wish I were not dying . I bullied my way onto the First Expedition , pulling every string I had , determined , with my stupid poet 's idealism , to rescue the greatest event in the life of the Human race from the banality of pure scientific objectivity . How obnoxious I was to poor Brasilia in my aesthetic fervor . " We have a visual on them ! " she said excitedly , as I stepped off the shuttle at Woomera . " They 're humanoid , just as their maths said they would be . And furred , with large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey - " " No ! No ! " I think I actually raised my hands in horror . " Do n't bias me ! I wish to encounter them with an absolutely fresh gaze ! " " But I 've made them sound like chimpanzees . " I waved her away . So she gave up , and simply ushered me into the ready room , where Thresk ( I know now it was Thresk ) , conversing via timelagged , black-and-white skiplink with the WHO umpty-umps , was projected on the wall-size Netscreen . I stood stock still , overcome with wonder at the harsh , almost masculine facial planes ; at the wide brow and high forehead ; at the short , light facial fur exploding in a glorious gleaming silver lion 's mane about the vast shoulders ; at the wide flat Negroid nose , binostrilled like ours ; at the wide , upthrusting , concave , batlike ears ; at the thin-lipped , toothless , hard-gummed mouth ; no visible Adam 's apple . And the hands : six-fingered , each finger nailless , slightly spatulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion . But , oh ! The eyes ! Large indeed - double the size of a Human 's - and as such offputting had it not been for their deep , mild , receptive ( rather than penetrating ) intelligence . White-balled like ours , triply irised in gradations of gold , yet slightly milky ( I thought of cataracts , only later learning of the D ' /fy 's transparent triple eyelids ) . Long , almost feminine eyelashes ; no eyebrows . It saw me , then , and it smiled at me . Not with its lips , of course ; only Firsters possess the modified snarl-grimace we call a smile . With those eyes . I burst into tears , of course , only barely conscious of the indulgent looks on the faces of the scientists , government shills , and military personnel standing round about . They , whom in my pseudointellectual arrogance I had dismissed as cretins sight unseen , knew all about it , having each experienced the same reaction herself . Maknado had promised me the child would have D ' /fy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , else . 3 . ON THE GAMINGFLOOR On the Gamingfloor , the Firster septets from Cather 's crechehall are training . None of them have morphed into Seconders yet , though there is an electricity in the air that portends Change soon ; and Ship has turned up the gravities , so everybody gets a chance to run around and enjoy the push and thrust of muscles under pressure . In Flet 's septet , Flet has been assigned to play Union of Opposites with Cather , because they are sibs and Cather is Different . Before they begin , Flet passes on to Cather - with the pride of recent acquisition the knowledge that null-gee , though fun for sleeping and sex and flying , is bad for the bones . " Bones are the semirigid structures within us to which our muscles attach , " says Flet . " We all have them . They show us that we come from planets , long ago ; and that space is not our first home . Null-gee makes the bone-stuff weak . Too weak for planetiall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit Earth , an enthusiasm that Cather , fearing his own Humanness , does not share . " Am I three watches from the womb ? " snaps Cather . " Begin the Opposition ! " " Let it begin , then . " They circle one another , locking gazes . Playful mockery in its eyes , Flet purses its lips in a D ' /fy grin . " Thou art small , my sib , " it taunts , " but thou art not wise . " First Challenge : verbal . " Thou art not small , my sib , but thou thinkest thyself wise , " retorts Cather , glaring . Second Challenge . " Thou art smaller than I , but not as wise as I. " Third Challenge . A mild look , to match its tone . Insolent , insolent , thinks Cather . " Thy smallest part is not as wise as my largest part . " Fourth Challenge , Cather . " My largest part is wiser than thy smallest part . " Fifth Challenge , Flet . It begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take first strike . Cather bounds forward , kicking out as he does so . Flet is gone , just like that . Cather whirls . Humming , Flet shoves its brother backward : once , twice , thrice , using its superior reach to stay just outside Cather 's swing-range . " Strike , sib , strike ! " it calls . " Strike ! Why art thou not striking ? " Cather grabs Flet by the left arm and drops back , pulling Flet slightly off-balance . Then he wraps his legs around Flet 's middle and unloads a barrage of curses from his sematophores . The stench engulfs them both . Gasping , Flet pulls away , nictitating membranes sliding into place over its sensitive eyes . Cather , extra lids already in place , hoots gasping laughter in his turn . He has been wheedling extra sulphur from Ship for several weeks , preparing for this moment . " Thou scum-sucking turdling ! " cries Flet in mock-anger . The stench is really a masterpiece . " Yield thyself , sib ! " shouts Cather . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never ! " cries his sib , and leaps . And spreads new wings . And flies . " What ? What ? " Cather cries ( Sa ? Sa ? ejaculatory form of sy , First Stage Manafut linking-particle denoting wonder , horror , amazement , amusement , depending on context , tonals , and vowel-shift ) . Gamesward claps its four big hands and skirmishes cease all over the field . Mouths open ; long , furred necks crane . The shout goes up first from Cather and Flet 's five crechemates : clever Frelkip , sweet Mestipa , deft Bynjyk , randy Hlelever , agemates all , known to Cather in sight and smell and sound and muscle-feel and limb-writhe and heartbeat since his first knowing : " y'Flet ! y'Flet ! y'Flet ! " It is taken up by the next septet , dancing Devved 's ; and the next , led by Vessesh the ( normally ) silent ; and the next , and the next . " y'Flet ! y'Flet ! y'Flet ! " The Gamingfloor resounds . And above it , floating in silvered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzing in golden clouds around it , Flet/jejno/Lilyo/fy - now Flet/jejno/Dyeuye/fy - soars . Flet 's braided tail , tip newly healed , nearly clunks Cather on the head on its way to the floor . Then Mestipa explodes in mane , rainbowed , oceanic . Hlelever writhes , flowers erupting from throat and chest and armpits . Bynjyk splits down the middle , silver fur fusing into turquoise scales , then puffing back into fur again as the new Seconder exerts its new-coined will . All across the Gamingfloor , warrior Firsters are shuddering with their Change into Seconder metamorphs , tails falling off right and left , while Gamesward races amongst them , embracing , reassuring , shouting encouragement . All , that is , except Cather , who lost his tail long ago . And Cather flees , shrieking , in utterly hominid despair . 4 . EXCERPT FROM THE PRIVATE JOURNAL OF DAME CATHERIN CASTLETON , 12 JUNE , 2163 , 1:05 AM GMT : They brought it in person to me today as I lay here in my coffin . I am entirely paralyzed now , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though thanks to Ship , there is no pain , only a floating feeling . That , and an occasional intolerable urge to scratch my nose . Ship feeds me intravenously , and feeds me well . I am never hungry or thirsty . Still , I dream of chocolate , and wish I could taste it one more time before oblivion . Impossible , of course ; my stomach , as such , succumbed to the supercancer long ago . But still . The Twentieth Expedition said good-bye earlier . They do not know about the child , of course . One by one they filed in , like Irishmen at a wake . Captain Roos-Jensen was very chatty . Construction on Concord Station has begun . The D ' /fy have opened their starlogs to the linguists , and Roos-Jensen 's voice shook with delight as she described what little they had come to find out . " Dozens of civilizations , " she told me . " Scores of them . Maybe thousands . Hard to say ; the logs are n't strictly scientific , if you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Ah , how well I know . The D ' /fy are dreamers , first and foremost . They have been dreaming since the dawn of time , dreaming of us , it seems , of creatures like us , that is to say , of creatures like themselves . In their flight from their masters , millennia ago , they were flying not only away , but also flying toward . Us . And they have always known it . I am sorry for the child , I find , having gazed face to face upon its nearly supernatural ugliness ( excepting its eyes - always excepting its glorious angel eyes ) . Oh , it is alien enough for the Net , I suppose , should the Net ever discover its-his-existence . It possesses a vestigial tail , which they tell me will soon drop off , much sooner than it will for its D ' /fy sibling ; finger- and toe-webbing ; little purple gills , which they say will be fully functional into adulthood ; strange shiny skin , like a porpoise 's only already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the D ' /fy should do something about those ears ! ) ; and that big cranium , already no doubt aswim with strange hybrid thoughts . The baby is fully conscious at less than one Shipday old . They did n't have to tell me that ; I could see the look on its face when it poked its head out from Maknado 's translucent carrying pouch and took a gander at me for the first time . It looked as horrified as I felt . Poor Maknado seemed tired . It would not let me see the sib . They have all gone , now , so that my final visitor may come to me and I may die in peace . It is a great relief . I had always read that loved ones hold back a dying person , and it is true . If I were D ' /fy , my agemates would devour me as I died ; but Ship fears , I think , that I would give Her indigestion , so She is going to display me in a time-anomaly for future generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who knows ? I might be back . What little I have been able to comprehend of D ' /fy theology appears to resemble some of the tenets of Buddhism and Hinduism : everything is change ; peace is acceptance , not resistance ; we never die , but are merely transformed , all that twaddle . Acceptance indeed ! Was it acceptance that drove them into space ? They are anything but passive . The D ' /fy never lie , they claim ; to call a D ' /fy a liar is the greatest imaginable insult : it drives them wild . But no one has thought to ask them if they always tell the truth . I see my executioner has come at last , so I will end this recording . My son , my daughter , whatever you are , when you view this in your elder days , have pity on your poor mother . I did not do my best for you ; I did not think of you at all , really , but only of my need for union with these blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than myself and my wretched Humanity . So do not grieve for me , or wish you had known me , or love me . I am quite sure , now , that I have never loved you . For you are too Human , my dear . It is not your alienness that fills me with disgust when I looked upon you , but your Humanity . Whatever strange blood courses now through your hybrid veins , you bear the stamp , the unmistakable stamp , of the sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve . And I hate everything Human . Ah . How nice of you to drop by . I have been expecting you . Let 's get it done . Castleton out . 5 . IN THE WELL Anguished , afraid , Gather falls down the nullgrav well . I will never Change ; never ! he thinks . Never ! Never ! The well is clogged as usual with the traffic of those Awake : Lilyoy Firsters , from crechehalls other than his own ( one big youngling , glands bulging , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Like Flet ! Like Flet ! ) , new to their swift , compact bodies , shapeshifting as they plunge just for the joy of it ; a gaggle of Nuplastay Thirder empaths with pain on their faces , deep in recall of their past incarnations ; Unestay Fourthers , geometrician-specialists by the sound of it , arguing math-politics with hands , mouths , and scent-glands ; and every now and then , a quiet Tymytay Fifther teacher like Thresk , falling with dignity . No Shoryay hermits , but this does not surprise him ; Sixthers rarely use the well . Nor do the Yryey , of course . Seventh Cyclers , the Smallest Ones , ancient D ' /fy in their final life-Change , do not normally make visits to the creche areas , or use the well , or the tubs , or the groves , or the common grounds , or the rutpits . They do not break bread with the community , or cast their songs through the scent network binding the Family together both Awake and Asleep . He has never seen an Yry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father and Thresk , and they will not speak of them . ( Yry from yr , a particle indicating throughness , aboveness , beyondness ; plus y , self ; in plural , - yey , i.e. , those-set-apart-from-Us . ) When once Cather had asked his parent Maknado what the Yryey did all Cycle , Maknado had replied , " Remake the world " ( Vee'y , All-That-Is , ste'ste'olelet , present indicative of stely , to build , to construct , to grow on ) . Which had told Gather precisely nothing . " Not-theres , " Gather 's sib Flet has called them , there being whispers in the ranks , " those who dwell in the deepest core of Ship and never venture forth . " There was a time when Gather could not have imagined what it was like to be one of them , to be so set apart from everyone else . Yet now , Cather , falling , finds himself thinking of the Yryey , and an enormous sadness possesses him . His eyes , leaking tears , attract nanos which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelids . ( Nothing on Ship is wasted . ) Oh , Flet ! he thinks . How beautiful thou art with the high air in thy wings ! Thou art lost to me , now , lost ; thy form , so sweet to me ; thy voice , so familiar ; thy silly stupid fond ways - all will be Changed , with those of our agemates , and I will be alone in the creche . It is an unbearable thought ; unsupportable ; and for the first time in his short life Gather conceives of suicide , an act for which no word exists in Manafut at all . A Thirder , brimming with empathy , catches at his arm ; Cather pulls away savagely , spins into a burly Fourther , stammers his pardon , grabs a passing servo , yells one unheard-of command to it , and nearly has his arm jerked from its socket as the servo responds to the urgency in his voice and drags him , streaking , downwell . From the scarlet of the Firster level shaft he passes into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the deep and Dreaming emerald of Fourther . The crowds shift ( fewer Firsters , then some , then none but he ) , jerk away from the acid keening of his sematophores . Clots of nanos melt like mist , penetrated by the swiftness of his descent . By the time he and the servo reach the turquoise of Fifther level , all Ship knows that he alone of all Maknado 's creche has not Changed into a fluid-bodied seconder . There are no crowds here ; Fifthers do not use the Well . In the dim blue silence the servo , gibbering ultrasonics , finally manages to assert its self-preservation subroutines , slapping filters over its scent-intakes and braking their descent . No ! Gather shrieks in sematophore-talk . No ! No ! The servo shudders one last time , then its machine will dissolves . They fall faster . He half-expects crowds of Fifthers to emerge from their habitat-bays , surround him , stop him by sheer weight of numbers ; but nothing happens : only the silent fall down the near-empty shaft , while the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass into the country of the Sixer teachers , Ship acts . Too late Cather sees the vast wide net of webbing , stretching below him in the shadows . He and the servo impact it at such velocity that they are nearly crushed by the sides of the tunnel their momentum makes of it ; then it closes around them , and they are caught fast , their kinetic energy instantly absorbed , his limbs wrapped and stilled . The servo squawks once . And there they hang in the indigo dimness . For a long time nothing else happens . Gather wonders briefly if Ship will decide he is more trouble than he is worth , and order him ejected into space , lest his recycled hybrid flesh prove contaminating to those who would consume it . But no nanos appear to neutralize his scent ; no tymytay materialize to soothe and lecture him ; no Thresk taps him on the shoulder with soft-faced concern . Slowly his anguish banks , and an incomprehensible calm comes over him . His eyes , far keener than a Human 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient shaft are free here of the kiosks and niches and artworks and squatter-bubbles that cake the upper commerce-levels ; here they are bare to their original surfaces , though much scarred and pitted . As his gaze sweeps the side of the shaft , he realizes with a start that the scars on the walls are not random . There are patterns in them . They are words , child . From everywhere the voice seems to come ; Cather gasps , twists in the webbing , sniffs , listens , then , startled , gawks . For floating in the dimness not a wing 's distance from him , floating where nothing had been floating moments previously , is the smallest D ' /fy he has ever seen . It is half his size , translucent , lit by a glow from within ; he can look into its body and trace the organs , the shadow of a skeleton , memories of fur . Wings above it has , and wings below , and seven faces , not just one . And by this he knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have come to him . Look at the words , child . Hovering , it points its many hands . Read them , and speak what thou readest . He looks , and despairs . Above , below , around him the great walls stretch , their markings branching , interweaving , chill . " Smallest Ones , I can not read them , " he whispers miserably . " I am too Human . " Nay , child . Thou art just Human enough . Whereupon the Yry reaches out its hands , reaches out and into his skull , and softly turns it on . Light explodes within him , racing down the track of his spine like the fires all Shipborn dread . His head turns to knives , crystalline , dismayed , and each knife is a word . His ears burn as the linking-cells in his brain remold his timpani . His thighs run like rivers , sematophore-profligate . His throat throbs , then widens with a jerk of writhing muscle-fibers . Suddenly it is as though he has spent his life deaf and voiceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves and valleys and pits of voicesong and scentsong , voices the existence of which he has never before even suspected , and he can hear and smell them all . For the wall-markings speak : interweaving arms , legs , tails ; gesticulating hands ; hooting laughter ; rumbling subsonics of staggering complexity ; song-hums of piercing beauty , prismatic fur colors , bank upon bank of luscious , lambent scent . He can hear and smell and understand them all , and oh joy ! He can speak them all : histories , mythologies , sciences , visions ; slave-chants from the Homeworld days ; Diaspora genealogies , Vevbrota war-chants , hero-tales from the Reformation Era ; love-songs from the world-seeding period ; all the long yearning of a race of wanderers , seeking creatures just like itself . And he sings , in all four modes of Manafut at once : Mother ! Word-knower ! Thou art ray wings ! Comprehending at last the shape his Change has taken . 6 . NETCOM TRANSMISSION , PRIVATE , BEN BRINKER , EXOPSYCHOLOGIST , TWENTY-NINTH EXPEDITION PSYCH ASSESSMENT TEAM , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 15 JUNE , 2181 , 11:34 A.M. GMT : I met the child today , Len . The D ' /fy parent , Maknado , selected me the moment I stepped from the Commerce Level airlock . I was embarrassed as hell ; we 're a team , after all , and I 'm very near to being the junior member . I thought at first it was a mistake . So did Olafsdottir . But the servo that came buzzing up was quite emphatic . After sniffing all our armpits it directed me , in perfect English , to follow it . When Olafsdottir protested , it politely told her to shut up and return to the docking bay with the rest of the team . Then it repeated , " Follow me , please , " and we set out together . I felt very small and alone . Sweetheart , the Ship is tremendous , mind-boggling , a planet ; seven planets , actually , layered like strata . An enormous humming dance of a city . I ca n't begin to describe how thrilled I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mom 's big dream for me . The servo led me through the Human compound ( now in disassembly , since we 're all being moved to Concord Station ) , then down a corridor lush with plant growth into a small bay where the child stood waiting , flanked by two of the D ' /fy . The smaller of the two , who had extremely beautiful eyes and what I might call a slightly feminine or maternal presence , introduced itself as **26;1002;TOOLONG , the child 's alien parent . The larger of the purebred D ' /fy introduced itself as Flet/jejno/Dyenye/fy , Maknado 's other offspring . It had a booming voice and big muscles , quite a solid and concrete presence , but I could have sworn when I first laid eyes on it that it had six fingers on each hand . Later , however , I noticed that it had only five . ( I must remember that size-values among the D ' /fy are precisely opposite of those among most Human societies , smaller size being a sign of physiological and spiritual maturation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hybrid was the last to speak , first in English , introducing itself as **34;1030;TOOLONG , its lithe arms moving as adroitly as those of its parent and sibling . Then ( to my delight ) it launched into a welcoming speech in Middle English ( I did not recognize the text and it may have been an original composition ) , closing ( by this time my jaw had dropped ) with an exquisite haiku in Early West Saxon ! Lenny , how it knew that primitive English forms are my hobby I have no idea . It has no teeth , by the way , just those baleen-like structures the D ' /fy use for chewing food . No visible genitals , either , though it assured me , without the slightest show of embarrassment , that it possesses fully functional sets of both male and female Human organs , plus the full complement of Damanakippith/fy sematophores , which I could not see through its fur . It is subtly , disturbingly Human . One can see in its angular face the sensitivity of its Human DNA-donor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , in the curve of its neck , the color of its irises , and the humor that lingers around the edges of its Human-lipped mouth . But the shape of its head , the nimbus of mane , the wide shoulders and chest , and the back-jointed knees are pure D ' /fy . Two-legged centaurs , Olafsdottir calls them , which makes no sense until you see them up close . I was instantly taken by Cather 's voice . all the D ' /fy I 've met have attractive voices , rich in subvocals and mellifluously nuanced , but Cather 's is enthralling beyond words to describe . At the mere sound of it I felt myself moving into an undefinable emotional space , something like the peacefulness I feel after really great sex with you . Thank God I 'll be seeing you at Concord Station next week . I 've had raging erections since I first arrived here . Even Olafsdottir is affected by it ; she goes around with a permanently red face . Note possible hypnotic influences here , pheromonally enhanced . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't trigger a response in Humans at all . ) There 's something about this child , Cather , whom I am trained to make my study for the rest of my life . As its mother was speaker for all Humanity to the D ' /fy , so Gather will speak for the D ' /fy to all Humanity . And oh my good God , Lenny , how he speaks to me . I 'm frightened . Ben out . <p>
