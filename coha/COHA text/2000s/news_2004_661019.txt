<p> Each summer as 120-degree heat shimmers silver waves across the Mojave Desert , residents of this inferno crank the thermostat down . Air-conditioner compressors and fan motors often run 24-hours a day and for weeks on end . <p> The problem is that many air conditioners in this torrid zone are huge power hogs . Which puts Steve Bouman in an unusual position . As head of energy efficiency programs for Mohave Electric , a small power cooperative based in Bullhead City , Ariz. , he 's got a front-row seat to one of the biggest campaigns for energy efficiency the nation has undertaken in years : high-efficiency air conditioning . <p> With the new plan , the United States should be able to keep cool while keeping energy consumption under control . Without it , the nation by 2020 would have to build more than 80 new power plants , creating about as much carbon annually as 3 million cars , according to one estimate . And it comes from a Republican administration , following a court battle in which it sought weaker standards . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy in April announced that all central home units ( which use the lion 's share of power , compared to just 12 percent for window units ) sold in the US must achieve a " seasonal energy efficiency ratio " of 13 starting in January 2006 . That 's 30 percent more efficient than today 's minimum standard of 10 SEER . ( The SEER rating is calculated by dividing the total amount of heat removed from the air by the total energy required by the unit . ) <p> Though the standard has n't kicked in yet , manufacturers are racing to revamp production lines now and consumers are beginning to make the switch , starting with hot places like Bullhead City . <p> " We 're not only in the desert , but the hottest part of the desert , " says Mr. Bouman . " We 're about 10 degrees hotter than Phoenix . Still , we have a lot of old-timers here who do n't have AC . It 's 110 to 115 degrees in their homes , but they 're used to it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and they 're becoming more numerous . The region is in the midst of a building boom , fueled by Californians cashing in their pricey real estate to come to the high desert and build one , maybe even two , new homes - renting one out and living in the other . The boom puts Mohave Electric and its 34,000 customers in a quandary . More air conditioners mean more electricity sales but would require buying more costly " peaking power " or , worse , building an expensive new power plant . <p> That 's why Bouman is on the road a lot these days , offering rebates to builders who will install high-efficiency air conditioning - and get others to retrofit homes with high-efficiency air conditioners or heat pumps . Still , energy efficiency can be a tough sell , since many homeowners flee to cooler climes in summer and so are unwilling to invest the hundreds extra to buy a super-efficient air conditioner . <p> Air conditioning uses only about 15.4 percent of all electricity delivered to homes annually , according to the Energy Information Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use all of it in just a few weeks or months - and peak power loads can overstretch generating capacity and overheated power lines , causing blackouts like the one that knocked out power to millions across the eastern United States and Canada last August . <p> Indeed , air conditioning has a critical impact on peak power demand nationwide - as demonstrated in California , where residential and commercial air conditioning can account for up to 30 percent of the total power load during peaks , according to a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study last year . <p> That 's why energy forecasters keep a wary eye on air-conditioning growth . More than 60 million US homes - about 56 percent of the total - had central air conditioning in 2001 , according to an analysis of most recent census data by the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute , representing air-conditioning manufacturers . And that total has grown by some 5 million homes a year over the past decade - up from 39.3 million homes and a 42.2 percent share of all homes in 1991 . Nearly 90 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air-conditioning efficiency has been improving steadily since the 1970s energy crisis focused attention on power consumption . Homes are far more efficient and better insulated - and heating and cooling machinery is far more efficient . But more homes have air conditioning , and new homes are bigger - negating the gains made by more efficient equipment . <p> " We 've had this situation where air- conditioning equipment has been getting more efficient , yet new homes are getting bigger - everything is supersized - so the result is you have more area to cool , " says Andrew deLaski , executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project , a Boston-based organization supported by a coalition of environmental and consumer groups , states , and utilities . <p> Power use for home air conditioning had been projected to rise 13 percent between 2002 and 2025 - without the new standards . That 's modest compared with faster growing residential uses like personal computers , cell phone chargers , and other standby power energy " vampires , " as President Bush has called them . <p> Yet because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scarier than energy vampires and so must be kept under control , says Jonathan Koomey , a Lawrence Berkeley scientist who analyzes residential power use . <p> " It 's true that power demand for residential cooling is growing at a moderate pace , " he says . " But it 's also true that air conditioning will be proportionally more important than other end uses because of the sort of impact it has on peak power demand . " <p> By implementing the new standards , the nation would cut peak electric demand by 41,500 megawatts by 2020 and carbon emissions by some 7 million metric tons per year , according to an analysis by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy ( ACEEE ) in Washington , an energy watchdog . That peak demand equals 83 500-megawatt power plants . <p> The standards are also projected to save consumers $ 3.4 billion on their electricity bills through 2020 , the group says . <p> " These new standards for air conditioners represent a huge improvement in efficiency , with a lot of savings for consumers and less air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're talking a big improvement in efficiency - and that 's going to have a major impact . " <p> Some manufacturers have been steadily pushing the technological envelope on efficient air conditioners for some time . <p> Sitting in his perfectly chilled office in steamy Tyler , Texas , Greg Walters spends a lot of time pondering cool ideas like : What 's the most energy-efficient air conditioner my company can build ? <p> Over a recent two-year period , Mr. Walters led an elite product-development team at Trane , a major air-conditioner manufacturer , in hot pursuit of the holy grail of air conditioners - a central-air unit for homes that would be 100 percent more energy efficient than anything the DOE currently requires . <p> Not surprisingly , the resulting Trane XL19i is pricey - a high-tech rocket ship among residential air conditioners that can cost up to 2.5 times a similar conventional unit . Despite its cost , its efficiency makes it popular even in cooler regions like New England , company officials say . <p> Yet for the nation 's Sun Belt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated to use up to 95 percent less power than the government 's air-conditioning energy standard . It may not be quite like putting a man on the moon , but the marriage of next-generation compressors , heat exchangers , coolant , and motor was plenty tough . " We had to use every resource we had to do it , absolutely , " Walters recalls . <p> So far , the XL19i is selling well , he says . Sales of other manufacturers ' super-high-efficiency models are also reportedly strong in the hottest regions of the country - Florida , Georgia , Texas , California - where air conditioners run around the clock . Rival Lennox Industries sells a 19.2 SEER unit . Tim Thorson , the senior product manager for cooling at Lennox , says its new model is selling well - even in Alaska . <p> " Certain people want not only the most efficient machine , but the one that 's best at dealing with humidity and air quality , " Mr. Thorson says . <p> Even in Oconomowoc , Wis. , for example , about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range , says Jason Punzel , service and sales manager at Pat 's Heating and Air Conditioning . " It does get pretty warm up here for a couple of months . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
