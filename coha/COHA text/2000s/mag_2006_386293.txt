Last Sunday , I went to the 9 o'clock Mass . Alone . This is n't the way it was supposed to be . We are part of a Catholic community , and Mass is said to be a celebration . These days Mass still represents many good things for me , but celebration is n't one of them . What happened ? My children grew up . Some of them still go to Mass , sometimes with me on that rare , really good Sunday . But some of them never go . The day just passes , and we do n't even exchange any words about it . Three out of the four-they range in age from 18 to 25-are usually at home , too . Come Sunday morning , there 's this " thing " we just do n't talk about . I 'm not sure I know a single Catholic family of my acquaintance that does n't experience this sadness to one extent or another . Too many young people , baptized and educated and raised as Catholics-who still vehemently claim to be believers-just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with their parents . Barely 40 percent of baptized , selfproclaimed Catholics attend Mass in the U.S. on any given weekend . Of that number , less than one third are deemed " young people . " In some inner-city parishes , it 's an event to see anyone under the age of 55 sitting in a pew . Sure , parents still trundle off elementary school-age kids with them , but by the time they reach college , the drop-offbecomes dramatic . Catholic Church membership , overall , is not declining . The influx of mostly Hispanic Catholic immigrants has seen to that . It is church participation that seems to be endangered . You can chalk that up to laziness , disaffection , apathy , and a dozen other factors . The results add up to empty pews . Millions of American Catholic parents with children in or approaching their very late teens or early 20s are going through a similar experience in which their children are exploring the boundaries and the permanence of their faith . The parents I used to sit next to on gray folding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exact same dual crisis-of the soul and the family . My friends Joe and Pat Burton live just a couple parishes away from us . They 've been forced to accept the reality of grown children making their own choices , too . " If they 're at home , I sort of know what they 're up to , " says Pat , " but they all have lived away at school at one point or another , or still do . There 's no way for me to really be sure what happens then . " When they 'd call home , she would ask if they 'd gone to Mass . " ' Sure , Mom . " That was all I ever heard . Then I 'd say , " OK . What was the gospel about ? " Then there 'd be this silence . Finally I 'd hear , " The Prodigal Son . " Once , I told my son , " It ca n't be the Prodigal Son every other week , honey . ' " Although they carA control what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their parents ' roof , it 's a different matter . " At home , if they do n't get up for Mass , I get them up . I do n't care how late they were out the night before , " says Pat . " And do n't imagine it is n't a fight to get them to go with Joe and me when they come home for breaks or vacation . But I know it 's a fight worth having . " Other parents disagree . " We have plenty of other things to fight and argue about , " explains Mary Kelly of New Jersey , " I know my children are basically good kids . This is a stage . It 's rebellion , in a quiet way , and a life passage . This is how they show their independence from their father and me . It will pass . It may take until they think about having children of their own , but I know it 's not a permanent rejection of the values they grew up with . " Growing up is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on seeing my children all together at Mass are on the largely social occasions of weddings and funerals . That 's something at least , but it does very little to make me feel better or any less culpable . Rightly or wrongly , I still assume responsibility for their actions , spiritual and otherwise . Not that they want me to . In fact , they hate it when I do this . It robs them of their " grown-upness . " Sometimes I sit in the pew by myself now , glancing longingly at the younger families in which the kids are still little enough to be brought to Mass . What a sweet pleasure that was-getting them dressed , settling them in the car , and making them behave at Mass . That used to be us . Then , they grew up on me . Pat Burton also sees the situation as an issue of growing up . " They make choices . We all have to make choices for ourselves . I ca n't live their lives for them . I know what we taught them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their decision , " she says . There is nothing particularly new about growing up and making decisions on one 's own . Other generations have been through this as well . Rosa Burns , now well into her 80s , spent most of her life in the tough , struggling coal towns of upstate Pennsylvania , where faith was an unquestioning and accepting belief . There were certain things you did not take for granted . " It just makes me mad to see these smart , well-educated young people taking it all so for granted . They should be proud to practice their faith . That 's what they were taught-to be Catholics , " she says . " I saw it then , too . People forgetting who they are . But they come back . If you 're raised the right way , that stays with you . " Ultimately Pat Burton must believe her children will come back as well . " I refuse to believe it has anything to do with their fundamental faith , " she says . " What happens is they let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priorities . It 's part of growing up , growing up spiritually , too , and that 's different for everybody . My husband really lets it bother him . He gets mad . I 'm trying to have patience and pray for them . " Tapping into creative solutions As a Catholic parent , I anticipated all sorts of problems and challenges and trials as our children got older , but I never prepared for this . Not too many-if any-parents from our generation have . We are , for the most part , men and women who spent much of our childhoods in the right-versus-wrong absolutism of the pre-Vatican II church days of faithful obedience under Pope Pius XII . Nothing we learned by rote , from Stations of the Cross every Friday afternoon to marching around the parish church and school for May processions , remotely prepared us for something like this . My brother and I , and my wife and her brothers and sisters would not have even considered not attending Sunday Mass with our parents . Sure there were the occasional exceptions , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends-but not that many . You went to Mass on Sunday . That was it . Some shrewd parishes are taking action in surprisingly innovative ways . Take St. Denis Parish in Havertown , Pennsylvania , just outside Philadelphia , for example . Their fall 2006 parish activities calendar includes St. Denis Theology On Tap for ages 21 and older . This unique , non-church-based event runs regularly in what are called " 4-packs " from 7 to 9 at night . The location is a popular Irish pub that packs in the college and after-work crowd . This is the way they explain it : " Come and discuss our faith , the codes of DaVinci , and much more ! " It 's also promoted via e-mail . One of the organizers told me , " If we ca n't bring these young adults into church , then we decided to try to go where they will show up , at McGillicuddy 's Pub . It 's not the same thing as taking the Mass to them , but it is taking a spiritual message to them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my children here and there about Mass attendance . For the most part , though , I guess my wife and I have gone through whatever stages you go through in confronting a situation like this : lecturing them , screaming at them , threatening them , pleading with them , and ultimately becoming resigned to sitting alone in the pew . I have attempted to remove all the fighting and arguing about Mass from our lives , after having been reassured in the dark certainty of the confessional that Mass is never supposed to become a divisive factor in the life of a family . Time is much too short . We have had this pointed out to us by more than one sympathetic priest . As one of them said to me , " Driving them away from the family is never going to bring them back to church . Your example , whether they choose to follow it now or later , is still the thing that counts the most . " Many parents in my position draw some very definitive lines . For Mary Kelly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . " What they do or do n't do now is their decision , " she says . " But once they decide to get married and bring children into this world , the ceremony better be in a Catholic church , and if they put up any kick about baptizing the children and raising them as Catholics , I 'll baptize them myself and really begin to butt in . " When asked about taking a pass on Mass , my children and some of their friends are quite vocal about their reasons for not going : * " The homily makes no sense ; who does he think he is talking to ? Not to me. " * " We never missed with you and Mom . Our quota 's filled . " * " It just does n't feel the same anymore ; it 's not like it was when we were little . " * " I prayed so hard for fill in the blank , and look what happened . What 's the use ? " * " I have to get up too early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . " * " I pray every night . Do n't worry about it . " * " I do n't need to be inside some building to talk to Jesus . " And so it goes . Some of the excuses do have a twisted logic to them , but that 's hardly the point . Sunday Mass is still Sunday Mass , and to me missing on purpose is still an old-time sin . Joe Burton , Pat 's husband , sees this as part of a larger issue . " When the schools and the theologians and the whole society downplay the concept of sin , this should n't be all that surprising , I guess . " He grew up at the very end of that pre-Vatican II era . " These kids ca n't conceive of themselves actually being in a state of sin , even with missing Mass . I 'm all for getting rid of the guilt we grew up with , but now it 's totally unbalanced . Personal responsibility should still count for something . " Is being good enough ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , compassionate people ? " A woman in a situation nearly identical to ours recently posed this question to my wife and me . I do n't think she has ever missed a Sunday Mass in her life . It is with a sense of relief and pride that I can readily answer this friend that , yes , indeed , our kids are good , caring , very kind , and sensitive people . Maybe that should be enough . I do know that Gen X , Gen Y , and the even younger kids who will soon be reaching their 20s will continue to make up their own minds , regardless of anything their parents tell them . Mary Kelly may have the best perspective of all . " We can love our children and try to guide them and keep them out of trouble . But it 's not our job to judge them , not even as their parents . That 's up to God . And all we can do is ask God to help them . " I plan to keep on doing just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ourselves . I ca n't live their lives for them . I know what we taught them . But in the end , it has to be their decision . " Sidebar " Driving them away from the family is never going to bring them back to church . Your example is still the thing that counts the most .
