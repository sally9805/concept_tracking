<p> While the Bush administration is dispatching another top envoy  --  this time Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte  --  to deliver another strong message to the Sudanese government about the killing in the Darfur region , critics say the diplomacy is allowing Sudan to play for time as the death toll mounts . <p> The administration has been trying to come up with a way to make good on repeated threats that the United States will hold President Omar Hassan al-Bashir accountable for the violence in Darfur , where 200,000 people have been killed and more than 2.5 million displaced . <p> But even now , Democrats are demanding a plan to address the Darfur crisis , and suggesting their own proposals , including one to impose a no-flight zone over Darfur , and another to authorize American states to divest from foreign companies invested in Sudan . <p> Bush administration officials said last month that they were fed up and ready to impose new sanctions against Sudan , including restrictions on companies that do business there in American dollars . Andrew S. Natsios , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress that the administration was also considering travel bans on some Sudanese officials , and confiscating the savings accounts of Sudanese politicians connected with the government-backed Arab militias , called the janjaweed . <p> So far , Mr. Bashir has yet to yield in response to a demand from the United States that Sudan permit a United Nations peacekeeping force to help beleaguered African Union troops stop the militias from raping and killing unarmed civilians . <p> Administration officials said that an angry President Bush personally ordered up the new sanctions . It was Mr. Bush who told the General Assembly last fall that the credibility of the United Nations was at stake in Darfur . <p> But after hearing from United Nations envoys that the organization wants more time for diplomacy , the State Department said last week that Mr. Negroponte was heading to Sudan . Administration officials have billed the trip as one last chance to try to get Mr. Bashir to allow a United Nations peacekeeping force . <p> It remains unclear what Mr. Negroponte can accomplish that a succession of administration officials to Sudan 's capital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow at the Center for American Progress , said Mr. Bashir was stalling . " If Khartoum is true to form , the government will offer something that sounds real but means nothing in order to buy more time , " said Ms. Smith , an Africa adviser to former President Bill Clinton . <p> " How many bites of the apple does Khartoum get ? " Ms. Smith said . " There 's plenty of evidence to suggest that Khartoum is calculating on the fact that when we say , ' this is it , ' we do n't mean it . " <p> Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , Democrat of Delaware , has summoned Mr. Natsios to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a hearing on Wednesday . The news release on the hearing includes a derisive heading . " Topic : Darfur , " it says . " A ' Plan B ' to Stop Genocide ? " <p> State Department officials last year threatened an unspecified " Plan B " by Jan. 1 if Mr. Bashir did not agree to the U.N . force , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration officials say their own version of Plan B would include the United States travel ban and financial sanctions . In addition , the United States and Britain will try to push the United Nations Security Council into imposing sanctions against Sudan . So far , the United Nations has proved more recalcitrant on cracking down on Mr. Bashir , in part because China , which has extensive business ties to Sudan and generally dislikes the use of sanctions , has blocked multilateral action . <p> American and British officials say that they are now getting close to trying to force the issue at the Security Council , and may try to push for a vote . Britain has now taken over the chairmanship of the Security Council from South Africa , and the United States is next in line after Britain . <p> But Bush administration officials have promised action before and come up short . On Aug. 31 last year , Jendayi Frazer , the State Department 's top Africa official , after meeting with Sudanese government officials , said she was " very confident that ultimately they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Sept. 19 , President Bush gave his speech at the General Assembly . <p> " If the Sudanese government does not approve the peacekeeping force quickly , the U.N . must act , " he said . <p> A week later , in a speech , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that if the Sudanese government " continues waging war against its own citizens , challenging the African Union , undermining the peacekeeping force , and threatening the international community , then the regime in Khartoum will be held responsible , and it alone will bear the consequences of its actions . " <p> Now , more than six months later , there is still no United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur . <p> Sudan 's government says the violence has been exaggerated for political reasons . <p> In agreements signed last year in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , and Abuja , Nigeria , Mr. Bashir appeared to accept the deployment of United Nations troops , only to back away . The same thing happened this year ; Mr. Bashir agreed to an interim " heavy support " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and logistics support . <p> But then , in a long letter to Ban Ki-moon , the United Nations secretary general , on March 9 , Mr. Bashir asked to reopen that agreement . Mr. Ban protested that the Sudanese president was reneging , and Western officials said any reworking of the pact would delay a peacekeeping force until the start of 2008 . <p> The Associated Press reported Tuesday that during further talks in Addis Ababa , the Ethiopian capital , United Nations and Sudanese officials had reached agreement on some elements to beef up the peacekeeping force during meetings on Monday , but that additional issues remained . Bush administration officials said they were not aware that such an accord had been reached . <p> Congressional Democrats , backed by some Republicans , have introduced a flurry of bills . In one proposal , Senator Richard J. Durbin , Democrat of Illinois , introduced a bill in March that would authorize states to divest from foreign companies invested in Sudan . Several states have passed such laws , but a federal judge in February struck down an Illinois law @ @ @
