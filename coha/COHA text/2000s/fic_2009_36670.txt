Maggie , you 've got to be kidding ... do you want to kill me ? " Lucy Binger tried to stare down her best friend , but it was no use . <p> Maggie Messina had already settled in to her furniture moving stance  --  knees bent , jaw set , a determined grip on the far end of an antique love seat . <p> " Come on , Lucy . You can do this . " When that coaxing tone failed , she said , " It 's the absolute last time , I promise . " <p> Lucy shot her a dark look , then finally took hold of her end and hoisted the couch up . Taking the high road , she thought , by not harping on the fact that they 'd moved this particular piece of furniture around the shop three times , each trip reportedly the last . <p> " I owe you one , " Maggie said . <p> " You owe me a few , " Lucy replied with a grunt . <p> " Absolutely ... watch the molding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway while Lucy hung on to the other side for dear life . <p> Lucy was trying hard not to destroy the decor , but angling the couch around the coral-colored walls , tall armoires , and baskets brimming with yarn was no mean feat . <p> Maggie 's knitting shop , the Black Sheep , covered the first floor of a meticulously restored Victorian , the kind real-estate brokers might call " a jewel box . " Lucy knew that was just a clever way of saying the rooms were small and tight , designed for diminutive , nineteenth-century folk , but these days more suited to retail space . <p> Finally , they reached the corner Maggie had staked out as the sofa 's latest landing strip . Or close enough , Lucy decided . She dropped her end , then collapsed on the cushions , her long legs dangling over one side . <p> " Okay , furniture is set . How about the fireworks ? " Lucy turned her head and caught Maggie 's eye . " Do n't you need a permit for that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little carried away . But Cara 's practically famous . It 's a big deal for me , having her here . I 'm expecting a full house . Did I tell you ? " <p> Lucy smiled and nodded . Maggie had told her . A few times . <p> " So Cara was a student of yours , right ? " Lucy folded one arm under her head . " When was that again ? " <p> " Almost ten years ago . " Maggie sat on an armchair near the love seat and rubbed the back of her neck . " She went to college in New York after high school , the Fashion Institute of Technology . " <p> " Did she stay in touch ? " <p> " Oh , a little . When her first book came out , I sent her a note and she wrote back . She 'd returned to Boston by then and was writing for Knitting Now ! Cara comes back to town fairly often to see her family . She stopped in to say hello one day and mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I asked if she 'd give a talk here and she agreed . Pretty good for me , " Maggie added . " Her publisher is sending her out to five or six cities . Bookshops and the big arts and crafts chain stores . " <p> " That is a coup . You must have been one of her favorite teachers . " <p> " Maybe . " Maggie 's tone was modest , but Lucy knew she 'd been very popular with students . Maggie not only looked half her age , but had the kind of energy and outlook that would always make her seem young . <p> Maggie had left teaching four years ago , after her husband , Bill , had died . She 'd always talked about opening a knitting shop some far-off day , perhaps when she retired . But at that low point in her life , she needed a new plan to pull her through and did n't see any reason to put off her heart 's desire . <p> " Cara was one of those kids who hung out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged her , I guess . I had a feeling she 'd do something with herself in the real world . " <p> Lucy was n't sure if the wondrous world of knitting had that much overlap with the real world . But she knew what Maggie meant and Cara Newhouse was clearly a bona fide success in both realms . <p> Felting Fever , the book Cara would sign tomorrow , was her second in less than two years . Her first , Ready , Set , Knit ! , had turned out to be one of the bestselling titles for novice knitters ever . All before Cara had even hit thirty . <p> Slouching toward thirty-three , with no national book tours penciled into her datebook , Lucy knew she was a little jealous . <p> " I 'm not sure if I 'm allowed to say , but Cara might have her own TV show soon . " Maggie picked up a fringed couch pillow that had slipped overboard and slapped it back into shape . " Some producer type is coming tomorrow to tape her demonstration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually be on TV , " Maggie clarified . " But the Plum Harbor Times is sending a reporter . We could make the front page . " <p> " I bet you will , " Lucy agreed . Cara 's appearance would be good publicity for the shop . It did n't take much to appear above the fold in the Plum Harbor Times . The pages of the local paper were filled with blurry photos and fluffy articles about student groups , Scout troops , and Rotary Club members honored for canned food drives and other good deeds . Town trustees debated passionately about traffic lights , trapping raccoons , or keeping skateboarders off Main Street . <p> The truth was , truly bad things rarely happened in Plum Harbor . It was just that kind of place . When Lucy and her sister Ellen visited their aunt Laura in the summers all through childhood , Lucy had accepted that fact without question . Now that she was an adult and living here full-time  --  at least , trying it out for a while  --  the happily out-of-synch atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were striving to be on the cutting edge of trends and fashion , Dare to Be Dull could easily be Plum Harbor 's village motto . <p> Lucy had never found living in Boston particularly difficult , except the year her marriage to Eric underwent a meltdown  --  and that could have happened anywhere . Boston was only about an hour and a half away , sometimes two with traffic , but it might as well have been another galaxy . Some hardy souls made the daily commute , but too few to consider the area a bona fide suburb . And it was n't a summer destination any longer , either . It was something in between , what people called an ex-burb , which was why Lucy liked it . <p> " Anything left on your list ? " Lucy really did n't want to move a muscle , but felt obliged to ask . <p> " I think we 're finished , thanks . " <p> Maggie rose and headed for a table that held stacks of Cara 's new book . She began to unpack more copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a long tablecloth . <p> Maggie was almost ten years older , but Lucy sometimes found her friend 's energy level downright annoying . Lucy teased her about slugging down Red Bull on the sly , but they both knew Maggie was too much of a health food freak for that lapse . Maggie was obviously part border collie , restless and cranky unless she had a productive job to do . <p> Maggie hummed while arranging the books on the table . Lucy glanced at her watch , then closed her eyes . It was almost seven . She could n't believe it . She 'd dropped by the shop around three , just to see how things were going , and had found Maggie totally overwhelmed . Lucy had rarely seen her in a true panic about anything , but that afternoon , her dear pal had been about to unravel . Lucy did n't have the heart to desert her . <p> That was the trouble with working at home and being your own boss , Lucy had noticed . She was too easily distracted . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even housework distracted her , and that was saying something . <p> Some days , she practically tied herself to her desk chair , then ended up roaming the Internet instead of working . Answering eG ? ? mails , checking her horoscope or pseudo-news items . " Stars Without Makeup " was always amusing , and , on a certain level , a deep comfort . <p> Of course , she had to check out her favorite knitting bloggers , like the Yarn Harlot . Then there was always knitting itself , the perfect distraction from work because you were doing something productive . <p> Lucy was still a neophyte knitter , but she was definitely hooked . Polishing off a few rows when she got stuck in some graphic design dilemma cleared her head and settled her mood . As for hanging out at the Black Sheep , the shop was her home away from home . Once inside the door of the cozy knitters ' haven , it was easy to lose track of time . <p> Phoebe Meyer , a college student who worked part-time for Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveniently escaped the set-up marathon at about four . Phoebe had classes on Thursday afternoon , but would be back soon . The others would be here any minute , too . <p> It was almost time for their group 's weekly knitting night . <p> They 'd all told Maggie they should skip tonight 's meeting as she had enough to do . But Maggie insisted . Since the group had formed over a year ago , they 'd rarely missed , traveling from house to house , holding it here at the shop . <p> Tonight was Maggie 's turn and Lucy had a feeling Maggie would be better off with the distracting , relaxing presence of her knitting friends than hanging out there alone , fussing over the book display and cookie trays . <p> The knitting group had first met right here , in the Black Sheep , at one of Maggie 's beginner classes last summer . There had simply been good chemistry and a true connection between them  --  five women at different stages in life , with different occupations but similar interests . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands of yarn and unwieldily sets of needles . <p> By the time Maggie 's course was over , they knew a knit stitch from a purl , how to read a pattern , and repair a yarn over . They had also come to know one another , stitch by stitch , creating an intricate , unique pattern of friendship . Ending their knitting nights together seemed unthinkable . It seemed like just the beginning . <p> Lucy thought of the knitting club as a night out with gal pals ... without the pomegranate martinis . They were known to share a good bottle of chardonnay or pinot noir from time to time , though , along with something tasty to eat . <p> Mini-quiche and green salad were on the menu tonight , a preview of the finger food Maggie would serve tomorrow . Maggie had popped a cookie sheet into the oven a short time ago and the warm buttery smell made Lucy 's stomach growl , though she was too tired to get up and sneak a taste test . <p> The shop door opened and Dana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . A row of chairs blocked her path . <p> " Maggie , what have you done to this place ? " <p> " You mean you like it , right ? " Maggie glanced at Dana briefly , then turned back to the book display . <p> " Absolutely . It looks great . " Dana wove a path through the chairs in the other direction , and smiled down at Lucy . " Have you been here all afternoon schlepping folding chairs ? " <p> " Just about , " Lucy admitted . She sat up and rubbed the small of her back . <p> " What a pal you are . " <p> " I 'm not sure ' pal ' is the word I 'd use at the moment , " Lucy replied . <p> Dana smiled , and slipped off her coat . She dropped it on the love seat , along with a duffel-shaped tote with long leather handles she used as her knitting bag . " Something smells yummy . Did you guys cook , too ? " <p> " Mini-quiche , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a ton for tomorrow . She had a few dozen to spare . " <p> " Sounds good to me . I 'll make some coffee . " <p> Dana headed for the storeroom , which had once been a kitchen and still had all the basic equipment . Lucy followed and watched as she set up the coffeemaker . <p> As usual , Dana looked smart and professional in a brown tweed suit and cashmere sweater . A psychologist with a busy practice , she had an office a few blocks down Main Street . She also had hours on staff at a local hospital clinic . She often stopped in at the knitting shop during the day , counting the breaks as her own special therapy . <p> Dana hit the start button on the coffeemaker . " I 'd like to write a book one of these days . One of those self-help , how-to 's with a snappy title ? Three Secrets to Happiness , Wealth , Love , and Great Sex ... All the Time ... Or Your Money Back . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I would definitely read it . Wait a second ... maybe I have read it ? " <p> " Yeah , so did I. " Dana smiled at her . <p> The coffee had dripped into the pot , the scent energizing . Dana poured out two mugs and handed one to Lucy . <p> They both turned at the sound of Suzanne Cavanaugh 's voice , greeting Maggie with a shriek . " What happened to this place ? Where 's our table ? " <p> Lucy emerged from the storeroom just in time to see their fellow knitter , Suzanne , spin in a confused circle , searching for their usual meeting place . <p> " We moved the table up front for the refreshments , " Maggie explained . Along with the quiche , Maggie would be serving muffins and cookies , coffee , and tea . She went the distance , Lucy had to hand it to her . <p> " Why do n't we just sit up here ? There 's room for everyone . " Dana led the way back to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more chairs and make a circle . " <p> Maggie checked the time . " I guess we 'd better start without Phoebe . " Maggie toted a chair over and unfolded it . " She 's probably stuck at school . That European history class . " <p> Maggie had barely finished the thought when the shop door swung open . <p> But it was not Phoebe . Not even close . <p> Lucy heard Maggie 's quiet , sharp breath as a short , dark-eyed woman stepped into view . She pushed back the hood of a voluminous Aryan knit wrap , its workmanship and detail impressive , even at a distance . <p> It was Amanda Goran . For a moment , Lucy did n't recognize her . She looked so different . Then she spoke and her voice  --  thin , nasal , totally irritating  --  dispelled any doubt . <p> " Hello , Maggie . I saw the lights on and the door was open .... Are you giving a class tonight ? " <p> " Not exactly ... " <p> " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wow , look at this place . You must expect a real crowd . " <p> Maggie forced a small smile . " It 's a hot ticket . " <p> Lucy could sense Maggie 's discomfort . Or maybe it was just curiosity about this unexpected honor . <p> Amanda rarely set foot in the Black Sheep and never wearing such a cheerful expression . Well , it was as close as Amanda ever got to cheerful . She probably had more enemies than friends in Plum Harbor , but she considered Maggie her number one archrival . For a long time Amanda 's shop , the Knitting Nest , had been the only choice for local knitters , until the Black Sheep hopped onto Main Street . <p> Amanda had resented the quick success of Maggie 's store , which had easily eclipsed her own . She 'd always taken it personally . Maggie usually laughed off the feud as all in Amanda 's head , though her contentious rival had managed to get under Maggie 's skin more than once in the past few years . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore her . <p> " Can I help you with something ? " Maggie started to rise from her chair . <p> " Do n't get up . " Amanda waved at her . " I just wanted to say hello . " Amanda took a few more steps inside and fingered a skein of yarn that sat in a basket on a side table . Then she read the label and nodded . " Organic . Nice .... Wow , look at that price . Are you trying to put me out of business , Maggie ? " <p> The accusation was delivered with a small surprised laugh . Maggie managed another tight smile . " A new supplier . She 's giving good discounts to build her business . Would you like her card ? " <p> " That 's okay . I 'm not getting involved with any new labels right now . I 'm trying to take a step back from the Nest . " <p> " Really ? " Maggie did n't bother to hide her surprise . Lucy was surprised , too . Amanda was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say . <p> " I 'm looking for a manager , " she added . " If you think of anyone , let me know . " <p> " Yes , I will , " Maggie promised . <p> Amanda plucked a ball of yarn from another basket and slipped on her reading glasses for a closer inspection . Maggie glanced at her friends . Everyone had pulled out their projects and had busily set to work , but of course , they still soaked up every word of the exchange . <p> Taking a step back from the knitting wars ? Lucy wondered . What had enticed Amanda to suddenly retreat from battle ? Whatever it was , it seemed to agree with her . <p> Amanda rewound the wool and carefully set the ball back in the basket . " You really have some nice stock in here Maggie . And so well displayed . " <p> Had Amanda actually given Maggie a compliment ? Lucy saw Maggie 's eyes widen . She was speechless . <p> Amanda slipped her wrap around her arms and turned to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow for a good seat . " <p> " Yes , you really should , " Maggie replied , finding her voice again . " Cara will start at eleven , but we 'll be open at nine . " <p> " I 'll come when you open , then . " She flashed a grin , displaying dazzling white teeth . " See you , ladies . " <p> The others looked up from their work and nodded good-bye as Amanda swished through the doorway . <p> Maggie raised her hand and waved . " Good night , Amanda . See you  --  " <p> The door snapped closed and they sat in absolute silence . <p> Lucy imagined Amanda lingering on the porch , about to pop back in for a sneak attack . She slowly looked around at her friends . " Did that really happen ? " Her gaze came to rest on Maggie . " Is she really coming here tomorrow ? " <p> " I 'd worry about that , if I were you . " Suzanne 's clicking needles echoed her concern . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What if she 's coming just to screw things up ? " <p> Suzanne was their official Fretting Queen . But this time , Lucy thought Suzanne had a point . <p> " I thought about that , too , when she called to sign up , " Maggie admitted . " But I had plenty of room left and I did n't feel right being rude to her . Maybe she wo n't even come . " Maggie touched her forehead with her hand . " I ca n't remember the last time she stopped in here like that . Or maybe I just blocked it out of my memory ? " <p> Dana finished a row and turned her work to the other side . She was making a long , belted cardigan with a shawl collar using taupe-colored wool with a touch of angora . Lucy thought it was going to look fabulous on her . <p> " I 'm sure any visit from Amanda is always fraught with drama , " Dana said . " Funny how she 'd seemed so conciliatory tonight . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I almost did n't recognize her , " Lucy admitted . " Even her teeth were sort of ... glowing . " <p> " Looked like veneers to me , " Suzanne agreed . " You ca n't get there with the home strips . " <p> " Her hair looked really good , too , " Lucy noted . " I wonder where she had it done . " <p> Amanda had changed her dowdy Dutch boy style for a ragged razor cut and a brighter color . Her plain features were enhanced by serious makeup , Lucy had noticed . Eyes , lips , foundation  --  the works . It did n't look like drugstore stuff , either . Definitely department store quality . <p> " A new and improved Amanda , " Maggie summed up . " Her personality included . I think she actually gave me a compliment . " <p> " Could you believe it ? What was that about ? " Suzanne shook her head . <p> Dana set her knitting down and checked the pattern . " I 've always thought she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she started taking some medication . There are some terrific new drugs out there now . " <p> Dana was rarely at a loss for a diagnosis , but in this case , Lucy thought it was a smart call . Amanda did seem transformed from the inside out . <p> " She lost some weight , too . But everybody loses weight when their marriage breaks up . " Suzanne sounded very knowledgeable for someone who had married her high school boyfriend and seemed to be living happily ever after , juggling her part-time job in real estate with the 24/7 job of running a home and raising three children . <p> Lucy had some personal experience with the divorce diet . She 'd dropped twenty pounds during her breakup with Eric , and , just like Amanda , had splurged for the requisite overpriced haircut . By now , she had gained about half the weight back and her long wavy hair had returned to its former dirty blonde color and unruly style . <p> " Amanda and Peter are not divorced yet . They 're not even legally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , but I do n't think they 've signed anything . Jack knows the attorney who 's representing Peter , and I hear Amanda is tough as nails negotiating . " <p> " Why am I not surprised ? " Maggie murmured . <p> Dana 's husband , Jack , had had a full career as a county detective before returning to school for a law degree and now practiced in town . Between the two of them , Dana and Jack were privy to the inside story on many residents of Plum Harbor . Not that she lacked in discretion or professional ethics in any way , Lucy thought , Dana did n't mind adding a few insider footnotes to stories that were common knowledge . <p> " She 'll never find a guy like Peter , willing to put up with all her quirks , that 's for sure . " Suzanne rolled her eyes . " Why did they split up in the first place ? " <p> Dana took a snip of black yarn and tied a marker at the end of her row . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day she just cleared all the furniture and the handcrafted things he makes and dumped it all in a pile on the sidewalk . Before Peter could get over there , half of it was gone . " <p> Lucy had not been in the Knitting Nest for ages , but she did recall Peter 's wares took up a good portion of the space . <p> " He 's a good craftsman . His pieces have simple lines but are very artistic , " Maggie said sympathetically . " Knowing Amanda , anything could have set her off . " <p> Dana pursed her lips , concentrating on her stitches . Lucy sensed she knew more about the Gorans ' marriage than she would say . Dana glanced up at her friends , then down at her needles . <p> " What did she do with all the empty space in the shop ? " Lucy asked . <p> " Moved in a huge spinning wheel ... and a big display of her dog sweaters . " Maggie 's gaze remained on her knitting but Lucy saw her laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to the Knitting Nest , but somehow she managed to keep up with any changes there , Lucy noticed . <p> " Kicking Peter out of the shop does make more room for the dogs . How convenient , " Suzanne said . She 'd been fishing through her big tapestry knitting bag for something and finally came up with a crumpled copy of her pattern . <p> Suzanne was a fast but impatient knitter and she hated to follow a pattern . Everybody teased her about it . Or maybe she was just multitasking so much , she did n't have time to check instructions . On any given night , poor Suzanne ended up frogging half her work , ripping out half as many rows as she 'd finished . She was making a chulo hat for her thirteen-year-old daughter , Alexis , but had never worked with three colors before . <p> " Andrea and Peter never had children . The dogs obviously take up the emotional slack . Transference , " Dana offered . <p> There seemed to be plenty of that . Amanda was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't quite sure how many she had now . A pack of mixed-breed hounds she 'd adopted from shelters and rescue groups . That was another reason customers avoided the Knitting Nest . Amanda always kept two or three of her canine crew in the shop with her and some people were uncomfortable around dogs , or simply did n't like dealing with all the cold , wet noses and the pet hair getting into their projects . <p> " Maggie ... can you fix this ... please ? This snowflake is turning into a spider . " Maggie stuck her hand out and Suzanne handed over her project . White , blue , and pink bobbins of yarn dangled from the piece . <p> Maggie examined Suzanne 's knitting , then picked up a few stitches to get her back on track . <p> " I , for one , am all in favor of a kinder and gentler Amanda Goran . I think it 's very hard for a person to change . I give her a lot of credit . Whatever the reason behind the transformation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed Suzanne back her knitting . <p> The front door of the shop swung open . They held their breath and looked up to see who was coming in this time . <p> Phoebe , finally . <p> She clomped in , big black boots scraping the wooden floor . Her cheeks were ruddy from the cold , her dark eyes bright . A fuzzy , multicolored scarf of her own creation looped around her neck , dangling down the front of her black peacoat . A streak of magenta in the scarf matched the one dyed in her dark hair . <p> She swung her book bag off her shoulder and smiled . <p> " Hi , guys . Sorry I 'm late ... did I miss anything ? " <br> <p> Lucy got home around ten . She felt tired but needed to make up lost time on her current work project  --  designing a set of pamphlets explaining employee health insurance benefits . She knew she 'd be out again most of the day tomorrow and did n't have that much breathing room on the deadline . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only been working on it a week . But it was paying the rent , Lucy kept reminding herself . <p> She kept at it until half past one , then decided to quit for the night . Before shutting down the computer , she quickly checked her eG ? ? mail . A message from her sister Ellen reminding Lucy she was expected at a dinner party at Ellen 's house in Concord this coming Saturday night . Lucy had forgotten all about it ... conveniently . The mere thought of sitting through one of Ellen and Scott 's get-togethers made her want to run to her bed and put a pillow over her head . <p> Ellen had been sympathetic enough during Lucy 's divorce , but now acted as if it had been an unfortunate but fairly common ailment , like whiplash or a compressed disc . Lucy could not expect to recover and return to a normal life if she did n't bare down and commit to " the therapy . " If Lucy was still not " moving on " with her life at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe she was just plain lazy . <p> Secretly , Lucy had to agree at least a little with this diagnosis , though she was n't sure what she could do about it . Especially when " the therapy " took the form of one of Ellen 's get-togethers , where Lucy knew she would be surrounded by happy  --  or presumably happy  --  suburban couples . With the exception of one unattached , presumably straight man that Ellen always invited as the latest candidate . <p> Ellen 's well-intentioned matchups were , without exception , disastrous . Lucy sometimes went through the motions just to avoid hurting Ellen 's feelings ... or avoid her nagging . This time , however , she typed a quick note , claiming she had a bad deadline and could not possibly come to Concord ... as much as she wanted to . <p> There was also a message from her mother , who was down in Nicaragua , building houses and latrines in a poverty-stricken village . Her mother 's idea of a great tropical vacation , bless her heart . Isabel Binger taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was on a sabbatical this year . <p> Lucy and Ellen had been raised near Amherst , in the town of Northampton . Their parents had divorced when Lucy was in college . Her father , Harry Binger , had retired from his law practice and immediately moved down to Myrtle Beach . He 'd always hated the cold winters in the northeast and its brief golfing season . Lucy had visited him once at his condo community . She found the place a lot like the Jersey shore but with palm trees and miles of real golf courses , instead of miniature ones  --  though there were a lot of those , too . <p> Her father had married a woman named Sheila who shared his values and priorities  --  well-maintained greens , dry martinis , and watching a lively panel of celebrity guests on Larry King Live . <p> While it was easy to say Ellen had taken after their father and Lucy was clearly her mother 's child , Lucy knew that it was never so simple as that . <p> There were a few other messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't believe that she was still living out here . At first , neither could Lucy . <p> During her summers growing up , Lucy 's parents more or less dumped her and Ellen with their aunt Laura , who was a schoolteacher with summers off , for weeks at a stretch , as if Laura 's home were some convenient free summer camp . But Aunt Laura looked forward to it , being unmarried and without kids of her own . Once the girls were in high school and college , summer jobs and their social lives reduced their visits to Plum Harbor down to a weekend or two . Then when she got busy with her career and marriage , Lucy had not come up very often at all . <p> Aunt Laura seemed to understand . She was not the whining or judgmental type . When Laura died last spring , the cottage that had always been her home was left to Lucy and Ellen . <p> Lucy had just left her office job and set up her own business so she decided to take a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear her head and regroup after so many life-altering changes in such a short time . <p> Ellen was happy to have Lucy stay in the house , instead of renting it out to strangers . Lucy 's older sister , who was married with two girls , came out for a weekend only once with her family . <p> Plum Harbor was n't really Ellen 's speed anymore . She was more of a Nantucket or Martha 's Vineyard type now . Lucy basically had the place to herself . Ellen had n't even wanted any of the furniture , with the exception of a small , tiger oak secretary and a mohogany ballroom chair . They were the only pieces of any value , of course . But Lucy knew she was still getting the better of the bargain . <p> Lucy 's own belongings , her half of the furniture she 'd shared with her exG ? ? husband , made a curious mix with Aunt Laura 's home decor  --  early American meets early IKEA . Lucy was still trying to sort it all out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Maggie had warned . It was especially so after the holidays , when it was like watching an ant hill , Lucy decided . At first there does n't seem to be any activity , but if you keep staring , you 'll eventually see a steady stream of coming and going , a flow of quiet , methodical industry . The empty beach and open spaces had a strange , subtle beauty this time of year , making their summer glory seem obvious and ordinary . <p> Looking back now , she was n't sure if she would have stayed if it had n't been for Maggie . She had wandered into the Black Sheep one day , purely by chance and did n't even know how to hold knitting needles . But one thing led to another and it was impossible now to trace back to the moment when she and the sisterhood of traveling knitting totes had become true friends , or the moment Lucy realized she was totally hooked on knitting  --  something she at times considered a mixed blessing . <br> <p> Early the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair wet and altogether skipping makeup . She 'd definitely duck any photographers from the Plum Harbor Times . She had promised Maggie she 'd come to the shop by nine to help with any last-minute details . <p> By the time she parked in front of the Black Sheep , the dashboard clock read 8:55 . Lucy was surprised to find the shop dark , still closed up tight , and Maggie 's car nowhere in sight . She walked up on the porch and peered into the bay window . Maggie was definitely not in there . Neither was Phoebe . <p> She waited a moment , thinking she might walk up the street and pick up some coffee . But before she could decide , Maggie 's dark green Subaru pulled up and Maggie jumped out , white plastic shopping bags dangling from each hand and a bouquet of flowers tucked under her arm . <p> " Oh , good , you 're here . Could you grab this stuff while I open the door ? " <p> Maggie handed over a bag , then unlocked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order at the bakery , I realized I was n't serving anything healthy . So I ran over to the supermarket for some fruit . Berries . Nice ones . You 'd never expect it this time of year . " <p> " Good idea . " Lucy nodded . Knowing Maggie , there would be more than enough food , with or without berries . But Maggie did want the event to be perfect . <p> While Maggie carried the shopping bags inside , Lucy went back to Maggie 's car , where she found several white cardboard boxes from the bakery in the trunk . She carried them inside and walked back to the storeroom . <p> Maggie was working near the sink , arranging flowers in a tall vase . She glanced at Lucy over her shoulder . " Could you take these outside , please ? I think the counter near the register would be a good spot . " <p> The vase was slippery and Lucy carried it carefully . She had just set it down in its assigned spot when the shop door swung open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She paused and looked around , then stepped inside . Her long , swishy shearling coat was the real thing , Lucy noticed , not a faux version from L.L. Bean . Under that , Lucy caught a glimpse of an attractive three-quarter-length sweater made of multicolored yarn . <p> The young woman had barely shut the door behind her when Maggie seemed to fly through the air , appearing out of nowhere . <p> " Cara ! So good to see you . " The women shared a quick hug and Maggie stepped back . Cara Newhouse smiled down at her former teacher . <p> " Good to see you , too , Maggie .... Wow . Look at this place . The flowers . Everything . You should n't have gone to so much trouble . " <p> Maggie shook her head , but looked pleased . " I wanted to do something special now that you 're so well known . " <p> Cara seemed embarrassed by the praise . " Do n't be silly . I 'm no celebrity . " <p> " You are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " Maggie turned to Lucy and waved her over . " I want you to meet my good friend , Lucy Binger . " <p> Lucy stretched out her hand as Maggie introduced them . " Nice to meet you , Cara . " <p> " Thanks . Nice to meet you , too . " Cara nodded and smiled . <p> " We put a table for the demonstration back there . " Maggie pointed to the far side of the shop 's main room . " We thought that would be the easiest place for everyone to see . But we did leave an aisle , so you can walk around as you talk , " Maggie explained . <p> " I can walk around . I can work at the table , I 'll do whatever you 'd like , " Cara said agreeably . <p> " How about the TV people ? Where do you think they 'll put the camera ? " <p> " Oh , they 're not coming . They called this morning and canceled . " <p> Cara shrugged as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . I 'm really not ready . This will be good practice . I 'm going to audition at the studio next week . " <p> Maggie looked disappointed for a moment , then quickly recovered . " Just as well . A camera crew in here today would have made it even crazier . " <p> Phoebe had come down from her apartment , Lucy noticed . She poked her head out of the storeroom and waved at Maggie . " I need another basket for the muffins . Are there any more back here ? " <p> " Looks like I 'm needed , " Maggie said . " I 'll be right back ... " <p> Cara started toward the table and Lucy offered to help with the large tote bags she was carrying . Cara handed one over . It was filled with all kinds of things : knitting tools , yarn , measuring sticks . <p> " I feel like Mary Poppins when I start pulling all this stuff out of my bags . " <p> Cute , Lucy thought , though she 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the original Nanny 911 . Cara looked every inch the knitting world diva and soon-to-be TV host . She was a perfect TTB  --  Lucy 's exG ? ? husband 's acronym for tall thin blonde . She had the type of figure that looked good in long , draping sweaters and shawls , and ... okay , a body that would look great draped in almost anything . Or nothing . <p> Lucy studied Cara 's three-quarter-length sweater coat , knitted in a tweedy , medium-weight wool . The coat was embellished with fringe on the cuffs and hem , and wonderful felted flowers that covered snap fasteners . Her black top , black pants , and boots set off the piece perfectly . <p> " Nice jacket , " Lucy complimented her . <p> " Thanks , the design is in my book . I 'm going to talk about it and show everyone how to make the flowers , " she promised with another toothpaste-ad smile . " I can make the stuff just fine , but I can get a little confused if I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted with a laugh . " So please ask a lot of questions . " <p> " Okay , I 'll remember that , " Lucy promised . <p> Cara was different than Lucy had expected . More down to earth . Modest even . Not nearly the prima donna she could be . Maybe it was just Maggie 's description of Cara 's success that had given that impression.A <p> s for Cara 's concerns about her show-and-tell skills , Lucy did n't think Cara needed to sweat it . Just look at her . What producer would care if she did n't know a knitting needle from a chopstick ? <p> Just as Cara finished setting up , the audience began to arrive . Phoebe handed out programs . Lucy noticed Dana come in . She waved , but was too far away to make her way over . Suzanne was late , as usual . Lucy hoped she could save a good seat . <p> Where was Amanda Goran ? Amanda had definitely not been one of the early birds , as she 'd promised last night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in under the radar somehow ? Lucy looked around but did n't see Maggie 's notorious rival in the rows of guests already seated . <p> Amanda 's absence suddenly made Lucy worry . She wondered if Maggie had noticed , too . Was Amanda planning to make some scene that would undermine the event ? Or had she just chickened out ? No matter what she 'd said last night , from Amanda 's point of view , coming here this morning was a sign of submission . Even defeat . For everyone 's sake , Lucy hoped Amanda had decided to just stay in her own territory . <p> The audience was mostly women , with a few men sprinkled in here and there . About fifty guests , Lucy estimated , probably the largest turnout for a Black Sheep event to date . While Plum Harbor was a small village , little more than two square miles around , the Black Sheep did draw customers from all the neighboring towns and Cara was well known in the community . <p> The reporter from the Plum Harbor Times had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo in front of the flower arrangement . Cara held up a copy of her book and they both smiled for the camera . <p> Everything was going perfectly . At precisely eleven , Maggie stepped in front of the group and gently raised her hands for quiet , revealing her past life as a schoolteacher , Lucy thought . The chattering voices stopped . <p> " Thank you all for coming to the Black Sheep this morning , " she began . " We try to present speakers and classes that will enrich and inspire your love of knitting . Today , we have a very special guest , Cara Newhouse . Cara will be talking about her new book , Felting Fever , and giving some great tips on the process . " <p> The audience answered with a smattering of applause . <p> Maggie continued . " A lot of you have told me you 'd love to try this technique , but feel intimidated . Time to let go of your fear of felting , ladies . " She smiled widely as she urged Cara forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knitting Now ! and two other bestselling books . Plum Harbor 's own Cara Newhouse ... " <p> Lucy watched Cara stroll front and center . She turned to the audience , her smile growing even wider as the welcoming applause rose . <p> Cara was just about to speak when the front door flew open . <p> Suzanne stumbled into the shop . She stared at Phoebe , looking pale and wild eyed , her lipstick smeared . Lucy 's heart kicked into overdrive . What in the world happened ? Was something wrong with one of Suzanne 's kids ? <p> The entire audience grew quiet as all eyes turned toward the doorway . <p> Suzanne 's chin trembled . She glanced around the room . " Did n't you hear what happened to Amanda Goran ? She 's dead ! " Copyright 2009 by Anne Canadeo <br> Continues ...
