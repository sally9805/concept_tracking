Chapter One The Block Estate Dining Room 7:45 PM October 23rd Massie Block hated herself for looking so beautiful . She angled a silver soup spoon toward her face and quickly glanced at her reflection . The new caramel-colored highlights in her dark hair brought out the amber flecks in her eyes and made them sparkle , just like her stylist , Jakkob , had promised . She was debuting a brown suede miniskirt that made her butt look even perkier than usual , and her arms and legs were lightly dusted with gold shimmer powder . Massie dropped the spoon and pushed it aside . She could n't believe she was wasting this red-carpet outfit on her father 's birthday dinner , especially since they were spending it at home with the Lyonses . " Happy biiirthday , dear William , happy birthday to youuuuuu . " The two families finished their song with a round of light applause . William 's face turned purple as he struggled to blow out all forty candles at once , and Massie could n't help giggling . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated around an elegant oak table in the Blocks ' dining room , unable to fully see one another because of the elaborate centerpieces that overflowed with seasonal fruitsand flowers . The teardrop-shaped bulbs on the crystal chandelier had been dimmed . The soft warm glow from the red candles was the room 's main source of light . Massie had been forced to sit between the two Lyons kids thanks to her mother 's need to micromanage . On her left , Claire was shoveling a massive piece of sugary cake into her mouth as if Cosmo suddenly declared " fat " was the new " thin . " Massie turned away . To her right was Todd , Claire 's ten-year-old brother . Massie watched in disgust as he reached his icing-covered fingers over her plate to grab the pitcher of grape juice . " Eew , " Massie said under her breath . She folded her thin arms tightly across her chest and shot her mother a sarcastic thanks-a-lot look . Kendra smiled back innocently . Massie rolled her eyes . But before her pupils could finish their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice that soaked the front of her skirt . " Ehmagod ! " Massie yelled . She pushed away from the table and jumped from her chair . " Sorry . " Todd shrugged his shoulders . " It was an accident . " He was fighting a smile and Massie knew he was lying . " I swear , it 's like you were raised by a pack of unbelievably dumb wolves , " she said , dabbing her skirt with a white cloth napkin . " Massie , " Kendra snapped . She looked at Judi Lyons and shook her head apologetically . Massie blushed . She realized her comment was more insulting to Todd 's parents than to Todd but was too upset to apologize . If anyone should be saying " sorry , " it was them . Ever since Labor Day , when the Lyons family left Orlando and moved into the Blocks ' guesthouse , Massie 's life had pretty much sucked . For the last two months Claire had been forcing herself on Massie . She crashed Massie 's carpool , followed her around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best friends . Lately Todd had been fighting for her attention too . The entire family was cramping her style and Massie was desperate to shake them . She hated that her dad chose to be " old college buddies " with Jay Lyons . Why could n't he have picked Calvin Klein ? Todd grabbed a napkin and started rubbing Massie 's skirt as if he was buffing the hood of a sports car . " Lemme help you . " " Uchhh . Stay away from me , perv . " Massie slapped his arm . Massie saw her mother slide the diamond pendant back and forth on the platinum chain around her neck and shoot her husband a stern do-something look from across the table . " Sweetie , relax , " William said to his daughter . " Todd is only trying to help . " His voice was firm and fatherly . " I 'll buy you another skirt . " " But he did it on purpose , " Massie said . " I saw him tilt the pitcher on me . " Kendra lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it until Inez , the Blocks ' live-in housekeeper , burst through the swinging door . " Yes , Mrs. Block ? " Inez smoothed the apron on her uniform , then cupped her hand around the tight gray bun on the back of her head . She liked everything in its proper place . Kendra sighed and directed her gaze toward Massie . Inez took one look at the stain and darted back into the kitchen . She returned with a bottle of seltzer water and a sponge . Massie lifted her arms out to her sides and Inez started scrubbing as hard and fast as her bony arms would allow . " Todd , did you do that on purpose ? " Judi Lyons asked her son . She popped a chocolate-covered strawberry into her tiny mouth and did her best to chew it with her mouth closed . " Of course he did , " Massie screeched . " He 's been staring at me with his big wet cow eyes ever since we sat down . " " Son , it looks like you 're about as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his big belly and let out a hearty chuckle . Todd kissed his fingertips and winked . Everyone laughed except Massie . " Congratulations , Todd . You finally got me to notice you , " Massie hissed . " What are you going to do tomorrow when I forget about you again ? Blowtorch my bedroom ? " Claire took the napkin off her lap and threw it on her plate . " Well , at least it 's just an outfit , right ? " Claire said . " It 's not like you were hurt or anything . " " It 's not ' just an outfit , ' Kuh-laiiire . " Massie pinched her skirt . " This is suede . " " Oh , " Claire said . Then she chuckled to herself . " What ? " Massie snapped . " I was just thinking how funny it is that , you know , clothes are sooo important to you . That 's all . " " Actually , Claire , I find it ' funny ' just how UN-important clothes are to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And for some reason , you think those thick cords are for girls , when they 're clearly for gangly dorks . " Massie pointed to Todd . " You know , like your brother . " Massie moved away from Inez when she noticed how hard the woman was scrubbing . Chunks of yellow sponge had come off on her skirt . Massie was heartbroken . It was the most flattering skirt she had , and now it was destined to become a pillow for her black pug , Bean . She looked directly at Claire as if all of this was her fault . " Hint , Claire . Next time you order your entire wardrobe from the J. Crew catalog , flip past the men 's section , " Massie said . " The women 's clothes are always in the back . " " How would you know ? " Claire said to her cords . " I thought you were waaay too fashionable to shop from a cat-a-log . " She said " catalog " the same way she 'd say " snot sandwich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to the mall and buy you a new skirt ? It 'll be fun ! " Judi Lyons clapped her pudgy hands and smiled as if she had just announced they were going to start celebrating Christmas five times a year . Massie chugged her Pellegrino so she would n't have to respond to the offer . She could n't imagine anything worse than having to wear something Judi Lyons picked out . The entire family dressed like tourists-oversized T-shirts , light wash denim , and sensible shoes . " At least my entire life does n't revolve around what people think of my outfits . " Claire reached for the bobby pin that kept her overgrown bangs out of her eyes and slid it out of her blond hair . She gathered the pieces of hair that hung around her face and repinned them on the sides of her head . " Hey , I thought we were supposed to be celebrating , " Jay Lyons said . " Last time I checked , this was a birthday party . " He pinched a piece of yellow cake off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Massie watched with satisfaction as her fit and trim puppy turned her tiny black nose up at the offer . She patted her thigh and Bean ran to her . " Daddy , I did n't mean to ruin your party , " Massie said to William . " It 's just that I take pride in the way I look . " She reached down and straightened the drooping turquoise feather boa around Bean 's neck . " You taught me that , remember ? " " Of course I remember , honey , " William said . " And you always look perfect to me . " " No thanks to him , " Massie said , glaring at Todd . Todd put his head in his hands and slowly rocked back and forth as if he was full of misery and regret . Massie knew he was faking , but Claire obviously had no clue . " Massie , there is a difference between pride and obsession , " Claire said . She put her arm around Todd 's shoulders and continued . " Once you start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsession . " Claire 's hand trembled as she reached for her glass of soda . The room was silent . " Claire has a point , sweetie , " Kendra said . She ran her fingers through her silky brown bob . " You have n't walked through the front door without a shopping bag since you were nine . " " That 's not true . " Massie put her hands on her hips and stood tall . " It is , " Claire said . " In the two months I 've been here , you 've gone shopping in New York City four times . And what about all of the after-school trips to the Westchester Mall ? " " Clothes are a necessity , " Massie said . " I ca n't walk around naked , can I ? " " Says who ? " Todd said with a devilish grin . " I think you can . " " Todd ! " Judi snapped . " He 's just playing , dear , " Jay said . " Are n't you , son ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , who chuckled and shook his head . Massie looked at Todd and rolled her eyes . " You 're a shopoholic , " Claire said . " I bet you ca n't go an entire month without buying new clothes . " " Oh yeah ? Well , you 're a repeat offender . I bet you could n't go an entire month without wearing the same outfit twice , " Massie said . " Keds included . " " Massie ! " Kendra and William exclaimed at the same time . " Okay . " Claire rose from her seat and stood to face Massie . " The first one to fold has to wear the other person 's clothes to school for a week . " Massie 's eyes widened with horror at the thought of having to wear high-waisted Gap jeans and sneakers to school . " No way , " Massie said . " You 'd be lucky to wear my clothes . That 's not a punishment-it 's a reward . It 's got to be something bad . " Massie twirled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , the loser has to wear one of my old snowsuits to class for a week . That includes leggings , goggles , ski boots , gloves , and a hat . " " Massie , you 're being ridiculous , " Kendra said . Massie kept her focus on Claire . " Fine , " Claire agreed . She extended her arm and Massie grabbed Claire 's hand . They shook over and over again , because neither one wanted to be the first to bow out and let go . " This is great , Claire , thank you , " William said with a playful smile . " You just saved me a ton of money . " The parents chuckled . But Claire and Massie 's expressions did n't change . Their mouths were tightly pursed and both had a look of determination in their eyes . Massie finally tore her hand away to answer her ringing cell phone . She lifted it out of the Louis Vuitton monogrammed case that was clipped to the belt on her skirt and walked out of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was pacing around the cream-colored rug in the living room . " Hey , it 's Alicia . I have news that 's worth at least ten gossip points . " Massie felt her heart speed up like it always did when she was about to hear gossip . She knew Alicia Rivera was n't the type to ask for ten points unless she really deserved them . The Spanish beauty was a gossip expert and knew better than anyone that a decent piece usually earned about five points , max . This had to be big . " Talk to me , " Massie said . She sat down in the white wing chair beside the fireplace . " I was in my golf class after school , right ? " " Right . " Massie slipped out of the chair and started pacing again . " And while we were stretching ... " " Yeah ? Yeah ? What ? " Now she was bouncing on her toes . " I heard Becca Wilder tell Liz Goldman that she thinks you are on your way out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror over the mantel . " What do you mean , out ? " " Becca thinks that you 're slipping and that you do n't seem as in charge as you did last year . " " What did Liz say ? " " Liz agreed , " Alicia said . " But that 's nothing new . Liz always agrees with Becca . Anyway , they came up with the idea to throw an amazing boy-girl Halloween party so everyone would be talking about them and not you for a change . They even called it a Halloweenie party . " Massie was stunned . Her body felt frozen solid and burning hot at the same time . Her head was spinning . Am I slipping ? Are people starting to look at me as a popularity has-been ? Why did n't I pick up on this sooner ? Are Becca and Liz the only ones who think that , or is the whole grade over me ? Why did n't I think of the boy-girl party ? It should have been my idea . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening , " Massie heard herself say . She had meant to think it , but like everything these days , it had n't worked out the way she had planned . " If you want , I can have my dad 's bodyguard scare the idea out of her , " Alicia said with a soft giggle . " No thanks , I 'll do it myself , " Massie said . " I 'll show Becca and Liz and the rest of the grade that I 'm not slipping . I got ta go . " She was about to hang up when she realized Alicia was still on the line . " Wait , " Alicia asked . " What about the ten points ? " " This is n't about points , Alicia , " Massie said . " It 's about pride . " And she snapped her phone shut . Massie was about to walk back into the dining room but stopped when she heard her name . She crouched down behind the French doors so no one would see her and held her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I honestly do n't know what it is with Massie and Claire , " Judi said . " I thought they would be the best of friends by now . " Massie peered around the door to see Claire 's reaction . But her seat was empty . She must have slipped out while Massie was on the phone . " I agree with Judi , " Kendra added . " I am so surprised . " " You do n't look it , " William said . Kendra shrugged . " Botox . " " Just because they live on the same property does n't mean they have to be joined at the hip , " Jay said . " Maybe they need a little more time to adjust to each other . You know , like a couple of territorial house cats . " " Hissing cats would be a welcome change around here , " Kendra said . She moved a half-eaten strawberry around her plate with a small silver dessert fork . " I 've tried everything to bring them together . I am fresh out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , moving the deep red herringbone place mat with it so the plate would n't scratch the glossy oak table . Massie stood up quietly , holding the dangling charms on her bracelet so they would n't clang . She scooped up Bean and tiptoed up the stairs to her bedroom . She had a deliciously devious idea . But before she did anything , Massie plopped down on her purple down-filled duvet and turned on her PalmPilot . Like other great historical figures , she had to sum up the latest events so future generations would have a record of her life . ( Continues ... )
