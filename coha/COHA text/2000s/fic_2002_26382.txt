Chapter One A Brief Conversation The Duchess of Girtons Bedchamber Lady Troubridge 's House Party East Cliff " Well , what does he look like ? " There was a pause . " He has black hair , I remember that , " Gina said dubiously . She was sitting at her dressing table and tying a hair ribbon into small knots . Ambrogina , Duchess of Girton , rarely fidgeted . Duchess is as duchess does , one of her governesses had insisted . But Gina was panicking . Even duchesses panic , on occasion . Esme Rawlings burst into laughter . " You do n't know what your own husband looks like ? " Gina scowled . " It 's easy for you to laugh . Your husband is n't returning from the continent to find you in the midst of a scandal . I 've been insisting that Cam annul our marriage so that I can marry Sebastian . After he reads that dreadful bit of gossip in The Tatler , he 'll think I 'm a loose woman . " " Not if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just it ! He does n't know me . What if he believes the talk about Mr. Wapping ? " " Fire your tutor and it 'll blow over in a week . " " I wo n't fire poor Mr. Wapping . He came all the way from Greece to be my tutor , and the poor man does n't have anywhere to go . Besides , he has n't done anything wrong , and neither have I , so why should I act as if I had ? " " Being seen with your tutor at two in the morning by Willoughby Broke and his wife was not the soundest policy . " " You know we were simply observing the meteor shower . At any rate , you 're not answering me . What if I do n't recognize my own husband ? " Gina turned around on her stool and fixed her eyes on Esme . " It will be the mosthumiliating moment of my life ! " " For goodness ' sake , you sound like a bad actress in a melodrama . He 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have time to collect yourself . Oh my dearest husband , " Esme said , casting Gina a melting look of welcome . " What a terrible , terrible sorrow your absence has been to me ! " She began fanning herself languidly . Gina grimaced at her . " I suppose you employ that sentence frequently ? " " Naturally . Miles and I are always polite , whenever we meet . Which is rare , thank goodness . " Gina put down the ribbon , now knotted in fifty places . " Look at this  --  my hands are shaking . I do n't know anyone who has experienced such a horrendous meeting . " " You 're exaggerating . Think how poor Caroline Pratt felt when she had to tell her husband she was pregnant  --  and he away in the Low Countries all the previous year ! " " That must have been difficult . " " Although she really did him a favor . What in God 's name would have happened to the estate if she had n't managed to produce an heir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Pratt should have thanked her very nicely , although I have no doubt but what he did n't , men being the boors they are . " " My point is that meeting Cam is going to be prodigiously difficult , " Gina said . " I 'm not sure I will know him from Adam . " " I thought you spent your childhood in his pocket . " " That 's not the same as meeting him as a grown man . He was just a boy when we married . " " There are plenty of women who would love to see their husbands move to the continent , " Esme pointed out . " Cam is not really my husband . For goodness ' sake , I was raised to think he was my first cousin , until the very day we married . " " I do n't see how that changes things . There are plenty of married first cousins , more 's the pity . And you are not truly first cousins , given that your mother merely raised you , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my husband is not truly my husband , " Gina added promptly . " Cam jumped out the window within fifteen minutes of his father forcing him to say the vows . It has simply taken him twelve years to return and annul the marriage . " " At least my husband left through the front door like a civilized man . " " Cam was hardly a man . He turned eighteen only a few days earlier . " " Well , you look glorious in that rose gown , " Esme said , smiling at Gina . " He 'll weep to think that he ever leaped out your bedchamber window . " " Nonsense . I 'm not beautiful . I 'm too thin and my hair resembles nothing so much as a carrot . " She peered at herself in the mirror . " I wish I had your eyes , Esme . Mine are the color of mud . " " Your eyes are not muddy , they 're green , " Esme corrected her . " And as for not being beautiful  --  look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all slender and composed and a bit teary . Except for your hair , of course . Do you think you inherited all that red hair from your scandalous French maman ? " " How should I know ? My father refused to describe my real mother . " " Actually , a Madonna is a perfect description , " Esme continued with a wicked twinkle . " Poor dear ... yet another married virgin ! " There was a knock at the door , and Annie , the duchess 's maid , answered it . " Lady Perwinkle would like to visit for a moment , Your Grace . " " Do ask her to come in , " Gina replied . Carola Perwinkle was small and deliciously rounded , with curls that bounced around her heart-shaped little face . She let out a squeal of delight at the sight of Esme . " Darlings ! I had to come even though it 's past time to dress because Lady Troubridge told me the most astounding tale about Gina 's husband  --  " " It 's true , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . " Carola clasped her hands together . " How romantic ! " " How so ? I see nothing romantic about my husband annulling our marriage . " " All the way from Greece , simply to free you , to allow you to marry the man you love ? I 've no doubt but that his heart is secretly broken at the thought . "
