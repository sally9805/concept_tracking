Rap Superstar Kanye West <P> Our profile of Kanye West brought kudos for his sampling of soulful artists as he spins the hip-hop nation away from gangsta rap . His statement , however , at a Hurricane Katrina fund raiser about President Bush and race  --  two weeks after he appeared on the cover  --  got a decidedly more mixed response <P> Your cover story on hip-hop musician Kanye West Aug. 29 was a brave and smart choice . You gave insights into who he is and , more important , why we should care . West does everything a true musical artist should do : write , produce and perform . He not only employs the traditional hip-hop technique of sampling but also uses samples of influential artists like Nina Simone , Shirley Bassey , Marvin Gaye and Luther Vandross . West 's songs pay homage to the origins of hip-hop and give today 's generation a chance to hear legendary musicians . <P> JUSTIN LI <P> Ottawa <P> In the same week , I received two great things in my mailbox : season tickets to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I do n't profess to be an expert on opera and hip-hop is far from my typical genre , I do know what I like  --  music that awakens a deeply emotional chord in my being . West 's The College Dropout rotates in my CD player between operas by Puccini and Bizet . His lyrics and music are soul baring and thought provoking , and they speak to the human spirit the way great opera does . <P> ROBERTA A.

LAMBORN <P> Redding , Calif . <P> I always hear snobby people dismiss hip-hop as trash . Although I am offended by what they say , I am forced to admit that sometimes it is true . Since the death of Tupac Shakur nine years ago , the hip-hop industry has just been spitting out meaningless raps over catchy beats . Thank you , Kanye , for putting life back into hip-hop . And thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's music .

He shows the class , intellect and business ethic of African Americans . As a white teacher in an urban setting , I am pleased to see a role model for many of my students who aspire to become rappers . You do n't need to be a drug-dealing thug to rap ! <P> KATRINA MAURER <P> Holyoke , Mass . <P> While I appreciated your story on the musical talents of West , did you really need to go so far as to call him a " class act " ? You noted that West dropped out of college and made something of himself . Kids are going to read that and think they can do it too . But that is n't classy , just lucky . And what about West 's lyrics ? He claims he tried not to use nigga , but he does  --  frequently . Perhaps West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convictions .
