Headnote THOUGH WINDOWS VISTA MAY BE SAFER THAN XP , MICROSOFT 'S FAR-FROM-IMPREGNABLE NEW OPERATING SYSTEM IS ALREADY PROVING TO BE VULNERABLE . BY RYAN NARAINE IN LATE MARCH , when security researchers stumbled upon drive-by download attacks exploiting yet another serious Windows hole , they had an eyeopening surprise : The vulnerability-caused by the way Windows handled animated cursor ( . ani ) files-did n't affect just Windows XP . It also hit Vista , Microsoft 's new security-centric OS . Security experts still proclaim Vista a major improvement over previous Windows versions , and readily say that its important new safety features-including an improved firewall , a " Protected Mode " for Internet Explorer , and User Account Control-make it much more resistant to the most common forms of spyware and malware . But this latest flaw ( now fixed ) is a major black eye for Microsoft ; along with two other critical security patches issued for Vista in its first three months on shelves , the problem has tarnished Vista 's security sheen ( see " Vista 's Vulnerabilities " on page 21 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its users must still be on their guard . NAGGING DEFENSE USER ACCOUNT control ( UAC ) has the best of intentions behind it . According to Microsoft 's own estimates , a whopping 95 percent of all pre-Vista Windows users perform everyday tasks logged in with Administrator credentials that let them make any kind of system changes-but that also allow malicious hackers to hijack a PC easily . By default , UAC requires a password for such tasks , keeping users-or malware-from haphazardly changing sensitive parts of the OS . But UAC is its own worst enemy . Its frequent pop-up prompts seriously annoy many users , particularly during setup of a new machine . The prompts appear less often after about ten days of heavy use , but some early adopters have never made it that far . " These alerts just kept popping up constantly and unnecessarily , " says Sergio E. Yanez , a Vista user who works as a vice president at a New York bank . " I would try to move a file between folders and have to deal with these prompts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yez responded by turning off UAC completely . In his case , he had to turn it back on to run some older games that required additional user rights , but the fear within security circles is that many irritated users will disable UAC and leave it off , or else get into the habit of clicking " Allow " at every prompt , defeating the purpose entirely . " The average user will be programmed to click " Allow " for everything , " says Roger Thompson , chief technical officer for security vendor Exploit Prevention Labs . Also , security researcher Joanna Rutkowska says that UAC has a design weakness in that it requires giving all program installations full system access whether they need it or not . ( Rutkowska 's report is at find.pcworld. com/57069 . ) Microsoft says that it included the potential weakness to ensure a smooth user experience , and it has not announced any plans to change UACs design . A second major addition to Vista 's security arsenal is Windows Defender , an antispyware tool that is available at no cost for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meant to be a full antivirus utility , it can easily scan for spyware applications that suck up system resources and bombard you with popup advertising . Defender also offers additional protection when you download files via Internet Explorer 7 . A great idea . But in independent tests performed by the AV-Test security lab ( AVTest.org ) , Defender detected only 65 percent of 14,517 adware and spyware samples in an on-demand scan . By comparison , detection rates for eight antivirus programs with built-in antispyware ran between 73 and 99 percent for the same test sample . " Windows Defender is not very good in my eyes . Most , if not all , stand-alone and integrated antispyware solutions are performing a lot better , " says Andreas Marx , CEO of AV-Test in Germany . A BETTER FIREWALL VISTA 'S IMPROVED firewall is another story . It offers the ability to block both inbound and outbound connections ( XP 's firewall blocks only incoming traffic ) . Outbound filtering provides a second layer of defense in blocking sophisticated forms of malware that make invisible connections from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary protection , deciding which apps should and should n't be blocked takes some technical know-how . For that reason , Microsoft turned it off by default . But even without outbound Filtering , the firewall " is better than good enough , " says Ed Bott , coauthor of Windows Visio inside Out . " It blocks all unsolicited incoming connections and is almost invisible in operation , " he says . And advanced users can configure outbound filtering for additional protection , while nontechnical users-who would be just as likely to break something as to prevent an attack , Bort says-are not forced to set up any rules for outbound filtering . The Vista Firewall passed most tests in AV-Test 's analysis . However , it was not able to filter incoming mail attachments , as some firewalls do . Also , it failed a large percentage of so-called leaktests , which use a specially crafted program to see whether a firewall will block outbound connection attempts . Still , many security companies and researchers , including AV-Test 's Marx , argue that since these programs are artificial ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , they may not provide accurate assessments of a firewall 's abilities . The Vista firewall , along with many others , may do a good job at blocking outside attempts to infiltrate your computer . But Internet programs must go through the firewall to browse a Web page , access your e-mail , or carry on an IM chat-and this itself creates an avenue for attack . Because Internet Explorer opens up the door to your PC and has such a huge user base , the browser is constantly under attack . To improve IE 7 's defenses , the Windows Vista version of the browser by default runs in Protected Mode , preventing IE-or any successful Internet attack that hijacks it-from changing sensitive parts of the operating system . This defense tactic has already been successful against current attacks that target holes such as the animated cursor flaw . Besides these up-front defenses , Vista also includes a number of back-end protections . PatchGuard attempts to block rootkits , which can hide virus infections . A technique called Address Space Layout Randomization makes it harder for malware to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kernel , the heart of any operating system , increase its resistance to hacker attacks . HUMAN ( IN ) SECURITY BUT WHILE VISTA is safer than XP , experts expect online thugs to quickly look for ways to circumvent Vista 's protections . One increasingly common method is to use socialengineering tactics to target the person , not the PC . " People will still execute that file to see Paris Hilton 's next video , " says Thompson of Exploit Prevention Labs . Social-engineering techniques that send malware in the guise of a game or a sexy video exploit people 's curiosity or ignorance to get them to click a tainted link or attachment . If someone clicks , the malware has already evaded half of their computer 's automated defenses , including the firewall . " Vista is an improvement , " says Thompson , " but it 's not the end of the malware industry . Not by a long shot . " Another potential end run around Vista 's defenses is to attack programs rather than the operating system . Media players such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent attacks as hackers discover and exploit serious software vulnerabilities-with poisoned online movie files , for example . To keep your machine safe , patching your programs has become just as important as fixing the operating system they run on . " The applications are sitting on every desktop , and they all have known vulnerabilities , " says Andrew ( aquith , a security analyst in The Yankee Group 's Enabling Technologies Enterprise division , For PC users , the message is clear : Though Vista may make things more difficult for crooks , it is far from impregnable . You will still need to apply patches to close the inevitable holes . And you must still use the same type of antivirus protection that you needed with XP .
