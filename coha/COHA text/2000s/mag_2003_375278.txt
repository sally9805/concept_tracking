The airplane turns 100 years old this year , with the anniversary of the Wright brothers ' flight at Kitty Hawk , N.C. , in 1903 . Almost as old is the deadly plane crash : the first airplane fatality took place in 1908 , claiming the life of an Army lieutenant named Thomas Selfridge . Somewhere between flying and crashing , and combining the thrills of both , lies the terrifyingly dangerous sport of competitive aerobatics . <P> Joshua Ramo was a hobbyist pilot who found himself mysteriously drawn to aerobatics , which he compares to aerial figure skating , with the following caveat : " When was the last time Kristy Yamaguchi burst into flames in the middle of a Salchow ? " In No Visible Horizon ( Simon &; Schuster ; 273 pages ) , Ramo , a former TIME editor , tells the story of his love affair with a sport that in a bad year , by his estimate , can kill 1 in 30 of its practitioners . Ramo buys a plane and learns to spin , loop , roll and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes pilgrimages to obscure Midwestern airfields for aerobatics competitions , and he seeks out those few masters of the sport who have survived long enough to pass on their wisdom . One of their truisms : " You will almost kill yourself once every hundred hours of flying . " <P> As he trains , Ramo also tries to figure out what drives him to pursue such an arcane , expensive and deadly pastime . " What is extreme flying for me but a kind of dialogue ? " he asks himself . " A conversation with myself about what I am capable of . " Ramo 's reverence for his fellow stunt pilots borders on the religious  --  he compares them variously with Yukio Mishima , John Coltrane and Pablo Picasso  --  and his lyrical flights sometimes lose the reader in the clouds . But when he 's in the cockpit performing feats of gritty derring-do ( and occasionally derring-do n't ) , his airplane groaning and shuddering around him with the strain , the book soars . " Flight is a miracle that has been domesticated into triviality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp edges ... in those places where flying still draws blood , the chance for miracles remains .
