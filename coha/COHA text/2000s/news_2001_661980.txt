In a Brooklyn park , Jewish kids in yarmulkes and black kids in braids watch a puppet show and squeeze onto rides , screaming with delight as their parents picnic nearby . <p> Police Sgt. Dave Wadler , who helps organize the annual gathering , looks around and smiles . " Ten years ago , they would n't have been in the same space , " he says . <p> This , after all , is Crown Heights . <p> Ten years ago , riots turned this Brooklyn neighborhood into a national symbol of ethnic strife . The trouble began Aug. 19 , 1991 , when a black 7-year-old , Gavin Cato , was struck and killed by a Jewish driver from the ultra-Orthodox Lubavitch community that is headquartered in Crown Heights . <p> Three hours later , a gang of blacks shouting , " Get the Jew ! " fatally stabbed a rabbinical student , Yankel Rosenbaum . <p> Violence surrounding the deaths - 188 injured , angry crowds breaking windows , shouting " Heil Hitler ! " and burning the Israeli flag - reverberated from City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . <p> Blacks still blame the unrest on pent-up anger over perceptions that Lubavitchers got preferential treatment from city officials . Jews say it was anti-Semitism , pure and simple . <p> Despite these unshakable views , something extraordinary has happened in the past 10 years : Blacks and Jews are healing Crown Heights . <p> Their kids have played sports together . Women from both sides formed a mothers group . Jews march in the West Indian Day Parade ; blacks attend Passover seders . <p> Rabbis lobbied for funding for Medgar Evers College , a predominantly black school . And the college gave members of the Lubavitch community access to its computers and swimming pool . <p> " There 's been a tremendous change , " says Rabbi Shea Hecht , who took a lobbying trip to Washington , D.C. , with Medgar Evers ' black president , Edison Jackson . <p> " A bond has developed , " Jackson says , " that was not in place before . " <p> Jean Griffith Sandiford is n't sure why she went to the site of Gavin 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers telling someone , " I think I can help . " <p> Sandiford , an immigrant from Trinidad , met a Lubavitch woman that day who had lived through the riots , Henna White . Together they created a group for black and Jewish women called Mothers to Mothers . <p> At first , their meetings were contentious . " One Jewish lady came and said she had been robbed , " Sandiford says . " I told her , ' All black persons are not the same thing . ' And all whites are not the same . " <p> Sandiford 's own son , Michael Griffith , was murdered by a gang of whites in 1986 in another New York neighborhood , Howard Beach in Queens . " I would never tell my children all white people are bad because they killed Michael , " she says . <p> Black women at the meetings complained that Lubavitch men would not make eye contact or shake their hands . <p> " Often they 're praying as they walk down the street ; it 's not that they wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining Lubavitch rules . " And it 's not that they wo n't touch your hand ; they wo n't touch any woman 's hand . " <p> These days the women chat about careers and families . " We got past the riots a long time ago , " says Lynn Posner , a Lubavitch woman . " Now we 're just friends . " <p> Carmel Cato , a Guyanese immigrant with 11 children , can barely speak about his son , Gavin . <p> He sighs , shakes his head , chokes back tears , looks down . <p> " He was special , " he finally manages . " It 's so tough sometimes . " <p> Gavin Cato and his cousin Angela were playing on the sidewalk when they were hit . The car was the last in a three-car motorcade carrying the Lubavitch grand rabbi , Menachem Schneerson , home from a visit to his wife 's grave . An accident expert later concluded the driver lost control after accelerating to stay with the motorcade . <p> Blacks began beating the driver , Yosef Lifsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulance at the scene to take the Jews away . This sparked a rumor that the Jewish ambulance refused to treat the children . The rioting began . <p> City paramedics took the children to the hospital . Angela survived ; Gavin did not . <p> Three hours later , Yankel Rosenbaum , a 29-year-old rabbinical student visiting from Australia , was fatally stabbed five blocks from where Gavin was hit . <p> Yankel 's only sibling , Norman , flew in from Melbourne two months later and visited the corner where his brother was attacked . A black woman passing by stopped to offer condolences . <p> " She told me I should never forget that these people , firstly and foremost and lastly , were criminals and murderers , " Norman says . " She told me she lived in fear herself . That day it was my brother , but the next day it could have been her and her children . She said , ' Please , do n't hate black people . ' I hate my brother 's murderers , but I certainly do not hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who treated Yankel Rosenbaum at a hospital failed to notice one of his wounds is still pending . Some blame his death on that alleged error . <p> Lemrick Nelson , 16 , the son of immigrants from Trinidad , was charged with killing Rosenbaum , but a jury acquitted him . In federal court , he was convicted of violating Rosenbaum 's civil rights . Nelson is serving 20 years in prison , along with another man , Charles Price , who was videotaped egging on the rioters . <p> Meanwhile , a grand jury declined to charge the driver , Lifsh , who moved to Israel . <p> " What angered people , particularly in the African-American community , was the sense that there was a double standard , " says the Rev. Al Sharpton , an activist who eulogized Gavin . <p> On the other side , many Lubavitchers believe the city failed to protect them . <p> " It was the first pogrom in America , " says Rabbi Beryl Epstein . <p> Former Mayor David Dinkins , who was showered with rocks and bottles when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Many people to this day think the driver of the car should have been prosecuted . But it was an accident , " he says . <p> As for the Lubavitch contention , Dinkins says , " the police did not do the job they should have done ... But a pogrom as I understand it is a state-sponsored activity . And this was not such . " <p> In July 1993 , a state investigation concluded that Dinkins " did not act in a timely and decisive manner in requiring the police department to ... protect the lives , safety and property of the residents of Crown Heights . " <p> Four months after the investigation , Dinkins , the city 's first black mayor , lost the mayoralty to Rudolph Giuliani by just 60,000 votes out of 1.7 million cast . Giuliani 's campaign ads included this attack on Dinkins : " Then he becomes mayor and we get ... the Crown Heights riots ... and all David Dinkins says is , ' It 's not my fault . " ' <p> Slavery . Immigration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Africa , the Caribbean and Eastern Europe to become neighbors in Crown Heights . <p> Emancipated slaves first settled the area in the 1830s . Caribbean immigrants began arriving in the early 1900s , and they are still coming . A third of blacks in Crown Heights today claim West Indian heritage . <p> Lubavitchers fleeing persecution moved to Crown Heights in the 1940s , establishing their international headquarters . The refugees included Schneerson , who became their spiritual leader or " rebbe " in 1950 . <p> Crown Heights was 70 percent white - mostly non-Lubavitch - until the 1960s , when it became 70 percent black . But Schneerson condemned white flight as immoral , and Lubavitchers stayed put . Today the neighborhood is roughly 10 percent white , and most of those whites are Lubavitch . <p> Blacks and Jews lead separate lives here . Yes , they live side by side , poorer families in apartment buildings , the middle-class on leafy blocks in century-old homes . But Lubavitch families speak Yiddish and pray in Hebrew ; they eat only kosher food and do n't watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear black hats and coats , children attend religious schools . <p> Black teen-agers play basketball in playgrounds . Spicy jerk chicken roasts in a barrel outside a Caribbean luncheonette . Black physicians occupy stately houses on " Doctors Row . " <p> Efforts continue to bridge the divide . <p> A black-owned karate school is creating a self-defense class for Lubavitch women at the request of a rabbi . Rabbi Hecht dreams of a high-tech center where blacks and Jews can run businesses side by side . <p> And a Jewish Children 's Museum is being built on Eastern Parkway in the hope that it will be visited by " every child , regardless of race , color or creed , " says Devorah Halberstam , who created it in honor of her son , Ari , murdered three years after the riots by a Lebanese immigrant who shot up a van carrying Lubavitch boys . <p> If kids learn about Judaism , she says , " all of a sudden it does n't sound so weird or strange . It adds a certain kind of acceptance . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Crown Heights Youth Collective - most of them black - to visit the museum . <p> Green remembers when Ari was shot . " I went to St. Vincent 's Hospital personally , " recalls the black community activist . " Why ? Because it was a youth from Crown Heights . " <p> After the riots , the Rev. Paul Chandler , who is black , and David Lazerson , a Lubavitch teacher , organized basketball games for black and Jewish teen-agers , along with an interracial band called Dr. Laz and the Cure . <p> Rebbe Schneerson , who gave a dollar for charity to anyone who sought his advice , gave Chandler and Laz two dollars : A double blessing for their venture . <p> " He understood that skin color , somebody 's religion , all that stuff is superficial , " Lazerson says . <p> The games were not without controversy . Rabbi Hecht did n't believe the kids should spend their time playing basketball . " Maybe if it was chess games , it would be different . " <p> Still , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that , you know what ? The possibility does exist that we can work together . " <p> Then the teens grew up , Laz moved to Florida and the games ended . But Dr. Laz and the Cure will reunite Aug. 19 , to perform at an event on the 10th anniversary of the riots . <p> The event , jointly planned by blacks and Jews , will commemorate " all the attempts to reconcile differences " since the riots , says Ben-Tzion Meltzer , who is heading the effort . <p> " The irony and the sad part , " Chandler says , " is that we had to lose two people to begin a deeper dialogue and a better understanding .
