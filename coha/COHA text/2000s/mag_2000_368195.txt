Night had fallen over the dusty city of Luoyang , and the agents who call themselves the Secret Service Christians were ready to commence their most dangerous mission yet , to disperse 60 Americans into the Chinese hinterlands to spread the word of God covertly . Wendy Lawson , a member of the South Hills Assembly of God Church in Bethel Park , Pa. , was trained for the Tract Bombers , the Service 's most elite force . After a bruising half-day journey to get to the central Chinese city , the 51-year-old paramedic tucked her fair hair under a hat and crammed 300 religious pamphlets into the secret pockets of a custom-made vest . Then , from near midnight to the first glimmering of dawn , she and a posse of evangelists wandered down alleys in small-town China , stuffing mailboxes , bicycle baskets and window sills with their religious contraband . " When the people woke up the next morning , " she says , " there was Jesus everywhere . " <P> While U.S. businesses are busy trying to capture the country 's 1.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese souls .

Some Chinese , many elderly and disenfranchised , have taken to Falun Gong , the outlawed meditation group that spooked the nation 's leadership by quietly mobilizing more than 10,000 people for a mass protest in Beijing last year . Other seekers of spirituality , mostly younger and more attuned to Western influences , have converted to Christianity . Two decades ago , shortly after the antireligion fervor of the Cultural Revolution , only 2 million Chinese identified themselves as Christian . Today the number is nearly 60 million , according to overseas Christian groups  --  about the same number as the official membership of China 's Communist Party . <P> Beijing has paid lip service to the burgeoning spiritual movement by encouraging believers to join its state-supported Christian church . ( The government sanctions five carefully monitored religious organizations . ) In a prelude to the Millennium World Peace Summit in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maintained that " there is no religious persecution in China . " Yet his statement came just days after the arrests of nearly 200 Christians . The raids also snared three American evangelists , who were deported to the U.S.
