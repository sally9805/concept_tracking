In my youth , I dressed up and pretended to be Jack Nicklaus . I had a couple of advantages when I was 12 , like a squeaky voice , and the fact that in the early 1970s it was okay for a kid to wear the absurdly flared polyester nut-squeezers favored by Tour players . ( Looking back , the tightness of Jack Nicklaus ' trousers might well account for the fact that I had a total lack of pubic hair until I was 27 , and why I can still yodel with the best of them . ) In the deadly serious world of the 12-year-old Tour player , getting first pick in the hero role-playing department was a lot more important than who got to hit first . The name Nicklaus struck fear into the quivering spleen of Lee Trevino , who had a speech impediment and only four clubs , and positively pureed the bowels of Gary Player , whose mom used to drag him squealing off the course by his ear if he had n't done his homework . Being Jack usually meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , because Jack had to be graceful in defeat , which was tough to pull off when Arnold Palmer was dancing gleefully around the 18th green , flashing you his pimply bum . As I recall , Tom Weiskopf could be a complete swine , too . Then I grew up ( okay , that 's crap ) and turned pro , and after several years of desperately chopping my way around every Nicklaus course I played , I began to think my childhood hero was a landscape gardener on acid . Every time I set foot on the first tee of one of Jack 's golf courses I lost 70 points off my IQ , and my confidence hit the deck faster than Paris Hilton 's pants . I decided that this could n't possibly be MY fault : there was an obvious design flaw in Jack 's work , a theory I frequently shared with the tabloid pencil-squeezers with whom I drank after such disasters . Feherty 's play was usually more quotable than notable , and I became known as a Nicklaus-basher . But I never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely I 'd have to look the man in the eye , right ? Uh , wrong . I moved to America and started to play badly on every golf course . I evaporated into broadcasting and then , before I knew it , found myself sweating like a vole in a toaster as I waited to INTERVIEW Jack Bloody Nicklaus . When he sat down beside me he might as well have had one giant sky-blue Orwellian orb in the middle of his damn forehead : in that instant I felt Nicklaus knew every damn thing about me . But the man did n't even have the decency to get shirty with me . He was warm and friendly and funny , even endearing in a Golf-God-like way . I felt like a mean-spirited little crab in the presence of a really nice dolphin . Okay , that last sentence was a bit weird , but it worked for me . Moving right along , I need to say this : I actually love Jack Nicklaus , and I have since I was a little boy . You love him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest winner of all time , and more importantly the greatest loser , and best of all , he had the decency not to retire at the top , so that we could all see that he is human after all . The decline of Jack 's game has been sweetly painful for every golf fan , his occasional flashes of glories past have been magnificent rages against the dying of the brightest light in golf . God , I wish that I had played with him just one time . In my career I got to play with almost every great player in the modern era , but never with Jack . In my current sate of perfection , I probably could n't play a round if Stryker Orthopedics gave me free ceramic hips and a year 's supply of Percodan . ( It 's the pain , you know , from a debilitating pelvic condition diagnosed by my doctor as " there 's nothing wrong with you , you whiner , and , no , you ca n't have any more narcotics . " ) Jack Nicklaus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last card in my royal flush , and probably the only person on the planet who might be able to lure me back onto a golf course . Even if it was one of his .
