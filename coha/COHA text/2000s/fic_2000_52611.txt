NOT QUITE HALFWAY THROUGH my husband 's twelve-week stint away from home , I have hauled out the featherbed and started sleeping on the floor , with my two dogs . I know how pathetic this sounds , so I make a face at myself when I tell friends , when I talk about plucking fur from my nightgown . The truth is , I like sleeping with the dogs . Firm and warm , they give off in sleep a reassuring smell that reminds me of buttered toast . Sometimes I press my face against the bedding later in the day to get another whiff of that rich , clean scent . <p> For two weeks after my husband left our home in Ohio to go to Alabama , I entered his closet and inhaled , sucking in the remnant odors of his soap and sharp-sweet aftershave . But after five weeks , his smells are gone , and I 'm sleeping with the dogs . <p> It 's only pathetic if I make it so . Not surprisingly , I often do . <p> The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence only lasted a month . He had been granted a stay at Yaddo , the artists ' colony , an ideal opportunity to get cracking on a new book . He presented the idea to me carefully , but I agreed that he should go . I 've had such residencies myself , and know what a boon they are . Nevertheless , I wailed through every minute of his time away . The days , as I recall , were filled with a keening wind , and he can still pull out the letters I sent , crammed with complaint . <p> It 's hard now to figure out where I found the time to write letters . I hired people to clean the windows and carpets , and I paste-waxed the dining-room table , washed and starched the curtains , and scrubbed out the fireplace  --  the only time I 've performed any of these chores . I washed the dog  --  there was only one then  --  and played fetch with her for forty-five minutes every afternoon . At night , catalogs in hand , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to two thousand dollars , a sum that still astonishes me , particularly since I ca n't remember most of what I bought . <p> Meanwhile , I went to work and church and the gym , had dinner with friends . I also wrote a short story about a widow . Looking back , I get tired just watching myself . <p> This time around , I have nothing like that kind of zip . My pool of energy daily grows shallower , and sometimes by seven at night I 'm drooping from the demands of one job and two dogs , demands that are hardly exceptional . Basic household chores open like sinkholes beneath me  --  I still have n't brought the plumbing snake up from the garage to attack the sluggish drain in my bathtub , have n't put the recommended ounce of fuel stabilizer in the lawn mower 's gas tank . Winter is coming on , but I have n't turned off the water to the outside spigots , or so much as touched a rake . The eagerness to prove myself that propelled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a thin , reluctant , trudging sense of duty . <p> And duty tends to march side by side with resentment , a remarkably sure-footed and willing companion . Resentment , at least in my company , never gropes for words , and is quick to offer its interpretation of events . In a confidential , husky voice , resentment sighs and commiserates and murmurs its consolations . Those silky blandishments wind around my brain . You 're doing so much speedily gives way to You should n't have to do so much , and before I know it , I 've been waltzing with resentment all day . So one of my recurrent tasks , along with watering the windowsill plants and fetching the mail , is shoving back resentment again and again and again . <p> I did agree to this separation . However much I could kick myself now , when my husband was offered a visiting appointment for a semester at the University of Alabama , I nodded . Of course , yes . And truly , I would say yes again today . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the faint , complicated voice of new work under the din of classes he has to teach , papers he has to grade , meetings that run for hours . I agreed he should go because I could see how much he needed the time , and knew that I would want him to give me the same support , as I 'm utterly sure he would . <p> Reminding myself of this does n't do a thing to hold off self-pity when it sweeps over me like thunderclouds , giving my days the dreary emotional weather of bad nineteenth-century novels . But I have n't run up a big Visa bill , and I 'm certainly not going in for pathological cleaning . What worries me is that we 've got over six weeks yet to go , and peculiar things are happening . <p> A dime-sized patch of eczema , a condition I 've never had before , has developed on my big toe . I keep stumbling on familiar stairs or perfectly even pavement . And last week , when I glanced at the locker-room mirror after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left a lurid arc of bruises around each eye-I looked like somebody 'd popped me good . <p> " Strange , " my doctor said , pressing gently on the bruises . Ultimately , unable to figure a cause , she told me to cut back on aspirin , and gave me cream for the eczema . From her office I went to the makeup counter at a department store and bought E-race , guaranteed to cover any shadows , blemishes , or unsightly marks . I should have gone there in the first place . <p> I have a theory about why the bruises appeared , and it is n't strictly physiological : The body can go gently ( or not so gently ) haywire during separations from our loved ones . I know a man who , newly abandoned by his lover , started asking people to repeat themselves and turned the radio in his car up so loud the dashboard vibrated ; at twenty-eight , he had to get a hearing aid . If all I have to deal with is bruises , I 'm getting off easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know my husband is coming home , and I know when . Among grass widows , I 'm in a lofty position . I know this because I 've also been the other kind of grass widow , the one whose husband wo n't come back . I kept my hearing , but my hair turned gray . <p> After my divorce from my first husband , I tried to embrace my new status and retool myself as a single gal . I hung colored lights around my curtainless windows , bought zany shoes and a dozen windup toys to to keep on the kitchen table . I kept shoving myself in the direction of a charming , feckless , childlike abandon , became a Holly Golightly wannabe . <p> But every time I pushed myself , something in me pushed back , and harder . I was no child ; I was a divorced woman . I was a matter of public record . On every form that asked my marital status , I reaffirmed , along with my creditworthiness or my right to hold a library card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was humiliated by my zebrastriped shoes and bright toys . I swiped the kitchen table clear and felt cramped , dim single life close around me like a glove . <p> Never , even when I was a moody teenager , have I craved a zesty single life , with many beaux , and days lived entirely to my own measure . The idea of a woman alone made me think of my two divorced aunts from one side of the family and one maiden aunt from the other , women 1 saw at holidays and family events when I was a girl . I registered their presence as dire examples : their exhausted cars , the castoff armchairs they took from my parents ' house , their splayed , veiny legs . Warned by their stolid expressions , I made up my mind to be wedded . I plunged into marriage when I was twenty-three , certain that union , whatever union I could forge , was better than the alternative . <p> Seven years later , I carried away from the marriage some debt , some furniture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wisdom that the relieved twenty-three-year-old bride could n't have imagined : not to be chosen might be better , after all , than to be selected but then to fail , to topple from a life in union with someone else to a life lived relentlessly alone . <p> Every day now I file away perceptions , details , worries , the textures of dailiness to share with my husband on the phone or in letters . Sometimes I even jot down notes , but then I feel embarrassed that I need to take notes on my own life , so I throw them out and rely on the list in my head . <p>  --  One of the dogs seemed to be limping , but he looks OK now .  --  When do we need to have the furnace cleaned ?  --  The neighbors ' bank of chrysanthemums has come into bloom . The flowers are bright orange with yellow eyes , stunning , and you 're missing them . <p> Every detail and question I save for my husband is a strand thrown out to strengthen the rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to care about chrysanthemums or the furnace . I may wake up with dogs and eat dinner by myself , but my life is joined to another 's . He will come home . <p> The faith is n't necessarily easy to hold . Peel back even slightly my layer of daily resentment , and a selection of more unattractive emotions foams up : fear , panic , grief  --  emotions that undermine my best attempts to be stalwart . Their wheedling , whispery voices swirl when I carry my half-full garbage can to the corner , or take one bowl and one spoon from the cupboard for dinner . This is how it will be , my weird sisters say . When he is gone . Your life small , small , small . <p> I can ignore the voices , but I ca n't stop hearing them . They sing from the seams and pockets of my system , and so hr no kind of psychological ripping or plucking has dislodged them . You will be alone , they trill . Prepare yourself . <p> A close friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband engaged in a several-months-long research project overseas . Neither of us likes the sour state we find ourselves occupying , but we sustain each other , entertain each other , talk about collaborating on a survival guide for the married and lovelorn . Last week she called to confess she 'd stayed up to watch Sleepless in Seattle and wept through the whole thing . <p> " Uh-oh , " I said . " Light romantic comedy . That 's a whole chapter : Movies to Avoid . You should have watched Patton . " <p> " I knew it was a bad idea . But I was already walking around the house , looking at his chair , his books . I figured , what the hell . In for a penny , in for a pound . " <p> " So you cried all night ? " <p> " Not all night . I stopped around three . " <p> " Stalag 17 , " I told her . " Bridge on the River Kwai . " <p> She must have been very gratified when I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grimly saw in the dawn after getting hooked by a sweet , idiotic , light romantic comedy . Touring the TV channels , I stumbled across a scene in which Robert Downey Jr . pursued a fleet-footed nymph wearing a spectacular red dress across the streets of Rome . <p> I told myself I would stay with the movie just long enough to get a good look at the dress , but of course I was already done for . Standing at the Trevi Fountain , slinging a convertible around mountain roads , hustling through airports , Robert Downey Jr . pledged never to leave his nymph 's side , and I watch every blessed minute . Before the movie was halfway over I was prowling the living room , plucking at my clothes and the backs of my hands as if I could lift my skin away . Though it was past ten by the time the credits rolled , I grabbed my purse and barreled to a bookstore that stays open late , where I spent a frenzied half-hour finding nothing I wanted to read . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repeating disjointed scraps of dialogue from the movie as if it had been written by Elia Kazan . I made a sandwich , ate one bite , and fed the rest to the delighted dogs . I opened a beer , a diet Coke , and the bottle of Glenlivet , and did n't make a dent in any of them . Finally giving up every last wisp of dignity , I climbed the stairs to the bedroom , opened my closet , and tried on the dress I 'd worn at my wedding . It still fit , I tonelessly reported to my friend the next day . <p> " You put on your wedding dress ? That 's way worse than watching Sleepless in Seattle . " <p> " I 'm not proud of myself , OK ? " <p> " For Pete 's sake . Do n't look at wedding pictures . Do n't play the music you danced to . Do n't go anywhere near your wedding dress . What would you have done if it had n't fit ? " " Killed myself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Steer clear of booze , and get some pretzels . Complex carbohydrates are good . " <p> I hung up feeling better . I always feel better after I talk to her . We 're a couple of dames together , chewing gum and cracking wise  --  leftovers from precisely the kind of ' 40s romantic movie that neither of us should watch until our husbands come home . We both understand this . We rarely bother to articulate how much it helps to know that each of us is coping with her loneliness and fear approximately as gracelessly as the other . <p> We talk every day , sometimes twice . My husband and I talk at least twice , often more . Alabama to Ohio , Ohio to Florida , Florida to Ohio . The phone bills are stratospheric , but none of us is slowing down , even though the calls are often lackluster , one party or the other yawning , distracted , depressed , rushing out the door for a class or a meeting . Even in these imperfect circumstances , we would rather hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up a telephone and simply talk gives us the illusion of nearness . We want to be reminded of domestic conversations , which wind comfortably from room to room across hours or days . But phone calls , hatefully , have firm endings , and the moment I hang up , silence tumbles over me again . <p> Normally I like quiet , even seek it out : Once a year , at a monastery near my house , I make a silent retreat . At those times I look forward to the peace that silence brings , the relief from demands and ambition , the opportunity to remake my own acquaintance . But what I 'm wearing now is the silence of absence , not of choice . This stillness is a bully ; it prods me , then engulfs any measly sounds I can make . If I rattle pans in the kitchen or pull out the vacuum cleaner-not that I have pulled out the vacuum cleaner  --  silence waits to swamp me again the moment I stop moving . Perversely , I resist turning on the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn it off and hear the silence flood back in . Silence is no-life , and it fills my house . <p> The dogs do their bit to create companionable noise , going off like air-raid sirens whenever a jogger puffs past . I 'm grateful to them . They pad from room to room , dropping near-gelatinous lumps of chewed rawhide at my feet . When a letter from my husband arrives , I hold it down so they can sniff it . <p> No genius is required to figure out what I 'm doing here . My desire to share the letter with them is the same impulse that drives a young mother to hold a photo in front of the milky , unfocused eyes of her two-month-old and say , " That 's Daddy , see ? Your daddy . " Like that lonely mother , I 'm instructing the dogs and reminding myself that this life without my husband , however long it 's been going on , is not our real life . These days are unfortunate , temporary , unrepresentative . The letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real life , the part that counts . <p> After sniffing the letter , the dogs wander into the kitchen , checking whether anything interesting hit the floor since their last tour . If they could shrug , they would ; a letter means nothing to them , and reality is what they can see and sniff and taste . Every day that we wake up on the featherbed , without my husband , is just as real as the days I wake up beside him  --  a fact obvious even to dogs . Nevertheless , I resist . I want to fence this time off , call it an aberration , make it a footnote for some reader who , like me , does n't read footnotes . <p> I suspect that the impulse to blot days from the record is common to women stripped of their spouses , and accounts for the notorious reputation of grass widows  --  the sense of careless women , loose ones , women willing to lie down in the grass . The phrase originated in the nineteenth century , when any sensible woman took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who rode into town with a man and no chaperone , a woman who might , in fact , lie down in the grass , was either insensible or convinced that the time until her husband 's return was time off the clock , when the rules were suspended . Grass widow also implies goodtime girl , a rollicker , one who has tried conventionality and did n't find it to her liking . <p> If this is my chance to kick over the traces , I 'm doing a pretty sorry job of it . I 'm going to bed by eleven , getting up every morning on time . For one of the rare periods in my life , I 'm eating reasonably , neither gorging on cheese and butter nor whipping myself through famished weeks on nine hundred calories a day . I 'm dressing in dull skirts and flat shoes . Waiting , waiting , waiting . <p> So when a well-meaning colleague with a wistful glint in her eye says she 'd love to have her house to herself , and know , for once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm as jarred as if she had confessed a lifelong yearning to lick strychnine . This is n't something you want , I nearly tell her . But people see mines of happiness in the lives they do n't get to lead . I think about my colleague 's husband and three children and imagine their daily domestic collisions  --  socks unsorted on the stairs , the refrigerator door covered with gleeful construction-paper cutouts . My yearning for such a noisy , cheerful household briefly makes my throat thicken . I should n't be surprised that others look at my uncluttered refrigerator and stairs and envision paradise . <p> If I 'm fair  --  which , of course , I do n't want to be  --  I 'll admit that people have been kind , rallying around to invite me to dinner and movies . Generally I accept , although my heart sags . Many of these invitations come from couples I know only remotely , at the level of collegial greetings in the hall , and I know that their offers to share a meal or check out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even when the evenings are pleasant , as they often are , I ca n't dodge the sense that I 've become a good deed . When these generous people press me to take home food , I remember my unmarried aunts at our house for Thanksgiving , the foil-wrapped packets of turkey and dressing they tucked into their huge purses . I smile and back away . Very kind , but-no , really , I 'd never be able to eat it . That much is true , anyway . <p> Perhaps as a nervous response to this lopsided socializing , I 've entered another phase of small injuries . Twice in a week I tripped and fell while walking the dogs , and the plastic handle of their leash keeps banging my knuckle . It 's dug a sore that 's gotten infected . " Are you taking care of yourself ? " my husband frets . " You do n't sound like you 're taking care of yourself . " Good thing he ca n't see me  --  the bruises from the goggles are back , worse this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious . There seems to be some hint of volition about the falls , something nastily passive-aggressive . Am I letting myself trip on the sidewalk in order to afflict my husband with tardy guilt , to make him fly to my side and swear never to leave me again ? The thought is undignified . <p> When we talk in the evening he lets me know how well his work is progressing ; he means , I know , to assure me that this separation is achieving the hoped-for end . I respond by telling him about all the untended chores around the house  --  the bald patch the dogs have dug in the carpet , the chipped paint on the baseboards . Every word out of my mouth sounds snippy and pursed . I would happily leave myself to go to Alabama for twelve weeks . <p> Besides , it would be a pleasure to get out of here : The house is , literally , gathering dust around me . I have n't moved a single item my husband forgot to put away , not even an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use his typewriter , I do n't move any scrap or letter . I feel like Miss Havisham . <p> Still , here and there , changes are creeping in . I 've started to grade papers at the table he usually keeps heaped with mail and half-finished projects . The cupboard that used to hold his cereal is now stashed with my graham crackers and rice cakes . Little by little , I 'm uncovering details of our life that have been arranged for his convenience , and I 'm rearranging them for my own . And even though I 've only claimed a table and a cupboard , the action feels rash . <p> The patterns and arrangements people live by have significance , and there 's no telling what kind of power we might unleash once we start changing things . A woman I know waited three years after her husband 's death before she moved his desk from its place beside the nicest window in the house and installed her own desk there . Then , she said , she could n't even go into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk to its original place . " I felt as though I 'd killed him , " she said . I do n't think she was exaggerating ; his closet still holds all his clothes . <p> Now the cupboards and furniture in the house hold a thin film of threat . Every shift I make , however slight , however defensible , points toward betrayal , the substitution of my single life for our life together . And the fear of betrayal is the obliterating cloud that hovers between couples living apart . <p> On this subject my husband and I are very , very careful with each other . We come home early from parties , and call when we get in . We are quick to point out how no one around us is so delightful , or charming , or sexy , or bright as the beloved absent one . Only once , the wretched night of the Robert Downey Jr . movie , have I imagined my husband pursuing another woman , and even on that overwrought occasion I stopped myself : I knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked on medieval maps Here be monsters . I know I have no reason to doubt my husband 's faithfulness . But there are all kinds of betrayals . <p> I imagine him flying into a rage when he discovers that I 've billeted graham crackers in his cupboard . When I talk to him in the evening and hear his easy , affectionate voice , I 'm embarrassed for conjuring this monstrous anti-husband in his place . But a day or two later , when I move his sugar bowl to a high shelf where I 'm less likely to tip it , the sound of his furious voice roars again through my brain , accusing me of treating our life together like trash . <p> " You 've got to come home , " I tell him . <p> " Soon , " he says . " Trust me . I 'll be back before you know it . " <p> I smile unhappily at the phone . He wants to console me , and I want to be consoled . I do n't want to waste our precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day locked in battles with a fabricated , lunatic version of him . As far as I can tell , he does n't spend his time engaged in make-believe strife with an imagined me  --  but then , he 's the one who 's away , in a house and city that are n't saturated with our habits and memories , furniture and cupboards . <p> " I 'll be home soon , " my husband says . The connection is n't great , and his voice crackles . " I miss you . Do you hear me ? " <p> " We ca n't ever do this again , " I say , and he has the good sense not to answer . We both know that his next residency , two years from now , is already on the books . <p> One of the things two marriages have taught me is how wrong I was , as a girl , to assume that marriage meant safe harbor . One way or another , for short periods or for keeps , marriages end . If I want to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband tomorrow and find an apartment where the cupboards will hold a single can of tomato sauce , one plate and fork and cup . If I want safety , I should take myself out of harm 's way . Why did it take me so long to understand this basic point ? Marriage is risk . <p> Because grass widowhood is merely rehearsal for the real thing : the big silence , the long sorrow . I ponder how many of the men in my husband 's family have died young . I am nearly seven years younger than he is , and I carry the braided blood of two families whose women sailed effortlessly into their nineties . I 'm only forty , but my eyes compulsively strain toward the future , and see that narrow cupboard , that single fork . The image is ridiculously romantic , a parody of the solitary life . But understanding that does n't stop me from seeing it . <p> At night I listen to the dogs ' untroubled breathing . When my husband comes home they 'll yodel and knock each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other into another room and forget he was ever gone . For the two of us , his return wo n't be so easy . We 've got three months ' worth of new attitudes and perceptions to work into our common life , a stretch of separate experiences that will never be completely absorbed . The skin of our marriage will bear a small scar right here , where we 've had to bring the two edges back together . <p> Eventually , of course , I 'll get caught up in the usual round of activities and chores . Spun into some tempest at work , I 'll spend weeks hardly noticing my husband . But then a couple that has always seemed loving and solid will announce their divorce , or another friend 's husband will receive a solitary travel grant , or a cousin will call me late at night , weeping . <p> When I get off the phone I 'll go lie beside my husband and stroke his fingers and sides , though I know he does n't like to be twiddled at . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't share my absolute conviction that happiness attracts sorrow . So although he 'll sling out an arm to pull me close , I 'll be only half comforted , holding myself slightly apart from him . Stubbornly I 'll remind myself to note and catch hold of our happiness now , which matches the happiness of the days that have gone before ; tomorrow , or the day after , it will certainly vanish . <p> <p> By Erin McGraw <p>
