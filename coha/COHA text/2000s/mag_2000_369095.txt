Jonda Cynecki has n't seen her twin sister Wanda in 13 years and does n't hold out much hope that she ever will . Their last contact came at a family gathering in Ohio for Christmas , after which Wanda returned to her home in Key West , Fla . Then she disappeared . She did n't call , did n't write and could n't be reached . When her parents died several years later , her siblings had to use intermediaries to get through to her . She called to borrow money about a year ago . Since then , the only sign she 's still alive is that no one has heard anything to the contrary . And yet Jonda , 54 , a school librarian , says wistfully of Wanda , " There is n't a day that goes by that something does n't remind me of her . " <P> Usually that something is doing the laundry . Whenever Jonda goes down to her basement to wash clothes , she sees , tucked under the stairs , an old tandem stroller . Her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped rubber around its wooden wheels .

At the same time , boomers have more divorces and fewer children and are less tethered to neighbors than were their parents and grandparents , so they are more in need of strong relationships with sisters and brothers  --  the most-enduring ties many of us have in our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sibling , yet an estimated 3% to 10% have completely severed contact with a brother or sister . <P> Such absolute estrangements may not be the norm , but experts who study family relationships believe they are on the rise . Psychologist Carol Netzer , author of Cutoffs : How Family Members Who Sever Relationships Can Reconnect , thinks that today 's broader cultural freedoms have made it easier for people to say goodbye to traditions and to relatives . " The nuclear family is not as tight as it once was , " she says . Some rifts reflect larger trends . The Woodstock generation , Netzer explains , was full of young people leaving their families to lose themselves in drugs or join religious groups , political movements and communes . " Often , when that ripple in the culture passes , " says Netzer , " people go back to their families .
