Smart ideas for small spaces , plus the hottest spots to buy or build a getaway Photograph The red chaise is Yvonne Neumann 's favorite spot to curl up with a book . Sliding glass doors open a corner of the living area to the patio . // Getting back to nature Long before he went to architecture school . Andy Neumann ' was a champion surfer . So it 's no wonder he refers to his 800square-foot , solar-powered retreat as " the surf shack . " The strongly geometric cube-shaped cabin , located 2 miles up a canyon in California 's Central Coast , packs a lot of design ideas-from storage walls to a hearth-desk-into a compact space overlooking a creek in rolling , oak-studded ranchland . Photograph With storage and display shelves resembling large egg crates , the wall system defines the kitchen , dining , and living areas . The ladder leads to a sleeping loft . // " I had the luxury of camping here for three years and taking my time to get a bead on my design , " says Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I knew I wanted to experience the outdoors while being sheltered in an uncomplicated way . " The kitchen/living/dining area and enclosed bathroom occupy the cube ; a bedroom is attached to one side like a saddlebag . The shedlike main roof is actually two triangular planes forming a trough that echoes the canyon slope and channels runoff to a salvaged anchor chain . Sliding window walls on four sides and at a corner of the living area open the house to the landscape . The remote site is in a high fire-risk zone , so Andy used noncombustive building materials ( including 10-inch-thick plasterand-metal lath walls that are the color of the earth ) and eliminated roof overhangs , a common transfer point for wildfires . Electric power is generated by solar panels on top of the south-facing detached , one-car garage . Largecapacity military-surplus batteries are used to store the energy , eliminating the need for a generator . The cabin 's mechanical systems are in the garage , which keeps the main living quarters tranquil . Propane powers a very quiet refrigerator and stove , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors . Photograph In good weather , the patio is the dining room . Paved with squares of adobe , it blends into the surrounding landscape , further helping to tie the house to its site . // The layout of the cabin exemplifies Andy 's pared-down aesthetic . " My brother-in-law built me a large maple ' box ' that I pushed into the corner , " he says . The outside wall of the box contains cubicles for kitchen storage and books . Inside is a bathroom and walk-in closet : on top is a study/loft with two beds . The cabin is both a launchpad for surfing and a place to relax in the rugged landscape . As for the sleek geometry . Andy says , " It honors the spirit of freedom that drew me here in the first place .

" Sometimes we 'll also hear the screams of mountain lions or see the footprints of a bear we call Oscar , " Neal says . Their metal-clad cabin sits near Grouse Ridge in the Sierra Nevada , about 6,500 feet above sea level and about 30 miles from Nevada City , California . Its exterior design is simple and functional , since it must deal with heavy snow loads , provide fire resistance , and also be able to lock securely . Architect David Wright based its shape and metal surfaces on U.S. Forest Service maintenance buildings that dot the area . The 980-square-foot structure is " off the grid , " thanks to an array of photovoltaic panels that store the electricity in a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerator , and a pump , while a woodstove heats the interior . The cabin is sturdy and exceptionally energy efficient , because it uses Structural Insulated Panels ( SIPs ) in the walls and roof . ( The precut panels helped speed the construction of the cabin , which had a limited window of time in midsummer for the contractor to build it . ) The SIPs make the house so well insulated that in five years , the Mitchells have used only 1 cords of wood for heat . The precut panels for the walls and roof cost $24,875 from Better Building Systems ( www.betterbuilding.com or 530/ 477-8017 ) .

Neal telecommutes to his office in the Silicon Valley , thanks to a laptop and cell phone . He also enjoys a projection DVD player . " On nice summer nights , we set up a screen on our porch and show outdoor movies , " he says . That 's roughing it the modern way . - PETER O.

When Russ and his wife , Barbara , bought it , the cabin had one great thing going for it : Flathead Lake lay just a few yards from their front yard . Lots of unglamorous but necessary tasks , like installing a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the final phase . " We could only stand up in the middle of the old attic-it was like being in a tunnel , " Barbara says . By adding a pair of peaked dormers , the couple gained room for a new master bath and a tall sitting area with lake views . The upstairs also gained a master bedroom , sewing area , and storage space . " The closest hardware store was more than an hour away , so we made a lot of things ourselves , " says Russ , who ripped all the lap siding and helped fabricate the trim . Mark Sauer , a contractor from nearby Somers , helped them through their remodel , which respects the style of the original structure . " Now we call it Nap Ranch , " Barbara says . - PETER O.
