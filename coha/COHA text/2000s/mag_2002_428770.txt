How to trim a decade-with nothing but scissors ! Haircuts that work wonders . // There 's no denying it : Your hair and face change as you get older . And so should your cut , because falling into a hair rut ( quick test : have you changed your style in the past five years ? ) will age you faster than you can say , " I 'll take a Dorothy Hamill . " Finding the right cut and color can give a huge boost to your overall appearance , says New York City stylist Mark Garrison , who did the amazing makeovers shown here . Nervous about radical change ? Then think smaller , says Garrison : " You can stick with your favorite style , but update it in little ways . " The trick is to work with a stylist who focuses on three key factors : your bone structure , hair texture , and preferred maintenance level ( how much time you 're willing to spend on daily styling ) . Cover those bases and you 're on your way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too severe , " Garrison says . A long bob with bangs can be flattering , but her particular cut lacked shape and movement .

In her words : Photograph Maryellen Hays , 60 // " I looked like a mushroom ! " WHY THIS CUT WORKS " Softer bangs combined with length at the nape and fullness at the crown flatter her oval face and really bring out her cheekbones , " Garrison says . " We also gave her warm , caramel  --  colored highlights around the face , being careful not to go too light , which can wash some women out . " WHAT YOU CAN DO Remember that flat-against  --  the-head rarely means pretty , unless you 're 16 . We all need a little lift around our faces-from layers , styling , or color-to get that extra zing .

" WHY THIS CUT WORKS Garrison snipped off the frazzled ends and gave Malena a sexy bob that brings out her gorgeous bone structure . As for color , " the beauty is in the contrast , " says Garrison , whose colorist combined a light brown base with golden highlights in front . WHAT YOU CAN DO Take a good look in the mirror . Does your hair color mimic your skin tone ? If so , you may look washed out , especially in the winter . Choose a base color that 's at least two shades darker than your skin tone , even if your hair is blond . If you crave a lighter look , go for highlights .

Sidebar Your perfect cut starts here Sidebar How to choose the style that 's right for you Sidebar YOUR GOAL To fight sagging TRY Layering . " A completely blunt cut makes the face look longer , as if it has succumbed to gravity , " says James Ekeler , of New York 's TwoDo Salon . " Instead , try longer bangs that hit at your cheekbones-this will give you a visual face-lift . " YOUR GOAL To firm up the jawline TRY At least nape-length layers that are shorter in back . Adding some swing this way helps minimize flaws in general , and longer pieces in front will give the illusion of angles where they 're needed . YOUR GOAL To emphasize good features TRY Cutting layers that " point " towards the area by ending at the same level . If you have a great smile , for example , ask for chin-length pieces in front that will hit at lip level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( think Goldie Hawn ) . They 'll cover lines and play up your eyes . YOUR GOAL To sculpt cheekbones TRY Creating volume at the crown . Ask for layers on top . Then , when styling , take a few strokes with a teasing comb ( easy-we 're not talking Marge Simpson ) five inches from the hairline . YOUR GOAL To downplay neck wrinkles TRY A few wispy , longer strands in the back , even if the cut is short ( see Maryellen , right ) .
