Everyone at the auction knew that the stallion was a killer . Yet two men came forward to bid against each other . <p> The stallion was named after a star , and when he fell from his particular heaven , it was easy enough for people to say that he had been named too well . People like to see stars fall , but in the case of Rigel , it was of greater importance to me . To me and to one other  --  to a little man with shabby cuffs and a wilted cap that rested over eyes made mild by something more than time . <p> It was at Newmarket , in England , where , since Charles I instituted the firs cup race , a kind of court has been held for the royalty of the turf . Men of all classes come to Newmarket for the races and for the December sales . They come from everywhere-some to bet , some to buy or sell , and some merely to offer homage to the resplendent peers of the General Stud Book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the pleasure of every man . <p> December can be bitterly cold in England , and this December was . There was frozen sleet on buildings and on trees , and I remember that the huge Newmarket track lay on the downs below the village like a noose of diamonds on a tarnished mat . There was a festive spirit everywhere , but it was somehow lost on me . I had come to buy new blood for my stable in Kenya , and since my stable was my living . I came as serious buyers do , with figures in my mind and caution in my heart . Horses are hard to judge at best , and the thought of putting your hoarded pounds behind that judgment makes it harder still . <p> I sat close on the edge of the auction ring and held my breath from time to time as the bidding soared . I held it because , at 19 , the casual mention of 10,000 guineas in payment for a horse or for anything else seemed to me widely beyond the realm of probable things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as I waited for Rigel to be shown . I remember that I felt uncommonly maternal about each pound . I waited for Rigel because I had come 6,000 miles to buy him , nor was I apprehensive lest anyone should take him from me ; he was an outcast . Rigel had a pedigree that looked backward and beyond the pedigrees of many Englishmen-and Rigel had a brilliant record . By all odds , he should have brought 10,000 guineas at the sale , but I knew he would n't , for he had killed a man . <p> He had killed a man  --  not fallen upon him , nor thrown him in a playful moment from the saddle , but killed him dead with his hoofs and with his teeth in a stable . And that was not all , though it was the greatest thing . Rigel had crippled other men and , so the story went , would cripple or kill still more , so long as he lived . He was savage , people said , and while he could not be hanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shunned as criminals are . He could be offered for sale . And yet , under the implacable rules of racing , he had been warned off the turf for life-so who would buy him ? <p> Well , I for one  --  and I had supposed there would not be two . I would buy if the price was low enough , because I had youth then , and a corresponding contempt for failure . It seemed probable that in time and with luck and with skill , the stallion might be made manageable again , if only for breeding  --  especially for breeding . He could be gentled , I thought . But I found it hard to believe what I saw that day . I had not known that the mere touch of a hand could , in an instant , extinguish the long-burning anger of an angry heart . <p> I first noticed the little man when the sale was already well on its way , and he caught my attention at once , because he was incongruous there . He sat a few benches from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees . He stared down upon the arena as each horse was led into it , and he listened to the dignified encomiums of the auctioneer with the humble attention of a parishioner at mass . He never moved . He was surrounded by men and women who , by their impeccable clothes and by their somewhat bored familiarity with pounds and guineas , made him conspicuous . He was like a stone of granite in a jeweler 's window , and like a stone , he sat , motionless and gray , against the glitter . <p> You could see in his face that he loved horses-just as you could see , in some of the faces of those around him , that they loved the idea of horses . They were the cultists , he the votary , and there were , in fact , about his gray eyes and his slender lips , the deep , tense lines so often etched in the faces of zealots and of lonely men . It was the cast of his shoulders , I think , and the devotion of his manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A yearling came into the ring and was bought , and then another , while the pages of catalogs were quietly turned . The auctioneer 's voice , clear but scarcely lifted , intoned the virtues of his magnificent merchandise as other voices , responding to his magic , spoke reservedly of figures , " A thousand guineas ... two ... three ... four ! " <p> The scene at the auction comes to me clearly now , as if once again it were happening before my eyes . <p> " Five , perhaps ? " The auctioneer scans the audience expectantly as a groom parades a dancing colt around the arena . There is a moment of near silence , a burly voice calls , " Five ! " and the colt is sold while a murmur of polite approval swells and dies . <p> And so they go , one after another , until the list is small , the audience thins , and my finger traces the name Rigel on the last page of the catalog . I straighten on my bench and hold my breath a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a part of myself . I know this horse . I know he is by Hurry On out of Bounty-the sire unbeaten , the dam a great steeplechaser  --  and there is no better blood than that . Killer or not , Rigel has won races , and won them clean . If God and Barclays Bank stay with me , he will return to Africa when I do . And there , at last , he stands . In the broad entrance to the ring , two powerful men appear with the stallion between them . The men are not grooms of ordinary size ; they have been picked for strength , and in the clenched fist of each is the end of a chain . Between the chain and the bit there is on the near side a short rod of steel , close to the stallion 's mouth-a rod of steel , easy to grasp , easy to use . Clenched round the great girth of the horse , and fitted with metal rings , there is a strap of thick leather that brings to mind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men start to edge the stallion forward . Tall as they are , they move like midgets beside his massive shoulders . He is the biggest thoroughbred that I have ever seen . He is the most beautiful . His coat is chestnut , flecked with white , and his mane and his tail are close to gold . There is a blaze on his face-wide and straight and forthright , as if by this marking he proclaims that he is none other than Rigel , for all his sins , for all the hush that begins to fall over the crowd . <p> He is Rigel and he looks upon the men who hold his chains as a captured king may look upon his captors . He is not tamed . Nothing about him promises that he will be tamed . Stiffly , on reluctant hoofs , he enters the ring and flares his crimson nostrils at the crowd , and the crowd is still . The crowd whose pleasure is the docile beast of pretty paddocks , the gainly horse of cherished prints that hang upon the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebel this crowd stares , and the rebel stares it back . <p> His eyes are lit with anger or with hate . His head is held disdainfully and high , his neck an arc of arrogance . He prances now  --  impatience in the thudding of his hoofs upon the tanbark , defiance in his manner  --  and the chains jerk tight : The long stallion reins are tightly held-apprehensively held  --  and the men who hold them glance at the auctioneer , an urgent question in their eyes . <p> The auctioneer raises his arm for silence , but there is silence . No one speaks . The story of Rigel is known  --  his breeding , his brilliant victories , and finally his insurgence and his crimes . Who will buy the outcast ? The auctioneer shakes his head as if to say that this is a trick beyond his magic . But he will try . He is an imposing man , an experienced man , and now he clears his throat and , confronts the crowd , a kind of pleading in his face . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not finish . He can not finish . <p> Rigel has scanned the silent audience and smelled the unmoving air , and he  --  a creature of the wind  --  knows the indignity of this skyless temple . He seems aware at last of the chains that hold him , of the men who cling forlornly to the heavy reins . He rears from the tanbark , higher and higher still , until his golden mane is lifted like a flag unfurled and defiant . He beats the air . <p> He trembles in his rising anger and the crowd leans forward . A groom clings like a monkey to the tightened chain . He is swept from his feet while his partner , a less tenacious man , sprawls out ignobly below , and men  --  a dozen men  --  rush to the ring , some shouting , some waving their arms . They run and swear in covered voices ; they grasp reins , chains , and rings , and swarm upon their towering Gulliver . And he subsides . <p> With something like contempt for this hysteria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has killed no one , hurt no one , but they are jabbing at his mouth now , they are surrounding him , adding fuel to his fiery reputation , and the auctioneer is a wilted man . <p> He sighs , and you can almost hear it . He raises both arms and forgoes his speech . " What , " he asks with weariness , " am I offered ? " And there is a ripple of laughter from the crowd . Smug in its wisdom , it offers nothing . <p> But I do , and my voice is like an echo in a cave . Still there is triumph in it . I will have what I have come so far to get  --  I will have Rigel : <p> " A hundred guineas ! " I stand as I call my price , and the auctioneer is plainly shocked  --  not by the meagerness of the offer , but by the offer itself . He stares upward from the ring , incredulity in his eyes . <p> He lifts a hand and slowly repeats the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " 100 guineas . " <p> There is a hush , and I feel the eyes of the crowd and watch the hand of the auctioneer . When it goes down , the stallion will be mine . <p> But it does not go down . It is still poised in mid-air , white , expectant , compelling , when the soft voice , the gently challenging voice is lifted . " Two hundred ! " the voice says , and I do not have to turn to know that the little jockey has bid against me . But I do turn . <p> He has not risen from the bench , and he does not look at me . He holds a sheaf of bank notes . I can tell by their color that they are of small denomination , by their rumpled condition that they have been hoarded long . People near him are staring  --  horrified , I think  --  at the vulgar spectacle of cash at a Newmarket auction . <p> I am not horrified , nor sympathetic . Suddenly I am aware that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for a purpose that has little to do - with sentiment , and I will not be beaten . I think of my stable in Kenya , of the feed bills to come , of the syces to be paid , of the races that are yet to be won if I am to survive in this unpredictable business . No , I can not now yield an inch . I have little money , but so has he . No more , I think , but perhaps as much . <p> I hesitate a moment and glance at the little man , and he returns my glance . We are like two gamblers bidding each against the other 's unseen cards . Our eyes meet for a sharp instant  --  a cold instant . <p> I straighten and my catalog is crumpled in my hand . I moisten my lips and call , " Three hundred ! " I call it firmly , steadily , hoping to undo my opponent at a stroke . It is a wishful thought . <p> He looks directly at me now , but does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look at one who bears false witness against him , then soundlessly he counts his money and bids again , " Three fifty ! " <p> The interest of the crowd is suddenly aroused . All these people are at once conscious of being witnesses , not only before an auction , but before a contest , a rivalry of wills . They shift in their seats and stare as they might stare at a pair of duelists , rapiers in hand . <p> But money is the weapon , Rigel the prize . And prize enough , I think , as does my adversary . <p> I ponder and think hard , then decide to bid 100 more . Not 20 , not 50 , but 100 . Perhaps by that I can take him in my stride . He need not know that there is little more to follow . He may assume that I am one of the casual ones , impatient of small figures . He may hesitate , he may withdraw . He may be cowed . <p> Still standing , I utter , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty ! " and the auctioneer , at ease in his element of contention , brightens visibly . <p> I am aware that the gathered people are now fascinated by this battle of pounds and shillings over a stallion that not one of them would care to own . I only hope that in the heat of it some third person does not begin to bid . But I need not worry ; Rigel takes care of that . <p> The little jockey has listened to my last offer , and I can see that he is already beaten  --  or almost , at least . He has counted his money a dozen times , but now he counts it again , swiftly , with agile fingers , as if hoping his previous counts had been somehow wrong . <p> I feel a momentary surge of sympathy , then smother it . Horse training is not my hobby . It is my living . I wait for what I am sure will be his last bid , and it comes . For the first time , he rises from his bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the glances of the well-clad people about him lend him nothing . He does not care . His eyes are on the stallion and I can see that there is a kind of passion in them . I have seen that expression before-in the eyes of sailors appraising a comely ship , in the eyes of pilots sweeping the clean , sweet contours of a plane . There is reverence in it , desire  --  and even hope . <p> The little man turns slightly to face the expectant auctioneer , then clears his throat and makes his bid . " Four eighty ! " he calls , and the slight note of desperation in his voice is unmistakable , but I force myself to ignore it . Now , at last , I tell myself , the prize is mine . <p> The auctioneer receives the bid and looks at me , as do a hundred people . Some of them , no doubt , think I am quite mad or wholly inexperienced , but they watch while the words " Five hundred " form upon my lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rigel . Rigel has been ignored . He has stood quietly enough after his first brief effort at freedom : he has scarcely moved . But now , at the climax of the sale , his impatience overflows , his spirit of fire flares like fire , his anger bursts through the circle of men who guard him . Suddenly , there are cries , shouts of warning , the ringing of chains , and the cracking of leather , and the crowd leaps to its feet . Rigel is loose . Rigel has hurled his captors from him and he stands alone . <p> It is a beautiful thing to see , but there is terror in it . A thoroughbred stallion with anger in his eye is not a sight to entrance anyone but a novice . If you are aware of the power and the speed and the intelligence in that towering symmetrical body , you will hold your breath as you watch it . You will know that the teeth of a horse can crush a bone , that hoofs can crush a man . And Rigel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , his neck curved , his golden tail a battle plume , and he turns slowly , deliberately , and faces the men he has flung away . They are not without courage , but they are without resource . Horses are not tamed by whips or by blows . The strength of ten men is not so strong as a single stroke of a hoof ; the experience of ten men is not enough , for this is the unexpected , the unpredictable . No one is prepared . No one is ready . <p> The words " Five hundred " die upon my lips as I watch , as I listen . For the stallion is not voiceless now . His challenging scream is shrill as the cry of winter wind . It is bleak and heartless . His forehoofs stir the tanbark . The auction is forgotten . <p> A man stands before him  --  a man braver most . He holds nothing in his hands save an exercise bat , and it looks a feeble thing , and is . It is a thin stick bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has seen such things in men 's hands before . He knows their meaning . Such a thing as this bat , slight as it is , enrages him because it is a symbol that stands for other things . It stands , perhaps , for the confining walls of a darkened stable , for the bit of steel , foreign but almost ever-present in his mouth , for the tightened girth , the command to gallop , to walk , to stop , to parade before the swelling crowd of gathered people , to accept the measured food gleaned from forbidden fields . It stands for servitude . And Rigel has broken with his overlords . <p> He lunges quickly , and the man with a bat is not so quick . He lifts the pathetic stick and waves it in desperation . He cries out , and the voice of the crowd drowns his cry . Rigel 's neck is outstretched and straight as a saber . There is dust and the shouting of men and the screaming of women , for the stallion 's teeth have closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man struggles and drops his bat , and his eyes are sharp with terror , perhaps with pain . Blood leaves the flesh of his face , and it is a face gray and pleading , as must be the faces of those to whom retribution is unexpected and swift . He beats against the golden head while the excitement of the crowd mounts against the fury of Rigel . Then reason vanishes . Clubs , whips , and chains appear like magic in the ring , and a regiment of men advances upon the stallion . They are angry men , brave in their anger , righteous and justified in it . They advance , and the stallion drops that man he has attacked , and the man runs for cover , clutching his shoulder . <p> I am standing , as is everyone . It is a strange , an unreal thing to see this trapped and frustrated creature , magnificent and alone , away from his kind , remote from the things he understands , face the punishment of his minuscule masters . He is , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he could run , he would leave this place , abandoning his fear and his hatred to it . But he can not run . The walls of the arena are high . The doors are shut , and the trap makes blindness of his anger . He will fight , and the blows will fall with heaviness upon his spirit , for his body is a rock before these petty weapons . <p> The men edge closer , ropes and chains and whips in determined hands . The whips are uplifted , the chains are ready ; the battle line is formed , and Rigel does not retreat . He comes forward , the whites of his eyes exposed and rimmed with carnelian fire , his nostrils crimson . <p> There is a breathless silence and the little jockey slips like a ghost into the ring . His eyes are fixed on the embattled stallion . He begins to run across the tanbark and breaks through the circle of advancing men and does not stop . Someone clutches at his coat , but he breaks loose without turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rigel alone . The men do not follow him . He waves them back . He goes forward , steadily , easily , and happily , without caution , without fear , and Rigel whirls angrily to face him . <p> Rigel stands close to the wall of the arena . He can not retreat . He does not propose to . Now he can focus fury on this insignificant David who has come to meet him , and he does . He lunges at once as only a stallion can  --  swiftly , invincibly , as if escape and freedom can be found only in the destruction of all that is human , all that smells human , and all that humans have made . <p> He lunges and the jockey stops . He does not turn to lift a hand or otherwise move . He stops , he stands , and there is silence everywhere . No one speaks : no one seems to breathe . Only Rigel is in motion . No special hypnotic power emanates from the jockey 's eyes : he has no magic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a swelling sound when the jockey turns . Like a matador of nerveless skill and studied insolence , the jockey turns his back upon Rigel and does not walk away and the stallion pauses . <p> Rigel rears high at the back of the little man , screaming his defiant scream , but he does not strike . His hoofs are close to the jockey 's head , but do not touch him . His teeth are sheathed . He hesitates , trembles , and roars wind from his massive lungs . He shakes his head , his golden mane , and beats the ground . It is frustration  --  but of a new kind . It is a thing he does not know  --  a man who neither cringes in fear nor threatens with whips or with chains . It is a thing beyond his memory perhaps  --  as far beyond it as the understanding of the mare that bore him . <p> Rigel is suddenly motionless , rigid , suspicious . He waits , and the gray-eyed jockey turns to face him . The little man is calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand his words . They are low and they are lost to us  --  an incantation . But the stallion seems to understand at least the spirit , if not the sense of them . He snorts , but does not move . And now the jockey 's hand goes forward to the golden mane  --  neither hurriedly nor with hesitance , but unconcernedly , as if it had rested there a thousand times . And there it stays . <p> There is a murmur from the crowd , then silence . People look at one another and stir in their seats  --  a strange self-consciousness in their stirring , for people are uneasy before the proved worth of their inferiors , unbelieving of the virtue of simplicity . They watch with open mouths as the giant Rigel , the killer Rigel , with no harness save a head collar , follows his Lilliputian master , his new friend , across the ring . <p> All had happened in so little time  --  in moments . The audience begins to stand , to leave . But they pause at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they pause . It is all very well , his gesture says , but business is , after all , business , and Rigel has not been sold . He looks up at me knowing I have a bid to make  --  the last bid . And I look down into the ring at the stallion I have come so far to buy . His head is low and close to the shoulder of the man who would take him from me . He is not prancing now , not moving . For this hour , at least , he is changed . <p> I straighten , and then shake my head . I need only say , " Five hundred , " but the words wo n't come . I ca n't get them out . I am angry with myself-a sentimental fool-and I am disappointed . But I can not bid . It is too easy  --  20 pounds too little , and yet too great an advantage . <p> No . I shake my head again , the auctioneer shrugs and turns to seal his bargain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend jostles me . " You did n't really want him , then , " he says . <p> " Want him ? No . No , I did n't really want him . " <p> " It was wise , " he says . " What good is a horse that 's warned off every course in the Empire ? You would n't want a horse like that . " <p> We move to the exit , and , when we are out in the bright cold air of Newmarket , I turn to my friend and mention the little jockey . " But he wanted Rigel , " I say . <p> And my old friend laughs . " He would , " he says . " That man has himself been barred from racing for 15 years . Why , I ca n't remember . But it 's two of a kind , you see  --  Rigel and Sparrow . Outlaws both . He loves and knows horses as no man does , but that 's what we call him around the tracks  --  the Fallen Sparrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Markham <p>
