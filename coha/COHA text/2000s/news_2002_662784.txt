<p> HUNTSVILLE , Texas - The whispers started following the 1999 season after a senior transfer quarterback named Chris Chaloupka left Oklahoma State and came to Huntsville , where he rewrote the Sam Houston State offensive record book . <p> One year later , senior quarterback Josh McCown left the SMU Mustangs and rode into town . By the time he departed for the National Football League this spring , the Kats were in possession of a Southland Conference championship , a I-AA playoff victory , a No. 7 national ranking and a reputation as one of the best teams in the country for Division I-A transfers . <p> " We had always said at one time we 'd never take a guy with one year ( of eligibility ) , but obviously Chris Chaloupka and Josh McCown were truly impact players , " SHSU coach Ron Randleman said . " You 're not always going to find that , but you ca n't say you 're never going to do something because if a guy can really be an impact player , I think you have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . " <p> That was n't always the scenario at SHSU . Randleman said he did n't favor the one-time transfer rule when it went into effect during the late 1980s . Far too often players transferred for what Randleman called the wrong reasons - poor academics or problems with the law . <p> " Our early experience with transfers were not as positive as our later experiences have been , " Randleman said . " Some of our early transfers were guys who maybe did n't work very hard , and that 's probably why they did n't have success where they were . <p> " It seemed like when the rule first came in , we might get more that did n't work very hard than we did that did work very hard . Of late , I have not seen any appreciable difference between a transfer and a new guy . That tells me some of the guys are transferring for the right reasons , like a better football and better university environment . " <p> The Bearkats have 12 Division I-A transfers who have joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been in Huntsville for at least a year . Senior transfer quarterbacks Luke Huard and Vance Smith said they picked SHSU because of its wide-open offense . It 's the same reason senior wide receiver Bosley Allen and sophomore wide receiver Jason Mathenia have moved the Huntsville . <p> " I knew I had one year left of eligibility and I wanted to find a place that ran the type of system I was looking for , " said Huard , who spent four years at the University of North Carolina . " Obviously Sam Houston fell into that category . It was a pretty easy decision . " <p> When asked during the Southland Conference media day , every head coach in the SLC said they favored the transfer rule . The unanimous opinion was summed up best by Southwest Texas coach Bob DeBesse . <p> " There is tremendous value in being in position to take I-A transfers , provided they fit the program , " DeBesse said . " We 've been in the transfer market not as much as some and we 've done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have at I-AA , and certainly it 's an advantage that , within your own program and your own philosophy , I think you need to take as much advantage of as you can . " <p> For older players , the decision to transfer is often based solely on the opportunity to play . Three SLC quarterbacks were drafted by the NFL this spring the most from any conference in the country and all three were I-A transfers ( McCown , Wes Pate from Stephen F. Austin and Craig Nall from Northwestern State ) . Randleman said the transfer rule has been most beneficial to quarterbacks , and believes SHSU will continue to take advantage of the situation . <p> " Your I-A 's will have more quarterbacks on scholarship so they can sort through and get what they want , " Randleman said . " It just seems like that 's a natural thing for us then . Sometimes someone who did n't quite fit ( at a Division I-A school ) now may realize that it 's not the end of the world and there are other opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young quarterback is thinking about leaving , he 'll consider us . " <p> Wins and losses is another factor in the transfer decision . It was at the heart of McCown ' decision , and influenced Huard as well . <p> " Winning is fun . Losing sucks , " Huard said bluntly . " I wanted to go to a school that was competitive , and the good thing about Sam Houston is everybody here has real high expectations . It 's fun to be a part of that again . " <p> A newer trend among transfers is freshmen who attend a Division I-A school away from their home state and decide after a short stay that home is too far away . More often than not , players look to the I-AA schools that recruited them out of high school . <p> Jason Mathenia , who transferred to SHSU after playing as a true freshman at Vanderbilt , said outside pressure is a big reason many players pick an I-A university over an I-AA out of high school . <p> " A lot of high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents and high school coaches to make them look good , " Mathenia said . " My advice if I had a kid that was getting recruited by Division I-A schools and they wanted to go Division I-AA because they liked the school better , I 'd tell them to go for it . There 's not much difference between them , just the notoriety . " <p> Stephen F. Austin coach Mike Santiago said many young men decided to transfer to an I-AA school because they wo n't lose a year of eligibility a penalty imposed by the NCAA when a player transfers from one Division I-A institution to another . <p> " The transfer rule is good because it gives these guys the ability to make a mistake , which you 're gon na make when you 're 18 years old , and recover from it , " Santiago said . " Losing a year of eligibility is a big penalty for making a mistake . I wish those kids would listen to us during ( high school ) recruiting . <p> " As a guy who has recruited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a player when I 'm sitting in his home . You know what he 's doing , but you know in reality he 's going to be back pretty quick , not because he 's not a good player but because he 's going to miss mamma , " he said . <p> There is a dark side to the transfer rule , and the Bearkats have not been immune . Most recently , Jaron Dabney came to SHSU in 2000 after he was kicked out of Brigham Young University following several run-ins with the law . Injuries hampered the former Sealy High School star that season , and academic problems ended his stay at Sam Houston after one year . <p> " I 'm not afraid to give a young man a second chance that 's had a problem some place , but you 've got to weigh and measure who might be a good risk for a second chance and who might not be , " Randleman said . " You 're not always going to make the right judgments on those things . " <p> Before leaving North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem that led to his dismissal from the Tar Heel football team . <p> Randleman said the key to making a wise decision on a questionable transfer is doing research . <p> " Generally you know someone on the staff where a young man came from that will be honest with you . That 's the best indicator , " Randleman said . " With Bosley , he was well recommended by coaches who knew him . That 's a big difference than if you call a coach you know and he says , ' If I were you , I would n't take that one . ' If they say that , you better listen . " <p> Allen , a starter at North Carolina , said he 's thankful for the chance to prove his critics wrong . <p> " I know I 'm a good person . I just made a few mistakes , " Allen said . " I look forward to the next day . I do n't dwell on the past . I know I made mistakes and I know things have happened in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day . That 's helped me out a lot . " <p> The transfer system is evolving , and Sam Houston State is trying to keep pace . Randleman agreed with his fellow SLC coaches that high school recruiting will always be the foundation of a strong program , but said his staff made a conscious decision to save more scholarships for I-A transfers while decreasing their emphasis on junior college recruiting . <p> " Is it going to be beneficial that we took more transfers this year ? Well , we 're going to have to evaluate that at the end of the season and at the end of next year , " Randleman said . " Thus far , it looks like perhaps we 've helped our program .
