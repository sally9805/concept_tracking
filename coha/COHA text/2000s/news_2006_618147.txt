<p> As head of acquisitions for New York 's Magnolia Pictures , Tom Quinn loves movies and he loves Atlanta . He just wishes the city 's annual film festival lived up to its potential . <p> " I could program a great festival in Siberia as long as you have a place where people can gather together , " says Quinn , who was a guest programmer for the 2005 Atlanta Film Festival . " That 's the long-term goal of any festival . It gives the festival some real identity that people can differentiate from Tribeca and Sundance and other festivals . " <p> In Quinn 's mind , that communal spot did n't really exist at the 2005 fest , which like this year 's had as its focal point downtown 's Rialto Center for the Performing Arts . Other venues were spread from downtown to Midtown and Buckhead . His view of what a communal spot should look like for a fest : Virginia-Highland . <p> The Atlanta Film Festival is now 30 years old , and many believe its problems extend beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event still aching to define itself . <p> Just over a week ago , Image Film &; Video Center , the Atlanta organization that produces the fest , announced the hiring of former Atlantan Gabriel Wardell as executive director . He most recently programmed the Sonoma Valley Film Festival in California and has been involved with the American Film Institute 's Silverdocs documentary festival and other fests . <p> Wardell arrives from California in September and is planning to meet with Image staff , community leaders and arts sponsors to talk about what the festival should be . <p> It wo n't be an easy task . <p> Organizers say the fest 's main mission is to promote independent films , but critics believe it has consistently missed out on marketing opportunities and building a film event that enhances the metro area 's growing international status . <p> Those concerns notwithstanding , Atlanta 's event has boasted successive record crowds in recent years and offered celebrated art films and indie fare  --  such as " Run , Lola , Run , " " March of the Penguins , " " Ulee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's debatable whether the festival is well-recognized in the South , or even in metro Atlanta . <p> Voicing some displeasure <p> This year 's festival ran nine days in June , attracting 27,000 attendees . While there were newspaper stories in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and in other publications about it , little to no signage in metro Atlanta alerted citizens that the event was under way . <p> In 2005 , an overflow crowd turned out for the festival opener , the Atlanta premiere of eventual Oscar winner " Hustle &; Flow , " but some other screenings were sparsely attended . Only 12 people showed up at the 833-seat Rialto for a Saturday morning appearance by Emmy nominee Paul Reiser and a screening of his film , " The Thing About My Folks . " Local representatives for the film 's distributor , Picturehouse , said they had been told by festival organizers to expect a crowd of about 500 . <p> " In the end , about the only thing the festival did right was to start the film on time , " Reiser told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Image 's limited vision for the festival . <p> " I do n't think we should be satisfied with small increases in attendance year to year in a market like Atlanta that 's becoming an international city , " says Joel Babbit , chief creative officer at Grey Worldwide Atlanta , which created the city 's branding tagline " Atlanta : Every day is an opening day . " <p> In contrast to Atlanta 's festival , the South by Southwest music gathering in Austin , Texas , which added films in 1994 , has become a movie-industry magnet . Even the smaller Savannah Film Festival , which will hold its ninth event this fall , has successfully raised its profile , drawing on the appearances of celebrity talent , including Oscar winners and nominees such as Atlanta resident Jane Fonda , Peter O'Toole and Alec Baldwin . <p> Before this year 's fest , Babbit resigned from Image 's advisory board , a panel formed a few years ago to talk about the festival 's future and make suggestions to the agency and its board of directors . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he feels has n't taken full advantage of Atlanta 's entertainment industry and has neglected the advisory board and maintained " a total lack of communication . " <p> As far as staffing has been concerned , Image in recent years has been a revolving door . <p> Brian Newman and Paul Marchant , who served as Image executive director and festival director , respectively , during some of the fest 's most productive years , each left before the 2005 festival for jobs in New York . <p> The 2005 and 2006 seasons then saw wholesale changes in personnel at Image , including the resignations of executive director Alison Fussell and festival director Jake Jacobson . The resignations , roughly a year apart , were mutually agreed upon departures with Jon Aaron , former Image board chairman who 's been leading the arts group during the search for Fussell 's replacement . <p> Jacobson helmed this year 's fest , which attained a record crowd , but he left Image with critical words about its management . He says his goal was to expand the festival , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For his part , Aaron is proud of the festival 's audience gains and optimistic about its future . <p> " I do n't want to knock our success , " Aaron says . " It 's amazing for a city this size we do n't have even a more amazing festival , but I really feel like with the staff we have now running Image all year long ... that we are poised to be an even stronger voice than we have been for the last 30 years . " <p> Seeking an identity <p> This year 's festival made a concerted effort to reconnect with Atlanta filmmakers . Several made-in-Georgia movies  --  Edford Banuel Jr . ' s " The Last Adam , " Gregg Bishop 's " The Other Side , " Lisa France 's " The Unseen " and Bret Wood 's " Psychopathia Sexualis "  --  were given prime screening slots . <p> While those films drew large crowds , some say such turnout can be deceptive , especially if the quality of the film is questionable . <p> " Local filmmakers should be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone knows you were accepted into the festival only because you are local , " former Image chief Newman says . " You can always fill up your seats with the families and friends of local filmmakers , but you have to balance that with your festival 's integrity . " <p> Among Wardell 's first tasks : Begin a search for a director for Atlanta 's fest . <p> " I think Image is poised to really elevate itself , " he says . " With all the talent there , there 's no reason why it should n't make its festival as important as San Francisco and Seattle and Cleveland , something city-based and regional . <p> " It 's not going to be Sundance or Toronto , but that 's OK , " he says . " You find the things intrinsic to your region and to your festival and show them as your strength . " <p> Wardell , 35 , also wants to increase sponsorships and develop marketing . <p> For the past couple of years , Turner Broadcasting has given Image $100,000 annually to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall-season Out on Film , the metro area 's gay , lesbian and transgender film festival . That will continue through 2008 , according to Turner spokeswoman Lisa Tobias . <p> Though no official changes have been planned , Wardell also said he would like to see the Atlanta fest , which for the past few years has been held in June , move to an earlier date . <p> Former board member Babbit is urging Image to think about transforming Atlanta 's event into a Southern film festival . <p> " In a world where there are film festivals for every city in the world , there is n't a Southern film festival of any note , " Babbit says . " If you widen the scope , you could pull funding from throughout the Southeast and not be as limited . It allows Atlanta to be the home of something clearly defined instead of being just another film festival in another city , which is what we are right now . " <p> Magnolia Pictures ' Quinn believes one need only look at an unexpected positive from 2005 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " ' Hustle &; Flow , ' " he says , referring to that year 's opening-night feature . <p> It represented many things to the fest . A distinctly Southern film made in Memphis and starring eventual Oscar nominee Terrence Howard and Atlanta Grammy winner Chris " Ludacris " Bridges . A sold-out Rialto . A palpable buzz among the diverse audience , both in race and age . <p> " When the various neighborhoods come together in Atlanta , it becomes exciting , it becomes something new , " Quinn says . " That 's something Atlanta can do very well . <p> " That 's something it can do better than Los Angeles . "
