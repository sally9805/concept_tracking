AN OLD ROCKER ROLLS AGAIN FOR SEPT. 11 <P> Radio stations across the country got a little surprise in the mail last week : just-burned plain white compact discs on which were scrawled , Let 's Roll and NEIL YOUNG . Yes , the Neil Young , muttonchopped crooner of protest hymns , who , while recording his new album , asked his manager to roll out Roll , his ode to the hijacked passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 . Young was inspired by reading an article about Todd Beamer , 32 , who stormed the cockpit  --  but not before signaling his fellow rebels with his now famous phrase , " Let 's roll . " The song is " a powerful funk-rock dirge , " according to the New York Times . It has been getting much radio play and will be included in Young 's new album next spring . But why the low-key marketing campaign ? Said a rep from Young 's record label : " This was n't designed to compete with Britney and Shakira . " <P> Love And Cartburn <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilt ) , something was new ( the bride 's white Giorgio Armani empire-waist dress ) ; something was borrowed ( Skibo , the Scottish castle where Madonna wed ) , and something was ... burning ! Actress ASHLEY JUDD ( below , at this year 's Oscar ceremony ) , 33 , and Edinburgh-born race-car driver DARIO FRANCHITTI , 28 , were reportedly 10 minutes into their wedding ceremony when a golf cart used to ferry guests around caught fire . The brief blaze was not the only excitement . Rumors of DeNiro , Paltrow , Douglas and Zeta-Jones cameos proved false , but other Judds sang Love Can Build a Bridge . Inside , fires blazed in their proper places , and the marriage bed was strewn with specially airlifted-in red rose petals  --  and extra tartan blankies . <P> BRILLIANT CAREER , INTERRUPTED <P> Last year two-time Oscar nominee WINONA RYDER told a reporter , " Trends are so fleeting that new clothes are a bad investment . " This may help explain the inexplicable : why the Reality Bites star was charged by the Beverly Hills police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saks Fifth Avenue security staff captured her on video removing security sensors from clothes , jewelry and hair accessories , putting the goods into a large bag and leaving the store . Total haul : about $4,700 . But it got more complicated for Ryder , 30 , when police found pharmaceutical drugs in her bag  --  but no prescription . She was released on $20,000 bond and drove home in her black Mercedes . Her lawyer , Mark Geragos , says it 's " a misunderstanding on the part of the store " and that Ryder can produce receipts . But can she produce a lift in her career ? Her recent movies , such as Autumn in New York , have been box-office duds . Ryder has always been considered smart , edgy and a tad fragile . While promoting the psych-ward memoir Girl , Interrupted , she told reporters she 'd once checked herself into a psych ward , and checked herself out two weeks later . Her next appearance : a Jan. 11 court date . <P> YOU HAVE TO FIGHT TO GAIN NIRVANA    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
