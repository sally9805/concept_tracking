<p> What difference does a gigahertz make ? <p> Over the past couple of weeks , I 've had a chance to find out for myself . I 've been testing three new PCs with processors that run at gigahertz speeds  --  1,000 megahertz , or 1 billion clock cycles per second . ( By way of context , a gigahertz is 200 times the speed of the original 1981 IBM PC , and twice the speed of the fastest PC chip available just 14 months ago . ) <p> One of these machines , the Pavilion 1G from Hewlett-Packard , has Intel 's gigahertz Pentium III ; the other two , the Poly 800K7-1000 from Polywell Computers Inc. of South San Francisco , and the Gateway Select 1000 Deluxe from Gateway , have the gigahertz version of Advanced Micro Devices ' Athlon chip . <p> As an unabashed speed freak from way back  --  when it comes to computers , that is  --  I got a kick out of breaking the gigahertz barrier , but the thrill was mostly intellectual ; I ca n't honestly claim the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you put two comparably configured PCs on my desk , one with a gigahertz chip and the other with a processor running at , say , 500 or 600 megahertz , I 'm not even sure I could tell which is which , at least with the applications I use most of the time  --  e-mail , Web browsing , word processing , modest databases and spreadsheets . Even if your software repertoire is more diverse than mine  --  maybe you dabble in digital photography , or your kids are into M music  --  my guess is that you 'd have to look hard to notice the difference . <p> The plain truth is that for the majority of PC users , both at home and at work , processor speed has ceased to be a major issue . Nowadays , the most important bottleneck for most of us ( not counting our own typing and thinking speeds ) is our Internet connection ; secondarily , many users suffer poor performance simply because their systems have insufficient RAM or second-rate hard drives . <p> That was already the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 500 megahertz ; it 's all the more true now that those speeds have doubled . <p> Not for everyone , though . Significant numbers of PC users  --  scientists and engineers , professional programmers , graphic artists , video editors and others  --  are still held back by the limits of their PCs ' processors . If you 're in one of those categories , more megahertz still translate directly into time saved  --  not just seconds , but minutes , maybe even hours over the course of a workweek . And for hard-core gamers a faster processor , paired with a state-of-the-art 3-D card , means richer , more lifelike graphics . <p> For the rest of us , there 's still real value in high-end PCs like those I tested , but it has less to do with their souped-up CPUs than with the other components PC-makers typically pack into their top-of-the-line models : mountains of memory , ultrafast hard drives with acres of storage space , the latest in graphics technology and assorted other goodies . But if you shop carefully , you can get all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips command . Some specifics about what does and does n't change with a gigahertz PC : <p>  --  Booting up still takes forever  --  between a minute and a minute and a half for each of these machines . <p>  --  Gigahertz PCs are no more stable and reliable than their predecessors . Application crashes may be less frequent  --  I did n't run into any  --  because these systems have lots of memory , but Windows froze up several times as I was shutting down . <p> Worse , the Gateway machine went south halfway through my testing  --  it seemed to boot up normally , but the screen went blank shortly after the Windows 98 splash screen went by . Same thing happened when I tried to boot in Windows ' " safe mode , " and even removing and reinstalling the video card did n't help . After futzing with the system for more than an hour , I gave up  --  a PC with a blank screen is n't much use no matter how fast its processor . Adding hardware is as much an adventure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these will probably end up connected either to a local-area network or to a high-speed cable or DSL hookup , only the HP Pavilion comes with an Ethernet card as standard equipment . Adding a Kingston network card to the Gateway was no problem . But I went through hell trying to add the same card to the Polywell box . <p> In short , even at a gigahertz , Windows plug-and-play continues to deserve its " plug-and-pray " nickname . <p>  --  Your Internet connection does n't get any faster . A high-powered processor , together with an ultrafast video card ( all three of these machines came with today 's hottest graphics chip , the Nvidia GeForce 256 , and 32 megabytes of video RAM ) , does speed up the rendering of complex Web pages . But the fundamental constraint on surfing speed is still bandwidth  --  the speed of your connection to the Internet  --  and the processor does n't change that . <p> If you already have a reasonably up-to-date PC  --  one with a processor running at , say , 300 megahertz or more  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web faster , you 're better off investing in a cable or DSL connection than spending your money on a faster CPU . <p>  --  You ca n't get very far ahead of the obsolescence curve . Even though they 're on the bleeding edge of technology today , these chips will be passe in a few months . This summer , AMD is expected to ship a whole new version of the Athlon , code-named Thunderbird and reportedly to be branded the Athlon Ultra . It will probably run at appreciably higher speeds , and , even more important , it will have extra performance-enhancing memory ( the " Level 2 cache " ) built right on the chip , as is already the case with Intel 's processors . The current Athlon , like older Intel versions , relies on separate chips for its Level 2 cache , which limits the effectiveness of this important technique . <p> Intel plans to add a new generation , code-named Willamette , to its Pentium line this fall . The new chips are likely to run at significantly higher clock speeds ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version ) and incorporate other performance improvements . <p> Personally , I 'm waiting for Willamette before I get a new PC . <p> On the other side of the ledger , today 's gigahertz chips are really and truly a lot faster than any PC processor produced more than a few months ago . I ran a battery of benchmark tests on the three gigahertz models and on my regular home PC , a 21-month-old , 400-megahertz Pentium II machine . <p> The results were pretty dramatic . On Ziff-Davis ' WinStone tests , which attempt to measure overall performance in top-selling real-life applications , the new machines scored about 75 percent above my old clunker . On ZD 's WinBench CPUmark 99 , which focuses specifically on processing speed , I got a score of 31.4 on my old machine , just shy of 80 on the two gigahertz Athlon models and 85.7 on the Intel-based HP Pavilion . <p> Whether changes even of this magnitude make any real difference for most users in most applications is debatable . I certainly did n't produce this article any faster because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In demanding applications and games , however , the speedup is quite noticeable . <p> In id Software 's Quake II , for instance , using id 's OpenGL display driver , I got 60 frames per second ( fps ) on my old PC ; on the gigahertz machines that figure jumped to about 125 fps , which translates into noticeably smoother , more realistic graphics . <p> I also ran a series of tests with Adobe Photoshop  --  not just because it 's a critical application for most graphics professionals , but also because it 's a pretty good indicator of performance in other programs that push PCs to their limits . <p> Here , too , the benefits of the fast processors were clear cut , at least on many operations . Applying a Gaussian blur filter to my 50-megabyte test image , for example , took 51.5 seconds on my 400-megahertz PC , but only 17.5 seconds on the HP Pavilion and a mere 4.1 seconds on the Polywell system . A sequence of seven processor-intensive operations took 323 seconds on my old PC , 185 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't able to run these tests on the Gateway because of the blank-screen problem noted earlier . ) <p> These Photoshop results seem to suggest that the Athlon is significantly faster than the Pentium III at the same clock speed . <p> Do n't be fooled , though : Photoshop always runs faster when it has more memory , and I 'm certain the reason it worked so much better on the Polywell is that that machine came with 256 megabytes of memory , while the Intel-based Pavilion , like my old PC , had a mere 128 megabytes of RAM . <p> Moral of that story : Whatever processor you use , make sure your system is optimally configured for the work you do . If not , much of the horsepower you , or your boss , has invested in could be going to waste . <p> Unfortunately , I was n't able to test the machines with comparable configurations  --  I did n't have extra memory to add to the Pavilion , and I 'd already returned the Polywell by the time the HP system arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests , I suspect , judging by the results of my other benchmarks , that the scores would have been close . Each company points to various technical advantages in its chip , and overall Intels might have a slight edge in performance , but for most purposes the two seem to perform about equally well in equivalent systems . <p> But there is one powerful argument in favor of the Athlon : You can actually order one today and get it within a week or two . Intel seems to have announced its gigahertz entry mainly in an effort to steal AMD 's thunder , and PCs incorporating the chip are all but impossible to buy , as best I can determine . <p> One final word of advice : If you intend to buy a gigahertz PC , consider ordering some earplugs or headphones along with the new system . The new machines are not only the fastest PCs I 've ever used , but also among the noisiest . <p> GIGAHERTZ PCS AT A GLANCE <p> Gateway Select 1000 <p> Processor : 1-gigahertz AMD Athlon <p> RAM : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rpm ) <p> Other drive(s) : DVD-ROM ; floppy <p> Graphics : NVidia GeForce 256 , 32 megabytes video RAM , TV out in 2x AGP slot <p> Communications : 56-K modem <p> OS : Windows 98 <p> Limited warranty : 3 years parts and labor ; one year on-site service Price : $2,579 ( $2,899 with 19-inch color monitor ) <p> Hewlett-Packard Pavilion 1G <p> Processor : 1-gighertz Intel Pentium III <p> RAM : 128 megabytes <p> Hard drive : 40 gigabytes ( 7,200 rpm ) <p> Other drive(s) : DVD-ROM ; CD-RW ; floppy <p> Graphics : NVidia GeForce and 32 megabytes of video RAM in 4x AGP slot Communications : 56-K modem and 10/100 Ethernet card <p> OS : Windows 98 <p> Limited warranty : One year on parts and labor <p> Price : $3,499 <p> Polywell Poly 800K7-1000 <p> Processor : One-gigahertz AMD Athlon <p> RAM : 256 megabytes <p> Hard drives : two 20-gigabytes drives with Promise FastTrak66 RAID controller <p> Other drive(s) : DVD-ROM ; Iomega Zip ( 100 megabytes ) ; floppy <p> Graphics : NVidia GeForce and 32 megabytes of video RAM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Windows 98 ( Windows 2000 , Windows NT , SCO Unix , Sun Solaris and Linux available on request ) <p> Limited warranty : 5 years on labor , 3 years on parts <p> Price : $2,999 <p> . <p> Chronicle Graphic <p> E-mail Henry Norr at hnorr@sfgate.com.
