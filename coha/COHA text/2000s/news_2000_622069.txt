<p> LiveFire has all the right elements for success . The interior is pretty , the chef-owner is well-known , and the greatest-hits menu has just enough twists along the way to keep things interesting . With a prime location in South Beach near the Pacific Bell Park , its popularity seems assured . <p> It does n't take long , however , to discover that LiveFire never catches fire . The restaurant seems to lack a clear vision . Plate presentations range from classic French to down-home American . Some dishes are delicious , others are downright dreadful . As for service , at times a parade of waiters will carry the main courses to the table in the grand Continental tradition , while at other times you 'd be hard-pressed to find anyone to fill a water glass . <p> All this is under the not-so-watchful eye of Fred Halpert , the chef-owner , who also owns Brava Terrace and LiveFire in the Napa Valley and Brazio in Danville . <p> Prices are high for what diners get . Appetizers range from $7.50 to $12.95 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend called to complain about the $8.95 price for mussels doused in a curry mango broth . She did n't much care for the flavor , but she was incredulous at the quantity : eight mussels . There was so much inconsistency at LiveFire , I figured that the kitchen had made a mistake , but on the next visit I found out it had n't . In our case there were only seven because the eighth one had n't opened enough . <p> And that 's not the most outrageous price . For $12.50 diners get three lemongrass poached prawns in a martini glass with a cocktail sauce . On our visit two were pretty good-size and the third was puny ; the flavor was ordinary . The butter pear and bib lettuce salad ( $8.25 ) consisted of seven leaves , four cubes of pears , one cherry tomato , a quarter of a radish , three toasted slivers of almond and dottings of goat cheese . It tasted as pared down as it looked . <p> We actually rejoiced that there were only four 3-inch sections of baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrawny ribs looked ridiculous on the oversize , smudged plate . Along one side someone had attempted to dust a line of paprika for decoration , but it looked sloppy . Why would anyone want a nouvelle presentation for such a down-home recipe anyway ? The ribs were so dry and cold they reminded me of an appetizer that had been set out for a cocktail party at 7 but that no one got around to eating until the midnight cleanup . <p> When we finally got the waiter 's attention , we asked if they were supposed to be hot . He indicated they were , and when he found out ours were cold he said he would " take care of it . " <p> Maybe his way of taking care of it was to get rid of us as quickly as possible . He brought the check , which included the price of the ribs , before we had even finished dessert . When the same thing happened with the check on another visit , I chalked his behavior up to inexperience and lack of training . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are faced with untrained staff , and prices are continuing to rise all over town . What distinguishes LiveFire is that at every turn the restaurant shows no generosity of spirit . When the bread comes to the table it 's one slice per person ; if diners want more they have to ask . <p> Once when we requested water the waiter replied , " Would you like Pellegrino or Evian ? " I retorted , " I know you did n't give it as an option , but I 'll have tap . " It became clear that LiveFire is all about check average and little about hospitality . Good restaurants deliver both . <p> On the first visit we could n't find much to recommend about any of the nine dishes we ordered : Steaks were cold , pasta was stiff and starchy , lettuce went limp and baked goods tasted two days old . Halpert was suited up in kitchen whites but spent most of the night in the dining room seemingly oblivious to the problems in the kitchen . <p> My expectations were low on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Halpert was in the kitchen when we arrived . I could quibble about the doughy pizzetta with potatoes , pecorino and white truffle oil ( $8.95 ) and the desserts ( all $7 ) , but after the first experience it was like comparing Gary Danko to a Daly City diner . The halibut cheeks , a nightly special ( $14.95 ) , were fresh and exciting served on a mound of celery root puree and a bright dotting of fava beans . The roast chicken ( $14.95 ) was a little dry , but the garlic jus helped to intensify the flavor . <p> By the third visit we did n't know what to expect . We ended up enjoying great conversation in the lively 120-seat dining room while being served a roller-coaster array of dishes . The evening 's peak : a very good baby spinach salad with bits of portobello , bacon , mushrooms , roasted garlic and a light walnut oil vinaigrette ( $8.50 ) . The low : the ghastly spring roll that tasted like a commercial egg-roll wrapper filled with slow-cooked duck that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dank flavor . <p> Main courses all were good , if one discounted the accompaniments : The marinated pork chop ( $17.95 ) was juicy with picture-perfect grill marks , but the barley with carrots underneath it was undercooked and had a one-dimensional sauce with a faint citrus flavor . The short ribs ( $16.95 ) tasted like a classic Midwestern pot roast and were falling-off-the-bone tender . After one bite we pushed aside the heavy herb dumpling and concentrated on the meat . One of the best entrees was the poached salmon ( $17.50 ) topped with a fine julienne of carrots , zucchini and other vegetables . The ponzu glaze flavored what tasted like a well-made butter sauce that brought all the elements together . If diners do n't mind struggling with a whole crab they 'll like the version here ( $25 ) with cubes of tofu , scallions and a light oyster sauce with mirin . Unfortunately , the kitchen does n't crack the shells properly . <p> Desserts ( all $7 ) , which had been uneven earlier , were better on the last visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse texture , and the profiteroles with caramel ice cream were much too leathery . The streusel crisp with macadamia nut brittle ice cream showcased mango in its best light . Probably the best dessert , which was on the menu on all three visits , was the strawberry float with layers of berries , strawberry frappe and a mild ( thank goodness ) orange-basil sherbet . <p> Still , even if all the desserts were marvelous , it is n't enough to carry the restaurant . Clearly the best thing about LiveFire is the decor , which is highlighted by expansive windows overlooking the Embarcadero and the bay beyond . The dark-and-light striped wood floors set a casual yet elegant tone , accented with a zinc bar and counter , white tile walls and comfortable banquettes arranged around the open kitchen . An impressive lattice-topped table that seats at least 12 dominates another , more formal-looking room . <p> However , the warmth of the interior is negated by the sloppy service and inconsistent food . There are glimmers of something better in each , but it 's a fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although the wine list at LiveFire is a little more expensive than what 's found at most restaurants , it has some interesting choices , along with some great prices for those who know how to choose . <p> Wines are cleverly arranged by varietal , and each category has wines from around the world . It 's great for those who often overlook the imports and go for the easier-to-understand California options . <p> The most interesting selection is among the red wines , where the 1997 Tablas Creek Rhone Cuvee ( $50 ) stands out . Produced near Paso Robles , the wine is the first California release of Chateau de Beaucastel , one of France 's premium Chateauneuf du Pape producers . Connoisseurs will be wowed by the 1996 Chateau St. Jean Cinq Cepages , the Sonoma blend that topped Wine Spectator 's most recent top 100 list . <p> Markups are all over the board . The 1997 Newton Special Cuvee Unfiltered Merlot is a steal at $39 ; it wholesales at about $30 . On the other extreme , the 1997 La Vieille Ferme Cotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In white wine , the 1998 Brancott Reserve Sauvignon Blanc ( $31 ) from New Zealand is a great option to go with the seafood platter , and the 1997 Hugel Cuvee Les Amours Pinot Blanc ( $30 ) is good with about anything . <p> The list also features 20 interesting wines by the glass and some excellent after-dinner drinks . There 's a nice option to have one-ounce samplers of three sweet wines . The option is also available for Port , Madeira and Sherry . <p> The list is rounded out with a good selection of grappa , Scotch , specialty cocktails and beer . There 's even a Hardcore Apple Cider . <p> Corkage is $10 a bottle . <p>  --  Michael Bauer <p> CHART : <p> LIVEFIRE ADDRESS : 100 Brannan St. ( at Embarcadero ) , San Francisco PHONE : ( 415 ) 227-0777 HOURS : Lunch 11:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m .
