His last address was his own body , and what a squalid place it was . Someone told me he cleaned up just before he died , and I now know it 's true . But when I last saw him , the place was a mess . He was sprawled on a bus bench , stinking of alcohol and urine , drooling in his sleep . He was an African American man , and while it was hard to guess his age , I judged him to be in his fifties . His skin was chapped and one of his cheeks was scraped and swollen , as if he had been in a fight . I took more than a passing interest in him : noted his matted hair , his rough beard , his rumbling snores , the small brown paper sack clutched to his chest like a prayerbook . The last prayer had been prayed out of it sometime ago , judgingby the uncapped screwtop bottleneck . I stood to one side of the bench , studying him , thinking up clever phrases to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation in Las Piernas smile at my description of my predicament , smile over coffee and cereal as they turned the pages of the Express at their breakfast tables . I would be ruthless to the Las Piernas Rapid Transit District - perhaps call it the Rabid Transient District . My small way of repaying it for forcing me to be two hours late getting back to the paper . I had been on buses all day . My back ached and my feet hurt , and one more ride would take me back to the Express . I was tired and frustrated . I felt a righteous anger on behalf of the citizens who had to use the system every day . I had yet to see a bus pull up at the time it was scheduled to make a stop . I could see exactly why the regular riders were angry . This was one day 's story for me ; for them it would mean being late to work , to doctors ' appointments , to classes , to job interviews . One missed connection led to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see-it-for-myself test ride into six hours of hell on wheels . My series of rides had taken me all over the city , and the man before me now was not the first drunk I had encountered , not even the first sleeping drunk . Perhaps the guilt I 've felt since that day now colors my memory of my attitude at the time . There is , in any job that requires a person to observe other people and publish the observations , an aspect of being ... well , a user . I used the man on the bench . Took notes on him . He awoke suddenly , and I took a step back . Awake , he was a little more fearsome . He looked bigger . Stronger . He yawned , wiped a dirty sleeve across his face , and moved to a slumped sitting position . When he noticed me , he cowered away , tucking the bottle closer , eyeing me warily . He was afraid of me . That startled me more than his abrupt awakening . I looked at the swollen cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , and stuffed my pen and notebook into the back pocket of my worn jeans . ( No , I was n't wearing high heels and a tight skirt . A day on buses . I do have a little sense left , even if I am still working for the Express . ) He just studied me , as if trying to fit me into the scheme of things , as if I were someone familiar and yet unfamiliar to him . His eyes were red and he blinked slowly and nodded forward a little , not past the danger of passing out again . After a time , I wished he would pass out . The relentless stare began to unnerve me . I stepped a little farther away , balanced my stance , looked for potential witnesses to whatever harm he might intend . No one . This stop was along a chain-link fence surrounding an old abandoned hotel . No cars in the parking lot . Windows broken . Redevelopment , almost . A few blocks down the way , Las Piernas could show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this end of the street , there were no polished glass skyscrapers , no new theaters or trendy nightspots . Just empty lots and crumbling brick buildings . Weeds pushing up through the neglected asphalt , curbs and sidewalks cracked . The sporadic traffic along the street moved quickly , as if the drivers wanted to get their passage along this blighted block over and done with . I watched longingly for the bus . No sign of it . " I know you , " he said , one careful word at a time . I looked back at him . " I know you , " he repeated . Some teeth missing . Knocked out or lost to decay ? " My picture sometimes runs in the paper , " I said . " I 'm a reporter . " He shook his head . " No . " " Yes , really , " I said , taking another step back . " I 'm a reporter for the Express . " Shook his head again . Kept studying me . Where the hell was that bus ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denim jacket . I was mapping out the safest place to run to when he reached down beneath several layers of T-shirts and pulled out something truly amazing : a large , gold school ring with a red stone in it , dangling from a long metal chain . He held it out toward me , swinging it back and forth like a hypnotist 's watch , and beckoned to me . " Look at it , " he said . " I see , " I said , in the tone one might use in speaking to a child holding a jar full of wasps . I was n't going to venture close enough to see which school the ring came from . He looked up at me again and his eyes were misty . He turned away , curled his shoulders inward , as if afraid I might hit him after all . " I 'm sorry , " I said , feeling as if I had hit him . He shook his head , still keeping his back to me . Where the hell was that bus ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look was pleading . " You do n't remember me . I 'm ... I 'm ... " He ducked his head . " Not who I used to be , " he mumbled . I did n't say anything for a moment . " I 'm not who I used to be , either , " I said , ashamed . " It 's okay , " he said in a consoling tone . " It 's okay . Okay . Okay . " I did n't say anything . " You did n't change , " he said . " I know you . " He winked at me and pointed at my face . " Kelly . " It only took me aback for a moment . " Yes , I 'm Irene Kelly . " He grinned his misshapen grin . " I told you ! " " Yes , well , that 's what I was saying before . You 've probably seen my picture near one of my columns in the paper . " He shook his head and batted a hand in dismissal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me . " Uh-oh , I thought , here it comes . " I do n't even have fare money , " I said , holding up the transfer that would take me back to the parking lot at the paper . And my beloved Karmann Ghia . My nice , safe , private transportation . I looked up the street , and to my delight , one of Las Piernas 's diesel-belching buses was in sight . " No , no , " he insisted , standing up . " I do n't want your money . " Yeah , right , I thought , moving to put the bench between us . " That 's good . Well , nice talking to you . Here 's my bus . " He glanced toward the bus , which was trundling slowly up to the stop . It passed us and stopped just beyond where we stood . I moved toward the forward door . " No , do n't go ! You 're good at math . " I paused at the open door , staring back at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " You 're good at math ! " the man called again , as if it were a password between us , one that would cause me to embrace him as a compatriot . " You gettin ' on this bus , lady ? " the driver asked . I nodded and started to step aboard . " No ! " the man cried , stumbling toward me . I rushed up the steps , shoving my transfer at the driver , dismayed to find the bus so full that I could not retreat back into it . The man drew closer . " Not today , Professor , " the driver said , snapping the door shut in his face . But the " Professor " was n't giving up so easily . He pounded his fists on the glass , staring at me . " You 're good at math ! " he shouted . " You 're good at math ! " The driver pulled away . For a moment , my fear of the man turned into fear for him . But peering into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then turn away in defeat . " The Prof did n't scare you , did he ? " the driver asked . When I did n't reply , he said , " I have n't ever seen him like that . Usually he 's real easygoing , even when he 's drunk . I 've never known the Professor to hurt anybody . " " Why do you call him that ? Was he a professor ? " " Oh , I do n't think so . But he gives little informal tours to the passengers when he gets on the bus . If he cleans up a little , people enjoy it . Do n't let it out to my supervisor , but I sort of let the Prof ride around with me , you know , stay warm when it gets chilly out . Naw , he 's no professor . Just a bum . But he knows all about this area . Grew up in the neighborhood , back when it was one . You ask him about any building on this street , and he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for , how many people lived in it , all kinds of stuff like that . I think it 's the only part of his brain that still works . Remembers old buildings . " Remembers old faces , I thought . By then , the Professor seemed vaguely familiar to me . Why ? I could n't have told you then . But he was right : I 'm good at math . I just had n't yet put two and two together Continues ...
