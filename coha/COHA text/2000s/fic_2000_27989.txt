SATURDAY NIGHT Tamara dried the last crystal wineglass , held it up to the fading summer light shining through the kitchen window , and nodded . Spotless . She hated spots on glasses , particularly crystal . Tomorrow night , when Warren came home from his conference in Cleveland , they 'd share a bottle of Chteau Latour Blanche on their sixth anniversary . Tamara was not a wine connoisseur , but he 'd assured her the Latour Blanche was expensive and should be properly appreciated . When she 'd fussed about spending a lot of money on a bottle of wine , he said it was a gift from a patient . Tamara knew better than to ask which one . Warren was a psychologist and never discussed his patients . Tamara looked , around the pristine kitchen . The whole house was spotless . With no children and no job , she had more than enough time to keep the house perfect , Tonight , however , she had nothing left to clean . She 'd even reorganized the kitchen cabinets and put down fresh shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lovely one with the hummingbird design she 'd created , but she was n't in the mood . She could drop by the headquarters of the suicide hotline Warren had forced her to organize , but tonight she did n't want to hear any sad stories . She did n't enjoy Saturday night television and she felt too restless to read . Usually she took an evening walk , but a storm was predicted . Tamara looked out the window and sighed . Daylight Saving Time extended light until nine o'clock . So far it was a lovely evening , a bit cloudier than usual , but still nice . Surely thestorm would n't hit for over an hour . That left plenty of time for a walk . She grabbed an old white sweater off the coat tree beside the back door . It was mid-June , but Port Ariel , Ohio , sat on the edge of Lake Erie , which sent cool breezes off its water all year . The comfortable temperature was what drew so many tourists to the beach area every summer . Warren hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and rarely had contact with them . Besides , they were good for local business and therefore good for her twin sister Lily , who owned a successful antique store downtown . Tamara was making the hummingbird quilt for Lily 's shop . " People like old furniture but not old bedding . Only bedding , that looks old , " Lily always said . " I could sell three times the number of these gorgeous quilts you make ! " Tamara was pleased by their popularity , but she never increased her production . Haste made for sloppy work . As she automatically locked the back door and descended the perch steps , Tamara glanced at her watch . Eight-thirty . Warren always called promptly at ten when he was out of town . She frowned . She must n't be late for the call . Things were rocky between them . Warren had been irritable , quiet , and aloof for months . Tamara felt he was disappointed that she had n't been able to give him a child , although he never mentioned it . Lily contended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamara told her sister she was being ridiculous . To be twins , they were so different , hardly like sisters at all except for their looks and their love for each other . Lily was n't even religious in spite of their strict Catholic upbringing . Ignoring Lily 's good-natured skepticism , Tamara had begun attending mass every day , praying for the child that would draw Warren back to her . Now she knew her prayers had worked . Her periods were always irregular , but this time she was over a month late . She 'd taken a home pregnancy test this morning and she had wonderful news for Warren , which she 'd save until tomorrow evening when he returned . Humming beneath her breath , Tamara , crossed the lawn and walked down Hyacinth Lane , a wide dirt mad running north through a wooded area . She delighted in the towering oaks , locust trees , and scattered dogwoods and crab apples . When-the dogwoods and crab apples were in bloom , this place seemed like a fairy world . She took a rubber hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond hair in a ponytail . Delicate silver filigree earrings set with amethyst stones swayed in the breeze , tickling her neck . She tilted back her head , closed her eyes , and drew a deep breath . Clean , clear air tinged with the scent of approaching rain and the water of Lake Erie filled her delicate nostrils . When she was young , she and Lily had spent countless hours on the lake in their parents ' cabin cruiser and their sleek twenty-foot inboard motorboat . The girls were excellent water-skiers . Warren went out with the family sometimes on the cabin cruiser , but he always stayed on board . He did n't even fish . Something rustled in , the underbrush . Naturally timid , Tamara grew motionless , her gaze scanning the sides of the road . She knew the sound probably came from a small animal . Most of them were perfectly harmless except for poisonous snakes , although there were n't many of those around . Besides , a snake would n't make so much noise and it certainly would n't attack unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . She felt cold , imagining a sleek head rising up to bury venom-filled fangs in the skin of her ankle . The rustling grew louder . Tamara stiffened . She was ready to turn and dash for home when a large dog burst from the greenery on her left . It bounded to her , panting . " Well , hello there ! " Tamara exclaimed , laughing in relief . This was the fourth evening in a row she 'd seen the dog on her walk . It had wiry black-and-tan hair , mostly black , and seemed to wear a perpetual smile . She called it " Happy Face . " Showing no fear of humans , the dog approached her on slender tan legs-with , white paws , its curled tail wagging . Tamara bent to pet it . She had no idea what breed it was , but she thought it would be beautiful if it were bathed . Instead its hair was matted and slightly oily . It wore no collar , and a fresh scratch ran down the right side of its tan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to have the dog , but Warren had firmly pronounced they could not take it in . He did n't like animals . The dog was so endearing , but it was getting thinner . She decided to buy dog food tomorrow . At least she could keep the dog well fed even if she could n't give it a home . Happy Face walked beside her for , a while , glancing up as if for approval . Wild violets grew along the edges of Hyacinth Lane . Tamara stooped and picked a few while the dog waited patiently , A slate-gray catbird emitted its lonely mewing call to the evening . A few ambitious fireflies were already hard at work , blinking gaudily against the darkening sky . Tamara looked at her watch again . 8:45 . She should return home . She could be bathed and ready for bed by the time Warren called . She smiled . When she was ready for bed , Lily would be ready for a night at trendy Panache . Their old friend Natalie St. John was back in town and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd invited Tamara along , but Tamara declined , telling her she would be waiting for Warren 's call . " You 're hopeless , " Lily had teased . " I might get married some day but I 'll never be as settled as you . Hovering around the phone at ten for a husband ? " Apparently Lily thought hovering only justified in cases of handsome , unpredictable boyfriends . The dog looked up at her expectantly . She 'd forgotten their game . " Okay , Happy Face . " Tamara bent and picked up a stick . The dog shifted from paw to paw in anticipation . Tamara threw the stick far into the trees . The dog shot after it . Usually it returned in less than a minute with the stick , which it dropped at her feet . This time Tamara heard it barking . The barking grew fainter . Obviously it had spotted a rabbit and was giving chase . At least she hoped it was a rabbit . She did n't want to be greeted by a dog reeking of skunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up ahead reared the remains of Saunders House built back in the early-nineteenth century when Port Ariel was called Winthrop . When the senior Saunderses died , their beautiful daughter Ariel became the lover of Captain Zebediah Winthrop , whose father had founded the town . Ariel was labeled a " scarlet woman " after she gave birth to Zebediah 's son Thaddeus out of wedlock ; In his youth Zebediah had been forced to marry a homely crab of a woman inaptly named Mercy . While Zebediah sailed Lake Erie , Mercy and her pious friends delighted in wreaking petty vengeances on Ariel and the baby , terrorizing the young mother . Then , when Thaddeus was barely one year old , Captain Winthrop 's ship , the Mercy , caught fire and , foundered on the shore near Ariel ' s house . Ariel had spotted the wreck from her widow 's walk and rushed to the rescue , single-handedly saving two injured sailors and her beloved Zeb from drowning . Mercy died shortly afterward , mostly from bitterness and jealousy and pure meanness , people claimed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most citizens had forgiven her in light of her bravery and did not object when Zebediah changed the name of the town in her honor . Together they had two more children . Zeb died long before Ariel and she had a large monument built to him in the town square . Although she lived to be eighty , she never remarried . As children Tamara and Lily were entranced by the story of Ariel who had lived alone on the windy shore of Lake Erie , tormented yet strong and loving . They thought she was beautiful , wonderful , courageous , and all that a woman should be . Unbeknownst to their parents , they used to dress up and play for hours in the Saunders house , taking turns at pretending to be Ariel . Sometimes Natalie St. John played with them . Tamara had seen pictures of Ariel and thought that with her long black hair and dark eyes , Natalie made the best Ariel , but she never told Lily . Natalie was the only one of their friends with whom they shared the secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . For just a moment Tamara had an impulse to forge ahead and take a look at the decrepit house . Then she glanced up . Dark clouds billowed . The summer storm was blowing in faster than she 'd expected . She had no time for exploring now . She 'd left several of her windows up and her new car in the driveway beneath a tree instead of in the garage . Tamara turned and took several hurried steps down Hyacinth Lane . Tree limbs swayed and creaked . A silvery shaft of lightning tipped the gray sky . Tamara 's ponytail blew wildly in the wind and a piece of , dirt flew into her right eye . She stopped , rubbing at it gently . Damn . It had lodged under a contact lens . A tear ran down her cheek . Lord , it hurt . She shut her eye and took a few more hurried steps . A scrabbling sound pulled her up short . She jerked her head to the right . What on earth was that ? It sounded as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called . " Happy , is that you ? " The rushing sound stopped . Now there was silence , but a sinister silence . Something was watching her . She could feel the gaze running up and down her body . Her hands turned icy . She took a deep breath . Do n't be silly , Tamara , she told herself sternly . What would be watching you ? A chipmunk ? A squirrel ? Still , a dark wing of fear fluttered inside her . " Happy Face ? " she called again , hopefully , uncertainly . But it was n't the dog . Suddenly footsteps pounded through the underbrush , snapping vines , then smacking against the bare dirt . Tamara whirled blindly , not sure in which direction to run . It did n't matter . In a flash an arm shot out from a slick , dark mass . Some kind of plastic coat . Tamara yelped in fear as the arm clenched around her neck and yanked backward . She dropped the violets she 'd picked earlier . Her heels dragged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly under her chin . Her neck felt as if it were going to snap . Her eyes bulged in fear and shock as she gasped for air . " Wha " A long steel razor with a bone handle flicked open . In one cold , frozen moment Tamara saw the blade glint in a flash of lightning before it slashed viciously across her throat and around her neck , cutting the vocal cords , severing the carotid artery . Blood spurted straight , out , then cascaded down , drenching the sleeve of her white-sweater . " Their throat is an open tomb , " a voice whispered caressingly in her ear as Tamara 's slender body jerked grotesquely in its death throes . The arm released Tamara . She fell in a heap , still twitching , her eyes wide , her blood soaking the dirt . The figure kneeled beside her and tucked a note into the fold of her sweater . Then it stood , bowed in a grotesque imitation of servitude , and wafted silently back into the dark , swaying forest . Rain had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It loped toward Tamara , then abruptly stopped , dropping the stick . It whimpered unhappily . Finally it warily approached the body of the woman who earlier had greeted it so joyously . When it smelled blood , the hair on its back stood up and it crouched , half-crawling to Tamara . It stared at her with warm amber eyes , the smiling look gone from its face . Gently , almost reverently , it lay down and stretched its sleek neck across the gaping slash in hers , protecting her from further harm . As rain poured , the dog howled mournfully into the lonely night .
