Chapter One Granted , Tibby was in a mood . All she could see was change . All anybody talked about was change . She did n't like Bee 's wearing heels for the second day in a row . She felt peevish about Lena 's getting three inches trimmed off her hair . Could n't everybody just leave everything alone for a few minutes ? Tibby was a slow adjuster . In preschool , her teachers had said she had trouble with transitions . Tibby preferred looking backward for information rather than forward . As far as she was concerned , she 'd take a nursery school report card over a fortune-teller any day of the week . It was the cheapest and best self-analysis around . Tibby saw Gilda 's through these same eyes . It was changing . Its glory days of the late nineteen eighties were far behind it . It was showing its age . The once-shiny wood floor was scratched and dull . One of the mirror panels was cracked . The mats looked as old as Tibby , and they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get with the times , offering kickboxing and yoga , according to the big chalkboard , but it did n't look to Tibby like that was helping much . What if it went out of business ? What a horrible thought . Maybe Tibby should buy a subscription of classes here ? No , that would be weird , would n't it ? " Tibby , you ready ? " Lena was looking at her with concerned eyebrows . " What if Gilda 's closes ? " Tibbyopened her mouth , and that was what came out . Carmen , holding the Traveling Pants , Lena , lighting the candles , Bee , fussing with the dimmer switches near the door , all turned to her . " Look at this place . " Tibby gestured around . " I mean , who comes here ? " Lena was puzzled . " I do n't know . Somebody . Women . Yoga people . " " Yoga people ? " Carmen asked . " I do n't know , " Lena said again , laughing . Tibby was the one most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on the surface . Her irrational thoughts about Gilda 's made her feel desperate , like its demise could swallow up their whole existence-like a change in the present could wipe out the past . The past felt fragile to her . But the past was set , right ? It could n't be changed . Why did she feel such a need to protect it ? " I think it 's Pants time , " Carmen said . The snacks were out . The candles were lit . The egregiously bad dance music played . Tibby was n't sure she wanted it to be Pants time yet . She was having enough trouble maintaining control . She was scared of them noticing what all this meant . Too late . Out of Carmen 's arms came the artifacts of their ritual . The Pants , slowly unfolding from their winter compression , seeming to gain strength as they mixed with the special air of Gilda 's . Carmen laid them on the ground , and on top of them the manifesto , written on that first night two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they formed their circle , studying the inscriptions and embroidery that chronicled their summer lives . " Tonight we say good-bye to high school , and bye to Bee for a while , " Carmen said in her ceremonial voice . " We say hello to summer , and hello to the Traveling Pants . " Her voice grew less ceremonial . " Tonight we are not worrying about good-bye to each other . We 're saving that for the beach at the end of the summer . That 's the deal , right ? " Tibby felt like kissing Carmen . Brave as she was , even Carmen was daunted by the implications of looking ahead . " That 's the deal , " Tibby agreed heartily . The last weekend of the summer had already become sacred in their minds . Sacred and feared . The Morgans owned a house right on the beach in Rehoboth . They had offered it to Carmen for that final weekend , in part , Carmen suspected , because they had gotten an au pair from Denmark and felt guilty about not hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer before . The four of them had promised each other in the spring that it would be their weekend . The four of them and nobody else . They all depended upon it . The future was unfurling fast , but whatever happened this summer , that weekend stood between them and the great unknown . They all looked ahead to college in different ways , Tibby knew . They all had different amounts to lose . Bee , in her lonely house , had nothing . Carmen did ; she dreaded saying good-bye to her mother . Tibby feared leaving the familiarity of her chaos . Lena flipped and flopped-one day she was afraid to cut ties , and the next she was dying to get away . The thing they feared equally and powerfully was saying good-bye to one another . After drawing for the Pants ( Tibby won ) , reviewing the rules ( unnecessary , but still part of tradition ) , and taking a brief hiatus to chew down some Gummi Worms , it was at last time for the vow . Like they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To honor the Pants and the Sisterhood And this moment and this summer and the rest of our lives Together and apart . " Only this time , Tibby felt the tears fall when they said " the rest of our lives . " Because in the past that had always seemed like a distant road , and tonight , she knew in her heart , they were already on it . ( Continues ... )
