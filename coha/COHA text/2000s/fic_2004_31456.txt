Prologue " How long ? " Amos ben Sierra Nueva said desperately . " Another forty-five minutes , esteemed sir , " the technician answered in a voice flat with focused concentration . Amos touched the pickup in his ear and turned back to the low hills ahead . They were covered in pine forest , or had been , until about an hour ago . Now they were burning , a furnace of resin-fueled candles fifty meters high . The invaders had barred their own way with the blast of beam-fire from the aircraft , but they seemed lazily indifferent about inflicting casualties on their own forces . The Bethelite nobleman ground his teeth in fury at that lordly disdain ; unfortunately , it seemed justified . For now . Most of the resistance to the Kolnari invasion had come from Bethel 's planetary constabulary , and the Guardians of the Temple . Those few who did n't see the invasion as punishment for the sins of godless young Amos ben Sierra Nueva and his followers had , of course , resisted . The faithful had effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Amos and those followers had been preparing even if their efforts had been made against the day when the Guardians came for them . " Everything is in place , my brother , " said the man beside Amos in the rear seat of the pickup . Joseph ben Said was a commoner-worse than that , a bastard from the slums of Keriss-but he had been the first of Amos ' followers , and had proved to be the most loyal . Not to mention certain skills , Amos reminded himself . " Take me forward to the bunker , " he said , and cut off Joseph 's protest with a brusque chop of his hand . The gunner behind the pintle-mounted launcher swayed as the driver gunned the fans and slid the vehicle down the dirt track . He was inexperienced ; they all were . The Second Revelation had trained in secret with their hoarded weapons , preparing for the Second Exodus to Al Mina . Official Temple policy held there was no need to venture beyond Bethel when three centuries of valiant breeding left the Chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement . There had been no time to acquire much real skill with the tools of destruction . The measures had been insurance , really , in case the Elders actually were willing to use force to prevent the settlement of the Saffron system 's other habitable planet . Ahead , the fire throbbed and roared . The pines were a native variety ; candlestick trees , they were called . They were explosively flammable this time of year , and the air was thick with the heavy resinous smoke . Dust spurted from under the car as they swung behind the bunker , just now thrown up with farming machines and covered with raw dirt . The driver backed and then let the vehicle settle on its flexible skirt , keeping the fans running and the gunner 's line of sight just over the top of the mound . " Good man , " Amos said , thumping him on the shoulder before he hopped down and ducked to enter the bunker . A display film had been tacked to one wall . It showed footage from a pickup located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women in coveralls and caps were talking into communicators or hovering over a schematic display on a rickety camp table . In the bunker , the air was full of a crackling tension , louder to the nerves than the burning forest was to the ears . Amos nodded to ... the officer , he reminded himself . No longer friends and retainers , but warriors . " They are coming , " Rachel bint Damscus said . Her plain bony face was tightly impassive . She was an info-systems specialist , rare for a woman on Bethel , where most females held to traditional feminine careers like medicine or literature . Joseph made her a formal bow . " You are well , lady ? " he said . She gave a curt nod , then turned back to Amos . " They hit the forest with some sort of indirect-fire incendiary weapon , and now they are advancing through it . Powered vehicles . Fusion-bubble neutrino signatures , fairly heavy ones . " " They probably do not know how common bad fires are here , " Amos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry . Bethel vehicles used stressed-storage batteries . Rachel was holding up well , better than he had expected . She had a violent temper , and he suspected a buried streak of hysteria . She was also a claustrophobe : the bunker would add that distress to her burdens . The more credit to her , for conquering her phobia . " They thought to mask their approach in the flames , " he said aloud . Their first ambush had killed several of the invader infantry . Even a few hours had shown how the strangers reacted to a challenge : strike back immediately with overwhelming power . He cleared his throat and asked calmly : " How far are they from the mine ? " " Two kilometers and closing . Closing at twenty kph . Onscreen . " The view through the screen tacked to the wall trembled . That meant something was shaking the ground under the pickup , even though it was spiked to solid rock . Hills rose on either side ahead , everything on fire except for the narrow stream and the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite slopes . Shapes were moving through the burning trees on the lower slopes . Dull-gleaming shapes , hard to make out against the background , as if the surfaces were adapting themselves , chameleon-fashion , as they moved . Low turtle-backed outlines , with long weapons jutting from their sloped forward plates , the barrels built up from coils or rings , some sort of wave-guide or electromagnetic launcher . One fighting vehicle pivoted . The muzzle flashed , bright even through the hot-iron glow of the fires . The viewscreen fogged slightly as a pickup was blasted into plasma , then cleared as the system compensated by spreading input from the others . " Well , that gives us a clue to the sensitivity of their detectors , " Joseph said . He leaned forward . " Everyone is out of there ? " " Falling back to the launching ground . There is nobody within fifteen kilometers , " Rachel said . " We are closest . " " Do it , then , " Amos said . She touched a control surface . The screen flashed white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glare flashed through the bunker , reflected in from the rear entrance but still bright enough to make their goggles darken protectively . Sound and shock followed in a few heartbeats : a roar like God returning in anger , an earthquake rumble through the soil , then a wave of heat and pressure making their ears pop . " So Keriss died , " Rachel said absently , to herself . " Tamik saw it . He said the flash was like the sword of God , and the waves a kilometer high when they broke over the Peninsula mountains . " " Everyone leave , " Amos said quietly , glancing down at the watch woven into his sleeve . There was nothing else to say . Rachel 's family had lived in Keriss , the capital city of Bethel . So had most of Amos ' surviving kindred , and Joseph 's , if he had any . " We will rendezvous in forty minutes at the shuttle . " He paused . " And , Rachel ? " " Yes , sir ? " " Well done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunker , the pillar of cloud was already flattening out high in the stratosphere . ( Continues ... )
