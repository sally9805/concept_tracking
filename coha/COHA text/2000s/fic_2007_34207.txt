" I ca n't believe you missed the game of the season . It was incredible ! " I said , as Greg and I walked toward our lockers . I started reenacting the last moments of the game for him . " Ten seconds left . The Knicks are down by three . Bernard King has the ball . He fakes , turns , and hits a three-point shot . " I threw my hands in the air like I 'd just made a basket . " All net . Ties the game . " Two seconds left , " I continued . " Knicks have the ball and now they 're down by two . The crowd is on the edge of their seats . It 's so intense . " " The ball is passed to King . He does a quick fake , runs down the clock , and boom , he lands another three-point shot . The crowd roars and the Knicks reign supreme ! " As I released my air ball to shoot the winning basket , I rammed right into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I turned around , my archnemesis , the redheaded terror whose life 's mission was to torment me , was on the floor . He was stunned . My mouth was hanging open , and Greg looked like he was about to wet his pants . This was not the way I wanted to start my week . Then , just as I was about to mutter some sort of apology to stall the butt-kicking that would be coming my way , Teresa Johnson ran up to me and gave me a big hug . I managed ahalf smile as she nearly squeezed the life out of me . What was she doing here ? Usually I 'd welcome this type of attention from a girl , but this was Teresa Johnson , and I cringed . Since we were children , Teresa has had this thing for me , and I have never been sure why . Maybe I 'm some sort of challenge . But she has always followed me around Brooklyn , pops up at my house unexpectedly , and calls me all the time . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . There are many days when I hide behind garbage cans to avoid her . And I thought I was going to be free from her when I started going to Corleone Jr . High , on the other side of Brooklyn , far away from our Bed-Stuy neighborhood . But somehow she 's managed to find her way here , too ! " You saved me , " Teresa said . " You 're my Prince Charming . " Obviously her version of what had happened was quite different from reality . She thought I 'd knocked Joey down on purpose . Then , before I knew it , a crowd started forming around us . Uh-oh . This was bad . " You saw that guy harassing me and you came to my rescue , " Teresa went on . " You were jealous , were n't you ? I always knew you liked me . You were just playing hard to get . " I could n't believe what I was hearing  --  and that half the school was hearing it too ! Could this day get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Chris , you 're dead meat . I 'm going to get you for this . " Oh , yeah . I still had to deal with Joey . Usually I would be up and running by now , but that would be pointless . If I admitted that I had n't been protecting Teresa , everyone would know that defeating Joey was a fluke . And for the first time , it felt good to be the one in control instead of the other way around . I decided to take advantage of being in the position of power . " Yeah , sure you 're going to get me back , " I told Joey in a fake brave voice . " You do n't want any more of this . " The crowd roared , and I felt like I really had made the winning shot , even though I was shaking inside . I looked desperately over at Greg , and he cocked his head toward the classrooms . It was probably a good idea to move on before Joey got up and called my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her cute prince later . I was never so eager to get to class . During my next three classes , all I could think about was how Teresa managed to follow me to this school . I started to see her face in the strangest places . When I opened my history book , there she was grinning back at me . When I looked at the poster of the planets in science class , there was her face in place of Saturn . When I screamed , Mr. Burke yelled at me . I knew it was a sign of bad things to come .
