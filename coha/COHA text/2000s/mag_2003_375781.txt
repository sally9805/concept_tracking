When they first pulled his frozen body from a glacier on the Italy-Austria border in 1991 , after some 5,300 years on ice , most experts thought the prehistoric hunter who came to be known as Otzi the Iceman had simply died of exposure . Then came the news two years ago that foul play was involved : an arrowhead embedded deep in his shoulder proved he had been shot from behind . <P> Now the plot is thickening . Scientists announced last week that the Iceman was almost certainly murdered by several attackers  --  but not before putting up a hell of a fight . Moreover , he probably had a friend with him when it happened . <P> That 's at least a plausible explanation for several fresh clues that have emerged in the investigation at the South Tyrol Archaeology Museum in Bolzano , Italy . For one thing , a local medical examiner has determined that Otzi 's torso was bruised and his hand badly cut , suggesting a fight at close quarters . For another , DNA analysis reveals that one of the arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people , which indicates he may well have shot his enemies and retrieved the arrow . And the friend ? Someone else 's blood left stains on the shoulders of Otzi 's leather jacket in a pattern suggesting the Iceman might have been supporting a wounded companion as they tried to escape . <P> It 's not an airtight case : neither companion nor attackers have been found  --  not exactly a surprise in a case this old  --  and most of the evidence is circumstantial . But unless someone comes up with something more , this is the prosecutors ' theory , and they 're sticking with it .  --  M.D.L.
