" He 's dead , Megan . Call it , " Scott Rogan said as he looked at her over the body of the fourteen-year-old boy . " Give it up . " " Tell that to his mother . " She hit the paddles again to try to jump-start the boy 's heart . Come on , Manuel . Come back to us . " I 'm not going to do it without a fight . " " We 've been working on him for the last twenty minutes . " " Then another few wo n't make a difference . " She counted to three and then hit him again . " Live , Manuel , " she whispered . " You have so much to do , so much to see . Do n't let it end like this . " But it had ended , she realized in helpless frustration after another two minutes . Dammit to hell . Poor kid . She ripped her gloves off as she turned away . " Document that the patient died at eleven-oh-five p.m. , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ER to wash and change her bloodstained scrubs . She could n't face the boy 's mother like this . The woman was going to have a bad enough memory to carry for the rest of her life . Damn . She closed her eyes and leaned her head against the jamb of the door for a minute . It should n't be like this . She should be able to domore . " Are you okay , Megan ? " She opened her eyes to see Scott standing beside her . " No . " She straightened . " I wanted a miracle . I did n't get it . " " You did your best . We 're just doctors . We ca n't walk on water . " " I can try . Every day I can try a little harder and maybe someday I 'll be good enough to- " She rubbed her stinging eyes on the back of her hand and turned away . " I ca n't stand here talking . I have to talk to Manuel 's mother . " " Wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her , Megan . " She shook her head . " My job . He was my patient . " But , dammit , she did n't want to do this . It was always a painful responsibility but especially traumatic when it concerned the young . " Thanks anyway , Scott . " He shrugged . " It 's bad for me too . But it does n't tear me up like it does you . Sometimes I wonder why you decided to become a doctor . You 're too damn emotional . All that psychological training we were given in med school did n't get through to you . " " I 'll get used to it . " Her gaze was fixed on the small Latina woman sitting in a chair across the waiting room . A deep pang of sadness surged through her . Dear God , the woman 's hopeful expression as she saw Megan . . . No , she 'd never get used to it . Not in a million years . Then take it on the chin and go tell that mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes anxious . Megan could feel her pain and desperation as if it were her own . It was surrounding her , deluging her , drowning her . She braced herself , fighting to pull away from it . " Megan , " Scott murmured . She shook her head to clear it . " It 's okay . " She moistened her lips and forced herself to start across the room . Get it over with and try to offer the woman what comfort she could . " Mrs. Rivera , I 'm Dr. Megan Blair . " She drew a deep breath . " I 'm sorry to tell you that . . . " He could n't tell who was suffering more , Scott Rogan thought , as he watched Megan take the woman in her arms . Megan should have let him do it . " Stop worrying about her . You ca n't protect your little buddy for the rest of her life . " Scott turned to see Hal Trudeau standing a few feet away . He had n't been in the operating room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts at reviving the kid was probably all over the ward . He wished to hell Hal had not been on duty tonight . Hal was highly competitive and he considered Megan a threat in his climb at the hospital . The first couple years out of medical school could sometimes be a make-or-break period for a doctor . Hal would like nothing better than to make Megan look unprofessional . " I 'm not worried , " Scott said . " She 's handling everything fine . " " I hear she almost fell apart when the kid died . " " She was upset . She did n't fall apart . She 'd never risk a patient 's life by losing her composure . " He turned on his heel . " And everyone in that room will tell you the same thing . Do n't try to stir up trouble over this . The only mistake she made tonight was caring too much and she did n't let it interfere . " " That 's open to argument . I 've heard the chief administrator thinks she gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But then you probably enjoy that emotional side of her . How is she in bed , Scott ? " " I would n't know . " " Sure . That 's why you trail behind her like a stud around a mare in heat . I bet she 's one hot number when she needs to release some of that stored-up energy . I do n't blame you for jumping her . " Hal 's gaze returned to Megan . " She 's not bad-looking . I would n't mind screwing her myself . If she was n't such a stuck-up bitch . " He turned and walked away . Bastard . Scott smothered the surge of irritation that moved through him . He felt like decking the son of a bitch . Yeah , that 's all Megan needed was to have the two of them brawling in the halls over her . Hal was right , the administration was keeping a close eye on Megan . They liked their hospital rolling on greased wheels and even a hint of instability in their personnel scared the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one worked harder . St. Andrews was lucky to have her . She 'd been offered a job in a number of more prestigious hospitals in the Northeast before she 'd graduated . The only reason she 'd stayed in Atlanta was because she had n't wanted to leave her uncle Phillip who had cared for her since her mother had died . Hell , Hal would probably have made a case against family feeling as well . Anything to bring her down . Including accusing her of sleeping around with a married man . The idea was oddly intriguing . What was he thinking ? He and Jana had been married for only two years and they had been good years . Megan had been a good friend to him since med school . He would never have passed chemistry if she had n't drilled him for almost a complete semester . After he 'd married Jana , Megan had been there for both of them . Jana 's young son , Davy , was crazy about her . She 's not bad-looking , Hal had said . Understatement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , glossy dark-brown hair , and those enormous hazel eyes . But none of those features were what drew men to her . Hal had hit the target when he 'd mentioned that stored-up emotional energy that never left her . Even when she was relaxed Scott could sense the emotional turmoil that seemed to electrify her . It was . . . interesting . And arousing . And he had better stop analyzing his responses to Megan . It was n't fair to Jana . He would never be unfaithful but he was beginning to feel guilty . Yes , perhaps it would be better if he made an effort to keep Megan at a distance . Megan 's hand was shaking as she unlocked the door of her SUV . She took a deep breath before she got into the vehicle and started the ignition . She should probably wait until she recovered a little before she left the parking lot but she was n't going to do it . She wanted to get home to Phillip . She needed her uncle 's quiet steadiness and gentleness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent with Delores Rivera . It would be better once she got home . After a few hours , she would regain the balance she had lost in that waiting room . The pain that was rising , roaring , inside her would fade the longer she was away from that grieving woman . Now that was really adult and responsible , she thought with self-disgust . She was planning on running home and dumping all of this depressing angst in Phillip 's lap . God knows she had been doing enough of that in the past few years . Get a grip and give the man a break . She rested her head on the steering wheel , blinking back the stinging tears . So many wild emotions had been hurled at her during those hours . Delores Rivera 's blame and agony and guilt mixed with a dozen other incomprehensible feelings that had mounted until she had been overwhelmed . Do n't think about it . Call Phillip and the sound of his voice would help to make everything all right . No , do n't do that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your own . She drove out of the parking lot and turned left at the light . Phillip called her when she was getting on the freeway . She pressed Connect on her cell phone earpiece for hands-free operation . " Everything all right ? I do n't want to be a worrywart but I knew you got off duty a couple hours ago . If you 're out having a drink with Scott and Jana , just tell me to buzz off . " Lord , she was glad to hear his voice . From the moment he had walked toward her at her mother 's funeral , she had felt this warm sense of belonging whenever she was around him . " No , it was just a rough night . I had a few problems . I 'll tell you about it when I get home . I 'm on my way . What are you doing awake anyway ? It 's after two in the morning . " " I was only dozing . The football game did n't end until midnight . We won in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax . " " Hoorah Falcons . " " Damn right . " He paused . " What kind of problems ? " " A fourteen-year-old boy died on the table . I could n't save him . " " Shit . " " Yeah . How about having a cup of hot chocolate with me and you can tell me about the game ? " " Sounds good . I 'll have it ready . How close are you ? " " I 'm on the freeway . Twenty minutes . " She frowned as blinding lights glared in her rearview mirror . " Cripes , I 've got a tailgater . It 's a truck , I think . He must be drunk . At this time of night you 'd think he 'd realize that he 's got plenty of room to pass me . " The lights were suddenly gone . " Okay , he 's passing in the left lane now . Good riddance . I hope he gets a tick- What the hell ! " The truck had slammed into the side of her 4Runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the highway . " What 's happening , Megan ? " Phillip 's worried voice in her ear . No time to answer him . The truck slammed her again . Crazy bastard . He 'd rammed her against the low bridge over the river . One more hit like that and her SUV might roll over and go into the water . She barely managed to straighten before the truck slammed into her from behind , sending her wheeling wildly in a circle . Straighten out . Get off the bridge . She had a better chance going down the embankment . She straightened back in her lane and pressed the accelerator . " Megan ! " Phillip 's voice . The truck was next to her again . Get off the bridge . She stomped on the accelerator and momentarily left the truck behind her . Twenty yards and she 'd be across the water . The truck was gaining on her . He hit her rear door as she reached the end of the bridge . The 4Runner went off the highway and began bouncing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reached the river . She stomped on the brakes and skittered sideways , slid fifteen yards before she was stopped by a pine tree . Her air bag went off , pinning her to the seat . Helpless . She could see the truck stopped on the road above her and a silhouette moving toward the embankment . He was tall , thin , wearing jeans and a cowboy hat . Her OnStar program was telling her that her air bags had gone off and that they 'd notified 911 . But the man on the bank was already starting down the ridge . Then she heard the sirens . Hurry . Dammit , hurry . The man hesitated and then turned and started climbing back up the embankment . A moment later he was in his truck and driving away . She felt limp with relief . Thank God . Phillip arrived at the scene twenty minutes later . By that time Megan had been helped out of the wrecked SUV and was sitting on the riverbank with a blanket wrapped around her . He handed her a thermal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the caffeine . " She nodded and took a sip . " Actually , I could use a stiff drink . " " I 'd never offer you alcohol at the scene of an accident . You can never tell when the police might try to breathalyze you . " He sat down beside her and tucked the blanket closer around her . " Okay , Megan ? " " No , I 'm mad as hell . " She grimaced . " I could n't even get the license number . I think it was a blue Ford pickup but I 'm not sure . The only thing I 'm certain about is that he 's nutty as a fruitcake and should be taken off the road . He scared me , dammit . When I was sitting pinned in that SUV and he was coming down the embankment , I felt like I was being stalked by Freddy from Elm Street . " She shrugged . " I do n't know . Maybe he 'd regained his senses and was coming down to help me . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck . " " Me too . " Phillip glanced at the policemen measuring and marking the tire tracks . " Do they want you to check in at a hospital ? " " Yes , but I 'm not going to do it . There 's nothing wrong with me but a sore chest and ribs from the air bag . I want to go home . " She shook her head wearily . " It 's been a hell of a night . " He nodded and rose to his feet . " Let me see what I can do . Drink your coffee and leave it to me . " He moved toward the sergeant giving orders on the embankment . Megan felt a surge of affection as she watched him . It was always safe to leave anything and everything to Phillip . He did n't give the impression of brilliance and ultraefficiency , but she had never run across a situation that he could n't handle . Even now , dwarfed by those husky policemen , he quietly dominated the scene . In his early sixties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large blue eyes , he was calm and reassuring . People instinctively responded to that gentle demeanor as she did . Her mother had never even told her she had an uncle , perhaps because he was only Sarah 's half brother and he had moved away when her mother was only a teenager . But from the time Phillip had come to Myrtle Beach to assume guardianship after her mother had died of a heart attack , Megan had known that nothing bad could ever happen to her as long as she had Phillip Blair beside her . And Phillip 's gentle charisma was working its magic once again . She saw the police sergeant hesitate and then shrug and turn away . " Thank you , Sergeant . " Phillip winked at her as he you must n't let me down by having a sudden relapse . " He helped her to her feet . " He asked you to drop in at the precinct to fill out the reports tomorrow or the next day . He 's hoping you 'll remember something more about the hit-and-run . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she climbed the hill toward his car . Lord , she was tired . She could barely put one foot in front of another . " But I do n't think it 's going to happen . " " A shower and bed , " Phillip said . " I 'll take care of everything . Trust me . " Yes , she could trust Phillip . She was trying desperately not to be a burden to him these days . She was n't that bereaved teenage kid any longer . But tonight maybe it would be okay to accept that comfort and strength that was always there for her ...
