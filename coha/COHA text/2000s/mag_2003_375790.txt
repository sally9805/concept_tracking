In the hands of underground-comic pioneer Spain Rodriguez , the 1946 William Lindsay Gresham novel ( later a 1947 movie ) gets the cartoon treatment its subjects  --  hustling and degradation in a 1930s carnival  --  beg for . Magician Stanton Carlisle hatches a plan to pose as a spiritualist to con rich marks , in the process revealing the family history that destroyed his faith in God and man . Nightmare Alley ( Fantagraphics ; 129 pages ) is an existential novel wrapped in a noir chiller , and Rodriguez 's lurid drawings strike just the right balance of sheen and sleaze . Step right up .  --  J.P .
