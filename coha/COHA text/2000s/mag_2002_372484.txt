Celine Dion begins a three-year gig at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas next year . She should be right at home in the city of Siegfried &; Roy . Dion does n't make anything disappear except albums  --  140 million sold worldwide  --  but like the strangely tanned lion tamers , she specializes in providing big , mainstream entertainment with a chimerical twist . <P> Dion was raised in Quebec and learned English as an adolescent , so her lyrical emphasis is slightly but consistently odd . She also sings generic love songs with frightening sincerity ; the combination makes her seem a little bit kooky and a little bit spooky . <P> So who are all the people buying Celine Dion albums , and who will buy her latest , A New Day Has Come ? No doubt the many folks who enjoy a nice voice singing a nice song . Dion 's voice is a strong instrument with terrific range , and on New Day she has even learned to modulate it . On the restrained title track and the ballad I 'm Alive , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go On . The 16 songs , credited to a long list of professional scribes , are mostly pap ; there are the usual third-chorus key changes  --  take it up a notch !  --  and the lyrics are a bland word salad about love and renewal . But they 're nontoxic and fine for singing along with in traffic . <P> Dion falters when she tries to cover the Etta James ' burner At Last . It 's a song that requires soul ; Dion hits all the notes , but there 's a mass-produced , in-flight-magazine impersonality to her version . The chorus is downright chilly . But then , you do n't turn to Celine Dion for love . <P>  --  By Josh Tyrangiel
