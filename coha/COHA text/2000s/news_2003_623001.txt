<p> FOR EACH of the past three years , the financial-services industry has fought an increasingly desperate fight against consumer privacy legislation . Last year alone , the industry spent more than $20 million in campaign contributions and lobbying fees to preserve the ability of banks and insurance companies to sell or share personal customer information without first having to obtain permission . <p> Will this year be any different ? <p> The first test comes today in the Senate Judiciary Committee , which is scheduled to vote on Senate Bill 1 , the latest attempt by Sen. Jackie Speier , D-Hillsborough , to give California consumers control over their personal financial information . <p> California continues to be center stage for the battle of the financial-services industry versus consumer groups and other privacy advocates . A 1999 congressional act gave states the ability to exceed the ludicrously weak federal privacy rules , but so far , no major state has been able to overcome heavy industry resistance . <p> Under the federal law , companies are given great leeway to trade sensitive customer information - from account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without customer permission . And some companies , notably Citigroup , are believed to profit quite handsomely from such practices . <p> Speier 's new bill , co-authored by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton , mostly mirrors the version that was rejected in the previous two years . It would shift the burden to companies to ask customer permission before selling or sharing personal information with telemarketers and other third parties . It would also give customers a chance to restrict the sharing of information within a family of companies - an option that is not now required under federal law . The extension of privacy protections to corporate affiliates and subsidiaries is critical because the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 lifted the Depression-era constraints on the ability of banks to merge and enter new enterprises . Citigroup , for example , now includes more than 1,800 affiliates . <p> The privacy concerns raised by this new financial reality go far beyond the annoyance of telemarketers ( who secretly know your account balance and spending habits ) calling at dinner hour . Consumer groups are justifiably concerned that these databases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose past purchases suggest a lack of financial guile may be profiled for lousy investments . Or a home buyer who had to reveal a family history of heart troubles on a life-insurance application may be summarily rejected for a mortgage . <p> Some Americans may simply object to the spreading of personal financial information as a matter of principle : It 's not a bank 's property to sell and share . <p> As the battle begins anew in Sacramento , there are signs that the industry may be ready , however grudgingly , to work with legislators on a privacy bill . This may be their last shot at having any input on its content . Petitions are about to be circulated for a statewide initiative in March 2004 , and polls show that Californians are anxious to approve protections even stronger than Speier has proposed . <p> Until now , industry lobbyists had feared Sacramento , where Democrats reign , more than Washington . That may be changing with the promotion of Sen. Richard Shelby , R-Ala. , an unabashed privacy advocate , to chair of the Banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how much money is spent ( by industry ) , because this is an important right of the people , " Shelby said at a Sept. 19 hearing on financial privacy . House Republicans appear unlikely to go along with tougher privacy rules , but the upcoming renewal of the Fair Reporting Credit Act will give Shelby and others a chance to press for a strong national law . <p> Closer to home , the industry is facing a grassroots rebellion from cities and counties ( including San Francisco and San Mateo , Contra Costa and Alameda counties ) that have passed local financial-privacy ordinances . Wells Fargo and Bank of America are confident they can overturn those regulations in court before they take effect , but a legal victory for the local governments would leave the financial-services industry with the possibility of hundreds - even thousands - of regulations to follow . It 's a scary prospect for the industry , however remote . <p> And then there is the ultimate wild card - the possibility of scandal - that hovers over an industry trading on personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told financial companies at that September hearing : " It 's my prediction , if we continue along in the current path , there will be the equivalent of Enron and WorldCom one of these days in the privacy field , and we may well end up with a regime that will make you ask , ' How did we get to this point ? ' And the answer is , ' You got there because you - were n't trying to work through to a positive and rational solution . ' " <p> Speier has once again offered a reasoned approach to financial privacy . If banks and insurance powerhouses choose all-out war against SB1 , as they did with its predecessors , it will be at the industry 's peril . Legislators who continue to do the industry 's bidding - most shamefully , by ducking key roll calls , time after time - will risk the wrath of voters who regard privacy as an individual right . <p> Californians , we are confident , eventually will regain control of their personal financial information . The question is whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punched ballots in March 2004 . CHART : HOW SB1 WORKS Here 's how SB1 compares with current federal law in giving customers control of their personal financial information .

It began , <p> " Who should decide whether your bank , broker or insurance company can freely share personal information about you ? If you think you should control that decision , you had better get ready to write to Sacramento . Lobbyists for those industries are working the halls of the state Capitol right now to make sure your privacy rights in this area remain severely limited .
