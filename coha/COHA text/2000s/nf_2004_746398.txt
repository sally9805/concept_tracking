The purposes of this project were to examine : ( a ) weight and physical appearance pressures experienced by collegiate synchronized skaters and ( b ) levels of social physique anxiety among collegiate synchronized skaters . Eighty-six collegiate synchronized skaters from five teams completed a demographic and background questionnaire along with the Social Physique Anxiety Scale ( SPAS ; Hart , Leary , &; Rejeski , 1989 ) and the SYNCHROSKATE ( based on a modification of the CHEER , Reel &; Gill , 1996 and the SKATE , Taylor &; Ste-Marie , 1999 ) . Skaters indicated that they experience moderate weight pressures related to synchronized skating , as well as moderate levels of social physique anxiety . The " ideal " synchronized skating body was consistently described as tall , thin , and strong . The relatively moderate levels of social physique anxiety and few external weight pressures are encouraging findings for those interested in advancing the sport of synchronized skating at the collegiate level . <p> Societal norms and expectations for women to be thin and lean ( Bordo , 1993 ; Brownell , 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal through means such as dieting , exercise , and sport participation ( Hausenblas &; Carron , 1999 ) . Sport provides a unique environment that places one 's body in the spotlight . Female athletes , in particular , may find that not only is their performance evaluated , but that their bodies are judged as well . Numerous research studies have examined the relationship between sport participation and body image . The results have been ambiguous . Several studies have found that sport participation is related to positive or improved body image ( Hausenblas &; Mack , 1999 ; Wilkins , Boland , &; Albinson , 1991 ) , whereas other studies indicate that sport participation is related to poor body image ( Davis , 1992 ; Davis &; Cowles , 1989 ) . <p> Some researchers have suggested that the type of sport plays a role in the experience of body image and weight concerns . In particular , aesthetic , lean and judged sports have been suggested as sport contexts in which female athletes are more likely to experience body and weight concerns and in some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Davis &; Cowles , 1989 ; Hausenblas &; Carron , 1999 ; Petrie , 1996 ) . Aesthetic sports focus on appearance , gracefulness , and physique . Lean sports emphasize low body fat and encourage the belief that low body fat will improve performance . Judged sports involve the subjective evaluation of athletes by experts . It is interesting to note that sports culturally identified as " feminine " and appropriate for girls and women to participate in , such as figure skating , gymnastics , and diving , often fit all three of these descriptors . <p> The environment and atmosphere of aesthetic , lean , and judged sports may contribute to increased body and weight concerns . Stereotyped body ideals and perceived performance benefits of low body fat are two factors that may contribute to body and weight concerns in such sport environments ( Beals , 2000 ; Thompson &; Sherman , 1999 ) . Previous research has identified several sources of weight pressure in judged and aesthetic sports , including attire or team uniforms , judges , teammates , and coaches , as well as self-pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploratory interviews with six former female collegiate athletes , found that team uniforms , teammates , and coach attitudes and behaviors influenced how the participants felt about their bodies . In a study with collegiate swimmers , Reel and Gill ( 2001 ) found that weight pressures included ( a ) feeling that their swimsuits were revealing , ( b ) believing that lower weight enhances performance and that the lightest swimmers have an advantage , ( c ) perceiving that their bodies were being evaluated by spectators , and ( d ) feeling that teammates noticed others ' weight loss . The results of two studies specifically highlight the potential influence of coach feedback on athletes ' weight loss efforts ( Rosen &; Hough , 1988 ; Sundgot-Borgen , 1994 ) . The majority of college gymnasts included in Rosen and Hough 's ( 1988 ) study reported that their coach told them they were too heavy . Similarly , Sundgot-Borgen ( 1994 ) reported that a large percentage of athletes in her study dieted due to coach recommendations . <p> Research has also indicated that perceived weight pressures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges , are related to self-presentational body concerns . Leary ( 1992 ) has explained that self-presentational processes allow a person to monitor and control how others perceive and evaluate them with the hopes of making a positive impression . Self-presentational body concerns are particularly salient in sport settings where one 's body is on display and evaluated by others , as is the case in judged sports . Social physique anxiety ( i.e. , fear of one 's physique being negatively evaluated by others , Hart , Leary , &; Rejeski , 1989 ) is one particular type of self-presentational concern . Research has indicated that among female athletes in aesthetic and lean sports social physique anxiety is related to weight pressures ( Reel &; Gill , 2001 ) , as well as indicators of disordered eating ( Hausenblas &; Mack , 1999 ; Taylor &; Ste-Marie , 1999 ) . <p> One particular lean , aesthetic , judged sport is figure skating , which has been widely criticized for placing too much emphasis on physical appearance ( Brennan , 1997 ; Ryan , 1995 ) . Previous research has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with disordered symptomology ( Rucinski , 1989 ; Taylor &; Ste-Marie , 1999 , 2001 ; Ziegler et al. , 1998 ) . In a study of nationally ranked male and female junior figure skaters , Ziegler et al . ( 1998 ) found that although most reported satisfaction with their body shape , 72% of the female skaters in their study wanted to lose weight . Further , dieting was the weight loss strategy most often used , which is consistent with the findings of Rucinski ( 1989 ) and Taylor and Ste. Marie ( 2001 ) . Taylor and Ste. Marie ( 1999 ) also found that female pairs and dance skaters felt weight pressures associated with skating , including self- and coach pressure to lose weight and judges ' emphasis on the importance of appearance . Additionally , weight pressures were associated with disordered eating attitudes among the skaters . <p> Interestingly , not all research has found that female athletes experience high levels of weight pressure or body concerns ( Hausenblas &; Mack , 1999 ; Krane , Stiles-Shipley , Waldron &; Michalenok , 2001 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krane , Stiles-Shipley et al . ( 2001 ) examined body concerns and eating attitudes among female collegiate athletes and exercisers and found that most participants reported relatively healthy attitudes and behaviors . Interestingly , they also examined athletes in sports with revealing and modest uniforms . The results indicated that athletes did not differ in body dissatisfaction , drive for thinness , bulimia , or social physique anxiety based on their sport uniform . Furthermore , in a study comparing college divers to other athletes and non-athletes , Hausenblas and Mack ( 1999 ) found that the collegiate divers had significantly lower levels of social physique anxiety than other athletes and non-athletes . Several potential explanations were suggested including that the ( a ) divers may have become desensitized to weight pressures and body concerns over time , ( b ) divers who lacked the " ideal " physique may have dropped out , and ( c ) confidence of divers at this competitive level may have outweighed their body concerns . Given the ambiguity in the relationship between aesthetic and lean sports , body and weight concerns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The overall aim of this project was to explore the extent to which collegiate ( n1 ) synchronized skaters feel pressure to achieve a certain physical appearance in terms of body shape and weight . Synchronized skating , a growing discipline within figure skating , truly focuses on appearance , as one of the goals of the sport is to present a precise , uniform look on the ice . Teams are judged on their ability to achieve this goal and use strategies including wearing costumes that create a uniform appearance across different skaters . It seems reasonable , then , that the synchronized skating environment would be one in which skaters may experience body and weight related pressures . Most previous research on body and weight concerns among aesthetic , judged sport athletes has focused on individually performed sports , such as diving , gymnastics , and singles figure skating . A unique aspect of this study is the examination of weight and body pressures experienced by athletes in an aesthetic , judged team sport - synchronized skating . Thus , the specific purposes of this project were to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by collegiate synchronized skaters and ( b ) levels of social physique anxiety among collegiate synchronized skaters . Method <p> Procedures and Participants <p> Self-report surveys were sent to five collegiate synchronized skating teams in the Midwest , all of which had competed in the 1997 Collegiate division of the United States Figure Skating Association ( USFSA ) Synchronized Skating National competition . Eighty-six skaters from five university teams returned completed surveys. ( n2 ) <p> Skaters ranged in age from 18 to 24 years , with a mean age of 19.26 years ( SD = 1.38 ) . On average , skaters had participated in figure skating for 11.35 years ( SD = 3.57 ) , synchronized skating for 4.81 years ( SD = 3.21 ) , and had skated on their current team for 1.64 years ( SD = 0.94 ) . Skaters reported an average current height of 5 ' 5 ? and an average preferred height of 5 ' 6 ? . Additionally , skaters reported an average current weight of 134.69 pounds ( SD = 18.79 ) and an average preferred weight of 123.65 pounds ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Social Physique Anxiety Scale ( SPAS ) ( Hart et al. , 1989 ) and the SYNCHROSKATE ( based on a modification of the CHEER , Reel &; Gill , 1996 and the SKATE , Taylor &; Ste. Marie , 1999 ) . <p> Social Physique Anxiety . The SPAS ( Hart et al. , 1989 ) measures the level of anxiety one experiences when she perceives that others are negatively evaluating her physique or figure . The SPAS consists of 12 self-report items which participants rated on a 5-point Likert scale . Scores can range from 12 to 60 , with higher scores indicating higher levels of social physique anxiety . The SPAS has demonstrated adequate internal reliability ( r = .90 ) and test-retest reliability ( r = .82 , 8 weeks ) ( Hart et al. , 1989 ) . Additionally , the SPAS has demonstrated construct and criterion-related validity ( see Hart et al. , 1989 ) . Some debate has emerged regarding the influence item 2 , as it is negatively worded , on the internal consistency of the SPAS . All 12 items were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the SPAS was determined with and without item 2 and the alpha coefficients were the same . In the present study , the SPAS had good internal consistency , alpha = .88 . <p> SYNCHROSKATE . The SYNCHROSKATE ( based on a modification of the CHEER , Reel &; Gill , 1992 and the SKATE , Taylor &; Ste. Marie , 1999 ) consisted of three sections designed to assess weight related pressures within synchronized skating . Items included in this measure refer to skaters ' own attitudes , as well as , the coach , teammates , and skating judges . The first section ( part A ) consists of 33 Likert scaled items ( 1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree ) that measure general and skating related weight pressures . All items were reverse scored such that a high total score on part A of the SYNCHROSKATE reflected higher levels of perceived weight pressures . Representative items on the SYNCHROSKATE include " I feel that the lightest female skaters are at a distinct performance advantage , " " My coach notices if I gain weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me concerned about my weight and appearance , " and " The judges encourage maintenance of below average weight " ( see Table 1 for a complete list of items ) . The CHEER , the basis for the SYNCHROSKATE , has demonstrated adequate internal consistency ( Reel &; Gill , 1996 ) . In the present study , the internal consistency of part A of the SYNCHROSKATE was calculated . Three items ( " I encourage participation in a weight-training program during the season , " " My coach encourages participation in a weight-training program during the season , " and " My teammates encourage participation in a weight-training program during the season " ) were deleted from part A of the SYNCHROSKATE because of low corrected item-total correlations . After deleting those items , the internal consistency for part A the SYNCHROSKATE was .92 . <p> The second section ( part B ) of the SYNCHROSKATE consisted of two " yes/no " questions : " Are there weight pressures associated with synchronized skating to lose weight or maintain a below average weight ? " and " Are there pressures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals for synchronized skating ? " The final section ( part C ) of the SYNCHROSKATE included open-ended items pertaining to skaters ' perceptions of the " ideal " synchronized skating body and strategies used to meet that " ideal , " team weight policies , and weight pressures experienced within synchronized skating . Data from these open-ended items was content analyzed . Each response was coded with a label representing the main ideas of the response and like labels were then grouped together . Results <p> Weight Pressures <p> In part A of the SYNCHROSKATE , participants were asked to rate their agreement with each item pertaining to weight pressures within synchronized skating . Frequencies were calculated for each item and then converted into percentages ( see Table 1 ) . A large percentage of skaters strongly agreed or agreed with several items related to general self-imposed weight pressures including : " I notice if I gain weight " ( 94.2% ) , " Body weight and appearance are important to me " ( 91.9% ) , " I encourage participation in weight control techniques " ( 67.4% ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my weight and appearance " ( 65.9% ) . <p> Additionally , skaters strongly agreed or agreed with several skating related items , including : " I encourage participation in a weight training program during the season " ( 87.2% ) , " My precision skating uniform makes me conscious of my bodily appearance " ( 67.4% ) , and " I think my skating would improve if I lost 5 pounds " ( 45.3% ) . Finally , over half of the skaters strongly agreed or agreed that body weight and appearance were important to the judges ( 64.0% ) , their coach ( 57.0% ) , and their teammates ( 54.7% ) . When asked if there are weight pressures associated with synchronized skating to lose weight or maintain a below average weight in Part B of the SYNCHROSKATE , 48.8% of the skaters responded " yes " and 51.2% responded " no . " Similarly , when asked if there are pressures to look a certain way or pressure to meet body ideals for synchronized skating , 58.1% of the skaters indicated " yes " and 41.9% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Skaters described the " ideal " synchronized skating body in response to an open-ended item in part C of the SYNCHROSKATE . For example , skaters wrote the following to describe the " ideal " synchronized skating body : " athletic , slim , strong , and somewhat muscular , " " muscular legs , smaller physique , toned body , " and " skinny legs ( thighs especially ) , skinny flat stomach , firm little butt , and very petite . " The descriptions were extremely consistent across participants and three main characteristics of the " ideal " body emerged : height , shape/weight , and strength/muscularity . Thirty-six of the participants ' descriptions included references to height ; 21 of these indicated that the " ideal " synchronized skater was " tall , " although no specific height was consistently reported . References to body shape and weight were in 50 of the " ideal " synchronized skating body descriptions , which focused on " thinness . " Finally , strength and muscularity were included in 44 of the descriptions . Overall , participants consistently reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tall , thin and strong . <p> While there was little variation from this perceived " ideal " synchronized skating body , there were a variety of perspectives on the importance of an ideal skating body in synchronized skating . For example , one participant wrote , " Precision skating can be a very positive thing , but in the last few years it has become incredibly image conscious and put a huge emphasis on aesthetics , " while another participant wrote , " I think precision skating is a pretty relaxed atmosphere , especially at the collegiate level , we are more concerned with having fun and skating our best ... " In response to an open-ended question about strategies used to improve one 's physique and become more like the " ideal , " skaters indicated that diet , exercise , and a combination of diet and exercise were strategies used in efforts to meet perceived body ideals . Only five skaters reported dieting as their main strategy , while 33 skaters reported using a combination of diet and exercise . Twelve skaters indicated that they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synchronized skating body . Finally , none of the participants reported that their teams had weight requirements or restrictions . <p> Social Physique Anxiety <p> Skaters had a mean SPAS score of 38.56 ( SD = 9.06 ) . Participants ' SPAS scores ranged from 21-58 . In comparison to the results of previous research , skaters in this study reported higher levels of social physique anxiety than other female athletes in lean sports ( Hausenblas &; Mack , 1999 ; Reel &; Gill , 1996 , 2001 ; VanRaalte , Schmelzer , Smith &; Brewer , 1998 ) . For example , Hausenblas &; Mack ( 1999 ) reported that female elite divers in their study had an average SPAS score of 30.8 ( SD = 8.5 ) , Reel and Gill ( 2001 ) found that collegiate swimmers had an average score of 33.8 ( SD = 9.87 ) , and Reel and Gill ( 1996 ) reported that the female collegiate cheerleaders had an average SPAS score of 33.0 ( no SD reported ) . Although the mean SPAS score of the synchronized skaters was above that found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total possible scores is 36 , an average of 38.56 is still within the moderate range . <p> SPAS scores were positively related to total scores on part A of the SYNCHROSKATE ( r = 0.37 , p&lt;.001 ) , as well as , body mass index ( BMI ) , calculated using participants ' self-reported height and weight ( r = . 31 , p&lt;. 005 ) . Additionally , scores on several individual items in part A of the SYNCHROSKATE were correlated with SPAS scores ( see Table 2 ) . To further examine how social physique anxiety , a relatively stable personality characteristic , contributed to skaters ' perceived weight pressures within synchronized skating , a regression analysis was conducted . SPAS scores accounted for 13% of the variance in scores on part A of the SYNCHROSKATE , F ( 1,82 ) = 12.69 , p&lt;.001 . BMI was entered in the regression equation , however it did not significantly contribute to the variance . Discussion <p> The purpose of this study was to examine weight pressures and social physique anxiety experienced by collegiate synchronized skaters . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , the collegiate synchronized skaters reported experiencing some weight pressures . Second , the weight pressures reported by the skaters were related primarily to self-imposed pressures . Third , skaters indicated that their synchronized skating uniforms did increase their awareness and consciousness of their bodies and appearance . Finally , the overall picture of weight pressures in figure skating was not as negative as has been previously portrayed by the media within other disciplines of figure skating , such as singles and pair skating ( Ryan , 1995 ) . <p> Collegiate synchronized skaters in this study reported experiencing moderate weight pressures . Almost half of the skaters felt that there was pressure to lose weight and over half felt pressure to have an " ideal " skating physique . It is not surprising that the synchronized skaters in this study reported experiencing weight pressures . The stereotyped body ideals of figure skating are quite narrow and skaters are typically well aware of the expectation that they be thin and lean . The participants in this study had been skating an average of 11 years and had been involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , it is not unreasonable to suggest that along with this level of skating experience comes an awareness of the weight pressures and expectations within the sport . Additionally , similar weight pressures and expectations have been reported in previous research with women involved in aesthetic and lean sports ( Brownell , Rodin , &; Wilmore , 1992 ; Sundgot-Borgen , 1994 ) . <p> Second , the weight pressures experienced by the synchronized skaters were related primarily to self-imposed pressures and expectations . For example , skaters overwhelmingly agreed that they notice when they gain weight and that body weight and appearance are important to them . These findings are similar to the findings of Reel and Gill ( 1996,2001 ) and Taylor and Ste. Marie ( 1999 ) . Taylor and Ste. Marie ( 1999 ) found that 80% of the weight and body related pressures experienced by female pairs skaters and ice dancers were self-related pressures . Similarly , Reel and Gill ( 1996 ) found that female college cheerleaders reported being aware of their physiques and feeling that their performance would improve with weight loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a role in explaining the skaters self-imposed weight pressures . The weight dissatisfaction reported by the skaters is similar to that reported in the general population . For example , most of the skaters wanted to lose weight , an average of 11 pounds , which is congruent with weight dissatisfaction findings from a survey of the general population ( Garner , 1997 ) . One skater wrote , " I think the pressures of appearance for young women within skating ... are the same for women everyday . " Additionally , the skaters described their " ideal " skating body as tall , thin , and lean . Similarly , Krane , Waldron , Michalenok , and Stiles-Shipley ( 2001 ) found that athletes wanted to lose weight and reported ideal bodies that included being thinner , having low body fat , having a tight and toned body , and having a muscular body . This idealized body identified by female athletes is consistent with societal expectations for women , as well as with women 's desired physique in general ( Bordo , 1993 ) . Thus , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some female athletes may not be all that different from those experienced by women in general . <p> Third , the results of this study indicated that synchronized skating uniforms ( i.e. , tight fitting skating dresses that reveal much of the skaters ' legs ) may intensify an awareness and consciousness of one 's physique and body . Over two-thirds of the skaters in this study reported that their skating uniform made them conscious of their appearance . Similarly , Krane , Waldron and colleagues ( 2001 ) suggested that athletic uniforms may increase body concerns , especially among athletes who perceive that their bodies do not meet stereotyped ideals . Within the larger context of sport , considering uniforms as a source of weight and physique pressure may seem like a relatively unimportant issue . Yet , it may be useful for researchers to investigate the potential influence of uniforms on body image , as well as other psychological constructs such as confidence and anxiety . Martin and Mack ( 1996 ) , for example , found that competitive trait anxiety was associated with social physique anxiety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not only create discomfort or self-consciousness in terms of worrying about how one 's body appears , but may also influence other psychological factors that have the potential to negatively impact enjoyment and performance ( Greenleaf , 2002 ) . <p> Finally , the overall picture of body concerns and weight pressures within figure skating was not as bleak as might be expected given the negative media coverage of other figure skating disciplines , such as singles and pair skating ( Ryan , 1995 ) . For example , skaters reported relatively few weight pressures stemming from teammates , coaches , or judges . Although previous research has found that teammates have the potential to influence body dissatisfaction , as well as disordered eating ( Berry &; Howe , 2000 ; Hausenblas &; Carron , 2000 ) , relatively few weight pressures reported by the skaters in this study were related to perceived pressure from their teammates . Additionally , very few skaters reported experiencing weight pressures from their coaches or from the judges . These findings seem in line Krane , Waldron et al . ' s ( 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , female collegiate athletes had positive impressions of their coach 's attitudes and behaviors toward body shape and weight . While skaters did not report strong weight pressures from teammates , coaches , and judges , it is important to note that some skaters did indicate that they felt pressures from these external sources . It may be that certain athletes , possibly those with high social physique anxiety for example , may be sensitive to or highly aware of the attitudes of others . Further research in this area may help clarify which athletes are more sensitive to external weight pressures and how those athletes ' own attitudes and behaviors are impacted . <p> The collegiate synchronized skaters in this study , while not reporting extreme weight pressures , did report moderate social physique anxiety which was greater than that reported by lean sport athletes in previous research ( Hausenblas &; Mack , 1999 ; Reel &; Gill , 2001 ; VanRaalte et al. , 1998 ) . This is interesting because synchronized skating is a team sport ; all skaters perform at the same time as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less conscious of how others are evaluating their physique because they are one of many skaters on the ice , other skaters may experience anxiety because of social comparison . This unique aspect of synchronized skating should be further investigated as researchers and practitioners interested in sports for girls and women seek to understand the body and weight experiences within different sport contexts . Additionally , as social physique anxiety has been conceptualized as a relatively stable personality characteristic , future research is warranted to examine personality and contextual factors that may influence the development of social physique anxiety among synchronized skaters . The results of this study also indicate that skaters with high social physique anxiety perceived more weight and physique related pressures than skaters with low social physique anxiety . As high social physique anxiety and weight pressures have been associated with disordered eating ( Hausenblas &; Mack , 1999 ; Taylor &; Ste-Marie , 1999 ) , coaches may be well advised to increase their own awareness of athletes ' body and weight concerns in their efforts to prevent disordered eating . <p> Clearly , the competitive level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived weight pressures . The skaters in this study competed at the collegiate level , which at the time of data collection was not considered highly competitive , and reported moderate weight pressures . Previous research has also found that athletes in less competitive sport environments may not experience extreme weight pressures ( DiBartolo &; Shaffer , 2002 ; Picard , 1999 ) . Similarly , skaters in this study wrote that " At the collegiate level , there is much less pressure to lose weight " and " I do n't feel as much pressure in college to be thin " indicating that the skaters also see a connection between competitive level and weight pressures ( or the lack there of ) . <p> However , in contrast to the findings in this study , other research studies have found that lower level athletes report more negative body image and dissatisfaction than higher level athletes ( Hausenblas &; Symons Downs , 2001 ; Wethington , Flowers , Turner &; DeBate , 2002 ) . For example , Hausenblas and Symons Downs ( 2001 ) , in a meta-analysis , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes . Perhaps more competitive athletes , because of their high level of training and physical activity , may be closer to an " ideal " physique , and thus experience positive body image ( Hausenblas &; Symons Downs , 2001 ) . Given the lack of consistent findings research examining the role of competitive level may be fruitful in providing both researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of how this contextual factor is related to body and weight concerns . <p> As with all research studies , this project had several limitations . One limitation is the relatively small sample . However , data was collected from all teams that had participated at the Collegiate level in the 1997 USFSA Synchronized Skating National competition . Another important limitation to recognize in any survey research is the potential for social desirability effects . In this study , particularly given the use of self-report measures of weight pressures and social physique anxiety , it is possible that participants did not report their experiences , behaviors , and attitudes accurately . Several steps were taken to reduce social desirability effects , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their responses would remain anonymous and asking them to respond honestly and providing participants with individual envelopes to put their completed surveys in before returning them to the researcher . <p> The relatively moderate levels of social physique anxiety and few external weight pressures are encouraging findings for those interested in advancing the sport of synchronized skating at the collegiate level . Synchronized skating at the collegiate level is becoming more and more popular , with approximately 25 university teams established or in development . Given the emerging popularity and growth of collegiate synchronized skating , it is encouraging that , at least with this sample , skaters did not experience the extreme weight pressures typically associated with figure skating . It is unknown what will happen in the future as collegiate synchronized skating becomes more popular , more prevalent , and more competitive . Future research needs to examine weight pressures and body concerns of skaters in different competitive divisions along with the attitudes and behaviors of coaches and judges .
