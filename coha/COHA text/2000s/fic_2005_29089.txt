Dawn Patrol It was cold in the great chamber ; bitter cold . Above , through the frost-edged panes of the glass dome overhead , the stars glittered like phraxdust in the black sky . Below , at the large ring-shaped ironwood table , a hulking figure was hunched over a sheaf of sky charts , a carved tankard in front of him , and an upturned telescope by the foot of his chair . Loud snores echoed through the chamber as the figure 's head slumped slowly forwards , a red gobbet of spittle bubbling on his lips . The sky charts rustled like dead leaves as they were caught by an icy draught whistling through the chamber . The academic shivered in his sleep and the light clink of a phraxdust medallion tapping the heavy chain of office round his neck mingled with his snores . He slumped further forward , cheeks wobbling and neck creasing into plump , grublike layers of fat . The dangling phraxdust medallion knocked against the rim of the all but empty tankard . The snores were deep and rumbling now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , the medallion hung down inside the tankard . All at once , with a volcanic snore , the sagging figure fell completely forwards . He slammed his forehead on the edge of the table with a thud - and sat bolt upright . In front of him , there was a hiss , a crackle , a whiff of toasted wood-almonds - and the tankard abruptly exploded . The academic was thrown back from his chair . He landed heavily on the other side of the chamber , twisting a leg and knocking his head sharply against the tiled floor . From high above , like a faulty echo , there came an answering sound of breaking glass and an ear-splitting crash , as something hard and heavy burst through the dome and landed in the middle of the ironwood table , splitting it in two . The academic coughed throatily as he heaved himself painfully to his feet . The air was thick with dust and smoke . His head throbbed , his ears were ringing , and wherever he looked , the after-image of the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He coughed again and again , great convulsions racking his body . At last the coughing subsided , and he fumbled for a spidersilk kerchief and wiped his streaming eyes . Above his head , he saw that several of the glass panels had shattered in the blast . At his feet , the jagged fragments glinted in the moonlight . He frowned as his gaze fell on the object nestling amongst the shards of glass and splinters of wood . It was a stone head dislodged from one of the statues on the roof , the thick frost coating its surface already melting and dripping down onto the floor . Who is it this time ? the academic wondered . Which venerable figure of rank has taken a tumble tonight ? He crouched down , seized the slippery head with both hands , rolled it over - and gasped with sudden foreboding . It was his own face staring back at him . Although it was close to midnight , with the full moon dull and greasy yellow behind the thickening mist , the air - even high up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clammy and warm . The Most High Guardian , Orbix Xaxis , emerged onto the main upper gantry , looked round uneasily , and began at once to fiddle urgently with the metal muzzle that covered his mouth and nose . With the vents closed by spidersilk gauze , Orbix 's face sweated beneath the mask and his voice took on a muffled and rasping tone - but at least it protected him from the vile contagion of the night . The High Guardian clicked the muzzle-guard securely into place . When the great purifying storm finally arrived , he thought with quiet satisfaction , the air would be fit to breathe again , but until that glorious day . . . ' The chosen ones await your bidding , master , ' came a gruff voice behind him . Orbix turned . The cage-master , Mollus Leddix , stood before him . Behind him , flanked by hulking flathead Guardians , were two young librarians , their faces white and drawn . One , a shock of ginger hair matted by a gash in his eyebrow , tried to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fear . His companion , smaller and slightly hunched , stared with pale blue eyes at his feet . Their arms were tied behind their backs . Orbix thrust his muzzle into the smaller one 's face , and took a long , deep sniff . A tear squeezed out from the librarian 's eyelashes and slid down his cheek . ' Very good , ' said Orbix at last . ' Sweet . Tender . . . Caught them in the sewers , did you ? ' ' One of them , master , ' Leddix nodded . ' The other was shot down over Undertown . ' Orbix Xaxis tutted . ' You librarians , ' he said softly . ' Will you never learn that it is we , the Guardians of Night , who are the masters ? ' He nodded to the flatheads . ' Put them in the cage , ' he growled . ' And remove their gags . I want to hear them sing . ' The flatheads tore the knotted rope from the prisoners ' mouths and bundled them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung down from an overhead pulley . One of the Guardians opened the barred door . Another shoved the prisoners inside . The ginger-haired librarian stood stock-still , his head held high . Beside him , his companion followed his example . Orbix snorted . They were all the same , these young librarians . Trying so hard to be brave , to hide their fear - he had yet to meet a single one prepared to plead for his life . A cold fury gripped him . They would be singing soon enough . ' Lower the cage , ' he barked . Leddix gave a signal , and a Guardian stepped forward , released the locking-bolt on the crank-wheel , and began turning . With a lurch , the cage began its long descent . Orbix Xaxis raised his arms and lifted his head . The moonlight glinted on his mask and tinted glasses . ' Thus perish all those who pollute the Great Sky with blasphemous flight ! ' his rasping voice rang out . ' For we , the Guardians , shall purify the Sky , ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' The gantry filled with voices raised in salute . ' Hail , the Great Storm ! Hail , the Great Storm ! ' Far below them now , the cage continued down . Past the dark angular Tower of Night it went ; past the surface of the crumbling Sanctaphrax rock and the vast network of scaffolding erected to support it , and on down into Screetown . Inside the cage , the two librarians struggled to keep their balance as they stared out . ' Try not to look down , ' said the ginger-haired one . ' I . . . I ca n't , ' said his companion . ' I saw something down there in the darkness . . . Waiting . . . ' Created when massive chunks of stone had broken off from the crumbling Sanctaphrax rock , fallen and crushed the area of Undertown directly beneath , Screetown was a rubble-strewn wilderness . Every building had been demolished , every street destroyed , while the weight of the immense boulders crashing down was so great that the shock waves had opened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepest of these canyons that the librarians were being lowered . All at once , the cage jerked to a standstill . The two young librarians fell against the bars of the cage as , far above their heads , the voice of the High Guardian rang out . ' Come , Demons of the Deep ! ' he cried . ' And rid the Sky of its polluters ! ' He turned to Leddix . ' Release them , ' he hissed . From the Hardcover edition .
