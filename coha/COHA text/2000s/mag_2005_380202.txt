The Year in Medicine <P> Our year-end overview of the biggest news in medical research and health care drew praise from doctors and patients alike . Some readers let us know about a few breakthroughs we overlooked . Others decried the problems faced by the millions of Americans without health insurance <P> I enjoyed reading " The Year in Medicine from A to Z " Dec. 5 and appreciate that valuable update . You missed an opportunity , however , to tell your readers about the minimally invasive technique of carotid stenting for the treatment of carotid-artery blockage . The procedure became available this year , following FDA approval of the devices in 2004 . Carotid stenting can be performed in even high-risk patients who are not candidates for surgery . That means perhaps 30% or more of ischemic strokes can be avoided , saving thousands of lives and averting severe physical incapacity . RENAN UFLACKER , M.D. Mount Pleasant , S.C . <P> Thank you for a solid overview of medical advances that have a high potential for making a significant difference in our lives . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly vaccines for disease prevention and treatment  --  it is wiser still to keep in mind that we all have within us the capacity to live fuller and healthier lives . GARY D. GILMORE La Crosse , Wis . <P> The item on Alzheimer 's , welcome as it was , speaks of patients . But attention must also be paid to the sole at-home caregiver  --  wife , daughter , husband , son  --  who copes with years of unceasing care for a loved one , as witness to a kind of death in slow motion . We need to better understand the impact of the relentless pressure on the health of those who attend to Alzheimer 's patients . That should be the subject of serious ongoing research . What is certain is that as people live longer , Alzheimer 's will increasingly dominate our lives . KEITH GLEGG L'Orignal , Ont . <P> Your article was very comprehensive but failed to mention the biggest problem plaguing the U.S. : our two-tiered health-care system . Although those fortunate enough to have employer-provided health insurance or rich enough to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are still 46 million Americans who do not have even basic health insurance . Moreover , it is precisely the new drugs and technology that are driving up the cost of health care , and a lot of that money is going into the pockets of drug-company shareholders . New tools do not necessarily translate into better health . We can not say we have made true progress in the field of medicine until we fix the appalling inequities of America 's health-care system . ELLEN WU Oakland , Calif . <P> The entry on marijuana stated " research into the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of cannabis bolsters the case for medicinal use of marijuana . " The studies cited , however , involved the use of cannabis extracts and synthetic marijuana chemicals , not smoking pot , as some readers might surmise . The research suggests that there are excellent ways to utilize the active ingredients in marijuana without legalizing another lung-polluting substance . The time has come for the prescription use of cannabis derivatives . TERRY K. KAISER San Diego        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
