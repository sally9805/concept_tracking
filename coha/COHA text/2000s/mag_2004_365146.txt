Thursday next is a detective in charge of solving crimes that happen in books . Which is to say , she literally goes into books and solves crimes there . If , say , somebody were to kidnap Jane Eyre out of Jane Eyre ( which happened in The Eyre Affair , the first Thursday Next novel ) , Thursday would be on the case . This is what the British call silliness , and people generally find it either dismal or delightful . If you 're in the latter camp , prepare to be delighted by Jasper Fforde 's Something Rotten ( Viking ; 385 pages ) , the fourth book in the Next series . <P> This time Thursday is operating in the real world , pursuing a malevolent fictional character named Yorrick Kaine , who has managed to escape his native novel and is trying to become dictator of Britain . The narrative involves the Cheshire cat , cloned Neanderthals , Thursday 's 2-year-old son ( who is named , inevitably , Friday ) , time travel , Beowulf and Hamlet . We are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamlet by the characters of The Merry Wives of Windsor . Fun , but Fforde 's cheerfulness is relentless . Genuine pathos can be found in the interplay between the world of fiction and its drabber , realer counterpart , but Fforde does n't go looking for it . He is always charming company , and if he sometimes strays too far into fantasy , well , what 's so great about reality ? " If the real world were a book , " Hamlet remarks , " it would never find a publisher . "  --  By Lev Grossman
