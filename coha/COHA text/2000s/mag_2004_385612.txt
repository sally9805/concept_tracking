Section : WOMEN who ROCK America 's answer to the Clash - three girls who drink peppermint tea and kick ass <p> FLASHBACK , APRIL 1996 : SLEATER-KINNEY ARE PLAYING a gig in Charlottes ville , Virginia , in the basement of the local sushi bar Tokyo Rose . Their first big album , Call the Doctor , has just come out , and the basement is packed . Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein stand on the tiny stage with their guitars , just a drummer behind them . No bass , I guess . They ask the girls in the house to come up front and then start bashing away . <p> My friend Jeanine screams and throws her bra onstage . It hits Tucker 's mike , and Tucker lets it dangle there the rest of the show . None of us have ever heard anything like this . I ca n't believe two guitars can make such a ferocious noise . <p> Tucker and Brownstein trade off vocals in their hilarious sex anthem " I Wan na Be Your Joey Ramone . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I can see , " Tucker screams . " I 'm the queen of rock &; roll ! " My date waves goodbye and rushes up front . Some drunk dipshits with mohawks wo n't stop slamming into people . There 's no security here , so my friend Darius tries to throw them out . I jump in and help him drag them outside . I have n't been in a fistfight since elementary school , much less won one , but I know I 'm going to win this one - where all this testosterone is coming from , I have no idea . Tucker says , " Are you having a problem , boys ? Well , if you ca n't handle it ... we can ! Right , ladies ? " <p> We do n't just come out of that show with a new favorite band - we come away feeling like we can conquer the world , start our own bands , do anything . It 's the most amazing punk-rock show I 've ever seen . <p> SLEATER-KINNEY STARTED AS JUST A friendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs in the living room . Over the years , they have improbably turned into one of the longest-running bands in American punk rock , and one of the best . Their songs are full of sex and love and loss and feminism and rock &; roll - one of their earliest love songs is about wrestling with your lover on the bedroom floor , the aforementioned " I Wan na Be Your Joey Ramone . " The two guitarists used to be a couple ; now one of them is married , with a kid . They 're punk rockers who climax their shows with twenty-minute guitar jams , covering oldies such as Bruce Springsteen 's " The Promised Land . " <p> When Sleater-Kinney started in 1994 , there was room for creative expression in the commercial end of the rock business . Needless to say , now is not such a time . In case you 're reading this in the waiting room outside the cyrogenic-defrosting center , women rock stars have been phased out , and the current biz is n't friendly to either indie bands or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nirvana , Bikini Ball , Hole , the Breeders - imploded , burned out or faded away years ago . Sleater-Kinney have never had a hit , but for a devoted audience , especially what 's left of the underground , they are more than just the best . They are the last band standing . <p> All three members of Sleater-Kinney have reputations as tough customers - their shit-taking days ended before your shit-giving days even began . They 'll gladly vent their opinions about everything from the B-52 's ( whom they love ) to the new Liz Phair album ( which they hate ) to George W. Bush ( just guess ) . They never learned how to tone it down , which only makes their fans love them more . They 're not sure where they can go from here , or even who is listening . They hate getting ignored by the mainstream , yet they 're proud of having built their own scene outside of it . Nobody has ever traveled this far using the punk-rock map , and sometimes it 's a lonely place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marco Polo , " Brownstein says . " There 's all these people with their eyes shut trying to drown out the cacophony of the bad music , searching for each other in the dark . " <p> CARRIE BROWNSTEIN IS THE PUNK die-hard of the band , the last one to move to Portland , Oregon , after years of commuting to rehearsals from the Bohemian stronghold of Olympia , Washington , where she founded the band with Tucker in 1994 . Drummer Janet Weiss joined in 1996 , completing the lineup . Brownstein is one of the few bona fide guitar heroes around , the only person who can do a real Pete Townshend windmill besides Pete himself . She 's charismatic in person , too , although she 's horribly jet-lagged after getting in late the night before from the band 's European tour . She leads me through the streets of downtown Portland in her torn and frayed raincoat and unwashed hair , cool and rumpled , a shabby punk-rock Lt. Columbo . <p> She steers us into a coffee shop she likes , Radiohead 's Hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest and cerebral , with a contagiously loud laugh . Like a lot of naturally intense people , she has a habit of tilting her head sideways when she 's trying to be friendly , yet when she gets impassioned , which is usually , her eye contact could wilt flowers . " We 're not just a feminist band or a punk band or a girl band or whatever , " she says , " I mean , we are , but we 're not only that . We 're all those things at once . " It 's no big surprise that she 's not impressed by the state of mainstream rock . " It 's pretty amazing that the resurrection of rock could n't have been more boring . ' Another white guy with a guitar comes along to save us , thank God ! ' But where are all the girls ? What happened to them ? " <p> When Brownstein and Tucker started playing together in 1994 , as students at Olympia 's Evergreen State College , both were already active in the local music scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her duo Heavens to Betsy . Tucker named the band after a local road ( pronounced slayter , not sleeter ) , but neither of them took it very seriously . " In Olympia at the time , there was a very non-monogamous musical community , " Brownstein says . " Everyone played in , like , ten bands . It was really casual for Corin and me to say , ' Yeah , we should play music together . ' I just remember sitting in my living room writing a song , ' You Ai n't It , ' and we just thought it was funny , bratty and weird . " <p> But the musical connection was different from their regular bands . " It felt a little like something had opened up , " Brownstein says . " I remember we were playing this song , and we had our mikes set up facing each other , and over her part I started singing this counterpart . It was ' Call the Doctor . ' We just stopped , and she was just like , That is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That song was a complete turning point . It just felt like I had fused with her . This bolt of lightning had gone from my chest to hers . And we just said , ' Oh , my God , when we sing together , what is that ? ' It was just ... I could n't even name it . It was so big . " <p> The connection turned romantic . " We started going out and playing music right around the same time , " Brownstein says , " It was short-lived . We were really young , We were a lot more in love with the band . ' <p> Tucker and Brownstein went to Australia together to play their first live shows in the fall of 1994 . For three months they gigged at bars for the price of crashing on the floor , got no sleep , played their guitars in two different keys . The night before they flew back to the States , they stayed up all night recording their first album . As soon as they got back home , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as songwriters , " Brownstein remembers . " The other person had given us something we never could have had with someone else . It was exciting . " <p> It was painful as well . Call the Doctor and the band 's next album , Dig Me Out , are full of heartbreak , especially " One More Hour , " one of the saddest songs ever written . " Well , that song was about me and Corin breaking up , " Brownstein says , her face clouding over . " And that time for me is not particularly sad , but her take on that is really devastating . People responded sc much to ' One More Hour , ' and I ' was always like , ' Yeah , I like that one too , ' but two years later it just hit me , wow , how sad that song is . It 's like , ' This song is so sad . Corin was so sad . All these people are relating to the song , and I 'm totally blind to what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write songs about each other anymore . " <p> CORIN TUCKER HAS THE KIND OF voice that fills up a room . For some people , it 's just a shriek , too much to take , a deal-breaker . For others , though , it 's a soulful wail that makes other singers sound halfway there . We 're meeting for burritos at La Sirenita , the finest taquera in northeast Portland , Tucker 's stomping ground since she left Olympia in 1996 . She lives here with her husband , Lance Bangs , and their two-and-a-half-year-old son , Marshall Tucker Bangs . Being a mom and a self-described housewife has n't mellowed her . As Weiss says , " Corin will be riot grrrl until she dies . " She has a warm , self-deprecating sense of humor that you would n't expect from her music , but she reminds me of a character in a Dashiell Hammett novel - somebody whose pocket you would n't try to pick if you cared about the condition of your fingers . <p> She has fond memories of her band 's early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nerdy , slightly intellectual person , " she says . " When I was growing up in Eugene Oregon , the punk rockers were into mohawks and drugs and crime . And then I moved to Olympia , and it 's suddenly sweater punks . People who drink tea and have long intellectual discussions , starting bands without any musical ability . I was like , ' My people ! ' It blew my mind . " <p> Her son was born nine weeks premature , a terrifying experience that inspired the One Beat song " Sympathy . " In the CD booklet , Tucker wears an old Marshall Tucker Band T-shirt . " It was one of those jokes my husband and I had . We just joked , ' It would be funny to name a kid Marshall Tucker Bangs . ' But then I felt , ' Hey , I really like the name Marshall . ' " <p> " He 's a total boy , " Tucker says about her son . " He loves cars and trucks , squirting us with the hose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband was the director of photography on the latest White Stripes video , and he asked Meg White for one of her spare drum kits . When Tucker got home from the European tour a couple of days ago , she found Marshall rocking out . " There 's this huge drum kit in the middle of the living room , " she says . " A huge Meg White cherry-red Ludwig kit . And Marshall is playing and screaming , ' Drums ! Drums ! ' " <p> After lunch , Tucker takes me on a tour of Portland , driving around to point out some of the local punk landmarks . We end up at the first house where Tucker lived when she hit town . A couple of her friends , social workers in Portland , still live here . They drag me outside to show me a snot on the sidewalk where Tucker wrote her initials in the cement one hot summer night in 1997 . We all stand in a circle on the sidewalk , giggling at the spot where she and a friend wrote " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 6/97 " and " Dykes Rule " in the concrete . It 's a funny moment of time travel , back to the days after Dig Me Out first drooped , a moment when the band was just starting to take off . We 're all cracking up , Tucker the loudest . <p> JANET WEISS COMES OFF AS THE worldly , wiseass big sister to the other two . She is several years older and played in other Portland bands for years before Sleater-Kinney . She still drums in the acclaimed indie band Quasi , with her ex-husband , Sam Coomes . Before joining Sleater-Kinney , she worked in an ad agency . She 's the one who had a shot at a normal , quiet life and turned it down . Weiss grew up in Hollywood and got into punk while she was in college in San Francisco . " I loved going to see the Replacements and the Minutemen , " she recalls . " So much vitality and danger . You never knew what was going to happen . You had no idea what song they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them was going to jump into the audience . It was great . " <p> She was a Sleater-Kinney fan before she joined , but she added a heavy drum attack that gave the music a whole new kick . " I ' was intimidated to play with her , " Tucker remembers . " She was n't in that Olympia crowd . But the first time we played with Janet , she was so powerful . Carrie and I looked at each other and went , ' Oh , my God , we totally got lucky . ' Janet had a real job , but we were like , ' Come on , hit the road ! Join our slacker world ! ' " Weiss has been touring ever since , and she 's seen it all . " It can be pretty gross at skanky , skanky rock clubs , " she says , grimacing . " We still are a bunch of girls . " <p> After a few years on the road , Sleater-Kinney were in rough shape . They were not getting along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brownstein recalls with an evil grin . " I said something really mean to Corin right before we got onstage , and then the mikes were already on , and I walked up toward her , and she goes , ' Get the fuck away from me ! ' Into the mike . I was like , ' Um , hi , we 're Sleater-Kinney . ' It was really weird . " <p> That 's when the band decided to boldly go where punk had never gone before : therapy . " There were these two women in Olympia who specialized in couples therapy , " Brownstein says . " We said , ' Well , we 're a band , but we 're kind of like a big couple . Like a threesome . ' Corin and I had the most issues . It was really hard . " Did it help ? " Definitely . We set up some guidelines about putting our friendships first . Because it 's often two against one . And each one of us has been the one . It 's pretty brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it ? Couples counseling ? Tucker laughs about it now . " If the Clash had gone to a counselor , they could have made some more great records . But , you know , no guy band is gon na go to counseling . No way ! You have to be totally earth-mama , like us . Peppermint tea and counseling ! " <p> So what are the guidelines ? " No evil-minded buddying up , " Weiss says . " No making decisions on tour about band stuff . I ca n't remember the other ones . Oh , wait : Always say you 're sorry . And if someone calls an emergency meeting , you have to oblige . " She pauses . " Although Corin has broken that rule before . " <p> Well , at least she said she was sorry , right ? " I 'm sure she did , " Weiss cackles . " After hours of torture . " <p> Brownstein is one of the few bona fide guitar heroes . <p> " We 're still a bunch of girls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat in RS 932 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Last band standing : Sleater-Kinney onstage at New York 's Coney Island in 2002 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Hot rock : Janet Weiss , Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker ( from left ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Funny , bratty and weird : Sleater-Kinney circa 1997 <p> By Rob Sheffield <p> PHOTOGRAPH BY Bryce Duffy <p> Sleater-Kinney A Discography Sleater-Kinney <p> 1995 ### <p> Bashed out in one all-night session .
