I was surprised to see a white man walk into Joppy 's bar . It 's not just that he was white but he wore an off-white linen suit and shirt with a Panama straw hat and bone shoes over flashing white silk socks . His skin was smooth and pale with just a few freckles . One lick of strawberry-blond hair escaped the band of his hat . He stopped in the doorway , filling it with his large frame , and surveyed the room with pale eyes ; not a color I 'd ever seen in a man 's eyes . When he looked at me I felt a thrill of fear , but that went away quickly because I was used to white people by 1948 . I had spent five years with white men , and women , from Africa to Italy , through Paris , and into the Fatherland itself . I ate with them and slept with them , and I killed enough blue-eyed young men to know that they were just as afraid to die as I was . The white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar where Joppy was running a filthy rag over the marble top . They shook hands and exchanged greetings like old friends . The second thing that surprised me was that he made Joppy nervous . Joppy was a tough ex-heavyweight who was comfortable brawling in the ring or in the street , but he ducked his head and smiled at that white man just like a salesman whose luck had gone bad . I put a dollar down on the bar and made to leave , but before I was off the stool Joppy turned my way and waved me toward them . " Com'on over here , Easy . This here 's somebody I want ya t'meet . " I could feel those pale eyes on me . " This here 's a ole friend'a mines , Easy . Mr. Albright . " " You can call me DeWitt , Easy , " the white man said . His grip was strong but slithery , like a snake coiling around my hand . " Hello , " I said . " Yeah , Easy , " Joppy went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go way back . You know he prob'ly my oldest friend from L.A. Yeah , we go ways back . " " That 's right , " Albright smiled . " It must 've been 1935 when I met Jop . What is it now ? Must be thirteen years . That was back before the war , before every farmer , and his brother 's wife , wanted to come to L.A. " Joppy guffawed at the joke ; I smiled politely . I was wondering what kind of business Joppy had with that man and , along with that , I wondered what kind of business that man could have with me . " Where you from , Easy ? " Mr. Albright asked . " Houston . " " Houston , now that 's a nice town . I go down there sometimes , on business . " He smiled for a moment . He had all the time in the world . " What kind of work you do up here ? " Up close his eyes were the color of robins ' eggs ; matte and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days ago , " Joppy said when I did n't answer . " They laid him off . " Mr. Albright twisted his pink lips , showing his distaste . " That 's too bad . You know these big companies do n't give a damn about you . The budget does n't balance just right and they let ten family men go . You have a family , Easy ? " He had a light drawl like a well-to-do Southern gentleman . " No , just me , that 's all , " I said . " But they do n't know that . For all they know you could have ten kids and one on the way but they let you go just the same . " " That 's right ! " Joppy shouted . His voice sounded like a regiment of men marching through a gravel pit . " Them people own them big companies do n't never even come in to work , they just get on the telephone to find out how they money is . And you know they better get a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albright laughed and slapped Joppy on the arm . " Why do n't you get us some drinks , Joppy ? I 'll have scotch . What 's your pleasure , Easy ? " " Usual ? " Joppy asked me . " Sure . " When Joppy moved away from us Mr. Albright turned to look around the room . He did that every few minutes , turning slightly , checking to see if anything had changed . There was n't much to see though . Joppy 's was a small bar on the second floor of a butchers ' warehouse . His only usual customers were the Negro butchers and it was early enough in the afternoon that they were still hard at work . The odor of rotted meat filled every corner of the building ; there were few people , other than butchers , who could stomach sitting in Joppy 's bar . Joppy brought Mr. Albright 's scotch and a bourbon on the rocks for me . He put them both down and said , " Mr. Albright lookin ' for a man to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work an ' got a mortgage t'pay too . " " That 's hard . " Mr. Albright shook his head again . " Men in big business do n't even notice or care when a workingman wants to try to make something out of himself . " " And you know Easy always tryin ' t'be better . He just got his high school papers from night school and he been threatenin ' on some college . " Joppy wiped the marble bar as he spoke . " And he 's a war hero , Mr. Albright . Easy went in with Patton . Volunteered ! You know he seen him some blood . " " That a fact ? " Albright said . He was n't impressed . " Why do n't we go have a chair , Easy ? Over there by the window . " Joppy 's windows were so dingy that you could n't see out onto 103rd Street . But if you sat at a small cherry table next to them , at least you had the benefit of the dull glow of daylight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy ? The only thing that 's worse than a big company is the bank . They want their money on the first and if you miss the payment , they will have the marshal knocking down your door on the second . " " What 's my business got to do with you , Mr. Albright ? I do n't wan na be rude , but I just met you five minutes ago and now you want to know all my business . " " Well , I thought that Joppy said you needed to get work or you were going to lose your house . " " What 's that got to do with you ? " " I just might need a bright pair of eyes and ears to do a little job for me , Easy . " " And what kind of work is it that you do ? " I asked . I should have gotten up and walked out of there , but he was right about my mortgage . He was right about the banks too . " I used to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just another fella who does favors for friends , and for friends of friends . " " What kind of favors ? " " I do n't know , Easy . " He shrugged his great white shoulders . " Whatever somebody might need . Let 's say that you need to get a message to someone but it 's not , um , convenient for you to do it in person ; well , then you call me and I take the job . You see I always do the job I 'm asked to do , everybody knows that , so I always have lots of work . And sometimes I need a little helper to get the job done . That 's where you come in . " " And how 's that ? " I asked . While he talked it dawned on me that Albright was a lot like a friend I had back in Texas  --  Raymond Alexander was his name but we called him Mouse . Just thinking about Mouse set my teeth on edge . " I need to find somebody and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And who is it you want to  --  " " Easy , " he interrupted . " I can see that you 're a smart man with a lot of very good questions . And I 'd like to talk more about it , but not here . " From his shirt pocket he produced a white card and a white enameled fountain pen . He scrawled on the card and then handed it to me . " Talk to Joppy about me and then , if you want to try it out , come to my office any time after seven tonight . " He downed the shot , smiled at me again , and stood up , straightening his cuffs . He tilted the Panama hat on his head and saluted Joppy , who grinned and waved from behind the bar . Then Mr. DeWitt Albright strolled out of Joppy 's place like a regular customer going home after his afternoon snort . The card had his name printed on it in flourished letters . Below that was the address he 'd scribbled . It was a downtown address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. DeWitt Albright did n't pay for the drinks he ordered .
