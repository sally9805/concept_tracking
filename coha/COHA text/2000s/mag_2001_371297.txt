The borderlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan have become home not only to millions of refugees , but also to countless rumors about the fate of the Taliban government inside Afghanistan . Everyone here , from Pakistani spies to Afghan heroin smugglers , has a different take on the future of Kabul 's despotic clerics . And though much of the gossip about what is happening in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan  --  mass defections of soldiers , for instance  --  is just gossip , there are signs of weakness , hints that the tight core of men around Taliban supreme leader Mullah Mohammed Omar are at the very least anxious about what may be coming their way . Their announcement on Saturday morning , for instance , that they would consider releasing eight Christian missionaries held on charges of spreading religious doctrine , seemed to some a slight tremble of nerves . " If the U.S. stops issuing threats , " a Taliban communique said , " we will take steps for the release of the eight foreigners . " <P> But the threats  --  and the broad international alliance gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some elements of the Taliban 's rule . Until the Sept. 11 suicide attacks , for example , neighboring Pakistan had treated the Taliban with the patience of a father dealing with a delinquent teenager . No longer . Last week Pakistani authorities wasted no time in beginning to consider a replacement for the warrior-clerics ruling Afghanistan . The question is whether isolation and U.S.-led pressure will be enough to collapse the Taliban . <P> For every tale of courage in Afghanistan 's bloody history , there is a corresponding one of betrayal , with loyalties that shift like the desert sands . That shift is beginning against the Taliban 's leadership . Fissures are appearing in the Taliban ranks between hard-liners and so-called moderates , who privately believe that Mohammed Omar 's refusal to hand over terrorist Osama bin Laden is akin to mass suicide . Says Ahmed Rashid , a Pakistani author and expert on the Taliban movement : " The U.S. threat is helping to divide the Taliban . " Rashid says the Taliban 's " fellow travelers , " the tribal leaders who do n't share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , leaving Omar with a die-hard band of devout followers . <P> This is a rift that Pakistani and U.S. intelligence officials are eager to widen . In the border cities of Quetta and Peshawar , Pakistani military intelligence agents are dusting off Afghan war veterans and putting them to work sending out feelers to fellow ex-commanders who are serving the Taliban . Those commanders are being urged to defect in exchange for bribes and the guarantee of a job in the next Afghan government . First indications are promising , according to anti-Taliban sources in both cities . When he asked about arms , one commander from Afghanistan 's Nangarhar province was assured that anti-Taliban groups had already started making large purchases . " This reminds me of the old days when the CIA was pumping in money and arms to fight the Russians . But now it 's Afghans against Afghans , " says an Afghan-affairs specialist in Peshawar . These overtures rattled local clergy enough that they issued warnings to Afghans to choose either " money or Islam . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
