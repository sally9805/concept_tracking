<p> The Washington Redskins have a choice . They can go back to the smash-mouth , run-first identity they had last season in their 5-0 dash to the playoffs and hope for the best . Or they can keep playing as they are now , utterly without a coherent sense of who they are , and continue to look as hopeless as they did in a befuddling 25-22 defeat to the previous winless Titans yesterday . <p> If the Redskins have any doubts about the causes of their 2-4 misery , with the prospect of an all-but-dead season if they lose next week to the Colts in Indianapolis , all they had to do was look across the field at the far less talented Titans . Tennessee had only one thing going for it , but that was enough . The Titans knew who they were . They ran the ball 41 times for 194 yards at an injured Washington defensive line . Rookie quarterback Vince Young was decent , completing 13 of 25 passes for 161 yards , but he served strictly as counterpoint to 178 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calendar back 10 months . What the Titans did to the Redskins was exactly what the Redskins did to six straight foes last winter , including a playoff victory : own the clock , keep the defense off the field and establish primitive domination . <p> After what Coach Joe Gibbs called " a huge bitter disappointment " before a stunned and booing crowd of 88,550 at FedEx Field , the Redskins must do the most serious sort of NFL soul searching about the very nature of the team they send onto the field . Since Gibbs returned to the franchise , his regular season results have been quite poor  --  13-20  --  except for that five-game exceptional burst of old-school Riggo-drill Hog-'em-up football that began last December . Then , as the Redskins beat the Rams , Cardinals , Cowboys , Giants and Eagles by a combined score of 142-69 , the Redskins abandoned any pretense of subtlety . Their two primary running backs carried the ball 174 times while Washington quarterbacks threw only 112 passes . That is n't balance . It 's intimidation , time of possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about playing " Redskin football , " nobody doubted what the cliche meant . Images of John Riggins and the Hogs flashed to mind , as well as deep play-action passes set up by constant ground-game pounding . The team loved it . Every offensive line loves to attack because they outweigh any defensive front , which requires quicker players . And the Redskins ' defense adored the ball-control pattern that kept them rested on the sideline , ready to blitz . Yesterday , Clinton Portis and Mike Sellers carried 17 times for 73 yards . That would be fine production  --  if it represented only the first half . Unfortunately , that was the Redskins ' entire running game . Last season , in its 5-0 run , the Redskins averaged twice as many attempts and yards as they did against Tennessee  --  35 rushes for 161 yards by the two main backs . <p> At the moment , the Redskins are a mess , a team caught between two styles . Do the Redskins keep beating their heads against the wall as they try to put together all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's going to take a while . Seven hundred pages is one heck of an assembly manual . " As soon as we start establishing something , then we go and do some tricky-dicky stuff , " said one veteran . That flimflam has always been part of the highly successful Saunders plan . One Santana Moss reverse gained 35 yards . However , three times the Redskins began possessions with trick plays that made the Redskins seem like an unpolished and scatter-dash outfit . <p> If the Redskins ' defense , which is currently afraid to blitz but ca n't cover anybody , had played slightly better against the Vikings and Titans , Washington might be 4-2 and there 'd be time to master the Saunders offense . But , as this season quickly slips into the rear-view mirror , the Redskins may not have that luxury . If you are n't remotely competitive against the Giants in the Meadowlands , then ca n't win at home against a young mistake-prone Titans team , then what are you going to do when the schedule gets hard ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not going to be calling the plays myself , " Gibbs said in answer to a question about whether he might resume his former duties at some point . <p> However , even if Gibbs does n't call specific plays , he is completely responsible for the overall philosophy of the whole team . Right now , he 's let Joe Gibbs football get hijacked while he 's still the captain on watch . Over time , it 's fine to get enough " touches " for skill players on the flanks . But with a true star in Portis , as well as a proven Ladell Betts , 277-pound menace Sellers , Rock Cartwright ( who had a 118-yard game last year ) and 254-pound bench-warming T.J. Duckett , the Redskins may be the most prepared team in the NFL to run the ball up the sinus cavities of its opponents . Who has five such punishing runners ? " It 's like this team was constructed to beat a team like Indianapolis , " said one Redskin , " if we 'll run the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us together  --  special teams , defense , offense  --  that are at fault , " Gibbs said . " When you have things that are ' off ' all the way across the board , that has to start with me . " <p> Things may not be " off " as much as Gibbs fears . His team 's effort is still high even if 10 weeks of results have been abysmal . Internal frictions still stay under wraps . " We handle everything behind closed doors , " said a veteran . " We do n't let anybody see anything . " And Gibbs 's reputation is still above reproach with his players . " Coach Gibbs is a great coach , a phenomenal coach . God forbid he does n't do this coaching anymore , " Sellers said . " We need to play with more heart . " <p> Some teams need to hit bottom before they can rebound . If that 's the case , the Redskins should be informed that they stank . The Titans did n't just block a punt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come entirely free and smother the kick untouched . Hello , in football blocking assignments are counted from the inside out , starting from the center . Is it too much to ask that man " No. 1 " be blocked ? <p> " For our fans to boo , I have n't ever heard that in five years here , " defensive lineman Renaldo Wynn said . " They feel we 're not playing up to our standards . And I feel that way , too . " <p> Eventually , if the Redskins continue to play as poorly as they have in nine of the last 10 weeks , including the ugly exhibition season , it will be logical to conclude that those standards should be lowered . It 's possible they just are not very good . Football is still defined along the lines of scrimmage and except for their effort against the formidable Jacksonville lines , the Redskins ' big men have been handled by almost everybody . <p> In all likelihood , funeral services will be held for the ' 06 Redskin season next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linemen . At 2-5 , with eight of the last nine games against teams with .500-or-better records , the Redskins might still talk the talk , but who 'd listen ? It 's time for the Redskins to make a decision . Who are they ? <p> Last winter they knew . And they were pretty good . Now they do n't . And they 're lousy . The choice should be obvious .
