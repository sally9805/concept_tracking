" Blackthornes and Creeds are like oil and water , " Luke Creed told his brother Sam . " They just do n't mix . " " If that were true , Mom would n't have married a Blackthorne after Dad died , would she ? " Sam replied as he stuffed his mouth full of blueberry pancakes . " I take it back , " Luke said , pouring blueberry syrup over the newest batch of pancakes his sister-in-law had dropped onto his plate . " Oil and water do n't mix , but at least they can coexist in the same space . " " Big brother is always right , " Sam said . " I  --  " Luke waved his fork to cut off his older brother . " Blackthornes and Creeds are more like gasoline and matches . Put them together and you end up with one helluva blaze . " Too often in his youth , Luke had seen the deadly conflagration burn white hot , destroying without care or conscience . In the twelve years since his mother had married Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family had suffered at Blackthorne hands . His father murdered , his brother crippled , their cattle infected with brucellosis , priceless cutting horses disappearing into thin air , with every disaster leading straight back to some Blackthorne . Which was why Luke dreaded having lunch with his mother and stepfather today . These days , Blackthornes and Creeds were supposed to be one happy family . Luke had n't bought into the fantasy . He looked across the breakfast table at Sam , who would spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair thanks to an " accident " on the high school football field that involved a Blackthorne . " How can you stand working with that Blackthorne bastard day in and day out ? " " At least I 'm working out-of-doors . How can you stand working in a law office in the big city every day ? " Sam replied . It was n't easy for Luke , living in the city , but it beat the alternative  --  working for his stepfather  --  all to hell and back . " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sam said . " Why do n't you come back here and work with me on the ranch ? " " You mean work for Blackjack , " Luke said bitterly . " He owns Three Oaks now . " The two modern-day South Texas ranching families , one rich and powerful , the other poor and struggling , had been mortal enemies since the Civil War , fighting over a piece of land owned by the Creeds along Bitter Creek , a trickle of water that never ran dry , even in the dryest years . Generations of Blackthornes had killed and crippled generations of Creeds in an attempt to force them off that precious piece of land . But the Creeds had hung on . And Three Oaks had remained lodged , like a chicken bone in the throat , smack dab in the middle of the Blackthorne ranching empire , an **25;799;TOOLONG ranch named for that same Bitter Creek . When widower Jackson Blackthorne had married widow Ren Creed , their marriage had united the two families  --  and the two pieces of land . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been over . As far as Luke was concerned , there was too much bad blood between them to end the fight . When Luke had been given the chance to work at Three Oaks , he 'd thrown the offer back in Blackjack 's face . " No thanks , " he 'd snarled . " My father hated you and so do I. Just stay the hell out of my life ! " " What is it you plan to do with your life ? " Blackjack had challenged . " Let me help you , boy . " At the time , Luke had been twenty years old , and the inconsequential boy had been an insult . He 'd replied with a few choice words acquired over years spent working with cowhands who never used a longer word when a four-letter one would do . His tirade had ended , " I do n't want a goddamned thing from you . Ever . " Easy words to say , but they 'd left Luke without a direction for his life . He 'd spent every day up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a Harley . Blackjack had done his best to make amends . He 'd shared his wealth with the Creed kids . Along with his two older sisters Callie and Bay , and his older brother Sam , Luke had been given a trust fund that had made him a millionaire . Unlike them , he had no intention of ever touching Blackjack 's blood money . " You have to stop fighting the inevitable , " Sam said , interrupting Luke 's rumination . " Mom loves him . He loves Mom . " " I 'll never stop fighting those Blackthorne sonsofbitches , " Luke said through tight jaws . " Have you looked at Mom lately ? " Sam asked . " I mean , really looked at her ? " Sam slipped an arm around his wife Emma 's waist , as she dropped another stack of pancakes onto his plate . " Hey , I want some of those ! " The male voice cracked halfway through the sentence and slid down an octave , and the twelve-year-old boy sitting across the table turned red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grins at his adolescent discomfort . " I 'm making another batch for you , Bronc , " Emma said as she crossed and tousled her son 's short , straight brown hair . Luke noticed that Daniel Lucas Creed , better known as Bronc , had the same cowlick on his crown as Luke did . He tried not to notice that sort of thing , and if he did , he tried to ignore it . Bronc might be Luke 's biological son , the result of a one-night stand with Emma , but when Emma and Sam had fallen in love during Emma 's pregnancy and gotten married , the three of them had decided there was no reason to tell Bronc the truth . Luke had been Uncle Luke to the boy from the day he 'd first held the tiny wriggling baby in his large hands . Luke had never regretted his decision . His brother was a great father , and because of complications from his accident , Sam could n't have kids of his own . And Emma and Sam were deeply , happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had two daughters , ten-year-old Brynne and six-year-old Midge , who lived with his ex-wife and her new husband in Houston . His daughters had been away at camp all summer . They were returning the following weekend , and he could hardly wait to see them . " Are you going to stick around for Sunday lunch ? " Sam asked . Luke made a face . If he wanted to see his mother  --  and he did  --  it meant seeing his stepfather , since the two were inseparable . " Yeah . I 'm staying . " " Then how about riding the fence for me this morning ? I ca n't account for some cattle . I think there might be a break in the wire . " In days gone by , the " break " in the three strands of barbed wire strung between cedar posts would have been made by wire cutters , and the cows and their unbranded calves would have strayed onto Blackthorne land  --  where the mavericks would have ended up with a Blackthorne brand on their sleek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all part of the same vast corporate entity , the Bitter Creek Cattle Company , that sort of high jinks did n't make much sense . " Sure , " Luke said . " Where do you want me to look ? " " The south pasture , " Sam said . " We 've made some changes you should know about . " The result of an endless infusion of Blackthorne money , Luke knew . He could n't help resenting the fact that his family had struggled so long and hard to hold onto Three Oaks , hating Blackthornes body and soul , and in the end the ranch had been lost because his mother had fallen in love with the enemy . " We 've put in more bump gates , so you can drive from one pasture to another without getting out of your truck , " Sam said . Luke knew that was a big help to Sam , who could drive himself around , but would have had trouble getting in and out of his truck to open and close a lot of gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grille of a truck and swung closed on a center pivot after the truck had gone through , were a good idea , a smart improvement when the foreman of the ranch was a paraplegic . " I think I 'd rather spend the morning on horseback , " Luke said , " if it 's all the same to you . " Sam shrugged . " I can tell you where the cattle have gone missing . You can trailer your horse there and take off . " Luke dropped his fork on his plate and said , " That was a great breakfast , Emma . If I eat one more flapjack I 'm going to explode . " " I could eat a few more , Mom , " Bronc said . " If it 's no trouble , " he said , catching his father 's surprised look . " He 's a growing boy , " Luke said . All skinny arms and long legs , the same as Luke had been at that age . " It 's no trouble at all , " Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the table . " Excuse me , folks . I 'll see you at the Homestead for lunch . " Sam lived in the foreman 's house at Three Oaks , and Luke walked the short distance from Sam 's house to the stable , liking the feel of the sun on his face . He enjoyed the dryness of the air and the endless flat , grassy prairie , both a sharp contrast to the ever-present humidity and burgeoning humanity that defined Houston . Luke attached a horse trailer to his Chevy truck  --  a ridiculous , gas-guzzling vehicle to have in Houston , considering the distance between his two-bedroom condo downtown and his ex-wife 's house in The Woodlands , a planned community north of the city . But he could n't give up the truck any more than he could turn his back completely on Three Oaks and walk away . He kept his Harley in an old barn at Three Oaks filled with antiquated farm machinery and rode it when he came home for a visit . He 'd carved out a new life for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeWitt &; Blackthorne . The irony had n't escaped him that he was working for a firm that had been started by a Blackthorne and bore that hated name . Slowly but surely over the past six years he 'd spent at D &B,; he 'd earned a reputation as one of the best litigators in the state . In another year , he 'd become a partner and have the financial security that he 'd lived without all his life . Luke had kept his promise to Blackjack . He 'd never asked his stepfather for a thing . When he became a partner at D &B,; his success would be complete , his independence assured . He could look Jackson Blackthorne in the eye and tell him , " Take your million-dollar trust fund and stick it where the sun do n't shine . " Amy Hazeltine Nash urged the bay mare to a gallop and leaned forward , her face in the animal 's mane , urging her mount to even greater speed . Amy needed to escape . She wanted to run away from her problems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do such a thing , riding hell-bent-for-leather was the next best thing . The speed was thrilling , the danger exciting , the escape , unfortunately , temporary . The horse 's breathing was labored and foam flecked the animal 's neck . " Run , Lady , " she whispered in the mare 's ear . " Run ! " The terrain was nearly flat , dotted with an occasional mesquite and the red Santa Gertrudis cattle raised by Jackson Blackthorne and his wife Ren . She 'd borrowed a horse from the stable at Three Oaks and gone riding early this morning at the invitation of Ren , whom she 'd met in town on Friday . " What are you doing here ? " Ren had said when they bumped into each other shopping for groceries in the H.E.B. " I thought you were living in Virginia . " " I 'm home to visit my mom and dad , " Amy said . It was the truth , but by no means the entire story . " I hope you 'll come by and visit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend . " " I ... " Amy felt awkward . Ren 's youngest son had been Amy 's boyfriend all through high school , and Amy had spent more time in Ren 's kitchen in those days than her own . But she 'd dumped Luke when they were seniors and two years later married a much older man , an orthopedic surgeon , and moved to Virginia , where she 'd spent the next eleven years . Last year , she 'd moved back to Texas . " How are your parents ? " Ren asked . " They 're fine , " Amy said . It was the answer she 'd always given . Again , not the entire truth . Actually , not even close to the truth . Her mother was an agoraphobic . Amy had n't know what that was , growing up , only that her mother stayed at home . But agoraphobics were afraid of the outside world , and Amy 's mother never left the house . Which meant that Amy had become responsible for a lot of chores that should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother , but it was plain to Amy that he pitied her . As Amy got older , and her mother  --  and father  --  remained so dependent on her , she began to fear that she 'd be tied to her parents forever . Looking back , Amy could see how Luke Creed , a rebellious troublemaker who did n't follow anyone 's rules , would have appealed to her . Luke had the freedom Amy craved . " Just leave , " Luke had told her when he 'd found out her greatest fear . " I ca n't do that . They need me . " " They 're grown-ups . They can take care of themselves , " he 'd said . It sounded right . It also sounded ruthless . Amy yearned to be as carefree as Luke . She settled for being his girlfriend . For her , getting on the back of his Harley without a helmet and riding around town , her long blond hair flying behind her , was about as much freedom as she was willing to allow herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized how meek she was until she 'd met Luke , who was brash beyond words . He 'd flashed a grin at her , and she 'd been excited and intrigued by having such a " bad boy " interested in her . Being with Luke , who was afraid of nothing , was thrilling after growing up with a mother who was afraid of everything . In hindsight , Amy realized that Luke had been as scared as she was of the love budding between them . He 'd just been better at hiding it behind laughing brown eyes and a cocky smile . Their first physical contact had been more appropriate to kids half their age . He 'd yanked her ponytail and flipped up the back of her skirt . She 'd straightened his collar and run her hand daringly across the few bits of beard sprouting on his face  --  not enough to shave , but enough to announce to the world that he was becoming a man . " You 're someone I 'd like to know better , Amelia Hazeltine , " he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exuding sexual energy that both frightened and excited her . " How do you know my full name ? " she 'd asked . " It 's on that debate trophy in the glass case on the second floor , " he said . " And on the honor roll posted by the principal 's office . And in the program for the fall play . " " You saw the play ? " " You were good , " he said . " You 're good at everything . " " Not everything , " she said , embarrassed by the praise . Especially since she participated in everything at school because it gave her an excuse not to be home . " You 're talented , " he said . " And smart . And pretty . " " Thank you , " she said , thoroughly flustered . " Wanta go out with me ? " She had n't understood why a boy with Luke Creed 's reputation would want to go out with a " good girl " like her . " I do n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . " I 'm only asking you to the movies . " She saw the flush high on his cheekbones , the flicker of anger in his eyes . She 'd insulted him . She would never purposely have hurt anyone 's feelings . She was too sensitive to the flaws in her own family . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Going to a movie sounds like fun . " She liked the smile that reappeared on his face , the twinkle that returned to his eyes . " Great ! " He hooted and hollered in a way that should have embarrassed her , because everybody on the school grounds turned to look . She found herself smiling back at him instead . The first time he 'd kissed her , they 'd been sitting in the balcony of Bitter Creek 's one movie theater . He 'd leaned over in the dark , whispered , " Amy , " and when she 'd turned toward him , he 'd kissed her . On the nose . They 'd both laughed self-consciously . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 'd lowered his head again , and their lips had caught , and held . Amy had forgotten to breathe . She broke the kiss when she felt like she was going to die from want of air , gasping , her chest aching . Other parts of her body ached too , which she found strange and frightening . " Luke , " she whispered . " Luke . " She had n't known how to tell him what she was feeling . Unable to ask him for what she wanted , but desperately needing ... something . " Let 's get out of here , " he said in a gruff voice . When he took her hand to pull her out of her seat , she realized he was trembling . Her legs threatened to buckle and she sat back down . And tugged on his hand to pull him down beside her . " I do n't want to leave , " she said . " Shut up ! " an angry voice whispered behind them . Luke rose and tugged on her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron and rose to follow him . He hurried her down the balcony stairs , only waiting until they were outside in the dark to press her against the side of the brick building . His hands cupped her face , and his eyes were dark and mysterious in the moonlight . " Amy , " he said . " Oh , baby . " He kissed her again , only their lips touching , and she felt something tighten deep inside her . " I want to ... " " What ? " she said . " I want to put my tongue in your mouth . " " Why ? " " I heard it feels good . " " You 've never done it before ? " He shook his head . " But I want to . With you . " Amy made a face . She 'd been watching movie stars kiss her whole life and had wanted to be on the receiving end of one of those romantic embraces . But his tongue ? In her mouth ? " If you do n't like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , Amy , take a chance for once . Do n't be such a scaredy-cat . " It was the name-calling that made her take the risk . Scaredy-cat . She was n't ever going to be afraid like her mother . " All right , " she told him . " Go ahead . But if I do n't like it  --  " " I 'll stop , " he promised her . His thumb caught on the pulse at her throat , and she knew he must have felt it racing . He grinned , then said , " Here goes nothing . " She closed her eyes and waited . She felt something wet on her lips and jerked backward . " I have n't done anything yet , " he protested . " Come back here . " She closed her eyes again and forced herself to relax . This time , she let herself enjoy the feel of his soft , wet tongue caressing her closed lips from one side to the other . To her surprise , her body quivered . Luke slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands around my neck . " She obeyed him , sliding her arms up around his neck and into his hair . That brought her small breasts into contact with his chest , which was surprisingly muscular . He lowered his head again , his mouth closing over hers , his tongue gently seeking entrance , probing at the seam of her lips . " You have to open up for me , baby , " he murmured . Amy sighed in resignation and barely parted her lips . She felt his tongue slide into her mouth and recede . And felt another surprising quiver of excitement . Her hands tightened around his neck , and she leaned her body against his , waiting for the next intrusion . She could feel the texture of his tongue and taste him  --  he tasted good , like buttery popcorn and Coke . Amy had an analytical mind , and she wanted to dissect the experience . But she was starting to feel things she 'd never felt . Heat and need and desire . His tongue was moving in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip and then receding . She sucked on it , to keep it where it was , and heard Luke gasp . They broke the kiss and stared at one another with glazed eyes . " What 's wrong ? " she said . " What did you do ? " " I do n't know . " " You sucked on my tongue , " he accused . " I 'm sorry . " " No , it felt good . Do it again . " Before she could protest , he was kissing her again , his tongue in her mouth , and she sucked on it , like she had before , and felt his body tense beneath her hands . He broke the kiss again and laid his brow against hers . " Oh , God , Amy . Does this feel as good to you as it does to me ? " In response , Amy simply caught him by the ears and pulled his head down to kiss him . She found his lips closed and ran her tongue along the seam , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was almost a sound of pain , but she knew she was n't hurting him . She pressed her tongue against his lips , seeking entrance , and he opened to her . Amy 's tongue slid inside his mouth and he clasped her tight , his tongue dueling with hers , as they each sought to pleasure the other . They were both breathing hard by the time they broke the kiss . Amy 's knees were threatening to buckle again , and her breasts ached . " We better stop this , " she said . " Why ? " Luke said . " You like it , do n't you ? " " That 's not the point . " " That 's precisely the point , " Luke said . " If it feels good , do it . " " Some people have to think of consequences , " Amy said . " To hell with consequences , " Luke said , reaching for her . Amy broke free . " If you want to be my boyfriend , Luke Creed , you will learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Does that mean you 're going to be my girlfriend ? " Amy realized what she 'd done . Partnered up with someone wild and irresponsible , someone who flouted the rules at every turn . It sounded wonderful . " Yes , " she said . " It does . " She 'd kissed him again and used her tongue and enjoyed every long , delicious minute of it . They 'd spent the next four years as inseparable companions , but they 'd never consummated the relationship . Until prom night . The mare had slowed , and Amy realized the animal was laboring to breathe and reined her to a stop . She felt as enervated as the mare , who stood on shaky legs , waiting for Amy to direct her where to go . Amy slid out of the saddle and leaned against the mare , feeling the tears sting her nose and well in her eyes . God , she was such a fool . She 'd wanted someone responsible . Someone reliable . Someone she could count on to stand by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke would never be that man . So she 'd married Carl Nash . And stayed with him for eleven long years , as much a captive as her mother had ever been . Her marriage had ended a year ago . She was free , back in Bitter Creek to visit her parents . Her mother , who still lived within the same four walls . And her father , who still patiently pitied her . Amy 's blond hair was too short for a ponytail these days and she pulled off her Stetson and set it on the saddle horn , then lifted the hair off her nape with both hands , so the breeze could reach the sweat and cool her . She was standing like that , eyes closed , when she heard hoofbeats . " Hey ! " a voice called out to her . " I could n't believe my eyes . It really is you . " Amy felt her heart speed at the sight of Luke . It was as though her thoughts had conjured him . She quickly dropped her hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What a nice surprise , " she said with a smile . She felt her smile widen and did n't try to stop it . She was glad to see him . He was a piece of her past that had been mostly good . For four years , Luke had been her best friend , someone she could tell anything . But what they 'd shared had happened a lifetime ago , when they 'd been kids . She could n't expect things to be the same . She 'd certainly changed . He must have , too . He was dressed much as she was , in a worn Western shirt , jeans and cowboy boots . She had n't spoken to him since the night of her engagement party , when he 'd come to her and begged her not to marry Carl Nash . " You look good , " she said . His brown hair was too long , as usual , down over his ears and his collar . His body was still lean , but his shoulders were broader than they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forearms , where the shirt was rolled up , looked sinewy and strong . His hands were large , but they 'd always been big . They just seemed to fit his body better now . His eyes , the color of sun-ripened tobacco , looked world-weary . That was n't new either . But he seemed more adept at hiding his feelings than he 'd been all those years ago . " I heard you were coming for a visit , " she said . " That 's funny . No one said a word to me about you being here . " She laughed at the indignation in his voice . " I did n't think our paths would cross . " " What are you doing here ? " " Your mom invited me to come riding when I had some free time . " She shrugged . " I had some today . " " Where 's your husband ? " " In Virginia . " She had no desire to tell him about her marriage  --  or how ignominiously it had ended . She could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a woman he believed was married with eyes so full of need . " How are you ? " she asked . " Fine . You look like hell . " She laughed again . " Thanks . I see you 're still incorrigibly honest when tact would serve you better . " " You look exhausted , " he said . " What have you been doing with yourself ? " " I keep busy , " she said evasively . " You nearly ran that horse into the ground . Exorcising demons ? " he asked . " Could be . " She retrieved her hat from the saddle horn and set it low on her forehead . " Where are you going in such a hurry ? " he asked . " I 've got a luncheon engagement . I need to get back . " " Me , too , " Luke said . " Back at the homestead . We can ride together . " Amy realized suddenly that Ren had known Luke would be at lunch when she 'd invited Amy to join them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation . " Fine , " she said , as she stepped back into the saddle . " You talk , I 'll listen . " " What do you want to hear ? " Luke asked . " I know about your divorce , " she said . " How are your kids ? " " I do n't get to see enough of them , " Luke said . " I heard you have a daughter the same age as my eldest . " " Yes . Her name 's Honor . She 's the light of my life . " " How are your parents ? " " They 're fine , " she said . " I 'd ask you about your mother , but I expect I know that better than you , since you have n't seen her yet . " " How do you know that ? " Luke asked . " I spoke with her this morning when I was saddling up at the stable at Three Oaks . She invited me back for lunch . " " I see . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeing her speculatively . " Did you trailer your horse out here ? " " I rode the whole way . " " I 've got a trailer that can take both horses , " Luke said . " Your mare looks like she 'd appreciate the ride . " Amy patted Lady 's neck and said , " You 're right about that . Sure . Why not ? " It did n't take them long to reach Luke 's truck and load their horses onto the trailer . On the way back to the Homestead at Three Oaks Amy said , " Your mother is very proud of you . " " I 've joined the establishment . " " I have to admit I never expected that of you . " Luke glanced at her and said , " Looks like you gave up on me too soon . " " Maybe I did , " she said in a soft voice . He hit the brakes hard and shoved the gearshift into park . The horses snorted their displeasure as they shifted to keep their balance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he demanded . Amy stared at Luke with stricken eyes . He grabbed her arms and turned her to face him . " Because all you have to do is say the word , and I 'll be standing at your door , asking for another chance . Losing you was the biggest mistake  --  " She put her hand over his mouth . " Do n't say things you do n't mean . We 're different people now , Luke . I 've gone on with my life and so have you . We ca n't go back . It 's too late . " His thumb caressed the pulse in her wrist , which was jumping crazily . She pulled her hand free and clutched it against the ache in her chest . His fingertip caught her chin and tipped it up . " I 'm only thirty-two , Amy . So are you . I 'd say that gives us plenty of time for a second try . Just say the word . " It took all the strength Amy had to turn away from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear , low and viciously , before he manhandled the truck into gear and hit the accelerator . The horses whinnied at the sudden lurch of the trailer , and Luke swore again and eased his foot off the gas . He kept his eyes straight ahead as the truck and trailer headed down the dirt road at a more reasonable pace . Amy watched Luke from the corner of her eye and felt a surge of longing and regret . She could ride across the Texas plains all day at a gallop , but Amy knew , deep in her heart , that she 'd turned out every bit as afraid to reach out and grab for life as her agoraphobic mother .
