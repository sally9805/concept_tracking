( SHE LIES ON THE GROUND LOOKING AT THE SKY ) This is the only way to watch the world . This is how you tell what 's important . From here you know that what 's important is n't you . You are so small in the universe . In its vastness , you are lost . In its beauty , you are dirt . ( SHE STANDS ) That 's how white people think we talk . If I were lying on a beach , looking up at the sky , and I was white , they 'd expect me to say " God , it 's hot ! " or " Gee , I hope there are some cute guys on the beach ! " It 's funny what people expect . I do n't expect anything . I mean , just basic things , maybe , like I expect people wo n't walk into me when they 're walking towards me . But people do that . They do it all the time , in all the big cities . And the only reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's room to walk and fewer people . I grew up in a small town . No . Not a reservation . With my mother and my father and my sister . Just the four of us . Four little indians . I hated it . I loved them though . My father had hard time there . He never learned to speak English very well . Although he could say " Another beer , please . " That he could say . One of the most exciting things about being an Indian in the nineteen-sixties was the access to natural drugs . That 's when heritage comes in handy . It offers classic methods of disposal . The first time we did mushrooms  --  my sister Vee and I  --  we bought a pound of butter cookies at the local bakery and ate a head with each cookie . We finished the box . That 's when the lights began to flicker . She accused me of turning them on and off  --  when I knew it was she . She was closer to the light switch . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was by the door . The very door which is near the very light switch of which I spoke . You see , it was she . It was . That 's when she got out of hand . Irrational . You see , I had an old conch shell , my grandfather brought back from Iwo Jima , on my dresser . She thought it was her right ear . She thought her ear had fallen off and landed on my dresser . I picked it up and talked into it . " Hello ! Hello in there ! " She turned green . She said she could feel it  --  my breath entering the side of her head through the seashell and she was about six feet away . I tried to reason with her  --  " No , " I said . " It 's not your ear , it 's my voice . " It was . I could never have talked to her without the shell . Like Rudy Vallee and his megaphone  --  we were nothing without each other . The loudest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me my ear , " she said . " It 's not your ear , ca n't you see that ? Ca n't you hear me ? You could n't hear me if I had your ear . " " What ? " she said . " Speak into it . I ca n't hear you otherwise . " We went back and forth like this for quite some time . You can imagine . Finally , I decided on a daring move . To swallow the shell and take back my voice . We struggled over it . It never made contact with the floor . She jumped on me and stomped on me . When I pushed her off , she went sailing through the window . It was only the second floor thoughmost people would 've survived it . But she fell into the back of Dad 's pick-up that was loaded up with chicken manure . I did n't look until later . It was later , I saw she was dead . And then I looked at the shell , but it was n't a shellit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wo n't hear ever again . She 's on every beach now . I look at the sky because I just might see her . I might see her and I can wave and she 'll come down to me . She has to see me . Because she ca n't hear me . I 've got both her ears now .
