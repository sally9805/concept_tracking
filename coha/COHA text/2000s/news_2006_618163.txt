<p> WWII gains lost ? <p> I just watched the movie " Saving Private Ryan " for the first time in years . What a shame so many young men died so bravely during World War II so that 60 years later middle-class Americans can fund lavish lifestyles for the members of Congress and corporate CEOs . <p> DELMAR ASKEW , Alpharetta <p> Middle East <p> Consider the facts of current fighting <p> Is what we see occurring in southern Lebanon really a result of Israeli aggression ? <p> Perhaps we should consider the fact that it is not Israel that hides behind and carries out operations from among civilian populations ( more commonly referred to as " human shields " ) , but rather the terrorist organization Hezbollah . <p> Perhaps we should consider the fact that Hezbollah is launching missiles from among such civilian populations into Israel , which , in case no one has noticed , are killing Israeli civilians . <p> Perhaps we should consider the fact that Hezbollah does not even recognize Israel 's right to exist . <p> Finally , perhaps we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a terrorist organization bent on bringing about world jihad , by whatever unscrupulous means it can devise . <p> Israeli aggression ? I think not . <p> JIM WYSON , Carrollton <p> Conflict is ages old so U.S. should keep out <p> Since the latest Middle East conflict started I have read countless opinions on what the United States should be doing or saying . How about this ? We do nothing , say nothing , support nobody and just plain mind our own business . The root of of all terrorism stems from the West sticking our noses into cultures we will never understand or change . <p> The people of the Middle East have been fighting among themselves for more than 1,300 years , and it is ridiculous to think that Condoleezza Rice , George Bush or even Jimmy Carter are going to stop these people from killing each other . There has been generation after generation of deep-seated hate that is not going to go away by the signing of a temporary cease-fire . <p> Today it is Israel killing Hezbollah and the Palestinians ; Shiites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genocide in the Sudan . A few years ago it was Iraq and Iran killing each other  --  and Libya has always been a wild card . <p> It will not stop , so why waste American time , money and lives trying ? <p> DEREK TURNEY , Atlanta <p> Wake up to reality of WMDs in Iraq <p> I can not believe that people are still saying there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . What do you call chemical and biological agents ? We know that Saddam Hussein killed thousands of his own people with chemical weapons . Everyone should read " Saddam 's Secrets , " by Saddam 's top military man Georges Sada , which tells how these weapons were shipped out of Iraq . <p> People better wake up . Yes , it is a messy war . But it is WAR , and we can fight them over there or we will fight them here in America . <p> ROBERTA B. LESTER , Douglas <p> Iran may be the Nazi Germany of today <p> There is a startling similarity between now and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Iran is the Nazi Germany of our time . Like Nazi Germany in the 1930s , Iran is threatening many of its neighbors and backing terrorist organizations worldwide . Like Nazi Germany , Iran wants to destroy a people who are now a nation , Israel . <p> As in the past century of long ago , the world sees this happening and is doing nothing , just as it did in the days preceeding World War II . <p> Are we seeing unfolding before our eyes the truth of the saying , " If we do n't learn from the past , we are doomed to repeat it " ? <p> BILL BURNS , Stone Mountain <p> On poker , Mark Bradley <p> After reading The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Saturday , Aug. 5 , I have arrived at two conclusions regarding sports . First  --  poker does not belong in the sports section . Second  --  sports columnist Mark Bradley should be a general manager for some team . He 's wasting his time in such a low-paying sportswriter 's job . He could be making big bucks putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roswell <p> Sales tax holiday : Responses to " Sales tax holiday no favor to consumers , " Letters , Aug. 5 <p> Democrats signed off on the bill <p> A letter writer claims Georgia 's sales tax holiday is some sort of Republican/corporate ploy designed to take from the poor and give to the rich . <p> Actually , a bill signed by Democratic Gov . Roy Barnes in 2002 created the sales tax holiday . State Sen. Tim Golden and Rep. Ron Borders , both Democrats , sponsored the bill . <p> The letter writer 's criticisms would carry more weight if his facts were ... well , facts . The fact that The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published such comments is a testament to the AJC 's willingness to propagate any anti-Republican information , no matter how false . <p> STEVE HADAWAY , Gainesville <p> All politics aside , consumer still wins <p> I was infuriated when I read someone 's comments about the tax-free holiday . Obviously , this person did n't take advantage and shop as I did . The sales were amazing . Not only did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found this to be true in every store I shopped . <p> I am one of those teachers who received the discount card , and I was very grateful for it . I thought giving us the four days was generous . I get so sick of people who find the negative in everything . And what would we do without politicians to blame for everything ? <p> Well , I do n't care if a sales tax holiday is politically motivated ; all I know is that the consumer wins with bargains ! <p> GINA PARRISH , Suwanee <p> Jabs calling event gimmick laughable <p> Store managers must have chuckled at the naive comments of the letter writer who assailed the sales tax holiday , and even staunch liberals must have been embarrassed by the meager attempt to paint the event as a gimmick concocted by those conniving Republicans . ( Surprising to see that President Bush , who has been blamed for everything from the heat wave to Brad Pitt and Jennifer Anniston 's breakup , was n't specifically listed as the instigator of this nefarious plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the letter writer  --  merchants appeared to take advantage of the increased interest and advertised larger-than-usual sales . ( How unique ! ) And the price savings were real , as confirmed by my own experience in Macy 's men 's department . <p> Perhaps next time , the writer could just think of the holiday as the brainchild of , say , Mark Taylor , and do some guilt-free tax-free shopping . <p> PAUL HURST , Marietta <p> Cynthia McKinney : Voter resents her blanket blame game <p> As a voting constituent of the 4th Congressional District , I object to U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney 's ( D-Ga. ) arrogant , ethnocentric , racist and simplistic blame for her defeat . The people of Georgia deserve full consideration as individuals rather than being blamed or labeled as members of some group or particular political affiliation . <p> We the voters deserve , and may now receive , better than McKinney . We deserve better from all our political representatives . We are more than " Democrats " or " Republicans , " " liberals " or " conservatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not whites , blacks , African-Americans or any other hyphenated ethnicity . We are Americans , and Americans who vote . <p> Goodbye , McKinney . <p> ALAN B. SAMS , Tucker <p> Voters now realize they have power <p> A sea of Democrats joined with crossover Republicans to dump Cynthia McKinney . She blamed faulty voting machines , unflattering press coverage . . . everything but herself . What actually happened ? She convinced herself she was above the law , got lots of attention ( for all the wrong reasons ) , and was held accountable by the voters she was supposed to represent . <p> That sounds like the same formula that brought Ralph Reed defeat in the primary . Does this mean voters are finally realizing we have the power to mandate accountability ? If so , it 's about time . <p> So , now what ? Let 's get back to the polls ! Georgia 's general election and congressional midterms are right around the corner . If we want better government , we are going to have to fight for it  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Former rep should take look in mirror <p> Sadly but predictably , Cynthia McKinney and her aides have blamed her defeat in Tuesday 's Democratic primary runoff on the usual suspects : white voters , Republicans , electronic voting machines , and the news media ( and we all know W-H-O her daddy will blame ) . <p> In reality , McKinney lost her seat because she alienated a key component of the Democratic coalition while wearing out her welcome among her base by her constant showboating and divisiveness . If McKinney wants to know who to blame , she should look in a mirror , because she did this to herself . <p> Incidentally , I 'm a liberal Democrat ably represented in the 5th Congressional District by a true civil rights hero , John Lewis , but if I lived in the neighboring district , I certainly would have voted ABC : anybody but Cynthia . <p> JEFFREY SOKOLOW , Atlanta <p> Family planning efforts remain vital <p> We 've come a long way since English economist Thomas R. Malthus in 1798 predicted that human growth eventually would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our planet can not sustain an infinite number of people . <p> Due largely to international family planning efforts , fertility rates have dropped dramatically over the last 50 years . Instead of lawmakers taking this as a sign that such programs are extraordinarily effective and therefore a worthy investment , they have misinterpreted this success to mean their job is done . <p> The world population is 6.5 billion and projected to rise to 9 billion in less than 50 years . That 's an additional 2.5 billion people on the same fixed amount of oil and water , with ever greater per capita consumption rates . Our advances in poverty reduction must be accompanied by investments in family planning or we will certainly reach the unyielding bounds of our resources . <p> KRISTI FUQUA , Atlanta Photo : JOHN SPINK / StaffU.S .
