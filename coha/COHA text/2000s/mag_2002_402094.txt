You cancel your doctor 's appointment because your mom 's too busy to watch the kids , and you ca n't bring them with you to the clinic because of the time your four-year-old stuck a speculum on his nose and ran through the waiting room quacking like a duck . You 're desperate for a little couple time , but ca n't justify the bank loan necessary to cover the cost of a babysitter . Your teenage sitter goes off to university , and you find yourself sending her weepy " Come home soon ! " cards . Chances are , you 've experienced similar child-care crises . But they could be things of the past thanks to babysitting co-ops  --  groups of parents who swap sitting time for more freedom , more peace of mind and more money in their pockets . These five families swear by the benefits of co-op care . We hope their stories will help guide you toward babysitting bliss . Jennifer and Carl Mathews Samantha , age four Cochrane , Alberta Jennifer Mathews heard about the Cochrane Babysitting Co-op through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a past member told her the group , in operation since 1985 , was on a recruiting drive , " I just phoned them up , went to a meeting and was hooked . " This is a fairly formalized co-op with specific rules and regulations . Sits are mostly weekday affairs , and membership is restricted to families with preschoolers . " Once your child hits grade one , " says Mathews , " you 're out of the co-op . " Interested parents are invited to attend a monthly meeting . " After that , the ball starts rolling . " First , every individual in the household over 18 undergoes a police check . Then the chairperson and one other co-op parent visit the prospective member 's home to review co-op criteria and childproofing requirements . At their second meeting , new members pay $2 in exchange for 30 hours ' worth of babysitting tokens . Then , they 're off and sitting . It 's just under two years since Mathews got involved in the co-op , and she ca n't imagine life without it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so occupied I find it easier to get things done . " And what does Mathews do when it 's her turn for kid-free time ? " It 's just nice to go grocery shopping without my little helper . " Type of co-op : Centralized . Payment system : One red " tiddlywinks " token an hour for one child , a red and a blue token for two children . Number of families participating : Up to 12 . Dues : $2 ( one time ) . Rosemarie Schipizky and David Sims Christopher , age four Vancouver , British Columbia Rosemarie Schipizky loves the immediate social network the Douglas Park Babysitting Co-op has given her family . " If the community centre has a Halloween party , we 'll see co-op members there . If we go to the park , we 'll inevitably run into someone from the co-op . " The group holds three or four social events a year  --  such as dances and Easter egg hunts . " That way people who have expressed an interest can come see who we are before they decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Schipizky . The Douglas Park Co-op works on a points system . New members automatically receive 60 points and , should they decide to withdraw from the co-op , have to cash out with the same number of points or pay a penalty . All adults must be non-smoking , certified in CPR and must agree to an RCMP criminal check . Graph Not Transcribed The members of Schipizky 's co-op are a diverse bunch : single parents and couples , stay-at-home parents and those who work partor full-time . Because members ' babysitting needs are as varied as the group itself , individual sits are negotiable . Schipizky tells of one couple who worked overlapping shifts and needed someone to care for their daughters one day a week . Because Schipizky and her husband work part-time , they were able to help out . That flexibility cuts both ways . " We often get offered tickets to an event for that evening , " says Schipizky . The couple 's never had to turn down a last-minute opportunity because they could n't find a sitter . Having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening out . " One of our group is a single mom who had health problems , " says Schipizky . " So we all pitched in to do extra babysitting . She needed certain injections , and some of the members of our group are nurses , so they were able to do that . " Grown-ups are n't the only ones who benefit from this support network . Thanks to the co-op , Schipizky 's son has a bunch of new buddies in the neighbourhood . " He has a great time when he 's looked after by someone else . For him , it 's just a playdate . " Type of co-op : Centralized . Payment system : Two points an hour for one child , three points an hour for two children , four points an hour for three or more children . Number of families participating : Ten . Dues : $10 a year for social functions and administrative costs . Teresa and Jeff Morris Kimberly , age 11 ; Andrea , age nine Winnipeg , Manitoba Teresa Morris was living on the Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babysitting co-ops . At the time Morris  --  who 's a diabetic  --  was making frequent trips to the doctor 's office . " Instead of dragging my two-year-old along , " she says , " I had a couple of girlfriends who would watch her . " But that arrangement was n't always reliable . Then Morris signed up with a co-op . " You do n't feel like you 're begging and always calling on the same person or abusing your friendship . " A couple of years later , Morris moved to Winnipeg , and one of the first things she did was to call up the Winnipeg Military Family Resource Centre ( WMFRC ) and ask if the base had a co-op . The answer was no , but the centre offered administrative support if Morris could round up other interested moms . She did . In 1994 , the WMFRC Childcare Co-op was born . All prospective members submit to military police and provincial child-abuse checks . Once they pass muster , the rules are simple : " Say I went to your house tonight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your record sheet , you would write down the time and how long you had babysitting . I 'd write the same thing down on my sheet , and we 'd keep track of our standing balance that way . " At monthly meetings , the women tally up their totals . " If you 're planning to go out , but find you 're a bit low on points , " says Morris , " you can ask people to phone you to sit for them , so you can rack up the points . " Military life being what it is , Morris 's husband is frequently away for long stretches of time . It 's a relief , she says , to have somewhere to turn when she needs a break from the kids . Type of co-op : Decentralized . Receives administrative support services from the Military Family Resource Centre in Winnipeg . Payment system : Two points an hour for one child , an extra point per hour for each additional child . Number of families participating : Eight . Dues : None . Suzanne Tobin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 21 months Toronto , Ontario A chance meeting at a mothers ' fitness and discussion group led Suzanne Tobin to the inaugural meeting of a babysitting co-op starting up in her community . " At the time , we were really ill informed , " says Tobin . " We just crafted the co-op ourselves and put a simple list of rules together . " That was five years ago . Today , the co-operative is thriving . Some of its founders have moved on , new members have joined and the co-op 's taken on a distinctly ... literary flavour . " We used to meet once a month , " says Tobin , " but realized we did n't have that much to discuss . " Group members did , however , enjoy getting together , so they started a book club . Now monthly meetings alternate between discussions of the latest read and co-op business . Tobin 's group is made up primarily of parents who work outside the home , so sitting usually takes place on weekends and evenings . Typically , her husband , Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to babysit . " It sounds crazy , " she laughs , " but it 's totally refreshing to go to someone else 's house . " After the kids are tucked into bed , Tobin reads , listens to CDs or catches up on her photo albums . No laundry to fold . No dishes to wash . " It 's really phenomenal ! " When it 's Tobin 's turn to cash in a few chips , she 's confident her sons are in capable hands . " These are all experienced moms , " says Tobin . " If there 's ever a problem , they 'll know exactly what to do . " Tobin does have a word of caution about this system : " It does n't work as well if your husband works long hours and ca n't be home with your kids when you go out to babysit . " It 's also not ideal for single parents without support . Type of co-op : Decentralized . Payment system : Two poker chips an hour for one child , three chips an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Ten . Dues : None . Frances Borg Lucas , age 21 months Dartmouth , Nova Scotia Personal need prompted Frances Borg to start the Albro Lake Babysitting Co-op . " I 'm a single parent and have a limited income , " says Borg . " So I 'd rather spend my money on something I can use in my home , be it food or whatever . " The co-op , she says , takes the financial sting out of a night out . Borg first heard about babysitting co-ops at the Dartmouth Family Resource Centre . " One of the moms had done a lot of research online , " she says . Borg saw how the idea could work in her own life and , after talking to a few other parents , decided to champion the cause . " We had a meeting and asked parents what their needs were . Then we spent a lot of time laying down good foundations . " The group 's already seen its efforts pay off . " We started with a base group of three families and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that number will double by the end of 2002 . " For two people , parenting is a tough go , " says Borg . " For one person , it can be immensely isolating . " Even though the co-op is still in its infancy , Borg has already used it to " fund " ten outings . And that , she figures , means she 's had ten more opportunities to rejuvenate and recharge than she could have afforded a year ago . Type of co-op : Decentralized . Receives administrative support through the Dartmouth Family Resource Centre and some funding from a Metro United Way Neighbourhood Building grant . Payment system : One point per child , per hour . Additional points for meals . Number of families participating : Seven . Dues : None . Grown-ups are n't the only ones who benefit from this support network . Thanks to the co-op , four-year-old Christopher Sims has a bunch of new buddies in the neighbourhood . " It sounds crazy , but it 's totally refreshing to go to someone else 's house .
