EDITOR 'S NOTE : Rick Fienberg 's editorial " Evolution : We Ca n't Sit Idly By " ( April issue , page 8 ) prompted a passionate response from readers . Below is a representative sample of the mail we received . // Taking a Stand As a fundamentalist , I could use the same argument concerning our students who are forced to believe that Earth is billions of years old . We do not believe that , so why are students forced to learn this theory ? It takes more faith for me to believe I crawled out of a slime pit than for me to believe in a creator . As an amateur stargazer , I can not look at this beautiful universe as an accident . The change of seasons , the Sun being neither too far away nor too close to sustain life , our own conscience - all scream to me of an intelligent designer . It is ridiculous to believe that chance can cause anything , scientifically , rationally , or theologically . DAVID BROWN Port St. Lucie , FL oriongoblue@webtv.net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S &T.; Fienberg sounded like Chicken Little , sounding the alarm that we must fight to keep the Bible out of schools before it 's too late . He ca n't be serious . Oh , would n't it be horrible if kids learned there was an alternative theory about our origins ! Evolution serves to remove God from the picture , allowing us to escape the dilemma of having to answer to a higher being . Thus , humanists and secularists , no matter how foolish they look , uphold it . It is truly absurd to look at the universe and deny a creator . You 'd never suggest your watch or your car could come about through chance or natural processes . But we reason that the universe did just that ? Preposterous . GREG SUSKIN Rock Hill , SC gregheath@rhtc.net On Christmas Eve 1968 , humanity saw Earth for the first time as a small blue-and-white ball against the vastness of space . On that day , the three Apollo 8 astronauts read the first few verses from Genesis . Science and religion coexisted on that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general population . Sadly , that level of tolerance is gone , replaced by an intolerance that wants to wipe the presence of faith from the public circle . I am saddened to see Sky &; Telescope join the intolerant crowd . I urge you to keep the attacks on Christianity down . Instead , we should enjoy the wonders of the universe together . We can figure out who should get the credit for it as individuals . CURTIS NICOLAISEN Rainbow , CA cjn@tfb.com Fienberg is absolutely right . He correctly identifies the roots of this debate as a general misunderstanding of what science is and thus what is important about science education . What I most appreciate is Fienberg 's tone of respect for differing viewpoints . Too often the folks who are frustrated with the fundamentalist movement resort to sarcasm and satire when they speak out , and disrespect only breeds the sense that we are all on a battleground instead of in a society . He just wants students and teachers to have opportunities to understand the discipline of science . Fienberg notes that good science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build on his point , let 's advocate not just for the protection of science education but also for the notion that an educated person is someone able and inclined to wrestle with intellectual , moral , and social issues . A thinker should draw from deep understandings of different perspectives , including ( but not only ) science . Adopting this notion of education would shift the general public away from butting heads over controlling what students think and can access . Such a shift would lead us to create opportunities for informed , open , and civil discourse in schools . It would lead to understanding how different disciplines construct knowledge , judge claims , and establish truth . It would make room in the curriculum for more ideas , not fewer . In this context , students and teachers could explore perennial , pressing questions about our origins , making school a place where students come to investigate compelling questions , a place where they can be , and are , curious and engaged . Each of us can have some small role to play in this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MA sciences-tudio@att.net It surprises me that Fienberg uses the same type of hype as the " religious fundamentalists " by making statements such as " Astronomers must fight to keep the Bible out of science classrooms before it 's too late . " I 'm not sure why science is so afraid of alternative points of view . If evolution is a " fact , " as Fienberg insists , then it is unassailable and will not fall in the presence of other points of view . Fear tactics work well ( fundamentalists have been using them for decades ) , and now our scientists are resorting to the same level of assault . Are scientists ( and now astronomers ) really that insecure ? For those of us who believe that somewhere between any two views is probably where the truth lies , this complex universe of ours did n't happen by accident . If there are two major theories about the way everything began , why ca n't we honestly present both ? If science has room for facts only , then let 's leave cosmology out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how God made everything , evolutionists have no clue as to the origin of matter or what made it initially go " bang . " So what right does either side have to make territorial claims to science classrooms ? REV . DAVID P. RICHARDS PO Box 7844 Huntington , WV 25778 I find it peculiar that Fienberg 's article made not one , or two , but ihree references to Christian fundamentalists who suggest that Earth is 6,000 years old . As a Christian who attended parochial school and church for most of my 44 years , I can honestly say that I have never heard a pastor or a teacher of any denomination suggest that Earth is anywhere near that young . Yet to read Fienberg 's article , a layman would be led to believe that such information is driven into every Christian 's head on a daily basis . Nothing could be further from the truth . JOHN WILKE 4606 21st St. Circle Greeley , CO 80634 You are right to worry about the future of astronomy teaching , but I worry about the future of astronomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president is creating will lead to a drastic revision of the federal government 's allocation of funding . This could include the underfunding of NASA , ostensibly because it is merely an expensive hobby that the country ca n't afford . Who will defend NASA and the other pure science programs after the creationists have poisoned public opinion by denigrating science and scientists ?
