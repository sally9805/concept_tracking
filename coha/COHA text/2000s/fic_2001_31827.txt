Chapter One Look at that , Sunny ! " the boy exclaimed . Sunniva Lyndall turned and read the sign to which her sixteen-year-old brother pointed : WANTED : Young , skinny , wiry fellows , not over eighteen . Must be expert riders , willing to risk life daily . Orphans preferred . Interested persons should apply at the local Pony Express company . " Well ? " she shrugged . Then as she realized why he wanted her to see it she demanded , " Are you out of your mind , Tracy ? " The eagerness on Tracy 's freckled face faded . " Do n't even think about it ! " She held up a warning hand to ward off any further reckless enthusiasm . " Ah , Sunny- , " he protested . " No ! Do n't say a word ! I wo n't listen ! " His sister 's hazel eyes flashed . " You want to get killed before we even get to California ? " She moved away but he grabbed her arm . " Wait just a durn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You got a better idea ? " Feeling sick dismay sweep over her at his reminder of their predicament , Sunny spoke more sharply than she intended . " No , I do n't have a better idea at the moment , but I 'll think of something . " As an afterthought , she added , " And you watch your language , young man , you hear ? " She walked on . Then , realizing he was n't following , she stopped and looked back . Her brother was still standing there , hands thrust into his pockets , making a circle in the dusty street with the toe of his boot . " Come on , Tracy , " she called impatiently . For a long moment , Tracy remained staring at the poster . " Come on ! " she repeated with increasing irritability . Reluctantly and slowly her brother moved , mumbling under his breath . Sunny bit her lower lip in irritation . Were n't things bad enough without her having to deal with his childishness ? To make matters worse , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of money , stranded in a Missouri border town . Temporarily , at least . Surely when she found the sheriff of this town , explained what had happened ... How stupid she had been to trust that blackguard Colin Faraday . The whole sorry scene that had taken place on the train on their way here came back to Sunny in vivid detail . It had seemed such a good plan , a great adventure , when they had set out from their small Ohio Valley community . Filled with excitement and high hopes , they boarded the train to Independence , Missouri . Even the name was significant to them . It was the " jumping-off place " to the West . There they would join one of the many wagon trains heading to California , where they would homestead and make their fortune . Sunny remembered how optimistic they were but how hopelessly inexperienced in the ways of the world . On the train , they encountered an affable fellow traveler . Seated across the aisle from them , he introduced himself as Colin Faraday and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , asking them many questions about where they were from , where they were going . His pleasant personality , his jolly laugh , and his self-assured manner soon won their confidence . They found themselves telling him their plans , their hopes for the future . " Well now , if that ai n't the best kind of luck . A sure enough example of being in the right place at the right time-and being the right man ! " he said with a broad wink . " I do n't know how many times I been on this same train and met up with folks like you going west . I have great admiration for people with that kind of dreams " - he leaned closer- " and I 'm in the business of making them come true . Leastways , helpin ' make them come true . " He lowered his voice . " But you got ta be careful about gettin ' your wagon , your mules or oxen , your supplies . ... The merchants and storekeepers at these towns where the wagon trains set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like yourselves . Not that you ai n't got a good head on your shoulders , no siree bob . I seen that right away . You , young lady , and this here young man , I could tell you know where it 's at , but ... " He shook his head . " Heard some ad tales of folks bein ' - " a worried look crossed his face- " well , unless you know what you 're doin ' ... " At his words , Sunny suddenly felt the full weight of what they had done . Buoyed with enthusiasm , she had ignored all the warnings , relatives ' dire predictions of the hazards of the undertaking . It was she who had read the glowing Emigrants Handbook from cover to cover , committing to memory just what they would need to purchase to become part of one of the wagon trains going west . Her hands clutched her small purse , in which was most of the cash they had received from the sale of the house , the furniture , the cow , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left home that she felt she might have taken on more than she could handle . Now the fear that she might not be able to choose wisely , make good assessment of value on buying a wagon , trust the merchants to deal fairly , made her weak with apprehension . " Is n't there someone we could talk to , someone to consult ? " Sunny had asked Faraday in a faltering voice . " Yes , ma'am , there sure is ! " Mr. Faraday laughed heartily . He jabbed his thumb into his chest . " You 're looking right at him . " Faraday proceeded to tell them that he was willing to do for them what he 'd done for countless others starting out to the new part of the country . " More than willin ' , " he assured them . Then he explained how he could procure their " outfit " - wagon , mules , and other necessary equipment-for them and save them from being cheated by unscrupulous suppliers who fed off the ignorant . " That is very kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether we should impose on your goodwill . Wo n't that take a great deal of trouble and time for you ? From your own business in Fairfax City ? " Sunny was torn by her natural reluctance to rely on a stranger . However , the relief of turning over the responsibility to someone more knowledgeable than she to outfit them for the journey west was greater . " Well , ma'am , I took to you and this young fellow the minute I set eyes on you both . I sez to myself , sez I , now there 's a pair of fine , upstanding , ambitious young people ready to face the future and expand this great country of ours . It would be a pleasure-no , let 's say a downright honor-to assist such a couple . " ( Continues ... )
