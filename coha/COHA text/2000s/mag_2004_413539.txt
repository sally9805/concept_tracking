Today , it is a bloated spectre of its former self , a kind of riverine Jabba the Hut  --  only with immeasurable charm . Oh , it was a hellion once , one of North America 's more rambunctious streams . It took the Tennessee Valley Authority decades to bring it to heel , but they did with nine high-lift locks and dams . So , instead of a torrent , it is now a long series of tilted pools reaching from Knoxville to just above Paducah , Ky. , in a long , wrinkled U. And all for the better , you have to admit . As much as you mourn the passing of a feisty spirit , the flood control , the electricity generated and the leisure opportunities far outweigh that . We start out this fine summer day on Pickel Island near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray has its international headquarters . " We " being yours truly , skipper Edmond Randolph and his daughter , Natalie . Cynthia Trudell , Sea Ray 's affable president , has entrusted us with her company 's latest creation , a 42-foot pleasure palace , hull number one of the 420 Sedan Bridge . Shortly after leaving the dock , we come to the fork at Lebanon Church where the French Broad and the Holston conjoin to form the Tennessee . The sailing line from here to the Ohio River is 652 miles . Our goal : Chattanooga , some 188 miles ( and three locks and dams ) downstream  --  or across the long ponds , as the case may be . In Tennessee ( and elsewhere ) these are called lakes . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers calls them " pools . " Knoxville slides by as we duck under the highway and railroad bridges spanning the river . It is a pleasant , small city with a manageable downtown , a cute little historic district now chockablock with boutiques and cafs . We see the leafy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to football , Neyland Stadium , dominating all . The gentrified riverfront is now called Volunteer Landing , and you should see this stretch when the Vols play a home game . It 's a little hard to reconcile this sleepy , peaceful city with the seamy underbelly depicted in Cormac McCarthy 's darkly comic novel Suttree . The Tennessee Valley is hemmed in by the Great Smoky Mountains to the east , and the rumpled Cumberland Plateau to the west , which appears to us now as a dark smudge . In the Fort Loudon pool , we glide past limestone cliffs , flood plain cornfields and row after row of immense houses . At 4:45 p.m. , we pull into a cozy cove near Chota Bend and rendezvous with Edmond 's wife , Keli , and two of their friends , Dr. Susan Webb and her husband , Glen Zinc , and their Sea Ray 340 Sundancer , Sea Section . Need I tell you that Susan is an OB-GYN ? We will travel in tandem for the duration . Shortly therafter , we pass the Mount Vernon-esque mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Conspicuous consumption is alive and well . Not all of the local mansions are nouveau , however . The Georgian plantation manor built in the 18th century by Dr. Francis A. Ramsey is worth the visit . We pull into the Fort Loudon Marina , just shy of the first dam , to top off our tanks and make it into the lock at 6:35 . It is a deep , 72-foot drop into the Watts Bar pool . When we emerge , we are all soberly reminded that the old river can still get you . Two days before , two men drowned when their outboard motor failed and they were sucked into the turbulence below a spillway . If you make this trip , you 'll find that below the dams the river is a semblance of its former self , deep and swift . As it nears the next dam , it goes slack and sprawls into the foothills . Now we have to move , because darkness is overtaking us and we have a way to go to our stop for the night . The river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the channel markers , but not easily . We reach Watts Bar Dam at 10:00 . The locks are ablaze with light , but our destination is a cove on our right that is inky black with no lighted marks to guide us in . The Sea Ray Navigator chartplotter is one option you surely will want to take on this boat ( the bowthruster is another ) . Using it , abetted by the radar , Edmond guides us carefully into the " resort , " which consists of two new docks and little else , although they do have electric hookups . Tired , but happily so , we have a " wee dram " and head to bed . To my consternation , Edmond and Keli insist I take the master stateroom forward , while they share the guest quarters and Natalie sleeps on the couch in the salon . The next morning , I check out the boat while I have my tea . The bridge , the defining feature of this style of boat , is quite spacious . The command center you will recognize as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea Ray wanna-bes ) , with its burlwood dash and handsome and convenient instrument clusters . There is a companion seat to port , and a U-bench aft with a table . For the four of us , there is plenty of room to spread out . The cockpit is small but serviceable , with a bench seat across the transom and a gate to the wide swim platform . There are grand staircases to the sidedecks and a steep but manageable one to the bridge . Two settees face each other in the salon . An entertainment center is in the after starboard corner . The dinette sits high to port , giving diners a grand view through the generous windows and creating headroom for the guest stateroom below . Angled along the starboard bulkhead , the galley has an electric stove , coffeemaker , microwave , sink , a nice pantry and an upright fridge/freezer . The guest stateroom has fore and aft twins , but a filler converts them to a double . The guest head with shower is also the day head , and is a mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the molded-in sink is partially tucked under the cabinet , making it impossible to wash your face or brush your teeth without bumping your head and/or getting water all over the place . Rethink this one , guys . A pedestal double berth in the master stateroom has a nice ventilation/escape hatch overhead and good shelves along both sides . There are two cedar-lined lockers and a TV mounted in the bulkhead . It 's all very snug  --  and private . Here , and throughout the cabin , there is ample evidence of Sea Ray 's good taste in dcor , sensible use of stowage space and overall commitment to quality . By the time I finish my walk-through , the rest of the gang has returned from breakfast at a place on top of the hill . We wait for the mist to lift from the main channel before getting under way . We lock through into the Chickamauga pool at 11:30 a.m. and an hour later raft up for lunch . There is a lot of traffic on this hot summer weekend , including the occasional commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could put the Seventh Fleet in it . Well , almost . At 2:55 p.m. , we drop through the Chickamauga lock into the Nickajack pool , and at 3:30 we tie up to the transient docks at Chattanooga . Unfortunately , there is only a rudimentary marina here ( the city should do more to develop its riverfront ) . But , we have time to go ashore and walk about . The Tennessee Aquarium is right up the slope from our slip , and we make another important discovery : Do n't plan on seeing it on a hot Saturday afternoon . The whole city has turned out and we ca n't get tickets . Too bad , because I 've been through it , and it is a wonderful facility , devoted to the Tennessee River and other rivers around the world . Charming city Chattanooga is worthy of an extended stay . It is a charming city . Its location made it a transportation hub from the beginning of railroad service . Both the Confederacy and the Union recognized its importance early on and bloodily contested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mentioned , that the Tennessee begins its most tortuous quest for freedom . Poet , novelist and historian Donald Davidson wrote : " ... of all the great rivers east of the Mississippi , it has been least friendly to civilization . " The narrowness of the channel below the city , where Lookout Mountain peers across to Moccasin Bend , created vicious currents and whirlpools , given fanciful names like the Skillet and the Suck . We take advantage of Chattanooga 's many fine restaurants and have dinner ashore before beginning our ascent back to Knoxville , barely making it back into the Chickamauga lock ahead of a tow . After a night in a slip at Erwin Marine , including a waist-exploding dessert of Bananas Foster concocted by Susan and Glen , we set off mid-morning to retrace our steps . It is a long day of running , but cruising on the river is always pleasurable . You may see an osprey nest you missed , or notice an odd dwelling tucked into the forested slopes . I have never tired of cruising on the Tennessee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a behemoth is slumbering . Specifications : LOA ( w/swim platform ) Table <p>
