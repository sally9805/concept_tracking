London , 1815 <p> Stephen Rawlings Mallory , fifth Marquess of Silverton , felt a familiar sense of resignation and boredom creeping over him . Of course , no one observing him would have known that he was n't listening attentively to his uncle . Silverton had exquisite manners . He would never commit an act of rudeness unless the recipient of such an act deserved it . <p> " Are you listening to me , Silverton ? " snapped General Stanton . " Have you even heard a word I said ? " <p> " Of course I have , sir . You know how much I value your thoughts on this and any subject you may care to discuss . " <p> " Do n't try to pull the wool over on me , boy . I 'm not your aunt or your mother , and I know you bloody well do n't care what I have to say about you , " his uncle retorted . " You 're nothing but a popinjay who do n't give a damn about what he owes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young cousin , Robert Stanton , had been sitting quietly in the corner , displaying uncommon good sense in keeping his mouth shut during his grandfather 's tirade . But the unjust attack on his mentor and idol proved to be too much of a provocation for Robert , and Silverton could see he was about to come to his defense . He shook his head slightly , willing Robert to silence , but the young man either failed to see or to understand the small gesture . Silverton sighed inwardly , lamenting the fact that his cousin had neither the wit nor the sense of self-preservation to avoid bringing his grandfather 's wrath upon himself . <p> " No , really , sir , that 's just not fair . Stephen , a popinjay ! " exclaimed Robert . " You must know he is one of the best sportsmen in the country , not to mention having some of the finest horseflesh and hounds in all of England . Really , Grandfather , to compare him to a dandy is just too much ! " <p> The general 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bristling with irritation as he trapped his next victim in his sights . <p> " No , you young jackanapes ! That honor in the family belongs to you . Look at you . You can barely turn your head in that ridiculous neckwear . You look like a stork peering out of its nest . And all your poetic airs and lamentations ! It is enough to drive me to an early grave . No , you are indeed the dandy in the family , and just as useless when it comes to finding a wife and doing your duty to your name . " <p> Robert turned bright red , sputtering a confused defense that he was still too young to get married . He was easily cowed by his grandfather and particularly sensitive about both his appearance and his literary aspirations . The lad did not actually write any poetry but firmly believed that he only awaited the arrival of his muse to unleash what would undoubtedly be his artistic genius . In the meantime , he read Byron , spent an inordinate amount of time on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with several fashionable young men whose families the Stantons had known forever . <p> Silverton understood , however , that General Stanton would no longer tolerate this harmless but idle life . He deemed it time to intercede before the squabble developed into a full-out row . <p> " Now , Robert , " he interjected in a soothing voice . " Uncle would never call me a dandy , and I 'm sure he appreciates my horseflesh as much as the next person . But you ca n't blame him for wishing to see us settled , although I do agree you are a bit young to be pushed into the parson 's trap . " <p> " Not at all , " exclaimed the general . " I was only nineteen and your aunt only seventeen when we tied the knot . I 'm sure she has never had any cause for complaint since that day . " <p> " Perhaps we should ask her , " muttered Robert . <p> The general whipped his gaze back to his grandson . " What was that ? " he growled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be that as it may , God knows it 's not easy to find a woman with Aunt Georgina 's qualities . You must admit , sir , you were exceedingly lucky to snag such a prize so early in life . " <p> General Stanton grunted his reply , mollified as always by the thought of his wife . Silverton knew that in spite of the gruff response , his uncle was inordinately fond of Lady Stanton and cherished her in his own inarticulate manner . He also knew his uncle was dismayed that he and Robert did not seem the least bit interested in settling down and starting families of their own . <p> The three men sat in the library of General Stanton 's richly appointed townhouse in Berkeley Square , shortly before noon on a warm April morning . Silverton thought it much too early in the day to endure a dressing-down , but ignoring his uncle 's summons would only have postponed the inevitable . He was , after all , almost thirty-five , and it was indeed high time he took himself a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and aunt to drag him to Almack 's , and from one subscription ball to another , in the hopes of finding a woman whom he could imagine living with on a permanent basis . He had met many charming young ladies and enjoyed several delightful flirtations . But over time his willingness to be pleased had evaporated , replaced by a cynical amusement with the relentless machinations of the marriage mart . <p> The fault lay not with the numerous debutantes thrown his way , who were as trapped by the subtle yet unbending rules of the ton as he was . In fact , in his more generous moments he even felt sympathy for the girls whose parents drove them to hunt him like a prized stag . Mostly , though , he felt irritation and contempt , and not much else . <p> Silverton had come to the conclusion long ago that he was by nature a cold person or , at the very least , lacking in strong feelings . He enjoyed many things-his horses , his dogs , and his friends . He was fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could never seem to muster any real attraction toward the fluttering girls paraded before him and honestly had no desire to feel otherwise . <p> When he thought of marriage at all-which was n't often-it invariably left a dull , faintly sour taste in his mouth . But Silverton knew it was only a matter of time before he must resign himself to a suitable alliance . Duty required him to marry , and marry he would , but he had no expectations for his own happiness . <p> Silverton listened absently while his uncle berated Robert . Since it did n't really seem to matter whom he married , he had compiled a list of eligible candidates in his head to present to the general for discussion and approval . Now seemed as good a time as any to make the decision . <p> He was about to open his mouth when he heard a commotion out in the hallway and the raised voice of Tolliver , his uncle 's excruciatingly correct butler . The door to the library flew open and Tolliver exclaimed , " No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ! " <p> All three men turned their heads toward the door and were met with the astonishing sight of an unknown young woman striding into the room . When she found herself confronted by their shocked gazes , she stopped in her tracks . Tolliver followed closely behind and only just managed to avoid barreling into her . <p> Silverton rose slowly to his feet . Robert seemed paralyzed , but he finally remembered his manners and sprang to attention . For one long moment , they all remained trapped in a stunned silence before the general finally found his voice . <p> " Who the devil are you ? " <p> The intruder 's eyes quickly surveyed the room , skipping Robert and coming to rest on Silverton . Their gazes locked on each other . He felt as if he had been nailed to the floor , so captivated was he by the sight of the feminine whirlwind who had swept into their midst . <p> A tall , long-limbed creature , her shiny black hair curled out from under a sturdy country bonnet . Although she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confronting a roomful of strangers suggested she could be older . <p> But more than anything , her eyes captured him by surprise . They were extraordinary : large under straight , determined brows and framed by thick black lashes . It was their color , however , that had caught his attention so forcefully . They were gray , but not the insipid , neutral color one associated with the term . No , they reminded him of a winter rainstorm-turbulent , untamed , and full of secret depths . <p> He stared at her , dimly aware he was probably making an ass of himself , but it seemed impossible to look elsewhere . She , too , seemed unable to break away , her eyes widening as a faint flush bronzed her cheeks and the bridge of her nose . For just a second , he thought the darkness in her gaze transmuted into something lighter , a brief flash of silver in the deep . Silverton could not seem to assemble his thoughts into a coherent order , but it occurred to him that she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . <p> Then she blinked , the spell broke , and she turned to face his uncle . <p> " I am most sorry , General Stanton , " said Tolliver , who wrung his hands in distress over this astounding breach of etiquette . " I tried to tell this young ... woman that she could not disturb you , but she waited until my back was turned and then ... " <p> He trailed off into silence , too distraught to even finish his sentence . <p> The general impatiently waved his hand at the butler . " Yes , yes , well , you may go , Tolliver . I 'll deal with this situation . " <p> " Yes , sir . " The butler tottered out of the room , clearly shattered by the disturbance to his well-ordered household . <p> General Stanton focused his gaze on the young woman standing before him . <p> " Now , miss , " he said , " perhaps you will be so good as to explain your extraordinary behavior . " <p> Silverton again saw the faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was apparent by the way she held her ground that the general 's irascible demeanor failed to intimidate her . <p> " I am Meredith Burnley , sir , " she replied in a quiet voice . " My stepmother was your daughter , Elizabeth , and your granddaughter , Annabel , is my half sister . " <p> Another stunned silence fell over the library . If she had shot a cannonball through the room , the shock could not have been any greater . Silverton grimaced , bracing himself for the inevitable explosion as General Stanton confronted the stepdaughter of his bitterly estranged and long-dead child . <p> The old man was , indeed , turning an alarming shade of red as he rose from his chair to contend with this obviously unwelcome spectre from the past . In fact , he appeared on the verge of an apoplectic fit . Silverton cast about for a way to divert his uncle 's attention , but his mind at the moment felt approximately as agile as a snail crawling through two feet of mud . <p> " How ... how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to blurt out . " By God , woman , what right do you have to disturb my peace after your father ruined my daughter 's reputation and her life ? A tradesman 's son to marry my child ! Her mother and I have spent many years trying to forget our loss . And now , after all this time , you dare come here ... to my home ! " <p> The general shook with rage , his hands clenched into white-knuckled fists . " He ruined her life , I tell you , and it broke her mother 's heart ! " <p> For a few seconds , General Stanton glared at the silent young woman before turning his back on her . Miss Burnley staggered under the impact of the old man 's wrath , swaying a bit as if she might faint . Repressing a curse , Silverton moved quietly across the thick Aubusson carpet until he stood behind her . He could think of no other response to his uncle 's shocking outburst , but at least he could catch her if she swooned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I am here , sir , " she replied in an unexpectedly sharp voice , " because I have no choice . I wrote to you after our father died , hoping you would realize how much your granddaughter needed the protection of her family . You chose to ignore us , and she has been forced to submit to the direction and guardianship of a man who does not have her best interests at heart . I have imposed myself only to implore that you intervene on Annabel 's behalf to prevent a most unhappy fate from befalling her . " <p> Miss Burnley struggled to maintain her composure . She clamped her arms tightly against her sides , attempting to subdue the tremors shaking her body . Silverton felt an oddly powerful impulse to take her in his arms and soothe her . He fought the unfamiliar urge as the young woman deliberately straightened her spine and cocked her elegant chin . Instead of retreating , she stepped closer to the desk , leaned into it , and fixed her implacable gaze on his uncle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to me . If you do not , Annabel likely will not survive this threat to her wellbeing . She is very fragile . " <p> The general finally looked at her , hostility etched in every line of his face . <p> " You must help her , " she implored again . A note of faint panic seemed to thread her voice . " I would not have disturbed you if there had been any other way to save Annabel . I can not lose her . She is all I have . " <p> Her voice caught , and she fell silent . Miss Burnley clutched her reticule in a tight fist and turned away from the general as if embarrassed by her loss of control . She gasped when she discovered Silverton standing so closely behind her , taking a hasty step back to regain her balance . <p> Grasping her elbow , he gently steered her to one of the leather club chairs to the side of his uncle 's desk . " Miss Burnley , wo n't you sit down ? You may tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I insist you have some refreshment first . " <p> Silverton glanced at his cousin , who was glued to the spot , mouth hanging open and eyes popping from their sockets . " Robert , " he admonished , " do stop catching flies and ring the bell for some tea . " <p> The lad snapped his mouth shut and hurried over to yank vigorously on the bell cord . <p> Silverton returned his gaze to Miss Burnley , who sat bolt upright on the edge of her chair , eyes lowered as she grasped her handkerchief in a death grip . Taking a deep breath to steady herself , she looked up to meet his eyes . <p> " Thank you , sir . I should be most grateful for a cup of tea . " Her soft mouth trembled into a tentative smile . <p> He blinked as the force of that shy smile lanced through him . The unexpected jolt of emotion was both surprising and irritating . <p> General Stanton forcefully cleared his throat , jerking Silverton out of his momentary reverie . After briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mahogany sideboard holding a collection of decanters and crystal glassware . Silverton poured a small glass of sherry and returned to her side . <p> " Yes , tea will be just the thing , but I fancy you could use something a bit more fortifying while we wait . " <p> " No , I 'm fine , " she protested . " I do n't need that . " She took another deep breath , folding her hands carefully in her lap . <p> " Yes , you do , " he replied in a firm voice , willing her with his eyes to take the drink . " Come , Miss Burnley , I insist . " <p> She looked at him doubtfully . He nodded his encouragement , and she again offered him that painfully sweet and tentative smile . Miss Burnley took the glass and sipped , casting her gaze up as if seeking his approval . Silverton found himself riveted by the luscious tremor of her full pink lips and the burnished silver of her amazing eyes . <p> Under the circumstances , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head at the day 's unexpected turn of events . He had reluctantly dragged himself to Stanton House this morning to meet his uncle . Completely unawares , he had been pitched right into the middle of what his mother called the Great Family Scandal . No one spoke of the estrangement between the general and his daughter . It had always seemed like ancient history to Silverton , especially since Elizabeth Burnley had died so many years ago . But part of that ancient history had come back to life today , and with a vengeance . <p> He looked thoughtfully at the striking young woman perched on the edge of her seat , cautiously drinking her small glass of sherry . In spite of the obvious distress of all the parties in the library , Silverton had to admit this was much more fun than talking about his impending immolation on the matrimonial altar . <p> Especially when one of the parties involved was Miss Meredith Burnley . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
