Chapter One Fifty-Two Card Pick-Up I could smell the pound cake through my closed front door . Vanilla , sugar , butter-luscious scents mingling in a heavenly aroma that promised rapture . Of all things , why did it have to be pound cake-my sugar-addicted Achilles ' heel ? " Mrs. Johnston ? Ellie ? Are you in there ? " The nasal voice reminded me of Gladys Kravitz , the nosy neighbor on Bewitched . Unfortunately , I did n't possess Samantha 's supernatural powers to rid myself of this unwanted visitor . Which meant that the only way I was going to get the cake and/or make my neighbor go away was to open the door . Honestly , I 'd have had no dilemma at all if it were n't for the pound cake . For the past two weeks , I 'd been closeted in the house , safely hidden from the outside world . All I wanted was to lick my wounds , marinate in endless bubble baths of grief and regret , and eat whatever was handy . I had consumed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup . Krispy Kreme donuts . Butter pecan Haagen Daz . Betty Crocker brownie mix . No saturated fat or carbohydrate had escaped me , because for the first time in my adult life , I was eating whatever I wanted . Two weeks , though , of consuming my way through the kitchen hadyielded a predictable result . Like Old Mother Hubbard , my cupboard was now as bare as my bottom was wide . I wanted to be left alone to grow old and die in solitude , cut off from the outside world in this tumbledown 1920s Tudor , the symbol of my wretched post-divorce existence . I could keep drifting from room to room , looking glassy-eyed out the windows at my overgrown backyard with a cup of cold coffee in my hand . The drone of late-night infomercials would keep me company during the long , sleepless nights I spent flipping through photo albums of the life I had lost . I could depend on the stray tabby cat that pawed through my garbage can for my social interaction . But if I did n't replenish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and die much more quickly than I 'd planned . " I made pound cake . To welcome you to the neighborhood . " Her temptress 's voice , along with the scent of vanilla , slid through the cracks around the edge of the door . My new neighbor was scarily persistent . I had simply ignored her earlier visits , but now I did n't have the luxury . Who would ever have believed it would come to this ? Once , I 'd been Mrs. Eleanor Johnston , wife of a successful surgeon and pillar of the Junior League . Now I was nothing but another high-end Nashville divorcee who 'd been banished from her 37205 life by her husband 's wandering eye . I had become nothing but a cliche , and not a very interesting one at that . " I think you 'll feel better if you eat some of this , " the voice said through the door . God , but this woman was not going to give up , was she ? And she did have pound cake . My hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood stuck tight , and I had to give it a strong yank before it gave way , revealing the perky middle-aged woman standing on my front porch . " There you are . " The woman 's bright blond hair competed with her paper-white teeth for brilliance . With a start , I recognized her from her advertisements on bus stops all over town . She owned one of the big real estate firms and I had probably even met her at one fund-raiser or another , but I could n't remember her name . " I was beginning to worry about you . " Uninvited , she stepped across the threshold and into my inner sanctum with the same determination that must have gotten her to the top of the Nashville real estate market . I had the grace to blush at the state of the living room . Twinkie wrappers and empty Coke cans littered the scarred coffee table . The sagging couch that once had done duty in our bonus room-I 'd considered it fit only for small children and teenagers-was now the centerpiece of my living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a strong indication of the general condition of the house . " I knew you 'd open the door eventually , " the woman trilled as she brushed past me and headed toward the kitchen as unerringly as if she 'd traipsed through the house a million times before . " My pound cake never fails . " I stood rooted to the spot , mouth gaping for several long moments , before I realized I was supposed to follow her size-2 frame . By the time I caught up with her in the kitchen , she had placed the cake on my cutting board , unwrapped the cloth like a priest preparing the host for the congregation , and was using a lethal-looking knife to slice off a wedge of the promised ambrosia . " Got milk ? " she chirped . My mouth watered so heavily I had to swallow twice before I could form a reply . " Um , no . I 'm out . " " That 's okay . We can have coffee instead . " I paused and cleared my throat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her eyebrow arched . " You 've gone through it all , then ? " My stomach twisted . I feigned ignorance . And hauteur . " What do you mean , I 've gone through it all ? " Her laugh was like silverware clanking in a drawer . " Honey , I know how it goes when you 're newly on your own . Eating your way through the refrigerator is practically a rite of passage . " " I haven't- " A flush crept up my neck . " It 's nothing to be ashamed of , honey . " She placed a hunk of cake on a paper napkin from the stack on the counter and thrust it toward me . " And you look like you need this . " My hand froze , fingertips an eyelash away from the cake . For a moment , I saw myself through my nosy neighbor 's eyes . Greasy hair that had n't seen shampoo in a week . Dressed in my son 's cast-off sweat pants and a paint-stained Vanderbilt sweatshirt . Had I even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was two parts humor and ten parts shame , I ran a hand over my hair to smooth down the inevitable bed head . " I do n't really ... That is , I 'm sure ... " The other woman smiled , this time with no condescension at all . " It 's okay , honey . We 've all been there . " That got my back up . Because , pardon me , not everyone had been where I was now . Not everyone was eating off Chinet while a DD-cup tramp ate off her Haviland china and drank from her Waterford crystal . " I do n't know what you mean . " Indignation kept me from reaching for the cake . " It 's no secret , sugar . News travels fast on the Woodlawn Avenue grapevine . We 're practically psychic . " Years of good Southern upbringing kept me from making a sharp retort . I did n't need the final humiliation of a public airing of my dirty laundry in my new neighborhood . Was n't it enough that I could never hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost everything . My husband . My beautiful home . My place in society . And now I was nothing more than fodder for gossip over the backyard fences of Woodlawn Avenue ? My neighbor remained undaunted by my silence . " I 'm Jane , by the way . Jane Mansfield . " She laughed , showing off her blinding teeth again . " I know , I know . But you ca n't pick the last name of the man you fall in love with . Or out of love with , for that matter . " Jane Mansfield . Now I remembered . Her publicity photo on the bus stop ads showed her dressed in fifties attire with a matching bouffant hairdo . She was ten years or so older than me , but at the moment , she looked a decade younger . She probably felt that way , too . Because right then , I must have looked at least a hundred and five . " It 's my birthday , " I said , the words falling from my lips of their own volition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every woman deserves a cake on her birthday . " I nodded , my throat too tight for speech . When was the last time I 'd had a birthday cake I had n't made with my own two hands ? Jim had been good with presents but bad with remembering to order something from Becker 's Bakery , and none of my children had inherited my homemaking gene . As I 'd learned over the years , there was something inherently sad about providing one 's own cake . " I 'm Ellie , " I finally rallied enough to blurt out . " Ellie Johnston . I mean , Hall . Ellie Hall . " Another change that was going to take some adjustment . One of Jane 's perfectly waxed eyebrows arched . " It 's final , then , your divorce ? " A lump formed in my throat . " I signed the papers yesterday . " " Hell of a birthday present . " I did n't know whether to laugh or cry at the irony of it all . " Yes . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane stood up straight , all ninety-eight or so pounds of her . " So today 's the day you start over . New house , new life , new you . " That point of view had never occurred to me . I 'd been so focused on what was coming to an end , I had n't given much thought to what might be beginning . The very idea made me queasy , so I took a bite of pound cake . A profusion of flavor exploded on my tongue . " Oh my God , " I moaned through the ecstasy melting in my mouth . " I ca n't believe this cake . " Jane smiled . " Well , there 's more where that came from . " She reached down and sliced off another piece . " So , Ellie Hall , do you have plans for your birthday ? " I sighed and leaned against the counter . " No . Not really . Since it 's Saturday , Oprah and Dr. Phil wo n't be expecting me . " " Good . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crumbs from the counter into her hand . As casually as if it were her house instead of mine , she opened the cabinet door under the sink and tossed them into the waiting trash can . " We 've been waiting for a fourth . " " A fourth ? A fourth of what ? " " A fourth for our bridge club . " " Oh . I 'm sorry , but I do n't play bridge . " Jane smiled . " That 's okay , honey . I did n't play either when I moved into my house . But I learned . " The woman might bake heavenly pound cake , but she was clearly a bit loopy . " I 'm sorry , but what does your house have to do with a bridge club ? " " Follow me . " Jane stepped around me and led me back through my dining room to the archway that separated it from the living room . The heart-shaped arch had mocked me from the moment my realtor had first shown me the house . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentrifying neighborhood south of Vanderbilt University that I could afford . It was as close to Belle Meade as my budget would allow . In time , I could channel my inner Martha Stewart to drywall the offending arch into another shape . A dagger , perhaps , for sticking through Jim 's faithless heart . Jane ran her hand over the curve in the plaster , caressing it . " Did n't you wonder about this when you bought the house ? " I shrugged , not wanting to reveal the depths of my pain or my sensitivity about the arch . " It 's important for some reason ? " " All four houses have them . One for each suit . " " All four houses ? " " Built by the original members of the club . " " Someone built houses based on a club ? " " Not just any club . Their bridge club . The Queens of Woodlawn Avenue . " That drew a rare chuckle from me . " Queens of Woodlawn Avenue ? You 've got to be kidding . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen of Diamonds . Grace on the other side of you is the Queen of Spades . And Linda , in the Cape Cod on the other side of me , she 's the Queen of Clubs . We each have the dining room arch for our suit . " Okay , her pound cake was sinfully good , but this woman was starting to frighten me a little . " Look , I appreciate the invitation , but really , I do n't think I 'd make very good company right now . " Not to mention my complete ineptitude with card games of any variety . While some of my sorority sisters in college had been bitten by the bridge bug , I 'd declined to be infected . Jane waved away my words with a flick of her expensive manicure . " You 'll learn . We all did . " She stepped back into the living room and I followed like an obedient puppy . " In fact , I think we should meet tonight . You need backup on your birthday . " " Look- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't this woman see that I just wanted to be left alone ? " Seven o'clock at my house , " she said over her shoulder as she tugged open the obstinate front door . " And wear a red hat . " " Wear a what ? " " A red hat . " I sagged against the arm of the sofa . " I 'm not sure I own a hat , much less a red one . " Jane smiled , again blinding me . " Then you can borrow one of mine . We never play bridge without our hats . Chapter rules . " Chapter rules ? Great . Not only had my husband thrown me over for a Hooters waitress , but I had spent all the money from my divorce settlement on a house in a neighborhood of crazies . " Bring a dish , too . That 's another rule . " " A dish of what ? " " Hors d'oeuvres . Casserole . Dessert . Whatever you feel like . " " But I do n't have anything in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you 'd better run to the grocery store . " Her eyes traveled over my sweatshirt and sweatpants . " You might want to change first . In this town , you 're going to see someone who will report back to him . " " Report back ? " " To your ex . He 'll hear about your every move . So you can decide what kind of report he 's going to get . Would you rather be the spurned woman in scruffy sweats or the fabulous divorcee who embraced life and moved on ? " Truthfully , I 'd rather be able to dial the clock back nine months so that none of this had ever happened . But she did have a point . Jim was bound to hear about it if I schlepped to the grocery store in our son 's castoffs . When it came to demographics , Nashville might be a major metropolitan area , but in all the ways that mattered , it was still a small town . I 'd learned never to say anything bad about anyone , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were speaking to was somehow related to the person you were disparaging . " Seven o'clock ? " I said weakly , and Jane beamed . " Good girl . You 're going to be okay . " I wanted to believe her , but reason and hard truth were not on her side . I was a fifty-year-old broke divorcee , living in a run-down , eighty-year-old house and wondering how I was going to pay next month 's electric bill . But even at my lowest , I still had my pride . It was about all I had , but for the time being , it was going to have to be enough . Jane waved good-bye and disappeared through the front door , leaving me alone with the pound cake . I straightened my spine , walked to the coffee table , and scooped up the Twinkie wrappers and Coke cans . Whether I wanted it or not , two things were apparently going to happen . With or without Jim , life was going to go on . And much to my consternation , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )
