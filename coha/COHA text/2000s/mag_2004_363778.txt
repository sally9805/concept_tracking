This much is true : In the 1950s , scientists from Sweden 's Home Research Institute mapped the movements of housewives in their kitchens with the aim of redesigning their work space to be more efficient . <P> This much is untrue : the scientists extended their studies to Norwegian bachelor farmers , who basically used their kitchens to make endless cups of coffee . <P> This much is wonderful : Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer 's Kitchen Stories , in which he imagines an observer named Folke ( Tomas Norstrom ) perched in a sort of tennis umpire 's chair , watching an old man named Isak ( Joachim Calmeyer ) doing his modest culinary chores . They 're not allowed to talk ; it would ruin the experiment 's purity . But , of course , they do , these two lonesome men leading minimalist lives in the snow-shrouded countryside . <P> The most explosive action in the film  --  its equivalent of a car chase  --  comes when Folke moves a salt cellar and Isak has trouble finding it . Yet Hamer reveals a surprising richness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his neighbor , his only friend , grows increasingly jealous of Folke 's presence . As for Folke , living in a cramped trailer parked outside , wearing a suit and tie in his observer 's chair , his life is constrained . As far as we know , his only human contact is an aunt who sends him food parcels . <P> But human need , unsentimentally stated ( and lubricated by alcohol ) , will out . They talk , they shyly share , they confront mortality . Most of all , they assert their humanity , which turns out to be far larger than we ( or perhaps they ) ever imagined it might be . <P> And Hamer reveals himself to be the most delicate of ironists , underplaying a sweet and most unusual love story . In Kitchen Stories a doctor , examining a patient , serenely smokes a cigarette with no comment made about the matter . There are dozens of similar moments in the film , and what a pleasure it is not to be hectored by a director as we laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  By Richard Schickel
