Former Symbionese Liberation Army leaders Bill and Emily Harris , along with two others , were charged last week with the murder of a customer during a 1975 bank robbery . But when they were caught and arraigned that year , it was their old comrade PATRICIA HEARST who made TIME 's cover . <P> Patty had changed during her hegira . Not only had her long dark blonde hair been cut shorter and dyed red but she had lost her healthy , cover-girl looks . Her face was noticeably drawn . But she did not look or act like a victim who had been forced by her abductors to rob a bank and denounce her grieving parents and her fiance as " pigs " and " clowns . " She was as casual as if she had dropped by to answer a traffic summons . She was wearing stained rubber clogs and dark brown cotton pants , and beneath her striped , long-sleeved jersey she was braless ... Next , Patty 's friends Bill and Emily Harris went before Judge Woodruff . As Harris entered the courtroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you say , comrades ? Keep on trucking ! " Then he lifted his left hand in a clenched-fist salute . The Harrises were arraigned on charges of illegal possession of arms ; bail was set at $550,000 for each . As he was led from the courtroom by two U.S. marshals , Harris raised his right arm , his fist a hard ball , and announced loudly , " This ai n't no big deal , comrades . Long live the guerrillas ! " <P>  --  TIME , Sept. 29 , 1975
