The Carthaginian and Roman commanders both had a solid string of victories to their credit when they met in 202 BC . Only one of them would emerge victorious this time . // In the fall of 202 BC , two mighty armies and two hithertoundefeated generals squared off for one of history 's most critical battles . At stake was world dominion for the Romans and survival as a sovereign power for the once-powerful Carthaginians . Seldom in the annals of warfare have two such great captains fought against one another as the two who clashed at Zama . Since the Second Punic War had begun in 219 BC , Hannibal Barca had inflicted three of the gravest defeats ever suffered by the Roman republic-at the Trebia River in December 218 , at Lake Trasimene in April 217 , and at Can nae on August 2 , 216 . Astonishingly , since his surprise crossing of the Alps in October 218 , Hannibal held together a polyglot mercenary army for almost 16 years in Italyduring which time he had defeated one Roman commander after another . Romans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals admired his military genius . Among them was the Roman who faced him at Zama . Publius Cornelius Scipio had fought his first campaigns as a junior officer and tribune at the Trebia and Can nae . In 210 BC Scipio was named commander in Spain , where his father and uncle had been defeated and slain the year before . Based on the lessons he had learned from studying how Hannibal conducted his battles and campaigns , Scipio retrained his army and introduced new , more flexible tactics . His efforts were rewarded with decisive victories against Hannibal 's formidable younger brother , Hasdrubal Barca , at the battles of Baecula in 208 and Ilipa in 207 , which drove the Carthaginians from Spain by 206 . Even then , Scipio had been planning to strike the Carthaginian empire on its home ground in North Africa and had begun trying to charm the various princes of Numidia ( modem Algeria and western Tunisia ) to support his endeavor . But jealous political opponents strove to prevent him from launching his invasion . Quinctus Fabius Maximus had cemented his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delaying tactics . After more than a decade of avoiding direct battle with Hannibal while denying him sufficient strategic headway to force Rome to surrender , Fabius saw his achievements threatened by Scipio 's plan . Fabius reminded all who would listen of the fate of Marcus Atilius Regulus , the Roman consul whose African invasion during the First Punic War had ended in disaster in 255 BC . In spite of that opposition , Scipio parlayed the immense popularity his victories in Spain had generated into election as consul in 205 . As consul , he would be one of Rome 's two supreme magistrates and military commanders . Out of spite , however , Fabius saw to it that Scipio 's army would be formed from Legions V and VI , which had disgraced themselves at Can nae . Those troops had been sent to Sicily and forbidden to return to Italy for the duration of the war . Scipio 's call for volunteers to strengthen his army brought in 7,000 veterans , and he found those of Legions V and VI to be experienced soldiers , eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were , however , old men with little experience in set-piece battles after more than a decade of garrison duty in Sicily . joining his volunteers with those troops , Scipio brought the strength of each legion to 6,200 foot soldiers , which were complemented by an equal number of Italian allies . His cavalry included about 300 Roman and 900 Italian horse soldiers per legion . Scipio spent the entire year of his consulship drilling his army . He also stayed in contact with the Numidian lords , whose cavalry support he regarded as vital to the success of his enterprise . Scipio placed his greatest hopes on his alliance with Syphax , king of the Masaesyles , or Western Numidians . Hedging his bets , Scipio had also sought the alliance of the young Masinissa , son of King Gaia of the Massyles , or Eastern Numidians. // An anonymous student of the Roman school of Guilio Romano painted this somewhat fanciful depiction of the 202 BC Battle of Zama in 1521 . Carthaginian General Hannibal Barca opened the battle with a charge by his skin7lish line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others received little support ( Giraudon/Art Resource , New York ) . // In 204 Scipio , with his command extended after being elected proconsul , prepared to embark on his great invasion . Forty war galleys were underway to escort his fleet of more than 400 transports . On board were 25,000 infantry and 2,500 cavalry . Only a message from King Syphax marred the nearly perfect preparations . Syphax had fallen madly in love with a Carthaginian noblewoman , Sophonisba , the daughter of General Hasdrubal Gisgo . Exerting her charms , Sophonisba convinced the barbarian lord to forsake Scipio and the Romans and return his allegiance to her home city , Carthage . Nonplused , Scipio continued with his invasion plans . While Scipio headed for Africa , Hannibal brooded in Bruttium . Victory had once seemed within his grasp in 216 , when he shat@ tered eight legions at Can nae . Much of southern Italy had rallied to the Carthaginian cause , and Carthage had promised to send him reinforcements from Spain and Africa . Roman consuls could not defeat Hannibal , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain and Sardinia the following year broke the momentum of victory Hannibal had generated . In Italy , the Romans persisted in their Fabian tactics-delaying and harassing-and gradually wore down Hannibal 's army . Reinforcements finally arrived in 207 , when Hannibal 's brother Hasdrubal Barca crossed the Alps . But that invasion ended in disaster at the Metaurus River , where Hasdrubal was slain and his army destroyed . // An anonymous student of the Roman school of Guilio Romano painted this somewhat fanciful depiction of the 202 BC Battle of Zama in 1521 . Carthaginian General Hannibal Barca opened the battle with a charge by his skin7lish line of elephants , but some of the big beasts stormed off , and others received little support ( Giraudon/Art Resource , New York ) . // So Hannibal maintained his diminishing army in Bruttium . Roman consuls who sought to oust the wily Carthaginian from his base were consistently defeated , but Hannibal lacked the resources to resume the offensive . One faint hope remained , as Hannibal 's youngest brother , Mago , invaded Liguria in 205 after being expelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18,000 foot , 2,800 horse and 7 elephants , Mago spent the next two years recruiting and drilling Ligurian and Celtic warriors , planning to invade Italy as his brothers had before him . Scipio crossed over to Africa in the summer of 204 without incident , landing near Cape Bon . The Punic navy was not a great threat at that time , and his greatest worry was the loss of Syphax 's support . Scipio was heartened when he was met in Africa by Masinissa , with 200 crack horsemen , but that was the full extent of Masinissa 's following . King Gaia had died , and Masinissa had become involved in a hard-fought war of succession . Syphax had intervened at the crucial moment , adding the Massyles kingdom to his own and driving Masinissa out as a mere renegade . Nevertheless , Scipio saw great opportunities in Masinissa 's friendship and for the moment was glad to have a local guide and scout . Masinissa soon proved his worth . Upon hearing of the Roman landing , Carthage had sent out General Hanno with a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totaling 4,000 horsemen . Masinissa made contact with Hanno 's force , then fled . The Carthaginians pursued him and were caught completely by surprise when Scipio 's 2,500 cavalry assailed their flank . Hanno and more than 1,000 of his men were slain in the first clash , and another 2,000 were killed or captured in the pursuit that followed . Scipio had secured his beachhead . He next moved to besiege the port of Utica , unmolested by Carthaginian forces . Utica proved a tougher nut to crack than Scipio had anticipated . After a siege of 40 days , the city still held firm . Meanwhile , Hasdrubal Gisgo had called out the civic levy and organized a large army , supposedly of 30,000 foot and 3,000 horse . He also summoned King Syphax , who arrived with a reputed host of 50,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry . Realistically , the two armies ; combined probably numbered no more than 30,000 infantry and 5,000 or 6,000 cavalry . Scipio judged he would be unable to face this force in open battle due to his inferiority in cavalry strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply lifted the siege of Utica and fell back on the Castra Cornelia , a fortified base camp his troops had built at the tip of a narrow promontory . Given Roman naval superiority@ his army would not want for supplies . Scipio could afford to wait out the winter until a more propitious opportunity arose . Hasdrubal and Syphax were content to set up camp and keep watch over the Romans . Overconfident because of their numbers , they opened negotiations with the Roman general . Scipio , with no real intent to negotiate seriously , played along in order to collect intelligence on the enemy camps . His diplomats , accompanied by senior centurions disguised as servants , brought him word that the Punic camps were highly vulnerable to flame . Scipio strung out the negotiations into the early spring of 203 , but when he judged his forces were ready he broke off the peace talks , though he still held out the hope they would resume shortly . The Carthaginian leaders , lulled into a false sense of security , suspected nothing until Scipio struck . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the two armies were annihilated , with practicalty no toss to the Romans . Scipio scored another victory in Rome , where his supporters succeeded in extending his proconsulship in Africa for the duration of the war . In Carthage , calls were now heard to recall Hannibal or sue for peace . In spite of his defeat , however , Hasdrubal Gisgo was not about to give up . Besides calling up new levies from Carthage and the nearby countryside , he sent out recruiting officers to Spain , where 4,000 crack Celt-Iberian mercenaries were hired . The appearance of the Celt-Iberian mercenary corps , as well as the entreaties of his young wife , Sophonisba , convinced Syphax to join Hasdrubal 's new army . Hasdrubal and Syphax assembled an army of some 25,000 foot and 3,000 horse in the Great Plains of the Bagradas River in the early summer of 203 . The instant Scipio heard of the new army from his scouts , he marched to attack , foreseeing that the Carthaginian force would only grow stronger with time . His expeditionary army of 27,500 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry . Hasdrubal Gisgo , though not yet fully prepared , accepted the challenge of battle . Scipio employed novel tactics to envelop and crush the Punic army . His cavalry first routed their opposition . Scipio 's three lines of infantry deployed in the customary checkerboard formation . The hastati ( first-line heavy infantry ) advanced into the fray as usual , but then the principes ( second line ) and tri/r/i ( reserve vet , erans ) , instead of following in support , marched out to the flanks to extend the line . The Punic infantry was enveloped and soon collapsed . Only the Celt-Iberians fought on . A thousand miles from home , with no expectation of mercy from the Romans , these hardened mercenaries fought to the last man , allowing Hasdrubal and Syphax to escape with a few of their followers . // A Flemish tapestry depicts the conference that Publius Cornelius Scipio ( at left ) and Hannibal Barca allegedly had just before the Battle of Zama . The negotiations came to nothing , but the two great captains may have simply wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scipio dispatched all his cavalry and light infantry , bolstered with some legionaries , under Masinissa and his friend Caius Laelius , to pursue Syphax and reclaim Masinissa 's kingdom . Scipio himself advanced with the heavy Roman infantry to Tunis , only 15 miles from Carthage . He hoped to overawe the city , which had no defending army in the field . In Carthage 's elected oligarchy of ruling aristocrats , calls for surrender were shouted down . Carthage was perhaps the most strongly fortified post in the world , and Scipio 's fleet was too small to threaten its communications . Two defensive measures were agreed upon . First , messengers were dispatched to recall the armies of Hannibal and Mago from Italy . At the same time , the Punic home fleet sailed to make a surprise raid on the Roman navy at Castra Cornelia . When word was brought to Scipio that the Carthaginian navy had been spotted sailing north , he was greatly concerned . Hastening back to Castra Cornelia , be found his fleet unprepared for an engagement and quite vulnerable . He ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering the bay where his fleet was anchored . When the Punic fleet arrived , it assaulted the barrier **28;55;TOOLONG and towing off 60 Roman merchant ships , but the Carthaginians failed to destroy the Roman navy . Meanwhile , Laelius and Masinissa pressed their pursuit of Syphax . Masinissa first reclaimed his father 's Massyles kingdom and then continued the chase into Syphax 's Masaesyles lands . Sometime in the fall of 203 , Syphax made a stand before his capital at Cirta . Masinissa began the battle with a tremendous cavalry charge but was countered by the horsemen of Syphax . When Laelius moved up with the Roman infantry , however , Syphax 's army was routed . While King Syphax was desperately trying to rally his men , his horse was wounded and he was thrown and captured . Laelius allowed Masinissa to ride on to Cirta with Syphax in chains before him . The Masaesyles were so overcome with grief and fear at the sight of their fallen king that the city fell without a struggle . The Roman victory was nearly undone , however , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Masinissa 's feet , pleading for protection from the wrath of the Romans . Masinissa was overcome with passion for the young woman and impulsively pledged to protect her . On the following day , Masinissa arranged a marriage ceremony with her , hoping Scipio would not order the surrender of his new bride . When Scipio heard of these events he was not amused . His former alliance with Syphax had been sundered by this woman , and now she had captured the heart of Masinissa . Scipio rebuked the young prince and sternly informed him that even if she was not Hasdrubal 's daughter , his Carthaginian bride was technically a prisoner of war . Masinissa saw only one way to honor his pledge never to allow Sophonisha to fall into the hands of the Romans : He sent a slave to her with a cup of poison , which she drank without any hesitation . To take Masinissa 's mind off this tragic turn of events , Scipio had him declared a king and sent him off to complete the conquest of Numidia . The defeat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictated terms that included the withdrawal of Carthage 's armies from Italy and Liguria , the permanent cession of Spain and all the islands , the surrender of the Punic navy and a large tribute . The Carthaginian council accepted the terms , and Scipio granted an armistice in Africa while the treaty was put before the Senate in Rome . During the summer of 203 , while Hannibal continued to hold his own in Bruttium , his brother Mago finally launched his invasion of Italy . Mago had reinforced his 20,800-man expeditionary force with as many as 15,000 Ligurian and Celtic warriors , and the Carthaginian army advanced into the Po River valley . Two Roman armies with four full legions and allies , numbering 36,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry , were deployed to meet them . Mago used his war elephants to rout the Roman cavalry , but his Ligurian and Celtic levies did not hold up against the legions . The armies fought to a bloody stalemate . Then Mago was wounded and the Carthaginian army grudgingly retired from the field , conceding the victory to Rome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain , while Rome lost 2,300 killed . Withdrawing into Liguria , Mago reached the Gulf of Genoa and found envoys from Carthage waiting with orders to embark his army at once and return to Africa . Another delegation was delivering the same message to Hannibal . Mago signed on as many Ligurian and Celtic mercenaries as he could and set sail as ordered . Hannibal , likewise submitting to the inevitable , embarked his army . Neither commander could bring many horses , since there were not enough transports . Strangely , the Roman navy did not interfere with the movement of either army , En route to Africa , Mago died of his wound . He would be sorely missed at Zama . By then , Rome had ratified the peace terms dictated by Scipio . The Senate dispatched envoys to Africa to see to the execution of the agreement . A Roman supply convoy was scattered by a storm , however , and many of the merchant ships ran aground within sight of Carthage . An angry mob convinced the council to dispatch the Punic navy to seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty , but the Carthaginians were confident because Hannibal had returned . // An admirer of Hannibal , Scipio had studied his tactics . He used that knowledge against the Carthaginian at Zama-and eventual succeeded in encircling his force , just as Hannibal had done at Can nae // Hannibal arrived near Hadrumetum ( modem Sousse ) , about 50 miles south of Carthage , in the spring of 202 . He wanted to avoid the political infighting and mob scenes at Carthage , so he kept his distance . He had to manage not one army , but three . Few of the troops who had crossed the Alps with him 16 years earlier remained , but the 14,000 soldiers he led-mostly Bruttian , with Carthaginian officers and Libyan and Iberian subalterns-were among the finest in the world . The second army was Mago 's force , about 12,000 hardened Ligurian , Celtic and Balearic mercenaries . The third army was composed of raw recruits . A draft of the civic levy had produced about 14,000 foot and a little more than 1,000 horse . Months of drill were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scipio 's legionaries , but they would be fighting for their homes and families . Hannibal sent out hunters to capture elephants and dispatched messengers into the western desert to rally Syphax 's kinsmen , with their Numidian horsemen , to his army . // Far left : A bust of Scipio Africanus , who acquired the honorary sobriquet after his brilliant North African campaign . Left : Although Carthaginian coins depict Hannibal as a cleanshaven Semite , a Roman sculptor gave the commander a beard . // Scipio wanted to respond to Hannibal 's landing but could not . Masinissa was far off in the West , and Scipio dared not approach Hannibal without his horsemen . Messenger after messenger was sent off urging Masinissa 's immediate return with the largest possible body of horsemen . Both Scipio and Hannibal spent an anxious summer anticipating the arrival of their Numidian support . But it was Tychaeus , a relative of Sy ax , who responded first , arriving at Hannibal 's camp in the early fall with 2,000 light cavalry , reputedly the finest horesement in all the of Numidia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also on his way . Scipio now took his army out on a pillaging expedition , raiding and looting the rich valley of the Bagradas River . Scipio was moving away from Carthage , and away fro Hannibal . The council of Carthage , seeing their estates laid waste , ordered Hannibal to pursue . The general replied that he would move in his own good time . Nevertheless , Hannibal brought his army out of camp and marched to intercept Scipio . The estates meant nothing to Hannibal , but Scipio was marching to meet Masinissa , and Hannibal hoped to catch the Roman first . Hannibal cought up with Scipio near Zama ( probably modern Seba Bair ) and encamped . Soon afterward , the Romans captured some of Hannibal 's scouts . Scipio merely game them a tour of his camp near Naraggara ( modern Sidi Youssef ) and released them . They brought back information that Hannibal dreaded to hear . Masinissa had just arrived with 6,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry . Hannibal , now inferior in his mounted arm , would have to fight here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about four miles from the Romans . Legend has it that before their final battle , Hannibal and Scipio had a conference . Nothing was resolved , of course , and most likely these two great captains simply wished to meet face to face . The two commanders had a chat , then returned to their camps to prepare their armies for battle . Hannibal had as many as 40,000 infantry but only 3,000 cavalry . He also had 80 war elephants , the largest such force he had ever commanded and the largest raised during the Second Punic War . Scipio had just over 30,000 foot but 6,500 horse . Both generals deployed three lines of infantry , with cavalry on the flanks . Hannibal placed his 80 elephants in a skirmish line before his army . It was an imposing force , if only partially trained . His first line was composed of Magos 12,000 mercenaries . The second line included the 14,000 recruits from Carthage and the surrounding country . In the third echelon , Hannibal kept his 14,000-strong Old Guard . He posted his 1,000 civic cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held by Tychaeus with his 2,000 Numidian horse . Scipio formed the 25,000 heavy infantry of his legions in the usual three lines of hostati , principes and t7imii . Instead of the customary checkerboard formation , however , he placed the maniples of pincipes and triarii directly behind the hastati . By using this formation Scipio hoped to neutralize the shock of Hannibal 's charging elephants by allowing them to pass through these lanes in his army . Scipio also placed his velites , or skirmishers , to cover these lanes and harass the great beasts with missile fire . The general placed his 2,500 Roman and Italian cavalry under Laelius on his left , while Masinissa held the right with his 10,000 men . // Gauls and Ligurians of Hannibal 's first line fa back before the better armed and disciplined hastati . Hannibal ordered the troops of his civic phalanx to level their spears , forcing the mercenaries to flee to his flanks , without disrupting his formation . He then sent his second line forward . // The Battle of Zama commenced when Hannibal ordered his elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpeters give a great blast to startle the elephants , some of which stormed off , even charging into their own cavalry on the left wing . Masinissa seized the opportunity to attack Tychaeus ' disorganized force , quickly driving it from the field . Laelius likewise charged and routed the Carthaginian heavy cavalry . The Roman horse galloped off the field in hot pursuit . Some historians believe the swift retreat of his cavalry was a preconceived maneuver on Hannibal 's part to draw the superior Roman cavalry away from the field . If so , it was a brilliant stratagem that nearly succeeded . Not all the elephants were unnerved by the trumpet blast , and those still under control now lumbered into Scipio 's legions . While most of the pachyderms passed harmlessly through the lanes in the Roman army , a number managed to do their devilish work , goring with their tusks and crushing with their feet , while their crews launched arrows and javelins down on the foe . Although they wrought substantial havoc , the valiant beasts were unsupported and finally driven off or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now advanced and was met by Mago 's mercenaries . These barbarians , though more lightly armored than their opponents , attacked with savage fun , but once their initial charge was broken , the Romans steadily ground them down . After a bitter struggle , Hannibal 's first line began to crumble . The surviving Gauls and Ligurians fell back on the second echelon , but Hannibal ordered his citizen phalanx to level their spears to prevent the mercenaries from entering and disrupting the formation . Most of the barbarians fled to the flanks . A few , enraged by this apparent betrayal , attacked their own second line . They were quickly cut down . Now the hastati , weary but still in good order , engaged Hannibal 's second line , the civic phalanx . A desperate fight followed , and Scipio , by then anxiously anticipating the return of Laelius and Masinissa , was forced to commit his second line , the principes , to the struggle . After a prolonged bloody fight , Hannibal 's second echelon crumbled as well . The survivors fled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to avoid any entanglement with the routed forces . There was still no sign of the missing Roman cavalry . Hannibal now ordered his fresh reserve , the Old Guard , into action . Scipio also committed his third echelon , the Diar/i , but not in support of the hastati and principes . Instead , he reorganized his force . The principes and trii marched out to the flanks to extend the Roman line . Scipio 's army was now longer , but it was thinner than Hannibal 's force . The Carthaginians advanced inexorably and crashed into Scipio 's tired men . A fierce struggle ensued , and the Carthaginian veterans began to drive into the Roman center . Scipio feared that if his cavalry did not return in a few minutes , the battle might well be lost . Hannibal , by the same reasoning , urged his men forward into the attack while victory was possibly within their grasp . At that critical juncture , a cloud of dust was spied on the horizon . Laelius and Masinissa had returned , and their cavalry hurtled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scipio had snatched a victory at the last possible moment . Hannibal 's army was encircled and his troops slaughtered . Reportedly 20,000 Carthaginians were slain , and nearly as many were captured . Roman losses were 1,500 killed , and no doubt many thousands more wounded . Hannibal escaped with only a few horsemen . Scipio , who had studied Hannibal with awed admiration , had achieved an envelopment strikingly similar to that achieved by the Carthaginian general at Can nae 14 years earlier . At Zama two of the greatest generals of all time had met in a great battle . Both entered the battle undefeated-only one emerged so . Scipio earned the honorific title " Africanus " for his great victory . The Roman general dictated a peace treaty that was only slightly more severe than the one he had offered earlier . On Hannibal 's advice , the council in Carthage accepted the terms , and the Second Punic War finally came to an end . Both of those great generals were doomed to die in exile .

In 190 his brother Lucius won the consulship , and Scipio Africanus accompanied the army into Asia against King Antiochus Ill ( the Great ) , who was being advised by Hannibal . Lucius won a great victory at Magnesia in 189 . Soon thereafter , however , rival politicians began a smear campaign in the Senate and the courts that ultimately drove Scipio into self-imposed exile .

Rome had sent an expedition to Africa once before , during the First Punic War . Its commander had been the proconsul Marcus Atilius Regulus , This earlier Roman invasion had been born of frustration with a war of attrition and a desire to exercise a newly acquired naval power . Rome had established the superiority of her legions over the Carthaginian armies early in the war , but at sea the Punic navy reigned Supreme . The Romans responded by building their first great fleet in 260 BC and , after equipping their galleys with an ingenious boarding ramp , the corvus , defeated the Punic navy . In 256 Regulus and his co-consul , Lucius Manlius Vulso , were entrusted with a massive fleet and small army . Their mission was to clear the seas of the Punic navy , land an army in Africa and force Carthage to Surrender . Off Cape Ecnomus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 350 Punic ships , sinking 30 and capturing 64 galleys for the loss of only 24 . With the way to Africa now clear , Regulus landed his forces near Cape Bon and advanced inland . The Romans had two full legions Supported by Italian allies-a total of about 15,000 infantry . Regulus ' Mounted arm was quite weak , however , since only 500 cavalry had been brought over on horse transports . Carthage assembled an army and sent it to engage the Romans at Adys . The Carthaginian generals foolishly attempted battle in tough , hilly terrain , where their mounted forces were ineffective . The result was a great victory for Regulus . Carthage , weary of the long war and with no array in the field , Sued for peace . At that point , Regulus felt he held all the cards . The terms he dictated to the Cartha , hn envoys were extremely harsh-so harsh , in fact , that the council in Carthage resolved to renew the struggle . New levies were raised and more mercenaries were hired , including a professional Spartan captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a highly disciplined force composed of 12,000 foot , 4,000 horse and 100 war elephants . Regulus , meanwhile , had made no effort to strengthen his army with local Libyan or Numidian auxiliary cavalry . It was an inexcusable omission . When the newly formed Carthaginian army took up a position on the plain before tunes , Regulus obligingly advanced to do battle in this perfect cavalry arena , even though his horse was outnumbered 8-to-1 . Xanthippus began the battle with an elephant charge against the Roman center , white his cavalry chased the few Roman horsemen from the field . The elephants were eventually driven off or brought down by the Romans , but not before wreaking havoc on their legions . The Punic phalanx then struck before the Romans could reorganize , while the Carthaginian cavalry assaulted their flanks and rear . The Roman army was virtually annihilated , with 13,000 killed and 500 captured , including Regulus .
