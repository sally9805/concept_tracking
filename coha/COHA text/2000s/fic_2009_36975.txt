when northern light held that little radio station in the large palm of its hand . Eleanor Dew was behind the receptionist 's desk and behind clever Eleanor was the studio . She looked up , surprised . Harry rarely darkened the station door except at night when he came in to do the late shift and got away with saying and playing whatever he liked . He paused beside her desk and with a broad wink asked about the new person on air . <p> " Hired off the street , " she told him . " The parting shot of our erstwhile manager . " <p> " Well , well , well , " said Harry . <p> Despite the red glow of the on-air light , he then pushed through the studio door , only to be met by one of the great mysteries of life . We look so very different from the way we sound . It 's a shock , similar to hearing your own voice for the first time , when you 're forced to wonder how the rest of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you sound . You feel dislodged from the old shoe of yourself . <p> Harry had pictured somebody short and compact with sun-bleached hair , fine blue eyes , great legs , a woman in her thirties . But Dido Paris was tall , big-boned , olive-skinned , younger . Glasses . Thick , dark , springy hair held back off a wide face . Faintest shadow on her upper lip . An unreasonably beautiful woman . She did n't look up , too intent on the newscast typed in capital letters on green paper , three-part greens , the paper-and-carbon combination the newsmen typed on . <p> He turned to check who was in the control room . Eddy at the controls and one of the newsmen standing at Eddy 's shoulder . An audience , in other words . <p> Harry took out his lighter , flicked it , and put the flame to the top corner of the green . And still she did n't look up . <p> An upper lip as downy as he imagined her legs might be . And yes , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs were visible below a loose blue skirt , and the mystery of her voice was solved . She was European . European in her straightforwardness , her appearance , her way of speaking , which was almost too calm , except when the page was alight . Then her voice caught fire . She stopped turning her long pencil end on end , pacing herself . Stopped speaking altogether . Her eyes went in two directions - one leg on shore , the other in the canoe , but the canoe was pulling away from shore and shit - she picked up her glass , poured water on the flames , and read with jolting speed , repressed panic , to the very last word at the bottom of the page . <p> The news clip came on , she switched off her microphone and looked up wildly at eye . But he was n't boyish , he was balding , bespectacled , square-jawed . She noticed his cauliflower ear . <p> " You 're Harry Boyd , " she said . <p> And she , too , had imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the relaxed , late-night growl that she heard only as she fell asleep . The man who 'd once been a big name in radio , she 'd been told . He was shorter than she 'd expected and his hands trembled . Half an hour later , perched on Dido 's desk , bumming a cigarette , Harry asked her how she 'd come by her intriguing accent . She studied him , not quite willing to forgive his outrageous behaviour , until he asked if she was Greek . Then out bubbled her easy and seductive laugh . <p> No chance . She 'd grown up in the Netherlands near the German border , the daughter of a Latin teacher who 'd listened to the BBC and written questions to " London Calling " about expressions he did n't understand . Her father had a reel-to-reel tape recorder and taped programs off the radio . She learned English at school , she told Harry , but her pronunciation was terrible and so she 'd asked her father to make some tapes for her , and then she practised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Noel Coward himself , acquiring in that way her peculiar European-English accent , which she hated . " I figured marriage to a Canadian would solve my problem , but it has n't . " <p> " Two minutes , " said Harry , " and you 're already breaking my heart . " <p> " It did n't last , " she said . <p> " Then we have something in common , you and I. " <p> He slipped her glasses off her face and breathed on the lenses and polished them with his handkerchief , then slid them back over her nose , saying , " And Dorothy Parker said men never make passes at girls with glasses . " <p> " Parker ? " <p> " Dorothy . A writerly wit who famously claimed to be ' too fucking busy and vice versa . ' " <p> Dido was only semi-amused . To Eleanor the next day she called Harry " the loser , " a put-down softened by her accent ; it came out " lose-air . " She said he 'd taken a drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ashtray . " So cheap , " she said with a shake of her head and a faint , unimpressed smile . <p> " But not without charm , " countered Eleanor . " Charm , sex , insecurity : that 's what Harry has to offer . " <p> Dido was more interested now . <p> " He 's too old for you , Dido . " <p> But his age was the last thing Dido minded . <p> Harry was forty-two . Winds of ill repute had blown him back up on these shores-a man with a nearly forgotten reputation for brilliance , one of those lucky luckless people who finds his element early on and then makes the mistake of leaving it - radio for a television talk show , where he 'd bombed . In short order , he was fired , his personal life fell apart , rumours rose up and settled down . A year ago an old boss stumbled across him sleeping in a hotel lobby in Toronto and pulled a few strings to get him a night shift in the Northern Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen years ago . At square one again , but with a difference . Now he was an old fish in a small pond . <p> And yet it suited him - the place , the hours , the relative obscurity . <p> Stories about him circulated : how he had numerous ex-wives , and a tremendous tolerance for liquor , and some dark deed in his past - some disgrace . Professional , certainly . Sexual ? No one was quite sure . His cauliflower ear suggested a life touched by violence . His trembling hands sent granules of instant coffee scattering in all directions . " Harry 's been here , " they would say in the morning , surveying the little table that held mugs , spoons , the electric kettle , the big jar of Maxwell House . <p> In that first conversation Harry asked Dido about her husband , tell me all about him , and she jested that she 'd married almost the first person who asked her , a fellow student at McGill , but when he brought her from Montreal through the gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the driveway . " And we just looked at each other , " she said , turning the oversized man 's watch on her wrist in what Harry would come to understand was a yearning , nervous habit . " We just looked . " Harry saw them , a man and woman unable to take their eyes off each other , and the picture cut into his heart . <p> After a moment Dido shrugged , but her face still ran with longing and regret . The situation became impossible , she admitted . She escaped the triangle by coming north . <p> " And your father-in-law let you go ? " <p> She gestured towards the entrance of the station . " I half expect him to come through that door . " <p> The radio station occupied a quiet corner a block away from main street . It had been an electrical supplies store once , Top Electric , and was that size . A one-storey shoebox in a town that had sprung up in the 1930s on the gold-rich shores of Great Slave Lake , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entering , the first person you saw was Eleanor Dew , who managed to be pretty even though no part of her was pretty . She had rather bulging eyes and a chin that blended into her throat , yet she gave off an idea of Blondness , a sort of radiance that came from having her feet on the ground and her head in heaven . At thirty-six she was almost the oldest person in the station and a poet at heart , reading Milton between phone calls - the community announcements coming in , the complaints and song requests , the mixture of personal and business calls for the six announcer-operators or the two newsmen or the station manager , who had run off with a waitress a week ago . <p> Her desk stood next to a plate-glass window that overlooked the dusty street leading up to the Gold Range , also known as the Strange Range , and to Franklin Avenue , the main street with two stoplights . Turn left on Franklin Avenue and you passed on one side MacLeod 's Hardware and the Hudson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its third-run movies and fifth-rate popcorn machine . Continue on in the same direction through the newest part of New Town , and then angle left , and eventually you came around to Cominco , one of the two operating gold mines that gave the town its initial reason for being . If , instead , you turned right on Franklin Avenue you passed the Yellowknife Inn on one side and the post office on the other , you passed the public library and the clothing store known as Eve of the Arctic . Proceed in a down-sloping northerly direction and you reached the oldest part of Old Town , an array of little houses and shacks and log cabins and privies , of Quonset huts and trailers and motley businesses , all of which seemed perfectly at ease on this rocky peninsula under the enormous sky . Well , they were n't competing with it . Yellowknife had only one high-rise and it was n't on main street , it was a lonely apartment building in the southeastern part of town . <p> A rudimentary place of ten thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copper , and in many ways it was a white blot on the native landscape . But it was as far north as most southerners had ever come . It was north of the sixtieth parallel and shared in the romance of the North , emanating not mystery but uniqueness and not right away . It had no breathtaking scenery . No mountains , no glaciers , in the winter not even that much snow . But after a while it grew on them , on some of them at least , on the ones who would never forget , who would think back on their lives and say , My time there was the most vivid time in my life . <p> Only two stoplights , perhaps , but such a traffic in voices . That summer a small but steady parade of poets came through town , unconnected to the parade of experts addressing Judge Berger at his inquiry into what would be , if it went ahead , the largest single development project ever undertaken in the Western world , a gas pipeline running across the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . Politics overshadowed poetry , as it always does . The poets came one at a time throughout the summer , a modest incursion and the first of its kind , organized by a local poetry lover and financed by the national council for the arts . The pipeline experts came in droves , it seemed , gathering at the gleaming white Explorer Hotel that dominated the road on the way to the airport . It was a time when Yellowknife was on the map , when the North was on everyone 's minds , when the latest scheme to extract its riches had gained so much ground that this summer of 1975 took on the mythical quality of a cloudless summer before the outbreak of war , or before the onset of the kind of restlessness , social , spiritual , that remakes the world . <p> Harry went to a few of the literary readings at the public library . He went with Eleanor , who wrote poetry for her own pleasure , until he lost patience with what he called the empty wordplay . How can a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch your heart ? You might remember the poet , he declared , but you wo n't remember the poem . To underscore his point he typed out verses from a poem he admired and taped them to the wall in the one and only announce booth , where their message about death and its haunting aftermath was like a skull sitting on the console . The poem was by Alden Nowlan , who came from Harry 's part of southern New Brunswick , and it described the foolish time in the poet 's life when he worked alone at night in a radio station and could n't believe anyone was listening , for " it seemed I was talking / only to myself in a room no bigger / than an ordinary bathroom . " Then one day he had to cover a fatal collision between a car and a train , and Nowlan the broadcaster turned into Nowlan the appalled listener . " Inside the wreckage " of the car , three young men were dead , but the car radio was still playing and " nobody could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top margin Harry scrawled , Do you ever wonder where your voice goes ? <p> The more personal question he avoided asking himself . How had he ended up back here , where he 'd started , in the little rabbit warren of rooms known as CFYK ? Sitting in the announce booth , feeling his own life collide with itself . <p> Eleanor was the station 's gatekeeper . From her desk she controlled access to a single hallway that led like a short main street directly through the guts of the station to an exit that tumbled you back out into the northern summer - to a garbage bin full to overflowing with tape so edited , so beknuckled and thickened with white splicing tape as to be deemed unsalvageable , finally , by the head technician in his basement lair . Crusty Andrew McNab presided over the station 's nether region of workbenches , labeled shelves , crowded corners , and his own tidy desk . For seventeen years he 'd practised frugality and extravagant disdain , fathead being his favourite term for anyone conceited enough to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lair . The newsroom , just large enough for two newsmen and two desks and one editing machine , was another . Its firmly closed door lay directly in the line of fire between Eleanor 's desk and the front door of the station through which the town 's characters liked to come . Mrs. Dargabble , for instance , with her lofty , loquacious , regular plea for classical music . I do n't expect opera , but a little Mozart from time to time ? Eleanor could n't have agreed more . She wrote down the request , then tossed it sadly into the wastebasket as soon as the poor woman turned her back , since there was no hope , she knew . No hope for Mozart in Yellowknife . <p> Until Harry Boyd passed by one day recently and rumbled at the hefty , flapping , fragile woman , " Do you like Lucia Popp ? " <p> " She sings the Queen of the Night , " said the startled Mrs. Dargabble . <p> " Tonight I 'll play her for you . Turn on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . You under stand . " <p> By now Harry was haunting the station at all hours and it was obvious to everyone why . He wanted to be around Dido Paris . <p> " How will I recognize him ? " Harry had asked her , his voice a-growl with mock irony and serious intent . " This fancy man of yours . Your father-in-law . " <p> She had a long , slow smile . " You 're a romantic , Harry . " " I 'm not ashamed of it . " <p> He saw her face give way once again to such tender sadness that his lonely insides twisted and tightened . But then he took heart . " You like older men . " <p> Dido leaned back and laughed at him . " Harry , you 're so transparent . " <p> He was n't ashamed of that either . He recognized in Dido a deep streak of melancholy that he happened to share , and he was fascinated , not least by a childhood he guessed was partly to blame .

The scroll in her hands curled back into itself . She had not been reading it  --  her thoughts had drifted long since .

She sent her own khi through it and out into the forest : roots running strong into the earth , whisper- fine grasses moving with each light breeze , small creatures dwelling in branch or under root . A much brighter , stronger pulse of khi reverberated through the wood , one that could only be lven . Eliani drew back from it , as the lven did not trespass upon one another 's khi . <br> She opened her eyes and carefully set her scroll in a notch of two branches where she had stored little trea - sures since childhood .

Fear set her heart pulsing before reason reminded her that an alben would not be walking in daylight even if he dared to cross the mountains into Alpinon . <br> No , it was a Greenglen , his hair not white but pale blond , as was common to his clan . He wore a cloak of Clan Greenglen 's colors  --  sage lined with silver  --  and carried a long bow slung over one shoulder . <br> Greenglens rarely were seen in Alpinon , though their homeland of Southfld shared a nearby border .

The command of the Guard would pass to her as well . This was her last day of youth and irresponsibility . A little mischief might be forgiven her this last time . <br> Grinning , she turned her attention to her quarry . She tensed her thighs , balanced carefully , and sprang to the forest floor , making no more sound than the falling of a leaf . <br> Turisan walked at his ease , enjoying the rich earthen smell and myriad colors of autumn leaves , only mildly curious at first about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been followed . <br> He was not averse to meeting a patrol from Alpinon 's Guard . In fact , he half hoped to encounter one , for he had not been in this realm previously and did not know the way to Highstone . His pursuer , however , though certainly lven , was evidently not a guardian . Such a one would have challenged him , not stalked him . He therefore continued to stride through Alpinon 's fair woodlands , which were full of life and untouched by lven hands , as unlike as could be to his home in Glenhallow . Pausing to examine a spray of scarlet leaves , he saw a flicker of movement above . His brow creased in a slight frown . It was impolite to treat a visitor so , whether or not they knew who he was . He began to tire of the game . <br> And now he could hear his father berating him for not bringing along an escort suitable to his dignity . Had he been accompanied by ten of Southfld 's Guard , as Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stalk him . In Jharan 's view , a member of Southfld 's governing house should never travel unattended though he walk through the most benign lands . <br> Indeed , he should not walk . He should ride a finely caparisoned steed or , better yet , take his ease in a chariot emblazoned with marks of state , surrounded by a mounted escort . <br> It was such excess of ceremony that made Turisan long so often to be gone from the court at Glenhallow . The more he learned of the intricacies of governance , the more he yearned for the simplicity of a wild wood , a clear stream , and the flicker of stars through leafy branches . <br> This journey was in part an escape from court formalities , though at the end of it they awaited him again . His father had sent him here on a visit of ceremony , to pay respects and carry messages to Lord Felisan , the governor of Alpinon , and to witness the confirmation of his heir . <br> Turisan had made no objection to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his father 's nextkin . Lord Jharan 's eyes , so often stern , grew soft with fondness whenever he spoke of Felisan , and that alone made Turisan curious to know him . He also expected the visit to Alpinon 's woodlands to satisfy his longing for wildness . Yet even here in the forest he was to have no peace , it seemed . Annoyed all at once , he turned in midstride and nocked an arrow to his bow , aiming it amidst the branches overhead . <br> " You have followed me half the afternoon . Come down and declare your business with me or begone . " A moment 's silence . Then a rustle in the branches , and a lanky lven female in worn and dusky hunting leathers emerged , landing softly before him . She brushed a strand of nut- brown hair from her green eyes and stood gazing at him . <br> " Peace to you , friend . I meant no harm . We seldom have visitors from the south . " <br> Turisan lowered his bow . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , then a corner of her mouth curled . " I am called Kestrel . I am kin to Lord Felisan . " Surprised , Turisan paused to return arrow to quiver while he reevaluated her status . No rustic this , what- ever her appearance . Even a lesser relative of Lord Felisan deserved his respect , though she had not given her true name . He bowed . <br> " It is to bring messages to Lord Felisan that I have come . Will you honor me by guiding me to his house ? " The green eyes lit . " Messages ? From Southfld ? " Turisan smiled . " From Glenhallow . " <br> He had thought that mention of Southfld 's seat of government would thrill her . She drew a breath , as of deep plea sure , then surprised him by replying with quiet dignity . <br> " It will be my honor to guide you .

I left it with the guardians at Midrange , thinking to enjoy a walk . I believe it is not far from here to Highstone ? " <br> " No , not far . " She smiled , her mouth twisting with private amusement . <br> Not a rustic , and not quite so young as he had first thought .

He had indeed dwelt too long at court . The woodlands , all ablaze with autumn , grew denser . Turisan 's legs told him they were climbing , though at first the slope was scarcely noticeable . It became a true hill before long and led to numberless others increasing in size , greenleaf trees giving way to tall pines as they proceeded from foothills into the mountains proper . Though he would have enjoyed a rest , his guide seemed unweary , and he followed her onward , reflecting that the day he could not outmarch a slip of a Stonereach girl was the day he should renounce his heritage and become a magehall acolyte . <br> The mountain air took on a chill as eve ning fell , and warm glints of light had for some time been showing through the trees when they reached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled valley . It led to a town centered on a level shelf of rock where houses spread out from an open public circle and clung to the steep , rocky walls above and below . A pale river cascaded through the chasm to the north , and he heard the distant roar of a waterfall . <br> His guide paused at the edge of the circle . " Welcome to Highstone . " <br> This was Alpinon 's chief city , then . Smaller than Turisan had expected . The houses were built of stone with steep slated roofs to shed snow . Their ornamentation was minimal and rough compared with that of Glenhallow 's graceful buildings , but after the long walk , the glow of their lighted windows in the blue- shadowed dusk was especially welcoming . <br> The grandest structure was a long hall situated on an outcrop commanding the valley a little way above the public circle . Its roof timbers were carved with stag 's heads , the token of Clan Stonereach . A row of tall arched windows gave a muted glow through tapestries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come , they will be at table .

He would berate me for keeping an honored guest waiting . Surely you are tired and hungry ? " <br> " Ah  --  yes . " <br> " Come , then . " <br> She led the way across the circle with a backward glance to see that he followed , and started up the steep stone stair beyond that led up to the governor 's hall . Reflecting that a lack of formality did not necessarily imply a poor table , Turisan hastened after his guide . <br> Eliani could not wait to see the faces of the house - hold when she introduced their exotic guest .

The hunting clothes he wore were of fine soft leather , dyed in subtle shades of green and richly embroidered . The silver clasp that pinned his cloak was intricate in design and bore a large glinting white stone . He left it in the cloak as it was taken away , as if its possible loss would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewel Eliani possessed . How rich his life must be !

Caught in her curiosity , she returned the smile and stepped forward . " May I know your name so that I may give you a proper introduction ? " <br> He seemed to hesitate for an eyeblink , then answered quietly . " It is Turisan . " <br> " I have heard that name . " Eliani gazed at him , frowning slightly , certain they had never met .

Eliani was glad to see that the meal had not progressed very far . Her father looked up and beckoned to her , but instead of taking her place beside him , she strode up to his chair , bowed formally , and stepped to one side . The conversation fell away as the house - hold became aware of the stranger she had brought with her ; thus , it was to the accompaniment of music alone that she made her announcement . <br> " Lord Felisan , I bring you a visitor from afar .

" I was present at your naming day , but you will not remember that , of course . Lord Jharan does me honor to send his own son with his tidings . " Eliani drew a sharp breath . She hoped it would go unnoticed and quickly assumed a disinterested smile . As Turisan clasped arms with her father , she thought his glance flicked to her . <br> Lord Jharan 's son , was he ? Heir to the governance of Southfld , the second oldest and second largest lven realm . She closed her eyes briefly , silently chiding herself for not remembering where she had heard his name . <br> " I thank you , Lord Felisan , and crave pardon for arriving unheralded .

" <br> Eliani , standing beside her chair , was gratified to see Lord Turisan glance up at her in surprise . Her suspicion was correct , then : He had thought her of little importance . She returned a sweet smile , and he acknowledged her with a bow before taking his seat . That appeased her somewhat . Even more so did the kind thanks he made to the cousin who gave place to him . Eliani helped herself to warm bread from the basket before her , listening to the pleasantries that passed between her father and his guest .

" I would be honored if Lady Eliani would show it me . " <br> Eliani felt color rising to her cheeks . No one had called her " lady " before . That honorific was reserved for governors and their heirs , the masters of guild- halls , and other persons of high responsibility .

Perhaps because she had always thought of House Jharanin as stately and dignified , dwelling in luxurious palaces and occupied with lofty concerns of governance . <br> Turisan did not fit that picture at all . What governorelect of any self- importance would undertake a journey on foot and alone ? <br> She would . She laughed and choked a little on her wine . <br> Her father raised an eyebrow at her . " I hope you will stay with us some few days , Turisan . We are to celebrate a handfasting soon . Your presence would grace the occasion . " <br> " A handfasting ? " Turisan 's gaze shifted briefly to Eliani , then back . " It would be my honor to attend . Are both parties from your house hold ? " <br> " No , only Beryloni . She is the daughter of my departed lady 's brother . She sits just there , in the blue gown , and beside her is her partner to be , Gemaron , who is of the Steppegard clan . " <br> Turisan turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goblet . " I wish you great happiness together . " <br> Others took up the toast . " Great happiness ! " Eliani raised her cup , smiling , and sipped . She , too , wished them great happiness , though her feelings were shadowed with reserve . Handfastings were rare among the lven , for it was a lifelong pledge , and the breaking of a promise was unthinkable . Part of the creed , to keep good faith and to speak truth . <br> Eliani had witnessed only one other handfasting , that of her father 's sister , Davhri , many years earlier when she herself was still a child . Her most vivid memory was of the ribbons : blue and violet for Stonereach , orange and gray for Clan Sunriding , and the mage- wrought handfasting ribbon woven with images and blessings  --  all tied into a complicated braid about the joined hands of the couple who were to be forever bound , body and spirit . <br> Davhri , whom Eliani had loved fondly but whom she now scarce remembered , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gifts and messages had come from time to time , brought by traders , but Davhri had never revisited Alpinon . Thus , Eliani tended to associate handfastings with loss . <br> Cup- bonds were much more common than handfastings . A promise to be true for a year and a day was no less serious a pledge , but one more easily kept . Eliani had cup- bonded once herself , though she had regretted it halfway through the year . She was not an easy partner , it seemed . She and Kelevon had fallen into disagreement and dissolved their bond the day after its year at last had concluded . She had gone immediately into the Guard , and Kelevon had departed for his home in the Steppe Wilds and not been heard from again . <br> The minstrels struck up " The Battle of Westgard , " and Eliani glanced toward them , feeling a tingle of foreboding . She tried to shake it off . It was not unusual for them to perform the lay , for the tale of how the Bitter Wars had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alben and drive them westward across the mountains , was a favorite of her father 's . Eliani remembered hearing it at his knee , begging him to tell how he had fought in the battle , and his answer that it was at Midrange and Skyruach that he had fought , not at Westgard . The Bitter Wars had ended many centuries before his birth . <br> The meal drew to a close , and the house holders gradually took their leave . Many paused to exchange greetings with Lord Turisan . His courtesy was flawless , his voice soft , and he seemed never at a loss for a kind word , even to Eliani 's youn gest kin , Curunan , who at twenty summers was just old enough to sit with the house hold . <br> Felisan rose from the table . " Well , then , Lord Turisan , come into my chamber and give me Lord Jharan 's news . Good night , yes , good night . " He waved to the last few guests as he started toward the back of the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Turisan , who glanced toward her and yielded the way . In turn she held aside the tapestry for him to enter the governor 's private quarters . Only she and her father dwelt here now . Others of the house hold lived in their own homes in the city . <br> Lord Felisan led the way into his study . Scattered scrolls of music and tomes thick with history lent the chamber a comfortable air . Eliani banished a worry that Lord Turisan would think the place unkempt and held her chin high as she fetched mead and chalices from a cupboard . If Lord Jharan 's son disliked his surroundings , he could take his leave . <br> Continues ...
