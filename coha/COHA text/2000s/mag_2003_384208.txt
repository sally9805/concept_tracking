14 ways to learn to feel lucky you 're alive <p> My friend Amy Cohen happened to be experiencing joy right when I called . " I just went off the Atkins Diet . It was pure joy to shove a granola bar into my mouth , " she laughed . When pressed for further sources of joy , she admitted she gets great joy from a bargain ( finding $169 boots for $39 ) and from preparing a delicious meal . <p> It 's not that I do n't appreciate a sugar rush or a great buy , but I 'm not sure they bring me joy . <p> The more I searched for sources of joy , the more I found myself in a vast sea of pleasures , thrills , and gratifications . An email chain letter of " natural highs " cited making eye contact with a cute stranger , listening to the rain , and riding a roller coaster . Hmm . Nice , but do they bring me joy ? Not really . <p> I could n't help but feel that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could sink my teeth  --  and heart and soul  --  into . I was looking for some science . Seek More " Oh Wow ! " Times <p> Prevention columnist Ned Hallowell , MD , author of The Childhood Roots of Adult Happiness , says , " Joy is the intense moments  --  the moments of success , the moments of connection , the moments of really appreciating beauty and saying , ' Oh wow , I 'm so lucky to be alive ! ' " <p> Such moments can come to us in bursts of bliss or in the form of more sustaining and hard-won gratifications , according to Martin Seligman , PhD , of the University of Pennsylvania and author of Authentic Happiness : Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment . " Gratifications are the activities we like doing that absorb and engage us fully . " Where to Look <p> Whether your joy  --  let 's call it " high happiness "  --  comes in the rush of a sugar high , the glow of professional accomplishment , or deep spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a deluge of delight , most would agree that we want more of it . <p> But you wo n't find joy from the lottery tickets lucked in your wallet . Nor will you find it in wrinkle-removing plastic surgery . Studies have shown that money - even winning the lottery  --  and beauty are not reliable or substantial sources of happiness . According to happiness researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky , PhD , of the University of California , Riverside , life circumstances only account for 10% of happiness . Half depends on our genetic " set point , " which is kind of like the weight our body bounces back to after that crash diet . About 40% of our happiness is influenced by what we do deliberately to make ourselves happy . And being happy is the key antecedent to joy . " You ca n't be joyful all the time , " says Lyubomirsky , " but people who are happy are going to be joyful more frequently . " <p> Here 's what experts believe you can do to increase the joy , both large and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right <p> Experts agree that optimistic people are happier people . Those who look on the bright side experience more happiness than those who try to " see things as they really are , " according to Lyubomirsky . It 's a process scientists call reframing : If you try to cast negative events in a positive light , and you see the silver lining , you can turn a bad situation into a joyful one . <p> Take my friend Carol . Shortly after she got married , she complained that her work-at-home husband did n't know how to do laundry . Whites , colors  --  they were all washed together . Then a coworker pointed out , " He 's just trying to help . " When Carol spoke to her husband about it , he told her , " I want to do my fair share to give you more time to relax . " She 's learned to overlook the mistakes and enjoy their extra chorefree time together . <p> " If you only focus on what 's wrong , you will not experience joy . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains M. J. Ryan , author of 365 Health and Happiness Boosters . " But when you focus on what 's right about a situation  --  the exact same situation  --  you 're increasing the possibility that you will experience joy and high happiness . " 2 . Be Grateful <p> We all know we 're supposed to count our blessings , but we may not realize that in this platitude lies one of the most significant ways of increasing joy . " It sounds clich , but research actually supports this , " says Lyubomirsky . One study found that those who regularly recorded what they were thankful for in " gratitude journals " showed higher levels of optimism , enthusiasm , attentiveness , and energy , and they felt better about their life as a whole . 3 . Remember the Kid You Were <p> In just one lazy Sunday afternoon , I watched my two children create joy for themselves again and again , first in a game of hide-and-seek , then whirling around to Carole King music in princess costumes . Smiles , giggles , belly laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in children , " says Pamela Gail Johnson , founder of a group called Secret Society of Happy People , a Web site she started to provide a forum for those who want to encourage the expression of happiness . " As adults , when do we lose that ? That experience of being in that natural high ? " <p> It 's a question Hallowell explores in The Childhood Roots of Adult Happiness . " I wanted to look at the sources in childhood that lead to joy in adulthood , " he says . " If you have this feeling when you get up in the morning of ' can-do , wanna-do , ' you have friends you look forward to seeing , you have activities you look forward to doing , you can usually trace those things back to childhood , " he explains . <p> He discovered that the capacity of adults to experience great joy and enthusiasm about life has its roots in how they did things as children . He cites five basic steps that should ideally take place in a child 's development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key adults ; discovering one 's passions through play ; practicing those passions ; mastering them , thereby reinforcing confidence and self-esteem ; and experiencing recognition from the outside world . " It 's never too late , " says Hallowell . " If you 're willing to set aside your sense of embarrassment and to play , then you can rediscover the childlike qualities that are strongly associated with joy . " 4 . Be Kind <p> Random acts of kindess increase happiness , according to Lyubomirsky 's research . " There are lots of consequences that come from showing kindness that help you stay happy and make you happier , " she says . A study conducted at the University of Virginia found that merely witnessing acts of kindness , loyalty , and heroism created a significant elevation in mood and increased the desire to perform good deeds ( witness the long lines of blood donors after 9/11 ) . 5 . Spend Time with Your " Homeys " <p> Although a rich social and romantic life does not in itself guarantee joy , it has a huge effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the happiest among them were more social , spent less time alone , and reported strong , supportive relationships with friends , family , and romantic partners . 6 . Do n't Overdo It <p> The problem with joy is that it 's so delicious that you just want more and more . But what gives you joy once may not work a second time . If you love gourmet vanilla ice cream , there 's no way to maintain the joy of that first taste on your tongue . The more you eat it , the less joy it brings . " Neurons are wired to respond to novel events , " Seligman points out in Authentic Happiness . " The more redundant the events , the more they merge into the unnoticed background . " Space out your joyful pleasures . 7 . Savor Every Moment <p> You can increase joy by paying concentrated attention to momentary pleasures . This may sound obvious , but some researchers have turned savoring into a new field of study , one devoted to heightening the experience of pleasure , of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences include sharing them with others , basking in praise others give you , sharpening your perceptions and senses by focusing intensely on something ( closing your eyes when you listen to your favorite music , for instance ) , and completely immersing yourself in something you love doing . Or as a friend says , " Roll in it ! " 8 . Move <p> If you 've experienced " runner 's high " or maybe just the afterglow when you 're done , you know how joyful exercise can be . Several studies have shown that exercise is a powerful mood elevator . One small pilot study found that 30 minutes of daily aerobic exercise worked faster than drugs to ease depression . 9 . Rest <p> Peace , quiet , and solitude can also create joy , and some research suggests that we may have an inborn need to " zone out " once in a while . In an exploratory study , researchers observed three babies who turned away or blocked their eyes in response to overstimulation . Mothers who recognized this behavior and gave their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put On a Happy Face <p> " There 's good evidence that just smiling and looking like you 're happy will make you happier , " says Lyubomirsky . Studies show that even muscular changes in your face can elevate your happiness , as can good posture . My friend Susan refers to it as " the blush effect . " To apply blush to your cheekbones properly , you need to smile . " When I do that , I always think it 's going to be a great day , " says Lyubomirsky . It works , she says , because " if you act like you 're a happier person , you can experience all these positive social consequences . You make more friends . People are nicer to you . And these things can have real consequences . " 11 . Pursue Your Goals <p> " Having a set of high goals that are important to you , that are compatible with your values , and that are mostly pleasant to work for " helps augment your happiness level , explains happiness researcher Ed Diener , PhD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that the pursuit of your goals , not even necessarily attaining them , can increase joy . 12 . Get into the Flow <p> A very profound joy can emerge when you are in a state called " flow , " a term coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi , PhD , director of the Quality of Life Institute at Claremont Graduate University in California and author of several books on the subject . Flow is the form of joy , ecstasy , and happiness that can emerge when people are so absorbed in a challenging activity they love that they lose themselves . Time stops , and they become at one with what they 're doing . What creates flow is highly individual , but people experience it in everything from running and rock climbing to writing , painting , and playing music . 13 . Play To Your Strengths <p> The best way to achieve flow is by identifying your strengths and virtues and then using them , says Seligman . First , you have to find out what they are . ( For a test to help you determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which you can reach through www.prevention.com/links . ) Then , he says , " You have to recraft your work life , your love life , and your leisure to deploy those strengths and virtues as much as possible . " <p> Seligman 's advice reminds me of Jill , a food service worker . Feeling very unfulfilled in her current job , Jill decided she was going to change her work style by tapping her greatest strength : her people skills . She made sure her interactions with her cafeteria customers were the social highlight of their day . She addressed everyone by name , took special orders with a smile , and used friendly chitchat to distract them from their workday . " Once you identify your Strengths , you can transform a tedious task into an experience that brings flow much more frequently , " explains Seligman. 14 . Find Your Calling <p> Some find meaning in religion or spirituality . Others find a sense of purpose in their work . Finding your calling may be more of a lifelong mission than a simple strategy for increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling like you are here for a reason  --  can perhaps bring the greatest joy of all . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : about 40% of our happiness is influenced by what we do deliberately to make ourselves happy <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : life circumstances only account for 10% of happiness <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Andrea Malin <p> <p> Freelance writer Andrea Malin pursues joy in Los Angeles . <p> ROLE MODEL <p> Inger Osteraa has been fighting a very aggressive form of nonHodgkin 's lymphoma for nearly 2 decades . Since 1985 , her body has been frequently peppered with tumors that have fractured her spine and nearly shut down her liver . At various times , some of the top doctors in the US told her she had " just months to live . " Now free from cancer for nearly 3 years , the 67-year-old Osteraa reflects on how , even in the face of this deadly disease , she never lost her ability to experience joy . <p> " When you can hear the minutes ticking , and you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your time will be up , you see things so clearly , " she says . " You just know without a doubt where your values are and why you 're alive , and you 're so grateful for each moment . " <p> At one point , when she thought she had only a short time to live , she planted bareroot roses with her toddler grandson , even though she knew they would n't bloom for months . Connecting to nature and to someone she loved " brought me tremendous joy , " she says . <p> Osteraa now gets " unbelievable joy " every afternoon by going outside to read with her legs resting on her 125-lb dog , Clyde , something she says takes her back to the joy she felt as a young child growing up in Norway when her dog would pull her on skis through the woods . <p> JOY IS GOOD <p> Joyful , happy people have more friends and better marriages . They 're more creative and more successful in their work . A recent study indicates that they even live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong association between positive emotions and longevity in a study of 180 nuns . <p> The more positive emotions such as contentment , gratitude , hope , love , and happiness the nuns expressed at age 22 , the more likely they were to be alive 60 years later . Other studies have suggested that positive emotions can make the immune system stronger . <p>
