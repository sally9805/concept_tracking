BUYING Headnote A serious road racer with knee-friendly gearing // THE THING WE CA N'T GET OVER IS ... how this bike tries so hard to be on the cutting edge , its spec sheet seems designed by marketers : integrated headset , sloping top tube , compact geometry , carbon-fiber seatstays . You ca n't blame K2 for trying to be ahead of the curve-that 's what everybody does . But there 's not a lot of substance to back it up . Bike makers use compact geometry to make lighter , presumably faster bikes , but this results in a low handlebar relative to the saddle . It 's fine for serious race bikes  --  you can assume the rider is going to want an aggressive position and you 'll have the physical flexibility to back that up-but you ca n't say the same of people interested in triple-chainring road bikes . The Mod 3.0 ( which shares frames with the $2,100 Ultegra-equipped Mod 4.0 and the $3,300 Dura-Ace-wearing Mod 5.0 ) places you in that aggressive position . Additionally , the 41mm-wide top tube sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit your knees if you pedal knees-in . You want to like the Mod 3.0-the ride is excellent , the price is pretty good and you get some good real-world gearing on a bike with some snap-but unfortunately , its execution falls a bit short of the mark . $1.749 * * 1/2 BUY IT IF You want to believe you 're race-ready , but need help on the hills . FORGET IT IF You ca n't handle a high saddle/low handlebar position . 7 WORDS ABOUT THIS BIKE Smooth . Balanced front-to-rear . Aggressive riding posture . Compact . Sidebar BEST THING ABOUT THIS BIKE : Sidebar Aggressive geometry and balanced ride make this bike feel good if you 're a fast rider , WORST THING : Limited sizes  --  just three sizes are intended to span the 48-61cm size range . That 's asking a lot . We compare the Small to a 52cm , the Medium to a 55cm and the Large to a 59cm. based on top tube dimensions of 53. 55 and 58cm . Size these bikes by top tube-but do n't be surprised if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps on every current bandwagon-integrated headset. compact frame . carbon-fiber seatstays . If it 's new . you 'll find it here . RIDE SMOOTHNESS : The carbon seatstays transmit less rearwheel vibration to the saddle and provide a good tactile match for the carbon fork . You get nice consistent feel front to rear . making easy work of hard corners . This bike is comfortable over the Sidebar long haul , but with good ride feel that lets you corner hard solely by feel . BAD INTEGRATION : The Cane Creek IS headset places the headset bearings directly in the head tube . The smooth fork-to-head tube profile looks sleek . but let this headset go out of adjustment for long and you 'll ovalize the head tube . lunching the frame . A better spec would be Cane Creek 's Zero Stack headset. which preserves the Sidebar integrated took but puts the bearings into separate cups . Better yet : a standard , nonintegrated headset . READY TO GO : Shimano 's race  --  ready SPD-R pedals mean you can hit the road right from the showroom floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-sided mountain platforms . though . // <p>
