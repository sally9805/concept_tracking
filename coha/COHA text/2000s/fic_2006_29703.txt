Chapter One Val is not herself today . It is n't like her to be so subdued . She does n't call to me as I make my way up the carved marble staircase , its edges worn smooth by generations of arrivals and departures . She does n't wave me over once I reach the top of the stairs and wrestle through the crowd , elbowing past Wednesday afternoon revelers raising their glasses to celebrate the end of another workday . She does n't look up after I get myself a beer and approach her table , or offer any comment as I stand , dumbfounded , before the remarkable structure she has created . Here , in the mezzanine bar at Grand Central , with only a few square inches of table to work with , Val has erected a tower of shopping bags representing nearly every one of New York 's best B 's ( Bendel 's , Barneys , Bergdorf 's ... ) . I 'm ashamed to say , in my own state of mentally unstable not-quitemyselfness , this is the only unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't be doing for a while . I take a deep breath and put on the happiest happy-hour smile I can muster . " Look at you ! " I chirp , holding my beer glass in a death grip , shoehorning myself into the three-inch gap between the empty chair and the edge of her table , goggling at the bags while using my free hand to push them out of my way . I poke a Burberry back from the edge of the table , where it threatens to drop into my lap , but that only makesthe rest of the pile teeter precariously . I clamp down on the Boyd 's of Madison at the top and struggle to shift my chair to one side without spilling beer on myself . Val makes no effort to help . " If you would n't mind , " I say , " could you help me move this stuff , just the tiniest-oh , my goodness ! " Val is crying . No . Not crying-sobbing . Tears skid down her flushed cheeks to her jawbone and pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocktail . She 's got mascara running down her wrist onto the sleeve of her pink cardigan , her demure blond pageboy is all mussed , and she 's groping around in her pink quilted Chanel chain purse , perhaps for a tissue . " What is it ? You poor thing ! " I 'm no longer thinking about shopping bags and am halfway to forgetting why I 've been feeling so sorry for myself . Until this moment it had n't occurred to me that Val could get this upset about anything . Her tears are as unsettling as anything else I 've dealt with over the past few days . " What 's wrong ? What 's the matter ? This is n't about me , is it ? Because , really , I 'll be all right . " She ca n't possibly be crying over me . Heaven knows I 'm upset-rootless , loveless , and unexpectedly jobless . But Val is distraught . Trembling and pale , with a red , brimming gaze that , at last , she turns on me . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's ... ahem ... " She takes a bracing swig of her pink parasol drink , sets it back down , and folds her hands on the table . " My husband is cheating , " she says . " Again . " Her delivery-calculated , with a pause for emphasis after each word-makes it seem as if she were accusing me . It might be that all at once she looks more incensed than heartbroken , or maybe it 's the way she 's staring me dead in the eye . " Again , " she repeats icily , and it 's as if I were the other woman , here to confess all and beg forgiveness for coming between Val and her husband . That 's when something dawns on me . Several somethings . One , Val is a vintage-clothing connoisseur who would no sooner patronize any of these B-stores than she would cry like a baby in the middle of Grand Central Terminal on an early-May afternoon . Two , Val only wears black . Three , demure ? Blond ? Pageboy ? And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband . It 's a joke . Val does n't take anything seriously . It 's a joke , right ? Val 's here to buy me a consolation drink to distract me during my time of crisis , and this is just another diversionary tactic . It 's typical Val behavior , but it 's freaking me out . " You 're not acting like yourself , and you 're scaring me . " I try to say it jovially , as if I 'm in no way about to start crying myself . But instead of erupting into laughter and pointing to a hidden camera , Val just covers her face and sobs some more . Her commitment is impressive . Still , how long will the show go on ? I 've got jangled-enough nerves already , having spent two hours in a Midtown unemployment office at a mandatory New York State Department of Labor group-orientation lecture : " Job-Hunting Tools for the Twenty-first Century . " ( " Does everyone here know what the Internet is ? " ) After that , I got all turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long blocks west , only to end up on a desolate , trash-strewn stretch of Eleventh Avenue , leaving only two thousand nine hundred ninety-nine and two-tenths of a mile between me and my former life in Los Angeles-all right , the San Fernando Valley-before realizing I should have been heading east the whole time . All this probably explains why she figures it out first . " Oh , perfect . This is just great . " She lifts her head , sniffles , and dabs under each eye with her tissue . " You want Val . " Later I 'll regret not having paid more attention to this moment . I wo n't have , though , and that 's too bad . It might have been an early clue that perhaps I 'm unfit for the new career that 's about to fall into my lap . What was it they just said at the unemployment office ? Our experience is our toolbox , with our skills as the tools ? Well , it seems I 've locked my observational skills into my toolbox and left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York five weeks ago for a fancy focusgroup moderator position at Hayes Heeley Market Research , and up until getting " restructured " right out of that very same position two days ago , I worked , went for coffee , and had lunch with Valerie Benjamin nearly every day . After this much concentrated time in her company I know what she looks like down to the last eyelash . I know her taste in men , clothing , and cocktails , her life 's philosophy , and her family background . I know she has an identical twin . In fact , one of Val 's favorite conversational pastimes is counting the many ways her sister is spoiled and selfish , sharing stories of behavior so abysmal I always find myself grateful to be an only child . I know Victoria does n't work , and that she is married to a commercial real-estate broker named Steve . Five years ago , minutes before her three-hundred-guest New York Times-approved wedding at their parents ' estate in Greenwich , Connecticut , Vickie got so overwrought that she screamed a string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and refused to get up . Val was beginning to think she 'd have to give Vickie a slap-and , considering the scene to which she was being subjected , was looking forward to it the tiniest little bit-when Vickie snapped out of it abruptly on her own , splashed some cold water on her face , and an hour later was flitting happily around her reception without so much as an apology to Val . Right now , though , with Vickie here before me , bawling , I only feel bad for her . " I am so sorry . I did think you were Val . You must get that all the time . " " Constantly . " Through her tears , Vickie sounds sarcastic . I 'm this close to excusing myself and slinking away when Val , the genuine article , materializes at the top of the staircase . I wave her over . Saved ! Now , in my own defense , I am preoccupied today . But Vickie is right ; who could mix up these two ? Yes , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching stewardess noses with the same smattering of freckles across the bridge . But Vickie wears a wedding ring , the Junior League hairdo , and sensible Ferragamo flats . And here 's Val , my friend and , until Monday afternoon , office colleague . Ecstatically single , with an unruly electric-red downtown crop , deliberately smudgy eyeliner , vintage sixties go-go boots , and a mod little miniskirt in which it 's pretty clear Vickie would n't be caught dead . Vickie : Greenwich . Val : Greenwich Village . " Iris ! And Vickie ? " Val , too , looks perplexed . " Val , it was the strangest coincidence . " Life is looking better already . I provide a quick recap of the past five minutes while Vickie grudgingly clears two inches of space for her sister . Val 's black vinyl skirt makes a squeaky noise as she sits down . " It 's not that strange , " she says . " Manhattan is just a big small town . People bump into each other all the time . It can be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd known I 'd bump into you here , I never would have come , " Vickie retorts . " Now , now , Vickie-poo , I was n't talking about you . Tell me , Iris , is there a walk of shame in the San Fernando Valley ? " I lean closer , grazing my chin on the corner of a shopping bag . " Walk of shame ? You mean Walk of Fame ? " " Walk of shame . When you go back with someone to his apartment and then , on your way home the next morning , run into one of your mother 's ladies-who-lunch chums , who can tell you 're blatantly wearing an outfit from the night before . " Vickie eyes Val 's hemline . " Sort of like you 're doing now ? " " I 'll have you know , this is not a walk of shame . This is office attire , " Val snaps . " I 'm simply explaining to Iris that New York is a small town . " " Technically there 's no walk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensing an argument about to happen . " So , then , what were you wearing the first night you stayed over at Teddy 's place ? " Val asks me . " And what did you wear home ? " I scrutinize my glass of Rolling Rock . Had I thought to get something in a bottle , with a paper label , I could now make myself busy peeling it off . " Come on , Iris . Do n't tell me you wore his old sweatpants ; that 's a hundred times more shameful-a fashion faux pas . " " I just sort of never left . " I 'm blushing . " I just kind of stayed . " Both twins stare at me . " Never mind . " I take a drink . " Where I come from , people scurry out to the curb when no one 's watching , dive into their cars , and speed home . " " There you go , " says Val . " Another difference between the coasts . In New York , everybody walks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living here , it 's only a matter of time . " " Well , I 've never done any such thing , " Vickie says . Val peers at her in a way that suggests her sister 's presence has only now sunk in . " Why are you here , anyway ? Do n't they have bars in Yorkville ? " " I 'm waiting for a train . And I do not live in Yorkville . Third and Eighty-fifth is Yorkville . Lexington and Eighty-fifth is the Upper East Side . " " Whatever you say . " " I know what I 'm talking about , Val . My husband works in real estate .... " Vickie starts crying again . I look to Val for a cue , but she only rolls her eyes . Vickie sniffles loudly . " I ca n't believe he 's cheating on me ! " Val does n't react . She rakes her hand through her hair , which was black the last time I saw her , Monday afternoon . " Like it ? " she asks me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering something really light , maybe pink , maybe platinum , but then I thought- " " Excuse me ! " Vickie shouts . Val sighs . " All right , Iris , here 's the story . My sister suffers from seasonal suspicion disorder . Every six months , usually spring and fall , she decides hubby Steve is cheating on her , then retaliates by spending his money on new clothes . " " That 's just mean ! " Vickie swipes at her tears again with her tissue . " It 's true , " says Val . " Remember the time you found the lipstick on his shirt , flipped out , and then realized it was your own lipstick ? " " It was Bobbi Brown Number Four ! That could have been anybody 's lipstick ! Every woman in America has a tube ! " Val stops tapping her right index finger softly but insistently on the top of our table long enough to wave over a waitress and order drinks for herself and me . Then she gestures at Vickie . " And another-what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vickie says . Val rolls her eyes again . The waitress goes off to the bar . Val pulls out a cigarette and holds it in her mouth , unlit . " No smoking , " hisses Vickie . " No shit , " hisses Val . This day keeps getting stranger and stranger . There are still hours to go before it 's over , and I 'm stuck with the only twins in history who lack that supernatural love bond everyone always goes on about . Vickie does have a point , though . At my former marketing company in Brentwood , I once had to round up women for a focus group on makeup . A few days later , I watched from the observation room as one participant waxed rhapsodic about the MAC lip pencil in " Spice , " and the universally flattering lipstick Bobbi Brown Number Four . " I have that , too ! " said another , producing a tube from her Coach bag . The rest nodded knowingly and dug around in their purses until there were half a dozen Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sherman Oaks and picked up a tube . It was right on the way home , since Teddy and I had just bought our house in Studio City . At least I still have that lipstick . " This time there 's no question , " Vickie continues . " He 's taken up jogging . At the crack of dawn . " She gives us a look like , " See ? " " Pandora 's Box . " From above my head , the waitress places a drink in front of Val , who lunges at it . " Virgin . " The waitress sets down Vickie 's daiquiri . " Draft . " She hands me a beer . I guzzle the remains of my first and give her the empty glass . Vickie takes a dainty sip of her daiquiri . " My husband has gone on a fitness kick . At least , that 's what he would have me believe . Men are such dogs . " " You 're making absolutely no sense . " Val seems to be speaking directly to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done any sport sweatier than golf since his squash days at Yale . Then three weeks ago , out of nowhere , he decides it 's time to get in shape . " " He was looking a little soft around the middle , " Val interjects . Vickie responds with one of what I have already come to recognize as her patented **37;1344;TOOLONG **27;1383;TOOLONG looks . Val shuts up . " And since then he 's been getting up every weekday at six forty-five , dragging the poor dog out of his little bed , supposedly to go jogging in the park . Except that ca n't be where he 's going . When he gets home , he 's never even sweaty , and neither is the dog . " " I did n't think dogs got sweaty . Do n't they , like ... " What a lightweight . I 'm four sips into my second Rolling Rock and already starting to slur my speech . " Like , drool or whatever it 's called ? " Forgotten the word . Better stop drinking now or I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , relocate three thousand miles from home , to a noisy , grimy , indifferent city , in order to be laid off . " Pant ! " Val starts to giggle . " That 's it , pant . " I ca n't help laughing myself . It 's all too absurd . " Hey , " says Val , " maybe the dog 's the one straying . " I should keep out of it . I should . I ca n't . " Dogs are such dogs . " " No ! " Val howls . " Dogs are such men ! " " Oh , forget it ! " Vickie starts crying again , with gusto . " This is why I never see you , Val . This is why I hate to tell you anything personal . You have no idea the stress I 'm under right now . No idea ! " She struggles to free herself from her chair , which is wedged between our table and the back of the woman behind her , and pulls an overnight bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll wait for my train on the platform . " I realize how heartless I 've been acting . Val must feel equally bad , because she grabs her sister 's mascara-and-cashmere- covered wrist . " Where are you going ? " She sounds contrite . " To Greenwich , " Vickie says . " I want Mother and Daddy . " " Do n't you think you ought to stick around here and-Iris , how do you say it ? - work on your marriage ? " " Work on your marriage , " I repeat somberly . " No . " Vickie starts to gather up the rest of her packages . Not an easy feat , since the lot of them is taking up as much cubic footage as my entire apartment . The couple at the table next to us ducks to avoid being B-headed by a Bloomingdale 's Big Brown Bag . " I should hire myself a detective to catch him in the act , and then use the evidence to stick him for a big , fat divorce settlement . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's oversimplifying things . In the **35;1412;TOOLONG state of California , for example , your assets get divided right down the middle , regardless of who did what to whom , unless you were cynical enough to draw up a prenuptial agreement . I could tell her , but I keep my mouth shut . " Here 's a plan ! " Val pipes up . " While you 're gone , want me to keep an eye on him ? I could follow him around and see where he goes . I could be your scheming lookalike hiding in the bushes ! " ( Continues ... )
