It is nearly impossible for any Southern writer to avoid the specter of William Faulkner . The world he created in Yoknapatawpha County , perhaps the best-known plot of literary real estate , exerts its influence over the aspirations of the region 's writers and the expectations of readers and critics . It could therefore be construed as an act of either bravado or foolishness that Randall Kenan , who lives in Memphis and was raised in North Carolina , has also constructed a fictional Southern locale , a swampy speck called Tims Creek , N.C. " I could have run , " says Kenan , 37 , of the inevitable comparisons , " but I 'd be spending a lot of energy in vain . It 's like the Bible in that sense . Faulkner 's language is just a part of you . " <P> Kenan does not , however , shy away from reinterpreting the sacred texts . While Faulkner explored the remnants of a failed white aristocracy , Kenan is concerned mainly with Tims Creek 's black population , descendants of the former slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , introduced in his novel A Visitation of Spirits ( 1989 ) and the short-story collection Let the Dead Bury Their Dead ( 1992 ) , recurs in the novel he is currently writing , Fire and the Baptism , due early next year . It is a community clinging to the traditions of the past while grappling with the pressures of the modern-day South . In A Visitation of Spirits , Kenan writes how a town once bound by the practice of harvesting tobacco by hand withers with mechanization . <P> Not surprisingly , Tims Creek is much like Chinquapin , N.C. , the impoverished outpost where Kenan grew up " going to hog killings one minute and watching Star Trek the next . " He was sent there at six weeks old by his parents , who were unmarried and residing in New York , to be reared by his great-aunt . His upbringing became the collective endeavor of a group of elderly relatives with abiding faith in both religion and folklore who spent endless hours telling fantastical stories  --  " tales of ghost dogs and people rising from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found its way into Kenan 's fiction . In the short story Clarence and the Dead , the young title character demonstrates an unnerving gift of clairvoyance : " He told Sarah Phillips to stop fretting , that her husband forgave her for the time she tried to stab him with that hunting knife ; he told Cleavon Simpson his mama despised him for tricking her to sign all of her property over to him ... he told people things a four-year-old boy ai n't had no business knowing the language for , let alone the circumstances around them . All from people dead , five , six , ten , twenty and more years . " In Tims Creek , spirits , zombies and mystics are as real as tobacco fields and televisions . <P> " One of the things I have always taken issue with in Southern literature is that it is almost all rooted in social realism , " says Kenan . " I grew up around people who took the Bible literally , and still do . " So in college , when Kenan first read such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plans to be a physicist and turned to writing . " When I encountered writers who wrote about spirits like they would changing a carburetor , I realized you can come at this form from an entirely different vantage point . "
