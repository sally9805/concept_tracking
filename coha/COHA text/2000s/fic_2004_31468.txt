Cole Steele could hear the screams coming from the room down the hall . He knew those nightmares intimately , because the demons also visited him every time he closed his own eyes . He was a grown man , hard and disciplined and well able to drink his way through the night if necessary , but Jase was just a young teenager . Guilt edged his anger as he made his way through the dark to the boy 's room . He should have done something , to spare his half brother the horrendous legacy of his own past . In truth , he had n't been in touch with his father for years . It had n't occurred to him that his father would remarry a much younger woman and produce another child , but he should have considered the possibility , not just dropped off the face of the earth . Cole shoved open the bedroom door . Jase was already fully awake , his eyes wide with the terror of his memories . Something twisted hard and painfully in Cole 's chest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was n't good at soothing the boy . He had been born and bred in roughness and still had a difficult time being gentle . Worse , Jase barely knew him . He was asking the teenager to trust him in spite of his reputation and the rumors of attempted murder flying freely through the town . It was no wonder the boy regarded him with some suspicion . " I hate Christmas . Ca n't we just make it go away ? " Jase asked . He threw back the covers and paced across the room , the same edgy tension in his teenage body that Cole had in abundance as a grown man . Jase was tall and gangly , like a young colt , all arms and legs , looking a bit like a scarecrow in flannel pajamas . He had Cole 's dark hair , but his eyes must have been his mother 's , as they were a deep , rich brown . Right now , his eyes were wide with terror , and he turned away to hide his trembling . Cole felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only Jase had poured himself into books and Cole had become a hellion . Cole knew what it was like to hide the bruises and the terror from the rest of the world . He had grown up living in isolation and hiding , and he still lived that way , but he would be damned if this boy would endure the same . " Did he shoot your dog for Christmas ? " Cole asked bluntly . " That 's what he did for me the last time I wanted to celebrate the holiday like my friends . I have n't ever wanted a Christmas since . He also beat the holy hell out of me , but that was insignificant next to the dog . " Jase faced him slowly . The horror was still all too stark in his eyes . " I had a cat . " " I 'll bet he said you were n't tough enough and that only sissies needed pets and Christmas . He wanted you to toughen up and be a man . Not get attached to anything . " Jase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did a lot of things . " " You have burn marks ? Scars from cuts ? He liked to whip me with a coat hanger . And when I did n't cry , he took to using other things . " " I cried , " Jase admitted . " I did too , at first . He was a mean son of bitch , Jase . I 'm glad he 's dead . He ca n't touch you anymore . I 'm not going to lie to you and tell you the nightmares go away because I still have them . We both lived in hell and he had too much money for anyone to want to believe us . " Cole rubbed his hands through his thick black hair . " He was sick , Jase . I got out , changed my name thinking he 'd never find me , and stayed as far from him as I could possibly get . That 's no excuse . I should have kept tabs on him . Maybe I could have gotten you away from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have let me go . " " You know what they 're all saying , do n't you ? They think I had something to do with his death . " Jase nodded , his eyes suddenly wary . " I 've heard . Why did you come back ? " " I was named your guardian in his will . It was the first I 'd heard of you . I did n't know you existed until five months ago . I knew he must have done the same thing to you and your mother that he did to me and mine . I thought I could protect you , at least until you 're old enough to live on your own . I figured I would be a better guardian than anyone else the court might appoint or that our father had named if I did n't accept . " Dawn was creeping in through the huge plate-glass window . Cole watched the sun come up . It was cold , and the ground outside was covered with several feet of snow , turning the hills into a carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you cooking ? " Cole managed a lazy shrug even though he really wanted to smash something . It was always there , that volcano inside him , waiting to erupt . The thought of his father , the time of year , it was n't all that difficult to bring rage to the surface . " I thought we 'd go into town and give them all something more to gossip about . " Jase met Cole 's eyes squarely . " They say you killed the old man and that you 're planning to kill me next . Sixty-four million dollars is a lot of money , twice as much as thirty-two . " " They do say that , do n't they ? " Cole said . " And do n't forget the ranch . It 's worth twice that easily , maybe more with the oil and gas deposits . I have n't actually checked into how much yet . " His eyes had gone ice-cold , a piercing blue stare that impaled the boy . " What do you say , Jase ? Because in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as I 'm concerned . " Jase was silent a long time . " I say I 'm glad you came back . But I do n't understand why he left us the money and the ranch when he hated us both so much . It does n't make any sense . " He looked around the enormous room , frowning . " I keep expecting him to show up in the middle of the night . I 'm afraid to open my eyes because I know he 's standing over the bed , just waiting . " " With that smile . " Cole 's voice was grim . Jase nodded , a small shudder betraying the fact that he was n't as calm as he tried to seem . " With that smile . " He looked at Cole . " What do you do when the nightmares come ? " He punched his fist into his pillow . Once . Twice . " I hate this time of year . " Cole felt a sharp pain in his chest and the familiar churning in his gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tamped down the smoldering anger and hung on to control for the boy 's sake . " I drink . I 'm your guardian , so I have to say that 's not allowed for you . At least not until you 're a hell of a lot older . " " Does it work ? " " No , " Cole said grimly . Honestly . " But it gets me through the night . Sometimes I go to the workout room or the barn . I hung a heavy bag in both places , and I beat on them until my hands hurt . Other times I take the wildest horse we have and go out into the mountains . I run the hills , using the deer trails , anything to make me so tired I ca n't think anymore . " " None of that works either , does it ? " Jase had tried physical activity as well , but he was finding that talking quietly with his half brother was helpful . More helpful than anything else he 'd tried . At least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same torment . It created a bond in spite of the ugly rumors that surrounded his tough , harder-than-nails half brother . Cole shook his head . " No , none of it works , but it gets you through the night . One night at a time . He 's dead , Jase , and that 's all that matters . " Jase took a deep breath . " Did you kill him ? " " No , but I wish I had . I used to lie awake at night and plan how I 'd do it . That was before Mom died . Then I just wanted to get out . " Cole studied the boy 's face . " Did you kill him ? " He concentrated his gaze on the boy . Every nuance . Every expression , the way he breathed . The flick of his eyes . The trembling of his hands . Jase shook his head . " I was too afraid of him . " Cole let his breath out slowly . He had stayed alive using his ability to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling the truth . Jase had been in the house when someone had shot Brett Steele right there in his own office . He wanted to believe that the boy was n't involved in Brett Steele 's death . Cole was n't certain how he would have handled it if Jase had admitted he 'd done it , and for a man in Cole 's profession , that was n't a good thing . " Cole , did he kill your mother ? " For the first time , Jase sounded like a child rather than a fourteen-year-old trying to be a man . He sank down onto the bed , his thin shoulders shaking . " I think he killed my mother . They said she was drinking and drove off the bridge , but she never drank . Never . She was afraid to drink . She wanted to know what was happening all the time . You know what he was like , he 'd be nice one minute and come after you the next . " Brett Steele had been a sadistic man . It was Cole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having the power of life and death over anything , human or animal . He 'd enjoyed inflicting pain , and he had tortured his wives and children and every one of his employees . The ranch was huge , a long way from help , and once he had control over those living on his lands , he never relinquished it . Cole knew he 'd been lucky to escape . " It 's possible . I think the old man was capable of paying everyone off from coroners to police officers . He had too much money and power for anyone to cross him . It would be easy enough for a medical examiner to look the other way if there was enough money in bribes . And if that did n't work , there were always threats . We both know the old man did n't make idle threats ; he 'd carry them out . " Jase met his brother 's stare directly . " He killed your mother , did n't he ? " " Maybe . Probably . " Cole needed a drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Okay . " Jase pulled a pair of jeans from the closet . They were neatly hung and immaculately clean , just like everything else in the room . " Who do you think killed him ? If it was n't either of us , someone else had to have done it . " " He made a lot of enemies . He destroyed businesses and seduced as many of his friends ' wives as possible . And if he killed anyone else , as I suspect he must have , someone could have known and retaliated . He liked to hurt people , Jase . It was inevitable that he would die a violent death . " " Were you surprised he left you the money and guardianship over me ? " " Yes , at first . But later I thought maybe it made sense . He wanted us to be like him . He had me investigated and found I spent time in jail . I think he believed I was exactly like him . And the only other choice of a guardian he had was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . " Jase sighed . " Uncle Mike is just as crazy as Dad was . All he talks about is sin and redemption . He thinks I need to be exorcised . " Cole swore , a long string of curses . " That 's a load of crap , Jase . There 's nothing wrong with you . " He needed to move , to ride something hard , it did n't matter what it was . A horse , a motorcycle , a woman , anything at all to take away the knots gathering in his stomach . " Let 's get out of here . " He turned away from the boy , a cold anger lodged in his gut . He detested Christmas , detested everything about it . No matter how much he did n't want the season to start , it always came . He woke up drenched in sweat , vicious laughter ringing in his ears . He could fight the demons most of the year , but not when Christmas songs played on the radio and in every store he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people continually wished each other " Merry Christmas . " He did n't want that for Jase . He had to find a way to give the boy back his life . Counseling had n't helped either of them . When no one believed a word you said , or worse , was bought off , you learned to stop trusting people . If Cole never did another thing right in his life , he was going to be the one person Jase would know he could always trust . And he was going to make certain the boy did n't turn out the way he had . Or the way their father had . The brothers walked through the sprawling ranch house . The floors were all gleaming wood , the ceilings open-beamed and high . Brett Steele had demanded the best of everything , and he got it . Cole could n't fault him on his taste . " Cole , " Jase asked , " why were you in jail ? " Cole did n't break stride as he hurried through the spacious house . At times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no warmth in it , and as hard as he 'd tried to turn the showpiece into a home for Jase , it remained cold and barren . Outdoors it was biting cold . The frost turned the hills and meadows into a world of sparkling crystal , dazzling the eyes , but Cole simply ignored it , shoving his sunglasses onto his face . He went past the huge garage that housed dozens of cars  --  all toys Brett Steele had owned and rarely ever used  --  to go to his own pickup . " I should n't have asked you , " Jase muttered , slamming the door with unnecessary force . " I hate questions . " Cole paused , the key in the ignition . He glanced at the boy 's flushed face . " It is n't that , Jase . I do n't mind you asking me anything . I made up my mind I 'd never lie to you about anything , and I 'm not quite certain how to explain the jail time . Give me a minute . " Jase nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail , but it worries me because Uncle Mike says he 's going to take you to court and get custody of me . If I lived with him , I 'd spend all my life on my knees , praying for my soul . I 'd rather run away . " " He ca n't get you away from me , " Cole promised , his voice grim . There was a hard edge to the set of his mouth . He turned his piercing blue gaze directly on his young half brother . " The one thing I can promise is I 'll fight for you until they kill me , Jase . " He was implacable , the deadly ruthless stamp of determination clear on his face . " No one is going to take you away from me . You got that ? " Jase visibly relaxed . He nodded , a short jerky gesture as he tried to keep his emotions under control . Cole was n't certain if that was good or bad . Maybe the boy needed to cry his eyes out . Cole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction , even when the bastard had nearly killed him . It was a long way to the nearest town . There had been numerous guards at the ranch when his father was alive , supposedly for security , but Cole knew better . Brett had needed his own private world , a realm he could rule with an iron fist . The first thing Cole had done was to fire all of the ranch hands , the security force , and the housekeeper . If he could have had them prosecuted for their participation in Brett 's sadistic depravities , he would have . Jase needed to feel safe . And Cole needed to feel as if he could provide the right atmosphere for the boy . They had interviewed the new ranch hands together , and they were still looking for a housekeeper . " You , know , Jase , you never picked out one of the horses to use , " Cole said . Jase leaned forward to fiddle with the radio . The cab was flooded with a country Christmas tune . Jase hastily went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and he finally gave up in exasperation . " I do n't care which one I ride , " Jase said , and turned his head to stare out the window at the passing scenery . His voice was deliberately careless . " You must have a preference , " Cole persisted . " I 've seen you bring the big bay , Celtic High , a carrot every now and then . " The boy had spent a little time each day , brushing the horse and whispering to it , but he never rode the bay . Jase 's expression closed down instantly , his eyes wary . " I do n't care about any of them , " he repeated . Cole frowned as he slipped a CD into the player . " You know what the old man was all about , do n't you , Jase ? He did n't want his sons to feel affection or loyalty to anything or anyone . Not our mothers , not friends , and not animals . He killed the animals in front of us to teach us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing . He got rid of our mothers to isolate us , to make us wholly dependent on him . He did n't want you ever to feel emotion , especially affection or love for anything or anyone else . If he succeeded in doing that to you , he won . You ca n't let him win . Choose a horse and let yourself care for it . We 'll get a dog if you want a dog , or another cat . Any kind of pet you want , but let yourself feel something , and when our father visits you in your nightmares , tell him to go to hell . " " You did n't do that , " Jase pointed out . " You do n't have a dog . You have n't had a dog in all the years you 've been away . And you never got married . I 'll bet you never lived with a woman . You have one-night stands and that 's about it because you wo n't let anyone into your life . " It was a shrewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychoanalyzing Jase , but he damned well did n't want the boy to turn the spotlight back on him . " It 's a hell of a way to live , Jase . You do n't want to use me as a role model . I know all the things you should n't do and not many you should . But cutting yourself off from every living thing takes its toll . Do n't let him do that to you . Start small if you want . Just choose one of the horses , and we 'll go riding together in the mornings . " Jase was silent , his face averted , but Cole knew he was weighing the matter carefully . It meant trusting Cole further than perhaps Jase was willing to go . Cole was a big question mark to everyone , Jase especially . Cole could n't blame the boy . He knew what he was like . Tough and ruthless with no backup in him . His reputation was that of a vicious , merciless fighter , a man born and bred in violence . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , kind gestures that the kid needed , but he could protect Jase . " Just think about it , " he said to close the subject . Time was on his side . If he could give Jase back his life , he would forgive himself for not bringing the old man down as he should have done years ago . Jase had had his mother , a woman with love and laughter in her heart . More than likely Brett had killed her because he could n't turn Jase away from her . Jase 's mother must have left some legacy of love behind . Cole had no one . His mother had been just the opposite of Jase 's . His mother had had a child because Brett demanded she have one , but she went back to her model-thin figure and cocaine as soon as possible , leaving her son in the hands of her brutal husband . In the end , she 'd died of an overdose . Cole had always suspected his father had had something to do with her death . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's death . A few snowflakes drifted down from the sky , adding to the atmosphere of the season they both were trying so hard to avoid . Jase kicked at the floorboard of the truck , a small sign of aggression , then glanced apologetically at Cole . " Maybe we should have opted for a workout instead , " Cole said . " I 'm always hungry , " Jase admitted . " We can work out after we eat . Who came up with the idea of Christmas anyway ? It 's a dumb idea , giving presents out when it is n't your birthday . And it ca n't be good for the environment to cut down all the trees . " Cole stayed silent , letting the boy talk , grateful Jase was finally comfortable enough to talk to him at all . " Mom loved Christmas . She used to sneak me little gifts . She 'd hide them in my room . He always had spies , though , and they 'd tell him . He always punished her , but she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she knew it too , but she 'd still sneak me presents . " Jase rolled down the window , letting the crisp , cold air into the truck . " She sang me Christmas songs . And once , when he was away on a trip , we baked cookies together . She loved it . We both knew the housekeeper would tell him , but at the time , we did n't care . " Cole cleared his throat . The idea of trying to celebrate Christmas made him ill , but the kid wanted it . Maybe even needed it , but had no clue that was what his nervous chatter was all about . Cole hoped he could pull it off . There were no happy memories from his childhood to offset the things his father had done . " We tried to get away from him , but he always found us , " Jase continued . " He 's dead , Jase , " Cole repeated . He took a deep breath and took the plunge , feeling as if he was leaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring a giant tree into his home and decorate it , we can . There 's not a damn thing he can do about it . " " He might have let her go if she had n't wanted to take me with her . " Cole heard the tears in the boy 's voice , but the kid did n't shed them . Silently he cursed , wishing for inspiration , for all the right things to say . " Your mother was an extraordinary woman , Jase , and there are n't that many in the world . She cared about you , not the money or the prestige of being Mrs. Brett Steele . She fought for you , and she tried to give you a life in spite of the old man . I wish I 'd had the chance to meet her . " Jase did n't reply , but closed his eyes , resting his head back against the seat . He could still remember the sound of his mother 's voice . The way she smelled . Her smile . He rubbed his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father punished her . " I 'll think about the Christmas thing , Cole . I kind of like the idea of decorating the house when he always forbade it . " Cole did n't reply . It had been a very long few weeks , but the Christmas season was almost over . A couple more weeks , and he would have made it through another December . If doing the Christmas thing could give the kid back his life , Cole would find a way to get through it . The town was fairly big and offered a variety of late-night and early-morning dining . Cole chose a diner he was familiar with and parked the truck in the parking lot . To his dismay , it was already filled with cars . Unfolding his large frame , he slid from the truck , waiting for Jase to get out . " You forgot your jacket , " he said . " No , I did n't . I hate the thing , " Jase said . Cole did n't bother to ask him why . He already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole new wardrobe immediately . He pushed open the door to the diner , stepping back to allow Jase to enter first . Jase took two steps into the entryway and stopped abruptly behind the high wall of fake ivy . " They 're talking about you , Cole , " he whispered . " Let 's get out of here . " The voices were loud enough to carry across the small restaurant . Cole stood still , his hand on the boy 's shoulder to steady him . Jase would have to learn to live with gossip , just as he 'd learned to survive the nightmare he 'd been born into . " You 're wrong , Randy . Cole Steele murdered his father , and he 's going to murder that boy . He wants the money . He never came around here to see that boy until his daddy died . " " He was in jail , Jim , he could n't very well go visiting his relatives , " a second male voice pointed out with a laugh . Cole recognized Randy Smythe from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get Jase out of there or show the boy just how hypocritical the local storeowners could be , a third voice chimed in . " You are so full of it , Jim Begley , " a female voice interrupted the argument between the two men . " You come in here every morning grousing about Cole Steele . He was cleared as a suspect a long time ago and given guardianship of his half brother , as he should have been . You 're angry because your bar buddies lost their cushy jobs , so you 're helping to spread the malicious gossip they started . The entire lot of you sound like a bunch of sour old biddies . " The woman never raised her voice . In fact , it was soft and low and harmonious . Cole felt the tone strumming inside of him , vibrating and spreading heat . There was something magical in the voice , more magical than the fact that she was sticking up for him . His fingers tightened involuntarily on Jase 's shoulder . It was the first time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was in jail , Maia , " Jim Begley reiterated , his voice almost placating . " So were a lot of people who did n't belong there , Jim . And a lot people who should have been in jail never were . That does n't mean anything . You 're jealous of the man 's money and the fact that he has the reputation of being able to get just about any woman he wants , and you ca n't . " A roar of laughter went up . Cole expected Begley to get angry with the woman , but surprisingly , he did n't . " Aw , Maia , do n't go getting all mad at me . You are n't going to do anything , are you ? You would n't put a hex on my ... on me , would you ? " The laughter rose and this time the woman joined in . The sound of her voice was like music . Cole had never had such a reaction to any woman , and he had n't even seen her . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim ? " She teased , obviously not angry with the man . " It 's Christmas , the best time of the year . Do you think you could stop spreading rumors and just wait for the facts ? Give the man a chance . You all want his money . You all agree the town needs him , yet you 're so quick to condemn him . Is n't that the littlest bit hypocritical ? " Cole was shocked that the woman could wield so much power , driving her point home without ever raising her voice . And strangely , they were all listening to her . Who was she , and why were these usually rough men hanging on her every word , trying to please her ? He found himself very curious about a total stranger  --  a woman at that . " Okay , okay , " Jim said . " I surrender , Maia . I 'll never mention Cole Steele again if that will make you happy . Just do n't get mad at me . " Maia laughed again . The carefree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very aware of his body and its needs . " I 'll see you all later . I have work to do . " Cole felt his body tense . She was coming around the ivy to the entrance . Cole 's breath caught in his throat . She was on the shorter side , but curvy , filling out her jeans nicely . A sweater molded her breasts into a tempting invitation . She had a wealth of dark , very straight hair , as shiny as a raven 's wing , pulled into a careless ponytail . Her face was exotic , the bone structure delicate , reminding him of a pixie . She swung her head back , her wide smile fading as she saw them standing there . She stopped short , raising her eyes to Cole 's . He actually hunched a little , feeling the impact in his belly . Little hammers began to trip in his head , and his body reacted with an urgent and very elemental demand . A man could drown in her eyes , get lost , or just plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavily lashed , and some color other than blue , turquoise maybe , a mixture of blue and green that was vivid and alive and so darned beautiful he ached inside just looking at her . Jase nudged him in the ribs . Cole reacted immediately . " Sorry , ma'am . " But he did n't move . " I 'm Cole Steele . This is my brother , Jase . " Jase jerked under his hand , reacting to being acknowledged as a brother . The woman nodded at Cole and flashed a smile at Jase as she stepped around them to push open the door . " Holy cow , " Jase murmured . " Did you see that smile ? " He glanced up at Cole . " Yeah , you saw it all right . " " Was I staring ? " Cole asked . " You looked like you might have her for breakfast , " Jase answered . " You can look really intimidating , Cole . Scary . " Cole almost followed the woman , but at the boy 's comment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jase ? " The boy shrugged . " Sometimes . I 'm getting used to you . I 've never seen you smile . Ever . " Cole raised his eyebrow . " I ca n't remember actually smiling . Maybe I 'll have to practice . You can work with me . " " Do n't you smile at women ? " " I do n't have to . " Continues ...
