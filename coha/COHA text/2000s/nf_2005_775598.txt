THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD // After all of the time I 've spent in the public eye , you might think that finding out I was going to have a miscarriage moments before stepping onstage would n't shake me up , but it did .... // December 2001 . I 'm standing in the wings of the Palace Theatre in Hollywood , California , for MuppetFest , which is a tribute to Jim Henson as well as a fund-raiser for Save the Children . I 'm wearing a sleeveless black sequined dress and am in full hair and makeup . There is a great deal of excitement and energy in the air , and the audience , a full house , is having difficulty staying quiet . From where I 'm standing , I can see lots of grown-ups and kids milling around their seats , eating popcorn and talking . // In order not to be seen by the audience before my cue , I have to move farther backstage , to where Mr. Snuffleupagus is also waiting for his entrance . However , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make room for me . I end up having to wedge myself under his chin and between his front legs . Little bits of brown fur are flying everywhere , including up my nose . It takes all my effort not to sneeze . // It wo n't be long before the stage will be filled with color and sound and lots and lots of fur . So here I am , wearing a pink feather boa and long purple gloves and a huge fake diamond ring that keeps getting caught on the boa . And though it 's not yet evident , I 'm pregnant . But it 's not that simple . Yesterday , after some basic blood work , I was told that for some reason , something was n't right with the pregnancy , and additional testing was needed . I was reassured that it was a routine precaution . So , early this morning , before coming to the theater , I went back to the clinic to have more blood drawn . And while I was rehearsing , trying not to think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while I 'm waiting for my cue , my cell phone rings . The news is not good . My doctor says , " I 'm sorry , but the pregnancy is no longer viable . " I start to get very warm , and a huge lump forms in my throat . My doctor delicately explains that it is " nature 's way " of saying the baby is n't strong enough to survive , and it 's better to have it happen sooner rather than later . There is a pause , and then she carefully adds that I am going to have to wait for my body to naturally expel the pregnancy or reabsorb it . // " What ! " I can hardly grasp what I am hearing , and my vision begins to narrow . Just then another call comes through . It 's my husband , Chris , wanting to know if I have heard any news . Almost mechanically , I relay the information . I want to throw the phone across the stage and run out sobbing , but I am surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment I need to go onstage , decked out in a crazy costume , complete with a pig nose , ? la Miss Piggy . Did I mention I am pretending to be Miss Piggy and I 'm singing a duet with Kermit the Frog ? As I move away from Snuffy 's legs and look up at him , he is sympathetically blinking his huge eyelashes at me . The stage manager can tell that something is wrong as I wipe tears from my face , but he has no choice other than to cue the Muppet rock band to file onto the stage and then point at me for my entrance . As they say , the show must go on . // I HAD ALWAYS wanted to have children , and like most people , I just assumed it would happen when the time was right . My parents were divorced when I was quite young , and my mom never remarried . I was an only child in my mother 's house , and I used to beg her to adopt a baby . I desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of . My mother never did adopt a child , but my father remarried . Because my stepmother already had two children from a previous marriage , I had instant siblings . Then , luckily for me , my dad and stepmother added three wonderful daughters to the family . As a result , I was able to maintain a privileged , only-child status with my room while enjoying being part of a larger family with my dad . // Years have a way of flying by , and before I knew it , my four years of college were over . Since I had been working basically since I was eleven months old , I significantly cut back on the number of jobs I took while I was at school . It was a much needed break . I graduated with a degree in French literature and then went back to working full-time . After a few years of living on my own in Manhattan , I met , dated , and subsequently married my first husband , Andre Agassi . We were busy with our individual careers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have children , the appropriate time never seemed to present itself . Even though a great deal of love existed between the two of us , over time our lives seemed to become polarized and after two years , our marriage ended . It was a sad but amicable parting , and it was a blessing there were no children involved . // The real blessing , however , was that I was able to meet and fall in love with Chris Henchy , a comedy writer . To this day I believe that I fell in love with Chris the day we met , in 1999 , but I would never tell him that ! I had just gotten an American bulldog , Darla , and I brought her to meet friends of mine in the gym on the Warner Bros. lot . While there , the dog wandered off , and Chris brought her back . He was writing for a show filmed on the lot and loved dogs . We chatted and he made me laugh . I left without even knowing his full name , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend and told her I had found a guy I thought she should go out with . She told me she had starting seeing someone else . Because I had recently gotten divorced , I was n't even considering dating . Three weeks later , I was hosting a show in Washington , D.C. , for which Chris was the writer , and we started spending time together and became friends . I was struck by how thoughtful and funny he was . Because he knew my situation , there was no pressure , and we were just friends for quite some time . Finally , though , I had to admit that there was something between us that I could no longer ignore , and we started dating . Although we were each consumed by our individual jobs , he with writing and I with the last season of Suddenly Susan , we were both also quite ready to start a family . // Chris and I dated for two years and then became engaged . I was so clear about wanting to have children with this man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we were married . Though we did n't specifically try to have a baby , I chose to go off the pill . As the wedding approached , however , I was n't getting pregnant . It crossed our minds that there might be something wrong . Wanting everything to be in order before we got married , we decided to see a fertility specialist in Los Angeles named Dr. Joyce Vargyas . She performed several tests and an examination , determining that changes in my cervix were probably the reason why I was n't getting pregnant . Several years before , I 'd had cervical surgery to remove precancerous cells , resulting in scarring that caused my cervix to be tight and significantly shortened . // As a result , the entrance to my uterus had become severely impeded , making it very difficult for me to get pregnant . In the process of removing the precancerous cells , the surgery also removed the cervical glands that secrete the mucus necessary to transport the sperm . Without this bodily fluid , the " little spermies , " as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstream . I said , " No wonder it has n't been working-not only is the door closed , but the poor guys have been jumping into a pool with no water ! " Dr. Vargyas reassured us that this was one of the easiest fertility issues to overcome , though she did mention the possibility of my cervix becoming incompetent during pregnancy and prematurely opening up . After hearing the word " incompetent , " I could n't help feeling like damaged goods . With a very serious expression , Chris said to my physician , " Please , Doctor , we do n't like to use the word ' incompetent ' in our house . Could you just say she has a ' special ' cervix , or that she is simply ' cervically challenged ' ? " // Anxious to get started , we decided to try artificial insemination . In this procedure , which is done at the time of ovulation , the doctor inserts a catheter into the vagina , bypassing the scarred and narrowed tissue and putting the sperm directly into the uterus . Medically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sperm and egg 's point of view ( Chris begged to differ ) . After a couple of attempts , I still was n't " knocked up . " The doctor kept saying that it was the scarring on my cervix that was creating the difficulty and repeatedly making insemination unsuccessful . My eggs themselves , according to more ultrasounds , were looking very young and healthy . I was a fertile female . But it was suggested that even the thinnest catheter could not place the " stuff " where it needed to be . I tried to find comfort in the fact that at least my eggs were in good shape . // Soon Chris and I were given some additional surprising news . My doctor indicated that because of my age , I did n't have the luxury of time . She tactfully said that my biological clock was ticking and that it not only took time to have children , but if we wanted more than one , we needed to think about a more aggressive approach . The next step should be an in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurted out . " Is n't that for older women ? I 'm only thirty-six . You said I was fertile and healthy ! " // I admit , it was strange being informed that I was almost too old for something when I was in good shape and felt like a spring chicken . Undergoing IVF would mean enduring an involved and arduous series of procedures . It entailed drugs , shots , and surgery . This was quite upsetting to us , but it looked like we did n't have a choice . Chris and I figured that if this was indeed the path we needed to take , then we would have to mentally and physically prepare for it . We spent a lot of time educating ourselves about the entire process . // At first I shared this news only with a friend who had gone through IVF herself and was currently pregnant . She was so positive about the whole thing that we were encouraged . Soon we told our parents that we were availing ourselves of modern medicine and that they would get a grandchild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we would have our baby in no time . // Around this time , I was offered the chance to play Sally Bowles , the lead character in Cabaret , on Broadway . Sally and I could not have been more opposite . In the play , she becomes pregnant by accident and is forced to make a crucial decision . I was trying to get pregnant , and if it were to happen , it would be anything but an accident . Still , the focus on babies and birth struck me as ironic . However , I could n't survive eight shows a week for six months if I did get pregnant ( I was not going to be that Method ) , so I , too , had a choice to make . Chris and I discussed what a wonderful and rewarding opportunity doing such a tough play would be , and we felt it would be good for me to take the job . We had not yet begun IVF , and the wedding was getting close . Once all the festivities had passed and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin the fertility treatments . We thought this new schedule was going to work perfectly . // I accepted the part with excitement and a healthy fear . It would be the most challenging role I had ever taken , and I was invigorated by the prospect of playing it . I decided I would use my time wisely . I would get myself into the best possible shape for the character and fully commit to the experience of Cabaret . The physical preparedness and stamina necessary to sustain a Broadway schedule would be daunting , but it would surely be helpful in getting ready for the rigors of in vitro. // ON MAY 26 , 2001 , Chris and I were married in Palm Beach , Florida . My dad , who lived there and had been diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer , was unable to travel because of his chemotherapy treatments . So we decided to forgo getting married in New York , as originally planned , and invited a smaller group of people to travel to Florida , where we got married at the home of my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding was everything we had hoped for . The weather held , despite the threat of rain , and there was enough of a breeze that it was never too warm . The ceremony was timed for sunset , and as it began , Tuck &amp; Patti ( a powerful musical team whom I have loved and followed for years ) performed " Heaven Down Here . " We had written our own vows , and the service was intimate and spiritual without being heavy . By the time we got to the reception , when our comedian friends were trying to top one another in the joke department during their toasts , everyone was smiling . After dinner we had our first dance as " Mr. and Mrs. " And then I danced with my father . It was the last time I would ever dance with him , and I cherish the photo I have of us . The next day we continued the party with a barbecue on the lawn . Chris and I left the following day for a two-week trip to Fiji and Bali . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight into the two-week rehearsal period for Cabaret . // Two weeks is hardly enough time to learn a whole show , and I was practically paralyzed by the thought of opening on the Great White Way after only fourteen days of rehearsal . I had been on Broadway before , in the revival of Grease , but the cast was much bigger and I only had two solos . I had five solo numbers in Cabaret and , as the lead , was following in some impressive footsteps . // I stayed at my New York apartment , and Chris had to commute from Los Angeles to visit me on weekends . A bicoastal existence was not new to me , but it was a relatively novel one for my husband . Chris would be the one doing all of the traveling , but I justified it for him by saying , " Think of the frequent-flyer miles you 'll rack up . " We knew the schedule would be a bit hard on us as newlyweds , but starring on Broadway was such an incredible opportunity , and Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to be an unbelievably rewarding experience . // As it happened , I was doing Cabaret in September 2001 . I was alone on the eleventh , because Chris had n't planned to fly out until the weekend . I was awakened by a phone call from my friend Sherie , who said a plane had just hit the World Trade Center . I went into a state of shock . I turned on the TV . At that point , the reporters were still saying that it had been just a small commuter plane . I turned off the TV and headed outside . As I got to the street , I saw crowds of people all walking frantically : My apartment was next to the UN , which had been evacuated . It was so chaotic . I called Chris from my cell phone , and he told me to go home immediately , that the second tower had been hit . Although I 'd been walking around in a daze , once I got home , I was too agitated to stay there , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . But I could n't stay , so I headed back home . After leaving and coming back home two moretimes , I ended up at my sister Marina 's house . I 'd spoken to my parents , but soon all the circuits were busy , and I could no longer use my cell phone . I kept trying to reach Chris , and very late at night I got through . All I could do was cry . He reassured me that he would get to me as soon as he could . //
