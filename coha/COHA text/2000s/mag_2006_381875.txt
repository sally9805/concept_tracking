Riot gear , police barricades : Happy Halloween from Madison , Wis. ! For the past four years , the college town 's annual party  --  one of the country 's biggest  --  has turned violent , causing police to deploy pepper spray and arrest hundreds . With 100,000 revelers expected to flood Madison 's streets for this year 's bash , the city is preparing a new party-control measure . Its main drag , State Street , will be open only to those who pay a $5 entry fee . " We 're recovering some of the $600,000 in taxpayers ' money spent on crowd control , " says Mayor Dave Cieslewicz . " Some " may end up being " a little "  --  only 3,000 tickets have been sold . Partiers simply plan to move to venues nearby ( as in a block away ) , so few residents expect the fte to end happily . " People in masks feel uninhibited by morals , " says alderman Austin King , " let alone laws . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
