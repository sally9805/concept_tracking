Headnote Is living together still taboo ? he was nervous . He was divorced . They loved each other , but was right now the right time to move in together ? Could God overlook the sex issue ? Would the relationship last ? Ericka King had no answers to those questions , but she watched weekday courtroom dramas and therefore had a plan : create a contract . A cohabitation contract , to be exact . The one-page document spelled out the move-in date , who pays which bills and what happens if the two ever separated . After a couple of laughs-and kisses-the document was signed and Darrell Belts Jr . moved in . During the fall of 2003 , King and Belts became one of thousands of couples ushering in the newestAmerican trend : young adults unapologelically shacking up . " I said , Ok , God is not looking at this too favorably , but I feel like I 'm still doing what 's right in this siluation , ' ' " says Ericka . " I 'm seeing someone in a financial bind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went for it . " It has long been a taboo subject , this issue of sex before marriage and living together . Four decades ago , women who did it were deemed unseemly . Couples who did it were " living in sin " and were examples of what many observers described as unacceptable behavior . Then something happened in the 1960s , along with the Civil Rights and Black Power movements , birth control and peace movements . The United States reshaped its views of race , class and equality , while couples recast the shacking-up debate . By 1979 , White superstars Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal openly cohabitated . Black stars such as Samuel L. Jackson and LaTanya Richardson followed , living together for 10 years before marrying . Fast forward to 2007 , with hiphop mogul Diddy and his model girlfriend Kim Porter becoming the poster children for shacking up . The couple recently had twins , and very few people seem to tsk-tsk their unmarried status . This tacit acceptance of cohabitation is historic . For the first time ever , the Census @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples . These cohabiters comprise a mere 50.3 percent of coupled America , but that slight majority marks a societal swing for a country built on Judeo-Christian principles , which , in part , teach that sex and living together generally are benefits exclusive to marriage . " We do n't know of any other time like this , " says Lorraine Blackman , an associate professor at Indiana University and creator of the African American Family Research Institute . " This is an ongoing social experiment . We thought the ' ' 60s were pretty wild , but this is wilder than anyone 's imagination . " THE CONTRACT Ericka King-Belts , 30 , and her husband Darrell King , 34 , have been married for more than a year . The couple has a newborn , a 2-year-old and two other boys from Darrell 's previous relationship . They initially moved in together to save money and spend quality time after Darrell 's divorce . They did n't let Sunday school teachings affect them , and they both agreed to the cohabitation contract . " I laughed at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant . " I thought it was a joke . She watches a lot of the judge shows ... I signed it because I cared for her like I did , and I knew she cared for me . " Most research on shacking couples paints a statistical , and dismal , end to the relationship . But do n't tell that to Ericka . " I know what the statistics say , but there are so many factors you just can not measure , " says Ericka , who works for the Greater Cincinnati YWCA . " There are people who have cohabitated and are just fine . " SAVING IT FOR MARRIAGE Jaquelyn Johnson and Jerry Allien have dated almost a year . Jaquelyn is a preacher 's kid . Jerry attends one of Boston 's biggest churches . With one-bedroom rents hovering around $1,200 in their area , it makes financial sense for the couple to live together , but they 're holding out . " Every so often we talk about expenses and how much each one of us is paying for rent , " says Jaquelyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank . " We do n't have much time to spend together . If we lived together it would be easier because I would see him when I came home . " " But , " she adds , " we 're both interested in pursuing a Christian relationship . " Jaquelyn often butts heads with her friend , Kiana Hardnett , 21 , on the issue . Kiana recently moved in with her boyfriend . " My friend Jaque ? We have had 700 conversations about this , " says Kiana , who limits her shacking to two years . " I really just loved the idea of having him there every morning . We wake up together and have dinner together every night . It 's a comfort thing . " Kiana and her boyfriend are using this time to see if they are marriage-compatible , a move not often suggested by relationship gurus . The couple thinks it 's better to know now rather than later , after their assets have mingled . Blackman says their logic stems in part from high divorce rates in the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 who fear divorce . " They 've seen more divorce , lots of custody battles and paternity arguments , " says Blackman . " Eighty to 90 percent say they are terrified ... I had one person tell me if the person they dated left or died , it would n't hurt as much if they were n't married . " IS IT REALLY IN THE BIBLE ? Some studies say a lack of religion explains why couples shack up . But many who cohabitate do believe in a higher power , and their decision to live together is fraught with spiritual fear they either overcome or ignore . Technically , these couples say , the issue is n't in " the good book . " Yet most pastors , rabbis and imams , using modernday interpretations of holy-book rules , would likely condemn the practice . " There is no verse in the Hebrew Bible Old Testament that , on a plain sense reading , unambiguously forbids cohabitation , " says Jon D. Levenson , a Harvard University Jewish studies professor . " But the institutions about marriage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproval of the institution . " The New Testament encourages single Christians to remain single , but if they ca n't , marriage is the route to go , according to scholars . Yet and still , some religious leaders are reporting a marked increase in the numbers of couples whose marriage certificates share the same address-indicating cohabitation . " It really is about how do you define and understand what the Bible says about fornication and committing adultery , " says Reginald Blount , 45 , a church pastor and an associate professor at the Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary at Northwestern University . " I try not to bring down this ax hammer around fornication . For me , it is about covenant . If they are worthy enough to be in covenant with you , then you ought to be willing to take on the responsibility of being in marriage . " Shacking up did n't work for Stephanie Holmes , 36 , of Los Angeles . After living with a partner with intentions of getting married , she became pregnant and discovered the relationship was n't right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm so glad the only thing I have to worry about is my children and not a divorce too , " ' she says . Chicago shackers Tonisha Willoughby , 33 , and Michael Smith , 35 , testify to that firsthand . Both are divorced and neither is rushing back to the altar . " We know the difference between right and wrong , " says Michael , a real estate broker who 's open to remarrying but cautious about taking the plunge again . " But keep it real , " he says . " If you 're going over there night after night and you leave your clothes , what 's the difference ?
