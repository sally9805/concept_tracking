" Everybody Does It " // I PLAYED A LOT OF MONOPOLY GROWING UP . LIKE MOST PLAYERS of the game , I loved drawing a yellow Community Chest card and discovering a " bank error " in my favor- " Collect $200 ! " It never occurred to me not to take the cash . After all , banks have plenty of money and if one makes an error in your favor , why argue ? // I have n't played Monopoly in twenty years , but I 'd still take the $200 today . And what if a real bank made an error in my favor ? That would be a tougher dilemma . // Such things do happen . // Just to the east of where the Twin Towers once stood is a twenty-six-story office building that houses the Municipal Credit Union of New York City . The credit union has 300,000 members-federal , state , and city government employees-and over $1 billion in assets . Although a number of buildings near Ground Zero sustained serious damage when the towers came down , the MCU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the credit union did suffer a major computer failure that severed its link to the New York Cash Exchange ( NYCE ) , the largest network of automatic teller machines in the Northeast . // The network managers at NYCE quickly detected the severed link . The problem meant that while credit union members could withdraw money at cash machines , NYCE could n't immediately track these transactions or prevent members from overdrawing their accounts . NYCE leaders managed to get through to the credit union staff , even though the organization was in chaos . They posed the following choice : With just a few strokes on a computer keyboard , NYCE could cut off all cash withdrawals until the severed link was restored-which could take several weeks-or NYCE could let the cash keep flowing and sort out the withdrawal records later . Theoretically , anyone with a credit union ATM card could take out as much money as they wanted . The credit union would have to assume that risk . What did it want to do ? // The Municipal Credit Union of New York is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than eight decades ago . It is guided by an ethos of self-help and pooled aspirations . Many of its members are firemen and policemen and , in the wake of the attacks , it was widely assumed that some of these people had perished just across the street from the MCU 's office . There was no way the credit union would prevent its members and their families from accessing their money at a time of crisis . Thomas Siciliano , the general counsel of the credit union , said later : " We felt it would have hurt them badly and added to the chaos of the city . " The MCU trusted them to use their ATM cards responsibly . // Credit union members realized early on that their ATM use was n't monitored and that there was no limit to how much cash they could take out . As word spread , withdrawals skyrocketed . As many as 4,000 members overdrew their accounts , some by as much as $10,000 . One member used his card more than 150 times between late September and mid-October . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored . As the credit union got back to normal , it pieced together the full record of cash withdrawals after September 11 . Those who had overdrawn their accounts had left a substantial electronic trail , and the MCU set about tracking them down . Siciliano led this work . He initially suspected that most of the members ' overdrawing had occurred by accident , or maybe was prompted by emergency needs . The MCU assumed the best of its members , even those with average bank balances of less than $100 who had withdrawn thousands of dollars in just a few weeks . " We try to understand people , " Siciliano says . " We 're not just about the bottom line . " // The MCU sent letters to those with overdrawn accounts listing the money that was missing and asking for repayment . While some money was repaid , many letters got no response . More letters were sent-notarized letters with threats . After months of appeals , $15 million was still missing . At that point , the MCU called in the authorities . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the New York City Police Department , extended into the following summer . It resulted in scores of arrests . // A FEW BLOCKS AWAY from the credit union 's offices , another investigation was reaching its climax in the spring of 2002 , this one at Merrill Lynch 's newly repaired global headquarters on Vesey Street . After September 11 , Merrill Lynch had scattered 9,000 employees around back-office facilities in New Jersey and midtown . Months passed before it was able to move back downtown . When Merrill did return , morale at the company was low . Huge layoffs had depleted its ranks and profits were down in the new bear market . Worse , Merrill found itself cornered in a criminal probe led by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. // Before his assault on Wall Street made him famous , Spitzer was an obscure state official . Those who did know him were reminded of a character straight out of early-twentieth-century America . Wealthy by birth , with a father who bankrolled his political career , Spitzer is a muckraking crusader for the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention in a circuitous fashion . In early 2001 , a Queens pediatrician named Debases Kanjilal hired a lawyer to pursue a civil suit against Merrill . Kanjilal was among the legions of investors who got burned when the NASDAQ cratered in 2000 . Specifically , he had lost $500,000 on a single Internet stock , InfoSpace . Kanjilal 's instinct had been to sell InfoSpace when it was trading at $60 a share . But his broker at Merrill Lynch had urged him to hold on to the stock , advice that reflected Merrill 's public research reports that recommended InfoSpace as a " buy " stock . Standing behind those research reports , and affirming their recommendations in his TV appearances , was Merrill 's star analyst and " Internet stock guru , " Henry Blodget. // It is hard today to appreciate the influence once wielded by Blodget . Just over thirty years old in 2000 , Blodget was a Yale grad who had never aspired to stardom on Wall Street . He had tried instead to make it as a writer , and when that did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping him land a position at Prudential Securities . Blodget 's career was unremarkable until he shot to fame in 1998 with his prediction that Amazon 's stock would reach the unthinkable price of $400 a share . When the stock did , in fact , hit that level a month later , Blodget was hailed as an oracle . Shortly thereafter he moved to Merrill Lynch with a $3 million contract . There , he reigned as the single most visible adviser to investors hoping to score big in the Internet gold rush . Blond and affable , with telegenic good looks , Blodget was everywhere with his stock predictions as well as broader prognostications about the new economy . // What Blodget did n't mention to CNBC junkies or Merrill Lynch 's own clients was that his role at Merrill went far beyond analyzing stocks . Like other star analysts of the time , he also became deeply involved in Merrill 's investment banking business , helping to bring Internet companies-and fat underwriting fees-to Merrill . One of the companies Merrill 's investment banking division represented was Go2Net , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2000 . Merrill had a financial interest in InfoSpace 's stock price staying high so that the deal would go through . // Debases Kanjilal held on to his InfoSpace stock even as it declined steadily . Finally he sold at $11 a share and took a staggering loss . At the time Kanjilal sold , Merrill and Blodget were continuing to recommend InfoSpace to investors . Kanjilal 's losses were part of an estimated $4 trillion that investors lost when NASDAQ crashed . Big-name analysts hyped many sinking tech stocks with the same enthusiasm they 'd shown in pumping them up . For example , as of May 2001 , Morgan Stanley 's top Internet analyst , Mary Meeker , was still bestowing her once-coveted " outperform " rating on Priceline , then down from $162 to $4 , and on Yahoo ! , down from $237 to $19.50. // Kanjilal 's lawsuit against Merrill Lynch attracted the attention of Eliot Spitzer 's office not long after it was filed . Initiating a criminal investigation , Spitzer uncovered a shocking pattern of public deceit and conflict of interest at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculing the same stocks that he and Merrill were publicly pushing . " A piece of junk , " Blodget had called InfoSpace , even as he recommended it . He privately called other stocks a " pos , " or piece of shit . Spitzer also found a memo in which Blodget detailed the compensation he deserved for bringing in investment banking business-a memo that flatly contradicted Merrill 's claims that analysts were not rewarded for playing such a role . As a result of the investigation , Spitzer charged that Merrill Lynch 's " supposedly independent and objective investment advice was tainted and biased by the desire to aid Merrill Lynch 's investment banking business . " In Spitzer 's view , the behavior by Merrill and Blodget constituted securities fraud , a serious felony.1 // Spitzer 's evidence against Merrill Lynch resulted in the company agreeing to pay a $100 million settlement . This case turned out to be just the first step in a larger investigation of other top Wall Street firms that had engaged in a range of abuses by insiders , which culminated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Blodget ? Not much . Saying he wanted a " lifestyle change , " Blodget had accepted a November 2001 buyout offer from Merrill worth an estimated $5 million . He spent his days working on a book for Random House and meeting regularly with lawyers . In 2003 , Blodget settled with Spitzer 's office , agreeing to pay a $4 million penalty-yet admitting no wrongdoing . The settlement was easy enough to afford . Blodget had pulled in nearly $20 million during his brief star turn at Merrill . // HENRY BLODGET and the ATM looters have nothing in common and much in common . Blodget was among the ranks of the big winners in the new economy-the very top earners who saw unprecedented income gains during the boom of the 1990s . His education and background had helped him to secure his place in the Winning Class : successful parents , private schools , Yale University , connections on Wall Street . // The ATM looters , by contrast , were among the far larger ranks of Americans who had either stayed put economically or realized only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower rungs of what Robert Reich has called the Anxious Class , and the 1990s were not easy for them . Although median wages for workers near the bottom crept up in the latter part of the decade , these gains did not make up for wage losses since the late 1970s and , in any case , were wiped out by large increases in the cost of living across the New York area . Records from the DA 's office indicated that most of the ATM looters lived paycheck to paycheck with little money in the bank for emergencies . Some had average balances below $100 for months on end .
