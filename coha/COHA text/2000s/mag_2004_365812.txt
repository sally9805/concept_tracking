It 's only moments before takeoff when Tony Fernandes , CEO of high-flying budget airline AirAsia , rushes onto a plane destined for the Malaysian resort town of Kota Kinabalu . But there 's no plum seat waiting for him . Even top managers at no-frills airlines do n't get any frills . Fernandes treks through the crowded plane searching for an empty chair , ending up in one of the last rows . When flight attendants appear with a cart of sodas and instant noodles for sale , he plunks down 80 for a can of Milo chocolate drink . Fernandes then spends much of the two-hour journey chatting and shaking hands with each of the 140 passengers . After the plane touches down , he stands on the tarmac in his trademark red baseball cap , waves goodbye to the departing passengers and helps a team of baggage handlers unload suitcases from the cargo hold . <P> Fernandes would n't have it any other way . " I love it when I struggle to find a seat , " he says , beaming . With ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that right  --  seats have often been hard to find . Fernandes expects to fly 4 million passengers this year , twice as many as in 2003 . His success heralds a revolution in the airline industry in Asia . Although Americans and Europeans have benefited from low-cost air travel for years , tight regulation , powerful national-flag carriers and a dearth of airports have kept budget airlines at bay in Asia . But finally the region 's long-suffering travelers are able to join in . Five years ago , Asia had only one low-cost airline ; today there are 13 either already in the air or due to launch later this year . The boom is lowering airfares across the region , increasing competition for major airlines and making air travel accessible to tens of millions who otherwise could never have afforded to fly . <P> Fernandes , 40 , a fast-talking Malaysian , has become the poster child for the new movement . A 12-year veteran of Warner Music in Asia , Fernandes sold his pricey AOL Time Warner stock options and in 2001 bought into a sleepy two-plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is seeking to buy 80 more over the next eight years . AirAsia has gone from 12 flights a day to 100 , including runs from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta , from Bangkok to the gambling mecca of Macau and even flights to Bali . He 's also eyeing China and India . Boasts Fernandes : " We have transformed the way people think about flying . " <P> He 's not exaggerating . The cheap fares are luring Asians away from rickety buses , inefficient trains and traffic-choked highways . Laykha Boonlerd , 26 , a bank employee in Kuala Lumpur , could never before afford to fly to Bangkok to see her family and instead made an excruciating 24-hour pilgrimage by bus and train . But with a one-way ticket on AirAsia costing only $26 , she took wing in July for the first time . " I will travel much more with AirAsia , " she says . Indeed , about half the travelers on Asia 's budget airlines are first-time flyers like Boonlerd.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
