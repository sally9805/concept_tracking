( Third Class Superhero Got the letter today and guess what : still not a superhero . Dear Applicant , not a good sign , the number of qualified candidates this year blah blah far exceeded the number of available blah . I scan the list of people who did make it . A lot of them graduated with me . It 's the usual assortment of the strong and beautiful . About half are fireball shooters . A few are ice makers . Half a dozen telepath/ empaths . A couple of brutes , a shape-shifter , a few big brains . One thing they all have in common is that every single one of them can fly . I ca n't fly . I ca n't do much . On the other hand , it 's not like I 'm asking for a lot . I do n't need to be an all-star . I just want a suit and a cape , steady work , a paycheck that covers groceries . Decent health insurance . But I 'll have to wait another year . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Every morning , when I open my eyes , I think the same four thoughts : 1 ) I am not a superhero. 2 ) I have to go to work . 3 ) If I did n't have to work , I could be a superhero. 4 ) If I were a superhero , I would n't have to work . I was temping for a while to keep my afternoons free in case I got calls for tryouts , but those dried up and I needed to get a regular job for dental andvision . Now I 'm a records clerk for a big midtown law firm . I like it because I do n't have to talk to anyone or explain myself if I 'm missing for a few hours . I just say I was lost in the stacks . People at work do n't know I 'm moonlighting . They think I 'm an actor . * Part of the problem is my name . Moisture Man . Does n't exactly strike fear into the hearts of the wicked . For a few months last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atmosphero . A few people did it to be nice , but it did n't stick -- I think the problem was too many syllables . Shortening it to Atmos does n't work either , because there 's a physicist up in Seattle named Atomos who solves science crimes with a group that calls itself The Nucleus . The registrar says if I use too similar a name I could be sued for infringement . She suggested the name ' Sphero , but that 's just plain wrong . Makes me sound like a force-field guy , and , anyway , -o endings are usually for villains . So I 'm stuck with Moisture Man . A couple of years ago I listed myself in the phone book , which was a mistake , because you can imagine the crank calls I get . * My power , if you can call it that , and I do n't think you can , is that I am able to take about two gallons of water from the moisture in the air and shoot it in a stream or a gentle mist . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not all that helpful when trying to stop Carnage and Mayhem from robbing a bank . For years I was on a self-improvement kick . I read all the books and listened to tapes . I ordered everything there was to order by mail . Studied physics , how the big brains can change gravitational constants . I read history , I learned theory , the balance of good and evil , stuff like that . Still does n't change the fact that I 'm minor . Not even minor . A sideshow . A human water fountain . I did some time in therapy . Turns out , I have a self-destructive impulse and slight megalomania . I did n't need to pay for sixty hours of analysis to find that out . I still go to the gym , but I 'm getting old and I can only do so much . I read every word of Heroics for Dummies. $24.99 . Written by someone with an MBA . The quick bullet-point tip sheet at the back of the book tells me to " focus on my strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my weaknesses . " That 's helpful . * Evenings , I get home , open the junk mail , drink a warm beer . My refrigerator is unplugged and will probably stay that way forever . If I get hungry , there 's a twenty-four-hour taco stand across the street . Two for a dollar and free jalapenos if you eat there . I usually get four tacos and load up on salsa . After dinner , around ten or eleven , I go upstairs to sit with Henry . He lives in the one-room efficiency above me . He 's got a futon with a thin blanket , which I set up for him years ago . I do n't think he 's ever changed it from the couch position . He 's got one sink and a hot plate and a toilet room the size of a phone booth . Henry usually watches TV while I read the trades . Henry is eighty-something but looks closer to a hundred and forty . His skin smells like Naugahyde and his hair pops up from his head in clumps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two packs of Reds a day , but it got too expensive . In his life Henry has poured so much booze down his throat that if he never has another drink again he will be drunk the day he dies . He 's been smoked , cured , pickled , and I bet he 'll outlive me by twenty years . The way we met was this : When I moved in nine years ago , I used to hear loud banging and thumping noises from upstairs about once a week . I ignored it for a while , but one night it went on longer than usual . I went up there and knocked a few times , louder and louder . No one answered . It got quiet . I put on my costume and stood outside Henry 's door for a minute . I heard a whimper . I broke the door down -- I could do that kind of thing back then . Turns out it was Henry 's son , Harold , making all that noise . He had been beating the crap out of his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , until he got tired . Henry had been kicked out of the house by Harold 's mother thirty-five years earlier for the drinking , but instead of cleaning up his act , Henry just forgot about them and moved into this dump with his fifteen-inch television and ashtray and mini-fridge full of beer . Then Harold 's mother got sick and almost died trying not to go to the doctor . Her sister paid the hospital bills and practically raised Harold , and Harold turned out all right , went to college and got married and even had a son of his own , but he was still angry at Henry . Thing is , I believe Henry when he says he never laid a hand on anyone . I believe him , if only because Henry is the laziest person I 've ever met . He only wanted to destroy himself . Did his wife deserve better ? Did Harold ? Yes . Yes . Henry 's not a good guy . He 's getting the life he deserves and most days he seems okay with that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special powers , like Henry , who can just barely handle being normal . I do n't like the guy , but I guess I have a soft spot for him because he 's the only person I 've ever actually protected . Even though I did n't really do anything . It was just the costume . Since then , we 've become friends . Sort of . I look in on him a little . Just a little . Not as much as I should . I 'll regret it someday soon . It 's true . The only kinds of people in this metropolis are failed superheroes and the lonely old men who live upstairs from them . * I was n't always this way . Nine years ago , I was Young and Promising . I lived my life like I was waiting for some big event to happen . Not just a big event , but a Major Life Development . I had a lot of Capitalized Thoughts back then . I did some things I should n't have . I lived with about a six-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around me . I was going places , stepping on stones , burning bridges . I had a day job , but I looked around and said to myself out loud : You people are all lifers but I 'm just passing through . On my way to Big Things . Then that first letter came and I was n't on the list . A temporary setback . Until the next year , when I was n't on the list again . Burnham was . Dolan was . So was Feeney . Just a bump in the road , though . Until the next year . And then the next . And then four more years . I got used to it . This year , though , I thought something was different . This year , I could feel it . I even told a couple of people . I even admitted to myself that I was nervous . This year , things would turn around .
