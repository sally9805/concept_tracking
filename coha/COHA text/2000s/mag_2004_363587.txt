When Showtime premiered Queer as Folk , its series about horny gay men in Pittsburgh , Pa. , the title ( taken from the original British series ) was not meant to be subtle . ( This , kids , was way back in 2000 , before Carson Kressley rendered the word queer as humdrum as a Gap sweater . ) Now , unveiling a series about horny gay women in Los Angeles , the network is playing it more coy . The L Word ( Sundays , 10 p.m . E.T. ) , says its title sequence , is also about " liberty , " " life , " " love " and , presumably , llamas and lemonade too . The L Word , this implies , is about more than just lesbianism . <P> Which is correct . The problem is , those aspects of the show that are not about lesbianism are tedious , and those that are , are predictable . There are museum director Bette ( Jennifer Beals ) and her partner Tina ( Laurel Holloman ) , trying to conceive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , Tim ( Eric Mabius ) and Jenny ( Mia Kirshner ) , whose engagement is threatened when she falls for another woman . There 's tennis pro Dana ( Erin Daniels ) , terrified that her fans will find out she 's gay . Sure , it 's commendable even to pursue these obvious stories when lesbians have been less visible on TV than gay men . But commendable keeps your finger off the remote for only so long . <P> Perhaps Showtime hopes the sex , explicit and frequent , will help . Some advance buzz has even hailed the show 's well-coiffed , model-perfect cast for breaking lesbian stereotypes of buzz cuts and Birkenstocks . But anyone who thinks that improbably beautiful women who get it on under flattering light are not lesbian stereotypes has not watched much straight-male porn . <P> There is more to Word than pretty faces . Daniels , as the closet case gingerly entering the dating scene , has a likable awkwardness , and Pam Grier is convincing , if underused , as Bette 's 12-stepping half sister . The show is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern mores and the nuances of sexual power and identity . That makes it the more disappointing when it fails those ambitions . For instance , journalist Alice ( Leisha Hailey ) is compiling a massive online grid of sexual encounters to show how nearly everyone is connected by a chain of eros . " I think it 's a really profound statement , " she says , " about the nature of human existence . " <P> Sadly , the show treats this hackneyed **26;9807;TOOLONG observation like a major insight . Like Sex and the City , Word clearly wants to be a font of urban-sexual trend spotting , romantic wisdom and magazine-ready catchphrases . ( It ham-handedly drops words like hasbian  --  a former sapphist  --  as if to scream , " Look ! We 're cool ! We get it ! " ) But it could use more of Sex 's sense of irony . Instead it earnestly believes its most trite observations are brilliant revelations ; watching it is like spending an hour a week with an overconfident college sophomore . The L Word has lust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an L of a long way to go .  --  By James Poniewozik
