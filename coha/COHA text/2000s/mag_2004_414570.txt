WHEN THE STAMPEDING BUFFALO APPROACHED , THE BOY LOST HIS COURAGE . BUT THEN HE FOUND SOMETHING WITHIN HIMSELF MORE IMPORTANT THAN HUNTING SKILLS . // // THUMP ... THUMP ... THUMP , THUMP , THUMP . Cries-at-Moon could hear hooves pounding the ground through the earth . He lay next to his brother , River , hidden in tall grass . Far away , other hunters were circling the herd of buffalo and driving them in the direction of the two boys . Tastes-the-Wind , the leader of the Kitikiti'sh tribe , had shown them where to wait in a dry streambed . " The buffalo will run there , " Tastes-the-Wind said , pointing across a field . " You will have a chance with your arrows when they pass . " But River had insisted on crawling out into the field until they found a low spot that offered a little protection . " Now we have a real chance for a kill , " River said . Cries-at-Moon reached forward with a trembling hand and bent the grass down in front of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning light . He heard the distant hoots of the drivers spooking the buffalo , getting them on the move . River was busy testing an arrow in his bow . Cries-at-Moon watched the muscles tighten in River 's thin arms as he pulled the bowstring behind his ear . Each summer the buffalo appeared on the great grassy plain . The Kitikiti'sh lived year-round in their village of grass lodges that stood on a bluff above a meandering river . The hunters ventured out in the summer in search of the buffalo while others stayed behind to raise corn and gather food along the riverbanks . River was eager to face the buffalo , Cries-at-Moon thought , but this was no surprise . River had already taken his first buffalo . Their father had been so proud that day , marching River from lodge to lodge presenting his son . " Look at your brother , " his father had said . " He brings meat for our lodge . " Cries-at-Moon had burned with shame . He was a year older than his brother-he had lived through 12 summers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant events in their young lives . When River was small , the moving water of the river did not frighten him as it did other boys . He waded right in . He swam without being taught . So he was called River , a name of pride . Cries-at-Moon had not been so lucky . His name had come from the way he burst into tears whenever his mother brought him out of the lodge at night to see the stars . Cries-at-Moon jumped when River reached through the grass and grabbed his arm . " Today Father will be proud of you . You will see . We will both take a buffalo . I feel it . " Cries-at-Moon nodded . The rumble of the hooves was growing closer . He wiped his damp hand against his leather vest . Cries-at-Moon hoped his brother was right . The night before , circling the dancing post to the chant of the hunting song , he was sure he saw his father looking at him with disapproval . He had closed his eyes as he had been taught to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow and arrow , but instead he had relived the moment when his uncle had been killed the summer before . A huge bull had charged , catching his uncle full in the chest , tossing him aside like a straw in the wind . YOUR BOW ! " RIVER cried suddenly as he snatched up his own bow and fitted an arrow against the bowstring . " They 're coming ! " Cries-at-Moon reached for his bow . The thumping became louder . The ground shook . Cries-at-Moon saw the first buffalo dash over the horizon toward them . Then more dark shapes swarmed into view . Fear caught him like a coyote snatching up a rabbit . Cries-at-Moon could not stop himself . He dropped his bow and ran for the streambed . He turned just in time to see River jump to his feet . He had an arrow drawn in his bow and was trying to pick out one of the animals to shoot . Buffalo flew by him on either side . He let his arrow fly , but it went wide . River turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . The frantic noise of the rushing buffalo passed into the distance . Cries-at-Moon had n't moved . He sat amazed by the courage his brother had shown . If only he had such courage ! He collected his scattered arrows and went off in search of the arrow River had shot . The tall grass had swallowed it . He gave up and trudged off to find his brother . He had not gone far when he heard a grunting noise . He came up over a rise and discovered a steep drop-off . The same streambed where he and River had been hiding curved here and had formed a high bank . At the bottom was an enormous buffalo lying on its side and shaking all over . Cries-at-Moon climbed down cautiously , afraid the animal would leap up and try to crush him . But as he came closer , he saw that the buffalo 's front leg had been broken in the fall from the bank . It was an old bull . Dirt was caked in layers on its matted hide . Its muzzle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pain radiating from the great animal like heat from a campfire . He moved closer and found that his own fear had left him . he walked up and placed a hand on the animal 's broad shoulder . With a kick of its good leg , the buffalo might have broken him in half , but Cries-at-Moon did not think of this . He whispered to the buffalo . " Quiet , Old One , " he said . " You 've had bad luck here , but you 've also had a long life , have n't you ? " Cries-at-Moon met the gaze of the buffalo 's dark brown eye . It seemed as if he and the animal were old friends . The boy closed his eyes . In his mind he was a buffalo running beside the old bull . He saw the grass sweeping by underneath him . He felt the warm sun on his shoulders . Now his face was down in the grass and he was tearing it up , eating it . Flies buzzed by his ears . He felt himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs in the air . When he opened his eyes , the buffalo had calmed and was no longer shaking . Cries-at-Moon understood what he must do . From his waist strap , he pulled out his flint knife . He ran his hand over the fur on the buffalo 's neck , finding his spot , and then thrust the knife as hard as he could into the hide below the jaw . The buffalo jerked but did not struggle . Warm blood poured from the wound over Cries-at-Moon 's hand . The light soon left the buffalo 's eye . Its head rested on the ground . Cries-at-Moon wept to see his friend die . " WHAT IS THIS ? " CRIES-AT-Moon 's father was looking down at him from the stream bank . River was with him and Tastes-the-Wind as well . " Look ! " River yelled . " Cries-at-Moon has made a kill . I knew he would become a hunter today . " Cries-at-Moon straightened up . " No , " he said . " My friend was badly hurt . I only did what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tastes-the-Wind stepped forward . " How is that ? Your friend ? Wanting to die ? How did you know this ? " Cries-at-Moon looked at Tastes-the-Wind with surprise . " My friend ... urn ... yes ... it was as if he spoke to me . I understood . " Tastes-the-Wind stared at the boy for a moment and then said to Cries-at-Moon 's father , " The boy will walk back to camp with me . I must learn more about this . " His father began to speak , but Tastes-the-Wind held up his hand . " It is decided . " SO TASTES-THE-WIMD AND Cries-at-Moon walked off together . The boy explained to Tastes-the-Wind how it had been with the buffalo , how he understood . Then he told Tastes-the-Wind about other things he understood . " When the coyotes howl at night , I know they are lonely . They are searching for each other . They yelp with joy when they find each other . I know some of them by name . I understand the birds when they sing and the crickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to us as we passed by . He asked about his mate . I never told anyone about understanding when the animals speak . I thought it was silly . I thought others would laugh . " Tastes-the-Wind listened patiently . When the boy finished , he placed his hand on Cries-at-Moon 's shoulder and said , " This is a wonderful gift you have . Tonight we will sit together and tell stories of today 's hunt . Your story will be one of them . Perhaps you can become a storyteller and fill our hearts with the wisdom you learn from the animals . " They walked on for a while in silence . Then Tastes-the-Wind said , " Your father will be very proud . " // Sidebar " QUIET , OLD ONE , " CRIES-AT-MOON WHISPERED TO THE BEAST .
