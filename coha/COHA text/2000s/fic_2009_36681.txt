Georgia  --  Present Day <p> Despite the hundreds of years that John Nightwalker had been on this earth , he had yet to feel completely comfortable wearing clothes . And from the look the female bank teller was giving him as he stood in line at the First Savannah Savings and Loan to cash a check , she would have been perfectly happy to help him strip . <p> John felt her gaze but was ignoring all the signals . Not only was he not in the mood for dallying with a stranger , she was wearing a wedding ring  --  a big no-no for him . He shifted from one foot to the other , then looked down at the two little boys clinging to the legs of the woman in front of him and grinned . The oldest one smiled back , while the younger one continued the exploration of his right nostril with his index finger . <p> " Hi , " the older one said . " My name is Brandon Dog-gett . " He pointed toward the little guy . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he pointed at his mother 's backside , which John had already noticed was quite shapely . " That 's my mama . Her name is Doggett , too . " <p> When Mama Doggett realized her name was being bandied about , she glanced over her shoulder to see who her son was talking to . Her eyes widened slightly as she saw John Nightwalker 's face . The smooth coffee skin , high cheekbones , strong chin and nose were telling of his Native American heritage , but it was the sexy smile and glint in his eyes that stopped her breath . She might be married , but she was n't dead and the man was stunning . <p> " I hope the boys are n't bothering you , " she said . <p> John grinned . " No , ma'am . " <p> " Daddy calls her Lisa , " Brandon offered . <p> Lisa Doggett rolled her eyes as John chuckled . <p> The low , husky rumble of his laugh made the female teller lose count of the cash she 'd been dispensing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she began again . <p> Lisa Doggett , being next in line , finally reached the teller and proceeded with her business . When they were done , the teller handed each little boy a lollipop , which they promptly peeled and popped into their mouths . Lisa flashed John a shy goodbye smile and started toward the front door with her sons in tow . <p> Being next in line , John moved up to the window , patiently waiting as the teller keyed in some data from her previous customer . There was a moment of silence  --  a soft , peaceful sound of shuffling feet and the distant murmurs between loan officers and their clients  --  then John felt the atmosphere change . To him , the room was suddenly stifling and charged with an anger he did n't understand . <p> " Sir . How can I help you ? " the teller asked , but John did n't respond . <p> His gaze went from Lisa Doggett and her boys , who were on their way toward the exit , to the surrounding customers waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , then turned around and ran . John noticed a toy car in the middle of the lobby and figured it had fallen out of a pocket . He saw the mother 's irked expression turn to one of quiet patience as she waited for her son 's return . <p> His attention moved from them to the rest of the crowd . At first glance , no one stood out , and then his gaze fell on a tall , heavyset man standing in line on the other side of the lobby . He was wearing a pair of faded Levi 's and a heavy denim jacket . The jacket seemed out of place , considering the outside temperature was in the high eighties . That alone immediately set him apart . The man 's lower jaw jutted from his face like a bulldog 's  --  a strong protruding lower jaw that extended beyond the tip of a nose that had obviously been broken more than once . His skin was ruddy , his hair a brittle yellow color . John could feel the tension emanating from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed it would n't be good . <p> As he continued to watch , the big man headed toward a teller , walked up to the window and slid what appeared to be a white cotton bag across the counter . It looked like an ordinary deposit bag , but when the teller 's face turned pale and her eyes widened in shock , John tensed . <p> He could see the man 's lips moving , but he was too far away to hear what was being said . All of a sudden the teller 's eyes rolled back in her head as she dropped to the floor in a faint . Everyone heard the thud as her head collided with the hard marble floor . The teller next to her screamed out for help as everything ground to a halt . <p> Wallace Deeds cursed beneath his breath , unable to believe what had just happened . In all the years he 'd been doing this , he 'd never had anyone faint on him before . He was a criminal , but he was n't stupid . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note he 'd handed to the teller and calmly walk out of the building . To his dismay , the note was no longer on the counter . It was on the floor beside the unconscious woman . <p> " Crap , " Wallace muttered , and slid his hand in his pocket , taking comfort from the gun he could feel inside . He glanced up and around , quickly sizing up the number of people inside the bank against his need for dough . He opted for a hasty exit . <p> But his plan was screwed by a secretary who 'd come to the unconscious teller 's aid . She was on her knees beside the woman and feeling for a pulse when she discovered the note . <p> I have a gun . Put all your money in the bag and keep quiet or you 're a dead woman . <p> Unaware that he 'd been made , Deeds was already heading toward the door when the secretary stood up and screamed . <p> " Stop him ! He has a gun ! " <p> Wallace cursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol and coming toward him on the run . Without thinking , Wallace grabbed the nearest customer by the arm and put her in a choke hold as he pulled out his own gun and fired a shot into the ceiling . <p> " Everyone on the floor ! Now ! " he screamed . <p> The bank guard stood his ground , still aiming his weapon and shouting , " Drop the gun ! Drop it ! Drop it and let her go ! " <p> John groaned . The hostage was none other than Lisa Doggett , the young woman with the two little boys who 'd been in line in front of him . <p> Bad move . Bad , bad move . <p> The young mother 's panic was evident as she cast a frantic , wild-eyed gaze at her little boys . Trevor , the youngest , began to cry and started toward her . <p> " Do n't anybody move ! " Wallace roared , waving the gun at the guard , then at the kids and back again . <p> John knew the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he meant to or not , and Trevor Doggett 's determination to get to his mother was putting him in harm 's way . There was no time for John to think about the wisdom of his actions . <p> In one swift move , he pulled a knife from his boot and leaped forward , desperate to draw the gunman 's attention away from the boys , his hostage and the guard with the gun , knowing full well that he was going to get shot . Knowing full well it was going to hurt like hell  --  but it was n't going to kill him . <p> That was the edge he had over everyone else in the room . He 'd faced death and cheated it countless times over the last five hundred years and had every confidence in the world that he was going to cheat it again . <p> When Wallace Deeds saw the movement from the corner of his eye , he swung his pistol . A man was coming at him on the run . <p> " Son of a bitch ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight into John 's chest . He felt the impact and a sharp , searing pain , but he did n't go down . <p> When Deeds ' hostage fainted and went limp , she became a liability instead of a shield . Disgusted , he shoved her aside and squeezed off another shot . But it was the knife suddenly protruding from his chest that sent his second shot into the ceiling next to the first . <p> A collective gasp rose from inside the bank , followed by a silence so stark that everyone froze . <p> Lisa Doggett had come to and was on her knees , shielding her children with her body . <p> The tellers had ducked behind the counter . <p> The people who 'd dropped to their bellies when the shooting started were staring but not moving . <p> No one ran . <p> No one spoke . <p> But the ones who could see were staring in disbelief at the two giants standing in the middle of the lobby  --  both bleeding profusely  --  waiting to see who dropped first . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the bone handle of the knife stuck in his chest . But the moment he touched it , he shuddered . Had someone poured hot oil into his chest ? He looked up . People 's faces were blurring . <p> " How " He sighed , then staggered backward . <p> John groaned as he put a hand to his own chest . The warm gush of his blood was already slowing as he watched the gunman fall . Wallace 's head hit the tile with a sickening crack , but he never felt it . He was already dead . <p> The bank guard holstered his weapon and started toward John . <p> Lisa Doggett was shaking , but she was alive and her children were safe . <p> People were getting up and yanking out their cell phones , anxious to tell their loved ones what had just happened . While on his belly , one customer had videoed the whole thing with his cell phone , and now he was in the act of forwarding it to his brother . The image of what had transpired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horace Miles , the bank president , was moving through the crowd , making sure everyone was okay . When he saw the blood on the front and back of John 's shirt , he gasped and yelled for someone to call 911 . <p> John was anxious to be gone before he had to explain why the bullet hole in his chest was already nearly closed . He pulled his knife out of the robber 's chest , then wiped the blood off the blade onto the man 's jacket before slipping it back into the sheath inside his boot . <p> The bank guard reached John and took him by the elbow . <p> " You need to sit down , son , " he said . " You 've been shot . " <p> " I 'm okay , " John said . <p> " The police are coming ! " someone said . <p> Sirens could be heard in the distance . John sighed . He needed to leave  --  now . He started toward the door , but Horace Miles cut him off . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to usher him to a chair . <p> " Please , " Miles said . " You 're bleeding . Let us help you . " <p> " I 'm all right really . " <p> But the bank president would have none of it . <p> Lisa Doggett came toward him , hugging her little boys to her legs as she stared at him in disbelief . <p> " You saved my life . You saved all of us , " she whispered . " Thank you . Thank you . " <p> " Yeah sure , " he said , then gave in to the inevitable . He was caught now , and there was no way out of it . <p> The two little boys stared at him  --  silent now in the face of what they 'd witnessed . <p> " Mama 's okay , boys , " John said softly . <p> Brandon nodded . " You stopped the bad man , " he said . <p> John just winked and nodded . The pain in his chest was fading swiftly , but the sirens were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars were on the scene , followed by two ambulances . A paramedic team followed the police inside , then , at the guard 's direction , headed for John . <p> He sighed . How the hell was he going to explain his way out of this ? <p> " I 'm okay , " he said as the paramedics dropped their bags and began to cut off his shirt . " I said I 'm okay , " he repeated , and to prove he was right , he pulled up his shirt , revealing the wound that was almost closed . <p> Both paramedics rocked back on their heels , staring at John and then at each other . <p> " Mister how in  --  " <p> " Er uh I studied with the Dalai Lama , " John said . <p> " Learned how to control bleeding and heal myself with my mind . Ever hear of it ? " <p> They looked at each other , shrugged , and then began packing up their gear while sneaking curious looks at him . <p> But they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shock . He 'd seen the bullet pierce John 's chest , seen the blood spurting , yet now the wound was nearly closed . He 'd seen the other scars on John 's chest , too , and was staggered by what this man had suffered and lived through . <p> Just when John was getting ready to leave , a skinny man in a suit followed several uniformed officers into the bank , paused long enough to question the guard , then headed straight for John , who recognized the type , as well as the badge clipped to the man 's belt . <p> Great . A detective . Naturally nosy , disinclined to believe anything he was told . This ought to be good . <p> John saw him pause to look at the dead man ; then he looked straight at John , who stared back without flinching . <p> Horace Miles stepped into the silent breach by introducing himself as the cop approached . <p> " I 'm Horace Miles , president of the bank . I saw everything . " <p> " Detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands on his hips and gave John the once-over , eyeing the bloody shirt as well as the blood on John 's jeans . " So , hero , what 's your name ? " <p> Sarcasm was the last thing John expected . It made him angry . He stood abruptly , well aware that he was now towering over the skinny man 's head . <p> " Considering the fact that right now , my chest hurts like hell , I do n't appreciate your sarcasm , " he drawled . " My name is John Nightwalker , and I 'm not a hero . I was just in the wrong place at the right time . " <p> Lee wanted to be pissed , but the man was right . " Sorry , " he said . " That came out wrong . Let 's back up and do this all over again . So , Mr. Nightwalker , could you tell me what happened ? " <p> John pointed to the walls where a half-dozen cameras were mounted . " I could but it appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angles on the incident for your viewing pleasure . Suffice it to say , the man tried to rob the bank , took a woman hostage and was pointing his gun at one of her kids . I distracted him . He shot me instead of the kid . I put a knife in his chest . " <p> Believing John had already been tended by paramedics , Lee 's next thought was the weapon in question . " May I see that knife ? " <p> John winced as he leaned over , pulled up the leg of his jeans , then pulled the knife back out of its scabbard . <p> The detective 's eyes widened and his mouth dropped as he eyed the wicked blade . It was almost ten inches in length , with its widest point no less than three inches across . The handle appeared to be some kind of bone  --  maybe ivory . He frowned . <p> " Hell , mister , that thing 's big enough to fight bears with . " <p> " Yes . " <p> Startled by the easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't tell me you fight bears , too ? " <br> Continues ...
