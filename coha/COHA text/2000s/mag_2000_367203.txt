" You 're an almost perfect specimen of the genus ' peach , ' " says dashing reprobate Rowley Flint ( Sean Penn ) to the truly peachy Mary Pantin ( Kristin Scott Thomas ) in this stilted version of a Somerset Maugham trifle about the moneyed class inconvenienced by lust and Fascism in 1938 Florence .
