Bankers fear her . Treasury officials hate her . Can Elizabeth Warren really keep track of how $700 billion in taxpayer money is being spent ? Do n't let my politeness fool you , " says Elizabeth Warren . The Harvard Law professor and head of the congressional panel monitoring the bank bailout had just finished a hearing in New York City and was nibbling at a dish of pasta with zucchini . " I ca n't think of anyone I 'm afraid of , " she adds . " Certainly not someone who may have had a hand in bringing this country to the brink of disaster . " Warren , 59 , is exceedingly polite . She has strong opinions , but she often expresses them in a whisper-soft voice . She tends to say " Does that make sense ? " in her Oklahoma drawl right after she finishes answering a question . During the hearing , which was focused on the federal bailout program 's effect on corporate and commercial real estate lending , Warren gingerly tapped her gavel from the dais . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order , " she said a bit hesitantly . As part of her new job , this well-mannered career academic has to bully some of the world 's most powerful men . Shortly after Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act last October , Warren was appointed by Senate Democrats to do one of the most difficult , or perhaps impossible , jobs in Washington : chairing a bipartisan panel tasked with scrutinizing how the Treasury Department -- first George W. Bush 's , now Barack Obama's -- is spending the $700 billion in federal money intended in large part to shore up failing banks . The role has Warren monitoring the decisions of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and the big-bank CEOs who have taken taxpayer money to clean up companies ' balance sheets . If Warren 's journey from Harvard to the center of the emergency financial-rescue effort were a movie , it could be called Out of the Library and into the Snake Pit . Her appointment raises a number of questions , including whether someone like Warren can compel staffers at the Treasury Department to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonus scandal at AIG , the former insurance giant that is now a ward of the Federal Government , was a strong indication that some of those responsible for dispensing funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) lost track of the cash . Which raises a more philosophical point : Is it even possible to know where the money is going ? And if so , is Warren , a Washington outsider who 's still feeling her away around a strange new landscape , the right person to figure it out ? Follow the Money If the question hinges on whether Warren can say exactly how TARP money has been spent so far , then the answer is probably no -- but then that may be an unrealistic goal . The eight monthly reports released by the oversight panel to date spend almost more time talking about what is n't known than about what is . They repeatedly assert that the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve should be more forthcoming . The panel has been plagued by controversy , which has also hampered its effectiveness . Its two Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core mission under Warren 's leadership and spends too much time editorializing on the plight of middle-class families , the focus of Warren 's academic research . Her relationship with Treasury has been rocky . She got into a low-level war with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and his staff over their perceived unwillingness to share information , and she had a shaky start with Geithner , who did n't seem to take the panel seriously at first . In an " Additional View " filed with the panel 's June report , Republican panel member Jeb Hensarling wrote , " By choosing to focus much of its work on issues not central to our mandate the panel has missed critical opportunities to provide effective oversight . " From a public relations perspective , though , Warren has been a success . She has taken to the spotlight like a seal to water and has smoothly made the cable-TV rounds to chide the close-knit club that determined financial policy in the past . She argues that now , finally , taxpayers " have a seat at the table . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Party bosses had in mind when they selected her . Since a special inspector general was also appointed to investigate Treasury 's actions , Warren 's oversight panel was left with little actual power . But it performs a much more public function . Though some of the panel 's reports have been less than revelatory , there have been some worthy and newsmaking insights , like the suggestion that for every $100 Paulson spent buying stakes in troubled banks , the government received assets worth only $66 . The panel 's most recent report , released June 9 , concludes that the government 's " stress tests " of banks should be repeated under more stringent conditions in the future . In recent days , 10 top banks have begun to repay some $68 billion in TARP funds . According to Warren , knowing exactly what happened to money spent under TARP is less important than simply keeping the pressure on . " We certainly have n't achieved perfect transparency , " she says . When asked whether it was even possible to determine what happened to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " It 's a wonderful irony , is n't it ? Once Paulson gave this money away on a no-strings basis , it became effectively impossible to trace it . " But , she says , it wo n't happen again : " It 's a $300 billion mistake that we will not repeat . " Warren 's concern for the middle class is the prism through which she sees every economic indicator . It is also the driving force behind her work with the oversight panel . The first two reports it issued , in December and January , criticized Paulson 's department for its lack of transparency and argued that its policies were doing little to help reduce home foreclosures or alleviate stress on families . Even if accurate , those early pronouncements did not help to pave the way to a functional working relationship between Warren and the people she was supposed to oversee . Former Treasury officials seem to despise her and complain that Warren is only trying to advance her own agenda by using the panel for -- gasp !  - -  social good . " When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and communicate and then goes out and gives interviews , it becomes clear this is going to be an antagonistic relationship , " says a former Treasury official . " She 's coming at this in terms of a gotcha approach . " Warren 's dealings with Geithner hit some bumps early on too . After he took office , the panel requested for months that Geithner testify before it ; he ignored the request at first but eventually relented . " The most generous interpretation would be that he was staggeringly busy , and to be well prepared for a hearing takes time , " Warren says of Geithner , who testified in April . " The less generous interpretation would be that ... we were not on the best of terms . " She insists that things are now going more smoothly . When asked what the biggest challenge is , in terms of getting important data , former New Hampshire Senator John Sununu , the second Republican on the panel , pauses for a long time . " Working with Treasury is like working with any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking to the right person and have a good relationship with them , you can get access to information in a timely way . If you 're not successful at making your request a priority for them , it may take a while . " Mrs. Smith Goes to Washington Warren was an unlikely choice to head the oversight panel , not least because of her lack of familiarity with Washington parlor games . Her academic specialty is bankruptcy law , especially as it pertains to the American middle class . She emerged on the public stage in 2003 , when she published the book The Two-Income Trap : Why Middle-Class Parents Are Going Broke , co-authored with her daughter . The book argues that women and middle-class couples were driving themselves to ruin trying to buy houses in good public-school districts : " Having a child is now the single best predictor that a woman will end up in financial collapse . " The ensuing media frenzy led to Warren 's testifying a few times on Capitol Hill , where she caught the eye of Senate majority leader Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's short list , Warren says , " I took away from the conversation that my presence was about American families having a stake in the outcome of these powerful decisions that are being made . So I 've never apologized for caring about and raising issues that relate directly to them . " As Washington debates how to reshape the regulatory system to prevent economic shocks in the future , Warren hopes to see some of her ideas translate into policy changes . And she vows to continue as long as Congress will have her . " I 'm not hanging on to this job . I 'm here at the pleasure of the Senate that appointed me , " she says . " But having said that , I 'm not looking over my shoulder . I 'm here to do what I think is right . " PULLQUOTE ' I 'm not looking over my shoulder . I 'm here to do what I think is right . '  - -  WARREN , ON HER ROLE AS HEAD OF THE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT PANEL BOX Tracking TARP Treasury has spent billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far The following text appears within a chart . Please see hardcopy or PDF for actual chart . Banks $270 billion New Initiatives $124 billion Public-Private Investment Program $100 billion Automakers And Suppliers $85 billion AIG $70 billion Consumer and Business Lending Initiative $70 billion Homeowners $50 billion BOX The Big TARP Riddles . Three questions for Warren 's panel 1 Is TARP helping revive the economy ? The first $350 billion , released in October , may have prevented a total meltdown . The second , released in January , propped up homeowners , automakers and AIG . Says economist Mark Zandi : " Without TARP we would have seen a more complete collapse of the financial system . " 2 Does the government know how the money is being spent ? Yes and no . The first $200 billion or so disappeared into the banks . The money improved their balance sheets , but most banks refused to reveal how they used the cash . TARP funds that went to automakers , consumer loans and mortgage modifications are easier to track . 3 Will the TARP money ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is being returned . Treasury announced that 10 large banks , including Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and American Express , will repay $68 billion in coming days . Billions more given to such companies as AIG and GM may never be recouped.
