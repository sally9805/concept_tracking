SCOUTS VIEWS BEARS As long as their starters stay healthy , they have a good chance to repeat as division champs . ... It seems to me Thomas Jones carried their offense-emotionally and physically-for the greater part of last year . They might run into some issues chemistrywise if Cedrlc Benson is anointed the starter instead of actually beating him out .... The line play really is what sets the tempo for the defense . Those guys get off the ball quick , which allows Brian Urlacher and Lance Briggs to get to the ball . VIKINGS There 's a learning curve to Brad Childress ' offense . I think it takes some time to develop . Until they get a couple games into the season and everyone is on the same page , I think they 're going to struggle .... I 've always been a Pat Williams fan . If he plays at the level he did last year , he quietly gives them a playmaker at defensive tackle .... Steve Hutchinson was a good addition at guard . He 's strong , with good balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , you do n't see that man slipping off and making many plays . LIONS I think Mike Martz will open up the field for that offense . You 'll see a lot more 15- to 20-yard passes to those big receivers . ... The strength of their team is probably the front four on defense . They have a lot of versatility , a lot of talented athletes .... The guy who 's kind of been forgotten in the whole deal is Kevin Jones . He might be the X-factor . PACKERS Brett Favre still has it-without a doubt . If you 're an opposing team and he 's within striking distance in the fourth quarter , you 've got to go , " Uh-oh . " ... I do n't think anyone knows what Robert Ferguson will do week in and week out at receiver . He 's a work in progress .... They 'll miss Ryan Longwell-immensely . There are n't many guys who know how to kick in the elements like he does . The Vikings ' defensive line again will benefit from Williams ' silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 Vikings 8-8 3 Lions 7-9 4 Packers 4-12 1 Chicago BEARS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : The Bears won 11 games last season with rookie QB Kyle Orton as the primary starter ; they expect to improve with Rex Grossman running the show and Brian Griese backing him up . Grossman can push the ball downfield to WR Muhsln Muhammad . Improving a passing attack that averaged just 125.1 yards per game will open running lanes for RBs Thomas Jones and Cedric Benson . Jones is expected to be the team 's opening day starter , but Benson will be worked into the offense after he returns from a shoulder injury and eventually could earn the starting job with strong play . The offensive line is a strength , led by five-time Pro Bowl C Olin Kreutz . MLB Brian Urlacher , the reigning defensive player of the year , is in his prime . DT Tommie Harris is becoming a force ; opposing offensive lines have to scheme to stop him . The division again is shaky because the three other NFC North teams have new coaching staffs . REASONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries two straight years , so relying on him is risky . SS Mike Brown was shut down after the first exhibition game because of a strained left Achilles'tendon . The company line was that it simply was a precautionary measure . Losing him for any amount of time would be devastating ; the Bears are not the same team without their emotional leader . CB Charles Tillman remains an enigma . Teams with prolific passing games , such as Cincinnati and Carolina , lit up the secondary at times last season , and Tillman seemed to have confidence issues . If he does n't become more consistent , the defense will have a hole to fill . BIGGS ' BOTTOM LINE : What the organization discovered in Grossman 's absence was it has a Super Bowl-ready defense and dependable running game , two elements needed for a deep playoff run . Expectations have not been this high since Mike Ditka stalked the Soldier Field sideline . A division title is likely , but a trip to the Super Bowl will depend on whether the offense-led by Grossman or Griese-is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 LT John Tait 4 LG Ruben Brown 3 C Olin Kreutz RG Roberto Garza 3 RT Fred Miller 3 TE Desmond Clark 2 WR Muhsin Muhammad 3 QR Rex Grossman 2 FB Jason McKie 1 RB Thomas Jones DEFENSE LE Adewale Ogunleye 5 DT Tommie Harris 5 DT Ian Scott 3 RE Alex Brown 4 OLB Hunter Hillenmeyer 3 MLB Brian Urlacher 5 OLB Lance Briggs 5 CB Charles Tillman 2 CB Nathan Vasher 4 SS Mike Brown 4 FS Chris Harris 2 PECIALISTS K Robbie Could 3 P Brad Maynard 4 KR Rashied Davis 2 PR Devin Hester 3 LS Patrick Mannelly 5 Players rated 1-5 , with 5 highest SNAPSHOT with OLB Lance Briggs Weirdest pregame ritual : Brendon Ayanbadejo really likes to rub a whole lot of cream all over his arms and chest .

" and it 's funny because he has that high-pitched voice . " You need Jesus ! " he yells in the middle of an argument . Usually , the guy gets stuck or else he responds , " I have Jesus ! " Most wired : Bob Babich ( linebackers coach ) . He 's always flailing . No one flails better than him . He 's fired up in the meeting room-he seems like he 's always on caffeine . We used to have a deal where if he blurted something out during practice , we 'd mark it on the board . He 'd blurt something out to help a player . It could be , " You got ta get back .

You 've got to have a death wish if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OPTIMISM : Expect the offensive line to be much better . In training camp , LG Steve Hutchinson was every bit the mauler the team had hoped he would be . LT Bryant McKinnie , despite a fractured finger in his right hand , appeared to mesh well with Hutchinson . C Matt Birk is healthy after missing last season ( torn labrum ) . QB Brad Johnson is perfect for this situation . He won a Super Bowl running an offense similar to this one . Johnson has been accurate in the short game . His experience qualifies him as a coach on the field . Assuming he stays healthy , he gives the team a good chance to win . A new , aggressive cover 2 scheme will maximize the skills of a talented defensive line . Ts Pat Williams and Kevin Williams can create havoc inside . Es Erasmus James and Kenechl Udeze have been given simple instructions : Get upfield . REASONS FOR CONCERN : Depth at receiver is a big concern , especially after the team cut No. 1WR Karen Robinson . The pressure is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to be a top-flight receiver . IravisTaylor is a solid possession receiver but wo n't scare anyone deep . The team 's best receiver might be TE Jermaine Wlgglns . The linebacker position still is uncertain despite a strong training camp by OLB EJ . Henderson.The seasonending knee injury suffered by rookie Chad Greenway further depleted the depth of the unit . Newcomer Ben Leber rarely makes mistakes but did n't make many big plays during camp , and MLB Napoleon Harris never has been a reliable full-time starter . SEIFERT 'S BOTTOM LINE : The team has improved in some areas , including at offensive line and running back , but its talent has eroded at other positions . Coach Brad Chlldress has run an organized camp and preseason , and his team is expected to have the mettle to grind out wins in close games . Still , it figures to be difficult for the team to improve on last season 's 9-7 record . - Kevin Seifert STARTING LINEUP OFFENSE WR Troy Williamson 2 LT Bryant McKinnie 4 LG Steve Hutchinson 5 C MAtt Birk 3 RG Artis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WR Travis Taylor 3 QB Brad Johnson 3 FB Tony Richardson 3 RB Chester Taylor 3 DEFENSE LE Erasmus James 3 DT Kevin Williams 3 DT Pat Williams 4 RE Kenechi Udeze 2 OLB Ben Leber 2 MLB Napoleon Harris 2 OLB E.J.

He 'll get anybody at any time . I remember seeing him put some bikes on the roof of a dorm room last year . NFL Initiation : In my rookie year , we were playing Houston and Mr. Robaire Smith came from behind me and hit me in the back when I was running the ball . He hit me so hard that it was like he pushed my back to my front . Cheapest teammate : Some guys would probably say me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Ciatrick Fason , Daddy Fason , he 's right up there with me . Road trip I like most : Green Bay . I mean , how can a guy who loves football not love playing at Lambeau Field ? Funniest trash-talker : I would say Jermaine Wiggins . He 's from Boston , and he 's always talking about the Red Sox and everything else having to do with Boston . Favorite way to spend my day off : Sleeping . I do n't know an NFL player who would n't tell you that . Nobody knows this about the Metrodome : If you have n't played there , you 'll think it 's a rock concert when you get in there . 3 Detroit LIONS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : When you combine the hands of WR Roy Williams with the legs of RB Kevin Jones and the brains of coordinator Mike Martz , good things are going to happen . The Lions will be much more explosive on offense , and Martz will lean on the two stars in an effort to create opportunities for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plays smart , but his greatest quality is his leadership . New coach Rod Marinelll 's defensive line expertise will take the line from good to dominant . Look forT Shaun Rogers to remain a standout and be more consistent . Everyone else on the line will benefit from Marinelli 's teaching skills , especially E Kalimba Edwards , who must become a better pass-rushing threat . REASONS FOR CONCERN : Teams that switch to a disciplined one-gap defensive system often start slowly because it 's a tough scheme to execute . When a gap is opened , it usually results in a big play and gets an offense cranked up . Three key players in the new defense-Rogers and LBs Boss Bailey and Teddy Lehman-are behind in executing the system because they 've missed almost all of training camp with injuries . The team has issues at cornerback . Ore ' Bly has to bounce back from a subpar season . Fernando Bryant is the other starter mostly by default . When healthy , he has n't performed to expectations . The Lionsperhaps more than upgrading their talent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's easier said than done . After five straight seasons of double-digit losses , many of these players do n't know what it takes to be winners in the NFL . KOWALSKI 'S BOTTOM LIKE : The Lions will be playoff contenders soon . The only question is whether it will be this season . With a new coach bringing in new and complicated offensive and defensive systems-both are proven winning strategies , by the way-it 's going to take time for the Lions to absorb and execute them properly . But the talent is there on both sides of the football . - Tom Kowalski STARTING LINEUP OFFENSE WR Roy Williams 4 LT Jeff Backus 4 LG Ross Verba 3 C Dominic Raiola 3 RT Rex Tucker 2 TE Casey FitzSimmons 3 WR Corey Bradford3 QB Jon Kitna 3 FB Cory Schlesinger 3 RB Kevin Jones 3 DEFENSE LE Cory Redding 3 DT Shaun Cody 2 DT Shaun Rogers 5 RE James Hall 3 OLB Ernie Sims 3 MLB Boss Bailey 3 OLB Teddy Lehman 3 CB Fernando Bryant 2 CB Dre ' Bly 3 SS Kenoy Kennedy 3 FS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris 5 KR Eddie Drummond 4 PR Eddie Drummond 4 LS Don Muhlbach 4 Players rated 1-5 , with 5 highest SNAPSHOT with WR Roy Williams Beware of this guy In the locker room : Dominic Raiola . He 's the prankster ; and he does n't wear a towel ... to anything . My body on Monday morning : I 'm like a 78-year-old man . I take itty-bitty steps in the morning , and it 's very ugly . I 'm glad I 'm the only one there . Road trip I like most : Going back to Dallas . It 's going back home and it 's Texas Stadium , the ring of honor , the history . Unique vanity plate : Daniel Bullocks has a Mercedes S550 and his plate says " DMAN , " but I do n't know if it means Da Man or Daniel Man or Defensive Man . Can't-miss weekly dining tradition : Pizza Hut on Monday night . I tune in with a large stuffed crust . I have it delivered . Most memorable slobberknocker : ( Dallas ' ' ) Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he looked at me and gave the " horns down " as he stood over him . They came and got Tai off the field . The " horns down " thing is something ( Oklahoma ) does ( to Texas players ) . It 's disrespect . Most wired : Both coordinators , especially Mike Martz . I 've never heard so many f-bombs come out of somebody 's mouth . He wants it done right-and if you do n't do it right , you 'll do it right the next time , I 'll promise you that . 4 Green Bay PACKERS REASONS FOR OPTIMISM : QB Brett ferne appears to have taken to new coach Mike McCarthy 's system , which is similar to what Favre ran under former coach Mike Holmgren . Favre seems willing to accept McCarthy 's demand to be smart with the ball . Look for Favre to fling the ball downfield less and change plays based on the defensive alignment more often . If CB Al Harris plays as well as he did last year and CB Charles Woodson stays healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-to-man coverage and allow coordinator Bob Sanders to blitz when he wants and play zone coverage in the middle of the field . Rookie AJ . Hawk and second-year pro Brady Popplnga will improve the speed at outside linebacker . If the defensive tackles can occupy blockers , Hawk , Poppinga and MLB Nick Barnett can use their speed to flush out running plays and cover backs and tight ends . REASONS FOR CONCERN : Aside from Donald Driver and impressive rookie Greg Jennings , the club has seen little from its wide receivers . Robert Ferguson and Rod Gardner have been nonfactors in the preseason . Driver is going to receive all the attention from defenses , and it 's going to be hard to get him the ball in clutch situations . With rookie Gs Tony Moll and Jason Spitz and a new zone-blocking scheme , it will take time for the offensive line to come together . Ttie kicking game is going to cause McCarthy some indigestion . K Dave Rayner and P Jon Ryan are unproven and could implode . Given the tough weather conditions late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Depth at safety could be a huge issue . The club is fine with SS Marquand Manuel and FS Nick Colllns , but if either starter gets hurt , next in line is rookie Tyrone Culver , a sixth-round pick . SILVERSTEIN 'S BOTTOM LINE : This team is too young to contend . The best the club can hope for is a strong finish to build momentum for next year . - Tom Silverstein STARTING LINEUP OFFENSES WR Robert Ferguson 2 LT Chad Clifton 4 LG Jason Spitz 1 C Scott Wells 2 RG Tony Moll 1 RT Mark Tauscher 4 TE Bubba Franks 2 WR Donald Driver 4 QB Brett Favre 4 FB William Henderson 2 RB Ahman Green 3 DEFENSE LE Aaron Kampman 3 DT Ryan Pickett 3 DT Colin Cole 2 RE Kabber Gbaja-Biamila 3 OLB Brady Poppinga 2 MLB Nick Barnett 3 OLB A.J.

He did n't like the gas prices , so he went out and bought a Scion . It 's one of those small little box cars , and when you pile in all the linemen , it looks like clowns when they 're getting out . Funniest trash-talker : It has to be Whit ( William Whitticker ) . One time , some defensive lineman said to him , " Keep your hands off my face . " And Whitticker said to him , " You keep your face off my hands . " That was a good one . Do n't mess with this guy In the locker room : Grey Ruegamer . Anyone with the Giants , beware . Clif ( Chad Clifton ) got a brand-new Escalade last year right off the lot . ( Ruegamer ) put confetti in his fans and when he went to turn his heat on , it blew all over him . Even in March , it was still coming out . He 's good . NFL Initiation : In my second game , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit .

When I got back to the sideline , Frank Winters says , " Hey , you better anchor up in there , kid . " I was like , " Here I am .
