In the land of no taste , the man with bad taste is king . John Waters has been lobbing turd grenades at American culture since Pink Flamingos in 1972 . These days , with unimaginative grossness prevailing in popular art , Waters seems a throwback , an Edwardian dandy forced to baby-sit the South Park kids . How to offend , he must wonder , without being an old fart ? <P> Here 's one way : make a comedy about a radical group that kidnaps a rich young woman and brainwashes her into joining their cause . And , in a piquant move , cast the real Patty Hearst in a small role . But since this is a movie about movies  --  spoiled film fatale Honey Whitlock ( Melanie Griffith ) is taken hostage by a cinematic liberation army led by a dreamy buff who calls himself Cecil B. DeMented ( Stephen Dorff )  --  an air of fantasy permeates the entire jape , detoxifying it . There 's a geniality to gags about ratings ( " Hey , hey , M.P.A.A. , how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams weepies ( " Patch Adams does not deserve a director 's cut ; the original was long enough " ) . Waters wants everyone to have a good laugh , targets and audience included . <P> The two stars give their roles a dizzy spin . Dorff 's Cecil sports a manic gleam that could be dementia or star quality ( if there 's a difference ) , and Griffith is aces as the Hollywood harridan ; when she sees her super-stretch limo , in white , she snarls , " Do I look like a coke dealer ? " Maybe Waters is ironizing his anger at the movie brats who have stolen his attitude but do n't understand his spirit . If so , the master is giving the kids a lesson here . Cecil B. proves how a dose of smart bad taste can be jolly good fun . <P>  --  R.C.
