Joseph McCarthy was just an obscure backbench Senator from Wisconsin looking for a political edge when he arrived in Wheeling , W.Va. , to address a Lincoln Day dinner . He was n't even sure what he was going to say , so he took along a speech on federal housing programs and another on alleged communists in government . A local Republican advised that the commie speech would have more oomph . And so that night , McCarthy , waving a paper in the air , proclaimed , " I have here in my hand a list of 205 that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party ... " <P> Overnight , his speech sparked a media firestorm that played to the basest fears of Americans swept up in a frightening cold war and triggered loyalty oaths , blacklists and personal betrayals that cost an estimated 10,000 Americans their jobs and some shattered innocents their lives . In 1954 he turned his bullying on the U.S. Army in widely watched television hearings that ultimately exposed McCarthy for the fraudulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , but his name remains synonymous with the most reviled style of American politics .  --  By Johanna McGeary
