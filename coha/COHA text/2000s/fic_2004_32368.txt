Wet &; Wild By Sandra Hill Dorchester Publishing Sandra Hill Ragnor Magnusson was in the midst of swiving the most beautiful woman in all the Norselands , and he was bored . In , out , in , out , in , out , ho , hum . He barely stifled a yawn . On the other hand , Inga Sigundottir , young widow of a Norman jarl and daughter of the Danish King Svein Forkbeard , said , " Oooh , Oooh ! You are soooo good , Ragnor , but must you go so fast ? I want this to last forever . " Of course I am good . But fast , you greedy wench ? Forever ? Hah ! I have been plowing the field betwixt your thighs for an hour at least . Bloody well reach your peak already , m'lady . That is what he thought , but what he did was slow his strokes to a snail 's pace . Inga 's eyes rolled back in her head . No surprise to Ragnor . He was an expert at the bedsport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Viking . Then , whilst Inga moaned and writhed beneath him , even as he did his in-and-out exercise , he scratched his buttock , wondering idly if there were fleas in the royal linens . Then he squeezed one of her nipples , knowing it was expected of him , thus producing more moans and writhing . Then he pondered whether there might be any roast boar left from the evening meal down in the castle kitchen . Yea , a slice of boar on a piece of manchet bread , washed down with a horn of ale , would go over nicelyabout now , even though it was well past midnight . But , alas and alak , he had work yet to complete ... bed work . For a brief moment , Ragnor entertained the notion that he might be getting old . He was only seven and twenty . That was too young to lose the enthusiasm for coupling ? Was n't it ? But then , he 'd lost enthusiasm for just about everything these days ... a-Viking , trading , running the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly alarming . He was born and raised to be a warrior . If not soldiering , what ? It had all started when his comrade in arms , Skorri Leifsson , died last year in battle . Ragnor had held his best friend in his arms while sword dew flowed steadily from the neck wound delivered by a Saxon blade . Nay , truth be told , Ragnor 's low spirits had begun long before Skorri 's death . There had been a hole in his heart and in his life since the death of his father Magnus Ericsson and nine siblings in a ship wreck more than ten years past . Before that , he 'd lost his beloved uncles Geirolf and Jorund Ericsson , Geirolf 's wife and twin daughters , and his grandparents Lord Eric Trygvasson and Lady Asgar . So many deaths ! " Why did you stop ? " Inga asked peevishly . With a jolt , Ragnor pulled himself back to the present . He smiled down at Inga , her blonde hair spread prettily about the pillow , her blue eyes staring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatience . She wrapped her long legs about his hips , not about to let him escape . Her lips were red and swollen from his earlier kisses . His manpart was buried in her sheath . He may have lost the " enthusiasm , " but his cock had not . In fact , it twitched . She smiled up at him , as if he 'd just paid her a compliment . He waggled his eyebrows at her . It was not her fault he 'd lost the " enthusiasm . " She deserved better . Lifting her legs over his shoulders , he began to pound at her then . Short , hammering strokes that brought her to her peak , and then beyond . Inga nigh screamed with pleasure . Seconds before he reached his own peak , he withdrew and spilled his seed upon her stomach with a long sigh of satisfaction . " Noooooo ! " Inga shrieked and grabbed his wilting staff in both hands , trying to jam him back into her body . " Huh ? " His eyes bulged at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man knew ... and every woman of experience should know ... that a sensitive organ , such as a cock , deserved better treatment after being the instrument of milady 's pleasure . Quickly , he pried himself out of her vice grip . If he had n't been wilting afore , he would be now . The pain was excruciating . On her knees , she now whacked him about the head with her pillow . " By your leave , milady , have you gone demented ? " he asked in between whacks . Sex affected people in odd ways betimes-once Ubbi the Ugly claimed he broke out in boils afterward , but perchance that stemmed from another cause . Ragnor had ne'er heard of it turning a woman demented , though . Some men , yea , but that was usually from lack thereof . She still reached for him , trying to pull him back inside of her ... which was ridiculous , really . Trying to put a wilted lily back in a slick pod was like ... well , putting an egg back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more angry . Baring her perfectly white teeth at him , she snarled , " You bastard ! You cur ! You lying , cod-sucking , too-charming son of a whore ! " Have a caution , Inga . Your true character is showing . " I never lied to you , " he proclaimed indignantly as he grabbed her in his arms and lifted her , feet dangling off the rush floor . " Stop squirming , Inga , and tell me what this is all about . " Tears welled in her eyes . " Why ? Why would you not give me your seed ? Am I not beautiful enough ? Was I not pleasing in the bed furs ? By the gods , my father will thrash me for failing . And he will thrash you , too , for compromising me . " " I do n't think so . " Ragnor was referring to the thrashing , as well as the compromising . But then he went stiff with alertness . Setting Inga down , he backed up a bit . " Your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , " she wailed , swiping at the tears which now overflowed and ran in rivulets down her cheeks . " Dost think I would dare such scandalous behavior without his blessing ? " Hah ! ' T was not me who made your virtue forfeit . Ragnor had heard of her " scandalous behavior " with several other men ; she was no untried virgin . Understanding dawned slowly . It had been a trap , set by the wily Danish king , ruler of all Jutland . Ragnor was not a king in his own land , but he was of noble birth ... a chieftain of wealthy estates left by his grandsire in Vestfold , the rich southern region of Hordaland . Forkbeard schemed to join their families in wedlock ... lock being the key word . He wanted to ensnare yet another Norse family into his spider web of intrigues . But Ragnor was no fool . Ever since he lay with his first maid at age thirteen , he had tried to be careful not to breed babes hither and yon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been taught a harsh lesson about the perils of virility by his father who beg at thirteen children . Children who gave him no end of trouble , himself included . Ragnor grinned and gave himself an inward pat on the back for his near escape . " You dare to find mirth in me ? " Inga narrowed her eyes at him and looked as if she might punch him in his mirthsome mouth . " Not in you , sweetling . Do not take it personal . " " And why not ? Would it be such a horrendous thing if your seed took root in my womb ? " Yea , it would . " I do not wish to wed ... yet . " " Yet ? " Not ever . " For years and years . " " If your father were here , he would force you to marry ... to carry on his line . " If my father were here , he would not need me to carry on his line . He would have any one of my six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand my reluctance , " he insisted . But would he ? Ragnor mused . Or would he tell me that family is everything , and it is time for me to start my own ? " Well , if you will not wed with me , you had best do me a favor , " Inga declared . " You owe me that at least . " Ragnor had to laugh at her turnabout . They were both standing there , stark naked . She no doubt wanted to couple with him again . Torolf , where are you when I need you ? Where that thought came from , Ragnor did not know . His brother had been dead these many years ... the last time he 'd seen him , they 'd both been rogues to the bone and both sixteen years old-born a mere sennight apart to the same father but different mothers in different locales . Often folks mistook them for twins so identical was them appearance , except his hair was black and eyes blue , while Torolf 's was blonde and his eyes brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He recalled more than one occasion when the two of them had taken one lusty lass into the bed furs betwixt them . That 's what Inga needed now . Two men to satisfy her needs . Torolf would be " up " for the game ... he just knew he would , his brother 's preference oft times being for blonde-haired women , while he preferred the rarer red . He liked his women to have a brain , as well , whilst Torolf had claimed it took no brain to spread one 's thighs . By the gods , you can make me smile , Torolf , even when you are in far-off Valhalla . He glanced at Inga , standing afore him in all her blonde , naked glory , a pensive expression on her face . Nay , his brother would not have said her " Nay . " Nor would he . Inga stamped her small foot in the rushes to mark her impatience . For the love of Frey ! She does want me to swive her again . Can I ? He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dead after all . Turned out he did not need his brother after all . Still , he thought , I miss you , Torolf . Even after all these years . " About that favor , Ragnor , " she said sweetly . Yea , she wants me again . Oh , well ! A Viking 's work is never done . But then , Inga surprised the spit out of him . " Dost think there is any leftover boar down in the kitchen ? Could you bring a little late night repast for me to sup on ? " He laughed . What else could he do when his lady friend was more interested in meat than ... well , meat ? ( Continues ... ) by Sandra Hill
