Death threats do n't deter New York 's fearless judge Leslie Crocker Snyder Photograph In 2000 , threats to her life stirred a public furor ( inset ) ; now Snyder ( at state supreme court with bodyguards ) calls her job " the culmination of everything you can do in criminal justice . " // The day in ' ' 88 that would forever change the way Judge Leslie Crocker Snyder lived her life began with a bit of Christmas shopping at Barney 's , the upscale New York City clothing store . " They had some great stuff for my husband and kids on the first floor , so I grabbed it and paid , " says Snyder a New York State supreme court justice . Back at 100 Centre Street , she had just walked in the door when a court officer pulled her aside to deliver the bombshell . " I 'm sorry , Judge , " he said , " but we 've just learned that a hit team is on its way here from L.A. with a contract to kill you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career  --  she was the first woman to prosecute a murder in New York City and the founder of the nation 's first sex-crimes unit-but this was a first for her to which she had never aspired : She was a target . That night she huddled with her husband , pediatrician Fredric Snyder to discuss their options . A Jamaican drug lord had apparently tried to take the law into his own hands by ordering the murder of the judge presiding at his trial ; police were saying she and her family would need 24 : - hour protection . But Snyder 's husband , always supportive , insisted that quitting was n't an option . " He said , That would be letting the bad guys win , " ' she recalls . Photograph As a prosecutor ( above , in ' ' 73 ) Snyder was " a tremendous trial lawyer , " says a colleague . // Since that day more than a decade ago , Snyder , 60 , has been threatened several more times , and the plainclothes detectives who trail her round-the-clock have long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bad guys have been losing ground . Thanks to Snyder who is known for setting sky-high bail and doling out supersize sentences , a large squadron of felons , Mob bosses and drug lords are now doing hard time in state penitentiaries . Snyder makes no secret of the fact that she revels in her work . Staring down from the bench at the end of the trial of a gang of murdering drug dealers called the Wild Cowboys in 1995 , she said , " You laughed in the faces of the police and the criminal justice system . No one could touch you .... But now we know this : You are not above the law ... I am going to make the rest of your lives very simple . " With that , she sentenced five of the killers to 116 years or more in prison . Snyder 's passion for the job-detailed in her new book , 25 to Life-has won her some fairly unconventional plaudits . On the street she is called Ice Princess or " 232 , " a reference to a two-century-plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents have seized thousands of tiny envelopes printed with the judge 's image , her face framed by flowing hair , used by pushers in The Bronx to package high-grade Colombian heroin . " At first I was stunned , " says Snyder . " That 's not exactly the way you want to be remembered . " On a more serious note , some critics allege that Snyder runs a courtroom that tilts distinctly in favor of prosecutors . " She 's absolutely charming , " says Murray Richman , former president of the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers , who counts Snyder as a friend . " But I always say the Christians had a better chance with the lions than a defense attorney does with her . " For her fans , though , Snyder is one of the reasons that New York City is much safer than it was 10 years ago . " She 's had the tough cases and given out tough sentences , " says former mayor Ed Koch , who appointed Snyder to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . " Snyder argues persuasively that she loses little sleep over her work . " I 've had an incredible number of violent and serious cases , and I treat those cases with the utmost seriousness , " she says . " And if the people are convicted by a jury , I do generally remove them from society forever . That just seems reasonable and correct . " Photograph Snyder ( with clerks Rocco DeSantis and Teresa Matushaj ) hears some 200 cases a year . // Born in New York and raised in Virginia and Maryland , Snyder was still a child when her parents-Lester , 90 , a retired professor of French literature and philosophy , and Billie , also 90 , a homemaker-started saying that someone who liked to argue so much should grow up to be a lawyer . She was 16 when she finished high school in Baltimore and headed to Radcliffe College , Harvard 's former sister school for women , on a full scholarship . Snyder graduated in 1962 and took a one-year business course to help support herself and the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jock . But when the relationship collapsed she headed to Paris . There , she worked for a pitch-fork manufacturer until her mother and father , dismayed at her seeming lack of direction , arrived to drag their daughter home . " Parents had a little more control then , " she says . Back in the U.S. , Snyder enrolled at Case Western Reserve University law school in Cleveland , becoming one of three women in her class . After a two-year stint at a corporate law firm in Manhattan , where the chief thrill was sitting in on a meeting with members of the Rolling Stones , Snyder landed a job with the Manhattan District Attorney 's office in 1968 . That was also the year she met her future husband , then in his first year of private practice , on a blind date set up by a friend . Fred Snyder , now 65 , made reservations at two restaurants , one dark and romantic , the other louder and lively . " She was kind of cute , so we went to the nice place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry , and 3% weeks after that they did so at the 21 Club with six guests on hand . ( For security reasons , the Snyders , who live in an Upper East Side apartment filled with paintings by Fred , prefer not to discuss their grown children . ) Photograph " She 's fun , she can talk about anything , " says Fred Snyder ( with Leslie on Long Island ) . // While still a relative rookie at the Manhattan D.A . ' s office , Snyder was assigned to a double rape case that changed the course of her career . " This defendant had grabbed two strangers off the street and dragged them into a tenement building , " Snyder recalls . Both women testified that he had raped them . But because of the wording of New York 's rape statute , physical evidence ( which was flawed in this case ) was needed to prove the crime , even though each women testified she had witnessed the attack on the other . Disgusted at the defendant 's acquittal-to mention nothing of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims-Snyder went to work lobbying the state legislature to reform the law , and in 1972 the statute was rewritten . Seeing there was more to be done , she persuaded her boss to establish the country 's first team of prosecutors wholly dedicated to handling sex crimes and treating their victims with sensitivity . " Back then , " she says , " people viewed sex crimes as crimes of sex , but what we came to learn was that these were crimes of control , domination and humiliation . " She also broke through a barrier in the D.A . ' s office that excluded women from the homicide bureau . " It was all male , and it had always been all male , " recalls John Keenan , 72 , then Manhattan 's chief assistant district attorney and now a federal judge . " There was a big cultural change going on 30 years ago that the current generation has only read about . In her own way , Leslie was a major part of that revision . " Snyder became a judge during the ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . As crime soared , the court system swelled to accommodate complex , multidefendant cases that demanded disciplined and highly organized judges . Snyder became a specialist at such trials , including one involving 41 defendants , 40 murders and virtually an entire Bronx neighborhood held hostage . As if that were n't hard enough , Snyder also had to contend with half a dozen credible death threats-including , in 2000 , a contract put out by a jailed stock-fraud suspect named Stuart Winkler , for whom she had set bail at $1 million . Winkler was convicted of conspiracy to murder Snyder later that year . Now approaching her 20th year on the bench , Judge Snyder does not deny that she would welcome the chance to run for Manhattan D.A. , although the current holder of that office , Robert Morgenthau , 83 , shows no signs of retiring . Fortunately , she says , she still enjoys what she 's doing . " I like the phrase Truth , justice and the American way , " ' says Snyder , who clearly considers all three her vocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away for life , and you can put young people who are n't violent yet into drug programs or education . So being a judge , " she says , " you can actually do some good . " <p>
