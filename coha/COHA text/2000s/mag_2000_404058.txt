Your Government At Work ... <p> A few years ago , CR reported that the Social Security Administration fails to communicate in an " authoritative , credible , accurate , and accessible manner " to the American public , particularly to the 44 million individuals receiving Social Security benefits ( see " Official Social Security Information Misleads , ' May 1998 ) . The following , taken from recent Congressional testimony presented by the General Accounting Office ( GAO ) , reveals continuing problems with the agency 's ability to convey important information to beneficiaries .  --  Ed . <p> <p> Each year the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) mails millions of letters to applicants and recipients of the Old Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance programs , commonly referred to as Social Security , and the Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) program . These letters tell the public whether they are eligible to receive monthly cash benefits or whether their benefit amounts are changing . Because the letters contain important information affecting people 's everyday lives , they need to be clearly written and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public that its letters will clearly explain the agency 's decisions so that the public can understand how and why SSA made the decisions and what to do if it disagrees . <p> We have long been critical of SSA 's letters . In 1994 , we testified before this subcommittee that many SSA letters , particularly those dealing with Social Security overpayments , were difficult to understand . We found letters that left out information necessary to understand SSA 's decisions , presented information in an illogical order , or failed to explain clearly how SSA had adjusted benefits . More recently , the subcommittee asked the GAO to assess SSA 's progress in improving its letters . <p> We focused our review on bur categories of automated , high-volume letters to the public : ( 1 ) letters awarding Social Security benefits , ( 2 ) letters adjusting Social Security benefits , ( 3 ) letters awarding SSI benefits , and ( 4 ) letters adjusting SSI benefits . SSA mails about 14.2 million of these letters each year . We focused on these letters because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their eligibility for benefits or changes in the amount of their benefits-issues that can significantly affect their lives . We used writing consultants to help us develop the criteria to assess whether the letters communicated clearly and to verify our assessment of the types of problems that occur in them . We also interviewed SSA officials responsible for improving the agency 's letters and reviewed documents on past and current evaluations of the letters and its initiatives to improve them . <p> In summary , our work showed that the majority of letters in each of the four categories we reviewed did not clearly communicate at least one of the following key points : ( 1 ) SSA 's decision ( that is , the action SSA was taking on a claim that prompted the agency to send the letter ) , ( 2 ) the basis for SSA 's decision , ( 3 ) the financial effect of SSA 's decision on payments to the individual , or ( 4 ) the recourse the individual could take in response to SSA 's decision . The lack of clarity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequenced information , incomplete or missing explanations , contradictory information , and confusing numerical information . An unclear , explanation of the basis for SSA 's decision  --  that is , not clearly explaining the program rules or facts on which SSA 's decision was based  --  was the most widespread problem among the four categories of letters . We also found one particular group of SSI award letters in which none of the four key points was clear ( see sidebar at left ) . <p> SSA acknowledges that these letters contain the problems we identified and agreed the problems have existed for years ; however , for many of the problems , the agency has not taken any corrective action and , overall , the agency has not placed a high priority on improving its letters . Many of the problems we identified are not amenable to quick fixes but , rather , will require a comprehensive revision of the language in the letters and rewriting the agency 's software applications that generate them . Competing demands for computer systems resources have led SSA to reschedule improvements to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court case has led SSA to delay improvements to the SSI award and benefit-adjustment letters . SSA recently announced plans to improve its Social Security benefit-adjustment letters and has begun a major initiative to improve its SSI award and benefit-adjustment letters . But it will be years before the improvements are completed for most of these letters , even if there are no more delays and SSA adheres to its current plans . A Typical , Unclear Social Security Letter <p> One particular group of Supplemental Security Administration ( SSI ) award letters  --  those sent to notify SSI applicants that they have been awarded benefits for previous but not future months  --  proved particularly confusing , because they contained numerous contradictions , illogically sequenced explanations , and incorrect statements . As a result , none of the four key points  --  SSA 's decision , the basis for the decision , the financial effect on the individual , and the recourse available to the claimant  --  is clear . Key excerpts from a typical letter that awarded benefits only for previous months illustrate these letters ' many problems , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have highlighted passages with bold type ) . This letter was sent on October 13 , 1999 , to a disabled adult . In 1998 and 1999 , more than 100,000 individuals , or about 13% to 15% of all SSI awardees , received benefits only for previous months and thus would have gotten a similar letter . <p> SSA 's decision is unclear , because the letter goes back and forth as to whether the applicant is eligible or ineligible for SSI . For example , the first sentence in the letter ( " A " ) informs the applicant that she is eligible for SSI benefits , as does the first sentence on the second page of the letter ( " E " ) . She is also told on a subsequent page that her benefits will continue if she is still disabled in the future ( " H " ) . But elsewhere in the letter , she is told that she is not eligible for SSI ( " F " and " G " ) and that she will not be receiving any more payments ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) . <p> The basis for SSA 's decision is unclear as well because the letter illogically tells the applicant that she can not receive any more payments because she is disabled and living in Massachusetts ( " E " ) . Also , this illogical reason for nonpayment is listed before the actual reason for nonpayment  --  her income ( " F " ) . <p> The financial effect of SSA 's decision is unclear , because the letter makes contradictory statements about the months for which benefits are payable . First , the letter informs the reader that she will receive $3,367.36 in benefits for March through October 999 ( " B " and " D " ) , but later it incorrectly states that SSA can pay benefits for only one month  --  March 1999 ( " E " ) . <p> Finally , the recourse available to the claimant is unclear , because the letter incorrectly informs her that she must file a new application before she can receive any more benefits ( " I " ) . The letter does not explain that , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to file a new application if the individual becomes eligible again within 12 months . The letter is not clear about SSA 's decision , the basis for the decision , the financial effect of the decision , or the applicant 's appeal rights .  --  General Accounting Office <p> The Most Significant Problems in Four Categories of SSA Letters and Their Estimated Frequency TABLE <p> ILLUSTRATIONS ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Barbara D.
