<p> The University of California , besieged by criticism over its management of Los Alamos National Laboratory , beat back a strong challenge Wednesday from a team headed by Lockheed Martin Corp . and the University of Texas for control of the storied weapons lab it has run for over six decades . <p> The decision , announced by Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman in Washington , D.C. , allows UC to retain management of the lab it has run since World War II , but now it will do so in partnership with a larger consortium that includes corporate giant Bechtel National of San Francisco . <p> The partnership was formed earlier this year after the government contract to run the nation 's lab was put out to bid for the first time in the lab 's 62-year history because of a string of security lapses and allegations of fraud and mismanagement . <p> Despite the missteps , the UC group managed to prevail not only over a consortium led by aerospace titan Lockheed Martin that included the huge University of Texas system and smaller industrial partners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's management . <p> The new contract , which begins June 1 , runs for seven years and is worth up to $512 million . Good performance could earn the UC group an extension of up to 13 years . " I can not stress enough that this is a new contract , with a new team , marking a new approach to management at Los Alamos , " Bodman said in announcing the decision . " It is not a continuation of the previous contract . " <p> Loss of the contract by the UC group , officially known as Los Alamos National Security LLC , could have hurt not only UC but California 's reputation as a world center of scientific and technological excellence . <p> The 13,200-employee lab is one of the nation 's two nuclear weapons design laboratories . The other is Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , which is also run by UC . The first atomic bomb was developed at Los Alamos in 1945 . <p> UC President Robert Dynes said in a statement that he was pleased the Energy Department decided to stick with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era . " I am confident in the men and women who serve our nation at Los Alamos , and I know that they will continue to chart new frontiers and help solve some of the greatest scientific and technological problems of our time , " he said . <p> The Lockheed-Texas consortium issued a statement wishing the UC-Bechtel team every success , but a spokesman later expressed disappointment . <p> " Of course , we 're very disappointed , " said spokeswoman Wendy Owen . " At this point ... we still have more questions than answers . " <p> She said the group had not decided yet whether to appeal the decision . Under the new contract , UC will share central responsibilities with Bechtel National , BWX Technologies , Washington Group International and a smaller consortium of the University of New Mexico , New Mexico State University and the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology . <p> Physicist Michael Anastasio , who until recently was head of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and temporarily left that post to run the UC-Bechtel competition , will serve as the lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interim director , Robert Kuckuck . A permanent replacement for Anastasio at Livermore has yet to be named . <p> Energy Department officials declined to spell out Wednesday the partners ' relative responsibilities , including management of lab security and safety , both long-standing problems at Los Alamos . <p> The problems have included reported financial irregularities that led to forced resignations of the former lab director and top auditor ; the apparent loss of computer disks that supposedly contained weapons information , although officials later concluded the disks had never existed ; and safety problems such as a staffer who injured her eye by gazing into a laser and another who suffered lung damage after being ordered to work in a room containing a noxious gas . <p> In April 2003 , the Energy Department and Congress ordered that all future lab contracts be open to outside bidders . <p> In making Wednesday 's announcement , Bodman said he believed the new contract would " relegate ( the lab 's ) tumult to the past . " <p> UC 's selection , nonetheless , angered Rep. Joe Barton , R-Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shot off a letter to Bodman following the announcement . <p> " As you know , " he said , " over the past several years the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations has held numerous hearings to investigate waste , fraud , and abuse of government resources at the Los Alamos National Laboratory . <p> " These hearings have also reviewed several security breaches that have put our national security at risk . ... Based on the track record by the University of California and the seemingly invulnerable culture of mismanagement at Los Alamos , I am surprised to learn that the current contractor has been invested with new trust . I have minimal hope and no belief that UC can reverse its record of consistent failure . " <p> The actual decision , Bodman said , was made by Tom D'Agostino , assistant deputy administrator for defense programs at the National Nuclear Security Administration , a quasi-independent agency that oversees the nuclear weapons department for the Energy Department . <p> D'Agostino based his selection , Energy Department officials said , partly on the competitors ' formal proposals and partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a team of career civil servants from throughout the nuclear weapons complex and chaired by the agency 's former general counsel Tyler Przybylek . <p> " I can tell you with confidence that ( UC 's ) proposal itself really tightened up the accountability line significantly , " Przybylek said . <p> Energy Department officials said they would conduct a debriefing with both bidding teams in the next 10 days to explain in detail why the bid had gone to the UC group . <p> In recent months , many Los Alamos staffers had predicted the Lockheed team would get the contract because of what they regard as UC mismanagement . <p> John Jennings , a Los Alamos safety specialist who helped the FBI expose financial corruption at the lab in 2002-03 , said Wednesday 's decision worried him because he feared it would " leave in a lot of the old problems and old managers and the ' good old boy ' network we 've had up there ( at the lab ) lately . " <p> Sen. Pete Domenici , R-N.M. , the chairman of the Senate Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding , later dismissed the concerns as coming from crybabies . <p> " Frankly , I heard more comment from ( Los Alamos ) people saying , ' Goodness I hope it ( the winner ) is n't Lockheed ' as I did saying the opposite , " he said . <p> Anti-nuclear groups were not among those favoring the UC team . <p> Danielle Brian , head of the Washington-based Project on Government Oversight , a frequent Energy Department critic , asked : " What does it take for UC to suffer the consequences of screwing up ? Lockheed was n't a great alternative , but it is hard to see how UC could possibly have been given a vote of confidence . We expect a continuation of the era of chaos at Los Alamos . " <p> Sen. Barbara Boxer , D-Calif. , said she , however , was very happy . The lab offers " a continued prestige , drawing top scientists , being on the cutting edge . It 's important for the state . " <p> Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger also said he was pleased that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Today is another great day for California , " he said in a statement . <p> Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison , R-Texas , who had urged University of Texas officials to join the competition , said Wednesday that Bodman had told her the decision was based on the merits of two bids , not on politics . <p> " California has an advantage in continuity , and that was a factor , " Hutchison said . " Secretary Bodman assured me the process was fair . In the end , I believe this has made the California partnership stronger from a national security standpoint , and that is positive for our nation . "
