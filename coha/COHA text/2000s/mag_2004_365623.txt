Doctors will probably still find reasons to give injections , but a new drug-delivery system approved by the FDA could take the pain out of at least some of them . The device , called the SonoPrep , developed by researchers at M.I.T. and Israel 's Ben-Gurion University , delivers medication through tiny pores in the skin . It uses ultrasound waves to create temporary microchannels in the skin through which drugs can pass . The device was approved as a way to anesthetize the skin with lidocaine cream to prepare patients , especially children , for painful procedures like the insertion of catheters and IV lines . But developers hope to use the same technology soon to deliver other kinds of medications.  --  By David Bjerklie
