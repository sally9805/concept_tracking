dust SHANGHAI , JUNE 1937 , the air hot and muggy . My father stood on the verandah of our home , a villa on Hungjao Road in the western suburbs outside of the International Settlement . His back was to me as he looked out at the expanse of lawn that to me , at six , seemed vast as an ocean . He faced east , toward the Bund and the Whangpoo River , and I thought I smelled the river 's familiar sharpness , a grimy mix of factory smoke and seaweed and fish , though the Whangpoo was some ten miles away . It was dusk , a word that I understood as " dust , " which made sense to me , one of those few words whose meaning matched its sound . That was how the world seemed at that hour : slightly dusty , softened and dimly covered in some eerie talc , the sharp edges chalk-picture blurry . My father had played polo that afternoon and still wore his riding clothes , off-white jodhpurs and a jersey shirt , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots that I wanted to touch to see if they were real . They seemed somehow conjured up . He , too , seemed conjured up , in that dim light . He leaned on the verandah wall , his drink next to him , a tumbler that held Four Roses , golden , the color of caramel , and it was as though the Scotch softened everything : the night , the stone wall , the leaves of the plane trees just beyond , the sharp edges of the crystal tumbler , my father himself . My father stood very still , gazing out at a city that he loved . To me , it was simply home , no more , no less . But as I stood in the doorway , watching him , waiting for him to feel my presence , I felt certain inside that I was in exactly the right place : this house , this doorway , this night , this father . I wore a white cotton nightgown that had been sewn by hand . I was clean , just out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down my back . Chu Shih , our cook , had given me long-life noodles and jasmine tea for dinner , then helped me get ready for bed so that I could say good night to my parents before they went out . I heard my mother 's voice then , and I turned from the doorway before my father saw me . She was descending the long curved staircase , and she wore a wine-colored silk dress with a border of pearls sewn into the neckline . My mother 's name was Genevieve , and it suited her : she was elegant and graceful , and was always known only by her full name , with one exception : to my father she was Eve , and when he said her name , he did so intimately . Our last name , Schoenepronounced " show-en " meant beautiful or handsome in German , and I thought it suited both of my parents . When I was afraid , I would repeat their names to myself , and the sound of those names lulled me and made me feel safe : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I suddenly wanted her not to go out . I wanted her close , though there was no reason to be anxious . This was just an ordinary night . My parents went out most evenings . I learned only later , when my mother and I had moved to the United States , the startling fact that parents usually stayed at home with their children in the evenings . My mother did not share my father 's passion for Shanghai , but rather held the city at arm 's length . It was an entity she did not want to know better , and she was every bit as diffident toward it as my father was affectionate . He knew every part of the city , while my mother knew only what she had to . She seemed to regard it as a temporary post , not a home , and she used what she called her landmark system . In each neighborhood , she chose a starting point , and she always started from that place , regardless of where she had to end up . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nightclub she liked on Route Cardinal Mercier . In the International Settlement it was the Sun Sun Department Store at the corner of Tibet and Nanking Road . On the Bund it was the brass lions in front of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank . Her plan seemed to work ; my mother was never lost . I understood her system , for I had a landmark of my own , a place I always started from to get wherever I was going , a reference point for everything I did . It was my father . My father was , from my careful observations of him , a person who solved problems . When I was five , I accidentally swallowed a Reese 's cinnamon drop whole , and I began to choke . My father stood only a few feet away ; we were at the home of his friend Will Marsh , and he was just saying good night . He glanced at me , looked back at his friend , looked at me again , and said , " Excuse me . " Then he simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and laughed when the cinnamon drop popped out of my mouth . For a long time , his ability to fix whatever was wrong was a given of my childhood . There were other givens as well . My mother 's elegance , her patient manner , her propriety and composure . She taught me never to say I was full after a meal , but only that I had " had a sufficiency . " Her beauty was a given . I knew even as a young child that she was beautiful , not the way children think their mothers areI knew she was , from the way men stared when she entered the room , the way other women regarded her , the intensity with which my father watched her . For a long time , her beautiful long hair was a given , always worn in a chignon at the nape of her neck . It seemed somehow private , the most intimate part of her , as though it held secrets she would never divulge . Her intense yet somehow odd devotion to my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : she circled only him , yet always at a distance . On that summer evening , when my mother reached the bottom of the stairs , she glanced around her as though getting her bearings . It was a familiar gesture ; she was looking for my father , and it was what she always did first when she entered a room or a house or a garden . Now she glanced about and , not seeing him , looked at me . " He 's outside , " I said simply She nodded , then leaned toward me , smoothing the wet strands of my bangs off my forehead . " You 're warm , Anna . " " Can I see your hair ? " I asked . She stooped so that she was closer to my height . She did this gracefully , a small miracle in her long , fitted dress . She smelled like Chanel No. 5 , and just under it , a trace of lilac from her bath . She turned so that I could see her back , and her hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her neck . I leaned close to see what she was using to hold it there . On the carved mahogany dresser in her room was a Venetian leather jewelry box that held in its crimson velvet lining more than a dozen fasteners and combs made of ivory , tortoiseshell , silver , jade . Tonight she wore my favorites : two intricately carved ivory needles that intersected and held her hair perfectly in place . We heard my father 's footsteps then . My mother looked up , about to stand , and I asked the question that was always in my mind but which I had never voiced . " Do you love him more , or me ? " She did not hesitate . " I love you both , " she said simply . And then she rose , smoothed her skirt , and went outside to join him . They left a short time later , after my father had showered and shaved and dressed in a dinner coat . He whistled " Moonglow " as he came downstairs , and I knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window in the kitchen , sipping a glass of sherry , waiting for him . He came into the room and smiled at her . And then he saw me , sitting at the table , drawing . " You , " he said , and he headed toward me and seemed as large as the huge brass lions that guarded the entrance of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank . " And now for you . " And in two strides he reached me and lifted me from my chair and held me so high that I felt the closeness of the ceiling just above my head . I breathed in his scent of Old Spice and Four Roses and Philippine cigars , and I was certain that my father was strong enough to hold up the world . His hands were warm and firm and huge around my rib cage , and I wanted him to never put me down . But he did , of course , and my sides stayed warm from his grip as he roughly kissed my cheek and held the door for my mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the sound of car doors as my parents slid into the backseat of the Packard , which waited for them outside , then the crunch of gravel as Mei Wah , my father 's Sikh chauffeur , walked to the front of the car , and then the sound of his door . And then I heard the even hum of the Packard 's engine , a sound I came to dread , as it eased toward the street . I went out on the verandah . My father 's glass was still on the wall , empty except for its strong scent of Scotch . I watched the car slowly make its way toward the street , its red taillights bright . When it reached the end of the driveway and left the gravel to meet the road , it blew out a small cloud of dirt , like a kiss , and I took a deep breath and felt the fine dust of my father 's presence , familiar , another given , filling the cracks and covering the surface of my life .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
