The instant he stepped inside the dark barn , Joe Welch knew he 'd found the source of his urgent sense that something was wrong . Someone was in the barn . Someone who had no business being there . The thoroughbreds were restless , moving agitatedly about in their stalls , not quiet like they should be so late at night . One  --  he thought it was Suleimann  --  whinnied to him softly . There was an indefinable heaviness in the air : the weight of an unseen presence . He could feel it , tangible as the scent of smoke that still lingered outside from the burning of a pile of brush that afternoon . Standing in the rectangle of moonlight that streamed through the wide door he had just rolled partly open , squinting down the long row of stalls , Joe searched the shadows for an intruder . At the same time , his fingers slid along the sanded-smooth planks , groping for the light switch . He found it , flipped it  --  and nothing happened . Figured . The lights were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind had been up earlier , and sometimes , out here in the county , that was all it took to knock down a power line . Or maybe a fuse was blown . That happened sometimes too , when too many lights were turned on at once . Lots of lights were on up at the Big House tonight ; he 'd seen them as he 'd walked across the field . So it was probably a fuse . Damn . His gaze continued to search the darkness as his hand dropped to his side . After a moment he found what he was seeking : a darker , denser , human-shaped shadow that seemed to be sitting on the soft raked sawdust of the floor . The figure 's back rested against the left-side wall . Its legs were stretched straight out in front of it , solid black logs against the pale umber of the sawdust . In the darkness , Joe might have missed it entirely , except that it was the one shadow that remained motionless amid all the other shadows that shifted and danced just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure it was the big roan now  --  called to him again , anxiously . " You there ! Identify yourself , please ! " His challenge was peremptory , but not altogether rude , on the off-chance that it might be his employer or one of his employer 's guests sitting there on the ground . No answer . No movement . Nothing . Joe took a deep breath , steadying himself as his muscles tensed . Billionaires and their pals did n't sit in barn shavings as a general rule , so he thought he could pretty much rule out that possibility . Which left  --  what ? A couple of these horses had been purchased just a few months before at Keeneland 's July sale for around a million dollars each , the rest were more or less valuable to some degree , and an intruder presented a host of possibilities , none of them good . As he prepared himself to scare or beat the bejesus out of whoever had invaded his barn , Joe suddenly recognized , along with the expected smells of hay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sour mash . It slid up his nostrils and down his throat , and left a distinct taste on his tongue . A taste that , over the years , he had come to know and hate . His tension dissipated as anger and frustration took its place . " Pop ? " The smell was a dead giveaway . Who else was it likely to be at this time of night but his dad , drunk as a skunk as he was always swearing he would never be again ? When liquored up , Cary Welch sometimes visited Whistledown 's barn , imagining that he was the big-time thoroughbred trainer he had been once , instead of a drunken has-been with a damaged reputation that no owner would let within spitting distance of his horses . Including Charles Haywood , Joe 's primary employer and owner of Whistledown Farm , whose barn and horses these were . No answer except another agitated whinny from Suleimann and the restless stomping of hooves . Still the sitting figure did n't move . But there was no mistaking that smell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this barn when you 've been drinking , and you damned well know it ! I ought a kick your scrawny ass from here to Sunday and back ! " The shadow did n't so much as twitch , did n't respond in any way . Had his father passed out ? Swearing loudly , Joe headed toward the motionless figure . Horses snorted and nickered at him from both sides as they came to the fronts of their stalls en masse . " You think I do n't see you ? I see you plain as day , you old fart . " His booted feet were surprisingly loud as they stomped through the sawdust . The shadow  --  his father  --  remained as still as a rabbit in the open with a dog nosing about . " I 'm telling you right now , I do n't need this crap . " It was shortly after one A.M. on a frostbitten Thursday in early October . Joe had gone to bed at eleven , just like always . He 'd even fallen asleep , dead to the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always . But he 'd woken with a start at 12:38 A.M. , according to the glowing green numbers on his bedside clock . He never woke in the middle of the night anymore  --  a long day of hard , physical work was , he 'd found , the ultimate cure for insomnia  --  but tonight he had . Groggy , cross , filled with an indefinable sense of unease , he 'd made the most obvious mental connection : something was up with his kids . Rising , pulling on the jeans and flannel shirt he 'd left draped over the chair in the corner of his small bedroom , he 'd padded barefoot out into the old farmhouse 's drafty upstairs hall to check on them . Jen 's room , right across the hall from his own , was his first stop . Poking his head inside without turning on the light , he discovered his eleven-year-old daughter sleeping soundly on her side facing the door . Her knees were drawn up almost to her slight chest beneath the tattered red and blue , horse-appliqud quilt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanned out over her pillow . One small hand cushioned her tanned cheek . Ruffles , the fat beagle mix that was Jen 's constant companion , lay on her back at Jen 's feet , all four legs up in the air , her long black ears spread out on either side of her . Unlike Jen , she was snoring lustily . She roused herself enough to open one brown eye and blink at him . Joe made a face at himself as he closed the door again . No trouble here . Not that he had expected any . Not really . Jen had never caused him any trouble in her life that he could remember . If occasionally the thought occurred that she was her mother 's daughter , Joe put it out of his mind . It was he who had the raising of her , not Laura . Laura was long gone . Josh and Eli were a different story . The room they shared was half a dozen steps down the hall , just past the bathroom . One of them was the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiss . Not that they were bad boys  --  they were n't  --  but they were boys , and as such no strangers to mischief . He opened their door , looked inside , and discovered sixteen-year-old Eli , still clad in jeans and a T-shirt , fast asleep , sprawled on his back on the rumpled twin bed . His feet in their once white but now laundered-to-gray athletic socks extended past the end of the mattress by a good three inches , one arm trailed off the side of the bed , and headphones were clamped to his ears . Eli was almost as tall as Joe 's own six-foot-three , with a lanky frame that had not yet started to fill out . His mouth was open slightly as he snored , and a textbook of some kind  --  algebra , probably , he 'd said he had a major test tomorrow  --  lay open on his chest . Against the far wall , fourteen-year-old Josh 's bed was rumpled but empty . Ah-hah , Joe thought , congratulating himself on his finely tuned parental radar . Years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered him acutely sensitive to his children . If Josh was up and about at this time of night , secure in the knowledge that his old man usually slept like a rock , he was about to get one heck of a surprise . The lamp on the battered oak nightstand between the twin beds was on . The volume on the stereo beside the lamp had to be cranked up high , because , despite the headphones , Joe could hear the whine of tinny guitar riffs and the rhythmic thump of a driving bass . As he 'd said to Eli on countless occasions , maybe he 'd do better in his classes if he just once tried studying without the stereo blasting his eardrums into the next state . Of course , Eli claimed that the music helped him concentrate . Not that he could prove it by his grades . Mouth twisting wryly , Joe stepped into the room and removed the book from Eli 's chest . Closing it , he put it on the nightstand and turned off the stereo . Lifting the headphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as twitched  --  he put those on the nightstand , too , switched off the lamp , and left the room , closing the door behind him . Now , where was Josh ? As soon as Joe started down the steep , narrow staircase that led to the bottom floor , he heard the TV . A gentle bluish glow illuminated the arch that led into the living room and turned the well-worn floorboards at the base of the steps a weird shade of brownish purple . Frowning , Joe stepped into the patch of purple and looked left , into the living room . The TV was on , volume low , tuned to what looked like one of the Terminator movies . Still dressed in the ratty gray sweater and faded jeans he had worn to school , Josh lay on his back on the couch , his black head pillowed on the comfortably worn , brown-tweed arm as he followed the action on the screen . " Hey , buddy , why are n't you in bed ? " Joe asked gruffly , moving into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afield than this . Josh twisted around to look at him . " Eli 's got to have the light on so he can study . " Josh 's voice was bitter in the way of put-upon younger brothers everywhere . " Bummer . " Joe crossed to the TV and turned it off , then looked back at Josh . " Eli 's asleep . Go up to bed . You 've got school tomorrow . " " Dad ! That was Arnold ! " Josh protested , sitting up . At about five-eight and thin as a blade of grass , he still had a lot of growing to do . He ran his fingers over the short stubble of his severely crew-cut hair in frustration . The hairstyle , Joe thought , was Josh 's attempt to make himself look as unlike Eli as possible , which was hard when the brothers bore so close a resemblance . Josh frequently teased Eli about what Josh mockingly called his older brother 's long , beautiful hair . Eli was vain about his nape-length , slightly wavy black locks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received . " Too bad . It 's almost one o'clock . Go to bed . " " Ca n't I please watch the rest of it ? " Josh 's blue eyes were pleading as he looked up at Joe , and there was a wheedling note in his voice . " Nope . Go to bed . Right now , " Joe said , unmoved . " Please ? " " You heard me . " Josh was the one who could be counted on to test the boundaries of his patience every step of the way , Joe reflected . Sometimes when he had to tell Josh something fifty times before he was obeyed Joe found himself one deep breath away from making his point with a swift kick to the boy 's butt , but underneath he understood his second son 's need to assert his individuality . Just as he understood his need to differentiate himself from his older and , to Josh 's eyes , more accomplished brother . " If you 'd make Eli turn out the light at a decent time , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never make Eli do anything . " Josh 's voice was sullen . " Joshua . Go to bed . " Crossing his arms over his chest , Joe mentally counted to ten . Josh looked at him , and Joe looked levelly back . Josh snorted with disgust , stood up , and shuffled from the room , the too-long legs of his baggy jeans dusting the floor as he went . After watching his son disappear up the stairs , Joe shook his head , then turned slowly around in the dark living room . The kids were fine , it seemed . Had he heard something , then , the TV maybe or some other noise Josh had made , that had been out of the ordinary enough to wake him up ? Maybe . Probably . But while he was up , it would n't hurt to check on the horses . He was almost as attuned to them as he was to his kids . Horses were his livelihood , and his passion . He bred them , trained them , cared for them . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for love and what he could wrest out of the business , and , for a steady paycheck , those of Charles Haywood , in the immaculate , twin-gabled white barn up the hill . Listening with half an ear to the noises Josh made getting ready for bed upstairs  --  toilet flushing , sink running , floor creaking , the opening and closing of doors  --  Joe moved from the living room to the hall and then to the kitchen at the rear of the house . Sitting down in one of the sturdy , white-painted kitchen chairs , he thrust his bare feet into the lace-up brown work boots he had left just inside the back door , tied them , and stood up . Grabbing his University of Kentucky Wildcats blue nylon parka from the coatrack , he let himself out the back door , locked it behind him , and headed across the cold-crisped grass for his barn . It was a beautiful night , bright and clear , colder than usual for October , which was generally mild in Kentucky . Overhead dozens of stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a sliver of being full , and shone round and white as a car 's headlight , illuminating the gently rolling countryside with its scattering of houses , barns , four-board fences , and two-lane roads . His thirty-three acres marched alongside Haywood 's six hundred and seventeen , but because his acreage had once been part of the Whistledown Farm property  --  the manager 's house , to be precise  --  the two barns were within easy walking distance of each other . His , on the little rise behind his own house , and Whistledown 's , atop a bigger hill and separated from his property by a single black-painted fence , were no more than half a dozen acres apart . As he approached his barn , the triangular-shaped pond to the right shone black in the moonlight , reflecting the night sky as faithfully as a mirror . The covered training ring , a three-quarters-of-a-mile indoor oval that allowed him to work his horses in inclement weather , sat silent and deserted at a little distance to the rear , looking for all the world like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring , an owl hooted in the woods bordering the back of the property , and from some greater distance still a coyote howled . Near the edge of the woods , just visible as a solid dark block against the variegated charcoal of the timber , stood his father 's small log cabin . The lights were out . No surprise there . Like himself , his widowed father was a horseman , which meant he was an early-to-bed , early-to-rise kind of guy . When he was n't drinking , that is . Joe stepped inside his barn , flipped on the light  --  an evenly spaced lineup of cheap fluorescent fixtures overhead , not fancy but adequate for the job  --  and looked around . Silver Wonder came to the front of her stall , blinking and snorting a soft question . Drago and Timber Country were next , thrusting their heads out of the open top of the Dutch-style stall doors , looking at him curiously . Down the row , more horses , some his , some boarded , popped their heads out . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly wondered what had brought him to their domicile in the middle of the night . " Everything okay , girl ? " Joe walked over to Silver Wonder and rubbed her well-shaped head . The ten-year-old brood mare nudged him , wanting a treat , and he felt around in his coat pocket for a peppermint . Silver Wonder loved peppermint . Unwrapping it , he held it out to the petite gray . She took the candy between velvet lips , drew it into her mouth , then chomped contentedly . The scent of peppermint filled the air as he made a quick circuit around the stalls . Built in a rectangle , the barn housed approximately forty horses in two rows with stalls facing each other on each side , an office area at the front , and an open area at the rear . The utilitarian layout provided what amounted to a small track around an indoor core of stalls and tack rooms so that the horses could be cooled out indoors when necessary . It was obvious from the demeanor of the horses that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . " Ending up back where he had started , Joe patted Silver Wonder 's neck affectionately , resisted her nudging hints for another peppermint , and left the barn . Probably Josh being up was the only thing out of the ordinary on this starlit night . This was Simpsonville , Kentucky , after all . Population 907 . The heart of the horse country that was Shelby County . Paradise County , the locals called it for the beauty of the landscape and the tranquility of the lifestyle . Crime was so rare here as to be almost nonexistent . Yet Joe had felt strongly that something was wrong . And , he realized , he still did . He would check on the Whistledown horses , then walk once around his dad 's house before turning in again . It was a simple matter to scale the fence . Actually , he did it an average of a dozen times a day . A boot on the lowest board , a leg flung over , and it was done . He climbed the hill to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of nocturnal creatures going about their business . On the horizon , silhouetted against a stand of tall oaks , Whistledown , Haywood 's white antebellum mansion , glowed softly in the yellow shimmer of its outside security lights . With Mr. Haywood and a party of friends in residence for the Keeneland races , the usually empty house was lit up like a Christmas tree . Diffused light glowed through the curtains at a dozen windows . Four cars were parked in the long driveway that most of the year held none . Must be something to be so rich that a place like Whistledown was used for only about six weeks a year , mainly during the spring and fall Keeneland races , Joe mused . Horses were nothing more than an expensive hobby to Charles Haywood , and Whistledown Farm was only one of about a dozen properties he owned . Of course , Joe was sure the guy had problems , everybody had problems , but with money like that how bad could they be ? He 'd like to try a few of the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly worrying about covering expenses . The most important things in his life  --  his kids and his horses  --  both required a lot of outlay without any guarantee of a return . Unlike his own admittedly shabby barn , Whistledown 's was shiny with new white paint , two stories tall , and embellished with the twin scarlet cupolas that were the farm 's trademark . Reaching the door , Joe unlatched it , rolled it open , and stepped inside . Moments later he went stomping furiously down the length of the barn , the smell of whiskey drawing him like a beacon , cursing and ready , willing , and able to put the fear of God into his dad . His patience was at an end . Six weeks ago , after Joe had hauled him out of Shelby County High School 's kickoff basketball game , where Cary had seriously embarrassed Eli , who was a starting forward , and his other grandkids by bellowing the school fight song from the middle of the basketball court at halftime , Cary had sworn never to touch another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right , Joe thought . He had heard that song before , more times than he cared to count . They all had . But this was the last straw . His dad knew  --  knew  --  that he was n't allowed near the horses if he 'd been drinking . Especially the Whistledown horses . Especially with Charles Haywood in residence . It was so dark that it was difficult to be certain , but the motionless figure seemed unaware of him as Joe stopped no more than a yard away and stared hard at it . A flicker of doubt assailed him : maybe it was n't his dad after all . The man looked too big , too burly , but then maybe the dark was deceptive . Suddenly , the only thing he was sure of  --  fairly sure of  --  was that whoever it was , was a man . Shoes , pants , the individual 's sheer size  --  all looked masculine . Legs thrust stiffly out in front of him , the guy was sitting on the ground , head turned a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms up on the ground . Joe thought his eyes were closed . Again , it was too dark to be sure , but he thought he would have seen a gleam of reflected light or something if the guy was looking at him . " Pop ? " he said , although he was almost positive now that the sitting figure was not his father . He caught a whiff of another smell foreign to the barn . It was sharper and more acrid , if not as familiar , as the booze . His voice hardened , sharpened . " All right , get up ! " The man did n't move . The reddish-brown sawdust looked almost black in the darkness . But all around the man 's right side , in a circular shape that seemed to be spreading even as Joe stared at it , was a deeper , denser blackness , an oily-looking blackness . . . . Joe 's eyes narrowed as he strained to see through the darkness . Moving nearer , crouching , he laid a wary hand on the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the man , totally unresponsive . " Hey , " Joe said , gripping the shoulder and shaking it . Then , louder : " Hey , you ! " The man 's head flopped forward , and then his torso slumped bonelessly away from Joe , his leather coat making a slithering sound as it moved over the wood . He ended up bent sideways at the waist , limp as a rag doll , his head resting at the outermost edge of the oily-looking circle . That posture was definitely not natural , Joe thought . The man had to be dead drunk  --  or dead . Oh Jesus . Dead . All around him now horses stomped and snorted and called in a constant , agitated chorus . He could feel their nervousness , their recognition that something was wrong in their world . The hair on the back of his neck prickled as he felt it too : the sensation he had first experienced upon entering the barn . The best way he knew to describe it was the weight of another presence . Glancing swiftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight and the bobbing heads of horses behind him , it occurred to him just how very isolated the barn was . There was a movie Eli liked . Joe could n't remember the name of it right off the top of his head , but the tag line went something like this : In space they ca n't hear you scream . That about summed up how he felt as he crouched there in the dark beside the slumped , motionless figure . He felt the touch of invisible eyes like icy fingers on his skin , and glanced around again . He could see nothing but the horses , and the shadows , and the moonlight pouring through the door . But a sudden fierce certainty that he was not alone seized him . " Who 's there ? " he called sharply . There was no reply . Had he really expected that there would be ? Mouth compressing , he turned his attention back to the man before him . Touching the oily sawdust , he discovered , as he had suspected , that whatever had discolored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sharp , rotting-meat stench of it was unmistakable as he held his fingers beneath his nose . " Jesus Christ , " Joe said aloud , wiping his fingers on the sawdust to clean them . Then he reached for the man 's neck , feeling for the carotid artery , for a pulse . Nothing , though the flesh was warm . At the same time he leaned over the still figure , squinting at the shadowed features . By that time , his eyes were as adjusted to the dark as they were going to get . He could not see everything  --  small details escaped him , and colors  --  but he could see some things . Like the fact that the guy 's eyes were definitely closed , and his mouth was open , with a black froth that could only be blood bubbling up from inside . Charles Haywood . Joe took a deep , shaken breath as he recognized his employer . There was a blackened hole about the size of a dime in his left temple , a growing circle of blood-soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a handgun lying not six inches from his left hand . What he had smelled along with the booze was the acrid scent of a recently fired gun , Joe realized . Haywood had been shot dead .
