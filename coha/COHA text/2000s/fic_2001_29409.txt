Nolan was nearly an hour late by the time he arrived at the Central Government Activities Complex , and even here his way was blocked . Throngs of tourists , lines of determined security guards , and pockets of news reporters clustered in front of every entrance to the huge red granite building that dominated the city skyline . Trying to be polite about it , Nolan edged his way past blueskin security forces , gulden spectators , and journalists of both races . This was one of the rare mornings he had to show an I.D . to enter the building . " Name ? " the guard questioned while he fumbled for his badge . " Nolan Adelpho . " The guard checked a clipboard . " Adelpho . Indigo male , " he muttered , marking off something on his sheet . " Reason for admittance to the Complex ? " Finally . In his left trouser pocket . Nolan pulled out his badge and handed it over . " I work at the Biolab . " The guard scrutinized the I.D. , examined Nolan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him inside . Even the interior corridors were crowded , and the elevator was crammed with both indigo and gulden individuals . Nolan felt a sense of relief when he was finally able to disembark on the fourteenth floorwhich , by eerie contrast , at first appeared totally deserted . Still , even the empty halls seemed electric with anticipation , and faint laughter floated to him from three rooms away . " Hello ? " he called out , trying to guess where everyone was . " Here , " someone shouted . " Melina 's room . " He made hisway through a maze of closed offices , open labs , and storage closets to the long , narrow room where Melina worked . About twenty people were pressed against the window , heads craned down to see the street below . As in the elevator , the company here was mixedfive indigo men , five indigo women , six gulden men , and a trio of albinos . The indigo presented a range of skin tones from the darkest navy to the palest sky blue , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gulden , on the other hand , were almost uniformly the same deep gold hue , though they sported a variety of hair color that was amazing to Nolanblond , red , orange , brown , silver , and bronze . The whitemen , who kept to themselves at the far end of the window , were harder to distinguish one from the other . Even after working with three of them for five years , Nolan sometimes had trouble telling them apart . Only Pakt turned to greet Nolan when he walked in the door . " You 're earlier than I thought you 'd be , " he said with a grin . " I 'd figured you could n't make it for another hour . " " I was beginning to think that myself . The Centrifuge was so crowded that people were sharing ringcars with strangers . And once I got off at the gate , all the trolleys were packed . It was quicker to walk , so I did . What 's going on ? " Pakt gestured at the window with one broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscular , heavy-boned , and powerful ; his tarnished-copper hair was long and a little wild but beginning to show gray . He radiated competence , self-confidence , health , and zest ; and he was the first gulden man Nolan had ever spoken to in a real conversation . It had been quite a shock . Blueskin men were much more reserved than this . " We 're expecting Chay Zanlan to arrive any minute , " Pakt said . " All the fools have lined up to gawk from the sidelines . You 'd think there 'd never been a gulden man set foot in the city before . " " Chay Zanlan never has , has he ? " asked Melina , briefly mining away from the window . " Not that I remember . " " Yes , he came to Jex 's graduation from City College , " said Colt , another gulden . " But that was ten years ago or more . " " And the spectacle was just as grand , " Pakt added . " You do n't remember it because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finer points of cruelty , bigotry , and the subjugation of men . " Melina favored him with one bright , impudent glance . " And learning them well , " she said before turning her attention back to the parade below . She was a high-caste blueskin with incredibly fine cobalt skin and the blackest imaginable hair , which she kept trimmed so close to the scalp that the shape of her skull showed through . In her mid-twenties , she was the youngest engineer in the laband the most outrageous . Pakt , her supervisor , constantly needled her about her patrician background , and she would enthusiastically enter verbal battle with him at a moment 's notice . Everyone adored her , Pakt included . " So is he actually here ? " Nolan asked , stepping forward and pushing between Melina and Colt to look out the window . All he could see were mobs of security forces and throngs of people pressing against a yellow cordon . " I do n't think I 'd recognize him if I saw him . " " Ca n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Pakt , he was a strongly built guldman , though younger , slimmer , and more athletic . His hair was a metallic yellow , shoulder length , and always carefully groomed . Nolan liked him , but Colt made him just a little nervous . As if some day Colt 's sardonic calm would explode into ferocity over some insult so slight Nolan would not be able to reconstruct it . " Well , Chay Zanlan 's got bright red hair , and yours is a sickly blond , so that 's how I tell you two apart , " Melina answered instantly . " Otherwise , you know , you 're dead ringers . " " Chay Zanlan also has a more regal bearing than our friend Colt , " Pakt said , earning a sideways smile from the other guldman . " At any rate , Chay Zanlan appears to be nowhere on the streets , " Melina said . " When is he supposed to arrive , anyway ? " Others at the window offered their guesses . " By now , I thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in last night , but they kept it a secret . " " Well , how much longer can we stand here looking out the window and wondering ? " Melina asked . " No longer , I hope , " drawled a new voice from the doorway , and in one convulsive movement , they all turned to face the speaker . Cerisa Daylen stood there unsmiling , her long black hair pulled back severely from her aristocratic face , her long thin fingers upping against her crossed arms . Every inch of her bespoke her Higher Hundred heritage , from her rich blueskin tone to her contemptuous expression . She was head of the lab , the most gifted biologist of their century , and every one of them hated her without reservation . " Time to go back to work , " Pakt said in a pleasant voice , and everyone except Melina sidled for the door . Cerisa stepped to one side to allow them room to pass , but she kept her reproving gaze on Pakt . The guldman smiled back at her , unimpressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everyone wants to see . " " There 's a plague killing children in the albino slums , " she answered without inflection . " I 'd say that 's a little more important than watching Chay Zanlan disrupt an entire city . " " Indeed it is , " Pakt answered . " And we 're all working on it . And we 'll let you know the instant we discover anything worth reporting . " If Cerisa made a reply to that , Nolan did n't hear it , having escaped far enough to shut out the sound of voices . He was inside his own lab in moments , a pristine , orderly environment that smelled of chemicals , books , and electronics . Technically , the job of isolating the albino virus would fall to Hiram , one of the other blueskin researchers , but all of them would try their hand at it until someone came up with a vaccine or a cure . That had been Cerisa Daylen 's great breakthrough , twenty years ago : a cure for a virulent disease that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children for decades . Mysteriously , the corrigio plague had had no effect on the gulden race , not even in milder symptoms . Cerisa Daylen had made her name on that discovery , but it was only one of many of her contributions to medical research . She had concocted a variety of antibiotics to combat a wide array of major and minor illnesses , she had led the battle for universal and mandatory inoculations against specific diseasesand she had fought for the continued funding and operation of the Biolab . Nolan had first come across her work in the journals he studied back in-country , when he was still convincing his mother that he wanted to become a biologist . He had read everything he could find about Cerisa Daylen , studied her experiments , replicated them as best he could in the inferior conditions of his homemade lab . When his scientific test scores outpulled those of every student in every upper school in-country , male and female , his mother reluctantly agreed to let him study medical research at Inrhio State University . Upon graduation , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her talented group of researchers . As far as he knew , no one who had not attended City College had ever been chosen for such an exalted position . He had been shocked when he received her letter . " Come to me no later than next month . We have a lab ready for you and work piled up . If your mother objects , I will persuade her . " He had made no mention of his mother in his letter of application , but Cerisa Daylen , of course , was bone and offspring of that select , unyielding , tradition-bound indigo matriarchy . She would know without being told how reluctant any woman would be to send her son off to such questionable work in the city . Indeed , Nolan was positive that only the fact that Cerisa was a Higher Hundred indigo woman permitted him to be at the Biolab today . Had she been a mid-caste woman or even a high-caste man , his mother would have refused to allow him to go . Had the lab been run by a gulden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been out of the question . So Cerisa Daylen had been his heroine , until he actually met her . Then , like everyone else who worked for her , he hated her , resented her , rebelled against her , and learned from her every single day . In the past five years , she had allowed Nolan to develop his own area of expertise , which was , rather unexpectedly , the gulden immune system . He had first become intrigued by it when studying Cerisa Daylen 's papers on the corrigio plague which only affected the white and blue races . Why not the gulden ? What was different about their bodies and their blood ? There were hundreds of other diseases to which they were susceptible ; why not this one ? He had conducted thousands of experiments to answer just these questions , and he had been the one to discover two potent antibiotics that shut down ill-natured bacteria that favored the elderly gulden . To date it was his proudest accomplishment . Though he had not shared the news with his mother . Indiscriminately saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular mark of achievement . In any case , she was merely counting the days till he came back to Inrhio and married his fiance , Leesa , when all the world , as far as she was concerned , would be back in its proper orbit and continuing on its preordained course . But that would not be for some time yet . Not today , at any rate . Nolan shut himself into his office , flicked on his computer , and began the new day 's chores . During lunch hour , most of them crammed back into Melina 's office to watch the street theater again . As far as they could tell , Chay Zanlan had not yet arrived , or else the crowds on the street were hanging around hoping for a glimpse of him when he reemerged . " So why exactly is he here ? " Melina asked , directing the question at Pakt . She , Nolan , Colt , Pakt , and a blueskin woman named Varella were sitting around her desk , sharing food and idle conversation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son , Jex , who is in jail , " Pakt said , stating the obvious with exaggerated patience . They all knew Jex Zanlan was in jail . He had been arrested three months ago after setting off a bomb that had destroyed a medical compound near the West Two gate of the Centrifuge . " And a damn good thing Jex Zanlan is in jail , " Melina retorted . " But does Chay Zanlan expect to negotiate his release with Ariana Bayless ? " " Ultimately , " Pakt said . " But I think Mayor Bayless and her council will make him sweat it out a little longer . " " Why would she ever release him ? " Varella asked . She was a paler , frailer version of Melina , not as smart , not as beautiful , not as lively . But likable nonetheless , Nolan always thought . " This gives her more leverage over Chay Zanlan than she 's ever had , and she 's within her rights to keep him . I mean , he did try to blow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives him up , she 'll be able to expect a powerful return gift from Chay , " Pakt said . " And any number of gifts spring to mind , " Colt added . " Foremost being rights to the Carbonnier Extension . " " But not far behind is her desire to add a new ring to the Centrifuge , " Pakt said . " Chay could make her a gift of the construction stone , since it 's quarried in Geldricht . For that , Ariana Bayless just might release Jex Zanlan . " Melina was shaking her head . " I will never understand politics , " she said . " How you can balance lives against commerce will always elude me . I could never make such a bargain . " " Fortunately , Ariana Bayless is not so squeamish , " Pakt said dryly . " Chay , I am sure , is counting on it . " " You keep calling him Chay , ' " Varella said a little irritably . " Do you actually know him ? " Colt was grinning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have a very personal stake in our leader . We like to feel we could walk up to him any day and have a serious conversation with him , man to man . " Melina gave Varella a significant look . " Not woman to man , you 'll notice . " Colt gave an exaggerated shrug and spoke in an arrogant tone that was meant to annoy . " No gulden woman , no matter how schooled , would ever know as much as her husband , her brother , or her father . " " Whereas my husband , brother , and father , all sitting together in one room , pooling their limited intellectual resources , would never have the ability to make a worthwhile decision in Inrhio , " Melina said loftily . Pakt sent an amused sideways glance at Nolan . " Poor emasculated fools , " he said . " Letting their women cut them off at the balls . " Nolan smiled back a little uncertainly . He was clearly the outsider in this group , the only member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power base . In Inrhio , women controlled the wealth , the land , the successioneverything . Inheritances passed through the hands of the mother ; she chose who her daughters would marry and bargained with her neighboring matriarchs for brides for her sons . In Geldricht , though , it was the men who had absolute power . The women were , as far as Nolan had been able to observe , shamefully abused and degraded . He could not imagine what honor accrued to a man who beat his wife or mistreated his children . Among the indigo , although the matriarchy controlled the pattern of life , men were cherished and valued . And children were considered a treasure past price . " Not emasculated , " Nolan said gallantly , " gratefully admitted to a wide circle of fascinating and elegant women . " The women cooed and clapped their hands ; the men were loudly derisive . Melina patted him on the shoulder . " Does Leesa know what a sweet boy you are ? Does she appreciate you ? " Colt pointed at Nolan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was bred to be by you and all the rest of you women . He 's no different from any other downtrodden blueskin man I 've ever met . " " Well , if you think that , you have n't met that many indigo boys , " Varella murmured , and Melina added a heartfelt " so true . " Varella added , " Nolan is sweet , you know . A lot of the blueskins back in-country areagreeable , let 's saybut there 's something special about Nolan . He means it when he says things like that . " " No one could mean it , " Colt informed her . Nolan turned to Pakt . " This happens to me all the time . People talk about me when I 'm sitting right here . " " Does n't happen to me , " Pakt said with a grin . " I guess I 'm a little harder to overlook . " " Harder to like , " Melina said . " But then , you do n't much like any man , " Pakt responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Melina laughed . For the past six months , she had been living with a female lover , a jahla girl , as the indigo called it . Varella , Nolan , and the other blueskins had treated the news with the mild , courteous interest they showed in the rotating love lives of all their fellow workers , but the guldmen had been repelled and outraged . Melina and Colt had had a huge fight about it , in fact , a screaming match that had made stupefied coworkers come running down the halls in time to see Melina hit Colt in the chest with her balled-up fist . To which Colt had replied with a slap across her face that sent her stumbling four feet back into the wall . Pakt had dashed between them before either could strike again , muscling Colt back toward the door , holding Melina off with one imperious hand . " Youwillnot , " he had stated in the dead-cold fury they had all learned to fear , " moveor speakeither one of you ! until I say you may . Nolan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind you . You two . Sit . I said sit . " And that was all any of the rest of them had been privileged to witness , though they milled about in the halls for the next half hour , whispering over what they had overheard . It still astonished Nolan that anyone could care one way or the other if one woman chose to love another . Among the indigo , jahla girls were common ; even married women often preferred the company of a jahla partner , relying on their husbands only for financial advantages , social connections , biological contributions to pregnancy , and , sometimes , companionship . On the other hand , Nolan was revolted at the male homosexuality he had heard of among the guldmen . The only proper object of love for a man or a woman , or so he had learned from the cradle , was a woman . For a man to love another man was unthinkable , gruesome , actually sickening . He did not know any homosexual guldmen , of course ; he did not think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the face . He might work up the nerve to ask Pakt about it some day . Pakt was the most broad-minded person Nolan had ever come across , male , female , blue , gold , or white . If Pakt could not explain society to him , no one could , for Pakt understood everything and everyone . Pakt had calmed down Colt and Melina on that violent day , though it had been weeks before the two were reconciled enough to speak civilly to each other . Even now there was an edge between them much of the time , a pointed banter that was not nearly as playful as the teasing that Pakt and Melina tossed to each other . Yes , Nolan was sure of it , one day Colt would explode , and there would be no telling how far that destructive blast would blow them all . " I like men , " Melina was saying now to Pakt . " Not you and Colt , of course , but some men . Nolan . " " Hiram , " Colt said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and apologetic light-skinned indigo ; he was difficult even for the other blueskins to love . " I can tolerate Hiram , " Melina said calmly . " There are men I like better . And I do n't only like indigo men , though I have to admit they make more sense to me than you two wild creatures . " Colt leaned forward . " Because we 're real men , and you ca n't make us fit into your dainty little patterns , " he breathed . " Colt , " she said coolly , " have no fear . No one in the world would be fool enough to try to make you over . So relax . You are safe from me . " The others laughed . Colt drew back , looking annoyed . Before anyone else could speak , there was a shout from across the room . " Look ! There he is ! There he is ! " The five of them bounded to their feet and ran to the window . A phalanx of bodies was exiting from the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight , human wall of security around one central figure , and it was difficult to make out anything of the ruler from this elevation and angle . Nolan got an impression of height and massa big man , this Chay Zanlan , bigger than Pakt , with thick shoulders and broad thighstopped by a crown of fiery red hair . The gulden ruler was dressed in bright colors , as were his attendants , and their loose tunics snapped gaily around them as they strode by . Moments later , a second cadre of officials emerged . This time , they were all blueskins , dressed in black and white and wearing their formal clan colors in sashes and shawls . Ariana Bayless was in the center of the group , taller than all the other women and most of the men , her blue-black hair glinting like mica in the afternoon sun . She was speaking to one woman as she walked , reaching a hand out to another woman who offered her a briefcase , and gesturing impatiently to a man who trailed behind her , obviously trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asking how the conference went . " Well , things appear to be going smoothly enough , " Nolan commented . Only Pakt appeared to have overheard , for the guldman raised an eyebrow at him . " They have n't killed each other yet ; at any rate , " he said . " But there 's a lot of room left for trouble . " " What do you mean ? " " How would you feel if you were negotiating for your sister 's life with Cerisa Daylen ? Because Ariana Bayless comes from the same mold , and it 's not a friendly one . " " If she gave her word , " Nolan said slowly . He had not previously considered this ; he 'd had no cause to picture himself feinting with either the head of the Biolab or the mayor of the city . " She would honor it . " Pakt was nodding . " To the letter , " he said . " Well , then , " Nolan said , and shrugged . He turned back to the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . That turned out to be the last of the excitement for the day . Even the trip home on the Centrifuge that night was less eventful . As always , there was a big crowd at the North Zero gate , the stop closest to both the Complex and the entertainment district . Unlike this morning , however , commuters were not sharing ringcars with strangers , so the line moved slowly . Nolan had a long wait on the inside of the gate and stared unseeingly at the vast , curved walls of the Centrifuge unfolding to either side of him . Finally , a ringcar pulled up before him , and its driver left the vehicle . Nolan climbed into the small , spherical cocoon , all metal and glass on the outside , merely a bench and a set of hand controls inside . He pulled the rudder to the left , and the car glided into the entry lane , the middle of the three traffic levels . As soon as the lane above him cleared out , he pulled the rudder back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . The great stone hallway of the Centrifuge unrolled before him , honey yellow , filled with a bee 's hive of scurrying shapes , curving to the left in a continuous unbroken circle . The gates flashed by on his right , and he skimmed along in the highest lane until he reached his own . Then he dropped to the middle level , pulled up at the gate , and exited onto the street . From there , he took a slow , lumbering bus to his own neighborhood . It was the fashionable district for indigo bachelors . Nearly everyone on the bus was dressed in clothes remarkably similar to Nolan 's , and they all lived in apartment buildings that he easily could have mistaken for his own . A few miles away were the expensive multistory houses where the Higher Hundred families lived when they were in the city , but for an unmarried blueskin man , this was the only acceptable place to live . There was a small pile of mail awaiting Nolan outside the door to his apartment . Bills ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribed to , though he rarely read it . And a note from Leesa . He opened that first . As he read , he absently toyed with the medallion he wore , a disk stamped with Leesa 's clan device , which she had given him the day they became engaged . Her handwriting was large , looped , and lazy . Every time he read it , he imagined her speaking in her usual languid , unimpassioned tones , and he automatically slowed the pace at which he consumed her words . " Nolan : Is it as hot in the city as it is in-country ? Today Bettahelia and I did nothing but sit on the porch drinking lemonade and watching the wind move the grass in the field . We did n't even speak more than five sentences to each other , and she was with me the entire day . I think her visit has gone on too long , but I 've been too fatigued to tell her so . Maybe she will leave by the end of the week . " Did I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some boring investment trouble that mother wants me to see to personally . As long as I have to make the trip , though , I may as well stay a few days . With you , of course , unless there 's some sly bachelor reason you do n't want me in your quarters . Or if you ca n't bother to clean them , then I 'll stay in a hotel . But of course I 'd rather be with you . " Corzehia is planning to be in the city for the rest of the summer , so I 'm going to write her , as well . She 's having some big party that I think we can go to . Otherwise , you 'll have to think of entertainments for me . I 'll try to be easy to amuse . " I 'll let you know when I 'm to arrive . Put your lips to the paper right under my signaturethat 's where I 've left you a kiss . " Analeesa " Nolan read the letter a second time , then dutifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at least once a week , letters much like this one , with little information , light humor , and easy affection . He wrote her back at least as often , though sometimes he was at a loss as to what to say . She cared very little about his job , though she always assured him she was pleased to hear how well he was doing , When he had formulated the gulden antibiotics and had reported Cerisa 's praise , Leesa had sent him a finely embroidered shirt as a celebratory gift . And yet , he could scarcely give her a day-by-day account of his activities at the lab ; she could not possibly understand his pursuit and attack of cells and tissues . So news about the lab was minimal . And he did not have much to tell her about his social life . A few times a week , he played curfball with men in the neighboring building , and sometimes they met to play cards or go for dinner . Now and then he lingered in the city after dosing hours to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could mention to Leesa , but he could hardly recount a stroke-by-stroke description of his curfball game or an item-by-item dissection of his meal . And she had no interest in the theater , so he rarely bothered to give her long reviews of these nights . And he had never mentioned the fact that he had , more than once , gone with his fellow employees to Pakt 's house for a meal and a convivial evening . It would not have occurred to Leesa that there were any circumstances under which an indigo man would have social dealings with a guldmanwould walk into his house , sit at his table , eat his food . She could scarcely comprehend the fact that Nolan worked in harmony with half a dozen gulden men , and she had literally refused to acknowledge that a guldman could be his superior in the workplace . She would have disbelieved him if he had told her he had gone to Pakt 's house for dinner and enjoyed himself very much . Before he had come to the city , Nolan would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an event . Before he had come to the city , Nolan had seen maybe a dozen gulden in his life , and he had always had to restrain himself from staring . It was not polite to gawk at someone strange , inferior , and unfortunate , his mother had drilled into him . The courteous thing to do would be to act as if you did not notice such a person 's defects , did not realize that his gold skin and fair hair doomed him to a life of misery and worthlessness . Treat any gulden you encounter ( though there were not many in-country and almost none in the lush lands where the Higher Hundred had their estates ) with the cheerful compassion you would give to a mute child , an injured dog , a feebleminded old man . And never let him realize how terribly sorry you feel for him . His mother , of course , was widely considered to be the most broad-minded of women . Most of the other indigo matriarchsand their spousescould not bring themselves to speak of the gulden with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparingly , virtually every other term of opprobrium was casually applied to members of the gulden race . A guldman was a thing to sometimes fear , always revile , and certainly avoid . So when Nolan came to the city , he was astonished . Not only did gulden walk the city streets as if they had every right to be there , they ate in blueskin restaurants and patronized blueskin shops , and no one questioned them as long as they had the cash to pay their way . They could be found in any profession , though they tended toward the more scientific and mechanical pursuits ; they were engineers , chemists , architects . They were also lawyers , restaurateurs , political appointeesin short , they were everywhere . The albinos , too , were far more visible than they had ever been in Inrhio . In-country , the whitefolk routinely held menial positionsgardener , nursemaid , chauffeuralthough the very high-caste indigo preferred to hire low-caste blueskins for those positions if they could . Nolan 's mother had often said a good albino housekeeper was worth any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an albino man with any job around the house . But she had warned her children against trying to make friends with the whitefolk . They were trustworthy , but they were still foreign . But in the city it was a different story . The albinos kept mostly to themselves in small enclaves in the northern and western edges of the city . Here , however , they were not just domestic helpers but acute businessmen , running affluent shops that catered to the whims of guldmen and blueskins alike . They led tidy , quiet lives and mingled freely with the other two races , causing no dissension . Unlike the gulden , whoit seemed to Nolancaused dissension everywhere . Sudden violence seemed to swirl around the gulden like a windswept aureole of danger . One man would kill another , suddenly , for no reason , in the middle of the street in the middle of the day . And , Nolan could n't count how many news stories he had heard of gulden children slaughtered in the women 's ghetto on the west edge of town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the city specifically for the purpose of hunting down this particular woman and her hapless clutch of children . Ariana Bayless had decided long ago that gulden crimes against gulden residents should be judged and punished by peers . So the city officials did little to curtail these acts of violence . Gulden men and gulden ways ; that was no business of indigo lawmakers . None of it made any sense to Nolan . But he did not have to understand the gulden . He merely had to coexist with them , as civilly as possible , until his abbreviated life in the city was done . And then he would return in-country , marry Leesa , and live the life he had been destined for . And that , he was very sure , was a life that would hold no surprises .
