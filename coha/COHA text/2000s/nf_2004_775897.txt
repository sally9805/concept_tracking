Excerpt // Introduction // Patrick 's Life and Letters // Fifteen centuries ago an old man in Ireland wrote two of the most remarkable letters surviving from ancient times . Patrick had labored for decades as a priest and bishop on this island at the end of the world - labored , in spite of constant threats of slavery and death , to bring a new faith to a people beyond the realm of the crumbling Roman Empire . He also faced harassment from church officials abroad who thought him inadequate to the task and were perhaps jealous of his success . In spite of these difficulties , he succeeded in bringing a new way of life to the Irish people . Today millions around the world remember him every year during celebrations on St. Patrick 's Day . // Yet what is he remembered for ? Driving the snakes out of Ireland , entering contests to the death with pagan Druids , using the shamrock as an aid to explain the Trinity - all these are pious fictions created centuries later by well-meaning monks . The true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legends . This story is known best from two short letters written by Patrick himself , his Letter to the Soldiers of Coroticus and Confession . // That we possess these two remarkable documents at all is the result of Patrick being forced in his later years to write , first , a letter of appeal and condemnation to a slave-raiding king and his band of mercenary pirates and , second , a defense of his work against accusations by fellow churchmen . Though Patrick wrote neither of these letters as history or autobiography , they contain fascinating and precious bits of information about his own life as well as about Ireland during a turbulent age . The two letters are in fact the earliest surviving documents written in Ireland and provide us with glimpses of a world full of petty kings , pagan gods , quarreling bishops , brutal slavery , beautiful virgins , and ever-threatening violence . But more than anything else , they allow us to look inside the mind and soul of a remarkable man living in a world that was both falling apart and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other documents from ancient times that give us such a clear and heartfelt view of a person 's thoughts and feelings . These are , above all else , letters of hope in a trying and uncertain time . // The details that Patrick gives us of his life are few and often tantalizingly vague , but what we do know is this : He was born a Roman citizen in Britain in the late fourth century A.D. His grandfather was a priest , and his father was both a Christian deacon and a Roman decurion , an important local magistrate . He received at least a basic education in Latin , as would any son of the Roman upper class . As a teenager he committed an unnamed sin so horrendous that it almost destroyed his career decades later in Ireland . Soon after this sin , at the age of fifteen , he was kidnapped by Irish pirates from his family 's villa in Britain near a place named Bannaventa Berniae , transported across the Irish Sea , and sold into slavery along with many of his family 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep day and night for a single master . He experienced a gradual but profound spiritual awakening during these years as a slave . This awakening included visions and warnings that he believed came directly from God and that would continue throughout his life . He escaped from Ireland on a ship of pagan sailors and eventually made his way back to his family in Britain . // Later he returned to Ireland to spread the Christian gospel and was made a bishop . He preached in areas that had not previously known any missionary work , and he had many converts , including the sons and daughters of Irish kings , but many of his flock seem to have been female slaves . He experienced enormous difficulties , including threats , kidnapping , robbery , and other violence . At some point in his later years , a group of his newly baptized converts were killed or taken into slavery by a petty British king named Coroticus , prompting his Letter to the Soldiers of Coroticus . Also later in his life , he was accused by his fellow churchmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Confession . // But the letters of Patrick are not the only sources available for uncovering the story of his life and times . Archaeological excavations and discoveries shed a great deal of light on Roman Britain and early Ireland . Greek and Roman writers , although they never specifically mention Patrick , are marvelous aids in fleshing out the world he lived in . Later Irish traditions on Patrick , though full of legendary material , also preserve bits and pieces of genuine information . Taken together with his letters , these sources tell the story of an extraordinary man living in a tumultuous age . //
