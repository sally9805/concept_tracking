Nearly 350 years ago Isaac Newton watched an apple fall to earth , giving birth ( in a manner of speaking ) to gravity , without which Nellie Fox might still be camping beneath an infield fly at the old Comiskey Park , punching his glove , staring at the Chicago sky and waiting to catch a baseball popped up in 1951. // " If I have seen further , " wrote Newton , " it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants . " He was acknowledging a debt not to ex-Giants infielder Manny Trillo but to other geniuses in his field , as Fox did when he said , " What is the top requirement for a second baseman ? A fine shortstop . I am fortunate in having the greatest shortstop in baseball , Luis Aparicio. " // All of which is to say that sports , like most worthwhile human endeavors , teach us to appreciate  --  to Apariciate  --  our fellow man , which is a good thing , for people are connected in ways you might never imagine . // Sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hatchet with Yankees nemesis Lou Piniella by saying , " Let 's let bye-byes be bye-byes . " But sports give everyone a shot at salvation . " The best thing about baseball , " Trillo once said , " is that you can do something about yesterday tomorrow . " // And while that is a hopeful thought for all of us resolving to reinvent ourselves in the New Year , it 's not quite the best thing about baseball . The best thing about baseball is  --  and forever will be  --  ballpark food . " A hot dog at the ballpark , " Humphrey Bogart said , " is better than a steak at the Ritz . " // Still , as we gorge ourselves this holiday season , sports urge us to have a modesty of wants . In an age when athletes often call to mind Minnie the Moocher  --  who dreamed , in Cab Calloway 's cautionary tale , of a " home built of gold and steel , a diamond car with platinum wheels "  --  we 'd do well to remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract negotiation , " All I 'm asking for is what I want . " // In life , as in sports , there are any number of ways to get what you want . Conrad Hilton became as rich as the monocled man in Monopoly by starting  --  as in Monopoly  --  with a single hotel . " Successful people , " he said , " keep moving . They make mistakes but do n't quit . " Failure , in other words , is an option , and always should be . " Anytime you try to win everything , " said Larry Csonka , who won everything with the undefeated ' 72 Miami Dolphins , " you must be willing to lose everything . " // When hard work fails , try shortcuts . Just before he retired this year , Georgia State basketball coach Lefty Driesell lamented that one of his players , ineligible with a 1.86 grade point average , was only .04 of a point shy of the required 1.90 .

But as a result he has withdrawn from school and is preparing to enter the NFL draft , where the Razorback will be enormously enriched by a set of football skills that scouts are calling sui  --  or is it sooey ?  --  generis. // And who can blame him ? In the end sports are whatever you want them to be . They 're at once meaningless and meaningful . Like Little Richard singing " A **32;0;TOOLONG , " sports say nothing and everything , are nonsense and Americana. // They ought not to be taken too seriously . Years ago Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler told the Modesto Bee that he had , the night before a start in New York , sat in a bar until 8 a.m. , then cabbed directly to the stadium . There , Jets quarterback ( and fellow Alabama alum ) Richard Todd , running into Stabler before kickoff , said in surprise , " You smell of whiskey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been out drinking all night . " // Some people are scandalized by such behavior . Others feel , as Bogart said , " The whole world is about three drinks behind . " In this week of holidays and holiday parties , when Three Wise Men can mean the Magi or the cocktail ( a mix of Johnnie , Jack and Jim ) , it is possible to embrace the philosophies of Jesus ( " Do unto others " ) and Jimmy Buffett , who sang , " Ho ho ho and a bottle of rum/Santa 's run off to the Caribbean/A week in the tropics and he 'll be all right/Sportin ' a tan as he rides out of sight . " // History , after all , is an endless elephant caravan , connecting disparate people across time and cultures in ways that never cease to surprise . And so we 'd like to wish Happy Holidays  --  and Happy Birthday  --  to Isaac Newton , Nellie Fox , Manny Trillo , Rickey Henderson , Humphrey Bogart , Cab Calloway , Conrad Hilton , Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jesus and Jimmy Buffett , all of whom were born on Christmas Day . // If that sounds like a kicker from The Twilight Zone , all the better because Rod Serling was born on Christmas Day too . // So was Robert Ripley , believe it or not .
