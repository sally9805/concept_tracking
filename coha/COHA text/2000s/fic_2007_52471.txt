HE WOULD FALL ASLEEP and wake up again . The old engine was loud . The setting sun shone strange and brown through the tinted glass . They had been at the others " house all afternoon , and he did not know if they were going home or somewhere else . His brothers were in the backseat . They could sleep soundly in the roaring , swerving car . He could n't . His head bumped against the glass , and when the sun flickered through the passing trees he could not fall asleep . The radio was broken . The sun was warm on their brown freckled skin ; they all had the same brown skin that bruised like bananas . He would fall asleep for a moment , and the glass would bump his head , and he would wake and see the sun flicker off the warm brown skin of his driving mama . Her great big sunglasses . He loved his wild , dangerous mama . They went to her scary tuft of poison friends " crowded house so many times . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mama drive away after too many beers . He saw her drink and knew what beer was . That smell . Yelling . But they were so young , they were happy to be in the rumbling car . His warm , loud , funny mama . How she smelled and laughed . He went to sleep again and woke up again as he watched her drive and smile . He put his feet in her lap , and she put her hand on his feet , and he was glad even though he did not know where they were going or how his brothers could sleep so well cuddling in the backseat . He would sit out on the grass in his oily shorts with the wind hissing through all the pine trees so their little clumps of needles flouncing looked like darts stuck in flying . The yard was cluttered with a trashy culch of broken plastic and wet string and wet newspaper . Greasy black birds picked around the yard and the stinking steel trash cans . The wind 's sonorous moving and the hundreds of chattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the things . The blue and yellow flowers . What they called the finger trees , the bug leg trees , the sticky bush . The bole of his skinny arms and long legs , long thin rabbit-like feet hammered through the woods and took his supple , young brown body into harsh prodding in tall yards and tough thickets . His feet would puncture and bleed . The sticky bush and scratching nettles . He tried to trap little animals like frogs or birds if he could , and was not always kind to the helpless things . Gathering them into the bent-up , rust-speckled steel house that their mama 's third boyfriend put together out in the woods . " Little fuckers , " he 'd snap at them , as they tried to scratch or bite out of his sinewy , dirt-packed hands . " Whatcha gon na do now with " im ? " His brothers would always look to him for ideas , dumbly poking around in the yard while he chopped through the woods . They stayed close to the house . Fill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd throw a bottle at them and yell , " Cunts ! " and splash into the edge of the forest . They 'd yell , " Asshole ! " and run after him a little bit but never go far into the woods . Or just wind around the steel house , as if he would just go right back there . Try to outsmart him . They liked to call it " the steel house . " The furrowed sheet metal and the cheap soft wood . The loud baseball seeds smashed into the roof in the spring and made it impossible to sleep . Also at night when the bugs sounded like choruses of buzzing kitchen lights and cell phones , with enormous trucks farting across the roads at all hours . They knew when they had to stay out of the real house all day and sleep in the steel house . First with James , the worst because it was the first , and then every one since then . There was a jar in the corner with a praying mantis in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it died . They called it " him , " too . Everything they caught was a boy . The shoots of weeds that stuck up in green cowlicks around the big , real house were stuffed with anonymous action figures from cartoons everyone had forgotten about . And guns that were made from branches . He had gotten into the compacted garage and pulled a blade off of the broken lawnmower to use in cutting paths . He was slapped with a wooden hanger for it . He bent and lost it anyway . Uh fack , uh god , fuck . Yes . Uh . A roseola of red clay spattered up by some rain on the outside back of the real house below her window . Waxy , shiny leaves of some unkind sharp bush stood there . They could hide in the bush , hear her , all day . That side of the house like Mars , chalky red dust always floating . Her laughter , shouting , from inside , and his brothers " futzing around and him trammeling up some screaming creature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them would pick one of the tough , sharp leaves off of a bush and slice it across the other 's back , get punched in the center of the chest . Struggling until crying throaty invectives , sobbing no apologies . The green spatterings on their young , rakishly beautiful thin bodies , their shared , warm-dark , freckled smooth skin the same , with scatters of bruises , scribbles of arcing scabs . They would fight and hide against the constant background of that ancient struggle perpetuated in her bedroom . Groaning eruptions and the spastic violence of desperate sex , loud from their funny , playful mama . They had a blue gray dog for a little while . But one of them kicked it for digging up a bird , and the fat man with the hairy stomach that curved out like the top of a giant balding head from his abdomen took it away and kicked them back . His gross , hairy thighs . Who killed that bird ? he wondered . That old fat man back ? he wondered . Whose car is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This her seventh boyfriend , is n't it ? The gray car sat in the gravel , its hood pocked . Cancered with little flakes of rust . Tin can wrinkled . Cooling engine ticking . A feral cat from the woods sniffing a tire . The dark-tinted glass . They 'd be driving in the huge thing , roaring through deep countryside to her friends " house or from there somewhere else . He 'd wiggle both feet under her right leg . Some strange shirt on the floor . Cans . " Whose car is it ? " he 'd asked . " Mine , honey . He gave it to me . " " Do you like him , Mama ? " " Yes baby , I love him . " Then he 'd be quiet for a while . His brothers flinching in their dreams . He 'd fall asleep and wake up again at a strange house with some foreign , uncomfortable smell . They laughed violently , staggering around the porch . Gravel of smashed bottles . Dog-chewed fluorescent tears of foam from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind . Sweat , beer . They stood around , smoke blotting up from the rumbling grill , and screamed their laughter at each other . Shouting vomited out of them like the purging of some hostile spirit : " Party ! " " Fuck me ! " He and his brothers learned that when anyone yelled excessively loudly for any reason at all , the others would cheer and laugh . Who does not want to roar at the mundane , break up the inundation of daily disappointment ? But the kids there were only confused . They threw rocks , smashed already broken things into the dirt . Ignored , they shouted , copied their parents , fought . A little pack of runts from various forgotten litters . They would feed perpetually on leftovers , steal the bottom , warm half of forgotten beers . " Give me that football , asshole ! " a spindly little thing with a red soda moustache yelled at his brother , pushing . He snatched the football and threw it as hard as he could at the kid 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The other boy blocked the ball with his dirty arms . His stringy hair fell in his face . A dog barking . Pounds of yellow dirt clouded around their scuffling . Minutes passed . His little brother would get pushed again when he was n't looking . Skinny boy in knee-length T-shirt flapping in the breeze , shooting off crab-wise . The dirty ranch-style house that so many of her friends stayed at had a sliding glass door that led out to the porch . Dogs and children always running unattended in and out . The adults and the kids inhabited parallel worlds in the little cluttered landscape of plastic chairs and coolers and seized-up lawnmowers . The adults were more oblivious to the kids " vicious dramas than the kids were to theirs . The young keep attentive to the unpredictable violence of raging grown-ups . He fought , and he watched his mama , the adults . What did they have to worry about out there ? Cracked shoulder blades and collarbones and glass scratches and deeptissue bruises . They could kick anything small out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . They sped toward recklessness . The insane intoxication of expenditure . Dancing and drinking themselves , the noisy adults , away from the ordinary reality of poverty . She spent so many afternoons or evenings there . They all did . He never wondered how all the adults made their living . His mother did n't work . All the men , they took care of his bright , warm mama . Gave her money . In impossible arrhythmic rotations . Where do they all come from ? he wondered . Where does she get them ? Some dark remuda of brutish , uncontrollable humans . All with thick strong wrists , great hairy fists , fat shoulders and stomachs . She liked them large and hairy and wild and brutal . They came around and made promises and gave things and then went away in a parade of names and struggle , rumbling in that bedroom where he and his brothers never went , where she almost always was when she was n't at that house . His feet smacked down on the cold tile of the supermarket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bread and apples . Rode in the wire caging below the buggy . Got his finger pinched in a wheel . Knocked over a soda . Everyone there was always so calm and smart . Kids from school would act like they did not know him or whisper to their siblings . He liked to mash his fingers into the plastic over the ground beef . And ask for free cookies from the bakery . There was a video section he would wander around in . His brothers always stayed with then-mama . One in the basket , one jumping along behind . But he liked to run around the store . Play with things and look at people . Vacation from the dirty homes . He looked at pictures of cars and motorcycles with girls leaning over them in magazines . Shook up settled jars of dressing . Stole cherries and grapes . He took a plastic spoon from an end display and smacked the shelves as he walked up and down the aisles . " What are you doing ? " A young girl and her mother appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skinny and brown like a little fawn . The posture of a weightless angel . He was embarrassed and stared at his dirty toenails while she said again , " Why are you doing that ? It 's so loud . " He did n't know what to say . Her mother was behind them . " Carrie , " she called . " Where are your shoes ? " the girl asked . She looked confused and disgusted . " Your mom lets you run around without any shoes on ? What 's wrong with her ? " " Fuck you , " he said . The girl gasped , yelled , " Mom ! Mom ! Come here ! Listen to what this boy said ! " To him she said , " I 'll tell your mom what you just said . " He wondered what school she went to . He had never seen her before . She was so beautiful and looked so clean and rich and smart . He hated her for being so foreign . Her mom came stomping over and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You do n't talk to people like that . " She kept ranting , and his sanity burned away in a little fever of shame . He took the large black plastic spoon and slapped the girl in the eye with the convex end-he did n't know why-then ran away from her shouting and crying . He ran around the store looking for his mother . Feet smacking up and down long aisles . The chilly frozen-food one . He found her with the potato chips . " Put it down right there ! " she said , after he had already hit the cart and one brother with the spoon several times . They walked around the store all in the same kind of stringy shorts and dirty little T-shirts , no shirt on the littlest brother . The cart was full of cheap frozen and instant food . He stuck by his mother now . A quick glimpse of the girl down one aisle . All the strangers walked so clean and pushed carts of exotic food he had never tasted . Standing in line for check-out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register , a man in a tie came and told his mother about his hitting the girl . Asked them to never come back . The groceries would be strewn all over the kitchen floor for days before anyone would put them up , usually one of her boyfriends . She 'd drop them there and run into the bedroom to shower . To get ready . He and his brothers would eat whatever stuff they wanted . One day they heard something in the kitchen . Something scratching in the walls or cabinets . They got quiet and listened , got low on the old stained tile . Gritty things stuck to their hands and knees . There was an old juice cup crammed beneath the refrigerator and a cough drop with cat hair on it in the corner . They slowly opened all of the cabinets but did n't see anything . They stayed quiet , listening , but then their mama came out of her room making a bunch of noise . One brother pointed , said he saw a little brown thing dart out from behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heater . He shot after it . His smallest brother leapt away , startled . Next few days they stayed in the kitchen , straining to hear through their mama 's spasmic groaning with some man where the scratching little thing might be . They balled up little wads of cheese and flicked them under the stove . Made a trail to lead it out to where they could get it . Ground cheese puff things into the tile near the water heater . One had a carving knife to slash it with . One a plastic shovel . He had a leather boot to knock its head off . They waited for days . Thought they heard it a million times . Finally , they put bits of baloney out . The brown thing must have liked that because it came out into the open , followed the line of food they 'd made . The two younger brothers would n't do anything . But he pounced on it and pinned it in place with his shirt so it would n't bite him . He took off the shirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swung it into the side of the house , right on the corner , he and his brothers laughing , some man inside yelling about who moved his boots again . The three brothers crouched together in the steel house with rain clanking down on its roof , bombing large drops into the mud around it . In the corner a jar stack of suffocating or starving insects glistened its own wet echo of the lightning . The youngest was half out the door , wriggling his fingers deep into the rocky mud . The middle brother just sitting there , staring out the crooked window that was torn into the wall . He gently and curiously pinched his fat , blood-sticky lip . They were all frowning . It was getting pretty dark . The man 's car was still in the driveway . The lights were on in her bedroom . There was no more shouting or fighting , but he heard moving around in the house . They watched shadows grow and die away . Lights blinked on and off in the kitchen , bathroom . The wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream . It was a hard ram , but he knew they had to stay out there . He looked at his brother 's little hand , squishing the mud , his hair snaking down flat against his wet forehead . There was a bruise on the younger one 's shoulder ; he remembered seeing it earlier , but now it was too dark . " Your lip still bleeding ? " the youngest one asked him . He looked back and shrugged . " Asshole , " he said . " That asshole . Why does she like him ? " " His fucking money " the middle one said . He was squatted above the dirt with his scratched-up arms around his knees . He licked his big sore lip . " Look at his shitty ass car , though . He ai n't got too much money . " The middle child unrolled the sleeping bag . Bugs were starting to sing . The middle and older boys lay down on the unfolded dirty thing . The youngest child was letting the rain wash the mud off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear some little trapped thing clinking around in a jar in the corner .
