The newspaper clipping was yellowed and tearing at the folds , though it had been handled carefully over the years by the detectives who worked the case or who , during the preceding decade , had taken a fresh look at the cold file , reading the missing report on Carson Chappell , and making additional inquiries . Unable to come up with any new leads , each had committed the folder once again to limbo among the department 's unresolved cases . <p> <p> Bridegroom vanishes before wedding <p> Local resident Carson Chappell , senior partner of the accounting firm of Chappell &amp; Gibbs , did not appear for his wedding on Sunday afternoon at Community Church and has not been heard from for nearly a week . His fiancTe , Lindsey Wolf , also of Molena Point , told reporters she last saw Chappell five days earlier , when he set out alone on a camping trip into state park land east of the village . . . <p> <p> The file contained a dozen such articles clipped from central California papers , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his case notes , random notes by the various officers who had later studied the case , and several human-interest pieces published over the intervening years . The fact that a well-known accountant and financial adviser had disappeared , and that any prospective bridegroom would go off camping , alone , a week before his wedding , certainly provided reporters with ample questions around which to weave a story . <p> The most recent clipping in the file , however , did not mention Carson Chappell . It was dated just this previous week , ten years after Chappell 's disappearance , and had been cut from the San Francisco Chronicle . This was the article that currently interested Detective Dallas Garza as he sat at his desk talking on the phone with Lindsey Wolf , the clipping lying on the desk before him : <p> <p> Remains of hiker found in seaside tree house <p> The skeleton of a man was discovered last evening in a makeshift tree house shelter on the central Oregon coast by a group of Boy Scouts on a weekend camping trip . The victim had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered by sheriff 's deputies . The heavily wooded acreage is on private land and is a new campsite for the Scouts ' yearly outings . The body had been disturbed by small animals and possibly a bobcat , but enough of the bones remain for possible identification . Neither the Oregon Bureau of Investigation , Oregon sheriffs ' departments , nor Oregon police have outstanding missing reports of hikers in that area . " All past missing cases have been resolved , " said OBI agent Henley Mills when interviewed at the scene . <p> <p> This three-pronged congruence of players and events  --  the sudden availability of someone to work the department 's cold files , the discovery of this body though it was not likely related , and the phone call from Lindsey Wolf  --  held Garza 's interest . He sat staring at the article as he spoke with Lindsey ; she had faxed it to him just a few moments earlier , and then had followed up with the call . <p> He knew Lindsey casually , she had dated his brother-in-law several years back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine years ago . Now , Dallas wondered if he 'd been smart to include her file among the cold cases he 'd given Mike to work , wondered if it was wise to stir up that old and painful relationship . <p> But Mike had seemed okay with it , as if he was completely over Lindsey  --  and Dallas wondered , for a moment , amused at himself , if he hesitated to put Mike on the case because of his own sudden surge of interest . Lindsey Wolf was the kind of woman who too easily stirred a man 's blood , a tall , lovely , creamy-skinned woman in her forties , quiet and self-assured . <p> He 'd already seen the article she 'd sent him , he had read it over breakfast a couple of hours before her fax arrived . Now , when he 'd asked Lindsey on the phone if she had information on the Oregon body , she 'd said , " Not information , no . But I have questions , Detective Garza . Are you familiar with the disappearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know the case . I was n't with the department then , but I 've read the cold file . " <p> " I 'm on my way up to the city on business  --  I 'm an accountant , as you may remember . I worked for Carson until just before he . . . Before our planned wedding . We 're into tax season now , and I ca n't put that off . I 'd like to call you as soon as I return , make an appointment to come in . I have no information on the dead man in Oregon . But I think . . . I have such a strong feeling that that body in Oregon could be Carson . I ca n't get past that idea . I know that seems far-fetched and unlikely , when he was supposed to be up on the state park land , here . That 's what he told me , but . . . " She paused , her voice breaking . Then , " I need to talk with you about it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when you get back , " Dallas said . " You can try me on the weekend if you like , but I may be hard to reach . " <p> " Your niece is getting married this weekend ? " <p> " She is , " Dallas said , knowing there had been no announcement in the paper . " I guess you 've talked with Ryan ? " Ryan and Clyde , wanting a low-key wedding without a lot of village interest , had given no notice to the local paper ; they meant to send in a brief mention when they returned from their honeymoon . <p> " It 's a small village , " Lindsey said easily . " I think I heard the news at Jolly 's Deli . Is n't he doing the catering ? " <p> " I believe he is , " Dallas said . " Call me when you get back , I 'd like to hear your thoughts on the Oregon case . " <p> Hanging up , he sat quietly , his square face and dark eyes solemn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't show for the wedding . Angry . Cheated . Mad enough to . . . What ? Then his thoughts turned to his niece 's wedding , and he smiled . That would be a far different matter ; there was no chance that Ryan or Clyde would back out . <p> <br> Continues ...
