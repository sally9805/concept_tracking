" Come to me ! " <P> On a quiet Sunday morning in Silicon Valley , I am standing atop a machine code-named Ginger  --  a machine that may be the most eagerly awaited and wildly , if inadvertently , hyped high-tech product since the Apple Macintosh . Fifty feet away , Ginger 's diminutive inventor , Dean Kamen , is offering instruction on how to use it , which in this case means waving his hands and barking out orders . <P> " Just lean forward , " Kamen commands , so I do , and instantly I start rolling across the concrete right at him . <P> " Now , stop , " Kamen says . How ? This thing has no brakes . " Just think about stopping . " Staring into the middle distance , I conjure an image of a red stop sign  --  and just like that , Ginger and I come to a halt . <P> " Now think about backing up . " Once again , I follow instructions , and soon I glide in reverse to where I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place , and no matter which way I lean or how hard , Ginger refuses to let me fall over . What 's going on here is all perfectly explicable  --  the machine is sensing and reacting to subtle shifts in my balance  --  but for the moment I am slack-jawed , baffled . It was Arthur C. Clarke who famously observed that " any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic . " By that standard , Ginger is advanced indeed . <P> Since last January it has also been the tech world 's most-speculated-about secret . That was when a book proposal about Ginger , a.k.a . " IT , " got leaked to the website
