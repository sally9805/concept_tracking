Softly the snow falls . In the blue morning light a train winds through the hills . The engine pulls a passenger car , brightly lit . Then a dozen blind coal cars , rumbling dark . Six mornings a week the train runs westward from Altoona to Pittsburgh , a distance of a hundred miles . The route is indirect , tortuous ; the earth is buckled , swollen with what lies beneath . Here and there , the lights of a town : rows of company houses , narrow and square ; a main street of commercial buildings , quickly and cheaply built . Brakes screech ; the train huffs to a stop . Cars are added . In the passenger compartment , a soldier on furlough clasps his duffel bag , shivers and waits . The whistle blows . Wheezing , the engine leaves the station , slowed by the extra tons of coal . The train crosses an iron bridge , the black water of the Susquehanna . Lights cluster in the next valley . The town , Bakerton , is already awake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with sound . The valley is deep and sharply featured . Church steeples and mine tipples grow inside it like crystals . At bottom is the town 's most famous landmark , known locally as the Towers , two looming piles of mine waste . They are forty feet high and growing , graceful slopes of loose coal and sulfurous dirt . The Towers give off an odor like struck matches . On windy days they glow soft orange , like the embers of a campfire . Scrap coal , spontaneously combusting ; a million bits of coal bursting into flame . Bakerton is Saxon County 's boomtown . Like the Towers , it is alive with coal . A life that started in the 1880s , when two English brothers , Chester and Elias Baker , broke ground on Baker One . Attracted by handbills , immigrants came : English and Irish , then Italians and Hungarians ; then Poles and Slovaks and Ukrainians and Croats , the " Slavish , " as they were collectively known . With each new wave the town shifted to make room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses appeared at the edge of town . The work-mine work-was backbreaking , dangerous and bleak ; but at Baker Brothers the union was tolerated . By the standards of the time the pay was generous , the housing affordable and clean . The mines were not named for Bakerton ; Bakerton was named for the mines . This is an important distinction . It explains the order of things . Chester Baker was the town 's first mayor . During his term Bakerton acquired the first streetcar line in the county , the first public water supply . Its electric street lamps were purchased from Baker 's own pocket . Figure the cost of maintaining them for fifty years , he wrote to the town bosses , and I will pay you the sum in advance . After twenty years Baker ceded his office , but the bosses continued to meet at his house , a rambling yellow-brick mansion on Indian Hill . A hospital was built , the construction crew paid from a fund Baker had established . He would n't let the building be named for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hospital was constructed in brick ; so were the stores , the dress factory , the churches , the grammar school . After the Commercial Hotel burned to the ground in 1909 , an ordinance was passed , urging merchants to " make every effort to fabricate their establishments of brick . " To a traveler arriving on the morning train-by now an expert on Pennsylvania coal towns-the hat shop and dry-goods store , the pharmacy and mercantile , seem built to last . Their brick facades suggest order , prosperity , permanence . ON THE SEVENTEENTH of January 1944 , a motorcar idled at the railroad crossing , waiting for the train to pass . In the passenger seat was an elderly undertaker of Sicilian descent , named Antonio Bernardi . At the wheel was his great-nephew Gennaro , a handsome , curly-haired youth known in the pool halls as Jerry . Between them sat a blond-haired boy of eight . The car , a black Packard , had been waxed that morning . The old man peered anxiously through the windshield , at the snowflakes melting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if only a Pole would drop dead in the middle of winter and expect to be buried in a snowstorm . The train passed , whistle blowing . The Packard crossed the tracks and climbed a steep road lined with company houses , a part of town known as Polish Hill . The road was loose and rocky ; the coarse stones , called red dog , came from bony piles on the outskirts of town . Black smoke rose from the chimneys ; in the backyards were outhouses , coal heaps , clotheslines stretched between posts . Here and there , miners ' overalls hung out to dry , frozen stiff in the January wind . " These Slavish , " Bernardi said again . " They live like animali . " At one time , his own brothers had lived in company houses , but the family had improved itself . His nephews owned property , houses filled with modern comforts : telephones and flush toilets , gas stoves and carpeted floors . " Papa , " said Jerry , glancing at the boy ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window wide-eyed , having never ridden in a car before . His name was Sandy Novak ; he 'd come knocking at Bernardi 's back door an hour before-breathless , his nose dripping . His mother had sent him running all the way from Polish Hill , to tell Bernardi to come and get his father . The car climbed the slope , engine racing . Briefly the tires slid on the ice . At the top of the hill Jerry braked . " Well ? " said the old man to the boy . " Where do you live ? " " Back there , " said Sandy Novak . " We passed it . " Bernardi exhaled loudly . " Cristo . Now we got to turn around . " Jerry turned the car in the middle of the road . " Pay attention this time , " Bernardi told the boy . " We do n't got all day . " In fact he 'd buried nobody that week , but he believed in staying available . Past opportunities-fires , rockfalls , the number five collapse-had arisen without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only Bernardi could deliver him to God . The Bernardis handled funerals at the five Catholic churches in town . A man named Hiram Stoner had a similar arrangement with the Protestants . When Bernardi 's black Packard was spotted , the town knew a Catholic had died ; Stoner 's Ford meant a dead Episcopalian , Lutheran or Methodist . For years Bernardi had transported his customers in a wagon pulled by two horses . During the flu of ' 18 he 'd moved three bodies at a time . Recently , conceding to modernity , he 'd bought the Packard ; now , when a Catholic died , a Bernardi nephew would be called upon to drive . Jerry was the last remaining ; the others had been sent to England and northern Africa . The old man worried that Jerry , too , would be drafted . Then he 'd have no one left to drive the hearse . " There it is , " the boy said , pointing . " That 's my house . " Jerry slowed . The house was mean and narrow like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , painted green and white . One window , draped with lace curtains , held a porcelain statue of the Madonna . In the other window hung a single blue star . " Who 's the soldier ? " said Jerry . " My brother Georgie , " said Sandy , then added what his father always said . " He 's in the South Pacific . " They climbed the porch stairs , stamping snow from their shoes . A woman opened the door . Her dark hair was loose , her mouth full . A baby slept against her shoulder . She was beautiful , but not young-at least forty , if Bernardi had to guess . He was like a timberman who could guess the age of a tree before counting the rings inside . He had rarely been wrong . She let them inside . Her eyelids were puffy , her eyes rimmed with red . She inhaled sharply , a moist , slurry sound . Bernardi offered his hand . He 'd expected the usual Slavish type : pale and round-faced , a long braid wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This one was dark-eyed , olive-skinned . He glanced down at her bare feet . Italian , he realized with a shock . His mother and sisters had never worn shoes in the house . " My dear lady , " he said . " My condolences for your loss . " " Come in . " She had an ample figure , heavy in the bosom and hip . The type Bernardi-an old bachelor , a window-shopper who 'd looked but had never bought-had always liked . She led them through a tidy parlor-polished pine floor , a braided rug at the center . A delicious aroma came from the kitchen . Not the usual Slavish smell , the sour stink of cooked cabbage . " This way , " said the widow . " He 's in the cellar . " They descended a narrow staircase-the widow first , then Jerry and Bernardi . The dank basement smelled of soap , onions and coal . The widow switched on the light , a single bare bulb in the ceiling . A man lay on the cement floor-fair-haired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain around his neck : Saint Anne , protectress of miners . His hair was wet , his eyes already closed . " He just come home from the mines , " said the widow , her voice breaking . " He was washing up . I wonder how come he take so long . " Bernardi knelt on the cold floor . The man was tall and broad-shouldered . His shirt was damp ; the color had already left his face . Bernardi touched his throat , feeling for a pulse . " It 's no point , " said the woman . " The priest already come . " Bernardi grasped the man 's legs , leaving Jerry the heavier top half . Together they hefted the body up the stairs . Bernardi was sixty-four that spring , but his work had kept him strong . He guessed the man weighed two hundred pounds , heavy even for a Slavish . They carried the body out the front door and laid it in the rear of the car . The boy watched from the porch . A moment later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put on shoes . She handed Bernardi a dark suit on a hanger . " He wore it when we got married , " she said . " I hope it still fits . " Bernardi took the suit . " We 'll bring him back tonight . How about you get a couple neighbors to help us ? He 'll be heavier with the casket . " The widow nodded . In her arms the baby stirred . Bernardi smiled stiffly . He found infants tedious ; he preferred them silent and unconscious , like this one . " A little angel , " he said . " What 's her name ? " " Lucy . " The widow stared over his shoulder at the car . " Dio mio . I ca n't believe it . " " Iddio la benedica . " They stood there a moment , their heads bowed . Gently Bernardi patted her shoulder . He was an old man ; by his own count he 'd buried more than a thousand bodies ; he had glimpsed the darkest truths , the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing he had never witnessed , an Italian wife on Polish Hill .
