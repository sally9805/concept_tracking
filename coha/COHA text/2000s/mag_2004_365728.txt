One has encouraged the world 's poor women to plant 30 million trees . The other creates incendiary fables of female sexuality and subjugation . They make an odd couple , but last week they were united as Nobel laureates : Kenya 's Wangari Maathai for the Peace Prize and Austria 's Elfriede Jelinek for Literature . It was the second year in which women won both of the most notable Nobels . <P> Maathai , 64 , founder of the Green Belt Movement , says the Nobel committee " is going beyond war and looking at what humanity can do to prevent war : managing our natural resources . " She has inspired devotion but also controversy , suggesting that AIDS is a biological weapon that the West planted in Africa to wipe out the black race . <P> Jelinek , 57 , swims in controversy . Her novels ( Women as Lovers ) and film scripts ( Malina ) are searingly personal and political . She writes plays scourging Austria 's far-right Freedom Party and the U.S. invasion of Iraq . Jelinek was little-known abroad until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Piano Teacher jumped a million slots on Amazon.com into the top 10 . That 's one Jelinek story with a happy ending .  --  By Richard Corliss
