Conventional wisdom would tell you Beverly 's Pet Center in Pembroke Pines , Fla. , should have a going out of business sign in its window . A family-owned shop that has sold animals and supplies since 1974 , it 's surrounded by hulking outlets of PetsMart , Pet Supermarket and Pet Supplies Plus . Facing the cut-rate prices of these giant chains , Beverly 's was expected to get gobbled up faster than a mouse in a snake pit . But as in the wild kingdom , life in the retail jungle is full of surprises . <P> Beverly 's turned out to be about as digestible as a porcupine . Kids love it and pester their parents to take them there . Sure , the dog food costs a little more , but they get to play with plenty of puppies , stare at exotic reptiles and marmosets , eat free popcorn , cheer hamster races and get good and scared by the predators in Beverly 's 4,000-gal. shark pond . " We run a clean shop and train our employees to know what they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Beverly 's big rivals , PetsMart , abandoned a location across the street from the shop and relocated several miles away . Beverly 's moved into PetsMart 's old superstore last year , doubling its square footage , and reports that its sales are rising 10% annually . Says Kim Paoletti , who shops there a few times a week with her two young daughters : " It 's more expensive than at the chains , but the pet-food quality is better . " <P> Beverly 's success is part of a feisty comeback by independent shopkeepers , and not just in the pet business . Mom-and-pop retailers in several industries  --  books , coffee and hardware  --  are prospering , sometimes literally in the shadow of popular national chains like Barnes &; Noble , Starbucks and Home Depot . This was n't the case for much of the 1990s , when lower prices and broader selection enabled the giants to crush local shops . And to be sure , in the mass-merchandising field , Wal-Mart continues to stomp most rivals , whatever their size . But big specialty retailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fending off Wal-Mart  --  than on targeting stores such as Beverly 's , whose $3 million in annual sales is mere kibble to them . <P> These trends have left a smaller number of strong indies to fight for some juicy scraps . Independent bookshops have battled successfully to hold a steady 15% share of the market since 1999 , says the American Booksellers Association . And despite the Starbucks blitz , the number of independent java joints has increased from 8,200 in 1999 to about 8,800 today , according to the market research firm Mintel . <P> Why the comeback ? In part , it 's survival of the fittest . Aggressive competition from the chains killed thousands of shaky retailers . Some were financially strapped and could n't afford higher rents . Others tried to match the discounters ' prices and perished . In hardware , many old-timers were not willing to invest in merchandising or such new technologies as inventory-management systems and instead let their businesses decline until they retired .                  @ @ @
