Turning off the tap on leaks , runoff and wasted water . PHOTOGRAPH BY TOM SCHIERLITZ WHEN THEY MOVED FROM WASHINGTON , D.C. , to the Nevada desert 13 years ago , William and Monika Clauberg met an unexpected sight . Water ran down the streets of their Las Vegas subdivision , a testament to the superhuman irrigation efforts required to maintain lush green lawns in a climate where grass can gobble the equivalent of 10 ft. of rainfall a year , while receiving less than 4 in. from the sky . " We could see that water usage was being abused , " Monika says . Determined to take control of their own consumption , the couple installed efficient showers and toilets , but the grass in their yard  --  and in those of their neighbors  --  continued to gulp a vast volume of water . Photograph : DIAGRAMS BY GOLDEN SECTION GRAPHICS A lot has changed since then . Las Vegas residents whose irrigation runs into the street can now expect to be collared by a roving water waste investigator and fined up to $640 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's now enduring its seventh year of drought . Yet , even Americans in places blessed with strong umbrella sales are realizing that reducing their " water footprint "  --  indoor water use , outdoor water use and storm runoff  --  is crucial . " If you do n't have a water quantity problem , you have a water quality problem , " says Art Ludwig , an ecological water systems designer in California . That 's because runoff from poorly planned properties causes sewers to overflow , dumping an estimated 850 billion gal . of storm water mixed with untreated sewage into waterways each year . There 's an energy cost , too : The California Energy Commission found that 19 percent of the state 's total electricity and 32 percent of its natural gas was used to pump , treat , heat and dispose of water . WHERE YOU STAND Ironically , the most water gets used in the regions that can least afford it . In the arid Southwest , it 's common for homeowners to dump more than 400 gal . a day on their lawns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slowly catching up . Sales of koi ponds and fountains quadrupled from 1998 to 2003 , when 16 million were installed . These garden products typically use from 500 to 4000 gal . of water each hour ; even if they recirculate the water , much is lost to evaporation and periodic cleaning . In another unfortunate trend , unmetered residential wells are being installed in many subdivisions to irrigate vast swaths of lawn . More than 6500 of these wells were installed in Massachusetts between 2000 and 2005 ; not coincidentally , nearly 70 percent of the state 's river basins  --  the area of land drained by a river and its tributaries  --  are now classified as flow-stressed . However , advances over the past 15 years prove that the country can make changes for the better . Indoor water use grew steadily through the 20th century as homes got modern plumbing and appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines . But that stopped in 1992 , with the first federal standards for water-efficient plumbing fixtures . A decrease in indoor water use continues today as older homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern appliances  --  which in many cases are thriftier as well as more convenient  --  can cut indoor water usage in half . WHAT YOU CAN DO If the price of water was anything like the price of gasoline , nobody would leave the tap running while they brush their teeth . Water-saving efforts do n't have the same financial jolt that energy conservation has , but the issue is no less urgent , says Sadhu Johnston , the commissioner for Chicago 's Department of Environment . Johnston 's office faces Lake Michigan . " You look out the window and see the Great Lakes , and there seems to be unlimited water , " he says . " But there 's more to it than that . " Pollution of the lake through storm runoff is a major concern for Chicago , which is why this year alone the city is distributing 5000 rain barrels made from recycled materials , to divert water from storm sewers to backyards . On a smaller scale , clients of Milwaukee-based landscape architect Rosheen Styczinski are keeping her busy designing rain gardens , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such creative outdoor solutions are at the frontier of water conservation . Amy Vickers , a water consultant who wrote the efficient-plumbing standards for the Energy Policy Act of 1992 , points out that even miserly , high-tech irrigation of a thirsty lawn creates prob-lems in dry regions . " I 'm a big believer in water-efficiency technology , " she says , " but we have to be aware of its limits . We need water conservation , not just water efficiency . " Monika Clauberg found an inspired alternative for her Las Vegas yard during hikes through Death Valley and Red Rock Canyon , where she saw beautiful plants such as chaparral sage and desert marigold that were adapted to dry climates . Back home , she tore out the lawn , planted some trees and started scattering seeds . Was it a sacrifice ? Not really . The result was a 50 percent cut in water bills  --  and a lush , grass-free and award-winning desert landscape . BREAKING IT DOWN 363 gallons IS ROUGHLY HOW MUCH WATER A TYPICAL U.S. HOUSEHOLD USES DAILY . HERE 'S WHERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawns and gardens far outweighs other uses . While this can be true even in rainy Seattle , the numbers are particularly striking in the driest regions : In Scottsdale , Ariz. , two-thirds of a home 's water usage goes to outdoor plants . Another factor that varies widely by region , along with local development patterns and topography , is runoff  --  rain and irrigation water that sweeps from paved driveways , patios and streets into municipal sewer systems . It gets less attention than consumption , but its impact is felt far beyond the home . Uncontrolled runoff can overwhelm treatment facilities , carry lawn chemicals into lakes and rivers and contribute to downstream flooding . Inside the home , the biggest factor in consumption is family size , but dramatic differences also flow from technology . In a study conducted in Tampa , Fla. , new fixtures and appliances slashed a third of the water used in showers and faucets , while the water consumed by washing machines and toilets was cut in half . Overall , daily water use indoors dropped from 77.2 gal . per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . 66,175 gallons per household per year 70 gallons per person , per day 440 gallons per hour 1 . INDOOR USE WHEN LOW-FLUSH TOILETS were first federally mandated in 1992 , the results were mixed . " People had a certain number of unpleasant experiences with them , " acknowledges Doug Bennett , the Southern Nevada Water Authority 's conservation manager . These days , rigorous testing ensures that 1.6-gal. toilets outperform the 5- to 7-gal. models of the 1980s . Dishwashers , shower heads and faucets have been similarly improved , and front-loading washing machines use less than 40 percent as much hot water as older models . And engineers are n't finished making improvements to everyday technology . A new style of " flapperless " toilet , for instance , eliminates the flexible seal between tank and bowl that gradually deteriorates and is responsible for most toilet leaks . In a recent Florida study , leaks were reduced by 80 percent where the toilets were installed . WATER , RECLAIMED Many commercial buildings use " gray water " from sinks to perform functions such as flushing toilets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , directing water from a washing machine into mulch basins ( not sprinklers ) to irrigate trees and shrubs . Homeowners should check plumbing codes , and avoid using detergents with boron , sodium and chlorine . Yet " it 's fairly idiotproof , " says Art Ludwig , who provides guidance at the Web site of his company , Oasis Design . Photograph : PHOTOGRAPH BY JEFFREY BRAVERMAN ( DE LA PIEDRA ) WEEKEND PROJECT STOP A PLUMBING PROBLEM The cheapest , most effective way for many people to save water could be the fastest DIY fix around : Replace a toilet 's leaking tank ball or flapper . A silently running toilet can waste 75 gal . of water per day . If you hear it running , a leak may be costing 300 gal . Got 10 minutes ? Go forth and conserve . Diagnose the problem Remove the tank lid , flush and watch the ball or flapper ( shown here ) drop onto the valve to cut off water flow to the bowl . If the ball lands off-center , a simple adjustment to the lift-wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has deteriorated , the part should be replaced with a new flapper . Remove old hardware Shut off the water ( or you 'll really have a running toilet ) and remove the old flapper or ball with its lift wire . Install the tank flapper Slide the mounting collar down the overflow tube ( the wider vertical pipe in the photo above ) . Then attach the flapper to the collar , and hook up the flapper 's chain to the flush lever . Turn the water back on  --  and enjoy the sound of silence . The Guardian of Small Leaks Fifteen years ago , water was not on most people 's radar , says Jerry de la Piedra . However , the senior conservation specialist for California 's Santa Clara Water District has seen attitudes change . " Water is getting up there " as a concern for people , de la Piedra says . " They 're realizing its limits . " In his own home , de la Piedra has switched to low-flow fixtures . But fixing leaks makes the biggest impact , he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , mark the water meter reading . Wait 1 hour , making sure that no one uses any water . Then check the meter again . If it has moved , you 've got a weekend project to do . TIPS Dye Trick Uncover a silent toilet leak by putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank  --  if any color shows up in the bowl , you 've got trouble . ( See instructions at left for fixing it . ) Drip Relief A faucet dripping once per second does more than shred REM sleep : It wastes up to 3000 gal . a year . Most leaks can be fixed by replacing a washer . A cartridge faucet is slightly more complex  --  bring along the old cartridge when buying a new one . Faucet Update Check the flow rate of faucets with flow bags , which are available in " water audit " kits provided by many water utilities . It should be less than 2.2 gal . per minute ( gpm ) in the kitchen and 1.5 gpm in the bathroom . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new WaterSense label . Air Heads To get a more forceful shower from a low-flow head , try this $55 Oxygenics model , which pressurizes the incoming water with air . Federal rules stipulate a flow of no more than 2.5 gpm ; this achieves it without sacrificing comfort . Portion Control Run only full loads in washing machines and dishwashers  --  and do n't pre-rinse dishes if you have a newer machine . The Xeriscape Artist " In Phoenix , temperature and climate do n't work like they do elsewhere , " says Vynnie McDaniels , who has lived in the desert city since 1993 . " We get about 22 in. of rain a year  --  and the joke is that it all comes in one day . " Instead of relying on heavy watering to maintain plants imported from wetter climates , McDaniels provides homeowners with garden consultation , promoting Xeriscaping  --  choosing plants that naturally thrive in the desert  --  and making smart use of the water that is available . During the city 's intense , brief rains , McDaniels captures rainwater from roofs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I focus on solutions , " he says . " It 's not just cactus and gravel . " Photograph : PHOTOGRAPH BY LARSEN &; TALBERT ( MCDANIELS ) 2 . OUTDOOR USE HOMEOWNERS IN LAS VEGAS have been busy tearing out their lawns , thanks to a $2 per-sq. - ft. incentive program . So far , 80 million sq . ft. of grass has been removed , with each foot saving up to 73 gal . of water annually . And local water authorities fly over a 475-sq. - mile area each year , snapping photos to map every remaining scrap of turf . Why all the fuss ? Because lawns and gardens are a home 's biggest water users  --  and that 's true not just in Nevada , but nationwide . " Low-flow shower heads and toilets get more attention , " says Ronnie Cohen , a Natural Resources Defense Council analyst in San Francisco , " but there are huge savings if people look carefully at what they 're planting , and have a properly designed and installed irrigation system . " WHAT GRASS TO PLANT Classic Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of water and chemicals to keep it healthy in drier , hotter parts of the country . For those in arid regions who are ready to forgo a lawn , there are myriad flowering plants , ground-cover standbys , shrubs and tall prairie grasses such as switchgrass and big bluestem ready to take center stage . For people who do want a more conventional lawn , here are some water-thrifty alternatives . * VARIABLE CLIMATES : Western fescue ( Festuca occidentalis ) , crested wheat grass ( Agropyron cristatum ) .

A New Swim Cap A properly fitting cover can slow evaporation from your swimming pool , reducing water use by nearly 30 percent . Drip . Drip . Drip . For trees and flowerbeds , consider applying low-volume drip irrigation directly to the roots , which reduces waste , runoff and evaporation . The parts can cost less than $30 . Also , water first thing in the morning ( ideally before sunrise ) to minimize evaporation . 3 . RUNOFF WITH SPREADING WATER SHORTAGES , you 'd think a good heavy rain would be , well , heaven-sent . But there are now 25 million acres of impervious surfaces nationally  --  equivalent to a parking lot the size of Virginia  --  where rainfall runs off rather than soaking in . The rushing streamlets carry fertilizers , pesticides , eroded soil and organic material into storm sewers , and from there into waterways . Many cities ( 746 of them across the country ) have old sewer systems that can overflow in heavy storms , contributing to local drinking water problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf of Mexico . But there 's also a boom in techniques to catch storm water or allow it to soak harmlessly into the ground . Cities are starting to subsidize the cost of rain barrels for residents , while sales of paving stones that let water seep through gaps nearly doubled in 2005 , to 17.8 million sq . ft . BETTER THAN PAVEMENT These driveway and patio surfaces can all help reduce runoff  --  while looking good . Clockwise from top : 1 .

( The material is used at the Pentagon for helipads . ) WEEKEND PROJECT PLANT A RAIN GARDEN One way to prevent runoff is to divert water from your gutters to a rain garden  --  a 6-in. - deep depression filled with water-loving plants . A properly designed garden will absorb standing water within hours , so it wo n't turn into a mosquito breeding ground . Site it : Plant the garden on a gentle slope ( less than 12 degrees ) at least 10 ft. from the house . To test the soil , dig a 6-in. hole and fill it with water . If there 's still standing water after 24 hours , the soil is n't permeable enough . Dig it : The garden should be about 15 percent as big as the area it drains for sandy soil , more for silt or clay soil . When digging , tie a string between two stakes and use a carpenter 's level to make sure the bottom of the garden is flat . Use the soil you excavate to build a gentle berm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : The right mix of plants depends on where you live . Sedges and ferns are popular choices ; gardeners can add a mix of perennials and shrubs . Some trees , including red maple and river birch , are suitable . Add 2 in. of mulch after planting . TIPS Rain Barrel Containers to collect rainwater date back 2000 years  --  and are just as useful today . Directing your downspout to a rain barrel will not only reduce runoff , but also provide water for your lawn and garden . Beyond Shingles Green roofs , incorporating vegetation , have begun to appear on single-family homes . Even those with sloped surfaces absorb about 45 percent of the rainfall in a 2-in. storm , and delay runoff of the rest for 45 minutes . Acid Test Determine the pH levels of your soil with a kit from your garden center . Once you figure out which nutrients your soil actually needs , you can stop applying unneeded chemicals that wash away . <p>                 @ @ @ @
