Nathalie Feix grew up in Switzerland , spent her undergraduate years at the University of Geneva and earned a master 's degree in public policy from the London School of Economics . When she decided to study law , though , she skipped Europe 's elite institutions and enrolled at the University of Miami . Why ? Feix , 26 , who worked for Hewlett-Packard in Geneva last summer , explains that U.S. law schools have " law reviews , moot court , judicial clerkships , litigation training  --  things that are n't available in Europe . " <P> And she has another reason : U.S. law is becoming the lingua franca of international business . Last year 1,400 foreign nationals enrolled in standard three-year programs at U.S. law schools . An additional 2,800 enrolled in master of laws programs  --  a 62% increase since 1996 . Most of these master 's students have earned law degrees in other countries and find the programs attractive because they can usually be completed in one year . <P> How is it that a field as culturally idiosyncratic as law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a simple answer . The knowledge these students gain of American-style contracts , corporate accounting and securities law makes them valuable for negotiating international deals  --  either for companies or law firms in their homelands or for U.S. multinationals . With American firms representing clients who hold the purse strings in much of global commerce , they often get to draft the legal language that governs cross-border deals . That has made New York State law , in particular , a global gold standard , often invoked in a transaction even when neither party is based in the U.S. " It 's become a neutral , third-party law , " says Jeff Lewis , a partner at the New York City firm Cleary , Gottlieb . " In Asia and Latin America , when a state enterprise auctions off assets , the legal documents are often written to be governed by New York law . It 's done to attract American investment . " <P> With European economies becoming more competitive , U.S.-trained lawyers are also in high demand there . " American laws and business structures  --  from antitrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive product markets , " says Harvard law professor Mark Roe . His Harvard colleague William Alford says U.S. law schools excel at " teaching problem solving , " which makes their graduates broadly useful within corporations . <P> Foreign graduates of U.S. law schools are especially prized by recruiters because they 're often multilingual and bring special knowledge of their countries and regions . Says Lewis : " They 're the glue that helps us stay together as a global firm . "
