The first thing she finds is a hand . In the beginning , she thinks it 's a tangle of sheet or a wadded sock caught between the mattress cover and the mattress , a bump the size of a walnut but softer , more yielding . She feels it as she 's lying , lazing , in bed . Often , lately , her body keeps her beached , though today the sun beckons , the dogwoods blooming white , the peonies ' glossy buds specked black with ants . Tom has gone to work already , backing out of the driveway in his pickup truck . She has taken her temperature on the pink thermometer , noted it down on the graph  --  98.2 , day eighteen , their thirteenth month of trying . She takes it again , to be sure , then settles back in , drifting , though she knows she should get up . The carpenters will be here soon ; the air will ring with hammers . The men will find more expensive , unnerving problems with the house . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so small and steady , like one of the pests they keep uncovering in this ancient , tilting farmhouse  --  powder post beetles , termites , carpenter ants . <p> She feels the bump in the bed the way she might encounter a new mole on her skin , or a scab that had somehow gone unnoticed , her hand traveling vaguely along her body until it stumbles , oh , what 's this ? With her shin , she feels it first , as she turns over , beginning to get up . She sends an arm under the covers , palpitates the bump . A pair of bunched panties , maybe , shed during sex and caught beneath the new sheet when she remade the bed ? Tom 's sock ? A wad of tissue ? Some unknown object ( needle threader , sock darner , butter maker , chaff-separator ? ) left here by the generations of people who came before ? The carpenters keep finding things in the walls and under the floor : the sole of an old shoe , a rusted nail , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green of key lime pie . Each time they announce another rotted sill , cracked joist , additional repair , they hand an object over , her consolation prize . The house looked so charming from the outside , so fine and perfectly itself . The inspector said go ahead , buy it . But you never know what 's lurking underneath . <p> She gets out of the bed , stretches , yawns . Her gaze drops to her naked body , so familiar , the thin freckled limbs and flattish stomach . She has known it forever , lived with it forever . Mostly it has served her well , but lately it seems a foreign , uncooperative thing , at once insolent and lethargic , a taunt . Sometimes , though , she still finds in herself an energy that surprises her , reminding her of when she was a child and used to run  --  legs churning , pulse throbbing  --  down the long river path that led to her cousin 's house . <p> Now , in a motion so concentrated it 's fierce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pad . What she sees does n't surprise her ; she 's been waiting so hard , these days , looking so hard . A hand , it is , a small , pink dimpled fist , the skin slightly mottled , the nails the smallest slivers , cut them or they 'll scratch . Five fingers . Five nails . She picks it up ; it flexes slightly , then curls back into a warm fist . Five fine fingers , none missing . She counts them again to be sure . You have to begin somewhere , the books say . You have to relinquish control and let nature take its course . <p> She hears the door open downstairs , the clomp of workboots , words , a barking laugh . Looking around , she spots , on the bedroom floor , the burlap sack that held the dwarf liberty apple tree Tom planted over the weekend . She drops the hand into the bag , stuffs the bag under the bed . Still the air smells like burlap , thick and dusty . She pulls on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more flattering pair of jeans , and a T-shirt that shows off her breasts . She read somewhere that men are drawn to women with small waists and flaring hips . Evolution , the article said . A body built for birth . Her own hips are small and boyish ; her waist does not cinch in . Her pubic hair grows thin and blond , grass in a drought . She does n't want these workmen , exactly , but she would like them , for the briefest moment , to want her . As she goes barefoot down the stairs to make a cup of tea and smile at the men , she stops for a moment , struck by a memory of the perfect little hand ; even the thought of it makes her gasp . The men wo n't find it . They 're only working in the basement and the attic , structural repairs to keep the house from falling down . <p> In her kitchen , the three men : Rick and Tony and Joaquin . Their eyes flicker over her . She touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks down . More bad news , I 'm afraid , Rick tells her . We found it yesterday , after you left  --  a whole section of the attic . What , she asks . Charred , he says dramatically . There must have been a fire ; some major support beams are only three-quarter their original size . She shakes her head . Really ? But the inspector never  --  I have my doubts , Rick says , about this so-called inspector of yours . Can you fix it , she asks . He looks at her glumly through heavy-lidded eyes . We can try , he answers . I 'll draw up an estimate but we 'll need to finish the basement before we get to this . Yes , she says vaguely , already bored . Fine , thanks . <p> Had she received such news the day before , it would have made her dizzy . A charred , unstable attic , a house whittled down by flames . She would have called Tom at work  --  You 're not going to believe this  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , and thought about suing the inspector and installing more smoke alarms , one in every room , blinking eyes . Today , though , she ca n't quite concentrate ; her thoughts keep returning , as if of their own accord , to what she discovered in her bed . One apricot-sized hand , after thirteen months , after peeing into cups , tracking her temperature , making Tom lie still as a statue after he comes , no saliva , no new positions , her rump tilted high into the air afterwards , an absurd position but she does n't care . <p> After thirteen months of watching for the LH surge on the ovulation predictor kit  --  the deep indigo line of a good egg , the watery turquoise of a bad , and inside her own body , waves cresting and breaking , for she has become an ocean , or it is an oceanographer ? Study us hard enough , the waves call out to her , watch us closely enough and we shall do your will . She has noted the discharge on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like she 's a chef making meringues or a chicken trying to lay . Get to know your body , chant the books , the Web sites , her baby  --  bearing friends , and oh she has , she does , though it 's beginning to feel like a cheap car she has leased for a while and is getting ready to return . <p> She still likes making love with Tom , the tremble of it , the slow , blue wash , the way they lie cupped together in their new , old house as it sits in the greening fields , on the turning earth . It 's afterwards that she hates . She can never fall asleep without picturing the spastic , thrashing tails , the egg 's hard shell , the long , thin tubes stretched like IVs toward a pulsing womb . A speck , she imagines sometimes , the head of a pin , the dot of a period . The End  --  or maybe , if they 're lucky , dot dot dot . <p> But the hand is so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands shake with relief as she puts on the tea water . Something is starting  --  a secret , a discovery , begun not in the narrow recesses of her body , but in the mysterious body of her new , old house . The house has a door called the Mourning Door  --  the realtor pointed it out the first time they walked through . It 's a door off the front parlor , and though it leads outside , it has no stoop or stairs , just a place for the cart to back up so the coffin can be carried away . Of course babies were born here , too , added the realtor , her voice too bright . Probably right in this room ! After she and Tom moved in , they decided only to use the door off the kitchen . Friendlier , she said , and after all , they 're concentrating , these days , on making life . <p> When she goes back upstairs , she takes the burlap sack and a flashlight to the warm , musty attic , where Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she finds , in one dark corner , the section where the fire left its mark . She touches the wood , and a smudge of ash comes off on her finger . She tastes it : dry powder , ancient fruit , people passing buckets , lives lost , found , lost . She leaves the sack in the other corner of the attic inside a box marked " Kitchen Stuff . " Then she heads downstairs to wash her hands . <p> Three days later she is doing laundry when she comes across a shoulder , round and smooth . She knows it should be disconcerting to find such a thing separated from its owner , a shoulder disembodied , lying in a nest of dryer lint , tucked close to the wall . But why get upset ? After all , the world is full of parts apart from wholes . A few months ago , she and Tom went to the salvage place  --  old radiator covers , round church windows , faucets and doorknobs , a spiral staircase leading nowhere . Then , they bought two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen through twenty-five . Now she wipes her hands on her jeans and picks the shoulder up . It is late afternoon , the contractors gone , Tom still at work . She brings the shoulder up to the attic and puts it in the sack with the hand . Then she goes to the bedroom , swallows a vitamin the size of a horse pill , climbs into bed , and falls asleep . <p> Whereas before she had been agitated , unable to turn her thoughts away , now she is peaceful , assembling something , proud . But tired , too  --  this is not unexpected ; every day by four or five o'clock she has to sink into bed for a nap , let in dreams full of floaty shapes , closed fists , and open mouths . Still , most days , she gets a little something done . She lines a trunk with old wallpaper , goes for a walk in the woods with a friend , starts to plan a lesson sequence on how leaves change color in the fall . Her children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rivers and seas . Sometimes she gets a " Dear Teacher " postcard : I found some mica . We went on a boat . I lost my ring in the lake . The water in the postcards is always a vivid , chlorinated blue . She gets her hair cut , sees a matinee movie with her friend Hannah , starts to knit again . One night Tom remarks  --  perhaps with relief , perhaps with the slightest tinge of fear  --  that she seems back to her old self . <p> In the basement , the men put in lally columns , thick and red , to keep the first floor from falling in . They construct a vapor barrier , rewire the electricity . They sister the joists and patch the foundation . In her bedroom , she stuffs cotton in her ears to block the noise . She wears sweatpants or loose shorts now , and Tom 's shirts . Each time she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror , she is struck by how pretty she looks , her eyes so bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She finds a second foot with five perfect toes , and a second shoulder . She finds a leg , an arm . No eyes yet , no face . Everything in time , she tells herself , and at the Center for Reproductive Medicine they inject her womb with blue , and she sees her tubes , thin as violin strings , curled and ghostly on the screen . They have her drink water and lie on her back . They swab gel on her belly , and she neglects to tell them that her actual belly is at home , smelling like dust and apple wood , snoozing under the eaves . They say come in on day three , on day ten . They swab her with more gel and give her a rattle , loose pills in an amber jar . Tom goes to the clinic , and they shut him in a room with girlie magazines and take his fish . At home , while he is at the doctor 's , she finds a tiny penis , sweet and curled . Tom comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor and sighs . She says do n't worry , babe , and leans to kiss him on the arm . She would like to tell him about everything she has found , but she knows she must protect her secret . Things are so fragile , really  --  the earth settles , the house shifts . You put up a wall in the wrong place and so never find the hidden object in the eaves . You speak too soon and cause  --  with your hard , your hopeful words  --  a clot , a cramp . Things are so fragile , but then also not . Look at the ants , she tells herself  --  how they always find a place to make a nest . Look at the people of the earth , each one with a mother . At the supermarket , she stares at them  --  their hands , their faces , how neatly it all goes together , a completed puzzle . <p> She knows her own way is out of the ordinary , but then what is ordinary these days ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of petri dishes and turkey basters , of trade and barter , test and track , mix and match . Women carry the eggs of other women , or have their own eggs injected back into them pumped with potential , four or six at a time . Sperm are washed and coddled , separated and sifted , like gold . Ovaries are inflated until they spill with treasures . The names sound like code words : GIFT , IUI , ZIFT . Though it upsets her to admit it , the other women at the Center disgust her a little . They seem so desperate , they look so swollen , but in all the wrong places  --  their eyes , their chins , their hearts . Not me , she thinks as the nurse calls her name and she rises with a friendly smile . <p> One day , she moves the burlap bag from the attic to the back of her bedroom closet . It 's such a big house , and the attic is sweltering now , and soon the men will be working up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in a tiny , rented bungalow and looked into each other 's eyes a lot . She loves Tom ; she really does , though lately he seems quite far away . Outside , here , is a swing set made of old , splintered cedar , not safe enough for use . But that same day , she finds an ear in it , tucked like a chestnut under a climbing pole . The tomatoes are ripe now . The sunflowers she planted in May are taller than she is , balancing their heads on swaying stalks . In the herb garden , the chives bear fat purple balls . The ear , oddly , is downed with dark hair , like the ear of a young primate . She holds it to her own ear as if she might hear something inside it  --  the sea , perhaps , a heartbeat or a yawn . It looks so tender that she wraps it in tissue paper before placing it in the bag . <p> One night on the evening news , she and Tom see a story about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a coma , and now the girl performs miracles and people think she 's a saint . The news shows her lying in Worcester in her parents ' garage , hitched to life support while pilgrims come from near and far : people on crutches , children with cancer , barren women , men dying of AIDS . Jesus , says Tom , shuddering . People will believe anything  --  how sick . But she does n't think it 's so sick , the way the vinyl-sided ranch house is transformed into a wall of flowers , the way people bring gifts  --  Barbie dolls , barrettes , Hawaiian Punch ( the girl 's favorite )  --  and a blind man sees again , and a baby blooms from a tired woman 's torso , and the rest of the people , well , the rest sit briefly in the full lap of hope , then get in their cars and go home . The girl is pretty , even though she 's almost dead . Her braid is black and shiny , her brow peaceful . Her mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . Her father is petitioning the Vatican for the girl to be made an official saint . <p> Days now , while the men work in the attic , she roams . She wanders the house looking for treasures , and on the days when she does not find them , she gets in her car and drives to town , or out along the country roads . Sometimes she finds barn sales and gets things for the house  --  a chair for Tom 's desk , an old egg candler filled with holes . One day at a yard sale , she buys a sewing machine , though she 's never used one . I 'll give you the instruction book , the woman says . It 's easy  --  you 'll see . Also at this yard sale is a playpen , a high chair , a pile of infant clothes . The woman sees her staring at them . I thought you might be expecting , she says , smiling . But I did n't want to presume . As a bonus , she throws in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a blue and white sailor suit . It was my son 's , she says , and from behind the house come  --  as if in proof  --  the shrieks of kids at play . <p> That night , with Tom in New York for an overnight meeting , she sets up the sewing machine and sits with the instruction manual in her lap . She slides out the trap door under the needle , examining the bobbin . Slowly , following the instructions , she winds the bobbin full of beige thread , then threads the needle . She gets the bag from the closet . She 's not sure she 's ready ( the books say you 're never sure ) , but at the same time her body is guiding , pushing , urging her . Breathe , she commands herself , and draws a deep breath . She has never done this before , never threaded the needle or assembled the pattern or put together the parts , but it does n't seem to matter ; she has a sense of how to approach it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a hand out of the bag and tries to stitch it to an arm , but the machine jams so she unwinds a length of thread from the bobbin , pulls a needle from the pincushion , and begins again , by hand . <p> Slowly , awkwardly , she stitches arm to shoulder , stops to catch her breath and wipe the sweat from her brow . She remembers back stitch , cross stitch ; someone ( her mother ? ) must have taught her long ago . She finds the other hand , the other arm . Does she have everything ? It 's been a long summer , and she 's found so much ; she might be losing track . If there are n't enough pieces , do n't panic , she tells herself . He does n't need to be perfect ; she 's not asking for that . He can be missing a part or two , he can need extra care . Her own body , after all , has its flaws , its stubborn limits . What , anyway , is perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given , what she has been able , bit by bit , to make . <p> She stitches feet to legs , carefully doing the seams on the inside so they wo n't show . She attaches leg to torso , sews on the little penis . The boy-child begins to stir , to struggle ; perhaps he has to pee . Not yet , my love . Hold on . She works long and hard and late into the night , her body tight with effort , the room filled with animal noises that spring from her mouth as if she were someone else . She wishes , with a deep , aching pain , that Tom were here to guide her hands , to help her breathe and watch her work . Finally  --  it must be near dawn  --  she reaches into the bag and finds nothing . How tired she is , bone tired , skin tired . She must be finished , for she has used up all the parts . <p> Slowly , then , as if in sleep , she rises with the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and so ca n't quite see him , though she feels his downy head , his foot and hand . He curls toward her for an instant as if to nurse , so she unbuttons her blouse and draws him near . He nuzzles toward her but does not drink , and she passes a hand over his face and realizes that he has no mouth . Carefully , in the dark , she inspects him with both her hands and mind : he has a nose but no mouth , wrists but no elbows . She spreads her palm over his torso , and her fingers tell her that he has kidneys and a liver but only six small ribs and half a heart . Oh , she tells him . Oh , I 'm sorry . I tried so hard . I found and saved and stitched and tried so hard and yet <p> She feels it first , before he goes : a spasm in her belly , a clot in her brain , a sorrow so thick and familiar that she knows she 's felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tangible . Six small ribs and only half a heart . While she holds him , he twitches twice and then is still . <p> Carrying him , she makes her way downstairs . It 's lighter now , the purple-blue of dawn . She walks to the front parlor , past the TV , past the old honey extractor they found in the barn . She walks to the Mourning Door and tries to open it . It does n't budge , wedged shut , and for a moment she panics  --  she has to get out now ; the weight in her arms keeps getting heavier , a sack of stones . She needs to pass it through this door and set it down , or she will break . Trying to stay calm , she goes to the laundry room and finds a screwdriver , returns to the door , and wedges the tool in along the lock placket , balancing the baby on one arm . Finally the door gives , and she walks through it , forgetting that no steps meet it outside . Falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , catches her balance ( somehow , she has n't dropped him ) to stand stunned and breathless in the still morning air , her knees weak from landing hard . <p> Across the road , the sheep in the field have begun their bleating . Atruck drives by , catching her briefly in its headlights . She lowers her nose to the baby 's head and breathes in the smell of him . He 's lighter now , easier now . Depart , she thinks , the word an old prayer following her through the door . Depart in peace . With her hands , she memorizes the slope of his nose , the open architecture of his skull . She fingers the spirals of one ear . Then she turns and starts walking , out behind the house to the barn where a shovel hangs beside the hoe and rake . It 's lighter now . A mosquito hovers close to her face . The day will be hot . Later , Tom will return . She buries the baby under a hawthorn tree on the backstretch of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says as she turns to go . Thank you , she says  --  to him or to the air  --  when she is halfway home . She sleeps all morning and gardens through the afternoon . <p> That night ( day sixteen , except she 's stopped charting ) , she and Tom make love , and afterwards she thinks of nothing  --  no wagging fish , no hovering egg , no pathway , her thoughts as flat and clean as sheets . Tom smells like himself  --  it is a smell she loves and had nearly forgotten  --  and after their sex , they talk about his trip , and he runs a hand idly down her back . She is ready for something now  --  a child inside her or a child outside , come from another bed , another place . Or she is ready , perhaps , for no child at all , a trip with Tom to a different altitude or hemisphere , a rocky , twisting hike . They make love again , and after she comes , she cries , and he asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can describe , it 's where she 's been , so far away and without him  --  in the charred attic , the tipped basement , where red columns try to shore up a house that will stand for as long as it wants to and fall when it wants to fall . Nothing , she says , and inside her something joins , or tries to join , forms or does not , and her dream , when she sleeps , is of the far horizon , a smooth , receding curve . <p> <p> By Elizabeth Graver <p>
