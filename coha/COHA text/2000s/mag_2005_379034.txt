After 16 years coaching football , Ameritrade CEO JOE MOGLIA knows comebacks . Once a dotcom disaster , Ameritrade has revived on his watch . It recently snubbed a bid from E-Trade and instead bought TD Waterhouse U.S.A. , part of Toronto-Dominion Bank . Moglia spoke with TIME 's JYOTI THOTTAM about online trading in the post-bubble era . <P> TIME You 're a popular guy these days . Why all the interest in Ameritrade ? <P> JOE MOGLIA Our performance has been extraordinary . In a difficult environment our market cap has grown by five- or sixfold . We have greater than 50% pretax margins . We 've got a pristine balance sheet . We are 25% of the active-trader market in the U.S. We 're a very , very attractive asset . <P> TIME Why did you choose to merge with TD Waterhouse over E-Trade ? <P> JM Ameritrade is very , very strong in the active-trader space . The area we want to move into is the long-term-investor space , and TD Waterhouse is very strong in that . <P> TIME There were 150 online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How much more consolidation will there be ? <P> JM Significantly more . Five years from now , I think there will be 40 to 50 , and there will be three names that everybody 's familiar with . <P> TIME So what changes will Ameritrade customers see postmerger ? <P> JM Greater customization and choice . If you want a do-it-yourself online experience , you can have that . If you want to have a relationship with a branch , you can have that . <P> TIME Are you expecting layoffs ? <P> JM There will definitely be layoffs . You ca n't achieve that kind of savings an expected $578 million without layoffs . <P> TIME This merger is paying a nice dividend to the Ricketts family . Founder Joe Ricketts and his wife Marlene stand to gain $804 million . I think he should take you out to lunch . <P> JM I agree . <P> TIME Has your industry grown up ? <P> JM I think it has . All of financial services has . Things clearly did get a little bit out of hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like that without learning from it . You go out of business , or you learn . We 're in business for a reason . <P> TIME How long before traditional brokers like Merrill Lynch are obsolete ? <P> JM They 'll never be obsolete as long as they have a focus on the client . They just have different businesses than what we are . The focus on the retail side of Merrill Lynch is truly the wealthy , person-to-person relationship . There 's only so many people you can do that with . That 's where an Ameritrade comes in . While the Merrill Lynches of the world go after the wealthiest of our society , the online brokers go after the mass affluent . There are 37 million households that have between $100,000 and $1 million in assets . Clearly the full-service firms ca n't come close to getting all of those . The online brokerages can . We have about 3.5 million clients . Our typical client has about $125,000 in investable assets , so it 's very much part of that mass affluent market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
