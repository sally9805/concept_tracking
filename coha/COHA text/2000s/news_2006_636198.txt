<p> Awake in the Dark : The Best of Roger Ebert , just published by the University of Chicago Press , achieves a first . Though the Sun-Times film critic remains the dean of American cineastes , his essential writings have never been collected in a single volume until now . Awake in the Dark surveys his 40-year catalog , including reviews , essays and interviews . The following is an excerpt from the book 's introduction , and for the next five weeks we 'll publish excerpts here from the collection 's highlights in each decade , from the ' 60s to the ' 00s . <p> I began my work as a film critic in 1967 . I had not thought to be a film critic , and indeed had few firm career plans apart from vague notions that I might someday be a political columnist or a professor of English . <p> Robert Zonka , who was named the paper 's feature editor the same day I was hired at the Chicago Sun-Times , became one of the best friends of a lifetime . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference room , told me that Eleanor Keen , the paper 's movie critic , was retiring , and that I was the new critic . I walked away in elation and disbelief , yet hardly suspected that this day would set the course for the rest of my life . <p> How long could you be a movie critic , anyway ? I had copies of Pauline Kael 's I Lost It at the Movies , Arthur Knight 's The Liveliest Art , and Andrew Sarris ' Interviews With Film Directors , and I read them cover to cover and plunged into the business of reviewing movies . <p> In my very first review I was already jaded , observing of " Galia , " an obscure French film , that it " opens and closes with arty shots of the ocean , mother of us all , but in between it 's pretty clear that what is washing ashore is the French New Wave . " My pose in those days was one of superiority to the movies , although just when I had the exact angle of condescension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left me ecstatic and joyful . <p> Two movies in those first years were crucial to me : " Bonnie and Clyde , " and " 2001 : A Space Odyssey . " I called both of them masterpieces when the critical tides were running against them , and about " 2001 " I was not only right but early , writing my review after a Los Angeles preview during which Rock Hudson walked out of the Pantages Theatre , complaining audibly , " Will somebody tell me what the hell this movie is about ? " My review appeared the same day as the official world premiere in Washington , D.C. <p> CRASH COURSES <p> Back then , the Clark Theater in the Loop showed daily double features , 23 hours a day , seven days a week , and was run by Bruce Trinz and his assistant Jim Agnew . They told me I had to see certain films  --  not those by Orson Welles , Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock , whom I knew about , but those by Phil Karlson , Val Lewton , Rouben Mamoulian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I met Herschell Gordon Lewis , the director of " Blood Feast , " " The Gore Gore Girls , " " Two Thousand Maniacs ! " and 34 other titles . In later years , when Lewis became a cult figure , I was asked for my memories of him , but I never saw one of his movies or discussed it with him . Instead , in the living room of the boardinghouse in Uptown where Agnew lived with his family , I sat with Agnew , Nash , Lewis , a film booker and publicist named John West , and Lewis ' cinematographer , an Iranian named Alex Ameripoor , and we looked at 16mm movies on a bedsheet hung upon a wall . <p> They felt an urgency to educate me . We saw " My Darling Clementine , " " Bride of Frankenstein " and " Yankee Doodle Dandy , " with Nash dancing with James Cagney in front of the screen and telling me Cagney 's secret was always to stand on tiptoe , so there would seem to be an eagerness about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford died , Agnew and Ameripoor and some others from this group drove to Los Angeles and stood at his grave and sang " Shall We Gather at the River , " and drove back to Illinois again . Although Herschell Gordon Lewis was notorious as the director of violent and blood-drenched exploitation films , I remember only a thoughtful lover of the movies . <p> FRIENDS AND FESTIVALS <p> These years had amounted to the education of a film critic . I went to film festivals . At New York in 1967 , I met Pauline Kael and Werner Herzog and many others , but to meet those two was of lifelong importance . Kael became a close friend whose telephone calls often began with " Roger , honey , no , no , no , " before she would explain why I was not only wrong but likely to do harm . Herzog by his example gave me a model for the film artist : fearless , driven by his subjects , indifferent to commercial considerations , trusting his audience to follow him anywhere . In the 38 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outpouring of some 50 features and documentaries , he has never created a single film that is compromised , shameful , made for pragmatic reasons or uninteresting . Even his failures are spectacular . <p> I went to Cannes . There were only five or six American journalists covering it at that time . The most famous was Rex Reed , then at the height of his fame , and I remember that he was friendly and helpful and not snobbish toward an obscure Chicagoan . Andrew Sarris and Molly Haskell were there , Richard and Mary Corliss from Time , Charles Chaplin from the Los Angeles Times , Kathleen Carroll from the New York Daily News , George Anthony from Toronto and the legendary Alexander Walker from London . <p> WATCHING THE MASTERS <p> I visited many movie sets . In those days there were no ethical qualms about the studio paying the way , and I flew off to Sweden to watch Bergman and Bo Widerberg at work , to Rome for Fellini and Franco Zeffirelli , to England for John Boorman and Sir Carol Reed , to Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norman Jewison , John Huston , countless others , most memorably Robert Altman , who struck me as a man whose work and life amounted to the same thing . Those were the days before publicists kept their clients on a short leash and reduced " interviews " to five-minute sound bites . <p> I walked with Zeffirelli and Nino Rota in the garden beneath Juliet 's balcony while the composer hummed the movie 's theme to the director . On assignment from Esquire , I spent a day with Lee Marvin in his Malibu Beach house , days with Groucho Marx , Kirk Douglas , Robert Mitchum . The Marvin interview is my personal favorite . If you read it , consider that he liked it , too . <p> OPENING FRIDAY <p> ' ALL THE KING 'S MEN ' : Star-studded remake led by Sean Penn .
