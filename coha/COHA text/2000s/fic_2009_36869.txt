CHAPTER <br> 1 <br> <p> CREIGHTON WHEELER STORMED ACROSS THE BLUESTONE TERRACE , whipping off his sun visor and making a swipe at the sweat streaming down his face , then without breaking stride , angrily tossed the damp towel and visor onto a chaise . " This better be damn important . I was about to break his serve . " <p> The housekeeper who 'd summoned him from the tennis court was unfazed by his temper . " Do n't you take that tone with me . It 's your daddy wants to see you . " <p> Her name was Ruby . Creighton did n't know her last name and had never bothered to ask , although she 'd been in the family 's employ since before he was born . Any time he got out of sorts with her , she reminded him that she 'd wiped his butt and his nose , that both had been nasty , and that she had n't enjoyed doing either . It rankled to think of her being that familiar with his person , even when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulk and crossed the industrial-size kitchen to one of several refrigerators , yanking open the door . <p> " Right now , he said . " <p> Ignoring her , Creighton got a can of Coke from the Sub-Zero , ripped off the tab , and took a long drink . He rolled the cold can across his forehead . " Take one of these out to Scott . " <p> " Your tennis coach 's legs ai n't broke . " She turned back to the counter and slapped her large hand on the hunk of beef she was preparing to go into the roasting pan . <p> Something ought to be done about her sass , Creighton thought as he pushed through the swinging door and made his way toward the front of the house , where his father had a study . The door was ajar . He paused outside it , then knocked once on the doorjamb with his Coke can , nudged the door open , and strolled in , twirling the tennis racquet against his shoulder . He looked every inch the aristocrat called away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role he was perfectly suited to play . <p> Doug Wheeler was seated behind his desk , which was presidential in proportion but much more pretentious than anything inside the Oval Office . The desk was flanked by mahogany flagpoles , one for the Georgia state flag , the other for Old Glory . Ancestors glared from oil portraits hanging on opposite walls , which were paneled in stained cypress meant to last till the Second Coming . <p> " Scott 's time is money , and the clock is ticking , " Creighton said . <p> " I 'm afraid this ca n't wait . Please sit down . " <p> Creighton took a seat in one of the cordovan leather chairs facing his father 's desk and propped his tennis racquet against it . " I did n't know you were here . Were n't you scheduled to play golf this afternoon ? " He leaned forward and set his Coke can on the polished surface of the desk . <p> Frowning , Doug placed a coaster beneath the can so it would n't leave a moisture ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club , " he said . " But something urgent  --  " <p> " Do n't tell me , " Creighton interrupted . " The paper clip audit exposed an embezzlement . Damn those sneaky secretaries . " <p> " Paul is dead . " <p> Creighton 's heart gave a bump . His smile collapsed . " What ? " <p> Doug cleared his throat . " Your uncle was shot and killed in the Hotel Moultrie about an hour ago . " <p> Creighton continued to stare at him , then finally released his breath . " Well , in the immortal words of Forrest Gump . Actually his mother . ' Life is like a box of chocolates . You never know what you 're gon na get . ' " <p> His father lurched to his feet . " Is that all you can say ? " <p> " I think that says it fairly well . " <p> Creighton had never seen his father cry . He was n't crying now , but his eyes looked suspiciously moist and he was swallowing too often and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to overwhelm him , he stepped from behind his desk and moved to the wide window . He looked out over the grounds of the estate , where Mexican laborers were hand-picking weeds from colorful beds of impatiens and caladiums . <p> Quietly Creighton asked , " Did I hear you correctly , Father ? Uncle Paul was shot ? " <p> " In the forehead . Almost point-blank range . During an apparent holdup . " <p> " A holdup ? Like a robbery ? At the Moultrie ? " <p> " As unheard of as that seems . " <p> Doug ran a hand through his hair , which was thick and gray like that of his brother  --  now late brother  --  who had been his senior by only eleven months . He and Paul went to the same barber and used the same tailor . Of almost identical height and weight , they were often mistaken for each other from the back . Their sibling relationship had been almost as close as that of twins . <p> " I do n't know any details , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . " <p> " She was notified first ? " <p> " Actually , she was with him when it happened . " <p> " At the Hotel Moultrie . During the middle of a weekday . " <p> Doug came around and gave his son a hard look . " She was almost hysterical . According to the policeman . Detective actually . He took the phone from her when she could no longer speak . He told me that she had insisted on calling and telling me herself . But she managed to get out only a few incoherent words before she began crying to the point that I could no longer understand her . " He paused to clear his throat . <p> " The detective , Sanford I think he said his name was , seemed decent enough . He extended his condolences and told me I could come to the morgue if I ... if I wanted to see Paul 's body . There 'll be an autopsy , of course . " <p> Creighton looked away . " Christ . " <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't come to terms with it either . " <p> " Did they catch the guy ? " <p> " Not yet . " <p> " Where in the hotel ? " <p> " The detective did n't say . " <p> " One of the shops ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " Who would rob  --  " <p> " I do n't know , " Doug snapped . <p> A taut silence followed . Doug 's shoulders settled heavily on his tall frame . " I 'm sorry , Creighton . I 'm ... not myself . " <p> " Understandably . It 's astonishing . " <p> Doug massaged his forehead . " The detective said he would give me a full account when I get there . " He glanced at the open door but made no move toward it , clearly reluctant to leave on that errand . <p> " What about Mother ? Has she been told ? " <p> " She was here when Julie called . Naturally she 's upset , but there are arrangements that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Doug went to the bar and poured himself a shot of bourbon . " Want one ? " <p> " No thank you . " <p> Doug tossed back the drink and picked up the decanter again . " As difficult as this tragedy is to absorb , there are practical matters that must be addressed . " <p> Creighton braced himself . He disdained anything with the word practical attached to it . <p> " Tomorrow morning , I want you to go to the offices and make a personal statement to our personnel . " <p> Inwardly Creighton groaned . He wanted nothing to do with their personnel , which amounted to several hundred people , each of whom held his uncle Paul in the highest esteem while most demonstrated nothing but contempt for him whenever he graced the corporate headquarters with his presence , which was as seldom as possible . <p> Wheeler Enterprises manufactured and sold building materials of some kind . Whoopee . Fascinating . <p> His father looked over his shoulder at him . Obviously a response was expected . <p> " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll write something out tonight . I 'll call for a companywide assembly in the auditorium on the third floor at ten o'clock . Deliver your statement , then perhaps a minute of silence should be observed . " <p> Creighton nodded solemnly . " Most appropriate . " <p> Doug downed the second drink , then decisively set the empty tumbler on the bar . " You may be required to take up some of the slack while we 're sorting through all this . " <p> " All of what ? " <p> " The funeral , for starters . " <p> " Oh , of course . That 'll be an event . " <p> " No doubt , " Doug said with a sigh . " I 'll keep it as dignified as possible , but your uncle was involved in  --  " <p> " Bloody everything . He was the undeclared king of Atlanta . " <p> Doug pressed on . " Yes , and now the king is dead . To complicate matters , his death was a homicide . " Thinking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his face . " Jesus . " He glanced toward the bar as though considering pouring one more shot of Kentucky 's finest , but did n't . " The police will need our full cooperation . " <p> " What can we do ? We were n't witnesses . " <p> " But Paul 's killer must be apprehended . You will cooperate and do so willingly . Do we have an understanding ? " <p> " Of course , Father . " Creighton hesitated , then said , " Although I hope you 'll act as the family 's official spokesperson . The media will flock to us like vultures to carrion . " <p> Doug gave a brusque nod . " I 'll see to it that you and your mother are sheltered . Although I 'm compelled to make the funeral a public observance , I 'll insist on it being as low-key as possible . <p> " We must set an example to our employees , and keep the company running smoothly , which is what Paul would want us to do . To that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've left some materials in your room . You should review them tonight , bring yourself up to date on new products , where we rank in the market , our projections for next year . " <p> " All right . " As if . <p> His father seemed to read his mind . He gave him the full-on , American eagle , hard-ass treatment . " It 's the least you can do , Creighton . You 're almost thirty years old . I 've been remiss and take partial responsibility for your lack of interest in the company . I should have given you more responsibility , involved you more in the expansion of the business . Paul ... " He stumbled over the name . " Paul encouraged me to . Instead , I 've spoiled you . No more . It 's time you stepped up to the plate . Now that Paul 's gone , you 'll take over when I retire . " <p> Who was he kidding ? Himself maybe , but certainly not Creighton . His father was delusional if he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew nothing about the business or management thereof , and did n't want to know . All he wanted out of the family business was revenue . He loved his life exactly as it was and had no intention whatsoever of changing it by taking on responsibilities that any yes-man could do . <p> But now was n't the time to replay the scene he and his father had played a thousand times before , when his shortcomings and misplaced priorities were paraded for his review , when he was reminded of duty and what it meant to be a grown-up , a man , a Wheeler . Bullshit like that . <p> Changing subjects , he asked , " Has it made the news yet ? " <p> " If not yet , it will soon . " Doug moved to his desk and picked up a sheet of paper , passing it to Creighton . " Would you please call these people and notify them ? They deserve to be told by a member of the family , rather than hearing it on the news . " <p> Creighton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as personal friends of his uncle Paul , stockholders in Wheeler Enterprises , city and state officials , other prominent businessmen . <p> " And would you also break the news to Ruby ? " Doug asked . " She knows something 's up , but I did n't have the heart to tell her , especially considering the horrible circumstances . You know how much she loved and admired Paul . " <p> " Yes , I 'll do that . " And I 'll enjoy it , Creighton thought . That was one way to get back at her for sassing him . " Would you like me to go to the morgue with you ? " <p> " Thank you , but no , " Doug said . " I would n't ask that of you . " <p> " Good . I ca n't think of anything worse . " Creighton pretended to ponder it a moment , then shuddered . " Maybe a Carnival cruise . " <p> Copyright 2009 by Sandra Brown Management Ltd . <br> Continues ...        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
