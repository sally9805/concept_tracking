FOR AS LONG AS HE COULD remember , Damien Bonnespine knew somebody was there , watching him . <p> Not all the time . There were long spells between the moments when he would feel the shiver across his shoulders that made his neck hairs stand up . But eventually it would happen again and he 'd know they were back . Then for the next few minutes he 'd feel them watching him . <p> He could n't see them , and he always thought of them as a crowd of shadow men - no faces , no details , just vague silhouettes with shaded eyes turned his way . When he was little , it had creeped him out , but nothing bad ever came of it . He did n't feel threatened , just watched . <p> When he was nine he told the mom . She gave him the same scared but careful look he already recognized , even back then , as a signal that some of the thoughts that slowly bubbled up to break at the surface of his mind were best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yelped when things happened to them . How interesting it would be to know if people squirmed and yelped like that . <p> When Damien was fifteen , the mom found the cat trap and the stuff he kept in a box way back in the crawl space under the house . She took him to a doctor . There were machines and needles and stupid pictures he had to look at and talk about , but some of the doctor 's other pictures were way cool - dead people , and some who were not dead yet , but were opened up like the cats , showing slick red meat and yellowy bones . <p> One time , while he was looking at the pictures and talking about them , he felt the familiar chill across his shoulders and the tickle of hairs lifting . The doctor must have seen something in Damien 's face because he said , " What are you thinking now ? " <p> Damien told him . The man made notes on his pad and asked a lot more questions . " Were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Damien said there were no voices but he did n't think the doctor believed him . They made him take pills that filled his head with cold , silent noise . He could n't think and sometimes when he tried to talk the words got lost for a while . He stopped going to school but the mom got him lessons from the school board to do at home and a computer that connected to a tutor . But one day he was so interested in a picture he had found on the Internet that he did n't hear her come in until she was looking over his shoulder . She took the machine away . <p> Now , at eighteen , Damien Bonnespine used the public library 's computers to look at pictures . His scope had broadened and he read about interesting people : Jeffrey Dahmer , John Wayne Gacy , Richard Ramirez , Frank Spisak . He was living in an abandoned butcher 's shop near the cement plant . Some other kids slept in the rooms upstairs but they let Damien have the downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now his head was hot and busy again . <p> It was morning and Damien was thinking about the new girl who had come back to the squat with the others yesterday . She was only thirteen and her button nose and slanted , almond-shaped eyes reminded him of a cat . He was sitting on the old countertop , the wood scarred with cuts and scratches , letting his thoughts circle the girl when he felt the familiar shivery prickle . <p> He paid no attention , concentrated on the pictures in his head . Then he caught a flutter of motion to one side . He did n't turn toward it , just let his head drift a little in that direction until , from the corner of his eye , he saw the shadow man . <p> It was like seeing something on TV when thunderstorms screwed up the reception : a man shape , dark but without detail of features or clothing , speckled with dots that flickered and flashed . Damien turned his head an inch more and saw that the staticky man was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at something where his waist would be . <p> The years of catching cats had made Damien very fast . He set himself , inhaled a long , deep breath - then , as he let it out , he threw himself from the countertop and crossed the room with one long stride and a flying leap . <p> His outstretched hands sank into the dots and sparks and met clothcovered flesh beneath . The man squawked and tried to pull free but Damien yanked the shadow man toward him while shooting his head forward like a striking snake so that his forehead connected hard where the watcher 's face should be . He felt bone snap and heard a gargly yelp . <p> The man was not big but Damien was . He lifted the watcher off his feet and slammed him against the door of the long gone butcher 's walkin cooler , did it again and again until the body flopped loose in his grip . <p> He let it slide to the floor . It was still flickering and winking but that was the only movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the man had been poking . He found a belt with a row of studs on it , traced his fingers along its length to a clasp . He undid the fastener and pulled the belt free . <p> Now his hand was encased in a blur of light and dark . Damien felt for the studs , pressed them singly and in combinations , but the effect did n't change . Then the belt gave a hiss that became a hum that grew louder before it abruptly stopped . The sparks and shadows disappeared and Damien could see his hand again . It was holding a strip of metallic fabric set with a panel of buttons . From the panel came a smell of fire and ozone . <p> Damien poked at the controls some more but the thing was dead . He turned his attention back to its owner and saw a small man with a sharpfeatured face that put Damien in mind of a ferret . He had been pretty bald for someone so young but Damien could tell from the interesting angle of his neck that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The body was wearing a one-piece jumpsuit with a peculiar fastening system down the front . There were pockets but nothing interesting in them . Tied to one wrist by a looped cord was a small , flat oblong of metal about half the size of a cigarette pack . <p> Damien freed the object and examined it . He identified what looked to be a lens and next to it a pinpoint microphone . There were controls etched into the side and the upper surface . He touched them . At first nothing happened , then suddenly a screen appeared in the air , crowded with symbols and icons . There was writing , too , but Damien could n't read it . It looked vaguely Chinese . <p> Damien reached out a finger to one of the icons . Dozens of thumbnail images flooded the scene , and when he touched one of the miniatures it expanded to fill the viewing space and the figures in it began to move . <p> Damien recognized the scene : the attic in Gacy 's house . He 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything interesting . But now , as he watched , he understood . This was n't a movie . This was real . <p> He found how to minimize the image and touched another of the main screen 's icons . He watched , fascinated , for a few moments . That was Dahmer 's kitchen . There he was at the stove , humming . Another selection and Damien was watching Bundy creeping into a darkened bedroom . Then a man he did n't recognize , in a city where the cars flew , and another in some place where the sky was red . <p> He ran through the entire menu , sampling , mentally marking the ones he wanted to come back to first . Until an image brought a sharp intake of breath : the cramped space beneath his mother 's house , a figure lit by a flashlight kneeling in the back corner , putting on his heavy gloves to lift a spitting , struggling tabby out of the trap . <p> He watched his juvenile self , reliving the memory . Then he canceled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor 's office ; then the time with the stray mongrel and the propane torch . <p> But there were pictures he did n't remember , could n't have remenv bered . They showed a Damien grown into his twenties , into his thirties , showed him in places he 'd never been , with people he had n't met yet . <p> He turned his eyes from the screen and regarded the body slumped against the grimy wall . Damien had never known what people meant when they said they regretted things they 'd done . Now he almost understood . <p> He wished he could talk to the man . They had had a lot in common . As he dragged him into the cooler , Damien felt that it had been - he sought for the right word , then found it - an unfortunate way to treat his first fan . <p> He turned back to the images of the future Damien , watched the way he did things , how he controlled the situations . He thought again about the girl with the cat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author Affiliation
