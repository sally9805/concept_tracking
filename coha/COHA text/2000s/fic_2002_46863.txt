From his home in Montreal , Michael Libling reports that his literary efforts of late have been directed towards a novel , but he took time out from the book to share this tale with us . Mr. Libling 's previous contributions to F &SF; include " Timmy Gobel 's Bug Jar " ( Dec. 2001 ) , " Sitters " ( June 1996 ) , and " Mosquito League " ( Aug. 1997 ) . In the past , he has been a columnist for the Montreal Gazette and the Vancouver Sun and he hosted a radio phone-in trivia show for more than a dozen years , but nowadays he works freelance in the promotional and advertising fields when not writing fiction . <p> CLOSEST I 'VE COME TO romanticizing this whole thing is the Wolfman . Except he only had to worry about his hangup once a month . Me , it was every damn Tuesday , full moon , half moon , no moon . Tuesday nights , I grab a baseball bat , crowbar , brick , rock , trash can , any frigging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out cars . Windshields , fenders , mirrors , taillights , headlights - whatever . I 've been doing it for years . Rain or shine . Blizzard . Heat wave . I 'm out there . All over the place . You should 've seen what I did in Yosemite a few summers back . On my vacation , yet . With Laura and the kids asleep back at the campground . You should 've seen . Smashing is my thing . Others steal , maim , rape , murder , blow crap up , but me it 's smashing . You 'd think I 'd be bored with it by now . But I 'm not . You 'd think I might 've moved up to something bigger by now . Like stealing , maiming , raping , murder or blowing crap up . But I have n't . No , I 'm one of the lucky ones . just Tuesdays , just cars . And there is nothing in this world I would rather be doing . Except when I am not doing it . That 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hardly think about it . But come Tuesday nights , there 's just no stopping me . " Why ca n't you sleep on Tuesdays ? " Laura always wanted to know . She asked me so many times , I should have hired a jingle writer to set the words to music . " Just one of those things , I guess , " I told her . " Where do you go ? " I drive . " " You 're not doing things to cars again , are you Scott ? Please , tell me you 're not . " " No , of course not . I learned my lesson . " She knew only of the last time I was caught - my second time . The plea bargain . The restitution . The court-decreed therapy . The professional assessment that cited job and stress . " Are you having an affair , Scott ? Is that it ? Tell me the truth . Are you cheating on me ? " " Cross my heart . " But , fact is , she had pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not in any way she or anyone else might assume . Fact is , I 've been having an affair of sorts since I was twelve . She does not know of the first time I was caught . My junior year of college . The cop asked , " Now why would a nice young fellow like you want to go and do something so nonsensical like this ? " My reply surprised me as much as it did the cop . " Because of a girl , " I told him . " Must be quite a gal . " " Oh , yeah , " I nodded . " She 's that , all right . " I am in Serenity Room B of the Fairweather &; Baynes Funeral Home on Seymour Street in Dorrit Point , in the days when Dorrit Point was still a place people came to raise a family . Before graffiti . Before hash and meth and smack and blow and crack . Before people locked their doors . I am attending my first funeral . Paula Canta 's mother lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messy to talk about . As my mother abandons me to make her rounds of the mourners , I slip behind a wreath propped to the right of the coffin . The wreath is only slightly less large than a Ferris wheel , I think . At its center is a small painting of Mrs. Canta . A lady I do not know tells everyone who passes that this is her sister 's final self-portrait ; everyone tells the lady how beautiful and talented her sister was , and what a tragedy this is . Just when I am certain that no one will notice me , that I have found refuge , a rigid finger drills me in the small of my back . I am too frightened to move , certain that the late Mrs. Canta is about to ask me for a glass of water or worse , say a goblet of my blood . The second poke targets my forearm . It is Paula Canta . Until now , I had only.thought of her as brainy , not pretty . But pretty she is in a puffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hair in pigtails , a shiny black ribbon around each . I fumble for something to say , when she cups both hands over my ear , whispers , " I killed her , Scotty . " But she can tell by the dumb look on my face that I do n't think I heard her right , so she says it again : " I killed her , Scotty . " I peek through the wreath to see if anyone has heard besides me , but all I hear is " This was her final self-portrait , " and " What a tragedy . She was so beautiful , so talented . " Then , with those tiny hands still over her mouth , Paula grins , winks at me , as if her confession is our little secret . Who grins at their own mother 's funeral ? Winks ? " Bull , " I whisper back , but she shakes her head from side to side , her grin so tight her lips are white , and I know she has told me something I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stranger still is that Paula Canta has never said so much as two words to me before  --  words I could understand , I mean . Sure , I know her ; we 've been together since kindergarten - eight straight years . We 've just never hung out together . Not even the same birthday parties . She has her friends and I have mine , though now that I think about it , I can not recall exactly who any of her friends are ; from what I 've seen , they change all the time . " It was just after Mass . Mother wanted to make angels in the snow . We were going to make a hundred . They were going to be our special Christmas gift to Jesus , so when he looked down on Dorrit Point , he would see all the angels and smile , knowing we loved him - my mom , my dad , and me - and that Christmas meant a lot more than merely Santa Claus and presents . That 's what Mother said . And she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the angels were to go ? Yours was the first yard I chose , Scotty . And then we did every house after yours - nine or ten , at least , before the Femshaws ' . " " It was an accident , " I say . " Everybody says so . " " No , " Paula insists . " I abhor angels in the snow . " And all I 'm thinking is how many twelve-year-olds , besides English guys in beanies and short pants , use words like abhor . That was the trouble with Paula Canta : Little Miss Know-it-all , Egghead , Teacher 's Pet , Miss Big Words . Of course , as I would come to learn , that was hardly the only trouble with Paula Canta . " I hate the cold on my back , the ice down my neck . But most of all , I hate the clarinet . The incessant practicing . Mother was unrelenting . I knew the fence was beneath the snow , Scotty ; I knew the Fernshaws " fence was there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I heard about it . But I do n't mention this to Paula . For some reason , and I ca n't say why , I do n't want her to think I 'm like everybody else , even though I am starting to realize I probably am . Anyhow , it was easy enough to find , even if you did n't know where the Fernshaws lived . Just a matter of following the angels to the short black spikes poking up through the snow . Except for a few overlooked streaks of pink , the blood had pretty much been cleared by the time I got there . But it was easy to imagine Mrs. Canta " stuck like a pig " as some folks would later say , though Paula 's mom did n't look anything like a pig . All that remained of her were the tips of her last angel 's wings - top parts of the tips , that is . " Mother preferred to make her wings from the top down , " Paula explained , " whereas most people begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thinking is how many twelve-year-olds use words like whereas . jeez ! Anyhow , I was standing there at the scene , staring at the snow and the fence and not much else , when Normie Sellars runs up to me . " Where you been , Bell ? You missed the best part , man . " He was holding a jar of what looked like raspberry jelly . I had to ask , " What 's that ? " " Whaddaya mean " what ' ? A souvenir , " he said . " You should 've come earlier , man . We all got some . " " What are you going to do with it ? " Normie snorted . " Man , what a dumb cluck ! What do you think I 'm gon na do with it ? Put it in the freezer , ninny . " By the end of the week , Mr. Femshaw 's wrought iron fence had been dug up . The old man was n't happy ; he had forged and hammered the fence himself right there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorrit Point . But that was the new law in town . No iron fences under six feet tall . And none at all with pointy parts . The Dorrit Point Weekly ( or Weakly , as my father called it ) quoted Mayor Gaston as saying , " One dead angel is enough for any town . " My mother had never liked Mayor Gaston . She liked him even less after that . Paula churns up a mouthful of saliva . " That 's the only sound my mother made . Just a funny little gurgle , like your tummy makes when you 're hungry . She tried to get up , but she only made it worse for herself . For a moment , Scotty , it was as if she had a fountain smack in the middle of her neck . Her eyes never closed . I was the last sight she saw . I 'm sure that made her happy . Especially my smile . " I think I am going to be sick . " You 're lying . " I ca n't look her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can she talk like that ? About her own mother ? Her own dead mother ? " You 're a liar . " " Am I ? Whatever . " " You 're nuts . " " Killing people is n't really so difficult . You should try it , Scotty . " " Go away . " " The experience is really quite liberating . You 'll feel you can do most anything - heroisch , as the Germans might say . " " But I do n't want to kill my mother . " " You do n't ? Honest ? " " No , I do n't . " " Mother love . How terribly quaint . You are a rare duck - perhaps even an endangered species . " The mourners move en masse from Fairweather &; Baynes to the service at St. Pete 's to the Canta house , up in the new development , the Heights . My shoes pinch , my tie is too tight , my collar too stiff . I want to go home . I want to be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post-funeral gathering continues and my mother has given no indication she will be leaving anytime soon . She and the other neighbor ladies are helping in the kitchen . One of the ladies is fixing her lipstick in the tea kettle . Another reclines on a chair , her head unhinged , teabags on her eyes . Another snips a leaf from a plant on the window sill , glances about to see if anyone has noticed , quickly wraps it in a napkin and slips it into her purse . Mr. Canta sits in the living room , his elbows on his knees , his chin on his fists . Not a moment passes without someone patting him somewhere . He nods often , and smiles a smile that does n't seem to be a smile at all ; whatever it is fades as quickly as it comes . I had always thought that people were supposed to act sad at funerals , but take Mr. Canta out of the picture and this is a party . And why , of all the people here , has Paula Canta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Should n't you be crying ? " It is more accusation than question . " Kill someone other than your momma then . I 'm sure it will feel almost as good . Honestly , Scotty , these past few days have been the most exhilarating of my life . " " Why are you telling me this ? " " Because I like you . All the girls like you . You 're very handsome , Scotty Bell . You always will be . " I blush . " Shut up . Leave me alone . You 're cuckoo . " " Even if you 've never liked me , I have always liked you . " " I could tell on you . " " Yes , but you wo n't . I know you wo n't . That 's why I told you . You 're the only one who wo n't . " " What if I do ? " " Then I guess I 'd have no alternative but to tell on you . " " But I have n't done anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . " " You should be crying . Your mother is dead . You should be crying . " " Fine , " she snaps . " Fine . " Her shoulders sag and her head drops into her hands . Her chest heaves , like my father 's when he 's having an asthma attack . And just like that , she 's bawling . Eyes turn our way , as if they 're expecting something of me . I 'm not sure what the heck to do . I touch her shoulder , but it feels too weird , so I scratch my head instead . She watches me through welling pools of liquid brown , tears streaking her cheeks and wetting her smile , a smile only I can see . And it 's not anything like her father 's . Not even close . That 's when she kisses me . She kisses me right on my lips . God ! A big sloppy kiss . Worse yet , I 'm kissing her too . Jesus ! I jerk back , then up . Jesus ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , but it wo n't rub off . I ca n't get rid of the wet . And I 'm trying . Believe me , I 'm trying . With my mother leading the charge , the kitchen ladies abandon their posts and come storming toward us , armed with Kleenex and consolation . Ca n't they see what she just did to me ? How can they not have seen ? My mother prods Paula up and into her arms while the others fuss , " There , there , dear . You poor , poor thing . There , there . There , there . " With the eye that is n't buried in my mother 's titty , Paula watches as I steal away to the now vacant kitchen , her half-grin extending beyond my mother 's sleeve and meant exclusively for me . She licks the corner of her smile . What the heck is she ? What the heck is the matter with her ? I want to prove Paula wrong . I want to squeal on her , pay her back for what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure what to say or how to say it . I could tell my friends - Normie Sellars or Craig Decker , maybe but they 'll just end up doing something dumb , make everything worse . Dead moms are n't the sort of thing most guys get off on , anyhow . I try to tell my mother , but she immediately derails my effort with a tearful lament over the late Mrs. Canta . " What a tragedy . She was so beautiful , so talented . " " But , Mom , Paula told me that - " " That poor little girl . Can you imagine , losing your mother at such a young age , Scotty ? " I shake my head no , even though I can easily imagine it - more vividly than I ever could before . Jesus ! I 'm standing over my mother 's body with blood on my hands . Jesus ! There is no way I will bring up the subject again . " That poor little girl . Imagine . " Jesus ! After the funeral , Paula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she returns to school in late January , I do my best to avoid her , but soon realize there is no need . She shows not the slightest interest in me as she goes about her business . The business of being an egghead . It is as if nothing has happened . Our relationship appears unchanged from before the funeral . I am relieved , of course . Even comforted . Perhaps she was only pulling my leg , after all . But then , as the weeks go by , something odd begins to happen . The more she does n't talk to me , the more I want her to talk to me . And it 's not just hormones raging here , it is something more . The more she does n't talk to me , the more I want her to tell me things I should not know . It is as if she is bouncing a ball against the inside of my head , and I can not get her to quit . Every now and then , I skirt the perimeter of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could . I 've always found it easy to talk to girls - heck , the guys ask me for tips - but I can not talk to this girl . Not her . Not Paula . Not anymore . I might as well be a brick in the wall of the school for all she seems to notice . I think she could walk right through me were she inclined to try . BY APRIL , I have replayed Paula 's confession a million times , at least , but her unwavering disregard of me only adds to my growing certainty that it was all baloney . Heck , I would n't be surprised if she 's been embarrassed by it ever since she said it , reason enough to steer clear of me . Or maybe she does n't remember saying anything to me at all . What if her mother 's death caused her to go screwy in the head ? That sort of stuff goes on all the time in movies . Somebody dies , somebody cracks . Anyhow , that 's where my thinking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Normie Sellars 's butt and I go chasing it down . My eyes are on the ball , so I do n't realize it has come to a rest at Paula Canta 's Mary Janes , until she speaks . " Do you enjoy having me inside your head , Scotty ? " " What ? " " You heard me . " I gag some sort of response , but I 'm not sure if it 's a word in any dictionary . Or if it 's a word at all . " Well , do you ? " " What are you talking about ? " " You do n't like it , do you , Scotty ? But I do . I am enjoying the inside of your head immensely . " " Shut up . " " You might as well get used to it ; I 'm going to be there for some time . We 're a team , you know , you and me ? We 're going to.do magnificent things together . " " Shut up . " " Surely , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to speak to you for months . And now you really want me to shut up ? How terribly odd . " The guys are yelling at me to get a move on . I am holding up the game . " Very well , then , " Paula says , " since that is what you want . " " No , I  --  " But it is too late . I have been relegated yet again to brick  --  **25;304;TOOLONG status . And then she relegates me further still to the wiles of my own imagination , and what was once a passing thought becomes a field day for the shrinks . She walks right through me . Not around me . Not under me . Not by me . But through . Right through me . And as she goes she kisses me . Kisses me from the inside out . I swear . Feathers . My insides feel like feathers . Wet feathers . I stumble about , the basketball mush in my hands , as if she 's exited with my skeleton in tow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's in ballet class or something , her stay within me merely part of the routine . " Did you see ? " I 'm croaking to the guys , more than loud enough for her to hear . " Did you see ? " But she does n't turn back . " Yeah , yeah , we see , " taunts Normie Sellars . " We see an idiot named Scotty Bell . " He grabs the ball and the guys herd me back onto the court . From the sidelines , Annie McNeil and Jodi Dobrinski call to me . " Hi , Scotty , " they say , in those sing-songy voices of theirs . It was like I was the pillow case and she was the stuffing . Holy friggin " cow ! Who the heck does she think she is , Casper , the Friendly Ghost ? A ghost ? Is that what she is ? I crack up . " Stop laughing and start playing , " chides Sellars . " What 's the matter with you , anyhow ? " I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter is , idiot ! Then again , just because I think it happened does not mean it did . " Hi , Scotty , " Annie McNeil and Jodi Dobrinski giggle again . I will get to touch the breasts of each - several times - before I graduate middle school . Jodi , in particular , will be instrumental in the fine-tuning of my French-kissing technique . A year goes by . Another . ( What can I tell you ? You want the whole dan-mn story , I 'll write a book someday . For now , you 're stuck with the Reader 's Digest version . ) I keep my distance , no matter how strong the yearnings . She cooperates in full , leaving me to wallow in my grand confusion . But I 'm not the only guy who notices Paula now . Except their reasons are not entirely the same as mine . Craig Decker is typical . " So what if she 's a brain , man , she 's cute as hell . " Normie Sellars smacks his lips . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread . All the way to my mother . " I hear she 's become quite the little flirt . " " I du n no , " I say . " Poor thing . That 's what happens when you do n't have a mother to guide you , to teach you right from wrong . Let 's pray it 's only a phase . Perhaps she 's finally coming out of her shell . You do n't recover from the loss of your mother overnight , you know , Scotty ? " My dad interrupts us . He 's just gotten off the phone . His voice is shaky . " I just heard the most terrible news , " he says . " What ? " My mother braces for the worst , her hand perched at mouth . I can swear I hear her tear ducts cranking open . " Jack Runyon . He just shot Viv . Over at the hairdresser . " " Vivian . My God ! " my mother cries . " She was sitting under the dryer , reading McCall 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I guess Jack Runyon must have come out of his shell , too , I think . To the surprise of no one , Paula Canta is middle school valedictorian . Her metamorphosis is pretty much complete . No trace of her egghead days remains , not even a bit of shell . But the look is nothing new to me . How pretty she was on the day of her mother 's funeral , in that puffy black dress with white frills on the sleeves , her dark hair in pigtails , a shiny black ribbon around each . She is bubbly and funny , dramatic and captivating , welcome relief from the teachers and local officials who droned on before her . " Man , she gets hotter every day , " Craig Decker whispers in my ear . One moment she has the whole place laughing , the next cheering . Except me . I 'm sitting on my hands . Listening . Waiting for her to screw everybody else 's brains just like she 's screwed with mine . Heck , the way they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or somebody . And then - get this ! - she brings her mother into it . She tells us how meaningful this day would have been to her mother , and how much she misses her , especially - get this ! - when she practices her clarinet . And then she pulls the damn thing out from under the podium and starts playing some hymn or something she introduces with , " My mother 's favorite . " But as she 's playing and the room is sniffling - especially the moms and dads gathered in the rows behind us - she zeroes in on me . I slouch as low as I can without hitting the floor . I focus on my shoelaces . There is no way I 'm going to meet her gaze . But I do n't need to . " I killed her , Scotty , " she says , just like that , in front of the entire school . I am amazed . I am overjoyed . She has confessed , at last . And the secret is no longer mine alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even louder : " I killed her , Scotty . " Only thing I ca n't figure out is why nobody is doing anything about her . The sniffling is going strong . That 's when it hits me , she has n't skipped a beat . Never once has the clarinet left her lips . Cripes ! She 's back inside my head . " I killed her , Scotty . " I shoot to my feet . " Shut up ! " I holler . " Just shut your mouth . " Oh , man ! I have really lost it now . A hush floods the auditorium . Paula 's clarinet turns sour , frozen at her mouth , her fingers crooked above the keys . Somebody tugs at my gown from behind . " Are you nuts , man ? Sit down , " Beside me , Craig Decker tugs too . " Sorry , " I mumble . " It was an accident . " Mr. Conway , the gym teacher , and Mrs. Ladino , the principal , rush to the end of my aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions compact and restrained , as if this makes them less conspicuous . Sobbing , Paula lowers the clarinet . Assorted teachers and officials bombard her with comfort . Her father rushes to the stage , his fist vowing vengeance to me as he leaps up the steps . Close behind is my mother , a wad of Kleenex in hand ; she shakes her head at me , disappointed , crushed by what I 've done , her hand at her throat . Guilt scalds my cheeks , my forehead , and then : " I killed her , Scotty . " " Shut up ! " I shout again . A hush descends upon the hush . I am escorted to the rear of the auditorium , Mr. Conway and Mr. Longacre , the science teacher , posted to either side of me . " What the devil has got into you , boy ? " Mr : Conway wants to know . " That 's not like you , Bell . " Paula composes herself . She plays the last eight bars or so of whatever it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capping it with some cornball message about overcoming adversity , underscored by a forgiving glare in my direction . Three hundred heads turn to get a glimpse of me , to see if I am sufficiently contrite . I pretend to be . When she finishes , everybody pretty much goes nuts . And all I 'm thinking is how I 've beat them all to it . I win two trophies , one for basketball and another for baseball . I also receive some kind of award for school spirit ; it comes with a check for a hundred bucks . But I am not permitted to go up on stage to collect . My achievements and my diploma are delivered without ceremony to my seat . A couple of days later , I am put on Ritalin . Whatever makes them happy . ( Not that I was alone in that regard . There were so many of us being put on the junk back then , the PTA had every school in the district checked out for lead in the water fountains and asbestos and some other crap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be causing all this craziness , they figured . Something tangible , they hoped . ) Three months into high school , my grades are in the toilet . " You were on the Honor Roll , Scotty . Now you 're barely getting by . You 're not yourself , sweetheart . " No kidding . My parents are desperate to find out what 's going on . Psychologists . Psychiatrists . Specialists in this . Specialists in that . I run the therapeutic gauntlet . They think they can see inside my head , but not one of them spots Paula . I 'm taken off Ritalin and put on Surmontil . I 'm taken off Surmontil and put on Sinequan . I 'm taken off Sinequan and put back on Ritalin . My mother scours my room for drugs . Weekly . ( My prescriptions do n't count . ) She rummages my school books , my backpack , my papers , my closet , my drawers . My father quizzes me as to whether I am sexually active with girls or , God forbid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , son , if , if , if- ? I do n't want you ending up like that Tremblay boy or something ..... Everybody in Dorrit Point knew about Maury Tremblay over on Summerfield Road , his secret cellar , and the three young boys he kept there ( all plucked fresh from the streets of Detroit ) , until his Grandma got new batteries for her hearing aid and found him out . Together , they lecture me on drug and alcohol abuse and promise to help me in any way possible , if I 'll only tell them what is troubling me . " There 's no shame in asking for help , Scotty . No shame in that at all . " They screen my phone calls , interrogate my friends , call the school to verify that I am in class , meet with my teachers , the guidance counselors , the principal . Once , I overhear them on the phone with Paula . I put the pieces of the conversation together . " I hardly know him , " I figure she 's telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , I think , in all our years of school . Not counting my mother 's funeral , of course . " " Your mother was a wonderful lady . Sorry to bother you , dear . " " That 's okay , Mrs. Bell . I wish I could help . He was always a very nice boy . " They threaten to take away my sports , but the high school needs all the help it can get , especially since Wiley " Big Gun " Gunderson was sent up to IYC - the Iverson Youth Correctional Center - for attempted rape . Besides , every professional they speak to advises against it - except for the jerk who lived outside the county . " A Fullerton Vikings supporter , " my father scoffs . On the bright side , I 've still got friends - more than ever , really - and girls continue to like me , thank God . Guys on the team have dubbed me M.K. , short for Makeout King . Meanwhile , Paula has n't spoken to me since middle school graduation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And like before , I begin to waver , doubting my own sanity , wondering if any of it has been real , if demonizing Paula has n't been a unilateral effort . Going crazy happens to kids my age all the time - Wiley " Big Gun " Gunderson , a case in point . But , once again , just when I have reached the point of absolving Paula altogether , she comes to my rescue , affirming the sanity of my insanity . At the end of our sophomore year , our trays tap in the cafeteria , sending tremors through our respective Jell-Os . Both green . Mine with whipped cream , hers without . I venture a quiet hello . I want her to hear , but I am hoping she will not . It is a test , of course . If she passes , I fail . If she fails , I still fail . Paula speaks without turning . " I assume this means you finally have something to tell me ? You have been such a disappointment . " " Huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just saying " hi , " that 's all . " " So then you do n't have anything to tell me ? " " l do n't know what you want me to say . " " You know exactly what I want to hear . " I rack my brain . " I 'm sorry ? " " Is that a question or an apology ? " I gulp . " I 'm sorry about the graduation thing , if that 's what you mean . I do n't know what got into me . " " Really ? You do n't know ? After all this time , you still do n't know ? " " I do n't . " " What got into you , Scotty Bell , was me . And you can be absolutely certain , I am still there . " " Let 's just forget it , okay ? Forget I said anything . I was just trying to be nice , that 's all , and you - " " You are absolutely hopeless . By now I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been killing cats and dogs . And Normie Sellars , he 's totally into guns . But you- you- " She has yet to glance my way , while I have yet to take my eyes from her . She places a carton of chocolate milk on her tray . " When Mrs. Bannister died last autumn , I was hoping , at last , you had something to do with it . She was such a nasty bitch . Not a terribly erudite history teacher , either - and absolutely horrid toward you . How you put up with her repeated humiliations in class I will never know . But then I heard it was cancer , and I knew that was far too sophisticated for you . You do n't know how to give people cancer , do you , Scotty ? " I shake my head . " No , I did n't think you did . Not yet , anyhow . " I lay my hand on her shoulder , turn her to face me . She 's staring at my lips and I 'm staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cafeteria - that jerk Rodney Steen - and leaves me in her wake . She does not walk through me , a courtesy for which I am truly grateful . I watch as she kisses the prick . She 's always kissing somebody these days , it seems , except me . I wonder what a kiss from her would be like , now that I know how to kiss , though I ca n't for the life of me understand why I 'd bother to wonder such a thing . That night , a Tuesday night , I grab my baseball bat , walk three streets over and smash out the headlights of a BMW . Just like that . AS MY SENIOR YEAR winds down , I win a baseball scholarship to USC , despite less than stellar grades . Coach Murchison tells me they love the way I swing a bat and the way I pick them out of the dirt at first . " You got soft hands , son , soft hands . " In that same week , my old friend Craig Decker runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also takes out Normie Sellars 's mom , who is walking the dog . Normie chases Craig down , shoots him dead , and bashes in his face with the rifle butt . " What a tragedy , " my mother weeps . " They were such nice boys . When you were little , Scotty , you were such good pals - the three of you . " " Yeah . We were . " I try to remember when we stopped being pals and why , but I ca n't come up with anything specific . We went our separate ways , that 's all ; high school does that a lot to kids . Funny thing is , this is the first time I can recall thinking about us not being friends . " It 's getting worse around here every day , " says my dad . Increasingly the bearer of bad tidings , he presents his latest gem . " And did you hear what some idiot did to your old gym teacher , this afternoon , Scotty ? " " Mr. Conway ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have killed him . " " Who would 've - ? " " Some girl . A student . I do n't know . Can you imagine , a girl ? " It frightens me , " Mom says , her shudder redundant . " Sign of the times , " laments Dad . " All that trash on television , the movies ..... " " And that music , " Mom adds . " That music is hateful . " " Maybe it 'll all get better around here after Paula Canta goes off to college , " I say . They turn my way . I shrug , sheepish . They do not know why I would say such a thing ; I do not know why either . My second funeral is Craig Decker 's . I catch a flat on the way to the church . By the time I dig out the jack , best I can manage is the cemetery . I arrive as they are putting him into the ground . Only when Paula wraps herself around my upper arm do I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A shame it did n't go the other way , " she whispers , " Craig was a vastly superior lay . " I try to shake her off , but I 've learned my lesson about making scenes . " At the very least , you might as well give them the impression you are consoling me , " she says , her cheek against my shoulder . " Go away . Please . " " And if I choose not to , what are you going to do ? Rape me ? Stab me ? Run me over ? Or is shooting more your style ? In all honesty , Scotty , you do n't really want me to go away . After all , are n't I the girl of your dreams ? " " The best part about going off to school is not having to see you anymore . You 're crazy , Paula . You 've always been crazy . " " We have a lot in common then . " " Up yours ! " A mourner turns , hushes me . I mumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father frowns . I lower my head . Paula offers up a mournful smile . My mother waves to her . Next night , on the fringes of Fullerton , I lay waste to every shitbox in sight . A good thirty or forty . Mostly Fords , Chryslers , Chevys , Pontiacs . A lot of that crap in Fullerton . Fairweather &; Baynes Funeral Home moves from Seymour Street to a whole new building up in the Heights . Looks like one of those plantation mansions you see in Civil War movies . Big white pillars . The works . Anyhow , they put a picture of Mayor Gaston cutting the ribbon on the front page of the Weekly . He says , " Few towns of comparable size can boast a more efficient mortuary service . It is yet the latest feather in our community 's hat . " After that , my mother tries to cancel our subscription , but the paper is free and continues to be delivered without interruption . ALL SUMMER LONG , I ached for what the shrinks call closure ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I could just get to Labor Day , get on that plane to California , I figured everything would work out . Out of sight , out of mind - that sort of reasoning . And I guess I might have made it , too , had I not gone to Jodi Dobrinski 's party . Dumb of me , I know , but it was going to be a long time before I 'd have another chance to see most of my friends again - the surviving ones , anyhow . Besides , Ernie Yawker was throwing a bash , too , and last I heard he and Paula were into it hot and heavy . I put the odds of her showing up at Jodi 's as slim . I was two beers in before I spotted her . She was on the sofa under some guy who was n't Ernie Yawker . She wore denim cutoffs and a pink tank top . Her long dark hair was tied back in a ponytail that was n't going to be a ponytail much longer . I debated clearing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance floor between us . I was keeping my distance , watching the two of them go at it , when Jodi sidled up , and patted me on the back . She had to shout to be heard above the music . " Poor , poor Scotty , after all these years , you still have a thing for her , do n't you ? " I had to shout , too . " Do not . " " Right . Then you must be the only one who does n't know it . " Just as the music stopped , I piped up , " I hate her . " Perfect timing as usual . The whole room cracked up . But Scotty Bell doing something stupid was hardly a novelty and my entertainment value lasted only as long as it took the next song to cue up . " Come to think of it , " Jodi continued , " you must be about the only guy in our class she 's never made it with . " " And that 's the way it 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Guess again , lover boy . " Paula was wending her way through the dancers , heading straight for me . Her hair now fell about bare shoulders , all soft and springy - like she was coming at me fresh from a shampoo commercial . The place was mobbed . Best I could do was squeeze up against a wall and hope she 'd lose sight of me . But she did n't stop till her nose was in my chest . She stood there , wobbling a bit , sizing me up , lips wet , eyelids lowered . She looked sexy , and kind of goofy , too . I threw up my hands . " What ? What now ? How you gon na screw with my head this time ? " Next I knew she was holding my face and her tongue was wrestling with my tonsils . She 'd been drinking and might 've been stoned , too , considering all the weed being passed about . " You 're drunk , " I said , in an effort to fend her off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . ) " Lucky you , " she replied . She could n't get enough of me . She was sucking face so damn hard , I licked my lips for blood ; all I tasted was strawberry wine and Paula Canta . We ended up in Jodi 's bedroom , no protest from me . As long as Paula did n't use that mouth of hers for talking , she was something to behold . She could n't get enough of me ? Hell , I could n't get enough of her . I could n't care less she was pissed , I was going to make the most of the opportunity . For years , she 'd been jerking me up and down like a catcher 's mask . She owed me , and I saw no harm in collecting . I suppose we could have kept it up all night , if Paula would n't have started to blubber . Yeah , blubber . Tears were the last thing I expected of her . She was setting me up , I was sure . But if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's passing , it was that no matter how much deeper it might get you , a guy is always expected to ask , " What 's the matter ? What 's wrong ? " " You , " she sniffed , and rolled off my chest to the side . " You 're hard work , Scotty Bell . " " I 'm hard work ? Then what are you ? " I said . She laughed ; it rang warm , genuine and out of character . I loved it . Wanted more . I held her close , the salt of her tears on my tongue . Whatever defenses she had mustered against me were coming down , or so I thought . I admit , her vulnerability added to the turn-on . " You 've exhausted me , " she sobbed , gasping so much it took several tries before all the words got out and another couple before I could make out what she was saying . Then she added , " But I think today - today should finally do it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " she purred . I groaned , tensed the arm that held her . Here we go again . " Do n't tell me you 've got AIDS or something ? Cripes , Paula .... " She softened , pecked me reassuringly . " No , not quite . It 's just that you 've always been so frightened of me and .... " " Have not . " " Of course , you have . I would be , too , if I were twelve and someone told me they had just killed their mother . " " But you did n't really , did you ? " " I knew the fence was there , Scotty . Mother knew it was , too . At least , in her heart she did . " " So you did n't kill her then ? And all this time " Oh , but I did , Scotty . I did kill her . More often than not , suicide is simply murder by proxy . " " You really should get help . I mean , if you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . I 'm lying here with you , are n't I ? " " We 're a pair , all right . " I pulled her closer . " You 're going to think this is really nuts , but I used to think you were a ghost . " " Pardon me ? " " Remember that day in the schoolyard , when I ran down the ball ? I could 've sworn you walked through me . It was so weird , I could 've  --  " Perhaps I did . " " Yeah . Right . " " Think about it , Scotty , all the sorts of things that can pass right through a person . A sound . A chill .... " " A bullet , " I said . " ... Feelings . Fears . A stare . A glare . And all those nasty bugs and germs .. bacteria and viruses .. and God-knows-what . " " And which , Paula - which one are you ? " She nipped me on the earlobe . " Take your pick , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was n't feeling all that great myself , mixing meds with booze and such . Anyhow , I thought it best to let her sleep it off . Paula goes east and I go west . There is no further contact between us . Not a phone call . Not a postcard . Not an e-mail . Not regards passed on by a mutual acquaintance . Yet not a day goes by that I do not see her . She is with me when I go to bed , with me when I wake up . I graduate university , kick around the minors for a couple of seasons , get a real job , marry Laura , father two daughters , vandalize more cars , get another job , divorce , and struggle with the fact that the life I strive to lead is always secondary to the life that possesses me . I see her at eighteen and nineteen and twenty . Make no mistake , I am not speaking in any figurative way . I see her at twenty-six and twenty-seven and twenty-eight . Always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were standing before me . I see her at thirty-three and thirty-four and thirty-five . Always , I know exactly what she looks like , how she has aged . They say I waited for her in the lobby , followed her up to her room , but that 's not the way it happened at all . She taps the table with a manicured fingernail , as red as the wine in the glass before her . " Is this a coincidence or are you stalking me ? " " Stalking , " I tell her . " Same old Scotty Bell , " she smiles , " as blunt as ever . " With the toe of her black leather pump , she turns a vacant chair toward me . " Well , are you going to stand there staring the whole evening , or are you going to join me ? " " I ca n't , " I say . " Do n't tell me you 're still afraid of me - not after all these years ? " " No , of course not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Really ? Too busy for a drink with an old friend ? " " I hardly think of you as that , " I correct her . She feigns injury . " Have n't you learned by now , Scotty , people from your past are always old friends when you encounter them , even if they never actually were ? " Her finger traces the rim of her glass . " ' Give me a bowl of wine . In this I bury all unkindness . " " " What ? " " It 's Shakespeare . " " Oh . " Every man who passes glances her way , some more shamelessly than others . But she pays them no heed ; she is accustomed to it . I hate hotel bars . Every gesture is foreplay . " I 'm here with the Symphony , " she says . " Yes , I know . The Internet filled me in . It 's how I found you . " " Then you also know about the clarinet . " Her sheepishness is more coy than sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To say the least . " " Mother would be so proud . " " You have n't changed . " " You 're making my neck ache . It would be so much easier if you would simply sit , Scotty . " I shake my head , check the time . " I smash cars . " " Pardon me ? " I take the seat . " On Tuesday nights , I smash cars . Been doing it since high school . " " Really ? " Her eyes light up . " And people - people , too ? " she asks eagerly " Just cars . " She is disappointed . " Are you certain ? " " Pretty much . " " What about your parents ? Still alive ? " " Yes . In Florida . West Palm . " Again , I have disappointed her . " Funny , I had such high hopes for you . I always had you pegged for a parricide , at the very least . " " Parricide ? " " A parent killer . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To me . " And your dad ? " I ask . " He 'll be gone ten years this May . Heart disease . " " I 'm sorry , Paula . " " Do n't be . Ever since Mother passed on , he was a most dreadful mope . I 'd had enough . " She laughs . " So tell me , are you in Boston on business or strictly to drive a stake through my heart ? " The question catches me off guard . " So you know then ? " " It is rather obvious . What was it I kissed you - two , three times ? " " Three , counting that inside-out one in the schoolyard . " " Oh , yes . And even with that you progressed no further than petty vandalism ? Yes , I 'd say it 's quite clear what you are - or what you think you are . " " Then why are n't you running from me ? Why are n't you screaming for help ? " " Call me a cockeyed optimist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result may go the other way . Perhaps our fourth kiss will do the trick . Perhaps tomorrow , you 'll fly down to Florida and give your parents a big hug and a kiss from me . " Again , I glance at my watch . She sighs . " Well , I guess we might as well get on with it . You were a rather adept lover as I recall . " She signals the barkeep , orders a bottle of Pinot Noir . I order a Sam Adams . " Cheers , " she says , as she taps her glass against mine . " To us . " " To us , " I repeat , and I lean across the table and kiss her full on the mouth . " You kiss like a married man , Scotty . You 're so desperate for something different . " " Just hungry , " I tell her . " It 's been a while since the divorce . " " Stability never was your strong suit . " " Thanks to you . " " Touche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take ? " I ask her . " To see who wins ? " " Yeah , I guess . " She continues to find me amusing . " I hardly think we 'll stop at kisses , dear boy . " And all I 'm thinking is how beautiful she is , even when she 's patronizing . Sometime after midnight , I head over to Brookline , in a Mercedes kind of mood . I still ca n't believe the people they trotted out , the nonsense they had to say about me . Some shrink . " Such behavior is inevitably linked to a form of psychopathology  --  psychosis , severe antisocial personality disorder , and the like . Violence is in no way atypical , occurring in some twenty-five percent of cases , murder in roughly two percent . " Some cop . " Two priors . Both vandalism . The guy likes smashing up cars , that 's for sure . " Annie McNeil . " I was n't surprised when I heard , only surprised it had n't happened sooner . All the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this special thing for Paula , going way back to middle school , I think . " Jodi Dobrinski . " She was drunk out of her mind , but somehow he got her up to my bedroom . She was a mess , just lying there when we found her . We all told her to press charges , but she was going off to school the next day or so and just wanted to leave the whole thing behind her . " My mother . " Surely , losing your mother at so young an age must have an effect . I heard stories about her being a little wild with the boys . Perhaps she led him on in some way . Scotty was always very impressionable . " My dad . " We got him all kinds of help . I do n't care what you say , it was the system that let him down . Nothing 's the way it used to be . The movies . That noise they call music . Everybody 's got an attitude - a chip on their shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Bigs . " Laura . " He never raised a hand to me or the children . Still , when he was with us , he never seemed to be with us , if you know what I mean . " Had they bothered to shut up and listen , I would have told them the truth . But they were all so full of themselves , so damn certain they had me nailed , the truth would n't have done me a lick of good . Besides , the way I size it up , Paula had to have been incubating inside more than a few of them by then , with stuff like stealing , maiming , raping , murder , and blowing crap up just around their respective corners . Smashing , too , no doubt . The whole thing is so simple , really . Too simple , I suppose . Paula Canta was the virus , Scotty Bell was the vaccine .
