May 28 , 1869 <p> The corpses of eleven white males lay strewn in a wide clearing bathed by the pale light of a full moon . Stars twinkled above the unseeing eyes of those supine ; dozens of ants explored facial orifices . The stained clothing the men wore evidenced that bodily fluids had flowed abundantly , and even though the soil had absorbed nearly all , the immediate surroundings glistened with traces of blood and urine , globs of vomit and droplets of sweat , saliva and tears . A few bodies were in close physical contact  --  legs overlapping , shoulders brushing  --  but most lay by themselves . <p> The dense primeval forest encircling the glade had very large canopy trees , royal palms , fruit trees , and undergrowth . Bats were squeaking and owls hooting . Daytime birds slept in their nests or in the holes of old trees . Far away a wild dog howled . A deer raised his head and ears , stopped chewing the cud . The stench of death discouraged rodents from entering the area , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fruits , they had decided hours earlier , then took to the forest , minding out for reptiles . <p> A human sneeze brought animal life to a standstill . <p> Henry Reeve opened his eyes to dark greenness and knit his brow in complete bafflement . After a moment , it came to him that he was facing blades of grass . He tried to scratch his itching nose but found that his hands were tied behind him . A second sneeze dislodged the remaining two ants from his left nostril . Lifting his head , Reeve looked around ; the hairs at the back of his neck stood on end . He retched twice before vomiting a mouthful of bile . Memories returned while he spat out the bitterness in his mouth . <p> He and his brothers in arms had been arranged in a single line , standing side by side . They had faced twenty-odd Spanish infantrymen wearing white-and-blue-striped drill uniforms and panama hats , aligned in two rows . Those in the front had had their right knees and left feet firmly planted on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kneeling comrades . Their commanding officer had barked out orders at the top of his lungs . As they took aim , their faces had been partially concealed by the brims of their hats and the Berdan rifles on their shoulders . A blinding volley was the last thing he remembered . <p> Reeve wondered whether he was dead or alive , dreaming or awake . Had he fainted after the fusillade ? He turned over on his back and intense pain shot through his left arm and the right side of his rib cage . He was alive and awake , for sure . It seemed he had caught a slug , maybe two . Grimacing , he managed to sit up . With blurred vision , he inspected himself . The bloodstain on his long-sleeved shirt started five or six inches below his left shoulder and ran down to the cuff . There was another one below his right armpit . Oh Lord , how it hurt . Next , he glanced at the corpses to his right , then to his left . Had anyone else survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the females of the species were the only respondents . <p> All his comrades appeared to be dead ; none moved . How could he be alive ? " ' Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me , ' " he muttered , his gaze roving about the corpses . <p> Staring at the edge of the clearing , recollections dissolved reality . St. Paul 's Lutheran Church on a cold Sunday morning . His father , in his dark blue frock coat , delivering one of his fire-and-brimstone sermons from the pulpit . His mother , in her black velvet bonnet and brown overcoat , sitting in the front pew , eyes fixed on his dad , making it appear she was listening for the first time ever to what she had lent an ear to on innumerable occasions over twenty years . His sisters alongside mom , daydreaming to conceal their boredom and occasionally blowing on their cupped hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heron taking flight , signaling that animal life had resumed , brought Reeve back to the present . <p> Now , near death , he was wishing he had said good-bye personally , rather than leaving a letter on the kitchen cupboard . But he had dreaded that they would have moved heaven and earth to prevent him from joining the expedition , arguing he was a kid . That 's what they had done four years earlier when , at fifteen , he joined the New York Volunteers as a drummer . In hindsight , he had been a kid then . <p> Well , here he was : still a kid , a stupid kid at that , dying merely two weeks after landing . A fellow who drops and loses his revolver in the middle of the battle is stupid . He had been searching frantically in the tall grass when the Spaniard had rushed him into surrendering . Butt under his armpit , finger on the trigger , the soldier had moved his rifle 's muzzle up and down several times , excitedly shouting in Spanish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thrown his arms up , more in despair than to concede defeat . <p> Twelve in all : ten Cubans and two Americans . Eighty-five Americans had joined the two-hundred-man expedition , and he had met most of them , including the other Yankee taken prisoner . Tough-looking old chap in his thirties , dark hair , Union army officer 's hat . Reeve had addressed him respectfully aboard ship  --  " Glad to make your acquaintance , sir "  --  trying to be polite with a stranger on account of the fact he was much older , had seen action , and came from where Reeve did , but he had forgotten his name . <p> Helping himself with the heels of his ankle-jacks , Reeve turned on his buttocks , sniffled back mucus , and spat . Moving his gaze from one corpse to the next , he spotted a body lying prone , eight or nine feet away . In the dead of night , he could n't be sure if it was his fellow countryman , but it certainly looked like him . His hat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what appeared to be four exit wounds on the man 's back , so the Yank had presumably taken the .54-caliber flat-based bullets in his chest and belly . He felt proud of his compatriot ; the man had n't whined , despaired , or asked to be pardoned . <p> Then Reeve realized he had n't either , nor had any of the Cubans . Well , maybe all had been too scared to implore forgiveness  --  or had assumed retribution sensible , under the circumstances . Two days earlier , General Jordan had put to death four Cuban prisoners who fought for Spain . The general had set the rules of engagement on board while haranguing his men . Cubans who peaceably campaigned for self-determination , Jordan had made known , were exiled . But should one who took up arms against the Spanish Crown surrender or be captured , regardless of his nationality , he was shot on the spot . Consequently , Jordan had gone on , Spanish regular soldiers or Cuban volunteers captured by the Liberation Army would be given identical treatment . <p> Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live by the sword , you die by the sword . <p> But it had n't seemed fair enough at all when his wrists had been tied behind his back , the enemy platoon retreated twenty or so paces , and cartridges were loaded into the rifles ' breeches . The colonialists had noticed right away that he was a foreigner because he had n't understood a word of their patois . And if those with Spanish blood in their veins were executed without ceremony , an alien could n't expect better treatment . <p> The young American concluded that the Lord God , in His wisdom , had spared him . So he should start doing something . He tried to stand up by tucking his legs underneath him and bending forward . Each of the first three unsuccessful attempts sent waves of pain sweeping through his body . Breathing hard , recovering for his next try , his father 's voice resonated in his head : " Fear thou not ; for I am with thee : be not dismayed ; for I am thy God : I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yea , I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness . " <p> On the seventh attempt , Reeve got to his feet . No sooner had the throbbing decreased than his bladder emitted a distress signal . For an instant , he pondered what to do ; then it registered that he had no choice . He let urine flow and breathed a sigh of relief , then was filled with disgust as it ran down his leg , soaking the trouser and the sock , seeping into his boot . Blood was trickling down his arm and rib cage as well , the result of his attempts to get on his feet . His mouth was parched . <p> After the long piss , Reeve turned his head left and right to catch a glimpse of what kept him bound . He clucked his tongue in frustration . How idiotic of him . He could n't see behind his back . He needed a knife . No , wait . He ran the risk of slashing his wrists . Then what ? <p> Reeve mulled things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trilled tentatively to herald dawn . God Almighty had reserved a blessing for him : to be the sole survivor among twelve men executed by firing squad . He was under His protection . He would not die . The Lord wanted Henry Reeve to perform work for Him . Here in Cuba , maybe . It was foolish to stand here doing nothing . His comrades would n't revive if he stood by their side . It had not been the Lord 's will to spare anyone else . <p> Henry Reeve took a deep breath and started wending his way to the southern edge of the glade as a ray of sunlight broke over the horizon . <p> A little after eight o'clock in the morning , three rebels were steering their mounts around teaks , mahoganies , cedars , and oaks ; granadillos and guayacans ; mango , tamarind , and mamey trees  --  all smaller than a few gigantic ceibas . From the humus-covered soil , lianas climbed over trunks and branches . Several types of ferns prospered at spots hardly ever touched by the rays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parrots , and other songbirds were warbling as woodpeckers pecked holes and reptiles slithered slowly toward nests where defenseless young pigeons were waiting for their parents to feed them . The fragrances and odors emanating from thousands of plants and herbs and fruits and flowers combined with the myriad smells the wild fauna exuded to create the tropical forest 's inimitable perfume . The temperature was already high . <p> The men  --  a white twenty-nine-year-old lieutenant and two Cuban Yorubas in their thirties who a year earlier had been slaves  --  had departed from their base camp at dawn under orders to look for survivors and search corpses for documents . The officer 's horse , a fine fourteen-hand gray Andalusian stallion , was tacked up from head to back in fine calfskin leather . The Yorubas rode smaller Creole horses bareback  --  an old emaciated gelding and a very tired mare  --  which they steered by pulling pieces of rope circling the bridge of the animals ' noses . The white man 's feet were shod in fine boots that had spurs affixed to the heels ; his barefoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounts when necessary . <p> The officer was wearing a fairly new straw hat with a four-inch brim and a narrow black cotton hatband , a white collarless dress shirt , and trousers . The rifle holster on the saddle 's right side nestled a Model 1859 Sharp carbine . The holster hanging from the right side of his belt stored an 1851 Colt navy revolver . On his left , inside leather sheaths , hung a sword and a hunting knife . <p> His shirtless companions were wearing stained , frayed straw hats and soiled and ragged mid-calf pantaloons . They gripped long narrow-bladed machetes , the sort used to cut thick vegetation , now turned into offensive weapons by those destitute insurgents who had n't been able to steal , snatch from the enemy , or recover from the battlefield a cavalry saber , a sword , or the ultimate luxury , a firearm . <p> Born in Santiago de Cuba to wealthy Cuban landowners , Martfn Herrera had set foot in the northern coast of Oriente a week earlier . The Yorubas had been born and raised nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantation and mill near the town of Bijar , and knew the territory like the back of their hands . The officer rode behind BartolomT , the youngest of the scouts . His livelier stallion appeared resigned to the relaxed walk of the much older gelding . <p> They were wasting their time , Herrera thought . The expeditionary force had been resoundingly defeated at the battle of Las Calabazas . General Jordan had fled , leaving behind a tiny pocket of resistance , fifteen or twenty men covering the retreat . They had either died fighting or been shot after surrendering . Rumor had it that when the captain general appointed Count Valmaseda chief of military operations in Camagney and Oriente , he had made clear he wanted no prisoners . <p> They would be stumbling on corpses covered with flies . He was supposed to frisk them , yet at no time had he touched a cadaver . The officer was hoping against hope that the battle-field would n't be located . Absorbed in his thoughts , it took him a moment to notice that BartolomT had stopped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mount . Francisco , the older slave in the rear , did the same . <p> BartolomT turned , directed a meaningful glance at the white man , and , by tilting his head to his right , indicated that someone was straight ahead ; then he bent over the neck of his horse to get out of the way . Staring intently , Herrera drew the carbine , cocked its hammer . Yep , between the tree trunks and lianas , someone was staggering along . An enemy scout ? No , he was on foot and moved at right angles to their course , westbound . The officer gently squeezed his mount 's sides with his calves and pulled slightly on the left rein . BartolomT and Francisco followed . They were fewer than forty feet from the stranger when Herrera reined back the horse and took aim . <p> " Who goes there ? " he boomed . <p> Reeve froze , swung left toward the scouts , and squinted . Herrera took in the young pale face , the labored breathing , the bloodstains . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uncocked it , reholstered it . A wounded and disoriented Spaniard ? <p> " Who goes there ? " he asked again , curious now , drawing the revolver and steering his horse closer to the stranger . <p> Reeve grasped that if two shirtless blacks rode with an armed white man , all three had to be revolutionaries ; the Spanish army provided uniforms to black and mulatto volunteers . He tried to speak , but nothing audible came from his lips . <p> " What ? " Herrera shouted in Spanish . <p> " Viva Cuba Libre , " whispered Reeve , almost exhausting his knowledge of Spanish . <p> " What ? " <p> " Viva Cuba Libre , " Reeve repeated in a normal tone as he leaned on the trunk of a granadillo . <p> Herrera dismounted , put his gun away , handed over the reins to Francisco , and hurried to the wounded man . The foreign accent made the lieutenant realize he had stumbled on an American expeditionary . Herrera did n't know a word of English . <p> " You came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viva Cuba Libre . " <p> " General Jordan ? " the lieutenant asked , trying to overcome the language barrier . <p> " Yes , General Jordan . I am his adjunct . Please , untie me . " <p> " What ? " <p> Reeve turned . Herrera cast a quick glance at him , extracted his knife , and got to work on the piece of rope , minding Reeve 's wrists . It took him almost a minute . When the American felt his hands free , he clutched at the trunk of the tree , closed his eyes , and slid to the ground . <p> " Agua , " he said . <p> With a few paces , the lieutenant reached his horse and removed a tin-lined copper canteen from the saddlebag . He pulled out the stopper , strode back to Reeve . The American drank avidly . <p> " Gracias , " he said , wiping his mouth , then stared at his bruised wrists . <p> Herrera recapped the canteen and reflected on what to do next , gazing at his find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his commanding officer , Brigadier General Figueredo , had set up a three-hammock infirmary staffed with a male nurse . Taking his fi nd back to camp immediately was the right thing to do ; it would temporarily excuse him from turning corpses over . He beckoned his subordinates to join him . Both Afro-Cubans dismounted and , pulling the horses behind them , reached the white men . <p> " This man , patriot . We go back camp now . He rides my saddle . I ride pillion . Get him to mount . " <p> Francisco and BartolomT grunted and nodded to signify their understanding . Herrera held the ropes of the Creole horses and the lead of his mount as a groaning Reeve was lifted to the lieutenant 's saddle . Francisco ripped open the left sleeve of the American 's shirt and quickly inspected a superficial bullet wound . Walking around the horse , he lifted the shirt and stared at a gash in Reeve 's rib cage . The freed slave swiftly glanced at his surroundings , then hurried to a nearby thicket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed his feet into the stirrups . Francisco came back with a handful of leaves in the crown of his hat , tore off two long strips of cloth from the right leg of his dirty pantaloon , and covered the rib cage wound with leaves , keeping them in place with one of the strips . <p> " Gracias , " said Reeve to Francisco . " Muchas gracias , " he repeated , glancing next at BartolomT . <p> The arm wound was treated in the same manner . After tying the second knot , Francisco 's eyes went to the lieutenant . <p> " Good . Let 's get going , " the white Cuban said . <p> The Yorubas simply nodded . <p> BartolomT helped the lieutenant mount pillion on his stallion and handed him the reins . Both blacks jumped up onto their mounts ; Herrera waited for BartolomT to take the lead , then giddyap . By closing his eyes and biting his lips , Reeve suppressed the scream of pain he wanted to let out . But having been rescued filled him with joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be fine , God willing . The Cuban war was starting ; he hoped the patriots would n't kick out the Spaniards before he had the chance to fight a few battles and show them what a chap from Flatlands could do . <p> June 1 <p> Capt . Emilio Battle was staring at the dozing patient with a furrowed brow . How old was this kid ? He struck Battle as being sixteen at the most . It was an act of desperation on the part of the Cuban revolutionary junta in New York to ship American teenagers to wage war in Cuba . Did they figure there were not enough Cubans willing to fight for liberty ? The thin adolescent had sickly white skin , brownish hair , and an unlined , beardless face . Well , he was a lucky son of a gun , Battle thought . Not ever had he heard about anyone surviving an execution by firing squad . <p> The thirty-one-year-old lean and fair-headed Cuban stood five seven , sported a reddish beard , and was wearing reasonably clean civilian clothes . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English never tired of teasing the captain about the inappropriateness of his last name . A peace-loving family man and patriot , Battle had taken up arms seven months earlier and greatly missed his wife and two daughters . <p> What was pretentiously called " the infirmary " consisted of a fairly new bohfo . Its walls were made up of dry yaguas  --  the name given the fibrous tissue atop royal palms  --  superimposed and tied to a structure of branches and twigs set crosswise ; the roof was a sloping frame covered with dry pencas  --  palm fronds . Sunlight was coming in through the openings that served as door and window and through spaces between the walls and the roof . <p> Three coarse-cloth hammocks were suspended from hardwood posts whose ends rested on thick , eight-foot-long , Y-shaped branches of majagua that had been driven into a packed-earth floor from which sprouted short stumps of recently cleared undergrowth . Reeve had been assigned the left hammock . Next to him , a sergeant with a chest bullet wound seemed to be at death 's door ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblivious of their surroundings . Battle disliked waking up a wounded man , but Figueredo wanted to find out everything concerning the youngster . <p> According to Oropesa , the male nurse who had sewn up Reeve , the lad 's wounds were not serious ; in a couple of weeks , he 'd be moving around , as good as new in a month or so . But he had lost much blood , Oropesa had said ; the unnatural paleness of Reeve 's face confirmed this . Battle sighed and tapped the patient on the shoulder . The young man opened his eyes . <p> " Hello , how are you feeling ? " Battle asked . <p> Reeve frowned . " Hello yourself , sir . You speak English ? " <p> " I do . " <p> " My goodness ! I 'm feeling much better , thank you . Are you American ? " <p> " No , I 'm Cuban . " <p> " Dead earnest ? " <p> " Deadwood earnest . " <p> Henry Reeve chuckled for the first time in days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " University of Virginia . " <p> Taken aback by the officer 's educational credentials , Reeve tried to stand up , grimaced in pain , then lay down again . <p> " There 's no need for you to get up , " Battle said . " Take it easy . " <p> Reeve nodded . " What time is it ? " <p> From his waistline watch pocket Battle extracted a Vacheron Constantin , opened its lid , and glanced at the dial . " Five minutes to three , " he said , then restored the timepiece to its place . <p> " Sakes alive ! I 've been sleeping since lunchtime . Are you a surgeon , sir ? " Reeve asked . <p> " No , I 'm a civil engineer . But I 'm the only one around here who speaks English , and Brigadier General Figueredo  --  he 's the regional commanding officer  --  asked me to find out who you are , how you came to Cuba , where you were wounded , and so forth and so on . You reckon you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gladly , sir . " <p> Battle extracted a notebook and a pencil . " Very good . What 's your name ? " <p> " Henry Reeve . " <p> " Double e , v , e ? " <p> " Exactly , sir . " <p> " How old are you ? " <p> " Nineteen . " <p> Battle frowned and stared at the patient . " You look between hay and grass , " he observed . <p> " I know . But I 'm nineteen , honest . " <p> " Where are you from ? " <p> " Flatlands  --  that 's in Brooklyn , New York . " <p> Battle wrote that down , too . " All right . How did you end up in Cuba ? " <p> Reeve heaved a deep sigh and stared at the brownish vegetal ceiling , considering where to begin , then moved his eyes back to Battle . " Well , sir , at my place of work  --  a branch of the bank in Manhattan ; I was a bookkeeper  --  I befriended two young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by , we got to talking about Cuba . I had no idea Cuba existed , never heard of it . Federico and Ricardo told me that Cuban patriots had tried , by peaceful means , to make the Spanish government understand Cuba wanted to be free but that the Spaniards did n't want to let go . They said that a few months earlier , Spanish volunteers had killed Cubans outside a Havana theater . . . Vi something . " <p> " Teatro Villanueva . " <p> " Yeah , sounds familiar . They also said the only way to gain self-government was to wage war . One evening , they told me they were getting ready to join an expedition that would sail to Cuba . I thought that was a very brave thing to do and I said , ' Looky here , I want to go with you ; I want to fight for Cuba Libre . " <p> " Just like that . " <p> " Well , yes , just like that . You see , our Civil War ended before I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should put this ? . . . " <p> " Go to war ? Any war ? " <p> " No , sir , not any war . A war of independence , a war to end slavery . " <p> " I see . So , how did these Cubans react when you said you wanted to fight for Cuba Libre ? " <p> " Well , in the beginning they thought I did n't mean it . They warned me that the Spaniards outnumbered the insurgents and were better armed , that rebels were n't paid a penny , that I would n't eat the meals I was used to . I said I did n't mind all that . As time went by , I kept insisting , so they took me to a meeting of the Cuban revolutionary junta at Delmonico 's . <p> That 's a Manhattan restaurant on  --  " <p> " Beaver Street . I 've been there . Go on . " <p> " You 've been to New York ? " <p> " Yes , I have . Listen , lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on end , but you 've lost a lot of blood . You need to rest . Let 's try to . . . stick to the point . We 'll chat when you get well . So , go on . What happened at Delmonico 's ? " <p> " I was introduced to other young Cubans , but not to the older men , the leaders : Mr. Cisneros , Mr. Morales , and Mr. Aldama . I had n't heard about General Jordan until that night . But he was American , so I approached him when the meeting ended and said I wanted to volunteer . He said I was too young . I begged , said he would n't regret it . In the end , he accepted me as errand boy . I took letters from Brooklyn to Manhattan and back so many times , I got to know hands on the ferries on a first-name basis . By and by , I came to be his adjunct . I begged him to let me join the expedition that sailed in the Mary Lowell last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The British intercepted that ship in the Bahamas and turned it over to the Spaniards . Then preparations for the Perrit expedition got under way . I tried hard to become indispensable . . . . " <p> Half an hour later , inside a smaller bohfo , Captain Battle was making an oral report to Brig . Gen. Luis Figueredo . They sat in taburetes , rustic chairs with backs and seats of goatskin ; between them stood a small three-legged stool that had two gourds containing dregs of coffee and a snuffed tallow dip smeared with tallow drippings . A hammock was suspended at the back of the hut . In a corner , on the packed-earth floor , a horse 's harness rested on sackcloth . Clean garments on wooden hangers hung from a string . A bluish haze from cigar smoke pervaded the hut . Every once in awhile , Figueredo spat a stream of brown saliva on the ground . <p> A self-made , semiliterate , courageous man with a short temper and a large fortune , the forty-four-year-old general reckoned he owned around seven thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Believing that nearly all Spanish cattle ranchers would be selling off their herds and going back to their homeland once Cuba achieved sovereignty , he had taken up arms in mid-November 1868 , six weeks after other well-to-do Cubans of the Eastern Department had freed their slaves and declared war on the metropolis . Despite his strong profit motive , Figueredo loved good fights , and for him war was just a multitudinous brawl . As a rule , he practiced what he preached and used to lead into combat his hundred-horse men squadron . Deeply religious , he believed he would die when and where and how God wished . Should it be the Lord 's will to make him the richest cattleman in Cuba , no Spanish bullet would be standing in His way . <p> " Maybe General Jordan judged him a born adventurer with a romantic streak , appointed him his adjunct , and let him sail in the Perrit , " Battle said , concluding his report . " He says he lost his gun and was captured at Las Calabazas . All the prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found eleven bodies . Ten Cubans and one American , as the lad said . It 's a miracle . " <p> " Miracle it is , " Figueredo said , then spat . " Ten to one he shit in his pants , threw away his gun , ran for cover , and was captured . I do n't believe he 's nineteen ; he 's just a shaver . Well , I hope he gets well . I 'll make a man out of him . I 've got younger soldiers . And you know what ? I 'd enjoy having a Yankee subordinate , rather than getting ordered around by this General Jordan . Why did Cisneros sign him up ? I hate taking orders from foreigners . I know the terrain ; Jordan does n't . I do n't need anybody to show me how to fight the Spaniards . " <p> Battle believed Figueredo dead wrong , but he thought it unwise to say so . Most Cuban insurgents had little , if any , knowledge of military strategy and tactics ; they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , political ideas , and personal wealth , not combat experience . <p> " I do n't reckon the junta recruited anyone to teach us how to fight , " Battle said instead . " Some experienced American officers volunteered to lend us a hand and Cisneros accepted their offer . Jordan is a professional soldier . He resigned from the Union army , joined the Confederate army as a lieutenant colonel , and made brigadier general . He could be very useful . " <p> " The Confederacy lost . And you do n't appoint a foreigner chief of staff , " countered Figueredo . " Maybe Cisneros wants to annex Cuba to the United States ; having an American general leading the insurrection would facilitate that . " <p> " Maybe , " Battle said soothingly . " But most of us stand for nothing else than full independence . However , a number of our high-ranking officers are foreigners . Ryan is Canadian ; G=mez is Dominican ; Incln is Mexican ; Castillo is Colombian  --  " <p> " No Cuban I know wants Cuba to be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Figueredo said , waving aside Battle 's observation . " Yet , I know many who want Cuba to become part of the so-called United States . Pretty disunited , you ask me . " <p> " Yeah , I know some Cubans want that . They believe the colonies fought hard against the British , gained autonomy , drafted and enacted a great constitution  --  " <p> " I know . Spare me the history lesson . You graduated from an American university , right ? <p> " Right . " <p> " Are you an annexationist ? " <p> " I am not . " <p> " Oh , no ? " <p> " No . " <p> Pleasingly surprised , Figueredo closed his smile around the wet , chewed end of his stogie , took a drag , blew the smoke out , and spat on the floor . <p> " How come ? " <p> While pondering the best way to explain his rationale to the uncultured general , Battle lifted his gourd , sipped the last drop of coffee , and placed the receptacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared out the window , then locked gazes with his commanding officer . <p> " Once we beat the Spaniards , I believe we should adopt a democracy . I do n't want a king here , or a dictator , which is what the French have ended up with . Emperor Napoleon suppressed the greatest revolution ever ; now it 's Napoleon III . That 's not what I want for my country . I want Cubans to elect their president and senators and representatives , three branches of government , in de pen dent judiciary , a free press , the end of slavery  --  in three words , the American model . But I want our own government , our own laws , because we are a different people with a different culture , different language , and different values . " <p> " Makes me glad to learn that , " Figueredo said . " We 've been together for . . . how long ? " <p> " Two months . " <p> " And have never sat and talked politics . I thought that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an annexationist . " <p> " Well , now you know , sir . " <p> " Yeah . Let 's move on . Jordan is in Jiguanf , with Donato Mrmol 's troops . The rumor is he will look for greener pastures in Camagney . How will Jordan haul twenty-four-inch bronze cannons fifty leagues across the jungle ? I have n't got a clue . But you say he 's an experienced Confederate general . Well , the good news is that the Perrit brought thousands of guns and tons of ammunition , and I want to get some for me and my men before it all goes to Camagney . Take ten men and five burros , go see General Mrmol , and ask him to send me fifty Springfield rifles , ten revolvers for noncoms , and ammunition to boot . How soon can you leave ? " <p> " Is tomorrow morning acceptable to you , sir ? " <p> " Perfect . Send in my adjunct . I 'll dictate the letter you 'll take to General Mrmol . See you later . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Reeve approached the captain 's sixteen-hand palomino charger . The captain seized the rope that tethered the horse to a tree . The animal lifted his head , twitched his mane , and waved his tail . He had no tack on , and the rope was long enough to allow him to eat grass within a ten-foot radius . <p> " Meet my best friend , Henry , " Battle said to the young American . " He does n't argue with me , does what I order him to do , is not aware that a bullet may kill him , and unhesitatingly gallops into combat . He wo n't accidentally shoot me in the back , as some of my partners in this outfit could ; I do n't pay him a wage and he gets to cover a mare only when I let him . But I take good care of him . Oh yes . I care for him like I care for family . If you are serious about fighting for Cuba Libre , you 'll need a horse , so you 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " <p> For three consecutive mornings Reeve had felt well enough to wander around the base camp , shake hands with dozens of insurgents , learn words in Spanish , and smile when others laughed  --  albeit he had no clue what caused their hilarity . His gaze kept being drawn to wives and concubines of rebels , the women having followed their men 's footsteps and encamped there , some with their offspring , too . They made campfires with top-quality hardwood , which released fragrant smoke , to cook for their families . On sunny days , wet clothes hung from clotheslines . Reeve was getting accustomed to the high humidity and temperature , the daily schedule , the smells and the sounds . He patted the heads of tame dogs , watched species of birds , butter-flies , and beetles unknown to him , marveled at jutfas  --  the big rodents that lived on trees and fed on fruits . Having already sampled mango , guava , red mamey , and cherimoya , Reeve regarded jutfas as the connoisseurs of the woods . <p> That morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reeve had acknowledged he knew next to nothing concerning horses . Then Battle had walked him to one of the four clearings where equines and two cows were kept . <p> " Shoulder , forearm , knee , " Battle said , tapping the front left leg of his horse . He forced it up and bent it back ; the horse snorted . " This is the hoof , casco in Spanish . This is the shoe , herradura in Spanish . The timely and proper shoeing of a horse is extremely important . In normal times , finding a good farrier is of the essence . In war time , it 's even more important . The general has forbidden our farrier to join in battle . Repeat after me : casco , herradura , " he said , his finger moving from the hoof to the shoe . <p> " Casco , herradura . " <p> " Very good . " <p> Battle released the leg of his horse , reached for the rope , and patted the animal 's neck . <p> " Horses are not dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , according to how you treat them . So , it 's important to treat them well . I wear spurs constantly ; see if you find spur marks on his flanks . " <p> Reeve leaned forward and peered . " No . " <p> " It 's because I trained him to respond to the pressure of my calves and boots . If he does n't respond to that , you spur him gently , trying not to harm him . Understand ? " <p> " I . . . reckon so , yeah . " <p> " The best horse for you is the one you broke , meaning you trained him when he was a colt or a young mare . We do n't ride mares into combat , though . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " Well , primarily on account of the fact that they perpetuate the species . A slew of horses die in combat . But apart from that , mares fear gunfire more than stallions ; they shy when it comes to combat and charges . Mares are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are gentler than we are . " <p> " Yeah . Females are n't violent or destructive . Makes you wonder . But we 're talking horses . You get to know the animal and the animal gets to know you , too . He knows if you are angry , happy , sad ; he knows if you 've made love or taken a bath . It 's their sense of smell , I suppose . But you wo n't have time for that . You 'll get a horse trained by someone else . Just make sure you do n't get one that 's crow bait . " <p> " Crow bait ? " <p> " Lousy horse . Penco in Spanish . Now , a horse needs grooming . You free him of ticks , lice , and botflies . The stomach of a horse is delicate , and parasites do him great harm ; that 's why you have to have him wormed periodically  --  remind me to give you the recipe of the purgative I use . Brush him every time you get a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby . After a strenuous ride , you cool him down . " <p> " What do you mean , ' cool him down ' ? " <p> " You dismount , take off the saddle , the bridle , the bit , and walk him for a couple of minutes . You pat him , talk to him , let him know he 's done a good job and the day is over . Then you tie him up . " <p> " I see . " <p> " Now , observe his ears . How are they ?
