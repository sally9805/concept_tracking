Prologue They say the first of my kind was a woman named Alasdair , a human raised by hawks . She learned the language of the birds and was gifted with their form . It is a pretty myth , I admit , but few actually believe it . No record remains of her life . No record except for the feathers in every avian 's hair , even when otherwise we appear human , and the wings I can grow when I chooseand of course the beautiful golden hawk 's form that is as natural to me as the legs and arms I wear normally . This myth is one of the stories we hear as children , but it says nothing of reality or the hard lessons we are taught later . Almost before a child of my kind learns to fly , she learns to hate . She learns of war . She learns of the race that calls itself the serpiente . She learns that they are untrustworthy , that they are liars and loyal to no one . She learns to fear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably never see them . What she never learns is how the fighting began . No , that has been forgotten . Instead she learns that they murdered her family and loved ones . She learns that these enemies are evil , that their ways are not hers and that they would kill her if they could . That is all she learns . This is all I have learned . Days and weeks and years , and all I know is bloodshed . I hum the songs my mother once sang to me and wish for the peace they promise . It 's a peace my mother has never known , nor her mother before her . How many generations ? How many of our soldiers fallen ? And why ? Meaningless hatred : the hatred of an enemy without a face . No one knows why we fight ; theyonly know that we will continue until we win a war it is too late to win , until we have avenged too many dead to avenge , until no one can remember peace anymore , even in songs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night . Days and weeks and years . How long until their assassins find me ? Danica Shardae Heir to the Tuuli Thea I took a deep breath to steady my nerves and narrowly avoided retching from the sharp , well-known stench that surrounded me . The smell of hot avian blood spattered on the stones , and cool serpiente blood that seemed ready to dissolve the skin off my hands if I touched it . The smell of burned hair and feathers and skin of the dead smoldered in the fire of a dropped lantern . Only the fall of rain all the night before had kept that fire from spreading through the clearing to the woods . From the forest to my left , I heard the desperate , strangled cry of a man in pain . I started to move toward the sound , but when I took a step through the trees in his direction , I came upon a sight that made my knees buckle , my breath freezing as I fell to the familiar body . Golden hair , so like my own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now but so clear in my mind . His skin was gray in the morning light , covered with a light spray of dew . My younger brother , my only brother , was dead . Like our sister and our father years ago , like our aunts and uncles and too many friends , Xavier Shardae was forever grounded . I stared at his still form , willing him to take a breath and open eyes whose color would mirror my own . I willed myself to wake up from this nightmare . I could not be the last . The last child of Nacola Shardae , who was all the family I had left now . I wanted to scream and weep , but a hawk does not cry , especially here on the battlefield , in the midst of the dead and surrounded only by her guards . She does not scream or beat the ground and curse the sky . Among my kind , tears were considered a disgrace to the dead and shame among the living . Avian reserve . It kept the heart from breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war no one could win . It kept me standing when I had nothing to stand for but bloodshed . I could not cry for my brother , though I wanted to . I pushed the sounds away , forcing my lips not to tremble . Only one heavy breath escaped me , wanting to be a sigh . I lifted my dry eyes to the guards who stood about me protectively in the woods . " Take him home , " I ordered , my voice wavering a bit despite my resolve . " Shardae , you should come home , too . " I turned to Andreios , the captain of the most elite flight in the avian army , and took in the worried expression in his soft brown eyes . The crow had been my friend for years before he had been my guard , and I began to nod assent to his words . Another cry from the woods made me freeze . I started toward it , but Andreios caught my arm just above the elbow . " Not that one , milady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not here on the battlefield . I had been walking these bloody fields whenever I could ever since I was twelve ; I could not avert my eyes when we were in the middle of this chaos and someone was pleading , with what was probably his last breath , for help . " And why not , Andreios ? " The crow knew he was in trouble the instant I addressed him by his full name instead of his childhood nickname of Rei , but he kept on my heels as I stepped around the slain bodies and closer to the voice . The rest of his flight fell back , out of sight in their second forms -- crows and ravens , mostly . They would take my brother home only when it did not mean leaving me alone here . " Dani . " In return , I knew Rei was serious when he lapsed into the informal and used my nickname , Dani , instead of a respectful title or my surname , Shardae . Even when we were alone , Rei rarely called me Danica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used that nickname where someone else could hear it , and so I paused to listen . " That 's Gregory Cobriana . You do n't want his blood on your hands . "
