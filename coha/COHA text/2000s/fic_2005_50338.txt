They had no contract . It would be a simple transaction . A sublet in Tribeca for the month of September . Two bedrooms and a terrace : $3,000 . <p> They were almost forty years old , children of responsible , middle-class parents , and had created this mess out of their own sordid desires . Josh and Clarissa had lived for twelve years in a dingy brick high-rise in the Manhattan neighborhood of Tribeca . They had been lonely , met , married , worked at their art for years , presented their work to a world that was shockingly indifferent , floundered in debt , defaulted on student loans , began to lie to their parents about their financial status , and lived in a constant state of fear . They were afraid of what they might say when friends told them gleefully about their vacations ; they were afraid of opening another magazine to find another grad school colleague profiled and beautifully photographed , modest , bemused ; they were afraid of each other , disappointed that each could not rescue the other from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed at 5:30 in the morning , listening to their threeyear-old son , Sammy , hurtling toward the first sunbeam with the call : " More fun . More fun . " The wistful , hopeful cry made their blood go cold . One of them stumbled towards the relentless dawn , inevitably tripping over the trucks that Sammy had lined up in hopeful parades , as though he still had the conviction that there was somewhere wonderful to go . <p> Their rent-subsidized apartment was located in a dull seventies high-rise , where , at first , they braved the abandoned , crumbling warehouses and hefty rats for a rent so cheap they could not afford to live anywhere else . But then the neighborhood changed . They were on the strip of land known as Tribeca , their building a few blocks south of Canal , six blocks north of the World Trade Center , and now there were lofts selling for twenty million dollars , new restaurants with glossy , slim customers posed as though in liquor ads , movie star neighbors moving in such rarified circles they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they heard shrill hallway arguments about the misbehavior of companion animals , feuds about laundry hoisted prematurely out of the dryer . The residents were on edge because they were doomed ; the building would soon be privatized , rents hiked , and they would all end up on the street . Josh and Clarissa now skulked through their neighborhood with the cowed posture of trespassers . <p> Their son was almost three years old . Soon it would be time to send him to a preschool . In the park sandbox , mothers talked about Rainbows , the most expensive preschool in the area . Those who had been turned down or could not afford the school spoke of it with a strangled passion . One mother claimed she had stormed out when the director had asked to see her income tax statement during an interview . But another mother , whose son was a student there , leaned toward Clarissa one day after admiring Sammy 's exuberant personality , and said , " That 's the only place where they truly treat the children like human beings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rainbows to observe a class . The director , dressed in flowing , silk robes , and with large , lidded eyes that made her resemble a woodlands creature from a fairy tale , walked Clarissa through the airy rooms . The director said that the children particularly enjoyed " Medieval Studies , " which apparently meant that the children dressed up as kings and queens . Clarissa watched the children of successful lawyers , doctors , executives , and various moguls stack blocks , roll trucks , and cry . One child had tried to hand her a block . When she had smiled at him , a teacher gave her a laminated list of rules for class observation . Number 5 was : Do not engage with a child who tries to talk to you . It interferes with their work . She was ashamed that she had smiled at the child , and that shame convinced her that the school was the only place for Sammy to go . <p> " Ten thousand dollars , " said Josh , " so that he can scribble ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application , anyway-and when she received the acceptance she felt it was a sign of some greater good fortune . Their son gazed at them with his beautiful , pure brown eyes , his future gleaming , unsullied , new . <p> " At least visit the other schools , " pleaded Josh , and she tried . At one , she peered through a square window in a door to see a crowd of children screaming to be let out . One child punched in a security code , a red light flashed , the door opened , and he shot out , to the roaring approval of the others . That was it . They had enough room on their Visa for the first tuition installment ; they loaded it on . <p> Then Josh heard about a job for the two of them teaching art at a small university in Virginia , three weeks paid in September , accommodations for all of them in a hotel . They could hurl money toward Sammy 's tuition . Their apartment would be empty for a month . It occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their substantial debt load . " Let 's charge a fortune , " said Josh . <p> Josh 's college friend , Gary , an investment banker , delivered the subletter to them . " I think you can get three thousand , " he said . Their rent was five hundred and fifty a month . Josh wrote the ad : Fabulous Tribeca apartment . Two bedrooms , terrace . Three thousand for September . Gary sent his friends a mass e-mail , and the call came the next day . <p> " My name is Kim . Gary gave me your name . He says you have apartment to let . I live in Montreal , and I am looking for accommodations in the city for September . " <p> " Right , " Clarissa said . " Thanks for calling . Well , we 're by the Hudson , beautiful views , wood floors ... uh ... we have a dishwasher . " She paused . " Down the block , " she said carefully , " is Nobu . " <p> " No-bu , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've known Gary for three years , " Kim said . " We met in the south of France with his friends Janna from Paris and Juan from Brazil ... we were in town for the day for the Beaujolais festival . We became friends . Now we follow the Michelin guide all over Europe together . We have a race to see who has the most frequent flyer miles ... I have 67,000 but he has more . " She paused . " I want to go to Nobu . I want to go with my friend Darla . She is my best friend . I want to walk there ! " <p> " Now , it 's not fancy , " Clarissa said , alarmed . <p> " I want to walk to Montrachet ! " <p> Kim wanted to send the money immediately ; she magically wired $3,000 into their checking account , and that was that . <p> It was September 1 . Kim held the keys to their apartment . They checked their ATM as they headed out of town . The three thousand dollars registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They drove toward a month 's employment , a couple in front , a child in the car seat , across the bridges , out of the city . She and Josh held hands . Clarissa turned once to look back at the city , the skyline rising , glittering , frozen and grand in the clear autumn light . <p> She had dropped Josh off to look at televisions at a department store when she heard the news on the car radio . Her body startled . Howard Stern 's show came on the air , and the tone of the hosts was terrifying : lost and humorless . " We know who did it , " said a caller , " and we need to go kill them . " <p> Her hands were trembling so it was difficult to grip the wheel . She raced to the store , where the staff and customers had abandoned their personas and stood , statues , in front of the television screens . <p> She stood with the group in the electronics section , in front of dozens of screens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower buckled on the screen in front of them , frail as a sandcastle . Grown men around her yelled , No ! in shocked , womanly voices . Sammy was immediately attracted to the picture . " Booming sound , " said their son . She let him watch . " Booming ! " he yelled . <p> The fact that they lived by the Trade Center made them objects of concern . " I 'm so sorry , " said strangers . They stood , awkward , marked with an awful , bewildering luck . " Where would you have been ? " asked someone eagerly , as though they had been potential victims and they craved an intimacy with the disaster . " We would have been one block away , " Clarissa said . Her arms became cold . This admission felt strangely like bragging . It occurred to her that others thought that they could have been dead . Around nine o'clock they would have been steps away , bringing Sammy to his first day of school . <p> The chair of the art department told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the hotel . It was stale and hot , full of a thousand strangers ' breaths . She was not supposed to be here , and did not know what to do with herself , grubby , ashamed , alive . She felt fat and sickened by her own flesh . The TV droned casualty estimates into the room . The curtains were drawn , and the room was dark . They tried all day to get Sammy to nap . He popped out of his room , awake , excited by their fear . He imitated them , shouting into the phone . " Hello ! " he called gaily . " Hello . " <p> Somehow , the day ended . They drove down the dark streets , Sammy screaming with exhaustion , until he fell asleep . A student had said to them : Providence had brought them here . " You have been blessed , " the student said in a respectful tone , before inviting them to church . Clarissa declined , though she kept thinking about this . She asked Josh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're not special , " he said . " Do n't feel special . It could be us next time . It could be us any minute . " <p> She looked out the window . This was not the answer she wanted . " Why do you say that ? " she said . " How do you wake up in the morning ? How are you going to walk Sammy across the street- " <p> He reached for her hand . They were ridiculous with unexpected luck . His fingers felt strange , rubbery ; she clung to them , bewildered by the raw facts of their fingers , their hair . <p> " Hello , " said the voice , aggrieved , three days later . " Hello , Clarissa . It 's me . " <p> " Hello ? " asked Clarissa . " Who is this ? " <p> " I was on my way there . I wanted to go to the observation deck . I went the wrong way on the subway , or I would be dead . I got out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the second plane . I started running , and then I could n't get the windows closed because I 've never seen windows like yours- " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Clarissa whispered , " I 'm sorry- " <p> " They said there 's a bomb under the George Washington Bridge ! " Kim shouted . " I ca n't get the ferry to New Jersey , it 's closed . Is there a heliport in Manhattan ? I 'll pay anything to get to a heliport . Can you tell me ? " <p> " I do n't know , " said Clarissa . " I do n't know where one is- " <p> There was a pause . " I 'm leaving town , " said Kim . " I ca n't stay here . And I want a refund . I want it all back . " <p> One day before they left Virginia to return to New York , Clarissa received an e-mail : IN REGARDS TO REFUND <p> I have not heard from you in regards to the status of my refund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . All the hotels are giving refunds . Also free rooms in the future , suite upgrades . My pet peeves are injustice and dishonesty . I know when I am being treated fairly . You did not tell me certain facts about the apartment , which was , I am sorry to say , filthy . Black goo all over the refrigerator . I had to wear plastic gloves to keep my hands clean . <p> Darla and I planned our vacation for a long time . We are best friends . We were going to buy the same clothes , go to the newest restaurants . People would admire us and say who are those glamour girls . Her hair is red and more beautiful , but I will admit I have nicer legs , we wanted to start a commotion . <p> I expect to receive payment of US$3000 within a week . <p> When they got out of their cab at Canal Street , the border between civilian New York and the war zone , they unloaded their luggage by the rows of blue police barricades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state trooper , standing , trim and noble in his brown uniform , surrounded by pans of homemade cookies . " Do you live here , or do you have reservations ? " <p> They looked at him . <p> " The restaurants gave us lists of people who have reservations , " he said , pulling out a piece of paper . They offered their driver 's license , and the officer agreed : this was where they lived . <p> He offered to give them a ride to their building . The car floated by the gray , scrolled buildings , the streets deserted as though the neighborhood had simply been a stage set , built quickly , then abandoned . The sky had become a pale , sickly orange and gray . There were too many police cars posed at corners ; sirens pierced the warm air . There were American flags everywhere , as though everyone was desperate to have the same thought . People hurried down the streets , carrying groceries , pushing strollers ; some were wearing surgical masks . She was suddenly leaden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity . <p> Kim had left in great haste , sheets piled in the living room , a pale lipstick in the bathroom sink . Clarissa picked up the lipstick and touched the tip ; the color was an unearthly pink . Sammy ran ahead of them . She thought that they should make some grand entrance , that they should say something profound to each other , but she merely listened to their presence ring through the apartment ; the sound was perplexingly beautiful . <p> They were home . There was the smell , unlike anything she had smelled before . Burning concrete and computers and office carpets and jets and steel girders and people . There was nothing natural about the smell , it tasted bitter and metal in her mouth , and blew through their neighborhood at variable times ; the mornings began , sweet and deceptive , the afternoons became heavy with it . She began to get a sore throat , and her tongue became numb . The girls at the American Lung Association table gave her a white paper mask and told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her windows closed and stay inside . She walked against the small stream of people wearing paper masks . The streets were dark and shiny , the sanitation trucks spraying down the street to keep the dust from lifting into the air . A man walked the streets in a suit and a gas mask . Did he know something they did not ? Where did he get the gas mask ? People used to strut in their neighborhood , but now everyone was simply moving forward , in dull impersonations of themselves . <p> She went out to the market the first morning after they returned . She pushed Sammy in his stroller downtown , heading straight toward the empty sky . In the market , she picked out cereal , detergent , apples to the pop soundtrack in the supermarket , the cheerful music that usually made her feel as though she were part of some drama greater than herself . Now it floated around her , impossible , but the supermarket did not shut it off . <p> When she ran into neighbors , anyone : Modesto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bodega , mothers from the playground , she moved toward them , the fact of their existence , her fingers like talons . It did not matter that she did not know their names . How are you , they asked each other , and it seemed like they were saying I love you . <p> " How are you ? " Modesto asked . <p> " Where were you ? " she asked . <p> " How is your apartment ? " <p> " I 'm glad to see you . " <p> The meetings were hushed and tender , and then , with further discussion , she found that the neighbors had become deformed by a part of their personalities . The mothers who had been angry now were enormous , stiff-shouldered with anger , the mothers who were fearful were feathery , barely rooted to the ground . " Why do they close the park for asbestos , " said one angrily , " when before it was just full of piss and shit . " <p> She stood with Josh , that first week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks taking the rubble to the barge . They sat , sweaty , greasy , in their living room , listening to the crash of the crumbled buildings as they fell into the steel barge . The swerve of the cranes sounded like huge , screaming cats , and when the heavy debris crashed into the barge , the sound was so loud they could feel it in their jaws . <p> They drifted quickly from their damp new gratitude for their lives to the fact that they had to live them . One week after their return , they sat beside the pile of bills that had accumulated . They sat before the pile as though before a dozen accusations ; then Josh got up from the pile of bills that they could not pay . He went to his closet and brought out suits that she had not seen since he was in his twenties . She was startled when she saw him , the same slim figure , but now with gray hair . This sudden aging seemed a terrible betrayal . Suddenly , she realized that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She dragged out some of the dresses she had worn fifteen years ago : stretchy Lycra dresses that clung to her skin . Now she looked like a sausage exploding from its casing . She had been hostage to the absurd notion that by acting young , you will not age . The part-time jobs , the haphazard routine , had kept them mired in a state of hope , preserved at the crest of some wonderful transformation . <p> " We were fools , " he said . <p> Clarissa looked at herself in the mirror . She tried to hold her stomach in . <p> " We have to get real jobs . We should have had them fifteen years ago . What are we doing ? " <p> " What about your art ? " she asked . " We can cut back . We can eat beans more . " He stared at her . " We can get another gallery , you 're doing great work- " <p> She hated the tinny , rotting optimism in her voice . It had pushed them forward blindly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen for who they really were . She had wanted to walk through museums to see her work displayed on the walls . That sort of presence would , she had thought , cure her sorrow for her own death . But of course , it would not . <p> " We were idiots , " he said . <p> They looked out the window at the smoke rising . His eyelashes were dark and beautiful . She remembered how when she married him , she hoped that their children would have those eyelashes , believed that loveliness would be protection against some cruelty . She rubbed her face , which was damp with sweat . Her mind seemed to have stopped . There was a short pause outside ; the crane operators stopped for a moment of silence whenever they found part of a body . She looked out and saw one of the workers holding his hat . She opened one of the windows . The sickening , metallic smell entered the apartment . <p> " Kim wants all her money back , " she said . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it back , " she said . " Of course I would . But the way she yelled at me , and how she said this place was dirty where I know it was clean- " <p> " How can we pay her ? " he laughed bitterly . " We ca n't pay anyone . " <p> Dear Kim : <p> We are so sorry for your terrible experience . We are so glad you were not harmed . This is indeed a terrible time for the world . You did stay in our apartment for ten nights , and I have calculated this stay , at current hotel rates , at $150 a night . We are also deducting a fee for cleaning the apartment , as you did leave a window open letting some contaminated dust inside . This leaves you with a refund of $1,000 . The first installment of this , in $20 , will arrive in a week . Peace be with you . <p> She took a deep breath and pressed " Send . " <p> She took Sammy to his first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taped fliers . The local day spa was offering free massages for firemen and policemen . A neighborhood restaurant offered a $25 Prix Fixe , Macaroni and Roast Beef , Eat American . Donations to Ladder 8 for Missing Fireman accepted . Dozens of Xeroxed faces of the missing clung to lampposts , wrapped with tape ; they stared into the street . Loving husband and father . Our dear daughter . Worked on the 87th floor . Worked at Windows on the World . Please call . She walked by them slowly , and suddenly she could not breathe . The missing people were on every corner . They were smiling and happy in the photos , and many were younger than her . <p> The preschool was a block north of the wooden blue police barricades that separated regular life from the crumbled heap of buildings , the endless black smoke . Her stroller rattled past them and through the doors of the preschool . The school staff floated around , greeting everyone , with an unnerving intimacy , by their first names . Sammy darted into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had walked to school under the smoky , foul skies , wearing leather coats in blue and orange . It seemed a paltry , mean decision , deciding what to wear , waking up and hearing the broken buildings falling into the boats . They had decided to dress up . Their hair was frosted golden and brown , and they were beautiful , and when they left , they cupped hands over their mouths . <p> " Have you gone out to dinner yet ? " she heard one mother ask another . " You would n't believe the good deals down here , plus you can get reservations . Prix fixe at Chanterelle , thirty-five bucks , incredible , plus you have money for a good bottle of wine . " <p> " The Independence has a special , Eat American , " said another . " The wait staff is fast and gracious . They have the most exquisite apple pie . " <p> Clarissa closed her eyes and rubbed her face , wondering whether she should admire these mothers ' resilience or be appalled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard another mother say . " They had a special for everyone living below Canal . We had to go . They were generous . Our place was covered in that dust . We started throwing up , and I knew we had to get out . It cost a ton to get it cleaned . Should we stay or go ? Can someone just tell me ? " She whirled around , looking . <p> The teacher came over . " The children are doing well , " he said . " Do you want to say bye before you go ? " <p> Now Clarissa swerved through the room like a drunken person . Your child was not in the world , and then he was , suddenly , part of it . She crouched and breathed his clean , heartbreaking smell . " I 'm going bye , " she said . <p> Her child ignored her . Slowly , she stood up . <p> In the office off the main hallway , the in-house psychologist was holding a drop-in support session in which parents could talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks from the site . Clarissa stood with the group clustered around the psychologist . One mother said , " My child screamed the whole way here , saying she was scared and did n't want to go , and I dropped her off , but then , well , I wonder , is she right to be scared ? " <p> " Why is she right ? " asked the psychologist . <p> " Well , because , " called Clarissa , from the back . <p> " You have to believe it is safe , " said the psychologist . " You tell them a kid 's job is to go to school , and a parent 's job is to keep you safe . " <p> " But what if we do n't know if it 's safe ? " Clarissa asked . <p> " Where is it safe ? " the psychologist said . " Here ? Brooklyn ? Vermont ? Milwaukee ? " <p> The parents leaned toward her , awaiting an answer . <p> " You have to tell them a little lie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an e-mail with the heading : STUNNED . <p> I do n't know how you decided on this number as a refund . It is very unfair . Who are you to decide how much money to refund me ? You were lucky ; I was the one who suffered . I was on my way there ! <p> You did not tell me about the low water pressure or the scribbled crayon on the walls . Those facts would have made me not rent the apartment , and then I would NOT have been there . I thought you were my friend . Some friend . Do you even know what a friend is ? Darla , my best friend , is kind to everyone , especially kittens . She once went to the animal shelter and brought her old Gucci towels to make the kittens more comfortable . I could see the fat attendants eyeing them ! She told them to make sure the kittens took their towels with them to their new home . <p> You left oily hairs in your hairbrush . I have your hairbrush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . Who would put Maybelline on her eyelashes ? Who would look good in navy blue ? Are you trying to be younger than your age ? You do not look so youthful in the snapshots on your refrigerator . You dress as though you think you are . You should not wear jeans when you are in your late thirties . I do n't care if it is a bohemian sort of thing , it is just sad . <p> I am requesting $3000 plus $1000 for every nightmare I have had since the attack , which currently totals 24 . You owe me US$27000 , payable now . <p> Josh found a job as an illustrator at an advertising firm , and each morning , he sprinted down their hallway toward the office that gave him a new life . Sammy would not say goodbye without giving his father one of his toys to keep during the day . " Take one toy , " Sammy said , thrusting a tiny plastic dinosaur or little truck into the pocket of his father 's suit . Sammy could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember him , and when Josh finally had to leave , Sammy began to wail . He began to race after his father , and she had to grab him . " Daddy will be back , " she said in a strained , cooing voice . " We 'll see him later- " <p> He looked at her as though she were a fool . <p> One morning she tried to distract him by walking up to SoHo to see which artists had shows up . She peered at one , where one member of the staff had expressed interest in her work , but had then vanished in an abrupt , unexplained departure . Another young woman , perhaps ten feet tall , wearing the monochrome dark outfits all the gallery staff wore , came over . Sammy was butting his head against the doorway , like a small bull . <p> " I 'm sorry , but he ca n't come in , " she said . <p> Her face was perfectly blank , which Clarissa wanted to see as a personality deficiency , but was instead an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banged on this gallery 's door . Sammy lurched forward . The girl blocked the door . " Sorry , " she said , sounding strained , " ma'am- " <p> Clarissa grabbed Sammy . She bumped into the American flag that was hanging from the gallery 's door . <p> " God bless America , " said the girl , quickly . They loved all of America , but they were afraid of her . <p> " Come on , " she said to Sammy . " I 'll get you a ball . " <p> She bought him a small red ball , and they passed the local park where they had spent much of their time before the attack . It had been beautiful , children playing under large green trees , honeyed patches of sunlight . Now the plants in the garden had been flattened when people raced , terrified , out of the park . The park had been closed briefly to clean up asbestos contamination . Sammy hurled his new ball into the park and darted in , chortling with joy . His ball was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON OR AROUND THIS CONTAINER . On the trees were fliers : EPA IS LYING . TOXIC DUST EVERYWHERE . UNITE ! <p> " No ! " she yelled . " No more ball . " <p> She grabbed him by the waist and lifted him . He scratched her , leaving two red lines on her arms . He kicked . She struggled to find a way to hold him so that he would not hurt her , but he was wild . She wanted to scream at him , but instead whispered shut up into the air . She was not a good mother , she was afraid . " Come on , " she yelled , and swung him up on the shoulder . His scream vibrated through his Elmo shirt . She hated him for revealing to her what a terrible mother she was . She did not know how to protect him from the world . When he was older , he would not remember the Towers . She envied his ignorance , longed for it . <p> " Hey ! " someone called . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball for you , " she said . <p> " It was by that bin , you 're not supposed to touch it- " <p> The janitor looked at her . " You can just wipe it off . " She took a Kleenex from her pocket and wiped the ball . Clarissa wondered what sort of person would live with their child by a toxic zone , beside police barricades encircling targets of violence . She shuddered , for that sort of person was herself . <p> " That 's just where they keep the rat poison , " said the janitor , cheerfully . <p> " The rat poison , " said Clarissa , numbly . She had never thought the term rat poison would sound nostalgic , but she was strangely calmed . <p> Dear Clarissa : <p> You have forgotten about me . I have not forgotten about you . You were lucky . You were out of town . I had to endure your apartment . I can still feel the dirt on my skin . I can not believe that you keep a child in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing on the walls . Furthermore , his drawings do not even show any artistic merit . <p> This is a pathetic way for someone who is 38 to live . I figured it out . I have ten more years of life to live over you . Ha ha ! This is how I wanted to spend it : wake up , go to the top of the building , look out and take pictures with my new camera , come down , go to lunch at Nobu , walk around SoHo , buy something for my husband , go look at the shoes at Prada , have tea at the Plaza , jet off to Zermatt , stop in London . I want it all . I have the good taste to appreciate what is worthy in life . <p> My refund is us$29,000 , payable now . <p> Dear Kim : <p> Do n't try to pass the buck to me . You lived . You were lucky . Do you know what we were doing when you were here trying all the restaurants ? Working . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how many jobs I 've had in the last year , trying to make money and make time for my art ? Twelve . Do you know how close I came to getting a review in the Times ? The guy came and loved my work . The words he used were " ground-breaking . " Then along came this woman who videoed her own vagina and played the video to the soundtrack of The Sound of Music . There was room for just one review and she got it . It was a good one . <p> I am considering the refund and the appropriate amount considering the fact that we should all rise above ourselves during this terrible time . Peace be with you . <p> Each morning , when she walked Sammy into Rainbows , she felt first a sweet , exquisite rush of relief . Sammy jumped out of the stroller to a cream-colored room scented like oranges , inconceivably sweet . " Hello , Sammy , " the teachers said , as though he was a visiting dignitary . " Sammy 's here . Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this beautiful room , and waved at her , expecting her to walk out to continue her own life . She looked at the street , and she did not know where she could go . The hallway was mostly empty . She sat and watched the children play . <p> The mother who had been a refugee at the Plaza was heading a committee to raise money for tuition lost when parents withdrew their children . She was taking a poll in the hallway regarding how much to charge for the tickets . " I 'm thinking something spectacular . A French theme , " she told Clarissa . " Dinner , casino , a silent auction . Do you think people would pay fifty , one hundred , or two hundred per ticket ? " <p> " I would pay one thousand , " Clarissa said . <p> The woman looked right at her . It was as though Clarissa had told her something wonderful about herself . " Yes , " she said , softly . <p> Dear Clarissa : <p> It is not my concern that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me . It was your choice to pursue this " job " of artist . Why would I owe you anything ? You were not honest with me . Honesty is the best policy . When Darla left her husband , she told him that she could not stand his skinny legs . That was just something she felt he should know . We all have our tolerances . The knowledge might have helped him in his later dating life . You should have told me about the water pressure , scribbled crayon , hallway odor , broken TV , useless air conditioner . Why did n't you ? I expect US$31,000 payable now . <p> Dear Kim : <p> You idiot . You have been spared . Other people died who were nicer than you . Do you even know how to love ? <p> Dear Clarissa : <p> How dare you . I was there . You were not . I ran . I almost lost my life , so you have lost your right to harass me . How dare you ask if I can love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love good service in restaurants . I love people who bring me delicious things . I love the crme brle at the Four Seasons . I love the shoe salesgirl at Bendel 's . So you see I have a great ability for love . Maybe you could learn something about it . Love ! Love ! Love ! <p> You owe me US$31,000 , payable now . <p> There were no more e-mails . At night , Clarissa lay beside Josh , awake , listening to the wild screaming of the cranes . <p> On October 30 , she sat down and wrote a check for two hundred and sixty-three dollars and seventy-five cents . There was no reason for this amount except that it was what they had left in the bank account that month . She did not know what to write on the note , so she scribbled , quickly : Here is your refund . God Bless . <p> Halloween would be Sammy 's last day at the school . The bad tuition check for $2,000 had been sent a week before , and she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Sammy dressed as a lion . All the children were in costume . A few mothers were loitering in the lobby , captivated by the sight of their children pretending to be something else . Sammy 's class was populated with two miniature Annies , a Superman , a ballerina , three princesses , some indeterminate sparkly beings , a dog , and Sammy , the lion . The teacher read them a Halloween story , speaking to them as though she believed they would live forever . The children listened as though they believed this , too . Clarissa pressed her hands to the glass window that separated the parents from their children ; she wanted to fall into the classroom and join them . <p> After school , she wanted to buy Sammy a special treat . She bought him a blue helium balloon at a party store . He marched down the street , grinning ; she lumbered after him , this tiny being with a golden mane and tail . Suddenly , Sammy stopped and handed her the balloon . " Let it fly away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting you another , " she said . <p> " Let it fly away ! " he shouted . " Let it ! " <p> She took the balloon and released it . The wind pushed it roughly into the air . Her son laughed , an impossibly bright , flutelike sound . Other people stopped and watched the balloon jab into the air . They laughed at Sammy 's amusement , as though captivated by some tender memory of themselves . Then the balloon was gone . <p> " Where is it ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't know , " she said . <p> Her child looked at her . <p> " Get it , " he said . <p> A week later , she picked up the phone . " Two hundred and sixty-three ? How did you come up with this number ? You owe me $54,200 , why do n't you give me my money ? " <p> " Look ! " said Clarissa . " You went the wrong way on the subway . Why do you keep bothering us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You were n't where you were supposed to be . " <p> " You were n't , either , " said Clarissa . " You went the wrong way- " <p> " Maybe it was n't the wrong way . Maybe the Towers were the mistake . Why would I have wanted to go there , anyway ? Maybe I was supposed to meet someone there , and they never showed up . What do you think of that ? " <p> Clarissa felt cold . " Were you supposed to meet someone there ? " <p> " Would I get my $54,200 ? " <p> " Were you meeting someone there ? " asked Clarissa . " Were you ? " <p> " She is named Dark , " said Kim . <p> " Why did n't you say this ? " asked Clarissa . <p> " Will you pay me my money ? " <p> Clarissa 's throat felt hot . <p> " I was talking to her on my cellphone , " said Kim . " She was on the elevator to the observation deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Empire State Building , but I thought at the Towers we would get a better view . " <p> What did one owe for being alive ? What was the right way to breathe , to taste a strawberry , to love ? <p> " Kim , " said Clarissa , " I- " <p> " Do you know how long I 'm going to charge you ? " Kim said , her voice rising . <p> Clarissa closed her eyes . <p> " Do you know ? " asked Kim . <p>
