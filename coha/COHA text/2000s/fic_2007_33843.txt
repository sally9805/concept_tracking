The honeymoon was over . The sweet , quiet thirteen-year-old girl from last August had now , in May , morphed into a drama queen . In the evening , my phone rang constantly with calls from her friend , Nell , whom she 'd spent the entire day with at school . One would think they 'd talked over everything there , but evidently they still had important issues to discuss . Every weekend there was some event that required her attendance . And if she did n't go , she said she 'd die . For a thirty-something librarian who had lived a peaceful life , becoming a foster mother was a change that had left me reeling . I was in over my head . My beloved grandmother sat at her kitchen table and listened to my tale of woe with a small smile playing at the corner of her mouth . Her green eyes held a distinct twinkle . " You think this is funny , do n't you ? " I said , leaning up against the counter in Abby 's kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver hair back into the heavy braid coiled at the top of her head . In her seventies , her face bore the traces of the lovely young woman my grandfather had brought to Iowa all those years ago . And when she smiled , that young woman seemed to peek out . " Yes , I do . I can recall similar conversations I had with your mother when you were a teenager , " she said in a voice stillrich with the tempo of the Appalachian Mountains where she 'd spent her girlhood . I frowned . " Wait a second . I never spent hours on the phone every night after school . And most of my weekends were at the library , not running around some mall . " " That 's right . " She nodded . " You did spend most weekends studying , but I do recall one weekend at Halloween- " " Hey , that was n't my idea . Linda had a crush on the dean 's son . She wanted to get his attention . " Abby 's laugh rang out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the son 's attention , but the dean 's and the campus police . " I lowered my eyes and traced the toe of my shoe across the wooden floor of Abby 's rustic kitchen . The smell of wood smoke from her cook stove mingled with the scent of the dried herbs hanging from the open beams , as I remembered all too well the incident Abby was referring to . My girlfriend , Linda , thought she was madly in love with the dean 's son , but he would n't give her the time of day , so one Halloween we decided to change all that and decorate every bush and tree in his yard with toilet paper . The pristine white streamers looked lovely waving in the moonlight , or at least we thought so until the campus police rolled up the driveway and busted us . Not a good situation to be in when both your parents are professors and the dean is your mother 's boss . I think I got grounded for a month over that little escapade . Abby 's voice jarred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then there was the time you and Linda- " " Okay , okay , " I grumbled . " I get it . I put my mother through my share of drama , too . " She walked over to me and placed her hands on my shoulders . " It 's going to be all right , Ophelia . Kids do n't come with instruction manuals . All you can do is love them . " A frown puckered my forehead . " I do love Tink . She 's had a tough life for someone so young . Losing her mother at such a young age , then being forced to live with her psycho aunt for all those years . " A shudder ran through me as I thought of Juliet Finch , Tink 's aunt and former guardian . When we 'd met the Finches last summer , Juliet had been trying to use Tink 's talent as a medium for her own purposes . She tried to keep the kid drugged , and Tink 's only ally had been a Native American shaman , Walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state mental hospital in Minnesota . Her husband , Jason , had been more concerned about Juliet than Tink , and I knew we could give Tink the love and support she deserved . Jason willingly signed Tink 's custody over to me , and we 'd brought her back to Iowa . Abby picked up on my thoughts-a side effect of having a psychic grandmother . Her hands tightened on my shoulders in a comforting squeeze . " Do n't worry about Juliet . " A sigh slipped out and I stepped away from her hand . " But what if she wants Tink back someday ? " Abby crossed her arms over her worn flannel work shirt and gave me a hard stare . " Quit borrowing trouble , " she said in a stern voice . " Jason Finch signed legal custody over to you- " " Yeah , " I interrupted , " but Jason adores his wife and will do whatever Juliet wants . If she 's ever released and decides she wants Tink back , Jason would move heaven and earth to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , with a toss of her head . " The Finches ca n't give Tink a stable home . " " But Juliet is her only living relative , " I argued . She gave my shoulder a little shake . " You worry too much . " Chewing on my bottom lip , I shrugged . " I do n't know , Abby , lately I ca n't shake the feeling something 's up . " " Ophelia , " she said , her voice full of exasperation , " stop it . We may be psychic , but it does n't mean we see ' everything . The future will unfold as it should . And whatever happens , we 'll do our best to make sure Tink 's best interests are protected . " " What about now ? Am I doing what 's in Tink 's best interests ? " Abby gave me a questioning look . " What do you mean ? " " Am I giving her what she needs ? " " Do you mean her training ? " " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in your greenhouse after school , and I know you 've been coaching her . Is she gaining more control ? " " Hmm , " Abby pursed her lips and stared off into space . Nodding once , she looked back at me . " Yes , she is . Tink is a thirteen-year-old girl , so there are all those hormones beginning to bounce around . And she wants desperately to fit in with her new friends . " She paused . " But her focus and control is really amazing for someone so young . "
