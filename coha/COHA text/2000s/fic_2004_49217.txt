THE MASKED CITY NEVER sleeps . Her insomnias are contagious . <p> For six months I 've haunted her streets . Hundreds cross my path every day , forgetting me immediately . With my shoulderbag on my back and my commonplace clothes , I 'm taken for a tourist or a student . They do n't see me , but there are others on watch . Sometimes , on the canal banks , I could swear that I hear the splashing waves calling me by name . <p> Gioidano Salvaggio , the waters murmur . We have not forgotten , Giordano . <p> I 'm a poacher of a rather special kind , and Venice is my hunting ground . Six months is quite enough to secure a more-than-intimate rapport with a city . It 's sometimes sufficient merely to exchange a glance : draw out a single thread and the entire tapestry unravels between your fingers . But a city stripped naked is never beautiful to behold . <p> Sofia did n't have the time to understand . Sometimes I envy her that . <p> They make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it take to perceive the filth encrusted beneath the gilt and varnish of myth ? It 's the legend they come to admire , not the city . Scarcely time to fill a few rolls of film , to acquire a stock of anecdotes to recount at a later date , far away from here , with a nostalgic gleam in the eye . Once home again , the sickness induced by the sight of those polluted canals is forgotten - along with the walls , almost close enough to touch , that seem to be weighing one another up . Photographs have the virtue of effacing such things . <p> But for six months I 've lived with the dizziness of these arches and bridges , these towers and staircases , these yawning windows . I know her days , choked by desiccation , dust , and burning sunlight , and her evertranquil nights , and - above all else - her canals : open wounds in a compact mass held together by the thick sutures of the bridges . They 're my normality . <p> The canals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those waters : troubled and dirty . It 's a veritable syrup that flows through the city 's arteries . Do they ever ask themselves , all these visitors , how many corpses these waters have transported ? Because they 've inevitably done so , being such a convenient hiding place . A glacial coldness must hold sway at the very bottom , where the sunlight ca n't reach . More than one corpse must have finished up there without anyone knowing . I know of at least one that the waters have carried away . <p> I no longer dare examine those waters too closely , and have n't for some time . The distorting mirror of the Venetian canals confuses perspectives at its leisure . The medley of changing reflections no longer has anything in common with the outlines of the bridges and the facades - not to mention the faces that might conceive the absurd idea of admiring themselves therein . The waters amuse themselves by corrupting every image , doubtless to remind us that the entire city is nothing but a gigantic illusion . Not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesan decked out in silks and ribbons , but already corroded by the pox . She rots within , without ever giving up her brilliant smile . <p> I 'm not from here-and if there is one thing of which I 'll remain proud until the last , it 's that . <p> There are people like me that she fears , parasites of my species . The tourists she has always tolerated , doubtless amusing herself as much with their idiotic devotion as with their blindness . It is to them , after all , that she owes her legendary status , and a divinity would be nothing without a company of faithful followers . Venice has her labyrinthine sid - streets , her clouds of pigeons and her flow of tourists ; such is the natural order of things . <p> Near to the Piazza San Marco , I 've often come across a street urchin busy ripping off the tourists . Luca is ten years old , full of energy , with an innate gift for salesmanship - a mere fledgling in form , his shoulders lightly sunburnt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a tank top , sandals , and Bermuda shorts ; a gold bracelet advertising his forename ; a Santa Rita medal about his neck ; and the ancient scuffed satchel in which he carries his merchandise . <p> Ricordi di Venezia ! he cries , at the top of his voice . <p> He knows how to home in on the tourists and accost them at exactly the right moment , just as they 're posing for a souvenir photograph or feeding breadcrumbs to the pigeons . They 're recognizable by the particular expression with which they gaze at things , tinged with curiosity but already hollow . Luca knows how to overwhelm their attention with a deluge of words , until their wallets open by themselves , under the spell of some magic formula known only to himself . He accompanies his patter with the smile of a brave ragazzino , which he must have been practicing since he was a little child . <p> I had less innocent means of ripping off the tourists , but it was to sell them shoddy goods of a less ordinary kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops - wishywashy postcards , flags in the city 's colors , brightly colored imitation cameras whose viewfinders reveal a series of Venetian cliches - together with a harvest of homemade bracelets whose materials could n't have cost a tenth of the price he exacts for them . <p> Luca has nothing to fear ; he 's a native . I was similar in kind once , but I came from somewhere else . To live on the credulity of others is n't in itself such a great crime , but among the things that one learns to one 's cost is an essential rule : Never offend Venice . <p> Was Sofia the less culpable of the two of us , seeing that she was spared that lesson ? <p> We were living in a minuscule room at the top of a narrow staircase , whose only window let in soupy air that was just about breathable : a confined space in which two bodies could only coexist in a condition of intimacy . It was there that we 'd make plans for the future , which became ever more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year at most - just time enough to exhaust the vein before moving on toward an indefinable elsewhere . There had been other cities ; further ones awaited us . <p> Sofia rarely went out - only when it was necessary , when her materials ran out . Sitting cross-legged on the mattress that was our only furniture , she wove our traps as patiently as a spider . <p> She laughed when I gave her that nickname : ragno mio , my spider . In our private code , I was her hunter , Gioidano il Cacciatore . <p> She also had a spider 's agility . They were beautiful , her traps . At one time I had thought of selling them in the market , passing them off as pieces of tribal art . I would have got a good price for them . Sofia had an artist 's love for work well done , and very slender fingers , well-adapted for minutely detailed tasks . They would busy themselves fixing a lattice of colored threads to the frame , sometimes mixed with a few brown hairs - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw two of those traps that were alike . <p> She had elected to model her works on Native American dream-catchers , but I 'd never known whether the pearls , pebbles , and pigeon feathers that she integrated into her structures were mere ornaments or necessary ingredients . <p> It was the same with the hairs , as stout as those of a mare 's mane , which Sofia wore permanently braided into a thick plait draped over her shoulder . I sometimes found them in the four corners of the room , abandoned there as if they were carefully marking out her territory . The room belonged to her ; my own terrain was the streets of the citta . <p> The game amused her less than the time she passed adorning her traps , like a child painstakingly constructing collages . As for the money I brought back at the conclusion of my hunts , for Sofia the Spider it was only a means , not an end . She welcomed it gladly , insofar as it permitted her to weave more traps and prepare for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she did her best to help me with it . It was I who knew how to hide the traps under cover of wandering hands , and it was I who harvested our prizes at nightfall . It was also I who lulled the suspicions of our prey . <p> We complemented one another perfectly . <p> One evening , I returned to find that bare-walled room empty . I waited , sitting on the mattress that suddenly seemed too large , staring idiotically at her unfinished traps . <p> Her too-conspicuous absence filled the whole room , and the phantom of her brown skin gave me pins and needles in my fingertips ; they had lost the habit of embracing emptiness . <p> Sofia never came back - and without her , the hunt for sighs lost its savor . <p> Eventually , I resolved to go out in search of her . I looked for her in the blinding whiteness of the days and the muffled murmur of the nights , windows pitting the walls like shell craters . I walked at hazard along side streets so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canyons , crushed by the immensity . <p> Venice has many faults in her reality ; she quickly acquires the appearance of a Hall of Mirrors for those who take no heed of their route . She knows how to shuffle the lost traveler 's cards , playfully or maliciously . <p> I was careful not to look into the watery depths , for fear of stirring up disturbing ideas by association . As long as a disappearance remains a mere absence , one can retain the right to hope . But as I passed the small boats posed like nightwatchmen on the banks of the canal , I was n't sure that I wanted to know what they had seen . It was at one such station , at the very bottom of a staircase leading down to the water , that Sofia came back to me . <p> She surged out of the canal in a shower of mud , taking great care to sprinkle me . It was the most artful of baptisms : Venice putting her mark onmybody . She was on my face and my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be sure the day will ever come when I can get rid of her defilement . The clothes I wore that night I never wore again . <p> Sofia had an indecent smile upon her lips that was not her own . The skin of her face , bleached by her sojourn in the canal , was beginning to detach itself . One piece of frayed skin extended from a framework of bone where the nose jutted out like the beak of a bird mask . The discolored flesh formed a white stain upon the night , like the reflection of a new Moon in the water . <p> All that remained of her unraveled plait was a ragged mass of algae . Her sodden garments gushed with every gesture , and the once-light cotton of her dress constrained her as tightly as a courtesan 's corset . The perfume of salt and spices formerly exuded by her skin was concealed beneath a thick odor of silt . When she spoke , a trickle of dirty water ran from her lips . <p> Buona sera , Gio ! <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar voice . Venice spoke to me , using Sofia 's voice . As well as a baptism , I was offered a warning . It was not too late to redeem myself . <p> The night when Venice spoke to me , I saw myself in the shoes of Sisyphus at the hour of his judgment . Certain punishments are dizzying on the human scale , but what are they to a city ? Little more than a game . There was a logic to it , and I could n't see how to extricate myself therefrom . When I sealed our bargain with a word , I tried to stifle the small voice within me that howled in disgust . <p> I do n't belong to you , Madre Venezia . You 've taken Sofia , but you do n't have me . <p> I made a pact for my salvation : a compromise , admittedly , but at least I 've saved my life-for the moment . Venice claims her due , and here I am , having become her official hunter . Poacher of the Venetian Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do without it , thank you very much - but I have no choice . <p> Since that night , I prowl the flanks of the beast , hoping to have advance warning of the baring of its teeth . I carry the sounds of her nights in my shoulder bag . <p> March , soldier ! Your route will be long and the issue uncertain . <p> I ca n't afford to make mistakes ; I have so few traps left . Sofia never showed me her secrets . Even if she had , I have much less agile hands ; I would never be able to weave such threads . Her traps were so beautiful , and I have nothing else to keep in memory of her , but I ca n't keep them for myself . They 're too few in number for the task that awaits me . <p> I lost more than one of them near the Bridge of Sighs , in the days when I was still hunting entirely for myself : deposited there in the evening , they had vanished in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human thief , but I 'm no longer so sure . Cities sometimes play the rascal in their turn . The Bridge has n't budged since , always making its round back to avoid touching the surface of the water . The arch is almost too perfect - but I 'm the one who avoids it now . <p> I remember the expression that the tourists had when I whispered in their ears the nature of my merchandise . First a skeptical glance at my boxes , too light to contain anything that might be valuable ; then they read in my face a sincerity that made them dubious . The fear of being taken for a fool caused them to hesitate - but after all , why not ! And then , once the seed of doubt was sown , and because they needed to know , they parted uncomplainingly with an exorbitant sum . <p> I have many vices , but I 'm not a liar . I would have paid dearly to be present , just once , at one of those hotel bedroom scenes , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing falls out of my metallic box - which formerly contained coffee , sweets , or biscuits - but a single pebble : a fragment of Venice , like fingernail trimmings used in some voodoo spell . ( If only it were enough to kill her ! ) <p> But from this pebble , within the blink of an eye , a din erupts that suddenly fills the entire space . A noise of chains and footsteps , mingled with cries and sighs : the inescapable cadence of the march to the scaffold . Noises which speak of the gibbet and the executioner 's blade , sometimes mingled with laughter and insults . <p> And my pigeon ought by now to be cowering in a corner of the room , hands clasped to his ears - because he does not want that Venice . He was promised palaces and bridges , excursions in gondolas and banquets , not phantoms and executions . He would have realized then that I had not lied in promising him an authentic sigh captured on the Bridge : my own version of the sound of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of rip-off . <p> But I had never troubled myself with what became of my sighs once they had escaped from their box . They must have flown through the first open window and dispersed themselves in the air , but what then ? Did they return to enshrine themselves in the Bridge , or did they lose themselves in the Venetian night ? <p> One always asks oneself those questions too late . Lack of common sense or smug optimism - I plead guilty on both counts . <p> She has made me pay , the trollop . And ever since , she watches me with windows that are so many unsleeping eyes . <p> The terms of the deal are simple : Render to the Bridge one sigh for every one that I have stolen . The lex talionis of cities is no less refined than that of humans - for the punishment is not so much the task to be accomplished as the corruption of the eyesight . And I have orders not to quit her walls in search of new prizes . <p> One learns quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows and sighs . To see immediately behind appearances , and hear the secret sounds - for every setting , however sumptuous it might be , hides a darker side . Learn to hear the stones breathe , if it is necessary to do the job . Hear the pulse of the thick blood that nourishes the mineral dreams of the city . Sense - in every stone , in every wall - the reminiscence of a rarely peaceful past , the phantom of days of splendor and violence . <p> Her days are drawn out in restless activity , her nights are a carnival of shadows . At the emptiest hours , when the occasion arises , Venice pulsates to the rhythm of the splashing waves , which is less than a presence but more than a murmur , always cowering in the folds of silence . <p> Sometimes I think I hear the waters whispering my name , stirring the shadows as if the blackness were brooding . <p> Now that I know Venice without her makeup , I can see and foresee the things that have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolongation of a gaze . That is what she wishes me to be . <p> I watch out for traces at the street corners , and in the shadows of the bridges , always quick to draw out my traps . <p> Here , a joyful party has turned sour . Alcoholic vapors are mingled with the contours of the night , and at first light the lifeless body of a courtesan has been discovered . Somewhere nearby , the guests have consigned her cumbersome remains to the discretion of the waters . <p> It is there that I shall capture the first sigh to satisfy the city . <p> Down there , a little farther away , that bridge has borne witness to a cold-blooded murder : a traveler stabbed for his money and left there to die like a dog . <p> There are others there , without number : murders ; executions ; treasons ; suicides - and I only mention those whose traces I have rediscovered . Whether they perished by the blade , by fire , by drowning or by burning , the voices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's those that I track down . I play the part of a witness . <p> She is there too , the mark of History ; that is doubtless the lot of all great cities . Can one traverse the centuries and remain unchanged ? Venice has been populated by millions of souls . She has been made the confidante of thousands of plots and intrigues . Her waters have hidden " the disappeared " for centuries ; it is n't only the stones that are nourished by the past . The past is all that remains to her ; how can the neverending invasion be resisted , if not by clinging on to its acquisitions ? <p> As for me , I 've become a pinball moved by a flipper , which rebounds from one wall to another without ever checking its course . I accumulate points for want of the power to escape the machine . I hope to remain a long time apart from the hole that will signify the end of the party . I 'm not yet ready to lay down my arms . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water mixed in my blood . How can this permanent cough be explained , except as the after-taste of drowning ? I choke already in my dreams . If I delay too long , my corpse will probably be found one night at the back of an alleyway , its lungs full of turbid water . <p> One thing is certain , in any case : it 's not at the bottom of a canal that my course will terminate . Venice wo n't give me the satisfaction of letting me be reunited with Sofia . <p> At the least , I shall be cast as a stone myself , to take my place in a wall in my own turn . My skin is already dried up . My face is no more than a nest of itches and the tips of my fingers are beginning to crumble . If I do n't make haste to gain some respite by capturing another prize , I 'll soon lose the use of my hands . Venice would doubtless prefer that fate - slow and refined at the same time . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have digested so many others . I can no longer pass by a statue in this city without asking myself whether it was formerly something else , and for what crime it has been punished . <p> " My body in Venezia , a stone among the stones ? " <p> Sooner die a thousand times . I shall hunt until the end , and she ca n't count on me to surrender . <p> The watchful city does n't forget - but which of the two of us shall have the last word ? <p> Author Affiliation
