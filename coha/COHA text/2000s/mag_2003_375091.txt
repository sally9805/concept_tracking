What makes librarians raise their voices above a whisper ? Certain passages of the U.S.A. Patriot Act . Librarians are among the most vocal opponents of the law , taking particular exception to Section 215 , which they claim makes it easier for the government to search library records . " A big part of the public library system was to sustain democracy so people could make up their own mind about things , " says Carolyn Anthony , director of the Skokie Public Library near Chicago . " Aspects of the act compromise this . " <P> Before the Patriot Act , authorities could examine library records only after proving in open court that there was probable cause to suspect that a crime had been committed . The Patriot Act gave the government wider leeway by expanding the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , legislation that created secret courts to review applications for domestic wiretaps and searches in the name of national security . Now the government needs merely to convince a FISA court that looking at book-borrowing histories or library Internet usage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime has been committed . In addition , library employees are prohibited from revealing to anyone that a patron is under suspicion . <P> Many librarians believe that the policy violates the right to privacy , a right they take seriously . The 64,000-member American Library Association passed a resolution opposing " any use of governmental power to suppress ... or to intimidate individuals exercising free inquiry . " They are also protesting in more subtle ways .

" At the end of each day , Schaumburg , Ill. , library employees delete the names of those who have used computers . At a library in nearby Bridgeview , computer sign-up sheets have been eradicated altogether . <P> The Justice Department believes that librarians are overreacting . " I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding and a sense of unjustified hysteria , " says Assistant Attorney General Viet Dinh , who helped craft the act . Dinh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search library records . For instance , a federal grand jury authorized searches in the mid-1990s to learn who had checked out books mentioned in the Unabomber 's manifesto . Those subpoenas , however , were issued after officials provided a reasonable suspicion that the books were related to a committed crime . <P> It 's not clear how often the government has asked to search library records since the enactment of the Patriot Act , but in a recent survey conducted by the Library Research Center at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana , 545 of the 906 respondents said that in the year after the 9/11 attacks they had been visited by federal or local officials . But there is no evidence that the visits were connected to the Patriot Act , and some may have been routine searches related to local crimes . Meanwhile , not all librarians are leaving the stacks and taking to the streets . The survey showed that at 209 libraries , staff members voluntarily reported what they regarded as suspicious behavior by their patrons .  --  By Michele Orecklin .
