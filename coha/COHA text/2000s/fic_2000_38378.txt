THIS USED TO BE JUST A regular barn and now it 's a holy place . Have you ever seen so much Godly art ? That painting of the crucifix was specially made by Michael Roma who 's only nineteen , if you can imagine . God directed his hands , what other explanation is there for such skill ? Look at the sufferen on Jesus 's face , the blood at his side . Oftentimes people comment on how real it all is . Michael Roma did n't do it . Not really . How could a kid barely out of high school know about such sufferen ? God used Michael 's hands , that 's what 's generally said . What 's become of him since is the devil 's ways . Everyone agrees . We pray for him since what happened with that girl . Folks are divided about her . Some think she 's the devil 's maid and others think she works for the CIA because the government do n't want us to have our faith . If we have our faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other paintings are done by locals too . That black velvet one over there was done by Anna Marie Tina Louise . How 's that for a beautiful-name ? Would you guess she 's never painted before ? See how Jesus rolls his eyes up to heaven like that . Some say they 've seen those eyes move but others say that 's just hysterics . These other paintings , people just leave behind when they come . Here 's an interesting one in the corner . There 's Jesus , look at all that blood dripping from him , and by the blood I would judge he 's just stepped down from the cross and standen beside him , well I do n't know ' cause he 's dressed like a apostle but there 's those who say it 's Elvis . I 'm not sure what that 's all about but one thing I 've learned , it takes all kinds to serve the Lord . <p> Did you see that one over there ? Now what it is , is one of those styrofoam heads like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what someone 's done here is made it into Jesus ' face and this is a real crown of thorns pressed into his head , just like it was . What people started doing , and no one knows how it began , is they prick their fingers right here on this thorned crown and let their blood drip down his face . So this is the blood of the pilgrims . <p> I see you noticing the plastic flowers . They brighten up the place , do n't they ? I do n't know when that all started either . You know , it 's just what moves in people 's hearts . They come here with bouquets of flowers and they drop them around the room and eventually there 's a whole room filled with them and they still keep coming . They 're plastic so they last forever and we did n't know what to do with them all so finally we started hanging them from the ceiling . There are those that say this is what inspired that girl , or devil , or spy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who got Michael Roma turned . <p> You should see this place when all the candles are tit and it 's filled with pilgrims . How much holiness can-you imagine ? The Hail Mary starts getting said and the roof shakes with it . <p> Over here is where she comes . Bow your head . Do n't get too close . This is a holy place . She appeared right here to Mrs. Vandewhitter when she was milking the cow and she appears here every month , the first Saturday in the month at four r.M. , since . You should come back then . It 's so different . The parking lot is full and there 's music and dancers , and families and folks come in wheelchairs and crutches because she cures them . Well , not all of them . Who knows the reason ? Why did she choose to appear to Mrs. Vandewhitter , on this crummy rundown farm and not to Father Christen who has devoted his whole life to the Holy Lord ? Why did she appear to Mrs. Vandewhitter and not to Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tadpole ever since that horse kicked him and when Harry went through all that trouble , with the ambulance and everything , to bring little Harry here , why did he leave the same way he come , drooling and asleep ? Who can understand about these things ? <p> She wears a white robe with a blue sash , is what Mrs. Vandewhitter says , and she is T.O . ' d . That 's just how Mrs. Vandewhitter says it . " Our Blessed Virgin Mother is T.O . ' d with you all , " she says . Every time . Though really , the pilgrims pray and pray . You can see it by the way they clutch those rosaries so tight and squeeze their eyes shut or look to heaven , or the ceiling of the barn depending if they get to be inside or not . " She 's T.O.d at you all , and she says her son " ( that would be Jesus ) " is really pissed . " <p> Oh , you should see the photographs . Here , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these pictures of their family , dogs , cats . I do n't know what that 's about . Here 's one , this is what I was looking for . See that cloud , now this has happened many times but most people , they take the photographs with them , see , right there in the sky ? That 's the door to heaven , you know . It appears when she comes and you can get a picture of it too , when you come back , but it only occurs with a instamatic camera . Who knows the reason ? <p> Faith and God 's hands . That 's the best explanation for what ca n't be understood by any other route . Thousands know that . They come here because of it . They spend their savings to get here . Quit their jobs . Leave families . Right there . She stands in her white robe with the blue sash and she says , " Pray . " And they pray . " Because the Blessed Virgin is T.O . ' d and Jesus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mess we have in this world . Thousands come here and that little girl , all she got is Michael Roma . What does that tell you ? Flower angel , my foot . <p> There have been false claims before . People ai n't so naive as maybe they once were . There was the lady from Albany who said the virgin appeared to her in the shape of a potato but she never could find that particular potato again and folks had a hard time believing that if what she said was true she would just up and forget and make potato salad out of the virgin 's miracle . There was also the fellow who said he was Jesus but he did n't know most of the bible ; could n't recite a whole Hail Mary , and was seen singing rap songs with some kids in Felder 's pasture . Then there 's her . Sure , she was pretty , nobody will deny you that . Some say she had a glow about her , which , it is also reasoned , is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the CIA can make the whole world believe that Russia is no longer a threat , then certainly it is no problem for them to make a girl glow . <p> So the first disruptive thing she does is she says , right while Mrs. Vandewhitter is repeating what the virgin has just told her ( the part about being T.O . ' dj , she says , in a clear voice , not necessarily that loud , but how loud do you have to be to disrupt the entire proceedings in a place so quiet as a church ? She says , " But there 's nothing there at alL " This is what 's been quoted generally . " But there 's nothing there at all . " People shifted some , hushed her up . They came to listen to Mrs. Vandewhitter . Well , not even Mrs. Vandewhitter , they came to listen to the Blessed Virgin speaking to Mrs. Vandewhitter who then relays the message . <p> Maybe you noticed there ai n't no pews or benches . More people can fill the space that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's holy in here when she comes . They always say the rosary for a few hours before she appears so there 's just this feeling in the air . The general excitement . It 's golden with all the candles . And Michael Roma 's painting is right up there . It used to be right there near to where Mrs. Vandewhitter speaks but it got moved since the controversy . Michael Roma use to stand right next to the painting and it would be fair to say he 's a handsome lad . Dark hair . Blue eyes . Good teeth . <p> So when she says this thing , " But there 's nothing there , " folks just hushed her up and leaned away from her just enough so that Michael could see who spoke and I heard at least one account that suggests she was n't the devil , or a CIA spy and it was all just a matter of love at first sight , what with him so dark and intense by that painting of his , and her , so pale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you say ? " he said as if Mrs. Vandewhitter was not just then speaking the virgin 's words , as if the miracle that was occurring was not that , but this pretty girl 's face . <p> " I said , nothing 's there . " <p> Mrs. Vandewhitter frowned and raised her voice . " She 's gone now , " Michael said , just as though he was having a private conversation and not standing in a full to capacity room , interrupting a miracle . <p> " But she was never there , " said the girl . " I can see perfectly well , and there was nothing there at all . " <p> The crowd was restless and murmuring . They did not come here to listen to teenagers prattling . They came to hear the message of Mary , the holy virgin and this little blonde person was ruining everything . <p> Michael sensed this . He stood at the helm , so to speak , and could see the crowd 's impatience . " Not everyone can see her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed to be bravely trying to ignore the whole thing . Later , I heard her say one word to Emmet Grady who cleans up around here after the miracles . " Hormones , " she said . <p> " Well , I do n't know why that would be the case , " said this girl , " because she makes it rain roses in my backyard every morning , why would n't she let me see her here ? " <p> It is said that you could see the change come over Michael , like his whole posture changed and people even murmured , no , no . Even Mrs. Vandewhitter had lost her place and was up there shaking her head at him . <p> He goes , " Roses ? " <p> " Yes , " she says , " every morning it rains roses in my backyard . Hundreds and hundreds of them . " <p> " With thorns or without ? " <p> " Without , " she said . " Shorn , so I can pick them up and never prick my skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those who say you could see the way he was fighting inside but the devil was just so strong and that girl was just too pretty . He just stands there so Mrs. Vandewhitter , confused where she left off , starts at the beginning again which is always the same . " The Blessed Virgin Mother is T.O . ' d at you all , she said , and Jesus is - " <p> " What kind of roses ? " <p> " Oh there 's Topaz , Jewel , Windrush , Pearl Drift , Lavender Dream , Angel Face , Sweet Juliet , China Doll , French Lace , Maiden 's Blush , Sea Foam , Fairy . Should I continue ? " <p> " What do you do with them ? " <p> " Potpourri . Dream pillows . Perfume . Shampoo . Candles . Rose jam . Rose chicken . Rose butter . Rose bread . I give them away to children , to the old , to the sick . " <p> Because you are not praying enough , " Mrs. Vandewhitter says to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael asks . <p> " In the hills outside of town . " <p> " Why have n't I seen you before ? " <p> " My mother home-schooled me , and after she died last winter , that 's when the roses started to fall . " <p> " They fall in winter ? " <p> It was a miracle and a pickup all occurring at the same time . Mrs. Vandewhitter , having raised five teenagers of her own , just ignored them as did most of the pilgrims . Some of their conversation has been lost in the confusion but this is about the gist of it . And , I 'm sorry to say , he left with her . Even before Mrs. Vandewhitter was done saying the holy words . <p> Who can understand the ways of the Lord ? That 's what Mrs. Vandewhitter says . The need is so great . People just keep coming and coming and they are , generally , wanting . Whatever you give them , they want more . More than the Blessed Virgin 's words , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they ca n't be satisfied . So the Blessed Virgin told Mrs. Vandewhitter to build a gift shop and - Oh , the boy ? <p> Well , there are rumors that he comes into town with bouquets of roses for the hospital and nursing home . Those that seen him say he 's grown his dark hair long and curly and wears a little gold Baring shaped like a rose and paints pictures of that girl , naked pictures that he sells in the city and also , that he sort of glows . But of course that do n't mean a thing . Roses can be bought or grown . And it do n't take much to guess what 's got a boy his age , in his situation , glowing . <p> Author Affiliation
