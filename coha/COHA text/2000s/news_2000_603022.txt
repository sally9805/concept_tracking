<p> Hot lights , movie stars and an overflow crowd of 1,700 converged on a cold Manhattan night last week to celebrate a Hollywood-style opening . <p> But it was n't the latest big-budget film  --  merely the second-season premiere of HBO 's The Sopranos , the hugely praised , highly rated drama that chronicles the midlife crisis of a New Jersey mobster and redefines " family , " both nuclear and Mafia . <p> That a TV show  --  on cable , no less  --  could leave throngs clamoring is a remarkable feat not lost on Edie Falco , who plays mob wife Carmela Soprano . <p> " We 're a little dumbfounded , frankly , " she says . " I do n't think any of us gauged this kind of response . " <p> Sopranos creator David Chase says he was pleasantly surprised , too . " We wondered who was going to watch it . We thought critics would say , ' Another Mafia show ? Please do n't do this to us . ' And as far as the general public was concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Evidently not : <p> * There are the ratings . With only 13 episodes aired so far , The Sopranos is HBO 's most-watched series ever . With an average 10 million viewers spread across four weekly airings , the show 's combined audience rivals that of major network fare , such as Just Shoot Me and Sports Night . <p> * There are the accolades . The series won 16 Emmy nominations  --  the most of any show last year  --  and five Golden Globe nominations . And The New York Times breathlessly proclaimed The Sopranos " the greatest work of American pop culture of the past quarter-century . " <p> * There 's the worldwide phenomenon . The show is already airing in the U.K. , Australia and France , and will debut this spring in Germany and Italy , where one of the new season 's episodes was filmed . <p> * And there 's the instant fame . The Sopranos cast members , a largely unknown group of New York-area actors , have been transformed into major stars whose fans recognize them on city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season Sunday ( 9 p.m . ET/PT ) with 13 new episodes , chronicles the conflicted life of Tony Soprano ( played by James Gandolfini ) and his twin " families " : dutiful wife Carmela and two kids in a garish suburban New Jersey home , and the more figurative mob family , which also happens to include Tony 's manipulative mother Livia ( Nancy Marchand ) , his uncle Junior ( Dominic Chianese ) and his hotheaded nephew , Christopher ( Michael Imperioli ) , who yearns to be a screenwriter or , at least , a " made man , " in mobster parlance . <p> The Sopranos is a study in contrasts . Both brutal and profane , it 's also at times funny and poignant . Burly , balding Gandolfini , 38 , plays a Mafia boss who 's vicious with mob traitors , yet powerless to control his own teenage daughter . And the clash between " old-school " mobsters  --  who " wash our own dirty laundry , " as Tony says  - -  and a younger generation of rebels threatens to undermine the tightly ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony 's confidences to his therapist , Jennifer Melfi ( Lorraine Bracco ) , and his increasingly fractious relationships with his mother and uncle , who both conspired to whack him . <p> But those three characters are noticeably in the background in the new season 's early episodes . Junior is jailed , Melfi 's on the lam , and Livia suffers a stroke ( or is she faking ? ) after Tony learns she ordered the hit . <p> Instead , look for two new faces to surface as adversaries for Tony . Aida Turturro ( cousin of actors John and Nicholas ) plays Tony 's sister Janice , a commune-dwelling scam artist long estranged from the family who returns to New Jersey from Seattle . And David Proval shows up as vicious mobster Richie Aprile , the brother of a former capo , who died of cancer last season . Recently released from prison , Richie wants to get back in the action . <p> Drea de Matteo , who plays Adriana , the aspiring music manager and girlfriend of Soprano nephew Christopher , also becomes a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal is its twisted take on family values . Even the matriarch of the Soprano family is sneaky and dangerous . Producers reversed a plan to kill off Livia after viewers responded favorably to her tactics . <p> But Marchand , who 's battling cancer , believes Livia 's not all evil . ( " She 's not malevolent , " Marchand insists . " She 's just sort of a self-involved goonbag . " ) <p> As for Junior , a formerly doting uncle who seeks murderous revenge , " he 's not exactly an altruistic guy who volunteers at the nursing home , " says his portrayer , Dominic Chianese . " He 's an interesting guy because he 's so villainous . " <p> But like many of the relative unknowns among the Sopranos cast , Chianese , 68  --  who appeared in The Godfather Part II and HBO 's Gotti , among other films  --  says the show has " changed my whole career . It 's turned it around completely . " <p> So it did for series creator Chase , a veteran TV writer/producer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later worked on The Rockford Files , I 'll Fly Away and Northern Exposure . <p> Now , Chase 's distinctive work has become a beacon of sorts for network programmers seeking something besides retro quiz shows to galvanize viewers . <p> " It suggests to more traditional broadcasters that without being offensive , they need to be a little less restrictive , " says Warner Bros . TV president Peter Roth . <p> Industry insiders praise the excellent writing and acting , but they view the show 's rough language and occasional brutality as crucial to the show 's realism . And some believe TV 's loosening standards would permit broadcasters to emulate it . <p> NYPD Blue producer Steven Bochco says , " If HBO went out of business tomorrow , do you think one of the networks would n't put it on ? I 'd bet you my house . " <p> " The fact is that most of the stuff on Sopranos you could put on network television , " NBC Entertainment chief Garth Ancier says . " But there 's a question of how sensitive advertisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubious . " The rhythm of the writing on this show , let alone the language and violence , would never have survived the network system , " executive producer Brad Grey says . " Can you imagine a show where a guy goes into the hospital with a pillow to take his mother out ? " <p> HBO 's advantage is that it has no advertisers to offend , and the fact that viewers pay to receive it lessens its burden in policing content . <p> Moreover , The Sopranos avoids the need for predictable  --  and sometimes phony  --  dramatic peaks every 11 minutes to keep viewers tuned to commercial breaks that follow . Instead , the show is paced more like a feature film , and it often lasts a full hour even without ads . <p> For these reasons , Tom Fontana , a Sopranos fan who produces HBO 's Oz , believes it 's unlikely to spur a wave of edgy imitators . " I do n't feel like the success of The Sopranos is really going to have a long-term effect on opening up broadcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to still have its own needs and fears . " <p> And it 's not just the rough language , occasional nudity or violence that you 'd expect , Fontana says . " I think it 's the relationships they 'd be afraid of . Networks expect them to be much less troublesome than they are on The Sopranos . If you went to them and pitched the relationship between Gandolfini and Marchand , they would chase you out with a broom . " <p> Chase agrees : " I think they might long to do something like this , but I think in the end the machine that is network TV would end up cooking the vitamins out . " <p> For the pay-cable channel , however , the series has been like ziti from heaven . HBO grabbed The Sopranos  --  its most expensive ever to produce , at $ 2 million an episode  --  after Fox bought , then rejected a script . <p> Although the channel expects to gain subscribers , so far there 's no hard evidence to support it , only anecdotal reports from cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 million U.S. TV homes ) . But HBO chief Jeff Bewkes expects that day will come . <p> " We 're trying to make television that 's worth paying for , " he says . " If HBO 's got the best show on TV , that 's got to be good for business . " &lt;&gt; <p> Each episode of The Sopranos airs four times each week on HBO . New episodes begin Sunday . Times are : <p> Sundays , 9 ET/PT ( premiere ) <p> Tuesdays , 11ET/PT <p> Wednesdays , 9 ET/PT <p> Saturdays , 11:30 ET/PT ( time approximate ) <p> Italian-Americans levy gripes <p> Amid the kudos for The Sopranos runs an undercurrent of dissent . <p> Bill Dal Cerro , a Chicago high school teacher and spokesman for the Italic Studies Institute , says The Sopranos , like most mob feature films , " institutionalizes the whole idea that crime is part of the normal Italian culture , " adding that few films or TV shows depict Italians in any other setting . " If we 're not gangsters , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> A group of seven other Italian-American organizations complained Monday that HBO and the series " are guilty of defaming and assassinating the cultural character of Italian-Americans by using their religion , customs and values in a violent and immoral context . " The groups include the National Italian-American Foundation , the Coalition of Italian American Associations and the Italian American One Voice Committee . <p> Sopranos creator David Chase , whose four grandparents came from Italy , thinks " Italian-Americans who find this a negative are wrong , because I think they 're not allowing for the fact that human beings love gangsters .
