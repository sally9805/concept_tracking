Chapter One " What do you know about art , Volk ? " Maxim Abdullaev hurls the question through the airwaves as if it were an ax , cleaving pretense . I cram my Nokia cell phone against my ear . Clattering dishes , jostling diners , and raised voices give me an excuse to delay answering his question . " Hold on , " I say , then step downstairs to my table in the basement of Vadim 's Caf near Staraya Street , where I make my office . Maxim could be anywhere . His headquarters are in the Solsnetskaya neighborhood just a few blocks away , but he changes his personal place of business weekly , sometimes daily , so it is impossible to develop a mental picture of where he is or what he is doing . Once I 've moved away from the din , I take a moment to gather my thoughts . " Art ? I have a master 's in art history from Moscow University . " I 'm sure that Maxim knows enough about my life to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty , and five years of killing and worse in Chechnya unsurprisingly failed to harmonize into a world-class education . The things I have learned are not taught in universities . He barks a deep-throated chuckle thatoffers no comfort . A polar bear probably makes the same sound just before it eats . " Listen , " he says . " You do something for me . Talk to Gromov . Yes ? " " Yes , " I say , as if I have a choice , and Maxim disconnects . Two hours later , nearing midnight , Gromov clumps like a plow horse into my basement office . The flesh on his bald head and puffy face droops like a shar-pei 's skin and slits his eyes , which are shifty-nervous , with good cause . Valya lurks hidden among the shelves of caf sundries behind him . " You talked to Maxim ? " he says . I grunt acknowledgment . He collapses into a padded roller chair that disappears , creaking , beneath his bulk . Even its silvery round feet are covered by the hanging folds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep pocket . He likes to show off a chromed Colt .45 Peacemaker , an outdated cannon that rends great holes in bodies , a good weapon for a man whose business is intimidation . " I got a business opportunity , " he begins . " Maxim says you 're the guy to help me assess it . " " I do n't do partners . " He knows this . My rule is one source of the friction between us . " Yeah , yeah . " Scarred leather biker boots twirl the chair as he takes in the surroundings . There 's not much to see here in the basement level . Black slate floor , rows of shelves , exposed raw-wood beams , plaster walls randomly damaged to show the red brick beneath , and dusty ' 60s-era slot machines . Gromov is looking for Valya , I know , but she wo n't be seen unless she wants to be . He finishes his survey and grins through crooked yellow teeth ridged black with omnipresent chewing tobacco . AN style= " mso-tab-count : 1 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you came to say . " I point to the empty tabletop in front of me . " I 've got work to do . " " You know diamonds ? " " Maxim says art , you say diamonds . Which is it ? " " Same thing , asshole . " When he yanks his hand from his overcoat pocket , Valya materializes behind him and aims the short barrel of a pistol-grip , 12-gauge Mossberg at the back of his shaved skull . But instead of drawing the Colt , he tosses a crystal rectangle that tumbles sparkling through the air before smacking into my palm . Valya withdraws . Gromov leans back , smugly oblivious to the nearness of death , while I examine his prize . The stone is about one centimeter square by three long . One end is broken , jagging up into a ragged half peak . Unreadable inscriptions are etched into its flat sides . The etchings are names written in Persian , I know . I toss it back , and he catches it deftly . " You 're an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big that his face widens into a pyramid when he clenches his teeth . " Fuck you . " I wave toward his hand . " That 's a bad imitation of the Shah Diamond . The real one 's five blocks up the road in the Kremlin Armory under more security than Putin . " That 's a lie . The real one 's gone . It was originally a gift to Tsar Nicholas I to atone for a Russian diplomat made dead in 1820s Tehran . Famous , in part , because all the unlucky owners named in the inscriptions died owning it . Damn near ninety carats preserved in uncut form . Three years ago I helped it make a symbolic but unpublicized journey back to Persia , to the rare arts collection of a spoiled Saudi prince , in return for financial considerations benefiting my primary patron , the Russian army . A better fake than this one sits behind glass under twenty-four-hour security in the Kremlin 's Diamond Fund . " See ? " he says . " You know about this kind of shit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He leans forward as far as his muscle-bound body will allow and settles flying-buttress elbows on my table , which groans but holds . Like much of the older furniture in Moscow , it was sturdily built by cold gulag hands . " What if I told you I could get the real thing , with nobody the wiser ? " " You ca n't . Do n't waste my time . " " Listen . " He scrunches his broad face , concentrating . " We got inside guys . Military , pissed off by Putin capitalism . They 're like pensioners on the dole while guys like us get rich . They take the diamond , replace it with the fake . Think about it . The fucker 's under glass all day , like goddamn Lenin . Who knows if what 's under there is real ? Who cares ? In five years some Swiss prick looks at it under a microscope and raises hell . By then , shit , there 's no way to trace who did what and when . " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You just worry about your end , " he says . " What 's my end ? " " Work the distribution angle . " Gromov 's running hot , trembling , obviously excited . " You 're tight with that fag , Nigel Bolles . " He mouths Nigel 's name with curled-lip contempt . " He 'll point you to guys in London or New York or wherever and help us find someone with too much money to buy it . " " I 'm not your guy . " His jaw drops . " Why not ? " " I told you . I do n't do partners . And I think your chances of getting the real thing out of there are zero . " Pounding veins ripple under the five o'clock shadow that darkens his enormous dome . " Why do you make things so fucking hard , Volk ? Three times I say let 's do business . Three times you tell me to fuck off . " He rolls mountainous shoulders , as if to make room under the overcoat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around you 're there . You 're in my way . " He 's right about our businesses bumping into each other , at least the parts of mine he knows about-drugs , identity theft , pictures , and a Russian brides operation that caters to the middle classes of America and industrialized European and Asian countries . Russia has ten million more women than men , one product of her endless fighting and purging , and she always imports more than she exports . I figure the bride business evens out both imbalances . Gromov 's interests collide with mine in several ways , although he 's big into child prostitution and other things that I wo n't touch . But he 's wrong to worry about it , because there 's plenty of business for both of us on this little stretch of road below old Lubyanka prison and because the Internet has made us international . " Do n't be so parochial , Gromov . " " What the fuck does that mean ? " " It means we 'll get along fine if you concentrate on business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyudmilla . Just stay away from me . " He does n't like my way of rejecting him or the reference to his billowy-breasted girlfriend . He stands so suddenly his chair overturns . Snarls , roars something unintelligible , hauls out his hand cannon , and starts to bear down , slow and amateurish . I do n't think he 's going to fire . He just wants to make a point . But then the racking slide of a shotgun cracks through everything . He stops dead . His eyes click back and forth like the ones in the plastic clocks that look like tail-wagging pets , but he 's careful not to turn around and provoke her . " It 's Valya , " I offer , and both of his hands go up slowly until the muzzle of the Colt brushes the bottom of a low beam . She 's behind him , looking amped , ready for anything , almost lost in lace-up boots , cinched parachute pants , and a chrome-colored jacket with its sable-lined hood turned down . The Mossberg rests lightly in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm done , " he says without turning around . I nod at him , and he shucks open the overcoat and slots the Colt into a holster made from more than one cow . " I got no choice , " he says in the same tone you use to tell a cabdriver to turn right . " I got ta put you out of business , gimp . " The gibe about my foot does n't bother me . Impending war does , especially given Maxim 's newly found interest in the world of art . The General and I had three years to operate freely in that arena . I wish our time was n't coming to an end . " Have at it , big man , " I say . He turns fast , but Valya is nowhere to be seen . One last baleful look at me , and then Gromov lumbers away . Lunch the next day is sliced smoked pork on the sunny side of an outdoor gazebo in grassy Gorky Park . Halfway through , I 'm joined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe . He approaches with his spindly chest puffed out , slides his baton into a steel ring attached to his belt , and plops down across from me . The sun glints through the silver birch trees and gambols off the gold double-headed Russian eagle in his cap as I slide an envelope stuffed with American dollars across the plastic tabletop . He plucks the envelope and tucks it under his leg , fast and furtive . " Shit , Volk ! " His eyes dart , but I 'm busy with the pork . I do n't care who sees . I stop chewing long enough to say , " There 's an extra five hundred for Viktor . And a note . " Viktor commands Yuri 's area . He 's been on my payroll for two years . The note explains the information I want about Gromov , and the extra money pays for it . Gromov is probably paying for similar reports about me . Yuri pulls a foil-wrapped sandwich from a brown bag blotched with oil stains , but then he sits and watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and licks the down on his upper lip , which has been the same since I met him a year ago , so I suppose it 's a mustache . " Where 's Valya ? " he asks . The pork is gone . I suck the fat off my fingers and pat his balding head . He 's younger than me , mid-twenties , but the hair gods are fickle . He 's softer than me as well . War and want have hardened my appearance . Military-cut bronze hair , hazel eyes with a feral blaze , stubbled jaw-I look ferocious even when I 'm trying not to . Each pat makes his head bounce . " Do n't mess with me , Yuri . " His eyes widen . " God no , Volk . " I leave him to his sandwich . I 'm tromping through the high grass of Gorky Park to my Mercedes S-600 when the Nokia buzzes . " Go . " " It 's Nigel . " Bolles . My largest procurer of foreign business . The British expat fop Gromov asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's out you 're in a war , old boy , " he says . His lilting voice is strained , due , no doubt , to a night of hard drinking and no morning Stolichnaya fix . " Business is always tough . " " How can I help ? " Just what I need . " The British are coming , " I say , but he apparently misses the negative reference . " Precisely . I am at your service . " " Just keep finding customers . " " Right . " He clears his throat . It sounds like a cold motor coughing to life . " In that regard , you 'll be pleased to learn I have an opportunity for tonight . Swiss conventioneers with a common interest . " " Just drugs ? " " Boys and girls , too . " He sounds regretful . He knows my scruple , silly as it is . In the end , what difference who makes the money ? The children are pincushions either way . I stop on a knoll carpeted with flattened grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind blows chill over the Moscow River and bends the tops of the stately line of birches that march up the embankment toward the towering peaks of the university . Industrial haze blurs the cityscape . The spires of Stalin 's other Seven Sisters pierce the haze like upthrust stilettos . Gromov is manageable . I know I can dispatch him with relative ease . But he 's one of Maxim 's poodles , and as chieftain of the Azeri mafia , Maxim can crush my enterprises on a whim . " Are you still there , Volk ? " I grit my teeth . " I 'll meet you at the National Club at ten to arrange the details . " My chest tightens , and suddenly I feel as if I ca n't take in enough air . " Well done . " He 's reenergized , doubtless calculating his twenty percent cut . I end the call , limp to the Mercedes favoring my newly throbbing stump , and crank the shiny black car into heavy traffic , already ruing my decision . The cell buzzes again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who wants to know ? " " It 's Arkady . " Several years have passed since I last heard from Arkady Borodenkov-one of my companions in a foster care facility and , later , at a rehabilitation center for boys situated on the Baltic shore . A childhood friend in places where friends were scarce . And last I heard , an Ecstasy distributor and part-time fence in St. Petersburg . Slightly built , with blond hair worn long , too weak for anything except the fringes . " What 's up ? " I say . " I got a weird one for you . A score that needs muscle and hustle . But mostly it needs brains . I thought of you . " I cut through traffic and outraged pedestrians on Kremlevskaya Street , make an illegal U-turn and then a hard right and rattle over unevenly laid bricks on the edge of Red Square . St. Basil 's Cathedral looms on the left , its colorful domes like ice-cream swirls . The bright colors and the crowds lined up around the cathedral seem to be mocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm not even sure how to describe it . " I 'm in no mood for stalling , not while the scum of the deal I just made with Nigel still coats the inside of my mouth . " Spit it out . " " What do you know about art , Volk ? "
