MY SISTER , HELEN , is a fierce believer in the preternatural connection between twins . Twinnergy , she calls it . She 's been convinced of this phenomenon for over thirty years , since our first day of school , when we were separated for the first time and sent to different classrooms . She swears she could feel my intense sorrow over her absence , and could even picture me sitting at my desk chewing the ends of my hair in my anguish , but I do n't remember anything except my crisp new Tip and Mittens reader . There have been times when she called me from her home in Atlanta to say things like , " My foot is tingling ! Did you stub your toe ? " I 've always known it would be easier to just say , " You know , I did stub my toe ! Is n't that something ? " But I 've never done that . I 've always said , " Sorry . No . " <p> This afternoon , Helen pulls her minivan into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a forgettable kind of place on the Forgotten Coast of Florida . The reason for her six-hour trek from Georgia is twofold : to put this house on the market , and to take our mother back to Atlanta and put her into a nursing home close to her house . Late last spring , we agreed that I 'd sublet my apartment in North Carolina , say good-bye to Marty , and take a leave of absence from teaching for one year so Mama could spend her remaining lucidity in a familiar setting . After that the responsibility was Helens . The year is n't up but the lucidity is , and the dementia and wandering are getting to be too much for me to handle . I have both longed for and dreaded this visit . I thought perhaps the moment Helen parked , I would become resolved to one feeling , relief or reluctance , and be able to move forward from there , but no . Both feelings are still present , coexisting more than wrestling with each other , which is somehow worse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minivan is , " What are you doing to make the azaleas so beautiful ? " It 's true , the azaleas are particularly lovely this season . I have spent much of my free time-what there is of it-tending to the azaleas that our mother planted along the perimeter of the house the year our father left . In the late fall , I dug up all the volunteer palmettos and trumpet vines that choked the bushes , and a month ago I started fertilizing . Seeing them full of sherbet-colored blooms has been one of my few pleasures recently . But I do n't want Helen to ask about the azaleas . I want her to ask about our mother-to ask about me . <p> " How was your trip ? " I reply . <p> Before she can answer me , I see the heads of my nephews peeking out of the tinted van windows , and add , " You brought the boys . " I smile at them , but I am not happy that they are here . I specifically asked Helen not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to handle their grandmother , or that she 'll be able to handle them . <p> " Yes . It 's spring break , and Larry ca n't get off work . Did n't I tell you ? " <p> She swings back the van door . Garrett , the seven-year-old , is huddled in the back , cradling a stuffed dog in his arms . He is built much like his mother and me , long and bony , and has the same blond hair we once had , that particular shade of platinum only available in childhood , but he is pretty in the way that she was and I was not . I never quite understood how we could be identical because when we stood side by side , you could n't help but think that she was more attractive . Looking at him now , I think it could be something about the jaw line , or perhaps the brow . <p> Bradley , on the other hand , is more like his father-round and pale , with shocking red hair and spatters of freckles so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackers cake his face . I undo the belt to his car seat , and he throws both his arms and legs around me . I feel guilty enjoying his embrace so much . He smells earthy and sweet , like apple juice . <p> " Leave the bags , " Helen says , and I walk up the porch steps with Bradley straddling my hip . Helen follows , moving slowly , holding Garrett 's hand and whispering something in his ear . Mama is visible through the screen door , perched in her wingback chair , blanket tucked around her legs , her little Yorkshire terrier , Sasha , in her arms-just as I left her . For the occasion , I washed her hair and tied it in a knot at the back of her head , the way she began wearing it when she was promoted to principal of the elementary school , as if the hairdo somehow symbolized her new authority . Right now , with her mouth closed , she looks completely sane , even a little regal . <p> " Grandma ! " Bradley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to climb into her chair , Sasha growls . <p> " Bad dog , " says Bradley . <p> I shoo Sasha away . " She 's a little testy , " I say . " I mean the dog . " <p> Bradley scrambles onto his grandmothers lap . He strokes the underside of her throat , which has grown furrier and fatter . <p> " You 're a nice boy , " she says . " Would you happen to have a cigarette ? " <p> Bradley laughs at this , thank God , but his mother does n't . She stares at the scene from the other side of the screen door , with Garret tucked in by her side , rigorously petting his stuffed dog . <p> I make a pot roast for dinner , and Helen fills a glass bowl with azaleas and puts it on the table as a centerpiece . It reminds me of when we were kids , gardening with our mother . While I was on my knees , pulling wild onions out of the flower beds , getting dirt under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making dandelion crowns and necklaces by tearing holes in the stems with her thumbnails and threading the flowers together . <p> Our mother uses a large spoon to eat and clutches it in her fist like a toddler . Bradley does the same , and I might have believed that was just how he ate if he was n't watching her with an eagle eye . Garrett pushes his food around his plate and feeds a few pieces to Sasha , who knows it is profitable to stand under the table when my mother is eating . If Helen notices , she does n't say anything . <p> " There 's peanut butter and jelly , if you 'd rather , " I say . <p> " I saw it , " says Garrett . " It 's not the right kind of peanut butter . " <p> " It 's not the right kind of peanut butter , " my mother repeats . Garrett 's eyes widen , and I have to choke down the bit of meat in my throat . I know this is something she does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After the meal , Helen does the dishes and I take our mother out to the porch and give her one of her cigarettes . I 've learned to monitor this habit . If I let her keep the pack , she will smoke them all in one sitting . I tell her I 'm going to the store later , for peanut butter without nuts and orange juice without flakes ( " That means no pulp , " Helen tells me , as if I might not have guessed ) . Does she want anything ? <p> " Do they have Prince Albert in a can ? " Mama asks . <p> " No , " I say , " they let him out . " <p> She stubs out her cigarette on the table , just inches from the ashtray . " You ruined the joke . " <p> Good , I think . I do n't feel like joking . But for some reason , I feel like I 've done something egregious . <p> Before I go shopping , Helen bathes the boys while I bathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dogs . <p> This is the second time that I have put my own life on hold to care for a dying parent . My father started going downhill in his late forties ( emphysema , cancer ) around the time I finished graduate school . I had returned home to forget about the boy who did n't ask me to marry him and to help Helen with her wedding . On one of those afternoons when those two tasks were severely in conflict , I dropped by my fathers house , only to find him propped up in a thinly upholstered chair in front of the television , the whole room smelling of canned spaghetti and stale newspapers . His eyes were yellow , his gigantic hands rested on his knees , his long fingers stretching down his shins . He sat just breathing pure oxygen through a tube in his throat . <p> " Hello , Helen , " he said , but I was too busy taking it all in to correct him . I made about fifteen minutes ' worth of small talk , washed every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's . <p> " Why did n't you tell me ? " I asked her . <p> " He 's managing . " <p> " He 's not managing . Someone 's going to have to stay with him . " <p> " He does n't need anybody , " she said , not bothering to look up from her sewing machine , where she was pushing the pink cotton fabric that would become the flower girl 's dress underneath the pounding needle . " And even if he does , it 's not going to be me . " <p> That was fair . My father had left home shortly after our seventh birthday , only to move three houses down . The only explanation my sister and I were ever able to finagle out of him was , " There were just too many things . " ( What exactly those things were has been a much-debated subject most of our lives . My sister interprets things as other women to fuck , but I 'm pretty sure he meant daughters . ) He and my mother managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parenthood , coming to consensus on such issues as the appropriate age for girls to get their ears pierced ( twelve ) and whether to refinance the house ( yes ) . But their romantic life yo-yoed throughout the years . There were mornings when we awoke to find our mother wearing her terry cloth bathrobe with our father at the kitchen table , jabbing a corner of toast into a runny bit of egg ; other mornings our mother stood at the kitchen window staring at the unfamiliar car in our father 's driveway , blowing fiercely on her coffee . <p> I knew my sister was definitely out , what with the upcoming nuptials and all , but I consulted her anyway . I wanted some kind of agreement , her acknowledgment that I was n't the sole player here , but simply the team member who was currently injury free . All she said was , " Do what you have to do , " and went back to flipping through her bridal magazine . <p> So I did what adults do when there 's no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He held on for nearly a year . I thought maybe when it was time to send him off , Helen would come down to help me bury him . In the end she sent a sympathy card . My heart is with you in this sad time , it said on the cover . She had signed her name and her husband 's , and directed me to put the enclosed check toward whatever funeral expenses were involved . I dialed her number three times , hanging up each time she answered , before depositing the check . <p> At the grocery store , I get the peanut butter , the orange juice , and two packs of cigarettes-one for Mama , one for me , even though I have n't smoked since college . A woman from my mothers church is in line ahead of me . She puts her hand on my arm and asks how my mother is doing . <p> I say , " She 's nuts . " <p> There 's something about the grocery store that makes you want to tell the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman nods her head . I can tell she wants to get away from me as quickly as possible . <p> When our mother was first diagnosed , the doctor explained that her condition was caused by clumps and tangles in the brain that block messages between cells . <p> " So what we have here , " he said , " is a failure of the cells to communicate . " <p> It was not the first time he 'd made that joke , I was sure . He combed his fingers through his hair , chuckling , and I wondered if anyone else had ever thought it was funny . <p> In the parking lot , I light up one of my cigarettes and almost gag : menthol . The taste is like campfire and toothpaste , but I smoke it anyway , as well as two others . My mother 's house is only three blocks from the grocery store , but I take my time , making a few loops around the seafood houses on nearby streets before I head back <p> Helen is sitting on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She pats the space beside her , and I sit , light-headed , with the groceries in my lap . <p> " I love night , " she says . " It 's the only break I get from the kids . " <p> " I can imagine . " But I ca n't . When I fantasize about motherhood , my children are never a burden . <p> " It must be the same for you , " she says . " With Mom , I mean . " <p> I do nt say anything . I do n't know how she can think we have equal burdens . Perhaps some motions are the same , but not the payoff . This is more like caring for a snake slithering out of its skin , and being left with the skin . <p> Helen wrinkles up her nose . " Have you been smoking ? " <p> " Just a little . " <p> She takes the groceries from me and sets them on the ground , then lies down with her head in my lap . She looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she hugs my legs as if she 's right where she belongs . <p> " I did n't know she 'd be so heartbreaking , " she says . <p> Hearing her say this reminds me of a time in grade school when a girl in my class told me she 'd heard that twins had their hearts on opposite sides of their chests . I told her that did n't make any sense , so at recess my sister and I stood side by side for the girl who pushed her hair behind her ear and listened first to my chest , and then Helen 's , and back and forth for a full five minutes . Eventually she stood up . <p> " Yep . It 's opposite , all right , " she said , and ran off to jump rope . I started to join her until I saw that my sister was teary and looking down at the shirtfront covering the ribs and prepubescent nipples of her little girl chest . <p> " I want mine to be the same as yours , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recess in the library flipping through anatomy books , looking for some factoid that would calm her down . <p> Now I comb my sister 's hair with my fingers . " I guess I 'm over the heartbreaking part of it . I 'm just tired . " <p> But she does n't hear me . She 's fallen asleep , in this position , her knees practically shoved into her chin . <p> In my room , I open a window , and when the breeze from the Gulf rushes in , I hear a shiver from my bed . It is Bradley , curled up underneath my covers . <p> " What are you doing in here ? " I ask . <p> He rubs the underside of his nose but does n't open his eyes to talk . " My mom said I could sleep in here , with your pictures . " <p> By this he means the several dozen examples of children 's artwork that I have tacked to the bead-board walls . In one of my braver moments I ventured up to the attic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to happen , and there I found several boxes of ancient art projects my mother had collected from her kindergartners over the years : houses floating in the middle of the page as if filled with helium ; mothers and fathers with big heads and hairpin legs ; even a rudimentary dinosaur made with purple marker . <p> When I pulled the dinosaur picture out of the box , I could just see the dot of purple on the nose of this child , who could n't resist inhaling the artificially scented goodness of ink . I envisioned him shuffling over to my mother , her hair still worn about the shoulders , to offer up this token , this love letter , an apology for having torn the wings off a butterfly at recess . I could see all this because I had similar boxes in my own attic , suffered this same dilemma . I knew , then , when it came time , my sister would suggest we toss the boxes ; and despite my lack of interest in having them , I figured I would fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would win , and in addition to having the terrible burden of my own sentimental boxes of trash , I would inherit my mother 's sentimental boxes of trash , while my sister 's attic remained trash free . That 's when I pinned them all up to my bedroom walls . <p> " Scooch over , " I say , and he does , but barely . I have to spoon around him to get all of my body on the mattress . Normally , I do n't like to sleep this close to another person . On the rare occasions I let Marty , the twice-divorced phys. ed. teacher from my school , spend the night at my apartment , he 'd sling one of his hot , meaty limbs over me , and I 'd have to slither out from underneath and go camp out on my own couch just to get a few hours of sleep . But this-this is all right . <p> Now in my old wrought-iron bed , a bed nearly too small to share , I listen to him snore and watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like limpwristed waves good-bye of shy kindergartners . <p> In the morning Bradley is gone . When I check on my mother , she is crying . " I 'm sorry , " she says . <p> " It 's OK , " I tell her . I tuck her hair behind her ear to show her I mean it . <p> Shortly after the diagnosis , we visited a lawyer 's office to make arrangements for a living will and power of attorney . My mother and I watched a young woman change her infant 's diaper , right there in the waiting room . She whipped out a plastic mat , slid it under her child , and in three quick motions , the child was clean and dry . <p> Mama just stared . " That makes me ... all I 'm saying is , if it gets that bad , just shoot me in the head . " <p> I think ofthat , as I stroke the side of her face , near the temple , where I 'd have to put the bullet . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wipe down the vinyl cover , give her another bath , put her in a Hawaiian-print muumuu , and escort her to the kitchen table with the balled-up sheets in my hand . Helen puts the sheets in the washing machine , and I fix our mother some oatmeal and put water on to boil . <p> " I made some coffee , " Helen says . <p> " I drink tea . " <p> The boys sit at the table with our mother , coloring on sheets of construction paper . The stuffed dog is propped on the table , and Sasha is at my mother s feet . Helen and I stand against the counter . She clutches her mug in both hands . <p> " We meet with the realtor in an hour , " I say . " What do you want to do about the boys ? " <p> She shakes her head . " Not today . I 'm not ready . " <p> I close my eyes . It 's not time to force it yet . She 'll be here the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reschedule , " I say , and go see what the boys are coloring . Garrett 's picture has two stick-figure women that I presume are Helen and me . They are identical except for the heads ; the one who is supposed to be me has shorter , grayer hair . Fat red arrows circle around the women 's heads , reminding me of the illustrated diagrams in the science books I taught with in North Carolina . Photosynthesis . Condensation and precipitation . Metamorphosis . The cycles of life . <p> " Why the arrows ? " <p> Garrett does not look up from his paper . " My mom says that because you are twins , you can read each other 's minds . " <p> " She does , does she ? " <p> " Yep , " says Helen . " Twinnergy " She says it in such an earnest way that I have to smile . <p> The teakettle sounds . I pour my water before turning toward her . " Can you guess what I 'm thinking right now ? " <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her kids , it feels good . Both boys drop their crayons and look at her expectantly . After a moment squirming , she closes her eyes and gets down to business . It 's a convincing charade-her brow furrowed , lips rubbing together . If I did n't know better , I would think she was reading my mind . <p> " Your aunt is thinking , " she says , " that you are the best nephews in the whole world . " <p> Ouch . <p> Garret asks , " Is that what you were thinking ? " <p> I rub circles on his back . " Of course it is . " <p> " Look at my picture , " says Bradley , holding it over his head . A portrait of a dog-possibly Sasha , possibly the stuffed dog-takes up most of the page , but in the corner is a drawing of his grandmother wearing the muumuu . He must have been inspired when she entered the room . I can see how the muumuu would be good fodder for any child 's creativity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tugs on my mothers muumuu . " I like your dress , " he says . <p> " Fuck off , " she says , and pushes her oatmeal off the table . <p> I start giggling and it turns into a belly laugh-I do n't want to but I ca n't help myself . I 'm still laughing when Helen escorts the boys out of the room . I hear Bradley whisper up at his mother , " Grandma said ' fuck . ' " <p> I peek my head into the boys ' room , where Helen is helping them set up a board game . <p> " I put Grandma in her room , " I tell them . " She 's watching her shows , so she wo n't come out for a while . I 'm sorry she scared you . " <p> " She did n't scare me , " says Bradley . Garrett shuffles the cards and does n't look up . <p> " I 'm afraid I have n't been very much help to you this trip , have I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Yes . " <p> I hate to let my mother watch soap operas . She tends to confuse the shows with our lives and afterward accuses me of sleeping with her husband or trying to poison her . But when I return to her room , I think she looks somewhat grounded in the present , lying on top of the sheets , clutching Sasha close to her chest . I lie beside her on her bed , resting my head on the same pillow . For a minute , it feels the way it did when as girls , before Dad left , Helen and I would be startled by a noise or a shadow and get in the bed with our parents , the four of us squishing into the space , curling around each other like slugs under a rock . <p> My mother hugs the dog too tightly . Sasha squirms , but my mother only holds her closer . <p> " Let her go , " I say . " You 're hurting her . " <p> " She likes it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " No . " <p> The dog squeals before turning and sinking her teeth into my mother 's thin skin , then Sasha escapes from the room . I look at the wound . The teeth marks are visible , but the skin is not broken . My mother calls out for Sasha . I try to shush her . <p> " Just let her be , " I say . <p> " No ! " She pushes me away and hurries out the door . <p> I follow her to the boys ' room . The game board is on the floor , pieces strewn , cards dropped . Helen and the boys are standing , and I can just see Sasha peeking out from under the bed . <p> My mother puts her hands on her hips . " Where 's my dog ? " <p> " She 's not in here , " says Helen . " It 's just us . " <p> " I 'm not leaving without my dog . " <p> " I 'm sorry . We do n't have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . " I 'll find her in a minute . " <p> " No ! " She brushes my hand off my arm . " I want her now . " <p> I consider picking my mother up , tossing her over my shoulder and carrying her back to her room , but I 'm not sure I can manage it . <p> Garrett steps forward . " Here she is , " he says , thrusting his stuffed dog in front of him . " Here she is , Grandma . " <p> We all watch as my mother accepts the toy and cradles it in her arms . " There you are , Sasha . Why did you run away , you bad dog ? " <p> I look at Helen , who shrugs her shoulders , and lead my mother back to her room . <p> We make it through the rest of the day without incident . After the boys and our mother are asleep , Helen and I sit down at the table each with a glass of wine . <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Tomorrow ? Are you taking Mama ? " <p> " Not this week . I can come back in a month or so . " <p> I shake my head . " I ca n't wait that long . We can wait on the house , but not on Mama . " <p> " I ca n't do it , " she says , swirling her wine . " I 'm not ready . " <p> I pick up the bowl at the center of the table . The azaleas my sister cut and arranged the other night are already brown and curling . " It 's your turn , Helen . " <p> " It 's just so awful , " she says . " Please , give me a little while longer . I just need some time . " <p> " I do n't have time . " <p> " What do you mean , you do n't have time ? What do you have besides time ? You do n't have the boys to worry about . You do n't have Larry . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I do n't hurl the bowl at my sisters head . Instead , I carry it to the kitchen , grab the clippers and a basket , and head outside to clip some more of the azaleas , wondering how she could be so far off the mark . The truth is there has never been a circuit connecting us , fat red arrows circling from me to her and back again . Despite their genetic identity , our cells have always failed to communicate . <p> In the yard , I think , maybe I 'm not running out of time . Maybe my chances are over , and what 's left of my life is expendable . When I think about what I miss about my life before moving here , it is nothing that anyone other than myself could appreciate . I miss slinging my satchel , stuffed with graded papers and lesson plans , over my shoulder . I miss keeping a travel-sized bottle of my perfume in my purse , so when one of my girls told me how pretty I smelled , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . I miss Marty , a little . Yet I have no accomplishment from that life any greater than bringing about the triumphant return of my mother 's prized azaleas . I thought having my sister here would help to even things out a bit , would make it feel like the responsibilities , the hard decisions , and even the small pleasures , were split more equitably , but honestly , her presence has only made everything feel more lopsided , as if the heart that beats in my chest is not just on the opposite side , but also weighs an additional five pounds . <p> Before realizing what I 'm doing , I clip every flower off the bush in front of me . The branches jut out , spiky and bare , and my basket is overflowing with blooms . <p> " What are you doing ? " My sister is standing on the porch with my pack of smokes in her hand . She pulls one from the package with her lips and extends the pack toward me . I walk toward her and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat on the steps . <p> " I 'm clipping all the blooms off the azaleas . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because I feel like it . " <p> " Right . " <p> I have an urge to spit , to see if I can hit her between the eyes , but I do n't . <p> " Remember when Mama planted the azaleas ? " she asks me . <p> " How could I forget ? " <p> " How long had Dad been gone ? " <p> " No more than a week . " <p> " Remember the truck ? " she asked . <p> " Loaded down . " <p> " She worked all day , into the night . " <p> " So did I. " <p> My sister exhales . " Where was I ? " <p> I sit beside her on the steps , my basket of flowers at my feet , and say , " I do n't know . " <p> She is only halfway through her cigarette , while I am almost done . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't even complements . This is when I decide , despite myself , that I will do what I have always done . <p> " I 'm not going to wait to go back to North Carolina , " I say , " but I 'll take Mama with me . Temporarily , at least . " <p> Helen pats my hand in a slow , sad way that lets me know that this time , we read each other 's minds . Mine : There 's nothing temporary about it . She will die in North Carolina , far away from our father 's plot , from you , even from these azaleas . Hers : Do what you have to do . <p> The next morning I wake to find Helen loading up the minivan while Garrett sits in the swing , stroking Sasha . <p> " Thought we 'd get an early start , " says Helen . <p> Garrett smiles . " Mom says we can take Sasha with us . " <p> " Yes , " I say . " That 's a good idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , and I hold Sasha for him while Helen stacks the last of the bags and slams the back . Seconds later Garrett is back on the porch , wringing his hands . <p> " You better come see , Mom , " he says , and Helen and I exchange panicked looks and hurriedly follow Garrett to our mother 's room . <p> We stop short in the doorway . Bradley is there , standing at the foot of the bed , holding my empty basket in his hands . <p> " Is n't she beautiful ? " he asks . <p> Mama is still asleep , tucked just as tightly under her blanket as I left her last night , but now the bed is covered in pink and orange flowers . Bradley takes one of the flowers and tries to tuck it behind his grandmothers ear . She wakes at this , and when she sits up , a shower of azaleas tumble from the bed . <p> " Look , Grandma , " Bradley says . " Look . " <p> " It 's like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her ear . <p> He smiles his agreement . <p> After they are on the road , I get Mama some breakfast and help her settle in by the television . I let her hold the pack of cigarettes . Why the hell not ? <p> I start taking down the kindergartners ' pictures from my bedroom walls and notice a piece of tape stuck to the side of the dresser . On the tape is my name written in black permanent marker , in my mothers hand . I do n't know when she might have put this here , but I do n't have to look around to know that there will be pieces of tape-some with my name , some with Helen's-all over the house : behind the china cabinet , in a drawer of our grandmother 's secretary , underneath the chair to the kitchen table that was my fathers chair when he lived here and when he was a guest .
