<p> Josh Waitzkin 's new book , The Art of Learning : A Journey in the Pursuit of Excellence ( Free Press , $25 ) , describes his journey through chess to tai chi and his approach to peak performance . USA TODAY 's Tracey Wong Briggs reached him in the Bahamas . <p> Q : Why did you take up tai chi ? <p> A : Initially I was very drawn to the Tao Te Ching , the Taoist philosophy . It was helping me deal with the balance of these external and internal issues with my chess life . Tai chi is the martial embodiment of Taoist philosophy . Initially , I had no intention of competing in the martial arts ; it was just the meditation . <p> Q : You were national champion two years after taking up tai chi and world champion four years after that . What did you bring from chess that allowed you to become that good that quickly ? <p> A : One way of looking at that is through the idea of " numbers to leave numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the numbers of chess positions , so well that they leave your conscious mind and become instinctive ) . It started to feel as though I was just taking the essence of my chess understanding and making it manifest in the martial arts . <p> Q : How are your techniques applicable outside direct competition  --  say , writing a poem or playing the violin ? <p> A : I think my connecting those two arts is just an example that all arts can be connected . Principles of learning from anything can be applied to anything else . My relationship to these things is n't about the arts ; it 's not about chess or tai chi . It 's really about learning . <p> Q : You had a lot of aptitude for chess , but you also credit your success to how you were raised . What did your parents and teachers do right ? <p> A : Compared with many of the rivals I was competing against , I had the feeling they were much more naturally gifted than me . The thing that really separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that allowed me to pursue it in a beautiful way . <p> So many people are paralyzed by this ( perfectionist ) vision . Very gifted people , they win and they win , and they are told that they win because they are a winner . That seems like a positive thing to tell children , but ultimately , what that means is when they lose , it must make them a loser . I think that kind of fixed view of intelligence makes you brittle . It makes you unable to deal with inevitable setbacks . <p> For me , I think the best thing that ever happened was losing that first national championship game . It put me in a mini-crisis as a young boy  --  actually , for me , it did n't feel " mini "  --  but ultimately , when I won the nationals that followed , my relationship to success became about that process , the idea of having setbacks , overcoming them and ultimately succeeding . <p> My coach and my parents both had this relationship to what I was doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so I could love it . I had a passion for it . I was expressing myself through chess , and I was learning about myself through chess . <p> Q : A lot of your book is informed by Eastern thought . Why is this hard for Westerners ? Or is it hard for everyone ? <p> A : I do n't think it 's a Western-Eastern thing . When I 've competed in Taiwan , I 've been stunned by how many people are stuck ; they 're proclaiming themselves to be grand masters , but they have n't learned in 30 years . It 's easy to get stuck . Once we start to have success , it becomes easier to become kind of cemented in this perspective of who we are . <p> In America , people focus on the end result ; they focus on the star . Michael Jordan : They do n't focus so much on his journey as his knocking in that last-second shot to win the game in the playoffs , as opposed to all the hundreds of shots he missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team that ultimately made him the competitor he was . <p> Q : The highlight reel and not the whole game ? <p> A. Exactly . Or even more than the whole game , how about all the missed shots in the lowlight reel ? The lowlight reel is what makes the champion . That 's part of the reason that in the writing of the book , I was very true to the most painful moments of my life , because I think the long period of crisis I described toward the end of my chess life was defining to me . <p> A prodigy 's journey <p> Josh Waitzkin became a celebrity at 16 when the 1993 film Searching for Bobby Fischer told the chess champ 's story , from learning the game at 6 by playing street hustlers in New York City 's Washington Square Park to his first national title at 9 . <p> Thrust into the spotlight , Waitzkin tried to play up to others ' expectations , had trouble adjusting to a new coach and ultimately quit competitive chess in his early 20s . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took up tai chi at 21 and won two world championships six years later . Now 30 , he studies Brazilian jiu jitsu . <p> How not to be a pawn in life <p> In The Art of Learning , Josh Waitzkin combines memoir , performance psychology , Eastern thought and parenting . The book is in the self-help section of many bookstores , which makes him wary because instead of offering answers , he probes questions and ideas . <p> " I think a lot of self-help books are attempting to give easy answers to complex problems , " he says . " One thing I definitely struggled to do is to convey the complexity of these ideas . " <p> They include : <p> *Entity/incremental learning . Rather than treating intelligence or talent as a fixed " entity " that you have or you do n't , he stresses " incremental " progress through hard work . <p> * " Numbers to leave numbers . " By internalizing technical skills , such as the " numbers " of chess positions , you " leave " them to your subconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . <p> *The soft zone . Recalling intense periods of creative flow in which his performance was inspired and effortless , Waitzkin explores methods of creating inspiring conditions . Those include practicing stress and recovery to manage tension , figuring out what inspires serene focus and creating a routine to trigger that state . <p> *Investing in loss . Learning from your mistakes means accepting your imperfections and figuring out how to make them strengths . <p> *Making smaller circles . Rather than trying to master the big picture , concentrate on understanding the smallest fundamentals with such depth that they become part of your mental framework . <p> *Slowing down time . By training yourself to integrate information into your subconscious mind , you free your conscious mind to focus on smaller amounts of information in greater detail , making it feel as if time is slowing down . <p> *Making sandals . Rather than " paving the road , " or trying to control external conditions , you " make sandals , " or change the way you deal with those conditions . Instead of trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how to channel them in positive ways . <p> PHOTO , B/W
