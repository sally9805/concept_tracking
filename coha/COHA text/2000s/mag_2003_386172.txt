Section : NEWS &; TRENDS SLEEK , CAPACIOUS HARD DISKS ARE MAKING A NEW PLACE FOR THEMSELVES IN THE HOME AND ON THE ROAD . WE LOOK AT WHAT 'S HERE AND WHAT 'S NEXT . <p> IT 'S A HARD-DRIVE industry mantra : Each succeeding generation must be faster and fit more data into less space . But while performance gains have been modest recently , areal density ( gigabytes per square inch ) continues to grow . The result : roomy desktop drives , tiny portable hard drives that hold truly useful amounts of data , and other new products such as easy-to-install network-attached drives for homes and small businesses . And you can expect to see new functions and greater capacities in 2004 . <p> D-LINK 'S Central Home Drive device ( left ) and Ximeta 's NetDisk . LESS IS MORE <p> A COUPLE OF years ago , adding an external drive meant choosing between easily portable low-capacity models and bulky high-capacity units . But that has gradually changed as hard-drive makers squeeze additional storage into ever-shrinking forms . Consider the smaller-than-a-floppy Archos 20GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available ) . Based on Hitachi 's 1.8-inch DK14F1-20 mechanism and weighing only 2.7 ounces , this highly portable USB 2.0 drive sips power so parsimoniously that you usually do n't need its AC adapter : It can run off of USB power alone . LaCie uses Toshiba 's similar 20GB drive in its nearly-as-small Data Bank ( $299. find.pcworld.com/38633 ) , and the company plans to use Toshiba 's 40GB model in future Data Banks . <p> Though both the LaCie and the Archos run a bit warm in constant use , both units make a great higher-capacity alter native to flash memory drives for your sneakernet or commuter net . ( See " Little Drives , Big Promises " on page 32 for more about thumb drives . ) <p> Internal drives remain far more cost-effective , of course . And people who want capacities above today 's 300GB maximum wo n't have long to wait . Drive makers have announced technology ( or actual drives ) capable of raising areal density to permit drives of 400GB , 500GB , and even 1 terabyte in the next couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7200.7 SATA drive will ship before year 's end for about $200 . It utilizes a pair of double-sided platters ( each holding 100GB on board , up from 80GB ) ; this lowers the number of moving parts , increases reliability , and reduces overall drive costs for makers . Maxtur 's PMR technology can pack a whopping 175GB maximum per platter , but it is further from production ; the company has not released any specifics on drives using this technology . <p> ARCHOS 'S ARCDisk packs 20GB in the palm of your hand . NAS FOR HONE <p> RELATIVELY HIGH costs and complex setup formerly relegated network-attached storage ( external storage that you attach to a router or ethernet port instead of to a USB or FireWire port ) to a business-only product . No longer . New devices from vendors such as Ximeta and D-Link bring NAS to your home or small office , inviting you to add storage that ( unlike your PC 's local drive ) is accessible by anyone on the network , whether the PC is on or not . And it allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without so much as a glance at your screwdriver . <p> As more people put irreplaceable personal data onto their PCs ( you ca n't rebuild , say , a picture of your 5-year-old on a merry-go-round ) , regularly backing up becomes even more important , says David Reinsel , IDC research manager for hard drives . Consumer NAS fulfills that need . <p> Such products may also become central data repositories . Instead of buying a complex entertainment server , consumers may opt for simple-to-use drives for storing and sharing video files , music files , and other data everyone at home wants to access , Reinsel adds . <p> The 20GB D-Link Central Home Drive ( $249 ) uses Windows XP and Me 's Universal Plug and Play to make installation a one-step affair : Connect the drive to a router or network connection using an ethernet cable , turn it on , and  --  faster than you can say " file sharing "  --  it 's available via the Windows My Network Places icon . You do n't have to configure your router or even install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create and delete folders and set read/ write privileges , you must use a browser . Not to worry : We found the Web interface on our preproduction drive very easy and intuitive to use . Shipping units should be available by the time you read this ( find.pcworld.com/38639 ) . <p> Shipping now , Ximeta 's NetDisk home NAS drive ( find.pcworld.com/38642 ) is less expensive and comes in higher capacities ( 80GB for $190 , and 120GB for $230 ) , but it 's also a bit harder to set up . To enable reading and/or writing for every PC you wish to access the drive from , you 'll need to install a driver and client software , and then enter codes from a label on the bottom of the drive . Once you 've finished that step , however , you wo n't need to browse the network to access the Net Disk  --  it appears as a normal local internal or external drive within Windows Explorer . IN THE WORKS <p> THANKS TO FASTER maximum transfer rates and more-compact cabling , Serial ATA drives have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way to replacing PATA ( plain old or parallel ATA ) . Not content to rest on SATA 's laurels , the SATA II spec adds functions that should appear in drives within the next year . <p> The first new technology you 'll see for SATA is Native Command Queuing . ( A similar function has been available on SCSI and Fibre Channel products . ) With NCQ , SATA drives can execute and prioritize multiple read/write commands on their own , saving CPU cycles and storing or retrieving data faster . <p> Western Digital and Seagate have each demonstrated SATA drives with NCQ , and Seagate includes NCQ support in its Barracuda 7200.7 units . Still , you wo n't be able to use tile function until next year , when SATA chips and controllers implement it . Once that 's done , expect boosts to apps that access smaller files multiple times , like databases or contact managers . <p> Even better for IT and business types are SATA II 's port-selection and port-multiplying functions . With selection , several ( in current practice , two ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A SATA II port multiplier links to a SATA cable ( SATA 1.0 is one drive per port/cable ) and provides connections for multiple drives . This wo n't allow you to chain drives la USB or FireWire , but vendors like Maxtor have shown four drives running off a single port . <p> These technologies should debut by mid-2004 , says IDC 's Reinsel . Increasing SATA 's top transfer rate from 150 to 300 MBps will come later . <p> PATA drives will get boosts during the coming year , too , through ATA/7 ( the latest revision of the spec ) . Copping a page from Maxtor 's QuickView technology , which garnered the company a huge share of the drive-based digital video recorder market ( TiVo , ReplayTV , and the like ) , ATA/ 7 's T13 AV commands enable makers to ditch most of the error checking required by PC apps . A bad bit can crash executable programs or ruin data files , but it 's rarely perceptible in AV streams , so it makes sense to skip error correction and move on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new command set means more concurrent AV streams and reduced stress on the drive . <p> This probably wo n't be a user tweak : Drives will likely ship from makers to industry customers with error correction on or off . Reinsel says . <p> With vendors packing more bits and functions in , and with prices perpetually falling , bard disks continue to be one of the best values for upgraders . <p> By Jon L.
