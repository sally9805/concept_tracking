John Kerry offers his service in Vietnam as proof that he can keep America safe . But in two TV ads and a best-selling book , an anti-Kerry group has accused the Senator of dishonesty and cowardice during the war . Kerry hit back last week , accusing Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ( SBVT ) of doing the President 's dirty work . The Bush campaign denies a connection . SBVT 's biggest donor is Houston developer Bob Perry , who has given more than $4 million to Republicans , including Bush , and is a close friend of Bush adviser Karl Rove 's . Of SBVT 's 254 members , only one served on a boat Kerry commanded ; Kerry 's 10 other crewmates back him . Some group members say their real beef with Kerry is his antiwar activism , during which he testified to the Senate that " war crimes " by U.S. soldiers were common . He now says some of his remarks were excessive . Here 's a look at the group 's allegations .  --  By Mitch Frank <P> THE CHARGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SBVT alleges that the wound was a minor , self-inflicted scratch . Kerry says on Dec. 2 , 1968 , he and his two crewmates that night fired on men on a riverbank . It 's unclear if someone fired back , but shrapnel hit Kerry 's arm . Louis Letson , a medical officer at the time , says that he treated Kerry 's wound and that it was too small to justify a medal . William Schacte Jr . says he was on the boat that night and there was no enemy fire ; he says Kerry was injured by a grenade Kerry himself launched . <P> THE EVIDENCE Kerry 's medical record was signed not by Letson but by corpsman J.C . Carreon . Letson claims Carreon routinely signed forms for him . Letson told the Los Angeles Times he heard the wound was self-inflicted thirdhand  --  from his subordinates , who heard it from Kerry 's two crewmates . They deny saying that and insist Schacte was n't on the boat that night . The military grants a Purple Heart for any wound requiring medical attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CHARGE Kerry lied to win his Silver Star . SBVT charges that Kerry exaggerated his role in a battle on Feb. 28 , 1969 . In charge of a three-boat patrol that was ambushed , Kerry ordered the boats to beach in front of their attackers and engage them head on . Kerry 's boat was providing cover when a rocket hit it . Kerry jumped ashore to chase a Viet Cong with a rocket launcher and killed him . SBVT says Kerry simply shot a wounded teenager in the back . Former Lieut . Commander George Elliott , Kerry 's direct superior , said in a recent affidavit that he would n't have awarded Kerry a Silver Star if he had known the details . <P> THE EVIDENCE Kerry 's crewmates say the boat was in clear danger . Besides , Kerry won the medal for leadership during the whole battle , and Elliott describes the entire episode in the citation he wrote . Elliott later told the Boston Globe he had made a terrible mistake in signing the affidavit . Then he signed a new affidavit standing behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 , Elliott went to Boston to uphold it . The commander of one of the other two boats , Chicago Tribune editor William Rood , corroborated Kerry 's story last week .
