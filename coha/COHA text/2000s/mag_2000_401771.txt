One of our greatest aviators revealed just what went on in his own mind when he " went forth to kill " in World War II . Here , intimately exposed , are the innermost <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE : The Post first published this article in its October 2 , 1954 , issue . During World War H , Charles Lindbergh flew many combat missions in the Pacific Theater . <p> Guns charged and ring sights glowing , our four Corsairs float like hawks over enemy-held land . Below us are the jungle hills of New Ireland ; ahead , the purple volcanoes of Rabaul . Elsewhere , our eyes see a wilderness of cloud , sky , and blue Pacific water . <p> We are cruising at 8,000 feet , on a marine patrol , to cover the morning 's strike , to make sure that Japanese Zeros do n't interfere with American bombing crews . Our planes are from VMF 223 , based on a rolled-coral strip in the Green Islands  --  200 miles east of New Guinea  --  four degrees south of the equator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore unlike all other flights . My senses are peeled of the calluses formed by everyday routine . They awoke this morning with new awareness , crying out that I 'll go forth to kill , and to run the risk of death ; that , like man of primitive times , I 'm both the hunter and the hunted . Inside this sun-browned skin that covers me , civilized perception and barbaric instinct are melting into some not-yet-tested out alloy . Ever since my ears heard the noises of daybreak , all things around me  --  the air I breathe , the ground I walk on , the very trees of the jungle  --  seem to have taken on new qualities of beauty and of danger . <p> There was the graceful curve of my fighter 's wing , as I climbed into the cockpit before take-off , testifying to the godlike creativeness of man . There was the awkward bulk of my pistol , digging into my chest , reminding me of our satanical destructiveness . I watched the bunched heads of coconut palms streaming past as my landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by antiaircraft cannon at the strip 's end . After that , the power of 2,000 horses pulled me skyward to aviation 's supermortal view , until a voice in my receiver shouted , " Clear your guns ! " <p> Now , we are spread wide  --  the four of us  --  in combat formation , so we 'll have room to maneuver in attack . At the foot of those hills below , hidden in that thick jungle mat of leaves and branches , are our enemies  --  men of different language and ideas , but with bodies and brains quite similar to ours . We know that their glasses are now trained upon us , that their loaded batteries will anticipate our course . At any moment puffs of black may shatter this crystal air . We are like the animals in that jungle  --  nerved to spring upon our prey ; alert lest we be sprung on . One shot , and a Corsair may fall , like a feathered bird to an expert marksman . One swoop , and a dozen Japanese may lie dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I carry , of .50-caliber ammunition , and I can spew them out at the rate of 5,000 rounds a minute . Suddenly the grace of flight is gone . I see with war-conditioned eyes  --  these are wicked-looking planes we fly , manned by ruthless pilots , built to kill , trained to kill , hoping to kill , as we approach the heavily defended fortress of Rabaul . <p> At 10,000 feet , we tilt our wings and circle the bomb-pocked city . I see that its harbor is reefed with sunken ships  --  monuments to strikes that came before us . A single burst of ack-ack , high and wide , announces our arrival . The enemy is not wasting ammunition on patrolling fighters , and it 's doubtful that he has enough Zeros left to put a squadron up . We range over the nearby Japanese airstrips ; a few planes are in the revetments , but we see no sign of activity on the ground . <p> Army B-25 's are bunched closely in the sky above us . Navy torpedo-bombers are coming in from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike has begun . Airacobras , at much lower altitude , dive on their targets . Black puffs of ack-ack spatter the air . <p> One of our Corsairs reports a " bogey " at seven o'clock , low . We bank , nose down , and arm our guns . It 's a twin-engine plane , American , the circled star is clear upon each wing . We pull out of our dives , spiral upward . I see an outskirt of Rabaul erupting like a new volcano  --  bombs from the B-25 's have hit . The radio is full of chatter : a life raft has been reported on the water , fighters are already circling above it , and a " Dumbo " flying boat is coming in to rescue the downed man . <p> We swing southward . Columns of smoke and flame from magnesium clusters mushroom up in a grove of coconut palms  --  an enemy fuel dump was there . I see a TBF making its getaway , low over the water , while a shore battery 's splashes follow it out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's only a P-39 , strayed from the flock , somewhat nervous lest we mistake it for a Zero . <p> The B-25 's have disappeared . Several fork-tailed Lightnings pass above us . I watch the torpedo-bombers re-forming out at sea . A trail of smoke marks one which has been hit ; it will probably have to ditch on the way home . <p> The strike is over ; the air above Rabaul deserted ; old ack-ack bursts grow large and haze away . On the ground a dozen fires are burning . Now our secondary mission will begin . Since our ammunition boxes are still full , we have targets to strafe  --  long wooden buildings surrounded by palm trees . The flashes of guns were reported near them during a previous raid . We take up an angular course which may throw the defenders off guard , fly on beyond , whip into position , set our trim tabs for a dive . I reach down and purge my wing tanks . <p> Seven thousand feet . . . 5,000 feet . . . 4,000 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us . . . 3,000 feet . . . perfect range , but a Corsair is too close to my line of fire . . . 2,000 feet . . . buildings and palms rush up at me . . . 1,500 feet . . . the Corsair ahead pulls away , and I squeeze the trigger . <p> Six guns clatter in my plane as tracers streak from wings to roof , and walk the building 's length . I level out 20 feet above the treetops at 400 miles an hour . All this is forbidden land , just over a wing span beneath me , apparently deserted by life ; actually full of watching eyes , and hands that would gladly feel a bayonet pierce through my belly . An airstrip lies ahead  --  probably bristling with machine guns . We bank toward the sea , flash past the shore line , hold low until we are out of range of anti-aircraft cannon . <p> It 's almost 11 o'clock . In eight more minutes a patrol of freshly fueled Corsairs will appear overhead to relieve us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of ammunition left  --  that means we 'll drop in on the Duke of York before returning home . <p> The Duke of York is an island lying in the channel between New Britain and New Ireland . A Japanese airstrip has been built on it . Near the strip are several small villages in which , our intelligence reports , enemy troops are quartered . Patrol planes have been instructed to keep these villages well strafed and to be on the alert for ground guns . How about the natives ? " They took to the hills long ago . Besides , they 're all unfriendly on New Ireland . Do n't forget what happened to those pilots they turned over to the Nips . " <p> We come in low above the palms and zoom 500 feet to start our runs . I get a row of huts in my sight and rake through them as I pull my nose up . . . dust rising . . . fragments flying . . . incendiaries ricocheting at all angles . . . watch the palms . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving at five miles a minute . . . level off . . . bank left . . . hug the ground so Japanese guns ca n't follow you . <p> We break formation . Now each plane is on its own , to harass the enemy . <p> My heading takes me out to sea . I swing back toward the coast . A thatch-walled structure perches on a cliff ; beside it are steel barrels . I let my bullets rip through air until I 'm 100 yards away . . . chandelle to miss the palm tops . . . bank left . . . another row of huts . . . nose down . . . too close . . . only a short burst before I have to pull the stick back . . . circle toward the airstrip . . . two Corsairs diving on my right . . . dust . . . tracers . . . incendiaries . <p> I climb to locate my position . . . dive to evade enemy machine guns . . . center a building in my sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . a steeple ! . . . a church ! . . . hold fire . . . ease back on the stick . . . pick out another target . . . dive . . . fire . . . ammunition almost gone . . . only one machine gun answers . . . Corsairs are rendezvousing out at sea . I join them . <p> " Onyx 12  --  Onyx 12 . " That 's our radio call . The message comes in clearly , " Sweep St. George Channel for a rubber boat . " We spread out 1,000 yards apart and fly 500 feet above the water . A moment ago our mission was to kill ; now it is to rescue . Some American plane is missing , and some report said it was last seen above this channel . We find nothing  --  take up our homeward course . Flying boats will continue the search . <p> We tighten to parade formation as we approach the Green Islands . Right echelon for peel off . . . one . . . two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for landing . . . gear down . . . flaps down . . . canopy wide open . My wheels touch ground at 12:20 , local time ; it 's been a three-hour-and-40-minute mission . <p> Other planes warm up as we taxi in . A new strike is getting under way . <p> Leaf points of a coconut palm spear into the Southern Cross . A Marauder bomber drones off through distant night . The roaring fury of our war is replaced by damp , tropical silence . I smear bug repellent around my neck , and sit down on a grenade box . I ca n't wipe the vision of that church from my mind . Steeples do n't fit into gun sights . Thoughts of God are antagonistic to the thoughts of war . <p> " I almost shot up a church today , " I told a young marine captain after we landed . " I just recognized what it was in time . " <p> " Oh , you mean that little church on the Duke of York ? " He laughed . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it for their troops . " <p> I suppose our enemies say the same about churches they destroy . Both sides find excuses for doing anything in battle , and the other fellow always commits the first atrocity . When you shoot a Jap trying to surrender , it 's because some other Jap , apparently surrendering , tossed a hand grenade instead  --  " the rats will kill you if you give ' em half a chance . " One incident has led to another , until ground guns flash in church windows , and tracers streak through air in quick reply . If you 're captured in enemy territory , " the Nips just chop your head off , " and , on our side , " the boys do n't take prisoners any more . " <p> If God has the power over man claimed by his Disciples , why does He permit the strafing of churches and the atrocities of war ? How can one return from battle and believe that an all-powerful God desires " peace on earth , good will toward men " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions the very existence of God . <p> A breath of wind flutters palm leaves . Waves of the Pacific break softly off the island shore . My thoughts drift halfway around the world to America and home . I find it hard to place myself in space and time . My family is almost upside-down from me , with day , instead of night , approaching . Bloomfield Hills is not in the direction my arm would point , toward a northeasterly horizon ; it 's really down beneath my feet . I imagine looking through earth and distance , at the soles of my children 's shoes . The flat state of Michigan bulges convex on a planet 's surface , and my long route across the ocean becomes a great circle on a sphere . <p> But this moist ground my feet are touching is not , in childhood 's sense , beneath me ; it 's a vertical wall of earth , rotating at a thousand miles an hour around an axis capped by frozen poles . Only a mysterious force named gravity gives me the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tumbling downward  --  tumbling toward what star ? Which way is up , which down , in the vastness of the heavens ? Up for my children and up for me are now opposite directions . There 's no universal plane of reference from which to judge ; planets spinning around balls of fire , suns rushing with celestial speeds  --  rushing where ? Do they hurtle on forever ? Do they follow some tremendous orbit of their own ? How can the universe be endless ? But what could lie beyond its end ? <p> I look out into trackless spaces where light , leaping to the moon while a human step is taken , travels for billions of years between galaxies of stars , where the entire span of life on earth forms but a moment of celestial time ; where there 's heat to vaporize carbon , cold to liquefy air , nothingness beyond measure , substance from which world and man have come . How was this universe created ? What made the laws by which it runs  --  the mathematical perfection , the complexity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single atom , the triviality of a thousand stars ? In space there 's clarity which lets me see through ages , and there 's mystery opaque to my brain . Here , now , I 'm confined to my body , but when I think of my family , some element within me exists 10,000 miles away . I feel dwarfed by the entire concept , as an ant is dwarfed by the being and intelligence of man . <p> Are humans severely limited in comprehension , too , like the insects that crawl and buzz around me ? Does understanding expand forever , like space , while life develops into higher forms ? And if there 's a graduated scale of awareness , what mark have humans reached ? In magnitude of mind and shape , does the difference between man and insect point toward the difference between man and God ? Maybe God ca n't be reached by worldly measures ; maybe He prefers no shape , no tangibility at all . <p> But whether one attributes them to God , nature , or some other name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the orbits of the heavens , in earth 's gravitation , in the existence of human eye and mind . The endlessness of space is no more astounding than the domed ocean holding to , its bed or the reproduction of new generations through the ova and the sperm . <p> An engine coughs and roars through night . Some crew chief is readying his fighter for tomorrow 's strike . I get up from the grenade box and begin walking toward my tent . Where , in life and space and matter , is the place for war ? How can one justify a church in a gun sight ? How can one merge concepts of religion and of slaughter ? Is strife an essential part of the universal plan , or will man , evolving , find a path which leads to world-wide peace ? <p> Lindbergh as a technical representative in the Pacific during WWII . <p> Lindbergh ( second from left ) also flew , in an unofficial capacity , on 50 bombing missions .
