Chapter One : In Which the Grace Children Get Aquainted with Their New Home If someone had asked Jared Grace what jobs his brother and sister would have when they grew up , he would have had no trouble replying . He would have said that his brother , Simon , would be either a veterinarian or a lion tamer . He would have said that his sister , Mallory , would either be an Olympic fencer or in jail for stabbing someone with a sword . But he could n't say what job he would grow up to have . Not that anyone asked him . Not that anyone asked his opinion on anything at all . The new house , for instance . Jared Grace looked up at it and squinted . Maybe it would look better blurry . " It 's a shack , " Mallory said , getting out of the station wagon . It was n't really , though . It was more like a dozen shacks had been piled on top of one another . There were several chimneys , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence sitting on the roof like a particularly garish hat . " It 's not so bad , " their mother said , with a smile that looked only slightly forced . " It 's Victorian . " Simon , Jared 's identical twin , did n't look upset . He was probably thinking of all the animals he could have now . Actually , considering what he 'd packed into their tiny bedroom in New York , Jared figured it would take a lot of rabbits and hedgehogs and whatever else was out here to satisfy Simon . " Come on , Jared , " Simon called . Jared realized that they had all crossed to the front steps and he was alone on the lawn , staring at the house . The doors were a faded gray , worn with age . The only traces of paint were an indeterminate cream , stuck deep in crevices and around the hinges . A rusted ram's-head door knocker hung from a single , heavy nail at its center . Their mother fit a jagged key into the lock , turned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened into a dim hallway . The only window was halfway up the stairs , and its stained glass panes gave the walls an eerie , reddish glow . " It 's just like I remember , " she said , smiling . " Only crappier , " said Mallory . Their mother sighed but did n't otherwise respond . The hallway led into a dining room . A long table with faded water spots was the only piece of furniture . The plaster ceiling was cracked in places and a chandelier hung from frayed wires . " Why do n't you three start bringing things in from the car ? " their mother said . " Into here ? " Jared asked . " Yes , into here . " Their mother put down her suitcase on the table , ignoring the eruption of dust . " If your great-aunt Lucinda had n't let us stay , I do n't know where we would have gone . We should be grateful . " None of them said anything . Try as he might , Jared did n't feel anything close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything had gone bad . He 'd messed up at school , and the fading bruise over his left eye would n't let him forget it . But this place  --  this place was the worst yet . " Jared , " his mother said as he turned to follow Simon out to unload the car . " What ? " His mother waited until the other two were down the hall before she spoke . " This is a chance to start over ... for all of us . Okay ? " Jared nodded grudgingly . He did n't need her to say the rest of it  --  that the only reason he had n't gotten kicked out of school was because they were moving anyway . Another reason he was supposed to be grateful . Only he was n't . Outside , Mallory had stacked two suitcases on top of a steamer trunk . " I heard she 's starving herself to death . " " Aunt Lucinda ? She 's just old , " said Simon . " Old and crazy . " But Mallory shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telling Uncle Terrence that Aunt Lucy thinks little men bring her food . " " What do you expect ? She 's in a nuthouse , " Jared said . Mallory went on like she had n't heard him . " She told the doctors the food she got was better than anything they 'd ever taste . " " You 're making that up . " Simon crawled into the backseat and opened one of the suitcases . Mallory shrugged . " If she dies , this place is going to get inherited by someone , and we 're going to have to move again . " " Maybe we can go back to the city , " Jared said . " Fat chance , " said Simon . He took out a wad of tube socks . " Oh , no ! Jeffrey and Lemondrop chewed their way loose ! " " Mom told you not to bring the mice , " Mallory said . " She said you could have normal animals now . " " If I let them go , they 'd get stuck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning a sock inside out , one finger sticking out a hole . " Besides , you brought all your fencing junk ! " " It 's not junk , " Mallory growled . " And it 's not alive . " " Shut up ! " Jared took a step toward his sister . " Just because you 've got one black eye does n't mean I ca n't give you another one . " Mallory flipped her ponytail as she turned toward him . She shoved a heavy suitcase into his hands . " Go ahead and carry that if you 're so tough . " Even though Jared knew he might be bigger and stronger than her someday  --  when she was n't thirteen and he was n't nine  --  it was hard to picture . Jared managed to lug the suitcase inside the door before he dropped it . He figured he could drag it the rest of the way if he had to and no one would be the wiser . Alone in the hallway of the house , however , Jared no longer remembered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split off this one , winding deep into the middle of the house . " Mom ? " Although he 'd meant to call out loudly , his voice sounded very soft , even to himself . No answer . He took a tentative step and then another , until the creak of a board under his feet stopped him . Just as he paused , something inside the wall rustled . He could hear it scrabbling upward , until the sound disappeared past the ceiling . His heart beat hard against his chest . It 's probably just a squirrel , he told himself . After all , the house looked like it was falling apart . Anything could be living inside ; they 'd be lucky if there was n't a bear in the basement and birds in all the heating ducts . That was , if the place even had heat . " Mom ? " he said again , even more faintly . Then the door behind him opened and Simon came in , carrying mason jars with two bug-eyed gray mice in them . Mallory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jared said . " In the wall . " " What ? " Simon asked . " I do n't know .... " Jared did n't want to admit that for a moment he 'd thought it was a ghost . " Probably a squirrel . " Simon looked at the wall with interest . Brocaded gold wallpaper hung limply , peeling and pocking in places . " You think so ? In the house ? I always wanted a squirrel . " No one seemed to think that something in the walls was anything to worry about , so Jared did n't say anything more about it . But as he carried the suitcase to the dining room , Jared could n't help thinking about their tiny apartment in New York and their family before the divorce . He wished this was some kind of gimmicky vacation and not real life .
