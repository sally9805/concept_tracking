/Jan 2000 Uncle Rudolph is a drunk , your parents are frosty and you 'd like to deck the halls with cousin Holly . And now you 're all getting together for the holidays ... In the storybooks it 's always snowflakes , sweet times and warm , cozy gatherings with nary a nasty word . And for some lucky folks , family festivities end as happily as a fairy tale . Then there are the rest of us . The ones from whom the Brothers Grimm drew inspiration . We may not want to admit it lest we be branded a Grinch , but many of us look forward to the holidays with the same good cheer we take to the dentist : We know we 've got to do it , but our first instinct is to run . To Peru . Or Iceland . Or under the bed . Before you crawl under the mattress , remember that you 're not alone in struggling to balance your angst with being a responsible parent . Should you attempt to explain your family 's troubles to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry under the mistletoe ? What 's a parent to do when it is n't all tinsel and twinkle ? Though the holidays had never been easy , when she became a mother , Amy Whitman ( f. * ) of Toronto wanted to provide the " perfect traditional day " for her son 's first Christmas . She figured hosting the day on her own turf might make a difference , and with great hopes invited everyone for dinner . " It was a tremendous disappointment , " she recalls with a shiver . " My brothers and sisters all fought , my parents were distant and the baby was oblivious to the whole situation . " She vowed never to have Christmas with her side of the family again . Whitman thought only occasional contact and an increased reliance on her husband 's family would make up for what she terms " the void . " Then her son turned three . Along with his entry into preschool came lots of questions near holiday time , including the dreaded " Are we going to see Grandma and Grandpa on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Whitman was seeing a therapist and , armed with some objective advice , realized that she did n't want to rob her son of a relationship with his grandparents . She decided her son would see them , " but not on Christmas Day , and only for an hour . " Four years later these brief , cordial and businesslike little visits now occur near her son 's birthday as well . Whitman is cautiously keeping the door open , though she swears she will never , ever have another family dinner . Questions do sporadically pop up about the aunts , uncles and cousins that her son does not see , particularly when he and his friends start discussing holiday plans . As he grows , his questions become more elaborate and she is forced to expand her answers . " For now , he is content with the pattern and the twice-yearly meetings . He rips open his presents and takes off . " During these visits she and her parents do n't touch on anything that is hurtful or intimate . " It 's not perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's the best we can do for now . " " Creating boundaries is a good way to maintain your sanity and keep connected , " says Barbara Dyszuk , a therapist and family-life education coordinator in Waterloo , Ontario . " Parents in these situations are in such chaos themselves that they sometimes forget that this also affects their child . There are few cases where it is not in the best interests of the child to be in the family . " Dyszuk insists that all kids need the connections , the security and the grounding that extended relationships bring . If face-to-face contact is not workable , she suggests trying letters , phone calls or visits accompanied by other family members or friends . OK . So you want to do the right thing and admit that you ca n't stand cousin Stella " cause she slept with the only man you ever really loved . When is telling your child the sordid details of your family an enlightenment , and when is it a millstone ? How far should you go ? And what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening  --  really listening  --  to your child . " Get clarification before you start to spill out information . " She compares it to the sex question . " ' Where do I come from ? " can just as easily be a question of which town was I born in than a request for a lesson on human reproduction . " For all ages , she suggests that a parent answer the question , but not share all the gory details unless the child specifically asks . But what if she does want to know all ? Dyszuk says it can be a difficult dance because you have to take care not to burden your child with your own need for emotional support , while also sharing your true feelings . " You do n't want your child becoming the little adult , taking on too much responsibility at too young an age . You have to remember that these people are still significant to your child . You have to separate your relationship with that person from that of your child . " In other words , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a parent in crisis , but stresses that children require real answers without the sugar-coating . " For kids , the main problem is fear of the unknown . They are probably already aware that something is n't quite right . " She suggests something like : " I was sad because they said hurtful things to me . " If your child rushes to your defence and says that he hates those people too , try : " I appreciate that you are saying that because you love me , but hurt is a normal feeling . " A child needs to get these protective feelings out , " but it 's not OK to put other people down in the process . " Dyszuk urges parents and kids to explore words like frustrated , nervous and uncomfortable  --  after all , there is a wide range of emotions between happy and sad . Words like mixed up and confused are great ones to play with because they express more than one emotion at a time , something Dyszuk says can be frightening to a child . Talking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . Once you 've acknowledged and dealt with your child 's growing awareness of your family 's situation , you 're on the road toward devising strategies for getting through tough family visits . If Chanukah at Aunt Sally 's was a disaster last year , there is a good bet it will be again . Says Dyszuk , " Try , " I can see why you do n't want to go back to Aunt Sally 's , but we have to . Let 's talk about how we can handle this . ' ' " Parents like Whitman need ways to cope with big problems , but what if your family is n't absent or a disaster , and it 's just little squabbles that needle you ? Like slap-happy Uncle Harry who pinches your kids ' cheeks like a vice , or cousin Clara who cleaves the little ones a little too tightly to her overly perfumed and ample bosom ? You love to see them , but by dessert you 're twitching like a cat in a light socket . " Deal with it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynn , adding that this pertains to older kids , not toddlers who need to be protected . " So they hate it when Uncle Harry pinches their cheeks . It 's not the end of the world . " Lynn says parents have to realize that not everything that happens to their children will scar them for life . " It boils down to teaching your child how to act in a social context and developing plain old good manners . " Being pleasant about something you do n't want to do , or someone you do n't want to see , is part of life , says Lynn . " Life is n't easy all the time and we do our children a disservice if we try to protect them from all this stuff . The " I do n't feel like it so I do n't have to do it ' school of thought is self-centred and does n't consider that there are other people involved . " Lynn agrees that discussion ahead of time is a good idea . " Kids need permission to talk about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution . Got a cheek-pincher or a too-tight-hugger in the family ? Teach your kids to establish clear eye contact , keep an arm's-length distance , shake the relative 's hand and then step back . " It solves the problem , is appropriate and it 's good manners , " says Lynn . Teaching kids to be gracious when they get a dorky gift is also important , says Lynn . Even if they hate it , coach them to say thank you for the thought . One sibling gets a better gift than the other ? Do n't try to fix it , just counsel her to accept it . If it is a perennial problem , phone Uncle Dave in October and tactfully say , " Sarah is really changing her likes and dislikes at this age . Would you like some suggestions for gifts ? " Lynn says it 's all about giving your relative the benefit of the doubt . " After all , nobody sets out to give a bad gift . " Lorne Melhurst ( f. * ) of Edmonton would disagree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a " reasonable " relationship with his mother , who he suspects " has never really accepted my wife , a lawyer , who is as non-traditional in domestic stuff as my mother is traditional . " For the past three years , his daughter has received a silver teaspoon for Christmas , a gift that Melhurst is finding harder and harder to take . He fears that this year he is going to blow his top when his daughter receives yet another piece " for her dowry . " Melhurst says his wife smiles while his daughter looks confused , but he just burns . He 's tried to tactfully broach the conversation but says his mother is firm " that my little girl needs to build her silverware . " Is the silver teaspoon a passive-aggressive shot or merely an old-fashioned but well-meaning gesture of love ? It all depends on your point of view . And your bottom line , says Kathy Lynn . " He has to decide if the relationship with the grandmother is more important than the gift . " Lynn herself drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was an issue so important to us that if it strained a family relationship , it was well worth it . " But a silver spoon ? " It seems so petty with all the things that we have to worry about . Figure out something to do with the damn spoon and get on with your life . " " Try dealing with it with humour , " suggests Lee Horton , a Cambridge , Ontario family therapist . " Imagine what they 'd look like hanging off the tree as decorations , or on Grammy 's ears , or whatever . Think about a really silly use for them in your head . " She says Melhurst could keep the joke to himself or share it later with his wife , but should be careful what he says to his daughter . " You never know , his daughter might really like the teaspoons . " We all need to ease our own expectations . " We put so much pressure on one day to be fabulous and it is so unrealistic , " says Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you 'd ever do it again , and then it 's a horrible cycle . " She acknowledges that we need the sense of continuity that tradition and ritual give us , " but no one can possibly live up to all the hype . " Stepfamilies in particular struggle with this each year when they try to blend old and new traditions . The solution ? " Create other traditions . Or space them throughout the season , but not all on the same day . " Lynn suggests asking your kids what matters most to them during the holidays and getting them actively involved in what makes their season bright . And most of all , relax . Be a little more resilient . After all , it 's cheaper than a trip to Peru . And who knows ? You might come up with some brilliant uses for that burgeoning collection of silver teaspoons . * Names changed by request . <p>
