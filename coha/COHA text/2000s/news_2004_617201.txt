<p> Even in the middle of their divorce , Jeff " Jay " McCann and Heather Rees kept one vow : Never fight in front of the children . <p> Instead , they sparred on paper , back and forth , in a blue spiral notebook . <p> " It gave me the chance to see what he was thinking , " Rees said , " and there were no faces being made , no tone . " <p> Seven years later , McCann coaches their 9-year-old 's church basketball team . Rees is the team mom . Oh , and Rees ' current husband , Phil , also coaches the team . <p> The team , decked out in blue and white , is called Magic . Many would call the relationship between these three the same thing  --  a vision of harmony rarely seen in the wake of a divorce . <p> " Everyone is willing to overlook their personal stuff for the benefit of the children , " said Rees , a stay-at-home mom . <p> That 's how it should be , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain civility . <p> Now , in an effort to get more parents to " play nice , " government and private programs are aggressively reaching out to splitting couples and their kids to stop the often messy aftermath of divorce . <p> From mandated seminars to mediation to support groups for children , Georgia 's judges , social workers and child experts are concentrating on helping divorced families communicate and collaborate better . <p> A lot is at stake : Statistically , children from divorced homes are at higher risk for violence , depression , substance abuse and poor school performance . <p> And according to a 2001 study , one in three children reported that they were still embroiled in the bitterness between battling parents five years after a divorce . <p> The study , published in the Journal of the American Board of Family Practice , also found that half of the women and one-third of the men were still intensely angry at their former spouses a decade after a divorce . <p> " These programs and things enable people to cut through the curtain of emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move toward a partnership , " said Margot Swann of Visions Anew , a nonprofit divorce recovery organization . <p> ' 1,000 knives ' <p> Divorcing parents nearly fill the 50 chocolate-colored seats at a jury assembly room at Cobb County Superior Court . <p> On this chilly , foggy January day , many appear tired ; eyes red and hands clasping paper coffee cups out of a vending machine . In metro Atlanta , it 's a common scene every week . Hundreds of parents file in for this seminar , required in Cobb before the judge will finalize a divorce . <p> Many participants seem emotionless during the program until social worker Rosemary Wachtel holds up a drawing made by a small child . <p> " Divorce is like getting stabbed by 1,000 knives , " the child had written in black marker above a red stick figure . Another drawing depicts a small child holding a bomb . <p> Some of the parents drop their heads and weep . <p> The pictures are an effective tool , and Wachtel is hoping to reach these parents . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these parents to use common sense and courtesy when speaking to their ex-spouse . <p> Wachtel holds up another picture of a tree with a line down the middle . One half is the mom , the other the dad . <p> " And the child asks , ' How can I be good for something if my mom is good for nothing ? ' " <p> Everyday reality <p> In America , divorce becomes a part of everyday life for 1.5 million children annually . <p> About 69 percent of children are living with married parents , down from 85 percent in 1970 , according to the State of Our Unions 2003 by the National Marriage Project . <p> In the face of such statistics , researchers are exploring which children seem to survive  --  even thrive  --  after a divorce . <p> While most children adapt well , between 20 percent and 25 percent suffer significant adjustment problems , such as depression and substance abuse , as teenagers , according to the National Institute of Mental Health . <p> Wake Forest University professor of psychology Christy Buchanan has studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . <p> A key predictor of depression in children , she said , is the feeling of being caught between their parents  --  from the constant quizzing from house to house to even being asked whom they like more . <p> " Whatever the level of conflict or hostility you feel toward your ex-spouse , " Buchanan said , " try to isolate it so the children are not drawn into it . " <p> LeAnne Benfield , a 37-year-old free-lance writer who lives in Suwanee , said the mandatory parenting seminar in Gwinnett County and support groups at her church have helped her carve out an upbeat , child-focused relationship with her ex-husband . <p> " When her dad is coming to pick her up , she gets so excited , and I will say , ' Daddy 's here ! Daddy 's here ! ' and it 's not fake . I am celebrating with her . I do it for her , not for him , " said Benfield . She said she almost always communicates with her ex-husband via e-mail because it is less emotional for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently remarried , said he and his new wife also make sure to speak favorably of his ex-wife with 4-year-old Madeline . <p> " We are not vindictive or spiteful people , and we are both very dedicated to Madeline , so I really could n't see it going any other way , " Benfield said . <p> David Alexander , an Atlanta child specialist who works in mediation , said such maturity of communication between parents is key . <p> " The better the quality , " he said , " the better the prognosis . " <p> A new approach to divorce <p> Atlanta family law attorney Lauren Alexander ( no relation to David Alexander ) remembers helplessly watching an involved and loving father lose a bitter custody battle . It was a turning point : She decided her life as a litigator was over . <p> Alexander now practices only " collaborative " law , a radically different approach to divorce . <p> Collaborative law is a fledgling practice in Georgia , with its first trained lawyer arriving here just five years ago . Now more than 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach requires divorcing parents and their attorneys to meet face to face , pool resources for child specialists and voluntarily provide financial records . <p> The approach is not for everyone . Besides the parties ' signing an agreement saying they will not go to court , collaboration calls for a spirit of goodwill and several goal-oriented meetings . <p> " If you have a couple who is so invested in fighting , collaborative is not appropriate , " said Diane Woods , a Marietta family law attorney who does both traditional and collaborative divorces . <p> Phil and Bronwyn Sellers , who divorced in 1996 and who both live in Tucker , recently used the collaborative approach to negotiate a new custody arrangement for their 13-year-old son . <p> They did n't want to return to the door-slamming and cold shoulders of their original divorce proceedings . The couple had made progress in their communication in recent years and wanted to continue on the same path . <p> Phil Sellers said they realized that he and his ex-wife needed more regular , and in-depth , discussions about Ian instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the other . <p> " He voices his problems ; I voice mine , " Bronwyn Sellers said . <p> The Sellers also had to compromise . He got the fifty-fifty custody split he wanted , but on a different schedule . She had to bend on the financial arrangement . <p> " It 's a negotiation process , " Phil Sellers said . <p> ' My daddy never showed up ' <p> While some divorcing parents struggle with overwhelming anger , their children often struggle with overwhelming grief . However , kids sometimes find they have no safe haven for discussing their feelings about the adults they love who are splitting up . <p> Instead , they act out . <p> A 6-year-old kicks a playmate , for example . " And we see her as naughty , " said Colleen Swift , director of Rainbows , a recovery program for children of divorce . But when the child is asked why she kicked her playmate , " she says , ' My daddy never showed up . ' " <p> In the past few years , many Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary seminars for children to help them avoid self-destructive behaviors from fighting to substance abuse . <p> Often these seminars run parallel with ones for parents . Children illustrate their feelings and heartache on reams of white paper and talk openly in the company of one or two adults ( no parents allowed ) . <p> Also , Rainbows , a nonprofit that offers free 14-week support groups for children suffering from divorce or other losses , is gaining momentum at area schools and churches . <p> Started in the early 1990s in Georgia , Rainbows initially served about 300 children a year . Last year , it served 3,000 kids across the state , allowing them to talk , cry and vent in the company of their peers . <p> Rainbows ' signature small-group settings are often filled with tears , and children sometimes get physically sick talking about divorce , Swift said . <p> At the 14-week end date , many children grow to accept the divorce as they participate in an activity-filled " Celebrate Me " day in which some kids paint rainbows on banners and others write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations , a Rainbows coordinator recommends further counseling . <p> This international organization is also in the midst of establishing sessions for preschoolers at area day care centers . <p> " We have children being reprimanded for acting out their feelings , " said Swift . " We give them a place where children can voice that hurt and realize they are not alone . " <p> ' They make it work for us ' <p> Hunter McCann , 11 , eagerly shows a visitor a poster he made last year . The words " My Heroes " are in red marker . Then there are three smiling orange figures : his mom , dad and stepfather . <p> When asked about whether the 1997 divorce has been painful , Hunter says , " No , not really . " <p> " It makes me feel really good that my parents get along , " he said . " It makes me feel really loved that they make it work for us . " <p> As his parents listen , they get teary-eyed . <p> Heather Rees and Jeff McCann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship overnight . <p> They point to hard work , swallowing their pride and creating a support network to help them maintain an amicable relationship . <p> Rees and McCann went to counseling for about a month during the divorce proceedings to learn new skills , such as drafting a detailed calendar a month in advance . <p> They have been tested . <p> After the divorce , Rees wanted to continue taking the children on a traditional family beach vacation in Florida . The only hitch was it always fell on Father 's Day  --  a day McCann would naturally want to spend with his kids . <p> But rather than fighting it , McCann drives to Florida the second half of the week and joins the family . <p> Another time , Veronica was begging to go home with him after a birthday party , but she was scheduled to spend that night with her mother . <p> " I wanted to cry , but I just keep reminding myself that I need to do what 's best for the children , " McCann said . " Us arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " <p> Now the family works smoothly enough that McCann and Phil Rees , a lawyer and owner of a health care company , can co-coach their daughters ' basketball team . Not only does Veronica play on Magic , but Phil 's 8-year-old daughter from a previous marriage , Samantha , plays too . <p> After an initial chilly and awkward period , Phil Rees remembers McCann taking him aside and saying , " I was n't married to you . I was married to Heather  --  and issues I have had are with her and not you . " <p> The family is now at a point where they can even joke about where a child is going to spend the night  --  once the source of hostile exchanges . <p> On a recent evening , McCann stopped by to see his children at Rees ' brick ranch home . Veronica , already in her pink pajamas , put her head inside her father 's jacket . <p> " La de dah , better go , " said McCann , lumbering toward the front door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay , you better lay off the chocolates , you are looking like a baboon , " Rees said . <p> Veronica bursts out laughing , jumps out of her dad 's jacket , runs over to her mom and gives her a kiss on the cheek . <p> " Just kidding , " says a smiling Veronica . " I know I am here tonight . " <p> News researcher Nisa Asokan contributed to this article . Parents often have no clue how much a vicious relationship with their ex-spouse can damage their children . " A mother or father would throw themselves in front of a charging wild animal to save their children , " said Margot Swann of Visions Anew , a divorce support group , " but many do n't realize their negative emotions are causing irreparable harm . " If they realized it , they would n't do it , but they get enveloped in their anger , pain and fear and they are not seeing it , " she said . For those parents struggling with hostility , there 's always hope the pattern can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension : <p> * Draft a calendar at least a month in advance ; discuss important holidays at least a year in advance . <p> * If phone or face-to-face conversations are tense , try e-mailing or faxing messages . <p> * Do not ask children to carry messages back and forth . <p> * Do not degrade the other parent in front of the child . <p> * Pay attention to tone when talking to your ex . <p> * Make sure the children know ( again and again ) the divorce is not their fault . <p> * Consider therapy during the divorce proceedings to help make the transition to co-parenting . <p> * Consider therapy for the children . <p> * Do not lean on your children for emotional support . <p> * Get involved in divorce support groups .  --  Helena Oliviero ; Graphic : MORE INFO <p> * For more information about collaborative law and a list of attorneys in Georgia who practice the collaborative approach : **26;6740;TOOLONG . <p> * For general information about the Rainbows organization : www.rainbows.org .
