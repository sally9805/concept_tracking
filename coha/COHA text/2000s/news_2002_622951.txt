<p> I never received more hate mail than I did a few months ago after writing this sentence in a story about getting sick when you 're a single person : " Of course , all men are babies when they get sick . " <p> It was a throwaway line , meant to be a humorous jab along the lines of what women have been saying since the Stone Age , when Conan had to stop hunting woolly mammoths because he got the sniffles and took to his fainting rock . <p> But oh , the backlash ! I was called every name in the book from femi-Nazi ( how can we ever thank Rush Limbaugh enough for that title ? ) to ho ' . You men , it seems , have had enough of the jokes , enough of being society 's new punching bag . You are mad as hell , and you 're not going to take it anymore . <p> One letter particularly stuck with me . " It 's a mystery to me why misogyny is so roundly booed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Misandry ? I had to look it up . It took me three dictionaries before I found the obscure word online . Noun : from the Greek " misandros " for " hating men . " <p> " I do n't hate men , " I pouted . " Some of my best friends are men . " <p> Then again , I had to allow , many of my male friends , while espousing their admiration for the female of the species , also made jokes that would cause one to wonder whether they secretly despised them . <p> Were they misogynists because they joked that their girlfriends were shopaholics and incessant feeling dissectors ? Was I a misandrist when I talked trash about my boyfriends ' being allergic to sticking glasses in the dishwasher ? <p> I thought not , but the question lingered . And in the months since , I have noticed many examples of what 's getting male America 's boxers in a twist . <p> Jay Leno quipped recently : " How can you tell when pigs are drunk ? They start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulating the Internet like wildfire ( see sidebar ) . And when I was paying for gas the other day , I noticed a lighter on the counter with a cartoon of a zoned-out guy with a beer gut watching TV . <p> On the lighter were the words : " Men are all alike - they just have different faces so we can tell them apart ! " <p> OK , if these jokes were about women - as , let 's face it , they were for generations - would they not be considered unconscionable ? Yes , they would . I had to admit I felt a certain pang at having jumped onto the dog pile . <p> Mind you , I hardly feel ready to lead a march on Washington to ease the burden of the poor unfortunate class that holds every power card in the world , but it seems increasingly clear that men have become society 's whipping-persons du jour - even scapegoats du jour for many societal ills . <p> And such things would clearly get my goat if I were a man - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitivities ! ( Sorry , could n't resist . ) <p> Women should pause for a moment and be glad the whipping-person title is at least shared , for a change , if not doffed entirely . The feminist movement helped reduce dramatically the number of negative portrayals of women in popular culture . Parents no longer need worry as much that their little girls are being assaulted with sexist images . <p> But what about their little boys ? I constantly wonder what my nephews think when they watch beer commercials in which the men act like Cro-Magnons during mating season . " Look , Auntie Jane ! I want to be just like that when I grow up , and get drunk and crush cans on my forehead . " <p> According to a controversial book released last year by Canadian academics Paul Nathanson and Katherine Young , little boys have far more to fear these days than little girls . <p> In " Spreading Misandry : The Teaching of Contempt for Men in Popular Culture , " they argue that feminism has gone too far and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also suggest that misandry is far more rampant today than misogyny - and far harder to spot . <p> Nathanson and Young point to TV , movies , books , print ads , even greeting cards , in suggesting that it 's de rigueur these days to laugh at , denigrate and demonize men - treatment that would never be acceptable if directed at women . <p> They warn that if allowed to go unchecked , male-bashing could have " disastrous consequences " for society . <p> On TV , there was Tim Allen , the dunderhead of " Home Improvement , " always relying on his brainy , long-suffering wife . Bart and Homer Simpson also qualify as misandric portrayals - both buffoons , according to Nathanson and Young , compared with the females on the show . Other misandric portrayals of men can also be found on " The Golden Girls , " " Beavis and Butthead , " even " Sex and the City . " <p> Now we 're walking on holy ground . But wait a minute . If " Sex and the City " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of someone 's partner , as the women did on the episode about Kyle MacLachlan 's character , there would be a huge outcry . <p> And looking for misandry in the movies these days is too easy . But , the authors note , it 's sometimes hard to distinguish misogyny from misandry . <p> " Our definition of misandry is simple , " Nathanson told the Edmonton Journal . " Every major male character is either evil or inadequate , and every major female character is either virtuous or victimized or both . " <p> Take Mel Gibson 's character in " What Women Want . " He is shown to be an amoral , brutish , sexist lout . He 's not a misogynist , the authors say ; the portrayal is misandrist because whoever wrote his character clearly hates men . Gibson 's Nick is a pig who is rehabilitated by the good women of society . <p> They also point to Gaston in " Beauty and the Beast , " the evil yuppies of " In the Company of Men , " the man-cooking female protagonists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as evil batterers , like " Sleeping With the Enemy , " J.Lo 's " Enough , " " The Color Purple " and " Thelma &; Louise . " <p> It 's also easy to point to some recently released books - ostensibly books of humor - with titles like " Women Are From Venus , Men Are From Hell , " " All Men Are Jerks Until Proven Otherwise " and " Men and Other Reptiles . " <p> The authors argue that misandry has become a critical social concern because any time it becomes politically correct to bash a given group , society as a whole suffers . <p> But I have one very large question about all this : If it 's true that the tide of hatred is slowly rising against men , how has it been allowed to happen , given that men still control every elite group ? The government we obey , the businesses we patronize , the entertainment we watch ? <p> That would be a book I 'd be curious to read . <p> And I think men should speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthinking nastiness . At the same time , it 's wrong to blame misandry on feminism . <p> Feminism was a reaction to misogyny , not the birth of misandry . Only a radical few thought that earning equal wages ( which we still - do n't get ) equaled hating men . And feminism has still not eradicated femme-bashing ; you only have to listen to certain rap lyrics to know that . <p> Perhaps masculinism , should that become a true movement , will help us find a middle ground devoid of jerking knees , rage and blame . <p> Hit the road , Jack <p> Through the ages , famous women ( and some men ) have celebrated misandry with pithy aphorisms and pointed song lyrics . <p> I hate men <p> I ca n't abide ' em even now and then . <p> Than ever marry one of them , I 'd rest a virgin rather . <p> For husbands are a boring lot and only give you bother . <p> Of course , I 'm awf'lly glad that Mother had to marry Father . . . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types I 've ever met within our democracy , <p> I hate the most , the athlete with his manner bold and brassy . <p> He may have hair upon his chest , but sister , so has Lassie ! <p> Oh , I hate men ! <p> - Cole Porter , " Kiss Me Kate " <p> Women want mediocre men , and men are working hard to become as mediocre as possible . <p> - Margaret Mead <p> I married beneath me .

The Navajo woman thanked Susie and accepted the offer . <p> After a bit of small talk while resuming the journey , the Navajo woman noticed a brown bag on the seat next to Susie . <p> " What 's in the bag ? " asked the woman . Susie looked down at the brown bag and said , " It 's a bottle of wine . I got it for my husband . " <p> The Navajo woman was silent for a moment , but then , speaking with the quiet wisdom of an elder , said , " Good trade . " <p>  --  In the hospital , some relatives gathered in the waiting room , near where a family member lay gravely ill . Finally , the doctor came in looking tired and somber . <p> " I 'm afraid I 'm the bearer of bad news , " he said as he surveyed the worried faces . " The only hope left for your loved one at this time is a brain transplant . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only hope . You will have to pay for the brain yourselves . " <p> The family members sat silently as they absorbed the news . After a great length of time , someone asked , " Well , how much does a brain cost ? " The doctor quickly responded , " $5,000 for a male brain , and $200 for a female brain . " <p> The moment turned awkward . Men in the room tried not to smile , avoiding eye contact with the women , but some actually smirked . A man , unable to control his curiosity , blurted out the question everyone wanted to ask : " Why is the male brain so much more ? " <p> The doctor smiled at his childish innocence and explained to the entire group , " It 's just standard pricing procedure . We have to mark down the price of the female brains , because they 've actually been used . " <p>  --  Classes for Men at our local learning annex .
