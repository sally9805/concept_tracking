I // A New Literature Springs Up in the New World // From the very beginning , women were creating the new words of the New World . The first women writers in America , Anne Bradstreet ( 1612-1672 ) and Mary Rowlandson ( 1637-1711 ) , were born in England and endured the harrowing three-month voyage of storm , seasickness , and starvation across the North Atlantic . In Massachusetts , where they settled , they led lives of extraordinary danger and deprivation . Both married and had children ; they thought of themselves primarily as good wives and mothers . Both made the glory of God their justification for writing , but they prefigured themes and concerns that would preoccupy American women writers for the next 150 years and more  --  Bradstreet , the poet , writing about the intimacies and agonies of domestic life , including pregnancy and maternity , the death of three of her grandchildren , and the destruction of her home by fire ; and Rowlandson , writing a narrative of her captivity by Narragansett Indians , and pioneering the great American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . // Both Bradstreet and Rowlandson entered print shielded by the authorization , legitimization , and testimony of men . In Bradstreet ? s case , no fewer than eleven men wrote testimonials and poems praising her piety and industry , prefatory materials almost as long as the thirteen poems in the book . In his introductory letter , John Woodbridge , her brother-in-law , stood guarantee that Bradstreet herself had written the poems , that she had not initiated their publication , and that she had neglected no housekeeping chore in their making : " these Poems are the fruit but of some few houres , curtailed from her sleep and other refreshments . " Rowlandson ? s narrative too came with " a preface to the reader " signed " Per Amicum " ( " By a Friend " ) , probably the minister Increase Mather , which explained that although the work had been " penned by this Gentlewoman , " she had written it as a " Memorandum of Gods dealing with her , " and it was a " pious scope , which deserves both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication of her narrative out of vanity ; rather , // some Friends having obtained a sight of it , could not but be so much affected with the many passages of working providence discovered therein , as to judge it worthy of publick view , and altogether unmeet that such works of God should be hid from present and future Generation : and therefore though this Gentlewoman ? s modesty would not thrust it into the Press , yet her gratitude to God , made her not hardly perswadable to let it pass , that God might have his due glory , and others benefit by it as well as her selfe. // Having given a lengthy defense of the virtues of the book , the Friend concluded with the hope that " none will cast any reflection upon this Gentlewoman , on the score of this publication , " and warned that any who did " may be reckoned with the nine Lepers , " symbols of ingratitude . Apparently no one dared come forward to complain about Rowlandson after this endorsement . // We know that New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to women , and that God had designed it so . They were notoriously unsympathetic to women who defied God ? s plan for the sexes by conspicuous learning or reading , and they could be hostile to women who went outside their sphere by preaching or writing . The most official expression of this hostility was the trial of Anne Hutchinson in 1637 . Hutchinson belonged to a dissident sect , but she had also been leading her own discussion groups for women . Tried for " traducing the ministers " and for blasphemy while she was pregnant with her fifteenth child , Hutchinson was excommunicated and forced to leave the Massachusetts Bay Colony , with her husband and children . The entire Hutchinson family , with the exception of one daughter , were killed by Indians in 1643 . In 1645 , when Ann Yale Hopkins , the wife of Governor Edward Hopkins of Hartford , became insane , John Winthrop blamed her " giving herself wholly to reading and writing , " rather than the hardships of colonial life , for her breakdown . " If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as belong to women , and not gone out of her way and calling to meddle such things as are proper for men , whose minds are stronger . . . she had kept her wits . " // Despite these instances , the shared hardships of life in the New World gave women an existential equality with men that allowed Bradstreet and Rowlandson self-expression . Both men and women shared cold and hunger , faced disease and death , and risked captivity and massacre . Almost two hundred members of the Massachusetts Bay Colony died during the first year . Women had to do the hard physical labor of cooking , baking , cleaning , dairying , spinning , weaving , sewing , washing , and ironing . They endured the dangers of childbirth in the wilderness , nursed babies , and often buried them . While in strict religious terms " goodwives " were not supposed to trespass on the masculine sphere of literary expression , in reality there was more flexibility and tolerance . As two of her modern editors observe , " Bradstreet was not censured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thought , or personal assertiveness , so far as we know . Rather , she was praised and encouraged ; and there are no indications that the males in her life treated her as ? property. ? If anything , she was treated as at least an intellectual equal . " 1 // A Poet Crowned with Parsley  --  Anne Bradstreet // Anne Bradstreet ? s The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America ( 1650 ) was the first book by a woman living in America , although it was actually published in London and entered in the Stationers ? Register . Bradstreet wrote with both an awareness of her gender , and a sense of rootedness in New England Puritan culture . Adrienne Rich has paid tribute to her achievement and summed up her inspiring example for future American women poets : // Anne Bradstreet happened to be one of the first American women inhabiting a time and place in which heroism was a necessity of life , and men and women were fighting for survival both as individuals and as a community . To find room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of great self-assertion and vitality . To have written poems . . . while rearing eight children , lying frequently sick , keeping house at the edge of the wilderness , was to have managed a poet ? s range and extension within confines as severe as any American poet has confronted.2 // But Bradstreet was much more than a heroic female survivor who courageously managed to compose poetry in her spare time . She was also a strong , original poet whose work can be read today with enjoyment and emotion , a woman who wrote great poems expressing timeless themes of love , loss , doubt , and faith . Despite her strict Puritan beliefs , she had wit and a sense of humor . And while she dutifully imitated the prevailing models of male poetic excellence , from Sir Philip Sidney to the French Protestant poet Guillaume Du Bartas ( whose huge unfinished epic of the Creation was among the Puritans ? most revered texts ) , she also explored some of the most central issues for the development of American women ? s writing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to use strong and memorable language without ceasing to be womanly . // We don ? t know all the facts of Anne Bradstreet ? s life , but what we do know suggests that growing up in England she began to think of herself as a poet from an early age . While her brother went to Cambridge , she was tutored in Greek , Latin , French , and Hebrew by her father , Thomas Dudley , the steward to the Earl of Lincoln , and had access to the earl ? s large library . She had begun to compose her own poems by the time she was sixteen , when she married twenty-five-year-old Simon Bradstreet , a graduate of Emmanuel College , Cambridge , who had assisted her father in his stewardship . The marriage was a love match , and indeed Bradstreet would dedicate to Simon one of the most beautiful poems a woman ever wrote about her husband . // In early April of 1630 , the Bradstreets and the Dudleys were among the Puritan members of the New England Company who embarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flagship of a little fleet of four vessels . Another passenger , John Winthrop , who would become the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , preached a famous sermon to the pilgrims aboard , declaring that God was supporting their expedition , and that their settlement would be like " a Citty upon a Hill , " with the " eyes of all people " upon them . But when they arrived in Salem on June 12 , 1630 , they discovered that disease and starvation had decimated the small Bay Colony , and many among their own numbers died in the first weeks . The Salem settlers had been living in caves , huts , and wigwams , and had not even been able to plant crops . For the next few years the pioneers battled to survive , eating clams , mussels , nuts , and acorns ; building shelters ; and facing cold , hunger , and illness as well as anxiety and homesickness. // Both Bradstreet ? s father and her husband served as governors of the struggling colony . For the difficult first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a child . In her journal she confessed : " It pleased God to keep me a long time without a child , which was a great grief to me , and cost me many prayers and tears before I obtaind one , and after him gave me many more . " She also became ill and was bedridden for several months in 1632 with fever and coughing . When she recovered , she wrote her first poem , " Upon a Fit of Sickness , " thanking God for his mercy in sparing her life . And the following year , she gave birth to her first son , Samuel . // Anne Hutchinson came to New England in 1634 , and Bradstreet witnessed the events of her rise and fall . But as Charlotte Gordon points out , " ironically , Mistress Hutchinson ? s downfall ushered in the most fertile decade of Anne Bradstreet ? s life  --  fertile in every sense of the word . " Already the mother of a son and a daughter , Bradstreet gave birth to five more children during these years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than six thousand lines of poetry , more than almost any other English writer on either side of the Atlantic composed in an entire lifetime . For most of this time , she was either pregnant , recovering from childbirth , or nursing an infant , establishing herself as a woman blessed by God , the highest commendation a New England Puritan mother could receive . " 3 // The poems Bradstreet was writing were intellectual and scholarly , formally influenced by English and European masters . But she was aroused and provoked by the great political events taking place in England in the 1640s , particularly the English Civil War , which led to the execution of Charles I. Five thousand of the six thousand lines of poetry she composed during the decade came from her long poem in heroic couplets , " The Four Monarchies , " in which she chronicled the pre-Christian empires of Assyria , Persia , Greece , and Rome , examining the legitimacy of kings and emperors . These were not the standard subjects of pious women ? s verse , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from criticism by insisting that she was a modest woman who had no intention of competing with male epic poets : // To sing of wars , of captains , and of kings , // Of cities founded , commonwealths begun , // For my mean pen are too superior things . . . // Let poets and historians set these forth , // My obscure lines shall not so dim their worth . // Like English women poets of her time , such as Anne Finch and Anne Killigrew , she emphasized her inferiority and temerity in writing at all , calling her Muse " foolish , broken , blemished . " While men rightly contended for fame and precedence , Bradstreet flatteringly claimed , she was content with her humble domestic niche , and her poems would make those of her male contemporaries look even more impressive : // If e ? er you deign these lowly lines your eyes , // Give thyme or Parsley wreath , I ask no Bayes. // This mean and unrefined ore of mine // Will make your glist ? ring gold but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay or laurel wreath , she asked only for a wreath of parsley and thyme , kitchen herbs rather than Parnassian prizes . Bradstreet was the Poet Parsleyate , the woman poet whose domestic work enabled the leisured creativity of men ; but her imagery of the humble kitchen of Parnassus would be echoed in many heartfelt cries by the American women writers who came after her . // The humility of these lines , however , was balanced by her request for men to give women poets the space and the chance they deserved : // Men have precedency and still excel , // It is but vain unjustly to wage war ; // Men can do best , and Women know it well . // Preeminence in all and each is yours ; // Yet grant some small acknowledgment of ours . // In 1649 , Bradstreet ? s brother-in-law , the Reverend John Woodbridge , who was in England acting as a clerical adviser to the Puritan army , arranged to have her poems published by a bookseller in Popes Head Alley , London , under the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Severall Poems , compiled with great variety of Wit and Learning , full of delight . As the cover went on to explain , the book included " a complete discourse and description of the Four Elements , Constitutions , Ages of Man , Seasons of the Year " and " an Exact Epitome of the Four Monarchies . . . Also a Dialogue between Old England and New , concerning the late troubles , with divers other pleasant and serious Poems . " In his prefatory verse , " To my Dear Sister , the Author of These Poems , " he congratulated her on her achievements : // What you have done , the Sun shall witnesse bear , // That for a womans Worke ? t is very rare ; // And if the Nine vouchsafe the Tenth a place , // I think they rightly may yield you that grace . // In England , The Tenth Muse was well received as evidence of the genius of the woman of the New World , and became one of the " most vendible , " or best-selling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list with Shakespeare and Milton . In New England , it was widely read and esteemed.4 //
