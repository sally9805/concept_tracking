The Boston Red Sox did a magnificent job of winning baseball 's World Series championship Nov. 8 . Even though I 'm a New York Yankees fan , I admit that sluggers David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez were superb in leading their team to victory . The Curse of the Bambino has finally been broken ! <P> AISHA JAMIL Centreville , Va . <P> There are n't many old-timers , by cracky , who saw the Red Sox lose their first World Series , way back in 1946 . I was 16 and hitchhiked from Iowa City , Iowa , to St. Louis , Mo. , for Game 1 . I slept in the railroad station and bought a $3 standing-room ticket for behind home plate . The Sox tied the game in the ninth , and Rudy York won it in the 10th with a blast to the last row of the bleachers  --  and I was the only one in the park yelling . I 'm happy for today 's Boston kids , but most of them have never known the character-building advantages of defeat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , with some left over to give to any New York fans out there . A Massachusetts girl said it best : " Success is counted sweetest/ By those who ne'er succeed . " Emily Dickinson would have been a Red Sox fan . <P> JOHN B. HOLWAY Springfield , Va . <P> I 'm glad the Red Sox won the World Series , if for no other reason than we no longer have to hear about the Curse of the Bambino . The reason the Red Sox had n't won a World Series since 1918 was simple : the team was never good enough to win . Now that the Red Sox have won , they can go back to playing their usual role as second best to the Yankees . But it will be without any excuses . <P> ROY WESTON Victoria , B.C. <P> My great-grandfather Harry Frazee , who owned the Red Sox from 1916 to ' 23 , did not sell Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees to finance a Broadway play , as the legendary Curse of the Bambino would have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses entirely separate . The so-called curse of the past 86 years has been nothing but a pathetic excuse for more than eight decades of mediocre baseball , which is thankfully now put to rest . <P> JIM FRAZEE Oslo <P> I read with amusement ( and a little disdain ) your cover article on the poor Red Sox fans , who for 86 years have been waiting patiently for a World Series championship . In 45 professional seasons ( 37 in football and eight in NBA basketball ) , New Orleans has n't even had one of its home teams appear in a title game or series . So while I can certainly relate to the Boston sports fans ' pain , let 's have a little sports sympathy for a town that has really earned it . <P> GUY DUPLANTIER New Orleans <P> Explosives at Large <P> Re the 377 tons of munitions missing from Iraq 's al-Qaqaa military complex since March 2003 Nov. 8 : If you were planning a war and you knew where the enemy 's munitions dumps were , would n't you send a missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fighting capabilities ? The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) alerted U.S. officials about the dangerous weapons at al-Qaqaa in January 2003 . The proper question is n't , When did the arms disappear ? The question is , Why were n't they marked for destruction before our troops started moving up the road toward them ? I always thought disrupting the enemy 's supply chain  --  especially its dangerous weaponry  --  was a basic strategy of offensive warfare . <P> TIM CONEY Medford , Ore .
