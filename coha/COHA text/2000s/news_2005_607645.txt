<p> This summer , the Mannings took their first family vacation in about a half-dozen years . Like a lot of families , Eli Manning , his girlfriend , his parents and his brothers and their families headed for a Florida beach . But Eli and his older brother , Peyton , had a little different concept of relaxation than most vacationers . <p> The family 's two active NFL quarterbacks worked out together , alternating between their slightly different programs for running and weightlifting . They did n't try to out-lift each other , Eli said , but they did attempt to out-sprint one another on the final 100 yards of a run . <p> " The last 100 were , ' Let 's go , ' " the second-year quarterback said as he sat outside the dining hall at the New York Giants ' training camp , then added with a grin : " I wo n't tell you who won , just because I do n't want to embarrass him . " <p> There are n't that many chances for Eli Manning to compete directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took down the hoop at his home , Eli said , and does n't want the brothers to play basketball against each other any more , fearing an injury . Eli does n't even try to beat Peyton on the golf course because Peyton is so much better . <p> But Eli Manning must compete every day with the standards set by his brother . While Eli , the top overall choice in last year 's NFL draft who was obtained by the Giants in a draft-day trade , took his lumps as a rookie last season , Peyton was busy breaking Dan Marino 's single-season league record for touchdown passes and leading the Indianapolis Colts to the playoffs . <p> Now , as he prepares for his second year in the league as the Giants ' undisputed starter , Eli knows that his brother went from throwing 28 interceptions ( to go with 26 touchdown passes ) in 1998 as a rookie for a Colts team that went 3-13 to throwing 26 touchdown passes and only 15 interceptions to help Indianapolis to a 13-3 mark in ' 99 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that jump , also , " Eli Manning said . " People have said that , and my response to that is , ' You see a lot of people make the jump from the first to second year . They get much better and their seasons go a little better . But it 's not guaranteed for me . ' I 've still got to put my work in . I 've still got to have a good camp and good practices and try to have a good season . It 's not like it 's automatically going to happen . " <p> The Giants have much riding on his success . They said goodbye in the offseason to Kurt Warner , the two-time league most valuable player who was signed to be Manning 's mentor and was the starter early last season . The team was 5-4 when Coach Tom Coughlin made the switch from Warner to Manning and did n't win again until a season-ending triumph over the Dallas Cowboys , finishing 6-10 . <p> Still , Manning appears to have emerged without lasting scars and his teammates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Hara played in Cleveland with quarterback Tim Couch , the top overall pick in the 1999 draft whose NFL career has been a flop , and said Manning is handling the pressure better than Couch did . <p> " He 's been scrutinized since he was in high school : ' Are you as good as your brother ? Are you as good as your father ? ' " O'Hara said . " For him to even get as far as he is right now , that shows what his internal drive is . . . . He watched his brother fall all over himself as an NFL rookie . And to see that and then to be able to see it 's okay to do that  --  it 's okay to fall down , it 's okay to fail  --  he 's not scared to make a mistake . . . . When you 're worried about making mistakes , you stop learning . " <p> Manning said he studied his throwing technique and is trying to get back to the way he threw the ball in college at Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low point of last season came when he had a passer rating of zero in a December game at Baltimore , looking completely overmatched and confused against the Ravens ' defense . On the train ride home after that game , Manning sat with Giants quarterbacks coach Kevin Gilbride , and the two decided to come up with what Manning calls a " base offense , " a small group of plays that Manning could practice over and over to get comfortable with , then turn to in games when he needed a completion . Manning pitched the idea to Coughlin , and Coughlin agreed . <p> Things got better from there , and Manning ended on an upswing . The Giants got the winning touchdown in the final seconds of the Dallas game when Manning , after convincing the coaches on the sideline during a timeout that he could be trusted to make the right audible call , switched from a passing to a running play and handed the ball to tailback Tiki Barber . <p> " The coaches were kind of undecided whether to put that on my shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning said . " I said , ' I can handle it . ' They kind of looked at me and I said , ' I know what I 'm doing . ' " <p> Said O'Hara : " There has to come a moment in your career where you say to yourself , ' You know what ? I belong here . I can do this , and everybody else feels the same way . ' I think that Dallas game was maybe that kind of little pat on the butt that he needed . . . . As much as Eli comes off as being quiet , kind of shy , a little choirboy , he 's actually a really good guy . He 's a lot of fun to kind of make fun of . He dishes it out pretty good , too . He 's got a great sense of humor . As goofy as he looks sometimes , he 's actually really smart . " <p> Manning chuckles when he says that he lives in Hoboken , N.J. , because it has the same small-town feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't trying to escape the fact that he plays on the big New York stage  --  just as he never was bothered by being the youngest member of quarterbacking 's first family . <p> " I 'm hard on myself , I think , but I did n't get down , " Manning said of last season 's trials . " I did n't get depressed , by any means . . . . I do n't think I found myself intimidated by New York . . . . I never dreaded talking to the media or dreaded anything about the city . " <p> There is plenty of optimism in the Giants ' camp , in part because Manning should be much more comfortable and in part because players seem more accepting of Coughlin 's taskmaster ways . Last season 's getting-to-know-you period was difficult for Coughlin and Giants veterans , who bristled when the new coach did things such as fining players for being merely on time to team meetings instead of the five minutes early that Coughlin demands . <p> " I think everybody knows what to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 of 8 passes for 53 yards in the Giants ' 17-14 preseason loss Saturday to Cleveland . He threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress . " The five minutes early , that 's just part of it . Now you know how it is . No one talks about it anymore . . . . That 's just the way it is . There are no ifs , ands or buts about it . " <p> Coughlin said it 's not only the players who are adapting . <p> " Sure , I 've changed with them , " Coughlin said . " I know them very well , and they know me . It 's just a product of the opportunity we 've had to work together . It gets better . " <p> In the end , though , the Giants likely will rise or fall based on how quickly their 24-year-old quarterback develops . " I expect myself to play better than I did last year , " Manning said . " I have high expectations of my ability that I can play this game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , is he going to find a way to compete with his brother ? <p> " I 've got to work on my golf game , I guess , to get competitive , " he said , " and my football game , to get where he is.
