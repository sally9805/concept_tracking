1 For Isaiah Neuhaus If one day can mark a person forever , what of two days ? Those two days , when I knew your father , when he was young , have marked me since . I can tell you what I know of his story only by telling you the marked part of mine . Your father . His mother . My son . Each life altered , or ended , by events that for you can be a source of indelible pride , your patrimony , a legacy from which to take the measure of all that honors the memory of your father . But these are events that had a different meaning for me , the measure of which , I tell you at the start , is the sadness you may already sense in the space between these words . I have never told this story to anyone . Because your father asked me to , I am telling it to you . People of my generation , ahead of his , saw so little as it actually was then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West , bad and good , gave shape also to our most intimate relationships . An iron curtain ran not just , as Churchill put it , from the Balkans to Trieste , but between those of us who claimed to be grown and in charge and those , like your father and my son , who seemed still so unfinished and , as I thought of them , vulnerable . When Michael was away from me , I often feared that he would get lost , which was my way of fearing , I suppose , that I would lose him . It was a fear I could not acknowledge as being more for myself than for him , because I had yet to reckon with what I had already lost . What characterized our personal East-West division broadly dubbed in America a few years later as the generation gap was that Michael wasthe wounded one . That was presumptively a function of his longtime status as a handicapped child , but then it also became a matter of my efficient pretense that the loss we 'd undergone together the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I did was for him , never for myself . Thus , if the world we 'd inherited was to be a jungle , I would be Michael 's brush cutter , leading the way through impassable thickets with my machete , hacking out a path for him , calling over my shoulder , ' This way , son . This way . ' Not noticing until too late that he had stopped following . That he had disappeared . This story , which I 've told myself a thousand times , always begins with the sixth stroke of the clock , the grandfather clock with the elaborately carved oaken case that I hear ticking now , not far from where I sit writing in my old house in New York City . In our German days , the clock was in the sitting room of the big house the bank had leased not for me , since five nights out of seven I was there alone , but for the holders of my position . I 'd found the clock in a warehouse near the Rhine : all Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fine things of a lost world for sale cheap . I bought the clock , I think , to stake a claim to the timbered mansion assigned to me , and the sonorous Westminster gong wafted through those lonely rooms like the regular greeting of a friendly ghost . If any house had the right to be haunted , it was that one . It was built after the First World War in Dahlberg , a near suburb on the opposite side of Frankfurt from the factory and rail yard district , which was why it not been bombed in the Second . After those two wars , Germany was a nation of ghosts , an infelicitous place for a man and a boy yoked together by blood and affection , of course , but also by that knot of loss . We never asked it of each other , but our question was , If she can vanish from our lives , why then ca n't you from mine ? Five , beat , six . I remember looking up from that day 's Frankfurter Neue Presse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of improving my German . ' Improving ' overstates it perhaps . In my months in the country , I had come up against a linguistic mental block , and German had so far remained impenetrable to me , a blow more to my pride than my professional performance , since everyone in banking spoke English . All that week , however , I had been especially motivated to decipher the local news . As I lumpishly tracked through the text of a particular story , the clock had struck six . Without being aware of it , I had kept the count , and it was exactly then that the question first rang in my head : Where is Michael ? It was late in April 1961 , a Friday evening . I looked up from the paper fully expecting to see Michael 's shyly grinning face in the archway that marked the entrance foyer off from the sitting room . I saw the tall green ceramic-tiled brazier on the near side of the arch , and through the arch , the mahogany bench onto which Michael would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mind ready to worry , his absence supplied a vivid sensation : an image in the vacant air of his lanky , thin frame at a slouching angle , the loose posture of a young man with leg braces . ' Hey , Dad . ' Is he grinning ? Has he left behind his anger at me ? Our first awful fight . ' Hay is for horses , ' I would have said , a daring echo of what had been his mother 's good-humored correction . Humor as a ladder out of the pit of hurt . But where is he ? April 1961 . The newspapers had been full of what came to be called the Bay of Pigs fiasco , the first shocking failure of the young Kennedy administration . There is no way to convey now the palpable sense of danger with which we all lived in those years . Kennedy and Khrushchev were like the cowboy gunfighters then dominating movies and television , men forever on the verge of drawing weapons , but weapons that would kill us all . Political fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , could seem nuclear , too . Worry that something had happened to my son , or , if I was lucky , that he was only angry at me , was as deeply unsettling as my fear of what I read in our awful newspapers . But the news story I had been trying to follow that week was about an event that had taken place right in front of me , as if to warn that even a life like mine could be dangerous . On the previous Monday , I had attended a conference of Germany 's major steel producers at Rhine-Main Hall , a new convention center in the reborn heart of Frankfurt . The meeting had been called by the Bonn Ministry for Economic Cooperation . Gathered in a function room were about two hundred dark-suited men , mostly German but also including European Coal and Steel Community delegates and a smattering of financiers from various countries , of whom I was one . At meetings l language spoken was always English , which was a main reason my German never improved . The purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECSC consortium to develop iron imports from Africa . The third of a number of speakers in the afternoon session approached the podium , a distinguished-looking man who thin , tall , well tailored , and bald reminded me of Britain 's Prince Philip . I had actually been thinking of slipping out , but the agenda notes identified him as having lived in Moravia for a decade as the representative of Rheinstahl , one of the great German steel companies . He had no doubt been acquiring options on Liberia 's inland iron mines , and his on-the-ground experience in Africa set him apart from the other speakers , and I decided to hear what he had to say . At the podium , he opened the folder that held his notes , took a sip of water , and was about to speak when a man appeared from behind a curtain at the edge of the stage . He crossed quickly to the speaker , approaching from the rear , and before the speaker noticed him , the man extended his arm , seeming to touch the speaker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first such sound I had heard since the war . It was a tinny noise I did not recognize , since my experience of gunfire had always been outdoors . Then the man fell forward , and an image of the crimson spray had remained with me all week . Michael , where are you ? I am sure it was a Friday , and I am sure of the time , because on Fridays Michael always caught the 4:07 from Wiesbaden to Frankfurt , then the 5:20 from the Hauptbahnhof to the Dahlberg station , and then i was a ten-minute walk to our house , even for Michael , whose gait was awkward but steady . This distance he insisted on covering by foot , a point of valiant stubbornness to which I relented because I knew how he hated being taken for disabled when , as he put it once , he was only slow . I knew also that his doctors in New York had encouraged him to walk as much as he could . On that one day of the week , I made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be there when he came through the door with his sack und pack and stick at 5:50 . But quickly I remembered that this Friday was to be different . Michael was to be home at the usual hour , but he was coming back to Frankfurt not by train but by car , my car , which he was driving . That realization made me sit up , the trite reaction of every parent who 'd ever overcome a qualm to let a teenager take the car . At the end of the previous weekend , he had made a rare request , asking if he could drive back to school instead of taking the train . He knew I did n't need the car during the week , since my job brought with it a car and driver . And he knew , I think , how pleased I was that he had taken so naturally to driving , despite his handicap . It was the beauty of the then new automatic gearshift in truth , he 'd have had trouble with a clutch and I 'd bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its eventual driver . The pleasure I 'd seen him taking at the wheel since obtaining his license was my pleasure , too . All of this went into his clear assumption that I would say yes . ' But boarders are forbidden to have cars , ' I said . ' Just to and from Wiesbaden , ' he offered . ' I 'll leave it parked for the week . The dorm director will never know . ' I saw how he had allowed himself to count on it , which , perversely , may be what prompted my initial no , as if the boy needed a lesson against presumption . Michael was seventeen years old , a senior at the American high school in the charming spa city near the Rhine , fifty miles away . Eisenhower had made Wiesbaden his headquarters after crossing the Rhine , and by our time it served as headquarters for the U.S. Air Force in Europe ' U-Safe , ' in the argot . The sons and daughters of NCOs and officers who lived in Wiesbaden 's several American enclaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-story dormitory also accommodated the teenage children of U.S. servicemen stationed across Europe . And some additional students , like Michael , were children of American civilians with Defense Department connections NATO-attached tech reps for Lockheed or Martin-Marietta , say , or cigarette wholesalers charged with supplying the vast PX system of the occupation army . My own DoD connection was thin , and ran through New York , not Washington . I was chief of the Frankfurt office of the Chase International Investment Corporation , a spinoff of Chase Manhattan Bank , which had begun a decade before as a main funnel for Marshall Plan funds when American investment shifted from governments to businesses . The war had left the Continent starved for consumer goods , and German manufacturers , with the advantage of needing to retool from scratch , had pounced on the market . Those of us at Chase investing n the state bureaucracies but in individual entrepreneurs and private companies embodied the beau ideal of American democracy , what would later come to be called free-market capitalism . So we were front-liners in the Cold War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our investments were running at thirty or forty percent , which set off a second-stage boom in finance as the industrial recovery of the Bundes republik began to fuel itself . We called it the bottom-line blitzkrieg . People like me , in our recognizably American Brooks Brothers tailor-mades , prided ourselves on having nothing to do with the omnipresent but culturally isolated U.S. military , who , out of uniform , favored Ban-Lons and double-knits . We did not shop in their commissaries , and we did not work out in their gyms . Our chauffeurs drove us in Taunus sedans or Mercedeses , decidedly not Oldsmobiles . And we spoke German or , as in my case , felt guilty if we did not . If we had school-age children , they boarded at English public schools , Swiss convent schools , or back home at New England prep schools . Rarely would the child of someone in my position have been a candidate for General H. H. Arnold High School at Wiesbaden Air Base , a putative reproduction of a small-town American secondary school . But it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , I wanted him close . When he was little , Michael was a boy who loved movement above all if possible , on wheels , so his love of driving was no surprise . The first real change in his life came with his tricycle , a Christmas present when he was four or five . It w a machine on which he could demonstrate his true character his daring , his restlessness , his bright assumption that the earth was flat so that he could go fast . When I would come home in the evening , nothing would do but that I take him down to the basement of the apartment building where storage cages lined a labyrinthine passageway that Michael regarded as his personal racecourse . I recall chicken wire stretched onto lumber frames , naked light bulbs on the ceiling every twenty feet or so , a succession of right-angle turns . His circuit was quick and , with all that cushiony chicken wire , I thought , safe . But near the doorway to the stairwell , one sharp cinderblock corner jutted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always cut by it easily . Once , however , I made a pretense of giving chase , which made Michael laugh and pour it on . As he barreled through the maze now , pulling away , he tossed triumphant looks back over his shoulder at me . He disappeared around a last turn , I heard his crash , and knew at once he 'd hit the cinderblock angle . He took the sharp edge on his face , breaking his nose and opening a gash in his forehead from which blood was gushing , as from a pump , by the time I got to him . The sight of his wrecked face filled me with panic and guilt , but he remained calm . Stunned into calm , I thought , but that was n't so . Michael was in pain , awash in blood crimson spray but he was n't afraid because he was certain that nothing bad would happen to him if I was there . But I was n't there some years later , the day he came home early from school he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a student at the Cathedral School of St. John the Divine , in Morningside Heights . Edie was a volunteer docent a sort of guide at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and she was there when the school nurse called to say she was sending Michael home in a taxi because he had a fever . I was in Washington , preparing to leave for Paris as part of a government delegation . Edie called me that night and described fever , headache , loss of appetite , vomiting . I would have come home , but she said the doctor had labeled it flu and was confident the symptoms would abate in a day or two , and they did . Soon Michael was back to normal and returned to school , and I boarded a plane to Paris . Two days later , Michael 's symptoms came raging back , accompanied by the general muscular weakness known as paralysis . I was in a meeting with finance ministers , in a room with extremely high ceilings and Palladian windows overlooking the Tuileries , when an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come home now . M. has poliomyelitis . E. ' I remember being struck by the fact that Edie , not spelling out Michael 's name or her own , had spelled out the full Latin name of the disease , preferring it no doubt to the blatantly descriptive ' infantile paralysis . ' I remember also feeling a blast of anger at the injustice of it , since that was the spring of Jonas Salk , and the broad assumption was that the scourge of polio had been defeated . Indeed , Michael would be one of the last American children to succumb . When I saw him next , it was in a large room at St. Luke 's Hospital , also in Heights . The room contained about a dozen iron lungs , the airtight metal cylinders that encased patients up to their necks , helping the more severely affected children to breathe . By the time I walked into that room , I had done my homework and knew that the virus attacks the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord , an interruption of communication from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to the level of diagnosis even , and the virus was shaken off without lasting damage , without ever being identified . Most of those whose symptoms were recognized did not become paralyzed . Most suffered muscle impairment from which the body recovered . Few polio victims were left crippled , and my desperate hope , as I followed the nurse to my son sealed in iron , was that he not be one of those . Let the other children in this room fill out the odds , I prayed with exquisite selfishness . I loved my son with a ferocity that would have exchanged the world for him , to the point of killing it . My son was all there was . It was nearly midnight , and the room was dark . I had just come from the airport . The hum of mechanized respiration , a dozen unsynchronized motors , filled the room , but the sound registered as a kind of quiet . The children lay sleeping in their cylinders with their heads protruding like knobs , like magicians ' assistants waiting to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we came to him , and the sight of his eyes benignly closed filled me with grief . I only then realized what I had been most dreading , the statement in his blank look as it met mine : ' If you had been here , Dad , this would not hav happened . ' ' I 'm here now , ' I meant my eyes to say , but Michael , asleep , had no need to rebuke me . Awake , later , he never did . I bent to kiss his forehead and saw the salty residue of a tear track running from his eye down across his temple to his ear . Dried tracks like that marked each side of his face . A stoic child who goes to sleep weeping , unable to wipe the tears from his eyes . So , naturally , I supplied my own rebuke , and it would be as permanent as his condition . Michael would not walk at all for a year . And without , first , crutches , then leg braces and a cane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that this illness would forever mark the defining moment of his life , and we did . But only for six years , when the absolute line dividing before from after mine as much as his was drawn . As the nurse in the polio ward said I would , I found Edie that night in the darkened cathedral a short walk down Amsterdam Avenue from St. Luke 's . The nurse told me that Edie had been at Michael 's side nearly all the time . Only after he was firmly asleep would she go over to the hulking church , leaving the nurse with the impression that she needed to pray . ' Your son will need you , Mr. Montgomery , ' the nurse presumed to say to me , ' but so will your wife . ' Edie was a confirmed Episcopalian , but she had never been devout , and I could not imagine her on her knees . She loved the cathedral , but in the way American patricians love Gothic spaces . We had been married there , and her father had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month , she had found her way to St. Joh Divine , but for vespers ; she preferred the evening service of chanted psalms to the more showy morning communion . We presumed Michael inherited his religious indifference from me , but what Edie really preferred , I knew , were the soaring shadows of night the feeling of being in Chartres , in the heart of human genius more than in the presence of some divinity . It was no surprise to me that she would seek rest and refuge there . But prayer ? I found her at a side altar , sitting in front of a shrouded statue of what I took to be the sorrowful mother of God . Approaching from behind , not wanting to startle her , I whispered her name tentatively . In truth , I half expected a rebuke from Edie , too . She could be angry and unforgiving , and in our twelve years of marriage I had had my moments of both resenting her reactions and fearing them . Why the hell were you in Paris when our son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she stood and turned to me , her hands clutching at her mouth . She fell into my arms with a desperation I could not have imagined . ' Oh , Monty ! ' she said . ' Monty ' was her teasing endearment for me teasing because she knew that from anyone else I hated it . We were not nickname people her name was Edie , not Edith which is why we called our son Michael , and only that . Edie was trying to speak to me , but her sobbing made it impossible . ' Monty , ' she said again , and the only other word that made it through her lips was ' Michael . ' The two names prompted in me the sweet thought that her love for her son and her love for her husband had become the same thing , and further thought , holding her as she shuddered against me , that that was how I felt . What to her was a moment only of unspeakable anguish was to me a revelation of this most basic fact of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For me , our son 's illness , evoking that love , would be an axis around which our otherwise separate lives turned as one life . But for Edie , it would be something else entirely . She abruptly pulled back from me , as if offended by my physical resoluteness . Her eyes were wrecked , bloodshot , foolishly stained with mascara , crazy looking . ' I ca n't , ' she said . ' Ca n't what ? ' I asked . ' Cope , ' she said . ' Cope with this . I ca n't . ' ' Yes you can . ' I pulled her back into my embrace not to console her but to avoid having to look into her terrified eyes . I was right , of course . Edie coped magnificently from then on . She was at Michael 's service morning , noon , and night , as his masseuse , his physical therapist , his coach , his tutor enabling him to stay at class level in school . She was his motivation , the soul , ultimately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edie 's stalwart love , and Michael would worship her for it , which he showed by getting steadily better . All of which was more than enough for me . But in the one thing with which heroic Edie needed help the thing that nurse had sensed I was useless . In the cathedral that night she had shown me her terror , and I could not look at it . I could not stand it . Left alone , she coped with it by means of a savage act of will , which left her feeling , I see now , lik instead of loving . She reproached herself for dutifulness , for the rigid discipline of her care , for doing what she could for Michael because she should . All of which , of course , defines love at its truest . But for Edie the former ease of spirited affection and maternal fondness had suffocated in the fumes of rubbing alcohol and the stink of soiled bandages and pus-stained plaster casts and the dead skin of our son 's inert legs , as she worked all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside Edie , it seemed , had turned to stone . The one acute feeling she would allow herself from then on was that of self-loathing , which I beheld clear as day every time she exploded in anger never at Michael or in his presence ; always , apparently , at me , in mine ; but , I realized later , really at herself . Unconsciously , she was recruiting me to punish her , and I was capable of exploding back , alas . But even when , as was mostly true , I maintained a relative equanimity , she took it as a signal of my detachment . She angrily charged me with detachment , not from Michael but from her , which was how little she had come to know of me . This was the emotional impasse at which we had found ourselves when the question arose of my transfer to Germany . As events unfolded , I started the job in Frankfurt at the end of the summer without Edie . The assignment , not a major promotion but the prerequisite to one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface , Edie , Michael , and I had all been looking forward to it the transatlantic passage on the USS America , a month 's travel across the Continent before settling the privileged life of postwar American supremacy . But below the surface , our family was in turmoil , stirred by every decision involving Michael . After six arduous years of corrective operations and physical therapy , all organized around his ongoing schoolwork , he was doing well far better than we 'd dared to hope . Walking confidently with his leg braces and elbow cane , working hard to think of himself as other than crippled , our son was , in effect , recovered from polio , and had learned to manage what it had left him with . Edie and I , in our separate ways , had arranged our lives around what he needed from us , but what he needed from us had changed . Edie and I came more slowly to knowing that than he did . Taking a large clue from him , we had finally settled on a plan that called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September , so that he could complete his senior year at St. Dunstan 's , his prep school in Riverdale , but now as a boarding student . Polio had tempered Michael 's exuberant personality , but we were able in the end to see that what others took for shy insecurity was in fact the quiet resolve that had seen him through . We knew that he was ready for life apart from us knowledge that Edie and I separately resisted . But now he was a senior at Wiesbaden High School , an hour away from me . We had decided together , in the end , that I would take the job in Germany after all and that he would go too . As it turned out , the jovial atmosphere of a self-consciously American high school cheerleaders ! pep rallies ! was far better for him than the faux cloister of an prep school . His boarding five days a week at Wiesbaden seemed about right , and his coming to be with me in Frankfurt on most weekends did move us to a new , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had formed a habit of taking long Saturday drives in our new blue Ford convertible . We explored the winding roads , hillside vineyards , and hock towns of the Rhineland wine country . We visited half-reconstructed river cities from Mainz to Koblenz to Cologne . We went several times to the Roman ruins at Trier , a small city that had been home to the emperor Constantine and , even more remarkable to us , to Karl Marx . In November , Michael turned seventeen , the permit age in Germany , and after that he took the wheel more often than I did . The pleasure I took in riding beside him in the passenger seat was , I see now , an unconscious return to the games of wheels that had been such a bond years before . I do n't recall ever giving him driving lessons as such , and in Germany there was no question of driving school . Even with those leg braces , his body seemed naturally to know what to do , and his right leg on the pedals was his better leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical grace returned . That Michael was relaxed as a driver relieved me , and the routine of those jaunts soothed us . In the car , especially with the top down , we felt no need to force conversation , and a certain self-isolating silence came to seem all right . It was our silence together . By the spring of that year , in other words , we had each found reasons to regard our weekends as the matter of a mutual compact , not something either of us wo violate lightly . Ironically , it was also then that we began , for the first time , to differ about things , first small things , then larger ones . I knew enough to anticipate mundane teenage moodiness , but the weight on Michael was heavier than that , which I understood . But there were things I did n't understand . The gulf that opened between us came as a disheartening surprise . The silence of our rides , I began to sense , carried an undertone of my son 's resentment , which mystified me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marx had been misunderstood , and that the only trouble with his ideas was they had n't really been tried . ' That 's ridiculous , ' I snapped , and he shot back , ' What would a banker know about the real meaning of Karl Marx ? ' His direct challenge , offered with the pristine self-righteousness of a committed leftist , so shocked me that at first I could not reply . ' Deutsche marks , ' I then deflected , as Edie would have , ' not Karl . ' But I wondered where the hell this was coming from . Soon enough I would know . In fact , at the beginning of that week we 'd had what you 'd have to call an outright argument , sparked by his resentment at my first saying no , he could not take the car if it violated school rules . ' Do n't treat me like a cripple ! ' he had blurted , as if my mere enforcement of a rule did any such thing . But the statement stunned us both , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of anger forced me to back off . I let him take the car despite myself , but he had still gone off angry , leaving me to fume even more . I recalled that with horror now , because that was how had gone off . Michael , where are you ? Friday afternoons at Wiesbaden were marked , as I imagined it , by an explosion of pent-up all-American energy boys heading out to the ball field , girls in the gym putting up crepe-paper streamers for the sock hop , kids in dungarees and pedal pushers going over to the teen club to feed the jukebox and the Coke machine . I pictured it all from my place at the large bow-front window looking across the garden toward Mosbacher Strasse , and the happy images of young people at play undid me . I took in the teeth a blast of new self-reproach . So Michael wanted to stay over in Wiesbaden and what , go to the big game the next day ? Or take a date to the American movie theater at the base exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did n't dance ? And why not with a car ? Why had I let that become an issue ? And what was it about me that sparked anger in those I loved ? Did his failure to show up now mean he was still angry ? Was this my punishment for the real offense , which he had dared to name , that I did treat him like a cripple ? Michael , where are you ? The clock was striking again , and to my surprise , the half-conscious count I kept brought me to seven . Seven o'clock . It was nearly dark outside . He was n't here , and he had n't called . If there 'd been a wreck , would the German police have a way of knowing to call here ? The thought of the German police brought me back to the scene in Rhine-Main Hall on the previous Monday , what I had been reading about , what I had witnessed . I replayed it the intruder coming up behind the tall G touch the back of his neck ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ podium , that red spray . The gunman disappeared through the curtain as quickly as he had come . In short order , the green-uniformed police arrived , the meeting was adjourned , and I returned to my office , where , almost at once , I began to wonder if I had imagined it all . The dead man had been identified in the program as Markus von Siedelheim , a name that meant nothing to me at the time . The killer had escaped . I gathered from several days ' deciphering of the Neue Presse and from talk at the office that the police 's assumption was that von Siedelheim had been murdered by crackpot revolutionary elements who saw new economic ties between Germany and Liberia as a renewal of imperialist adventurism or perhaps by rightists who opposed German participation in the recently chartered Common Market , of which the ECSC was a forerunner . The theories made no sense to me at the time , although such acts of political violence would become common in a few years , with the arrival of the Red Brigade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups on the right . What jolted me instead was the rank senselessness of the act it was von Siedelheim 's first return to Germany in seven years . In an odd way , the murder epitomized the feeling we all had then of living on the edge of an abyss . That was literally true in Germany , with divisions of Soviet tanks poised to strike at any moment , igniting Armageddon . But the feared violence of the Cold War could be denoted by nothing so rational as the later political radicalism , f kind of moral anarchy had come to undergird the East- West standoff , even if we could not openly see it as such . If there was a car wreck , I realized , the police would call the school . I went to the foyer , to the telephone , and checking the list that Mandy , my secretary , had typed and taped into cellophane nearly nine months before , I found the number of the hall phone in Michael 's dormitory . When the operator came on , I recited it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The odd , blasting rings went on and on . Finally someone answered , a boy whose accent dropped me back to Mobile , Alabama , where I 'd done Navy boot camp as a twenty-year-old , more than twenty years before . I asked for Michael Montgomery . The boy grunted and the phone clattered down . I could picture the handset dropping , slapping the wall at the end of its cord . Bright noises in the echo chamber of the corridor made me see a rough game of keepaway . At last yet another boy New Jersey ? came on the line to say that Montgomery was a ' fiver , ' as if that explained everything . I knew that about half of the dormitory students who were themselves a minority in the school were five-day boarders , routinely going home on Fridays to American posts , bases , and stations within a couple of hours of Wiesbaden . I asked the boy if he was sure Michael Montgomery was not there . He said yes , and was about to hang up . I declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He went to check again , leaving the phone to bang against the wall . After another few minutes , he returned to say that Michael was nowhere a that if he 'd stayed over , they would have seen him in the caf at dinner , but nobody had . I asked if there was a dance that night or a big game the next day , and took what I needed from his answer that he did n't know . I hung up before he did . Where are you ? Once , at our place in the Adirondacks , Michael and I stayed up late into the night , sitting on the deck of the boathouse with our feet dangling in the lake . He was around eight years old , two years or so before his polio . What kept us up was a sequence of shooting stars . At irregular intervals they crossed the black sky beyond the even blacker silhouette of Mount Marcy . What made the sight doubly thrilling was the way the night sky was reflected in the cobalt sheen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the stars by looking down as well as up . Every falling star had its twin until one or the other of us raised a foot to break the glass of the lake surface , an impulse coming , perhaps , from a need to remember which of the realms before us was real . In the rippling water , the stars danced . ' Will we ever do this again , Dad ? ' Michael asked at one point .
