<p> Augusta  --  In time for the Masters , another Augusta landmark is all dressed up , waiting for its annual entourage of golfing guests . <p> The Partridge Inn , a fixture in the city 's historic Summerville neighborhood since the 1870s , late last year completed a $17 million makeover . <p> As befitting a lady of her years , the Partridge 's redo was designed to subtly enhance her beauty and classic lines . The new owner , West Paces Hotel Group , headed by former Ritz-Carlton Hotels President Horst Schulze , has updated the color scheme inside and out . A sunny yellow shade , complementing the inn 's magnolias and landscaping , has replaced the former salmon pink hue , grown dingy and faded over the years . <p> Echoing the plush grounds of the neighboring Augusta National Golf Club , home of the Masters , interiors have been refreshed in earthy sage , cream , forest brown and rust tones . <p> The inn 's 145 guest rooms , including 54 suites , have been refurnished and equipped with complimentary high-speed Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee makers , hair dryers , triple-sheeted beds , and overstuffed chairs and sofas . <p> The four-guest room Penthouse Suite has a full modern kitchen , wet bars and views of the city , below " the Hill , " as the Summerville neighborhood is known . <p> Like a genteel old Southern home , a quarter-mile of open verandas and galleries are the Partridge 's signature . Guests at the Verandah Grill , the hotel 's main restaurant and bar , can enjoy buffet breakfast and lunch , popular Sunday brunch and dinnertime New Southern and American cuisine and live music with fresh air and unobstructed views of the magnolia trees . <p> The spirit of a former guest named Emily reputedly hangs around the top of a closed-off stairway at the restaurant 's entrance . <p> An unfaithful suitor broke her heart , but she 's a friendly ghost , says a hotel staffer . Perhaps Emily 's longing for love inspires the Verandah 's raft of marriage proposals  --  four on Valentine 's Day . <p> On the renovations ' downside , the Bamboo Room martini bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillipe Chin 's French/Asian fusion cuisine , has closed . Chin is opening a French restaurant across the Savannah River in Aiken , S.C. , and his former digs will probably become a private function room . <p> The first-floor lobby has been doubled , with seating arrangements , a small business center and big windows letting in natural light and views of Walton Way . A fitness center , a ballroom , five meeting rooms , and an outdoor pool and landscaped courtyard are adjacent to the lobby . <p> The hotel was originally a two-story residence of the Walton family , one of whose members ( George Walton ) was one of Georgia 's three Declaration of Independence signers . It was purchased in the late 1800s by New York hotel man Morris Partridge , who expanded it to its present size in 1929 . A New York contemporary of Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Partridge 's distinguishing twin towers and verandas . <p> " You do n't typically find hotels of this caliber still functioning today , " says general manager Jeff Brower . " It has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has hosted Rockefellers and other wealthy Northern winter snowbirds , who came down for golf , fox hunting and other sports . The Masters Tournament is located here largely because of Augusta 's prominence as a wintering place . <p> " The heyday was from the early 1900s to 1940 . They came with trunks and servants and stayed the whole season , " Brower says . " When the railroad pushed on into Florida , most of the Northerners went with it , to Palm Beach and Miami . But the reputation of Augusta and the Partridge as a place to spend the winter was already made . " <p> In 1921 , President-elect Warren G. Harding held one of his round-robin pre-inaugural dinners in the hotel 's ballroom . Harding and his party reputedly dined on fried chicken , baked possum and sweet potatoes and other regional specialties . <p> Fried chicken is still on the luncheon menu , but executive chef Bradley Czajka 's New Southern evening fare dispenses with the possum . It features Charleston-style she-crab bisque , blackened shrimp and scallops over creamy goat cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seafood . <p> While you 're here <p> Downtown Augusta 's attractions are about 10 minutes down Walton Way . In the 1980s , a 19th-century flood containment levee on the Savannah River was developed into Riverwalk , a 10-block promenade and public park with an art museum and science museum at either end .
