<p> Volcanoes evoke images of black , bubbling lava in Hawaii or steaming hot springs in California 's Lassen Volcanic National Park . <p> But volcanic rock in the Berkeley hills ? Yup , and plenty of it . <p> The creamy-yellowish rock , known as Northbrae rhyolite , is scattered throughout a quiet residential area called Thousand Oaks , adding a geological touch to private gardens and corner parks . <p> Some of the rocks are the size of a bread box , neatly layered to create a sidewalk retaining wall or a set of front steps . Others are at least a story high , some with pathways running through , inviting to kids who want to scramble up as well as climbers breaking in new equipment . <p> The largest formations are the centerpieces for a number of small parks that dot the area . But perhaps the most intriguing are those that have been incorporated into people 's homes  --  in the foundation , walls and gardens . <p> " People either buy the houses because of the rocks or they learn to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is working on a book about the volcanic rock called " Berkeley Rocks . " He estimates that hundreds of homes in the area have Northbrae rhyolite on the premises . One homeowner even used it as material for a shower wall . <p> The bedrock outcrops are the result of eruptions 11.5 million years agofrom volcanoes south of San Jose , most likely related to a volcanic field northeast of Hollister . " Exactly how many it 's hard to say , but it 's probably more than one volcano , " said Steve Edwards , director of Regional Parks Botanic Garden who , as a UC Berkeley graduate student , did field mapping of Round Top , a volcano in Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserve in the Oakland hills . <p> He called the volcanic rock in the Berkeley Hills fascinating , transported to its current location by movement along the Hayward and Calaveras fault lines . <p> Lin Murphy , who researched Northbrae rhyolite while earning her master 's degree at Cal State Hayward , concluded that Northbrae rhyolite is distinct from volcanic rock found in Sibley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white flow bands that show how the lava erupted . <p> Because of its apparent movement along the fault lines , the rock is rich with silica , creating an especially hard substance . <p> " That 's my explanation for why Indian Rock is so much better to climb on because it has so much in it and it keeps it from falling apart , " said Murphy , who now lives in Colorado , referring to one of the largest outcroppings . <p> In 1914 , Andrew Lawson , a geology professor at UC Berkeley who mapped the San Andreas and Hayward faults , discovered the rhyolite while training his students to do geological field mapping . <p> He named it Northbrae rhyolite after the surrounding neighborhood . <p> " It 's there and it 's beautiful , and you do n't have to go to the mountains , " said Barbara Robben , who recently led a walk through the volcanic rock for the Berkeley Path Wanderers Association , one of several groups that offer tours of volcanic rock in the area . <p> Four hikers recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Johnson , a Berkeley resident and volunteer tour leader for Greenbelt Alliance , a conservation group that offers free hikes year-round . <p> The walk began at the Great Stone Face Park , which occupies a corner of a quiet residential area that overlooks the bay . On the edge of a gentle slope of grass is a volcanic formation about 15 feet high with just enough crevices and indentations to make it perfect for climbing . Smaller boulders nearby create unexpected pathways . <p> The park is one of a handful that were donated to the city of Berkeley by real estate developer Duncan McDuffie in the early 1900s when he was designing the Northbrae neighborhood . <p> McDuffie practiced a philosophy of linking natural features of the area with architectural designs , whether it meant mapping circles around trees , setting aside public parks , or sprinkling developments among multi-story volcanic rocks . <p> The area was developed during Berkeley 's architectural renaissance when Bernard Maybeck , Julia Morgan and others designers trained in the Beaux Arts tradition followed the " building with nature " style , creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . <p> " Instead of shying away from it , they embraced the natural features and made it part of the excitement of the house and the drama of the architecture , " said Lesley Emmington of the Berkeley Architectural Heritage Foundation . " It was just a wonderful time of creativity and embracing the East Bay and the hillsides . " <p> A short walk from Great Stone Face Park is a home that illustrates the easy blend of architecture and rock . At the entrance of a shady Julie Morgan home , large outcroppings loom on either side of the front steps , adding a dramatic dimension to the landscape . <p> The area is brimming with rocks . Retaining walls made of volcanic formations stretch on for blocks , a buffer for an array of California Craftsman homes , English Tudors and those influenced by European styles . <p> As the walkers made their way along Yosemite Road , they occasionally would peek through the front gates and spot a large volcanic rock on the side of a garden surrounded by grass , shrubs and colorful perennials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a driveway that wound its way up and around a huge volcanic mass . The rock occupied almost the entire front yard , surrounded by ferns , cypress shrubs , and Japanese maples . <p> " We called it the boulder home , " said the new homeowner who was just moving in . The owner , who did n't want to give her name , said that the rock was definitely part of the attraction of the house , adding that her son likes to climb through a path that runs through the middle of the formation . " They 're magnificent , solid , timeless . " <p> As Johnson led the group farther down the Alameda , they spied a variety of volcanic rocks , some no more than a hump , others tall enough to mingle with the trees . One house was built in an L-shape around a huge outcropping , while another had used it to create a steaming sauna . Several street sign pillars were made of the ubiquitous rock . <p> " To see what people do with them is quite fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chimney made out of stacks of rocks . <p> Johnson led the group to Contra Costa Rock Park , an area dominated by a large outcropping big enough to climb on with a postage-stamp lawn in the back . Bruce Simon of Berkeley and his dog , Tessie , were perched on the top , savoring the shimmering view of the bay . " It 's just part of our regular neighborhood walk with no crowds , " he said . <p> The walkers made their way up Indian Rock Path , one of hundreds of paths that wind their way through the hills , until they arrived at Indian Rock . The largest of the Northbrae rhyolite , it was donated to the city of Berkeley in 1917 by McDuffie and is steeped with rock climbing lore . Dick Leonard , regarded as the father of modern rock climbing , and noted environmentalist David Brower developed their rock climbing skills here . <p> Winding steps are chiseled on the sides , leading climbers up to one of the best views of the Bay Area . <p> A short distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rhyolite surrounded by California buckeye and live oak trees . Holes still remain where Ohlone Indians ground acorns , a remnant of the area 's rich history <p> " They 're amazing natural , architectural features , " said Nancy Shapiro , a longtime Berkeley resident , as she watched her dog , Cookie , scramble up on one of the rock formations . <p> " Visually and tactically , they give a great texture to the neighborhood , " she said . " They 're just great surprises . " <p> Rock on <p> Berkeley Path Wanderers puts out a map showing the volcanic rock parks as well as pedestrian paths to reach them .
