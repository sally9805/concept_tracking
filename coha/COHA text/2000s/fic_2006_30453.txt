Chapter One the honeymooners " Good morning , madam ! " trilled a female voice in a super-perky British accent . Blair Waldorf sighed and turned over onto her side . She 'd been in London three days but still was n't over her jet lag . She did n't mind , though : it was a small price to pay to see her movie-star-handsome , **27;1586;TOOLONG boyfriend , Lord Marcus . Wendy , one of the three maids whose round-the-clock services came with Blair 's penthouse suite at Claridge 's , clacked across the blond parquet floors and deposited a heavy mahogany tray onto the king-size bed , which was so big Blair had divided it up into four sections : one for sleeping , one for eating , one for watching TV , and one for sex . So far , that section had remained unused . Wendy drew the thick maroon velvet curtains on the massive wall of windows , flooding the enormous room with light . It reflected off the opulent goldfiligree ceiling and bounced off the gilded mirrors that lined the attached dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the six sumptuous goosedown pillows over her head to shield her eyes from the sun . " Breakfast as requested , Miss Waldorf , " announced Wendy , lifting the silver cover off the tray to reveal a barfy-looking mush of watery scrambled eggs , massive greasy sausages , and a pool of stewed tomatoes . Classic English cuisine . Yum . Blair smoothed her tousled chestnut hair and straightened the straps of the soft pink Hanro cami she 'd worn to bed . The food looked disgusting but smelled delicious . Oh well , she deserved a little treat , did n't she ? She 'd worked up an appetite the day before , walking around West London sightseeing . If you call Harrods , Harvey Nichols , and Whistles sights . " And your paper , " added Wendy setting the International Herald Tribune on the tray with a flourish . Blair had requested the daily paper when she checked in-a Yale woman had to keep up on world events , after all . So what if she had n't exactly gotten around to the reading part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primly . Blair nodded and the maid disappeared into the sitting room . Blair speared one of the huge sausages with her fork and picked up the paper , skimming the front page . But the tiny typeface and matter-of-fact photographs were so boring she could n't concentrate . The only paper she ever read was the Sunday Styles section of the New York Times , if only to scan the charity event pictures for familiar faces . Why would a worldly woman like herself need to read world news , anyway ? She was world news . Blair had always been impulsive , but her presence in London had actually been Marcus 's idea . His graduation present to her-other than the ridiculously extravagant Bvlgari earrings-had been a plane ticket to London . Blair had envisioned rainy weeks locked in his enormous stone castle having chain-sex-the equivalent of chain-smoking-stopping only to gnaw on a cold leg of mutton or whatever medieval snack was stored in the castle 's primitive but well-stocked kitchen . But Marcus had been so busy working for his dad all he ever had time for was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the floor , she scanned her bedside table for British Vogue-she 'd stocked up on all the English magazines so she 'd know what to buy and where to buy it-when her new razor-thin Vertu phone chimed prettily . There was only one person who had her new London telephone number . " Hello ? " she answered as sexily as she could with a mouth full of scrambled egg . " Darling , " Lord Marcus Beaton-Rhodes greeted her in his charming British accent . " I 'm coming round . Just wanted to make sure you were up , love . " " I 'm up , I 'm up ! " Blair was unable to control her excitement . She 'd spent the last two nights alone , and her horniness was bubbling over into near-frenzy . How they 'd made it this far without actually doing it , she was n't sure . Was this their chance for a morning interlude sans knickers ? " Right , " he continued in his charmingly straightforward way . " I 'll be by shortly . And I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giddily as she shut her phone . That was just the kind of wake-up call she needed to get her out of bed . She scurried to the bathroom , discarding clothes as she went . Could it be roses and caviar ? Chilled champagne and oysters ? It was kind of early in the morning for that , but judging from the last present he 'd given her-the Bvlgari pearl earrings , with their dangling gold Bs-it was bound to be good . Some equally exquisite symbol of his undying love ? Everyone back in New York was so insanely jealous of her perfect English boyfriend that they 'd spread rumors Marcus was already engaged . There was only one way to put that rumor to rest forever : return to New York wearing his ring . Preferably a flawless , four-carat , emerald-cut diamond , although an old family heirloom would do . How humble of her . Lord Marcus had initially invited her to spend the summer at his father 's Knightsbridge mansion , but when he 'd picked her up from Heathrow in his chauffeur-driven cream-colored Bentley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We simply have n't got the room , sweetheart , " Marcus whispered directly into her ear , his hot breath sending shivers down her spine as the desk attendant handed her the room key . " Plus , when I come over , we 'll have complete privacy . " Well , that 's hard to argue with . Blair was n't sure what Marcus 's dad did for a living , but it had something do with bonds , and whatever it was sounded very boring . Marcus was interning at his dad 's office for the summer , and late nights and early mornings meant he had hardly any energy for ... sex . Blair had only done it a few times with Nate Archibald , and she was beyond eager to try it with someone older and more experienced , like Marcus-not that sex with Nate had been so bad . Her rosemary La Mer bath tonic and minty Marvis toothpaste masking the stink of scrambled egg and tomato , she hurried back to the bedroom and hopped into bed , wearing only a light sheen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bvlgari earrings she had n't taken off once since her graduation party at the Yale Club a little over two weeks ago . After ditching Vanessa Abrams 's small apartment in dingy and weird Williamsburg , with no intention of moving back to the crazy world she used to call home , Blair had decided to live at the Yale club . She and Lord Marcus had met in the elevator , and his hot accent and neatly ironed jeans had gotten to her right away . Fate had it that their rooms were side by side , and she could imagine the feel of his sexy English breath on her neck even before they 'd kissed-which had happened that very night . After pouring her heart out to him over six or seven cosmos , Blair was so sure she 'd found the love of her life , she practically threw herself at him . She was too tipsy- and he was too much of a gentleman-to do more than kiss . But all that was about to change . Blair draped the sheets over her body and lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm on my honeymoon and worn out from doing it , but what the hell , let 's do it again . She grabbed the newspaper off of the floor and propped up the front page so it looked like she was reading it . There . Perfect . An intellectual sexpot . A worldly woman who read all about international crises-and preferred to discuss said crises in bed . If only she had a pair of vintage fifties reading glasses to perch on the tip of her nose . All the better to see you naked with ! As if on cue , Lord Marcus flung the bedroom door open and Blair turned her head slowly , as if she could barely stand to break away from the current poultry deficit in Asia . He was wearing a perfectly tailored charcoal summer suit with an olive James Perse T-shirt underneath that made his striking green eyes look serious and deep and oh-so-promising . " What 's this , then ? " he asked , furrowing his golden-brown eyebrows . " Remember I said I had a surprise ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blair cooed sexily . " Come look under the sheets . " " Right , " he continued a little impatiently . " Well , put on your clothes , love . " " I do n't want to , " Blair complained , pouting . He hurried across the room and kissed her quickly on the nose . " Later , " he promised . " Now throw on some clothes and meet me downstairs in the lobby . " Then he turned and left the room , leaving her perfumed , well-moisturized , and depilated body naked and alone . This better be a good surprise . Blair emerged from the wood-paneled elevator in a hastily chosen ensemble : a chocolate brown Tory Burch tunic ( thank you , Harrods ) , a favorite pair of old True Religion jeans , and clunky gold Marc by Marc Jacobs clogs . She looked like a jetsetter on holiday . Just right for a weekend jaunt to Tunis in Lord Marcus 's private jet . Could that be the surprise ? The grand , chandelier-lit marble hotel lobby was abuzz with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd as she crossed the tiled floor , her clogs clopping noisily , to the overstuffed black velvet chaise where Marcus sat waiting for her . He was so goddamn handsome Blair could n't help admiring him , like he was a painting or some rare piece of sculpture , and it was hard to resist plunging her fingers into the thick waves of his golden-brown hair . She was so busy mentally rhapsodizing over her gorgeous English lover that she barely noticed he was holding hands with someone who was definitely not her . Ding , ding . Hello ? Forgetting the romantic jaunt to Africa , Blair 's eyes narrowed at the horsy blonde holding her boyfriend 's hand . What the fuck ? " Blair , at last , " Lord Marcus greeted her smoothly , standing but not letting go of his companion 's hand . " This , my dear , is my darling cousin Camilla , the one I told you about . My soul mate . She 's in town for a couple of weeks . We were practically twins growing up ! Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " echoed Blair , throwing herself onto a nearby armchair . She did n't remember hearing anything about any cousin Camilla . But then , listening had never been her strong suit . " I 'm so delighted to meet you , " said Camilla , staring down her long , prominent nose-the kind of schnozz even the best plastic surgeon could n't fix . Her pale English complexion was layered with comical amounts of beige powder and primaryred blush . Her legs were clownishly long and skinny , like she 'd been stretched on one of those old-fashioned lengthening machines Blair had tried to find on eBay . " Mimi just turned up yesterday morning , unannounced , " Lord Marcus explained . " Imagine , like a lost waif , with bags in hand . " He chuckled . " Yes , well , thankfully I can count on my dear Mar-mar to open up his home to me , " Camilla gushed , casually running her free hand through her long , flaxen hair . Hair that could easily be cut off in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place ? " demanded Blair rudely , already hating the crooked-toothed Camilla and her ugly yellow Indian silk sundress , which probably cost thousands but looked like a tablecloth . " But I thought there was n't room . " " There 's always room for family , " Lord Marcus answered , squeezing Camilla 's talon-like hand before turning back to Blair . " Not to worry , sweetheart . We 'll all have a grand time together . " Sure they will . ( Continues ... )
