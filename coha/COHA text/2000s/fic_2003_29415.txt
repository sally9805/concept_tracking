June 2224 People tend to believe that good fortune consists of equal parts talent , hard work , and sheer luck . It 's hard to deny the roles of the latter two . As to talent , I would only say it consists primarily in finding the right moment to step in.  - -  Haroun al Monides , REFLECTIONS , 2116 PRISCILLA HUTCHINS WAS not a woman to be swept easily off her feet , but she came very close to developing a terminal passion for Preacher Brawley during the Proteus fiasco . Not because of his good looks , though God knew he was a charmer . And not because of his congeniality . She 'd always liked him , for both those reasons . If pressed , though , she would probably have told you it had to do with his timing . He was n't really a preacher , of course , but was , according to legend , descended from a long line of Baptist fire breathers . Hutch knew him as an occasional dinner companion , a person she saw occasionally coming in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a voice from the void on those interminable flights to Serenity and Glory Point and Faraway . He was one of those rare individuals with whom one could be silent , and still feel in good company . The important thing was that he had been there when she desperately needed him . Not to save her life , mind you . She was never in real danger herself . But he took a terrible decision out of her hands . The way it happened was this : Hutch was aboard the Academy ship Wildside en route to Renaissance Station , which orbited Proteus , a vast hydrogen cloud that had been contracting for millions of years and would eventually become a star . Its core was burning furiously under thepressures generated by that contraction , but nuclear ignition had not yet taken place . That was why the station was there . To watch , as Lawrence Dimenna liked to say , the process . But there were those who felt Renaissance was vulnerable , that the process was unpredictable , and who 'd attempted to close it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place Hutch was anxious to visit . The wind blew all the time inside the cloud . She was about a day away , listening to it howl and claw at her ship . She was trying to concentrate on a light breakfast of toast and fruit when she saw the first sign of what was to come.It 's thrown off a big flare , " said Bill . " Gigantic , " he added . " Off the scale . " Unlike his sibling AI on the Benjamin Martin , Hutch 's Bill adopted a wide range of appearances , using whatever he felt most likely to please , annoy , or intimidate , as the mood struck him . Theoretically , he was programmed to do so , to provide the captain with a true companion on long flights . She was otherwise alone on the ship . At the moment , he looked like the uncle that everybody likes but who has a tendency to drink a bit too much and who has an all-too-obvious eye for women . " You think we 're actually going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have sufficient data to make a decent estimate , " he said . " But I 'd think not . I mean , the place has been here a long time . Surely it wo n't blow up just as we arrive . " It was an epitaph if she 'd ever heard one . They could n't see the eruption without sensors , of course . Could n't see anything without sensors . The glowing mist through which the Wildside moved prevented any visuals much beyond thirty kilometers . It was hydrogen , illuminated by the fire at the core . On her screens , Proteus was not easily distinguishable from a true star , save for the twin jets that rose out of its poles . Hutch looked at the display images , at the vast bursts of flame roiling through the clouds , at the inferno rendered somehow more disquieting than that of a true star , perhaps because it had not even the illusion of a definable edge , but rather seemed to fill the universe . When seen from outside the cloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of a Sorbanne , beams composed of charged particles , not entirely stable , flashed from a cosmic lighthouse that occasionally changed its position on the rocks . Renaissance Station had been placed in an equatorial orbit to lessen the possibility that a stray blast would take out its electronics . " When do they expect the nuclear engine to cut in ? " she asked . " Probably not for another thousand years , " said Bill . " These people must be crazy , sitting out here in this soup . " " Apparently conditions have worsened considerably during the past forty-eight hours . " Bill gazed down at her in his smugly superior mode and produced a noteboard . " It says here they have a comfortable arrangement . Pools , tennis courts , parks . Even a seaside retreat . " Had Proteus been at the heart of the solar system , the thin haze of its outer extremities would have engulfed Venus . Well , maybe engulfed was n't quite the right word . Enshrouded , maybe . Eventually , when the pressure reached critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hydrogen would be blown away , and Proteus would become a class-G , possibly a bit more massive than the sun . " Does n't really matter how many parks they have if that thing has gone unstable . " The AI let her see that he disapproved . " There is no known case of a class-G protostar going unstable . It is subject to occasional storms , and that is what we are seeing now . I think you are unduly worried . " " Maybe . But if this is normal weather , I would n't want to be here when things get rough . " " Nor would I. But if a problem develops while we 're there , we should be able to outrun it easily enough . " Let 's hope . It was unlikely , the dispatching officer had assured her , that an Event would occur . ( He had clearly capitalized the word . ) Proteus was just going through a hiccup period . Happens all the time . No reason to worry , Hutchins . You 're there simply as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting refitted , when the call had come . Lawrence Dimenna , the director of Renaissance Station , the same Dimenna who 'd insisted just two months ago that Proteus was perfectly safe , as dependable as the sun , who 'd argued to keep the place going against the advice of some of the top people at the Academy , was now asking for insurance . So let 's send old Hutchins over to sit on the volcano . And here she was . With instructions to stand by and hold Dimenna 's hand and if there 's a problem , see that everyone gets off . But there should n't be a problem . I mean , they 're the experts on protostars and they say everything 's fine . Just taking a precaution . She 'd checked the roster . There were thirty-three crew , staff , and working researchers , including three graduate students . Accommodations on the Wildside would be a bit tight if they had to run . The ship was designed for thirty-one plus the pilot , but they could double up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be pressed into service during acceleration and jump phases . It was a temporary assignment , until the Academy could get the Lochran out from Earth . The Lochran was being overhauled -- armored , really -- to better withstand conditions here and would replace her as the permanent escape vessel within a few weeks . " Hutch , " said Bill . " We have incoming . From Renaissance . " She was on the bridge , which was where she spent most of her time when riding an otherwise empty ship . " Patch them through , " she said . " About time we got acquainted . " It was a pleasant surprise . She found herself looking at a gorgeous young technician with chestnut hair , luminous eyes , and a smile that lit up when there 'd been time for the signal to pass back and forth and he got a look at her . He wore a white form-fitting shirt and Hutch had to smother a sigh . Damn . She 'd been alone too long . " Hello , Wildside , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She restrained a smile . The exchange of signals required slightly more than a minute . " Dr. Harper wants to talk to you . " He gave way to a tall , dark woman who looked accustomed to giving people directions . Hutch recognized Mary Harper from the media reports . She owned a clipped voice and looked at Hutch the way Hutch might have glanced at a kid bringing the lunch in late . Harper had stood shoulder to shoulder with Dimenna during the long battle to prevent the closing of the station . " Captain Hutchins ? We 're glad you 're here . It 'll make everyone feel a bit more secure to know there 's a ship standing by . Just in case . " " Glad to be of service , " Hutch said . She softened a bit . " I understand you were headed home before this came up , and I just wanted you to know that we appreciate your coming out here on short notice . There 's probably no need , but we thought it best to be cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something else but the transmission was blown away by the storm . Bill tried a few alternate channels and found one that worked . " When can we expect you ? " she asked . " Tomorrow morning at about six looks good . " Harper was worried , but she tried to hide it behind that cool smile while she waited for Hutch 's response to reach her . When it did she nodded , and Hutch got the distinct impression that back behind her eyes the woman was counting . " Good , " she said with bureaucratic cheerfulness . " We 'll see you then . " We do n't get many visitors out this way , Hutch thought . THE STATION MADE periodic reports to Serenity , recording temperature readings at various levels of the atmosphere , gravity fluctuations , contraction rate estimates , cloud density , and a myriad other details . The Wildside had drifted into the hypercomm data stream between Renaissance and Serenity and was consequently able , for a few minutes , to pick up the transmissions . Hutch watched the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis by the Renaissance AI . None of it was intelligible to her . Core temperatures and wind velocities were just weather reports . But there were occasional images of the protostar , embedded at the heart of the cloud . " How sure are they , " she asked Bill , " that ignition wo n't happen for a thousand years ? " " They 're not giving opinions at the moment , " he said . " But as I understand it , there 's a possibility the nuclear engine could already have started . In fact , it could have started as much as two hundred years ago . " " And they would n't know it ? " " No . " " I 'd assumed when that happened the protostar would more or less explode . " " What would happen is that over a period of several centuries after its birth , the star would shrink , its color would change to yellow or white , and it would get considerably smaller . It 's not a process that just goes boom . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are n't really sitting on top of a powder keg . " Bill 's uncle image smiled . He was wearing a yellow shirt , open at the neck , navy blue slacks , and slippers . " Not that kind of powder keg , any " They passed out of the data stream and the signal vanished . Hutch was bored . It had been six days since she 'd left Serenity , and she ached for human company . She rarely rode without passengers , did n't like it , and found herself reassuring Bill , who always knew when she was getting like this , that he should n't take it personally . " It 's not that you are n't an adequate companion , " she said . His image blinked off , to be replaced by the Wildside logo , an eagle soaring past a full moon . " I know . " He sounded hurt . " I understand . " It was an act , meant to help . But she sighed and looked out into the mist . She heard the gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was simply a concession to her privacy . This time it was something else . She tried reading for an hour , watched an old comedy ( listening to the recorded audience laughter and applause echo through the ship ) , made herself a drink , went back to the gym , worked out , showered , and returned to the bridge . She asked Bill to come back , and they played a couple of games of chess . " Do you know anyone at Renaissance ? " he asked . " Not that I 'm aware of . " A few of the names on the roster were vaguely familiar , probably passengers on other flights . They were astrophysicists , for the most part . A few mathematicians . A couple of data technicians . Some maintenance people . A chef . She wondered which was the young man with the luminous eyes . They live pretty well , she thought . A chef . A physician . A teacher . A -- She stopped . A teacher ? " Bill , what possible use would they have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hutch . It does seem strange . " A chill worked its way down her spine . " Get Renaissance on the circuit . " A minute later , the technician with the eyes reappeared . He turned the charm on again , but this time she was n't having any . " You have a Monte DiGrazio at the station . He 's listed as a teacher . Would you tell me what he teaches ? " He was gazing wistfully at her while he waited for her transmission to arrive . " What are you thinking ? " asked Bill . He was seated in a leather armchair in a book-lined study . In the background she could hear a fire crackling . She started to answer but let it trail off . The technician heard her question and looked puzzled . " He teaches math and science . Why do you care ? " Hutch grumbled at her stupidity . Ask the question right , dummy . " Do you have dependents on board ? How many people are there altogether ? " " I think you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded her arms and squeezed down as if to make herself a smaller target . The technician was looking at her with crinkled eyebrows . " Yes . We have twenty-three dependents . Fifty-six people in all . Monte has fifteen students . " " Thank you , " said Hutch . " Wildside out . " Bill 's innocuously content features hardSo if an evacuation does become necessary --  " " We 'd have to leave almost half of them behind . " Hutch shook her head . " That 's good planning . " " Hutch , what do we do ? " Damned if she knew . " Bill , get me a channel to Serenity . " THE ERUPTIONS COMING from Proteus were growing more intense . Hutch watched one that appeared to stretch millions of kilometers , boiling out beyond the edge of the star cloud before running out of steam . " All set to Serenity , " said Bill . She checked the operations roster and saw that Sara Smith would be on duty when the transmission arrived , in two and a half hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way up to management . Not easy to get along with , but Sara would understand the problem and take it seriously . It was Sara 's boss , Clay Barber , who 'd assigned Hutch to the mission and instructed her to take the suddenly inadequate Wildside . She composed herself . Blowing up would be unprofessional . The green lamp over the console imager blinked on . " Sara , " she said , gazing steadily into the lens but keeping her voice level , " I 'm supposed to be able to evacuate Renaissance if there 's a problem . But apparently somebody forgot they have dependents . Wildside does n't have space for everybody . Not close . " Please advise Clay . We need a bigger ship tout de suite . I do n't know whether this place is going to blow or not , but if it does , as things now stand , we are going to have to leave twenty or so people . " " That was good , Hutch , " said Bill . " I thought you struck exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt washed out , worried , tired , uncomfortable . Frightened . What was she supposed to say to Harper and Dimenna when she arrived at Renaissance ? Hope there 's no problem , folks . Whom did you want to save ? It did nothing for her somber mood when a warning lamp began to flash . A couple of the stations went down , several screens switched off . The lights went dim , the fans died , and for a few moments the bridge was very quiet . Then everything came back . " It 's under control , " said Bill . " Okay . " " Conditions like these , we can expect that occasionally . " Ship 's systems occasionally shut down to protect themselves from external power surges . " I know . " " And we have a response from Serenity . " " On-screen . " It was Barber . Overweight , balding , low irritability level , did n't like being disturbed when things went wrong . In a rare expansive mood he 'd once told her that he 'd become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't mattered and that she 'd walked out anyhow . Hutch understood why . He was in his office . " Hutch , " he said , " I 'm sorry about the problem . The Wildside was the biggest ship we had available . They 've been sitting out there for years . Surely they 'll be all right for a few more weeks . I understand the Lochran is ahead of schedule . We 've got a couple people here who 've spent time at Renaissance , and they tell me the place always looks scary to people going out there for the first time . It 's because you 're running through all those gases . Ca n't see very far . " What I 'd like you to do is just try to play things by ear when you get to Renaissance . Do n't mention that the Wildside is under capacity . They wo n't know if you do n't bring it up . I 'd send a second ship , but that seems a bit like overkill . Just tough it out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're uncomfortable with the present arrangement . Maybe I can hurry them along . " He ran a hand through his thinning hair and looked squarely out of the screen at her . " Meantime I need you to just get us through . Okay ? I know you can handle it . " Serenity Station 's ring of stars replaced the solemn features . " That 's it ? " she said . " That 's all he 's got to say ? " " His attitude might be different if he were here looking out the window . " " You goddam know it would be . " He paused and frowned , distracted by someMore incoming , " he said . " From Renaissance . " Hutch felt her stomach lurch . This time it was the station director himself . Lawrence Dimenna , A.F.D. , G.B.Y. , two-time winner of the Brantstatler Award . He was handsome in an austere and distant sort of way . Like many accomplished centenarians , he looked relatively young , yet his eyes radiated the inflexibility and certainty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . His hair was blond , his jaw set , and he was not happy . Nevertheless he managed a smile . " Captain Hutchins , I 'm glad you got here promptly . " He was seated at a desk . Several plaques were arranged on the bulkhead behind him , positioned to reveal they were there . She was n't close enough to make out details unless she increased magnification , an action that would have been perceived as less than polite . But one carried the United Kingdom coat of arms . Knight of the Realm , perhaps ? He gathered himself , studied the broad expanse of his desk , then brought his eyes up to look into hers . He looked frightened . " We 've had an eruption , " he said . He used the sort of monotone that suggests the speaker is keeping his head amid serious trouble . " Proteus has thrown off a major flare . " Her heart picked up . " I told them this could happen . There should have been a ship on-station and ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought he was saying ? " I 've given the order to evacuate . When you get here tomorrow , we 'll have a couple of technicians standing by to refuel you --  . " He paused . " I assume that 'll be necessary . " " Certainly advisable , " she said , speaking out of a haze . " If we have time . " " Okay , we 'll take care of it . I do n't suppose you can do anything to speed things up ? " " You mean get there more quickly ? No . We 're locked into our present flight plan . " " I understand . Well , it 's all right . We do n't expect the flare to arrive until about 0930 . " She let a few seconds pass . " Are we talking total loss of the station ? " The return transmission took several minutes . " Yes , " he said , stumbling a bit . He was having trouble maintaining his composure . " We see little possibility that Renaissance can survive . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station will have been blown " His head sank forward , and he seemed to be looking up at her . " Thank God you 're here , Captain . At least we 'll get our people out . If you arrive on schedule , we think we can have your ship fueled and be on our way three hours before it arrives . Should be plenty of time . " We 'll have everyone ready to go . If you need anything else , let the ops officer know , or myself , and we 'll see that you get it . " He got do n't know what we 'd have done if you had n't gotten here when you did . " The reply lamp flashed . He was finished . Did she have anything to say ? The engines were silent , and the only sound in the ship was the electronic burble of the instruments on the bridge and the steady hum of the air ducts . She wanted to tell him , to blurt out the truth , let him know there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't . She needed time to think . " Thank you , Professor , " she said . " I 'll see you in the morning . " Then he was gone and she was left staring desolately at the blank screen . " What are you going to do , Hutch ? " Bill asked . She had to struggle to keep the rage out of her voice . " I do n't know , " she said . " Possibly we should start by notifying Barber . Hutch , this is n't your fault . Nobody can blame you . " " Maybe you have n't noticed , Bill , but I 'm the front woman out here . I 'm the person who gets to tell Dimenna that the flare 's a bigger problem than he realizes . " God , when I get back I 'm going to throttle Barber . " We need help . Who else is in the neighborhood ? " " The Kobi is headed to Serenity for refitting . " The Kobi was a contact vessel , funded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to . In more than forty years , it had found nobody . But it did perform a service , training ship captains and other interested persons in how to behave if they actually happened to stumble across aliens . Hutch had been through the course : Make no threatening moves . Blink lights " in an inviting manner . " Record everything . Transmit alert to nearest station . Do n't give away strategic information , like the location of the home world . If fired on , depart hastily . The Kobi ' s skipper was Chappel Reese , finicky , nervous , easily startled . The last person in the world you 'd want out saying hello to the civilization down the road . But he was a fanatic on the subject , and he had relatives in high places . " What 's the Kobi ' s capacity ? " " It 's a yacht . Maximum is eight . Ten in an emergency . " Bill shook his head . " He 's got a full load on this flight . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Preacher Brawley 's ship . That brought a surge of hope . " Where is he ? " Brawley was already a near-legendary figure . He 'd saved a science mission that had miscalculated its orbit and was getting sucked down into a neutron star , he 'd brought back the disease -- ridden survivors of the Antares II effort without regard to his own safety , and he 'd rescued a crew member on Beta Pac by using a wrench to club one of that world 's voracious reptiles to death . Bill looked pleased . " Within range . If he 's on schedule , the Condor could be here tonight . If he makes a good jump , he could be in by early morning . " " He has room ? " " Only a handful of passengers . Plenty of space . But we should contact him without delay . There is no one else close enough to help . " Star travel was as much art as science . Ships did not return to sublight space with precision . One could materialize quite far from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase with the range of the jump . The risk normally lay in the possibility of materializing inside a target body . In this case , even materializing inside the cloud constituted a major hazard . Thin as it was , it nevertheless possessed enough density to explode an arriving ship . That meant Preach would have to follow her own procedure , make his jump well outside the envelope , then make a run for the station . On the way back out , he 'd be racing the flare until he got enough acceleration to jump back into hyperspace . He had reckless red hair and blue eyes that seemed lit from within . He was not extraordinarily handsome , in the classic sense , but there was an easygoing sails-to-the-wind attitude about the man and a willingness to laugh at himself that utterly charmed her . A year or so earlier , when they 'd found themselves together at Serenity , he 'd made her feel that she was the center of the world . Hutch was n't inclined to give herself to men on short acquaintance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Brawley . Somehow , though , the evening had gotten diverted , and she 'd thought better of casting a lure . Next time , she 'd decided . There had been no next time . Bill was still talking about the Condor . The ship was engaged in biological research . Brawley has been collecting samples on Goldwood , and was returning them to Bioscan 's central laboratory at Serenity . Goldwood was one of the worlds on which life had not progressed past the single-cell stage . " Let 's talk to them , " she said . Lamps blinked on . " Channel is open , Hutch . If the Condor is running on schedule , transmission time one way is one hour seventeen minutes . I will also relay through Serenity in the event he 's off-course . " Because if he was , the directed hypercomm signal would not find him . Despite the seriousness of her situation , Hutch felt flustered . Schoolgirl flustered . Dumb . Mentally she hitched up her socks , steadied her voice , and peered at the round black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 've got --  " The lights blinked again and went out . This time they did not come back . When Bill tried to talk to her his voice sounded like a recording at reduced power . The pictures dropped off the displays , and the fan shut down , stuttered , and started up again . Bill tried unsuccessfully to deliver an epithet . The emergency lights came on . " What was that ? " she asked . " What happened ? " He needed about a minute to gather his voice , made several false starts , and tried again . " It was an EMP , " he said . An electromagnetic pulse . " How much damage ? " " It fused everything on the hull . " Sensors . Transmitters and dishes . Hypercomm . Optics . " Are you sure ? Bill , we need to contact the Condor . Tell them what 's happening . " " It 's all down , Hutch . " She gazed out at the streaming mist . " Do n't even think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ? " " You 'll get cooked . " Radiation levels were , um , astronomical . Unless she went outside and replaced the transmitter , there was no hope of alerting Preach . " Too much wind out there at this velocity , even if you want to get yourself well- done , Hutch . Keep in mind , something happens to you , nobody gets rescued . " " You could manage it . " " At the moment , I 'm blind . I could n't even find the station . Renaissance will notify Serenity what 's happening and Barber can figure the rest out for himself . " " They 'll be down , too . The same EMP --  " " They 're equipped for this environment . They 've got heavy-duty suits . They can send somebody out without killing him . " " Yeah . " She was n't thinking clearly . Good . She did n't want to go anyway . " After we get to the station you can make all the repairs you want . If you still have a mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to round up Preach . " Bill 's fireplace went silent . " I know . " THEY WERE NAVIGATING on dead reckoning . Course and speed had been laid in hours ago , predicated on exact knowledge . All that was required was to avoid gliding past the station without seeing it . But visibility was getting worse , and would probably be down to a couple of klicks by morning , when they arrived . It should be enough , but God help them if they missed the target . " Bill , what happens if we put them all in the Wildside ? " " Everybody ? Fifty-six people ? Fiftyseven counting you . How many adults ? How many children ? How old are they ? " " Say forty adults . What happens ? " His image appeared to have grown older . " We 'd be okay for the first few hours . Then it 'd start to get a little close . We 'd be aware of a growing sense of stale air . After about thirteen hours , conditions would begin to deteriorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage ? " " I do n't have enough information . " " Guess . " " I do n't like to guess . Not on something like this . " " Do it anyway . " " At about fifteen hours . Once it begins , things will go downhill quickly . " His eyes found hers . " You can do it , pick up the extra people , if Dimenna was smart enough to let Serenity know what 's happening here , and if Serenity contacted the Condor , and if the Condor could find us soon enough to take the extra people off . " THE LIGHTS CAME back , along with full power . During the course of the evening she wandered restlessly through the ship , read , watched sims , and carried on a long , rambling conversation with Bill . The AI pointed out that she 'd eaten nothing since lunch . But she had no appetite . Later that evening , he appeared on the bridge in a VR mode , seated on her right hand . He was wearing an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breast pocket . Bill prided himself on the range and ingenuity implicit in the design of his uniforms . The patches always bore his name but otherwise changed with each appearance . This one carried a silhouette of the ship crossing a galactic swirl . " Are you going to try to take every " She 'd been putting off the decision . Wait till she got to Renaissance . Then explain it to Dimenna . Not enough air for everybody , Professor . Not my fault . I did n't know . She sat entertaining murderous thoughts about Barber . Bill suggested she take a trank , but she had to be sure she was fully functional in the morning . " I do n't know yet , Bill , " she said . The interior lights dimmed as it grew late . The observation panels also darkened , creating the illusion that night had arrived outside . Gradually the mist faded until she could see only an occasional reflection of the cabin lights outside . Usually she was quite comfortable in the Wildside , but tonight the vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ship , and she listened to air currents and the murmur of the electronics . She sat down in front of her display every few minutes and checked the Wildside 's position . Meantime , Preacher was getting farther away . She could send a hypercomm after him as soon as she reached Renaissance . But by then it would be far too late . She decided she would leave nobody . Put them all on board , and run for it . But the Wildside did n't have the raw power to climb directly out of the gravity well . She 'd have to arc into orbit and then lift out . That would put the flare virtually on top of her before she could make the jump . But it was okay . That was n't the problem . The air was the problem . Her only hope to save everyone was to rendezvous with the Condor . She could n't do it in deep space ; they 'd have nothing to key on , so they would n't be able to find each other . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nearby star , something within a few hours , inform Preach , go there , and hope for the best . The obvious candidate was an unnamed class-M , five light-years away . Approximately eight hours ' travel time . Add that to the couple of hours it would take her to get away from the flare , and she would have people succumbing to oxygen deprivation at about the time she arrived . Even assuming the Condor showed up promptly , it was unlikely Preach would be able to find her inside another three or four hours . It was possible . He could even jump out alongside her . But it was n't very likely . " It 's not your fault , " Bill said again . " Bill , " she snapped , " go away . " He retired and left her to the clicks , burps , and whispers of the empty ship . SHE STAYED ON the bridge past midnight . The engines rumbled into life at about one and began the long process of slowing the Wildside down for its rendezvous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program during which Dimenna and Mary Harper and someone else she did n't know , Marvin Child , argued for the life of Renaissance Station before an Academy committee . " Do you think , " demanded Harper , " we 'd ask our colleagues to go out there , that we 'd go out there ourselves , if we were n't sure it was safe ? " Child was thin , gray , tired . But he exhibited a fair degree of contempt for anyone who disagreed with him . Just listen to me , he suggested , and everything will be okay . Dimenna was n't much better . " Of course there 's a hazard , " he conceded at the conclusion of the hearing . " But we 're willing to accept the risk . " What had he said to her ? I told them this would happen . She listened to him and his partners assuring the world very emphatically that it would not . Hell , they 'd brought their dependents out here .

A little before five she climbed out of her chair , trudged back to her quarters , showered , brushed her teeth , and put on a fresh uniform . SHE CHECKED THE individual compartments to ensure they were ready . She 'd need additional bedding to protect her extra passengers . That would come from the station .

" We are where we are supposed to be , " said Bill , interrupting her struggle . " Twenty-seven minutes to rendezvous . " He was wearing a gray blazer and matching slacks . " It would have been prudent to shut the place down a couple of years ago . " " A lot of people have their careers tied into Renaissance , " she said . " No one yet understands all the details of star formation . It 's an important project . But they sent the wrong people out , they got unlucky , and it 's probably inevitable that they 'd stay until the roof fell in . " THE MIST WAS becoming brighter . Hutch was watching it flicker across a half dozen screens when Bill broke in . " I have a channel open to Renaissance . " Thank God . " Get Dimenna for me , Bill . " The comm screen flipped through a series of distorted images . " Welcome to Renaissance , " said a strange voice , before breaking up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . The picture cleared and went out a couple of times . When Bill finally locked it in , she was looking at Dimenna . " Good morning , Professor , " said Hutch . He looked at her somberly . " We were worried about you . I 'm glad to see that you survived . And that you 're " Hutch nodded . " We have a problem , " she said . " Are we on a private channel ? " The muscles in his jaw moved . " No . But it does n't matter . Say what you have to say . " " There was a communication breakdown somewhere . The Wildside has limited space . I was n't aware you had dependents . " " What ? For God 's sake , Woman , how could that happen ? " Maybe because nobody thought you 'd be dumb enough to bring dependents out But she let it go . " Ship 's designed to carry thirty-one passengers . We --  . " " What 's that ? " His face reddened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are we supposed to do with the rest of our people ? " He wiped the back of his hand against his mouth and looked to one side and then the other . He was listening to someone . Then : " Is another ship coming ? " " Maybe , " she said . " Maybe . " She looked at him . " Let me ask you a question . We got hit by an EMP . " " It was a spillover from the jet . Happens once in a while . It was n't an EMP . Not strictly speaking . " He relaxed a bit , as if speaking about something else helped divert him from the choices he would have to make . " It had the same effect . Fried everything on the hull . " " Yes . A stream of high-energy particles will do that . It knocked us out , too . What 's your question ? " " Did you get back up ? Have you been in contact with Serenity ? " " No . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside so we could talk to you . It 's all we have . " She swallowed and struggled to control her voice . " Then they do n't know the situation . " " They certainly know we 've gone dead . We were talking to them when it happened . " " Do they know you need to evacuate ? " " We were advising them of that fact . " It was like pulling teeth . " And did you make your point before you got blown off the circuit ? " He struggled to keep his temper . " Yes . ' Okay . They know he needs to get out . And they know the Wildside is too small . That should mean , has to mean , the Condor is on its way . " Anything else , Captain Hutchins ? " There was . " Send us everything you have on the flare . " It was still coming . It was big and it was hot and it was going to turn Renaissance into a memory . Its range had closed to 6.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometers per minute . She 'd need an hour running in orbit before she could gain enough momentum to lift away . She 'd be able to get clear , but she was going to get her feet toasted . She thanked him and signed off . Moments later , she saw a flash of silver in the mist . The station . RENAISSANCE STATION WAS composed of three ancient superluminals : the Belize , a former Academy survey vessel ; the Nakaguma , a ship that had once hauled supplies and people out to the terraformers at Quraqua ; and the storied Harbinger , which had discovered the Noks , the only known living extraterrestrial civilization . There 'd been a long fight to have the Harbinger declared a global monument . But the effort had failed , and the legendary ship would end its days out here in this inferno . Their drives had been removed , hulls heavily reinforced , cooling systems beefed up . Thick connecting tubes joined them , and a vast array of sensors , antennas , particle detectors , transducers , and assorted other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY was emblazoned across the Nakaguma 's hull . And the after section of the Harbinger bore the Academy seal , a scroll and lamp framing the blue Earth of the World Council . Ordinarily she would have turned the ship over to Bill , who liked to dock , or claimed he did . But with the sensors down , she switched to manual . They 'd hollowed out a substantial section of the Nakaguma , which was by far the largest of the three vessels , to create a service bay for incoming ships . She matched orbit and attitude and glided toward it . Several rows of utility lights blinked on to guide her , and a controller assisted . With systems down , it became fairly primitive . " A couple of degrees to port . " " Ease off a bit . " " That 's good . Keep coming . " " You 're doing quite well , " said Bill . AI 's were n't supposed to display sarcasm , but there it was . " Thank you , Bill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the interior of the Nakaguma , and eased into the dock . " Switch to maintenance , Bill , " she said . The AI acknowledged . Engines shut down , and power went to minimum . An access tube spiraled out of the dock and connected with her airlock . She checked to make sure her uniform looked good , opened the hatch , and strode through into Renaissance Station . Dimenna was waiting . He looked past her as if she did n't exist . " You do n't have much time , " he said . She needed to replace the burned-out gear on the hull . Her passengers were already arriving . Mostly women and children . They were carrying luggage . A few of the younger kids had toys , model starships , balls , dolls . Outside , two technicians in e-suits hurried along the docking skirt and inserted fuel lines . Hutch stood back to let her passengers board . Others , husbands , friends , fathers probably , a few other women , filed out into the observation gallery . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about six . Tears were streaming down her eyes . She implored Hutch to take care of the child and turned to Dimenna . " I wo n't leave him , " she said , referring to someone not present . " Put somebody else on in my place . " " Mandy , " said the director . " His name 's Jay , " Mandy told Hutch . She hugged the boy , the scene grew more tearful , and then she was gone , pushing back through those trying to get on board . " We decided not to crowd the ship , " said Dimenna . " Some of us are staying . " " That 's not the way --  " He held up a hand . It was decided . " Her husband is a department head . " In that moment Hutch conceived a hatred for Barber that was stronger than any emotion she had felt in her life . She wanted him dead . " I 'll get someone to replace her , " Dimenna said coldly . " How exactly do we handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that the way we do it ? Does that provide a reasonable number ? Or can you take a couple more without compromising safety ? " It was the most terrible moment of her life . " We do n't have to do it this way . We can load everybody up and --  " " This is the way we have chosen . " He was right , of course . If everyone boarded the Wildside , they became extra mass , slowed acceleration , used up air , put the others at risk , and eventually , barring a miracle , would have to go out through the airlock . If they stayed , they were at least in a place where a rescuing vessel would know to come . Small enough chance , but maybe the best one there was . " Hutch , " said Bill , " there are things you need to attend to if we 're to get going . " The world swam around her , and she looked from Dimenna to the people staggering through the airlock , to children asking why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered inside the gallery . " Hutch . " Bill was getting louder . " It 's essential that we complete repairs on the hull . There is very little time . " She scarcely heard him . Dimenna stood before her like a judge . And that was the moment Preacher Brawley chose to ride to the rescue . The signal from the Condor might have been picked up earlier had any of the technicians at the station been at their posts . But Bill caught it , recognized it immediately for what it was . " Hutch , " he told her , " I have good news . "
