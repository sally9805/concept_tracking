Errors and Omissions By Paul Goldstein Random House Paul Goldstein ONE The worst part of being drunk before breakfast is the hangover that returns before noon . Michael Seeley 's head throbbed . He was tall and ruddy , with an athlete 's vigor , but he felt compressed by the narrow room . Like the courtroom next door , the anteroom to Judge Randall Rappaport 's chambers was designed for intimidation , not comfort : high ceiling , dark wood , brass fittings , wood chairs with no padding . There were no magazines or newspapers for distraction , not even a legal newspaper or law journal . A leather-bound volume the size of a Bible was carefully centered on a mahogany side table : The Collected Opinions ( 1985-2005 ) of the Honorable Randall Rappaport , Justice of the Supreme Court of New York . The other person in the room , Noel Emmert , had n't acknowledged Seeley when he came in , and it was n't until after Seeley inspected the book and returned it to the table that Emmert spoke . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an edge to Emmert 's voice , as if he were delivering the punch line to a story . Emmert 's law practice was in county and state courts like this one , in a gray warren of pillared buildings off Foley Square at the bottom of Manhattan . Seeley practiced mainly in the federal courts on Pearl Street , around the corner . Seeley said , " How 's thereal property business ? " Emmert gestured , so-so . " Is this going to be a long waltz , counselor , or are we ready to settle ? " Seeley said , " Precisely . " Emmert 's eyebrows arched and he shot Seeley a look . " You know , " he said , " the law is truly humbling , if you think about it . Your guy sells a piece of crap sculpture to my guy , my guy decides to fix it up with a coat of paint , and before you know it , we have a lawsuit . Two professionals , me and you , spending our time and our clients ' money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Seeley said , " It 's funny , the way you do that . " " What 's that ? " " The way you do n't say , ' law . ' You say ' the law . ' There 's a nobility to it . " " I never thought about it . Maybe I picked it up in law school . " " That 's what I was thinking . " Given a choice , Seeley preferred the public theater of the courtroom where the playing field is level and a lawyer who does his homework has a better than average chance of winning . In judge 's chambers , where decisions are private and unreviewable , the averages were out of his control . The previous night , fueled by gin , Seeley had plotted his strategy for the morning meeting until he passed out on the bed in his room at the University Club . He came to five hours later , murderously hungover . He fumbled a small handful of ice cubes from the insulated bucket on the nightstand , pressed them against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staggering to the dingy bathroom , Seeley 's single thought was to dissolve the thick layers of gauze that encased his brain . He uncapped the fresh bottle of Bombay gin he had hidden beneath the sink and filled the tumbler to within a quarter-inch of the rim . He sipped tentatively at the bright , metallic liquid , took his time to study the University Club crest etched neatly into the glass , then , shuddering , gagging once , took the rest of the contents down in a succession of short , greedy gulps . He reached through the plastic curtain behind him and turned on the shower full force . Filling the tumbler a second time , he nursed the drink while he waited for the steam to rise . When he climbed through the curtain into the punishing needles , his mind was already clearing . Now , in Rappaport 's anteroom , the two tumblers of gin were dying inside him , and a burrowing thirst had taken over . He needed a drink . His hands clenched his knees . When he looked down he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dark gray , but one was glen plaid , the other herringbone . Although the light in the room at the University Club was poor , this had n't happened before . Rappaport 's secretary came in and announced that the judge was ready to see them . Busy signing papers , Rappaport took a full minute before indicating the two empty chairs that faced him , still not looking up from his desk . It was September and the weather was warm , but the judge had on a three-piece suit with a gold chain looped through the vest and black judicial robes open over that . A few strands of gray hair had been carefully combed and plastered across a white scalp . He could have been a child in the tall chair . Seeley would bet that when Rappaport told people he was a supreme court justice he did n't bother to add that there were almost four hundred other supreme court justices in the state . Because of a historical quirk in the way courts were designated in New York State 's judicial hierarchy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judicial system , not the highest . Rappaport read from the paper in front of him . " Minietello v. Weber Properties . " When he finally looked up , his expression was a scowl . " Where are your clients , counselors ? Where 's Mr. Minietello ? Where 's Mr. Weber ? " The voice was nasal , aggrieved . " Surely , when he scheduled this meeting , my clerk reminded you of the standing order . Your clients must be present any time there is a settlement conference before a justice of the supreme court . Mr. Emmert , you have practiced here long enough to know that . " " It 's a new requirement , Your Honor- " " But a mandatory one . " " I have consulted with my client on the point , Your Honor , and he has agreed to waive a personal appearance . " " This is not a requirement that can be waived , counselor . " The two could have been volleying at tennis . " I want your clients here . I see too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details , the client would gladly accept . And you , Mr. . . . " Rappaport 's tiny fingers , a busy rodent 's , sorted through a pile of papers , searching for an appearance sheet or an appointment diary . This was playacting , Seeley knew , the way a small man bullies a newcomer to his domain . The judge knew his name ; it was on the same sheet as the names of the parties . Finally , Rappaport found the paper he pretended to be looking for . " Mr. Seeley . What about your client ? Is he waiving , too ? " " He was detained , Your Honor , but he 's on his way . " Seeley had made a detour from his room at the University Club to his office on Sixth Avenue in midtown to collect a briefcase , and there had fallen into a long conversation with one of the mailboys about the Mets losing a double-header the day before . Leaving the building in a hired car , he forgot his promise to pick up Gary Minietello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the settlement conference . Only when he was walking up the granite courthouse steps , already late for the meeting with Rappaport , did Seeley remember the promise . He made a rushed call for Minietello to meet him in chambers . " So , we shall sit here and wait for Mr. Seeley 's client . " Seeley had dealt with difficult judges before , but he had the feeling that Rappaport was going to be a special challenge . The judge swiveled in his chair to Emmert . " You 're Fordham , are n't you ? " " Two years behind Your Honor . Your name still echoed in the hallways . All the time I was there , the professors were still talking about when you destroyed the Columbia team in the moot court competition . " Rappaport beamed . " Harvard , too . In the finals . The Jesuits field a fine moot court team . Where did you attend school , Mr. Seeley ? " " Canisius . " " The Jesuit school upstate ? " Seeley nodded . " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . I went to college there . " " I was asking where you went to law school , " Rappaport said . Seeley knew that 's what he had meant . " Harvard . " " I thought so . An Ivy Leaguer . " The judge paused to think if he could make something more of that , and instead made a show of studying his wristwatch and adjusting the cuff of his shirt . " I have a heavy schedule today , counselors , and unlike you , I 'm not paid by the hour . So why do n't we get started . You can fill your client in when he arrives , Mr. Seeley . Mr. Emmert , I want you to brief your client , too . " Again he searched through the papers on his desk . " Let me see if I can help you frame the issue here . " Every first-year law student knows that how a legal issue is posed inevitably determines how it is decided . Seeley said , " If Your Honor would allow me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found the briefing memo . " Correct me if I am in error , counselors , but , as I understand it , what this little tempest is about is that your client , Mr. Seeley , sold one of his sculptures to Mr. Emmert 's client , and now he wants to stop him from putting a coat of paint on it . " Minietello 's sculpture consisted of a dozen or so rusted structural girders exploding through a brick wall in the lobby of a Park Avenue office building , the girders ' extremities twisted and shredded as if from a violent explosion . The building , owned by Emmert 's client , had been on the market for more than a year . A buyer had at last made an offer on the property , but insisted that the sculpture be cleaned up and painted . Minietello objected . None of his works had ever been painted ; to do so , he told anyone who would listen , would violate the integrity of his vision . Seeley did n't care much for the sculpture , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoining any alteration of the work . His next step , unless the Honorable Randall Rappaport forced a settlement on him , would be to go to trial and win a judgment making the injunction permanent . Seeley had been waiting years for a case like this-the opportunity to establish a foothold in New York law for the principle that artists have moral as well as economic rights ; that no one , not even the owner of a work of art , can alter the work without the artist 's consent . " If Your Honor will- " " So we have a straightforward clash of interests here , " Rappaport said . His chair squeaked as it rocked in a steady rhythm . " Your client 's aesthetic wishes on the one side , Mr. Seeley , and on the other side , the interest of Mr. Emmert 's client in selling his property . What 's not clear to me , Mr. Seeley , is how your client has been injured . " The judge might be a sanctimonious jerk , Seeley thought , but he was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving no rough edge on which Seeley could build an argument . Seeley could argue that Minietello 's interests were not only aesthetic but that his reputation , and consequently his future income , would suffer as soon as word got out that one of his works had been altered . But that was n't the principle for which he had filed the case . Emmert nodded at Rappaport 's words but did n't speak . When a judge is making your case for you , you do n't interrupt . " I would be interested in hearing what precedents you think you may have on your side . " Rappaport was still looking at Seeley . If the judge had read his brief , he knew there were no direct precedents to support his position . But neither had there been direct precedent for any of the great decisions that had challenged , and ultimately reversed , the authority of existing law . For Seeley , that was the great beauty of American law : if you were persistent , prepared thoroughly , and had justice on your side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , federal law already- " " This is not federal court , counselor . This is New York Supreme Court . " Seeley 's thick hair felt matted as he tried to massage away the throbbing at the back of his head . He was parched ; just speaking felt like fingernails clawing at his throat . The meeting was not going as he had planned it the night before . His thoughts ricocheted from the judge to Noel Emmert-the lawyer had the flushed look of a man who liked a drink-to the bottles he had stashed in the credenza in his office uptown . What if the chrome carafe on Rappaport 's side table were filled with iced gin ? How else would a judge get through the tedium of the day ? " Every civilized country in the world , " Seeley heard himself saying , " England , France , Germany-every one of these countries recognizes an artist 's moral right . No court in any of these countries would hesitate to enjoin Mr. Emmert 's client from disfiguring a work of art . " " Even assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still rocking , " this is not a federal court and this is not a French court , either . " He tilted back in the chair and clasped his hands over his vest . Seeley 's thoughts turned to the number of ways he might strangle Rappaport . " It 's a fundamental principle of decency that you ca n't take away an artist 's right to the integrity of his work . " Emmert said , " What about my client ? Maybe he 's an artist , too . Maybe he thinks this piece of junk looks better painted . " " That 's a foolish argument , and you know it . " Seeley had n't intended it , but his voice had risen . " Painting someone else 's sculpture is n't art . " Rappaport smiled . " You must forgive Mr. Emmert . He lacks the advantage of a Harvard education . " Seeley tried to think of a smart remark that might turn this bond between Rappaport and Emmert in his favor , but realized he was lost . Still , the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptors . It will set a precedent for painters . Writers . Musicians . " Why was he having such difficulty controlling his voice ? This was closing argument , a high schooler 's imitation of Clarence Darrow . " It makes no difference if the work is Picasso 's Guernica or the image some prehistoric man painted on the wall of his cave . " His voice rose perilously . " A work of art-any work of art-touches something sacred in us . To violate it- " Words that had seemed so eloquent the previous night now tasted like paper in Seeley 's mouth ; he gagged on them and hated himself for believing them . " I do n't know what they put up with in federal court , but I will not have voices raised in my chambers . Do you understand that , counselor ? " Rappaport 's voice was level , his chair still . He waited for Seeley 's acknowledgment before continuing . He leaned over the desk , his hands spread before him . " Look , let 's be practical about this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is this one . On your client 's side , Mr. Seeley , there are some injured sensitivities . That is understandable . Continues ...
