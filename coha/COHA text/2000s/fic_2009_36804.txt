Private Jet Charter <p> Somewhere over Indiana <p> When I was a kid I fantasized about being a kick-butt crime fighter . You know , like Emma Peel of The Avengers or Agent 99 of Get Smart . Later , like most teenaged girls growing up in the seventies , I wanted to be one of Charlie 's Angels . Specifically , Jill Munroe , but only because I wanted Farrah 's hair . <p> Several decades and a career in the performance arts later , I 'm still pining for the perfect hairstyle . The kick-butt crime-fighter fantasy , however , recently became reality . No one ( except maybe my ex-husband ) was more surprised than me . In this episode of my life gone wild , I 'm winging through the friendly skies , escaping the scene of an anticrime . <p> My name is Evie Parish and I 'm the newest member of Chameleon  --  a specialized branch of the AIA  --  which is something like the CIA only smaller and sneakier . Comprised of ex-grifters , former bunko cops , and now me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to sing , dance , and act on the stages of the Atlantic City casinos . Now the world is my stage and my idea of applause is the sound of a cell door slamming shut on the amoral keister of a scam artist . No , I do n't have a background in law enforcement ( or a criminal record ) , but my acting and sleight-of-hand skills ( compliments of a stint as a magician 's assistant ) along with my scary-good memory make me perfect for this job . <p> Unfortunately , not everyone on the team agrees . Especially the man I 'm sitting next to , the object of a fantasy fling come true , Arch " Ace " Duvall , a hunky bad boy with a Scottish accent and a soft spot for good-girl me . Call me crazy in love . Although Arch has yet to say the words , he did carve the sentiment in a tree : Arch loves Evie . <p> Yeah . I know . How sweet is that ? And totally unexpected given his personal code . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship . Ever . Not that we 've committed to anything other than " trying to make this thing work . " <p> Where was I ? <p> Ah , yes . My new reality . An adrenaline-charged cross between Ocean 's Eleven and The Thomas Crown Affair sprinkled with the misadventures of a modern-day Doris Day . I kid you not . <p> A reformed con artist , Arch is one of two alpha dogs at Chameleon . The other being Special Agent Milo Beckett  --  known to the team as " Jazzman . " Beckett  --  also sexy , but in a quiet , straight-arrow way  --  hired me without consulting Arch . He also kissed me  --  without consulting Arch  --  which resulted in fireworks , only not the good kind . I 'm one of those people who ca n't jaywalk without getting busted , so naturally Arch walked in on the spontaneous lip-lock . I was mortified . Arch was pissed . And Beckett was no help whatsoever . But that 's neither here nor there . Well , it 's somewhere , just not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough worries , thank you very much . <p> I tried to put them out of my mind . Closed my eyes and willed the drone of the jet engine to lull me to sleep . It was nearly midnight . Hopped up on adrenaline all day and night , my body was exhausted , but my brain kept spinning scenarios worthy of a David Mamet film . Anxious , I fussed with my seat buckle and prayed for a smooth ride . My stomach was already churning . " Leaving a team member behind feels wrong , " I blurted . <p> " Dinnae borrow trouble , Sunshine . " <p> " It 's just that  --  " <p> " Jazzman 's more than qualified to manipulate a smalltime chiseler like Frank Turner . Dinnae let his moniker snow you , yeah ? " <p> Moniker . Grifter-speak for nickname . Turner 's was " Mad Dog . " <p> Yikes . <p> " Okay , but " I have a bad feeling . Normally , Arch and Beckett manipulated bad sorts in tandem . I could n't help feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck close to his partner . Maybe not as an active participant , but at least for backup . Though not intentionally , I 'd driven a wedge between the two men . All because of that stupid kiss . Oh , and the time I confided in Beckett instead of Arch . <p> Oops . <p> I suppose most women would die to have two sexy men , two crime fighters , no less , vying for their attention . As fantasies go , it 's a humdinger . In reality it'sunsettling . Even though they both denied it , I was certain , at heart , Arch and Beckett were friends . What if Beckett 's plan curdled ? What if he got hurtor worse ? How would Arch live with that ? How would I live with that ? <p> " Dinnae let that imagination of yours run wild , " Arch said . He grasped my hand to still my nervous scratching . <p> My tell . <p> Crap . <p> " Let it go and trust Jazzman 's judgment . He ordered us to fly oot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped they did n't have anything to do with me . " You 're right , " I said , faking an optimistic smile . " I 'm just stunned that our part of the sting went so smoothly . " <p> " I 'm not . " The green-eyed rebel flashed a cocky smile while stroking my cheek . <p> Zing . Zap . <p> My insides fluttered with something other than anxiety . Call me smitten . Along with countless other women . <p> I 've heard the sighs . Witnessed the moony-eyed gawking . Heck , I 've sighed and gawked myself . Arch is drop-dead gorgeous and deadly charming to boot . Talk about a dangerous combo . He 's also six years younger than my forty-one . Not that that 's an issue . Okay . That 's a lie . I 'm a little self-conscious in my older woman shoes . Arch  --  bless his warped soul  --  insists age is n't an issue . Then again , he excels at telling people what they want to hear . <p> " Jazzman 's more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Uh . Right . <p> My bad feeling escalated into imminent disaster . My pulse escalated , too . It did n't help that one of my two best friends , Jayne , had called me this morning in a tizzy over her psychic 's warning after consulting a crystal ball . " Mixing business with pleasure today is dangerous . Your friend must turn off the heat or someone will get burned . " Nic , my other best bud would snort , citing crystal balls as mystical bullshit . I prefer the term hooey , and normally I 'd agree , but lately I confess I 'm paranoid when it comes to this new life that seems too good to be true . <p> Do n't scratch . <p> Arch asked the lone flight attendant for a bottle of champagne . Lydia , a twentysomething redhead with a knockout body and celebrity-perfect teeth , rushed to comply . Instead of watching her fawn over her sole passenger  --  me being invisible in her Scot-struck eyes  --  I excused myself to use the private jet 's lavatory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . <p> " Absolutely . " Liar . <p> I moved down the narrow aisle before my heated cheeks gave me away . I did n't want to admit that I was feeling insecure in our new relationship . I did n't want to vocalize my lingering worries about Milo Beckett , prompting Arch to misinterpret my concern for his partner , my boss . I did n't want him to know I was freaking out about the recent web of lies we 'd spun in order to avenge a U.S. Senator . I did n't want him to doubt my nerve . He already questioned my virtuous nature . <p> Where was I ? <p> Ah , yes . Lies . <p> A product of my uptight Midwestern upbringing , I 'm uncomfortable with purposeful deceit . A detriment in my new line of work . A liability Arch keeps pointing out . Although he believes I possess the motivation and talent , he 's convinced I 'm hindered by my goody-two-shoes morals . <p> I 'm determined to prove otherwise . <p> Hence locking myself in the private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not as if I could discuss my concerns with Arch : a ) it would only support his theory that I 'm not cut out for his line of work ; b ) born into a family of grifters , Arch 's concept of right and wrong is blurred . <p> For the last several days I 've been ignoring or suppressing serious issues that are destined to explode in my face . This moment I was obsessing on the smoke and mirrors mission that had involved blowing a lot of smoke up a lot of butts , some belonging to my own family and friends . Even though I 'd played loose with the truth for the greater good , I could n't shake the feeling that it would end badly . <p> " There are all kinds of lies , " I could hear Arch say . <p> I gripped the rim of the stainless-steel sink , stared into the mirror and , instead of bemoaning my darkening roots ( hey , I never professed to being a natural blonde ) , I concentrated on obliterating my guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the research book I 'm reading on scams and frauds . Turns out most of us lie daily albeit unconsciously . White lies . Etiquette lies . Lies of omission . Falsehoods intended to spare someone 's feelings or to perpetuate goodwill . Like the friend who assures you your botched perm does n't make you look like a deranged poodle . Or the parent who nurtures a child 's belief in Santa Claus . <p> Then there are lies with selfish yet relative harmless intent . Politicians lie to win elections . Publicists lie to catapult an unknown artist to stardom . A form of manipulation we typically take for granted . Of course they 're going to spin the truth , that 's what they do . <p> But no one spins the truth like a con artist . Masters of persuasion and deception , con artists  --  aka confidence men , grifters , flimflammers , bunko artists , hustlers  --  excel in telling you what you want to hear . They target character traits ranging from arrogant to insecure , needy to greedy , ambitious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class is immune and the mark 's intelligence is rarely a factor . <p> I should know . Last month I fell for a street hustle and I 'm a smart cookie . Just gullible and naive , according to Arch . Then two weeks ago my mom , a mega-smart , supergrounded realist , fell prey to a Sweetheart Scam . Not that she knows , thanks to Chameleon . Point is , a good scam artist homes in on your needs and weaknesses and  --  bam  --  a sucker is born . <p> Where was I ? <p> Ah , yes . Avenging and protecting U.S. Senator Clark . Once we 'd determined how Frank " Mad Dog " Turner had cheated the senator 's wife at cards , cheating the cheat had been cake . Mad Dog never knew what bit him and before he had a chance to wise up , the entire team , with the exception of Beckett  --  got the hell out of Dodge . Or in this case , Hammond , Indiana . <p> Tabasco , Gina , and Woody were en route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Arch and I , still masquerading as the Baron of Broxley and his fiancTe , enjoyed the luxury of a private jet . Roomy accommodations , plush leather seats , expensive champagne , and an uber-sexy traveling companion . Who could ask for more ? <p> Too bad I was battling a panic attack . <p> Someone knocked on the door . " Miss Parish , is everything all right ? " <p> Lydia . <p> " I 'm fine . " Liar . My cheeks burned and my heart raced . Since I was alone , I scratched . <p> " In that case , would you please return to your seat ? The pilot warned we 're approaching heavy turbulence . " <p> I slapped a palm to my clammy forehead . So now in addition to battling an anxiety attack , I had to endure motion sickness ? I blinked at the door , felt a twinge in my jaw , and realized I was clenching my teeth . Oh , no . Though I had n't had an episode in weeks , I still suffered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked ? It had happened before . Talk about embarrassing . Almost as mortifying as puking into an airsick bag . <p> Instead of exiting the lavatory , I sank down on the toilet . " Be out in a minute , " I squeaked then dropped my head between my knees . Breathe . <p> Thirty seconds later , another knock . " Open the door , love . " <p> Arch . <p> " Ca n't . " <p> " Can nae or willnae ? " <p> Both . My voice stuck in my throat as my imagination took flight . <p> What if Mad Dog goes rabid and attacks Beckett ? Just because he 's a two-bit cheat that does n't mean he wo n't freak out and fight back when a Fed tries to run him out of town . <p> What if my family refuses to forgive me for convincing them I 'm " engaged " to a wealthy baron , even though I deceived them for the greater good ? <p> What if Arch fails to win my trust as he promised ? <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer man  --  Beckett ? <p> A millisecond later , the handle clicked and the metal door swung open . Another of Arch 's talents : picking locks . <p> Hunched over , I glanced up . I wanted to blast him for invading my privacy , instead I wheezed . <p> " Bloody hell , Sunshine . " He shut the door and stooped in front of me . <p> Hot-faced and short of breath , I stated the obvious . " Anxiety attack . " <p> " I can see that . " <p> He 'd seen it before . During our first mission when he 'd dashed my assumption that he was a Bond-like super spy by confessing his true profession . " I 'm a con artist , Evie . " Yeah , boy , that was a shock . He left out the part about him working for the good guys . I learned that important tidbit later from Beckett . <p> He stroked a hand down my back . " Talk it oot . " <p> I shook my head , palmed my jaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , " I said through clenched teeth . <p> He nudged aside my hand and massaged both sides of my face . " You 're internalizing . Let it oot and the symptoms will subside . " <p> Spoken like my dentist . Still , I refrained from speaking my mind . Instead , I yearned for my journal . Knowing I keep my feelings bottled , my dad had gifted me with my first diary when I was a kid . " For when your heart and mind are jammed . " <p> Like now . <p> Only my journal was in my tote bag and Arch was relentless . " You 're worried aboot Beckett . " <p> " I 'm worried about a lot of things . " So much for the private meltdown . <p> Someone , Lydia , knocked again . " Excuse me , but " <p> " Hold those thoughts . " Arch kissed my forehead then rose and cracked the door to speak with the persistent flight attendant . <p> I massaged the ache in my chest with one hand , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding . I 'm an expert at internalizing . At least I used to be . Since my infamous " snap " at a not-so-long-ago audition , I 'd been acting out and speaking out in ways I 'd only dreamed of . <p> " What did you say to her ? " I wheezed when Arch turned back to me . <p> " Something to make her go away . " <p> He grinned and my breath stalled . Not because of the anxiety attack , but because he was so freaking gorgeous . When describing him to Nic and Jayne , I 'd compared him to Gerard Butler , the Scottish actor who 'd rocked our socks in a couple of action films and melted our bones as a romantic lead . We always compared people to celebrities . We 're entertainers . Go with what you know . <p> Lately though , when I looked at Arch I only saw Archibald Robert Duvall . ( Yes , that 's his real name . ) Aka " Ace " ( his moniker ) , aka the Baron of Broxley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless legit . ) Hunky body , dark , cropped hair , hypnotic gray-green eyes , and a knee-buckling smile . Did I mention the Celtic tattoo banded around his sculpted biceps ? Yowza . And his warriorlike goatee ? Swoon . Not for the first time I wondered what this charismatic rebel saw in Ivory-soap me . Not for the first time , I questioned our longevity . <p> And immediately dropped my head back between my knees . <p> Wuss ! <p> Arch gently pulled me to my feet and into his arms . " Tell me your biggest worry . " <br> Continues ...
