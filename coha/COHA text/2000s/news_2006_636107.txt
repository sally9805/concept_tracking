<p> On April 11 , 1983 , while watching the Academy Awards  --  " Gandhi " was the big winner that year , beating out " E.T . "  --  we opened a 1979 Zaca Mesa Cabernet Sauvignon from Santa Ynez Valley that we 'd bought two months earlier for $6.99 . " Delicious , " we wrote in our notes . " Huge , rich , fruity . Powerful , yet with finesse . " <p> We went back and looked at those notes a couple of weeks ago because we wanted to convince ourselves that we were n't crazy . Reasonably priced American Cabernet Sauvignon really was good once , was n't it ? <p> Obviously , if we have to go back to an Oscar broadcast co-hosted by Liza Minnelli , Dudley Moore , Richard Pryor and Walter Matthau to remember tasty , affordable Cabernet , this is not a good sign . But our experience with Cabernet under $20 has been troubled for a long time . After large blind tastings over the past several years , we have suggested skipping the inexpensive American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creamy , overly alcoholic and , generally , like wines made with no passion and little regard for the consumer . There are some good ones , of course , but we have found there are better bets elsewhere in the wine store . <p> It 's always painful to write that . After all , not only is Cabernet Sauvignon the grape of the world 's greatest red wines , but it has a long and proud tradition in the United States . Even under $20  --  and , after all , $20 might not be what it used to be , but it 's still $20  --  we expect Cabernet Sauvignon to offer some layers of complexity , some structure , some interest and certainly some tasty fruit . <p> The last time we conducted a broad tasting of inexpensive American Cabernet was more than two years ago , so we thought we 'd try again . We focused on the vintage that you are most likely to see on store shelves today , 2003 , which was generally perceived as a good year . We bought more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a few were less widely available . As always , we were simply trying to get a sense of the state of the Cabernet art at the moment . We tasted the wines in blind flights over several nights . <p> With the newspaper so filled with bad news these days , we wish we could offer a respite . But we ca n't . This was , once again , a deeply disappointing tasting . The wines were sweet , simple and just not very pleasant . More than half of them rated just OK or worse , a terrible outcome . Many simply did n't taste ripe , " like the winemakers do n't trust the grape or the consumer , " as Dottie put it at one point . Even among those we found passable , too many tasted like simple Merlot , with broad , grapey tastes instead of the more-focused , more complex tastes we expect from Cabernet Sauvignon . <p> It need n't be like this . In tasting after tasting of inexpensive Cabernet , one of our favorites has been Gallo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's possible even in large quantities ( 60,000 cases of this one ) . And it 's possible for smaller producers , too : Another of our favorites this year was Barnard Griffin from Washington state ; 5,269 cases of this were made , and distributed nationwide . <p> Our best of tasting : Chateau Ste. Michelle from Washington , which was classy and reminded us what good Cabernet can taste like . In our notes on this wine , we even used the word " interesting , " which is certainly something we 'd expect in a good Cabernet . Over the years , we have consistently liked Ste. Michelle 's Merlot as well . <p> So , for now , we would continue to skip the American Cabernet aisle when we 're shopping for wines under $20 . But we assure you we will keep tasting them and report back in another couple of years . <p> u u u <p> UNUSUAL STUFF : A while back , we wrote about the charming tradition of May Wine , which is usually made from an inexpensive young Riesling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the time , we said that woodruff can be hard to grow , since we had killed most of ours . That brought a great deal of response from readers who said , basically : You must be joking . Well , our correspondents were certainly correct . In the two years since then , our woodruff not only has sprung back to life , but has taken over a good portion of our outdoor planter . It is even growing nicely under a deck . The woodruff flowered recently , so we made some May Wine as a celebration of the season . It was the first time we 've made it from scratch , with our own fresh woodruff instead of purchased dried sprigs . <p> There are many recipes for May Wine , but here 's what we did : We poured a bottle of Riesling into a bowl . Then we added six sprigs of sweet woodruff that we had dried in the oven for 15 minutes on low heat ( about 200 degrees ) , plus two tablespoons of sugar . We covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our bottle happened to be a liter , because that 's what we had in the house , so you might want to adjust the recipe if you are making less . ) The next day , we strained out the woodruff and poured the May Wine into glasses with very fragrant , ripe strawberries . It was delicious . It even smelled delicious . All of the tastes  --  the wine , the sugar , the woodruff ( which lent hints of vanilla and cinnamon ) and even the strawberries  --  seemed to knit together beautifully into a light , fresh and utterly delightful celebration of warm weather . Serious wine ? Of course not . Serious fun ? You bet . <p> THE DOW JONES INEXPENSIVE CABERNET SAUVIGNON INDEX <p> In a blind tasting of American Cabernet Sauvignon under $20 from the 2003 vintage , these were our favorites . In general , inexpensive Cabernet Sauvignon is made to be drunk right away , but if you find a bottle you like , tuck one away for a year or so and see how it develops . <p> VINEYARD/VINTAGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley ) <p> PRICE : $17.59 <p> RATING : Very Good <p> TASTERS ' COMMENTS : Best of tasting .
