<p> If his father needs him , Shawn Springs says he will walk away from the money , the celebrity and the glamorous lifestyle of a professional athlete . The Washington Redskins cornerback , upon learning several years ago that his father needed a kidney transplant , offered one of his own , knowing he would not be allowed to play pro football with just one kidney . <p> But his father , Ron , the former Dallas Cowboys fullback who suffers from complications related to diabetes  --  he had a foot amputated this year  --  declined the offer and would not let his son even be tested to see if he is a transplant match . <p> " I think that was a tremendous gesture , and it just justifies the fact that he 's a loving son , " Ron Springs said by telephone from his Dallas home this past week . " But I could n't have let him do that , because I always prayed and wanted him to be a professional athlete , so I would not have shortened his career by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet today in a critical NFC East game , Ron Springs , 49 , will be home in Dallas unable to make the trip for fear that it will worsen his condition . He knows he needs a transplant soon and has been buoyed by the recent news that one of his nieces is possibly a match . <p> " I was really going to try to make the game , " he said , " but I had to get some extra therapy and the prosthesis I have has been giving me trouble , so I 'm trying to get that fixed . So it would have been too much trouble to travel through the airport and walking around . I do n't want to risk anything , and I would n't want to do something to set back my transplant . I 'm just going to lay back , relax , have a good holiday and do n't do anything stupid to eliminate my chances of getting a transplant immediately . " <p> For Shawn Springs , who has spent years trying to track down family members and researching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more timely . He also realizes , however , that there still are hurdles to overcome before his father can regain his health . So the Pro Bowl defensive back still has not ruled out becoming a donor at some point . <p> " Hopefully , everything is going to work out ; we 're just waiting on it , " Shawn Springs said . " The thing is , when you 're waiting on a kidney transplant and you 're a diabetic he 's never really healthy enough to receive the kidney . And sometimes he might be ready to , and then he gets sick or has an ulcer or something . That 's the tough deal , getting it so it wo n't reject . <p> " So , yeah , if it came down to do it , if that was the last resort , I 'd do it . I know he told me no , but I 'd be a donor . Obviously , my NFL career would be over , but that 's something I would have to do . It 's a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I 'm done playing football or something . Be a reporter or whatever . I 'd just do something else . " <p> While Shawn Springs , 30 , who grew up in Silver Spring , spent the week receiving treatment for back and knee injuries at Redskins Park , doing what he can to be available for the Redskins ' biggest game in quite awhile at FedEx Field , his father was undergoing his grueling weekly regimen . Ron Springs receives dialysis every Monday , Wednesday and Friday and spent three months in a hospital earlier this year because of a staph infection . Even relatively minor ailments can become major for him . <p> Still , the decision to miss the critical game was not easy . Father and son realize the stakes in this rivalry from their unique place in it . <p> Ron Springs , who attends as many of Shawn 's home and road games as possible , grew up in Redskins country in Williamsburg , then became a well-recognized Cowboy and now lives near Texas Stadium . Shawn looked up to his father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Redskins during their glory days as well . <p> Ron Springs , a gregarious and outspoken locker-room leader during his NFL career , spent six seasons with the Cowboys and two with Tampa Bay before retiring . He was a key component in some of Hall of Fame tailback Tony Dorsett 's best seasons , and a fixture on the playoff teams from 1981 to 1983 ( he led Dallas in touchdowns in 1981 ) . The Redskins were on the rise then , winning their first Super Bowl in the 1982 season under Coach Joe Gibbs , and Dallas-Washington games were a national event . The importance of today 's game  --  with both teams battling for a playoff spot after several lean years  --  made it even more tempting to come to Washington . <p> " It 's a very tough game for me , " Ron Springs said . " It 's very important to both sides ; whoever loses will probably be out of the playoff picture and whatnot , and all I can do as a person is sit here and hope for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chips fall where they may , because I love both teams and I try to not get too emotional about it . But I probably will . " <p> Without Ron Springs 's influence , Shawn might never have switched from running back to cornerback , and he might not be a Redskin , either . Ron developed an affinity for Gibbs over the years , and urged his son to sign with Washington when he hit the free agent market in March 2004 . " I 'm very proud of Shawn , and very proud of the fact that he went to the Redskins , because I always thought that Coach Gibbs is a good Christian man , and I knew Coach Gibbs would work him hard and make sure he got the most out of him , " Ron said . <p> Gibbs helped sway Shawn as well , and Ron accompanied his son on his initial visit here . They dined at Morton 's and reminisced about being on opposite sidelines . <p> " We had a great time going back and forth about the old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who also has diabetes . " Shawn 's dad is really competitive , and you can tell where Shawn gets that . The sad thing is his dad has some real health issues , and we 're trying to support Shawn with that , but you can see lots of times those bloodlines are pretty good and you can kind of see where Shawn gets it from . His dad will joke with you and kid with you and he 's always on your butt . " <p> The Redskins signed Springs to a six-year , $30 million deal , including a $10 million signing bonus . Much of the deal is not guaranteed , and Springs also would likely have to repay a portion of his signing bonus if he donated a kidney and retired , but he says none of that would deter him from leaving football if necessary . " Would n't you do the same thing for your father ? " he asked . <p> While kidney transplants have become fairly common , Cathy Paykin , a social worker with the National Kidney Foundation , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major surgery , both mentally and physically . In some jurisdictions , police and fire departments do not accept employees with one kidney because of health concerns , and someone who donates a kidney must take every precaution to protect his or her remaining organ . <p> " If you only have one kidney you really have to watch out for it , particularly in an accident , " Paykin said . " Some people who are living donors have chronic pain for life that never went away . Some people have gone into a deep depression and had some very disturbing experiences with pain or disfigurement . It 's a minority , but it happens . " <p> Former Georgetown basketball star Alonzo Mourning resumed his NBA career after getting a kidney donation , but would not have been able to play with only one kidney . People with one kidney are not prevented from playing all recreational sports , Paykin said , but must refrain from absorbing severe contact to that area , ruling out football . <p> Shawn has two sisters , Ayra , a junior at Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dallas area , but Ron Springs says he wo n't let them be tested because they are too young . Shawn and Ron attended Ohio State as well , both leaving a lasting impression . Ron played under Woody Hayes and replaced two-time Heisman Trophy winner Archie Griffin in the Buckeyes ' backfield . He went on to play for Tom Landry in Dallas . <p> Shawn was born when Ron was 18 , and was raised by his grandmother in Silver Spring , where he was a standout at Springbrook High School . Seattle drafted Springs third overall in 1997 ; he quickly became a Pro Bowl player and is a linchpin in Washington 's defense . Without his coverage skills , the Redskins would not be able to blitz as aggressively as they do . After being the only player in the NFL to lead his team in sacks and interceptions last season , teams have braced for his blitzes in 2005 and largely shied from his side of the field in the passing game . <p> " Shawn , because he played so well last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Gregg Williams , assistant head coach-defense . " With a rookie corner opposite of him Carlos Rogers , Springs does n't get the attempts , because it 's going at the rookie and it 's going at nickel back Walt Harris . So his presence has been good . " <p> Springs wishes he had produced more big plays through the first 13 games , but knows that the most significant stretch of the season is still ahead of him , with three straight games upcoming against NFC East opponents . As usual , he will hear from his father after each of them . <p> " We talk all the time , " Shawn Springs said . " He keeps on me , but I 'm pretty hard on myself . I go back and watch film and grade myself on my breaks , hand placement , hustle  --  all that stuff . That 's what my dad always talked about , especially my first few years in the league . He was pretty hard on me back then . " <p> Ron Springs will try not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that may not be easy . After all , the Redskins won the first meeting , 14-13 , on two late Santana Moss touchdowns . More importantly , he is relishing Dallas 's visit to Washington next year , when he plans to be cheering at FedEx Field with renewed health . <p> " I know I 'm going to get excited watching , " he said . " I 'm going to get excited whether it be the Redskins or the Cowboys ; I just flip hats , so I do n't feel too bad about anything when it comes to them . One will win and one will lose and 50 percent of me is happy all the time . So you tell all the people in the D.C. area that I 'm still a Cowboys fan , but I 've got to love the Redskins , too , and I will see all of them next year back in D.C. I 'm already looking forward to it . "
