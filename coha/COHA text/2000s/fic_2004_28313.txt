1 Mexico , 1993 Milla had fallen asleep while the baby was nursing . David Boone stood over his wife and child and watched them , aware of the silly grin on his face , of the fullness in his chest . His wife . His child . God , his world . The old fascination , the obsession , with medicine remained , but it was tempered now by something equally as fascinating . He 'd never suspected that the process of pregnancy and childbirth , of the rapid development of the infant , could be so engrossing . He 'd chosen the field of surgery because of the sheer challenge of it ; obstetrics , in comparison , had seemed kind of like watching grass grow . Well , sometimes things went wrong and the obstetrician had to be on top of things , but for the most part babies grew and were born , and that was that . He 'd thought that until it came to his own child . Clinically , he 'd known every detail of fetal growth , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round out , of feeling the small kicks and flutters of the baby grow into stronger , more demanding ones . And if the sheer emotionalism had blindsided him , how had Milla felt ? Sometimes , even during the physical misery of the last month of pregnancy , he 'd caught an expression on her face , a rapt , absorbed look as she unconsciously stroked her belly , that told him she was lost in a world inhabited only by herself and the baby . And then Justin had arrived , squalling and healthy , and David had felt light-headed with relief and euphoria . In the six weeks since , each day seemed to bring some small change as the infant grew ; the dark fuzz on his head had become blond , his eyes were more blue and alert . He wasnoticing things , recognizing voices , waving his arms and legs in a jerky , uncoordinated rhythm as his little muscles grew in strength . He loved his bath . He had an angry cry , a hungry cry , an uncomfortable cry , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference within days . The changes in his wife were fascinating , too . Milla had always had a way of holding herself apart from the world , as if she were more an observer than a participant . She 'd been a challenge from the moment he 'd first seen her , but he had stubbornly courted her until she could n't help but notice him as a person rather than a moving part of the scenery . He could remember perfectly the exact moment when he 'd won : they had been at a New Year 's Eve party and in the middle of all the laughter and drinking and general silliness , Milla had looked at him and blinked , a faintly startled expression crossing her face as if he had suddenly come into focus . That was it ; no hot kiss , no heartfelt exchanges in the night , just a sudden clarity in her gaze as she finally , truly saw him . Then she smiled and took his hand , and with that simple touch they were linked . Amazing . Okay , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work long enough to notice her at one of the deadly dull staff parties his professor parents often hosted , but once he had , he could n't get her face out of his mind . She was n't beautiful ; maybe she barely qualified as pretty . But there was something about her , in the strong , clean lines of her face and the way she walked , an almost gliding stride that made him think maybe her feet did n't quite touch the ground , that had kept consciousness of her nagging at him like a persistent mosquito . Learning about her had fascinated him . He liked knowing that her favorite color was green , that she did n't want pepperoni on her pizza , that she enjoyed action movies and , thank God , yawned at the idea of chick flicks , which was surprising because she was so essentially feminine . As she explained it , she already knew about woman stuff , so why would she want to watch more of the same ? Trivial stuff , mostly . He was beguiled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never seen it . She was the most evenly balanced person he 'd ever met , and even after two years of marriage he still could n't quite believe his luck . She yawned and stretched , the move popping her nipple out of the baby 's slack mouth , who grunted and made a few sucking motions , then was still . Fascinated , David reached out and stroked one gentle finger over the plump mound of her bare breast . He admitted it ; he was delighted with the new size of her breasts . Prepregnancy , Milla 's shape had been lean , like a long-distance runner 's . Now she was rounder , softer , and the postbirth moratorium on sex was driving him crazy . He could n't wait until tomorrow , when she had her six-week checkup from Susanna Kosper , the team 's ob-gyn . Actually , because of a couple of emergencies that played havoc with Susanna 's schedule , it was almost seven weeks now , and he was close to howling at the moon . Jerking off relieved the tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as making love to his wife . She opened her eyes and drowsily smiled at him . " Hey , Doogie , " she murmured . " Thinking about tomorrow night ? " He laughed , both at the nickname and how she 'd read his mindnot that reading his mind was any great feat . He 'd had little else besides sex on the brain for two months now . " Nothing else . " " Maybe Doogie Jr . will sleep all night . " She stroked a gentle hand over the baby 's fuzzy head , and he responded by making more sucking motions with his mouth . Simultaneously both adults said , " I doubt it , " and David laughed again . Justin had a voracious appetite ; he wanted feeding at least every two hours . Milla had been concerned that her breast milk was n't rich enough , or that she did n't have enough , but Justin was clearly thriving and Susanna said there was nothing to worry about , the baby was just a pig . Milla yawned again , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susanna will give you the all-clear tomorrow does n't mean we have to make love . If you 're too tired , we can wait . " Susanna had made damn certain he understood how exhausted a new mother was , especially if she was breast-feeding . Interrupted in mid-yawn , Milla glared at him . " Oh , yes , we do , " she said fiercely . " If you think I 'm going to wait another minuteJustin will be lucky if I do n't leave him with Susanna while I hunt you down at the clinic . " " Gon na hold a scalpel on me and make me strip ? " he asked , grinning . " It 's a thought . " She caught his hand and pulled it to her breast again , rubbing her nipple against his fingers . " It 's been over six weeks . We do n't have to wait for Susanna 's official okay . " He wanted to go with that idea . It had , in fact , occurred to him before , but he had n't wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was relieved she had brought up the idea first , and temptation gnawed at him . He glanced at his wristwatch and the time made him groan . " I have to be at the clinic in ten minutes . " Already people would be lining up outside the clinic doors , prepared to patiently wait for hours to see a doctor . He was the team surgeon , and in fact had a surgery scheduled in half an hour . He barely had enough time to get to the clinic , change , and get scrubbed . Not that he 'd need more than ten seconds to climax , the way he felt , but Milla definitely needed more time than that . " Tonight , then , " Milla said , turning on her side and smiling at him . " I 'll keep Justin awake as much as possible so he 'll sleep . " " Good plan . " He stood and reached for his keys . " What are you doing today ? " " Nothing much . I 'm going to the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get some oranges . " He 'd been on an orange kick lately , as if his body craved the vitamin C. He 'd been spending long hours in surgery , so maybe he did . He leaned down and kissed Milla , then brushed his lips against Justin 's satiny cheek . " Take good care of Mommy , " he told his sleeping son , and hurried out the door . Milla stayed in bed a few more minutes , luxuriating in the peace and quiet . Right this moment , no one was wanting anything of her . She had thought she was prepared to care for a baby , but somehow she had n't realized the work would be practically nonstop . When Justin was n't needing to be fed or changed , she was rushing around trying to keep up with all the other chores , and she was so tired that every step was like slogging through water . She had n't had a good night 's sleep in what felt like months . No , it had been months ; about four of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press on her bladder and she 'd had to pee practically every half hour . She had carried him low , which Susanna said made it easier to breathe , but the trade-off was peeing a lot . Being a mother was anything but glamorous ; rewarding , but definitely not glamorous . She knew she was beaming as she examined her sleeping son . He was so gorgeous ; everyone said so , exclaiming at his blond hair and blue eyes and the sweetness of his mouth . He looked like the Gerber baby , that idealized , big-eyed infant whose image graced millions of baby-care items . Milla was entranced by everything about him , from the tiny fingernails to the dimples that were forming as he gained weight . She could just sit and watch him all day long . . . if she did n't have so much else to do . Immediately her mind switched into work mode as she remembered everything that needed to be done today , such as laundry , cleaning , cooking , and , whenever she had a spare moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And sometime today she needed to take care of girly things like washing her hair and shaving her legs , because she had a hot date with her husband tonight . She would never get tired of being a mother , but she was definitely ready to be something else , too , like a sexually desirable woman . She missed sex ; David made love with the same total concentration he gave to everything else that interested him , which was very nice when one was the recipient of said concentration . Actually , it was better than nice . It was pretty damn wonderful . First , though , she would go to the market , before the day got too hot . Only two more months here , she thought . She would miss Mexico : the people , the sunshine , the slowness of time . The year David and his colleagues had donated to the free-care clinic was almost over ; then it would be back to the rat race of practicing medicine in the States . Not that she would n't be glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niceties as an air-conditioned supermarket . She wanted to do things like take Justin for walks in the park or visit with her mom dur- ing the day . She had missed her mother a lot during the long months of her pregnancy , and sporadic phone calls plus one quick visit home just had n't filled the need . She had almost decided not to come to Mexico with David ; she found out she was pregnant just before they were scheduled to leave . But she had n't wanted to spend such a long time away from him , especially while she was carrying their first child . After meeting Susanna , the ob-gyn part of the medical team , she had decided to stick to their original plan . Her mother had been horrifiedher grandchild would be born in another country ! but the pregnancy had gone by the book , without any medical problems arising . Justin had arrived almost on time , just two days past her due date , and since then Milla had felt as if she existed in a fog composed of equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how she had imagined her life would be that she could n't help but feel amused . Armed with her grand liberal arts degree , she had planned to change the world , one person at a time . She was going to be the kind of teacher people remembered when they themselves were grandparents , the kind of teacher who made a real difference in her students ' lives . She was comfortable in academia , even the highly political side of it ; she had planned to continue her education until she received her doctorate , then teach at a university . Marriageyes , after a while . Maybe when she was thirty or thirty-five . Childrenmaybe . Instead she had met David , a wunderkind of medicine . He was the son of her history professor , and when she became the professor 's student assistant , she learned all about him . David 's IQ was way above genius level ; he 'd finished high school at fourteen , college at seventeen , blew through medical school , and was already a practicing surgeon at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected him to be either an arrogant know-it-allwith some justificationor a total egghead . He was neither . Instead he was a good-looking young man whose face was often lined with exhaustion from long hours in surgery and augmented by a bottomless need for more knowledge that kept him poring over medical books long after he should have been asleep . His smile was sweet and sexy , his blue eyes full of good humor , his blond hair usually shaggy and disordered . He was tall , which she liked , since she was five-seven and liked to wear high heels . Actually , she liked everything about him , and when he asked her out she had n't hesitated at all . Still , she 'd been surprised , at a New Year 's Eve party , to catch him staring at her with dark , potent desire in his eyes . Realization had hit her like a blow to the stomach , as if Joshua had blown his horn and all the walls had come tumbling down . David loved her , and she loved him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-one , as soon as she got her degree , and now at twenty-three she was a mother . She did n't regret a minute of it . She still planned to teach , when they returned to the States , and she still planned to further her education , but she would n't undo a single decision that had led to the small miracle that was her son . From the moment she 'd realized she was pregnant , she 'd been consumed by the process , and so in love with the baby that she felt as if she were lit from the inside with a powerful , incandescent glow . That feeling was even stronger now , to the point that she felt the tug between her and Justin even if he was just in the next room sleeping . No matter how tired she was , she reveled in that connection . She got out of bed and carefully placed the pillows around the baby , even though he could n't yet roll over . He did n't move while she quickly washed , dragged a brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the loose sundresses she had brought specifically to wear after giving birth . She was still fifteen pounds heavier than she 'd been before getting pregnant , but the extra weight did n't bother her . . . much . She kind of liked the motherly softness , and David certainly liked the way her breasts had expanded from a B cup to a D. She thought of the coming night and shivered with anticipation . A week ago David had brought home a box of condoms from the clinic , and the mere presence of the box had made them both a little crazy . They had used condoms for a short while when they first became lovers ; then she had been on birth control pills until they had decided to have a baby . Having to use the condoms again made her feel as if it were the first time all over again , when they were in a frenzy to have each other and everything was so new and intense and scary . Justin began squirming a little , his mouth pursing as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tiny fists began waving , and he made the grunting sound that preceded his " I 'm wet , change me , " cry . Pulled from a daydream about making love with his daddy , Milla got a clean diaper and bent over him , cooing as she changed him . He managed to focus his gaze on her face , and he stared at her as if nothing else existed in his universe , his mouth open with delight , his arms and legs pumping . " There 's mommy 's baby , " she crooned as she lifted him . As soon as she settled him in the crook of her arm , he began rooting at her breast . " Make that mommy 's pig , ' " she amended , sitting down and unbuttoning the front of her dress . Her breasts tingled in response , and she sighed with pure pleasure as the baby latched onto her nipple and began sucking . Gently she rocked back and forth , playing with his fingers and toes as he nursed . Her eyes closed dreamily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could do without the dirty diapers and loss of sleep , but she loved this part of being a mother . When she held him like this , nothing else mattered . He finished nursing , and she put him down again while she grabbed a quick bite of breakfast . After brushing her teeth , she draped a blue denim sling over her head and put the baby in it . He settled down with his head resting where he could hear her heartbeat , his blue eyes already drooping shut as he dozed . Grabbing a hat and a basket , with money in her pocket , she set out for the market . The walk was only about half a mile . The bright morn- ing sun promised to deliver scorching heat by midday , but for now the air was cool and dry , and the small open-air village market was busy with early shoppers . There were oranges and brightly colored peppers , bananas and melons , yellow onions on strings . Milla browsed , occasionally chatting with some of the village women as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in picking out the produce she wanted . Justin was curled in the ball shape of the very young , his legs still automatically drawing up into his prebirth position . She held her hat so it shielded him from the sun . A soft , pleasant breeze played in her short , light brown curls and lifted the baby 's wispy blond fuzz . He stirred , his rosebud mouth making sucking motions . Milla set down her basket and patted his tiny back , and he lapsed back into sleep . She stopped at a display of fruit and began carrying on an animated , if fractured , conversation with the old woman behind the stacks of oranges and melons . Her understanding was better than her speech , but she managed to make herself understood . She used her free hand to point to the oranges she wanted . She did n't see them coming . Suddenly two men were bracketing her , their body heat and odor assailing her . Instinctively she started to step back , only to find herself blocked by their bodies closing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife from the sheath at his waist and grasped the straps of the sling , hastily slicing through them before Milla could do more than give a startled cry . Time seemed to stutter , giving her freeze-frame impressions of the next few seconds . The old woman fell back , her expression alarmed . Milla felt the sling that held Justin to her begin to drop , and in panic she grabbed for her baby . The man on her left snatched the baby from her with one hand , and shoved at her with the other . Somehow she kept her balance , terror twisting in her chest as she leapt at the man , screaming , fighting to wrest her baby from him . Her clawing nails scratched down his face , leaving bloody furrows , and he reeled back from the assault . The baby , startled awake , was wailing . The milling crowd scattered , alarmed by the sudden violence . " Help ! " she shrieked over and over as she tried to grab Justin , but everyone seemed to be running away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shove her away again , his hand on her face . Milla bit him , sinking her teeth into his hand and grinding down until she felt blood in her mouth and he was yelling in pain . She clawed for his eyes , her nails sinking into spongy softness . His yells turned into shocked bellows , and his grip on Justin loosened . Desperately she grabbed at the baby , managing to catch one tiny , flailing arm , and for one heart-bursting moment she thought she had him . Then she felt the other man moving in close behind her , and a searing , paralyzing pain shot through her back . Her body convulsed and she dropped like a rock to the ground , her fingers scrabbling helplessly in the grit . With the baby clutched like a football under one assailant 's arm , the two men raced away , one holding a bloody hand over his face and screaming curses as he fled . Milla lay sprawled in the dirt as she tried to fight through the agony that gripped her body , fight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to be dragging in any air . She tried to get up ; her body did n't respond . A black veil began closing over her vision , and she managed to whimper , over and over , " My baby ! My baby ! Someone get my baby ! " No one did . David had already repaired a hernia and was washing up while Rip Kosper , Susanna 's husband and the team anesthesiologist , did a final check of the patient 's blood pressure and heart rate to make sure he was okay before turning him over to Anneli Lansky , the nurse , for monitoring . They had a good group working here ; he 'd miss them when the year was up and they all returned to regular practice in the States . He would n't miss the cramped , one-story concrete-block clinic , with its cracked tile floors and barely adequate equipment , but he 'd definitely miss the group as well as his patientsand he 'd miss Mexico itself . He was thinking about the next case , a gallbladder , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . There was shouting and cursing , some scuffling sounds , and high-pitched wails . He dried his hands and started for the door just as Juana Mendoza , another nurse , began yelling for him . He hit the door , already running , and skidded to a halt in the hallway before he rammed into a knot of people that included Juana , Susanna Kosper , and two men and a woman who were clumsily carrying another woman . The crush of bodies hid the wounded woman 's face , but David could see that her dress was drenched with blood and he immediately switched into emergency mode . " What happened ? " he asked as he kicked a box out of the way and dragged over a gurney . " David . " Susanna 's voice was tight and sharp . " It 's Milla . " For a moment the words did n't make sense and he looked around , expecting to see his wife behind him . Then Susanna 's meaning kicked in and he saw the wounded woman 's unconscious , paper-white face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and everything tilted out of kilter . Milla ? This could n't be Milla . She was at home with Justin , safe and sound . This woman who looked as if she 'd bled out just resembled his wife , that was all . It was n't really Milla . " David ! " This time Susanna 's tone was even sharper . " Snap out of it ! Help us get her on the gurney . " Only his training enabled him to function , to step in and lift the woman who looked like Milla onto the gurney . Her dress was bloody , her arms and hands were bloody , her legs and feet and even her shoes were bloody . Nojust one shoe , a sandal that looked just like a pair Milla often wore . He saw the pink nail polish on her toenails , and the delicate gold chain around her right ankle , and he felt as if all his insides caved in . " What happened ? " he asked , his voice hoarse and faraway and not his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly wheeled Milla into the surgical bay he had just left . " Knife wound to the lower back , " Juana said , listening to the babble of voices around them before they closed the door and shut out most of the noise . " Two men attacked her at the market . " She caught a shuddering breath . " They took Justin . Milla fought them , and one of the men stabbed her . " Rip , alerted by the hubbub , burst back into the room . " My God , " he blurted when he saw Milla ; then he fell silent and began readying his equipment . Justin ! David reeled from the second shock , and he half turned toward the door . Two bastards had stolen his son ! He actually took a step away from the gurney , toward the door , to race out and search for his baby . Then he hesitated , and looked back at his wife . They had n't had time to clean the operating room , or restock the supplies on the trays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Juana wrapped a blood pressure cuff around Milla 's limp arm and swiftly pumped it up , while Susanna used the shears to cut away Milla 's clothing . " Blood type O positive , " Susanna was saying . How did she know ? Oh , yeah , she 'd typed Milla 's blood before Justin 's delivery . " Sixty over forty , " Juana reported . Moving so fast her actions were a blur , she started an IV line in Milla 's arm and hooked up a bag of blood plasma . He was losing her , David thought . Milla would die right in front of him , unless he snapped out of his shock and acted . From the position of the wound , the knife had probably hit her left kidney , and God knows what other damage had been done . She was bleeding out ; she had only a few minutes left before her internal organs began shutting down He pushed everything else out of his mind , and shoved his hands into the fresh pair of gloves Anneli held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; he did n't have time to search for Justin ; all he had time to do was reach for the scalpel that was promptly slapped into his palm and call on every ounce of skill he had . He prayed , he cursed , and he fought time as he cut into his wife 's body . As he 'd suspected , the knife blade had hit her left kidney . Hit it , hell ; it had all but sliced the organ in half . There was no saving the kidney , and if he did n't get it out and the blood vessels tied off in record time , there would be no saving Milla , either . It was a race , savage and merciless . If he made one misstep , if he hesitated , if anything was dropped or even fumbled , then he lost , and Milla lost . It was n't surgery as he was accustomed to doing it ; it was battlefield surgery , fast and brutal , with her life hanging on every split-second decision and action . While they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought to keep it from pouring out of her just as fast as it went in . Moment by moment he stemmed the bleeding , searched out every severed vessel , and slowly he began to win the race . He did n't know how long it took ; he never asked , never found out . How long did n't matter . All that mattered was winning , because the alternative was more than he could bear .
