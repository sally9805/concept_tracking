Chapter One Magic Words Hard , ugly , summer-vacation-spoiling rain fell for three straight months in 1979 . Atlanta downpours destroyed hopscotch markers carefully chalked onto asphalt and stole the bounce from yellow tennis balls forgotten in backyards . On the few days the rain did n't fall , children scurried to play 1-2-3 Redlight under low-hanging gray clouds . Red Georgia clay clung to inexpensive canvas sneakers and the kids tracked it into light-carpeted living rooms . Mothers slapped their narrow behinds with leather belts before dabbing at the marked floors with wet rags , worrying about the expense of carpet cleaners or loss of deposits . When the rain fell , it did so to an accompaniment of growling thunder and purple zigzag lightning . Bored kids were told to sit still . Be quiet . God is talking . The children listened to the water smack against the windowpanes and figured that God 's message must not have been meant for them to understand . But on the first day of school , the students at Oglethorpe Elementary did not sweat inside yellow plastic jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tromped on broken sidewalks with brightly colored book satchels and lunch boxes . The unfamiliar light turned the girls ' plastic barrettes into prisms , casting rainbows on their cheeks . Everybody wished the sun had come out the day before , when they had been free to chase the ice-cream man . But this , they kept to themselves . Perhaps someone said under her breath , but still out loud , Why the sun had to come out today when we got to go to school ? And maybe God heard . For although fifth-graders could n't understand God 's language , no one doubted that He knew theirs . By recess , the sky was as gray as it had been the day before , but the fifth-graders went outside anyway . Although they had looked forward to moving to the trailers recently added to the rear of the old school building , and standing apart from the lower grades , the windowless metal room was claustrophobic and cheerless , foiling the bright bulletin boards ' attempts to welcome them back . At noon , the children stampeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the last to leave the trailer , carrying the heavy jump rope that had been coiled since school let out last June . Jumping rope had been the proving ground for girls as long as she could remember , and for equally as long , Tasha had been embarrassingly incompetent . This was fifth grade , the last year of grade school ; next year she would go to Southwest Middle School , which was closer to her house . Her parents had chosen Oglethorpe Elementary School because it was near her mother 's work , which was good when Tasha was little . Mama could get to the school in less than five minutes if need be . But now that Tasha was getting to be a young lady , Mama and Daddy thought that it would be better for her to be on her own side of town , rather than across the street from the projects . Because this year would be her last chance to make a place for herself among the girls in her class , Tasha had devoted most of the vacation to improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , she had practiced in her basement , tying one end of the rope to a wooden chair and forcing her eight-year-old sister , De-Shaun , to turn the other end . Tasha had worked on all the skipping rhymes . She was best at " Ice Cream " and could get very near the end of the alphabet before losing her footing . But she had decided already that she would deliberately falter at " P " since there was no boy in her class whose name began with that initial . After untangling the rope , she held one end in her hand and waited for someone else to grab the other , but no one did . " Y'all do n't want to jump ? " she asked . A small kneesocked cluster of girls shrugged in unison and looked toward Monica Fisher , the best rope skipper ever seen in Georgia . She had been born in Chicago where the girls skipped two ropes at once and chanted rhymes that sometimes included cuss words . " Nah , " said Monica . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me sweat out my hair . " She stroked her straightened page boy , pulled off her face with a wide headband . Tasha noticed horizontal imprints where rollers had been fastened . Tasha dropped the rope as if it were hot . She had washed her hair for the first day of school , but Mama had not subjected her to the torture of a pressing comb . Now she was unprepared . " That 's alright , " Tasha said . " I did n't really want to jump . There 's just not nothing else to do . " " Look at her just lying , " said Forsythia Collier , Monica 's best friend . Forsythia 's hair was also pressed , and her oily ringlets coiled all the way to her shoulders . " She probably practiced all summer . " Monica laughed a little louder than was appropriate and continued her cackle until the other girls joined her . Tasha decided to laugh too . Did n't Mama tell her that a person needed to be able to laugh at herself ? And besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monica and Forsythia . Then the rain started and Tasha was relieved , although she groaned along with everyone else as they ran toward the tin box that was their classroom this year . She even cried out , " My hair ! " although her tight cornrows were impervious to climate . Inside the trailer , the noise of the rain on the roof rose into magnificent crescendos with the wind . " Let 's play jacks , " Tasha shouted over the weather . " Okay , " Monica said . Tasha turned her head to hide her smile as she reached into her book bag for the purple felt sack that held twenty jacks and a purple rubber ball . Jumping rope was n't the only thing she had practiced over the summer . The girls made a clearing by pushing all of the desk chairs over to one corner . Most of the boys argued over comic books under the supervision of their new teacher , Mr. Harrell . Tasha sat cross-legged on the floor across from Monica while her classmates breathed over them with gumball breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five can play jacks . " " No , " Monica said . " Let 's just let it be us . " " Okay , " Tasha said , tossing the tiny pieces of metal . Tasha won , as she had planned to , but she meant to quit before whipping Monica 's siditty tail . But she could n't make herself stop showboating , demonstrating all the techniques she had perfected over the long , wet summer vacation . She even knew maneuvers that none of them had seen before , things Tasha 's mother learned as a kid in Oklahoma . Midwestern jacks had an entirely different flavor . The girls clapped when Tasha perfectly executed an around-the-world with double bounce and tap . Even a few boys came over and watched . " Dang , " Roderick Palmer , the cutest boy in class , said behind his hand . " She killing Monica . " Tasha could n't resist saying , " Wan na play again ? " although it was clear that Monica had had enough . Monica heaved herself from the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her training bra . " That 's alright . " She dusted off her pants with sharp whacks . " I just let you win because my mother told me that everyone is supposed to be nice to you because your parents are getting separated and everything . " " Uh-uh , " Tasha clarified . " They 're not separated . They 're living apart right now . It 's different . " She paused for a minute , trying to explain what was different about her household and Monica 's , or that of any of the other kids who did n't have a father anymore . She still had her daddy . He called her on the telephone almost every night and picked her up from ballet lessons on Tuesdays . Separated was different , harsher . Almost as bad as divorce . And not once had her parents used that word . Monica laughed and touched Forsythia with her pointed elbow , soliciting a complicit chuckle . " It 's just for a little while , " Tasha insisted . A warmth spread from her chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , " she shouted at Monica 's back , " my mother says your parents live outside their means ! " No one watching responded to Tasha 's comeback . Monica , who had taken a sudden interest in the boys ' comic book wars , did n't even turn around . Only Rodney Green , the weirdest kid in class , seemed to ponder her remark . With his face extended by two cheeks full of bubble gum , he studied her with scrunched brows behind his glasses , until Tasha felt uncomfortable and turned away . She went to the girls ' room , sat in a stall , and rested her humiliation in the palms of her hands . Closing her eyes hard to stifle tears the way pressing down on a cut stops bleeding , Tasha felt dumb as a rock . Two weeks earlier , Daddy had moved out . Tasha was n't so dumb that she did n't realize this was trouble . At first , when he and Mama came to tell her , Tasha thought they were going to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tayari Jones just last year . Tayari told everyone in class that her parents had come into her room smiling and holding hands and-just like that-told her that there would be a new baby in the house in August . So what was Tasha to think when Mama and Daddy knocked softly on her bedroom door and silently stepped over the clutter , holding hands ? They never held hands or really touched each other , except a quick smack on the lips on each other 's birthdays . Thank you , baby . Then the kiss . And true enough , they had n't been smiling like Tayari 's parents . Mama held Daddy 's hand tight so that her knuckles stood out and her face had worn a sorry , stretched look , like her chin was too heavy and was pulling her round face into a sad oval . But Tasha figured this was an appropriate precursor to news about an impending baby . Where in the world were they going to put it ? In the guest room ? It did n't seem fair that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share with DeShaun . And if the guest room was to be full of baby , then where would Nana stay when she came to visit from Birmingham ? She knew Mama and Daddy were n't going to suggest putting it in here with her and DeShaun . There was not enough room for their two canopy beds and a crib . " What ? " Tasha said , looking at Mama 's abdomen . Daddy pulled his hand from Mama 's and touched Tasha 's face . " Wait till DeShaun gets here . " Tasha climbed onto her bed and hugged her knees . This was serious . Twins ? Oh , Jesus . ( She could take the Lord 's name in vain all she wanted to as long as she did n't do it out loud . ) One little sister was more than enough , really . She could imagine twins in identical prams . People would be saying how precious they were and how cute . It would be like being the only regular girl in a class full of pretty people . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at home would be unbearable . Tasha wished she had X-ray vision so she could look right in Mama 's stomach and see what was going on under the brown blouse tucked into the waistband of her tan slacks . Her stomach poked out a little bit , but not any more than anyone else 's mother 's did . Or did it ? Mama ran her hand across her front , flattening the pleats . There was the sound of a toilet flushing and DeShaun came in . " What ? " the little girl said , looking from her parents to her older sister and back . " We been waiting for you so we can find out , " Tasha said . " I was using the bathroom , " DeShaun whined . " Tasha , " Mama said , " do n't snap at her like that . " " All I said was ? " Daddy cleared his throat . " Delores . " He took Mama 's hand again , but she did n't wrap her fingers around his . He let go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His fingernails were neat rectangles against their dark hair . " Girls , " he said , " I love you very much . " Especially DeShaun , Tasha thought . She could remember the time before DeShaun was born . Mama said she could n't possibly since they were only twenty-three months apart , but Tasha did remember and she knew that people used to love her more back then . What would life be like after the twins ? She turned her face toward the wall and Daddy gently twisted her head so she had to look at his sober and unhappy brown face . " And I love your mother too . " He turned toward Mama , who seemed to be studying her knees . " But your mother and I think that it is best if we live apart right now . " Tasha looked up at him quickly . There was no baby ? " For a while , " he said , looking at Tasha before turning to look at Mama . " For a while , " Mama echoed . " Just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tasha said fast . Relieved . Her little sister DeShaun pulled a piece of loose skin from her wobbly bottom lip . Now , Tasha felt stupid . Monica was right . Tasha was immature . And Daddy was in the wrong too . He should have said , Tasha , DeShaun , your mother and I have been playing with matches and your whole life is on fire . After school that first day , Tasha did not wipe her feet before coming into the house . After leaving her wet umbrella on the carpet , she tramped into the kitchen leaving mad , muddy , size-six prints on the floors . She drank juice from three different glasses and did n't rinse a single one out . Frustrated , she flopped onto the couch and put her feet up on it . " You 're not supposed to put your feet up on that sofa , " DeShaun reminded her . Ignoring her little sister , Tasha placed her glass on the coffee table without a coaster . " Did you know Mama and Daddy were separated ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's that ? " Tasha searched her mind . " It 's the same thing as divorce . " " I do n't know what that is either . " " Divorce is when the parents are n't together anymore . When the dad lives someplace else . " " I already know that Daddy is living someplace else . " DeShaun looked confused . " You know that too , right ? " " Yeah , I know that much . " Tasha was insulted . " I 'm asking you if you knew they were separated . " " And I said what 's that , " DeShaun protested . Separated was kids who only had a mother to come and hear them say a poem on Black History Day . Or the ones who had stepfathers that they called by their first names . Ayana McWhorter , Tasha 's best friend , had one named Rex who did n't like Ayana or any of her friends . He was young , according to Mama , clicking her tongue against the back of her teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thin with a narrow scar on the side of his face , which he tried to hide with a thick beard . ( Unkempt , according to Mama . ) Tasha would n't have noticed the scar at all if Ayana had n't pointed it out : That 's where someone tried to kill him . After that , Ayana always came over to Tasha 's house to play because Tasha did n't like going over to her house and Mama did n't think much of the idea either . Continues ...
