<p> WASHINGTON  --  Texas Gov . George W. Bush initially won over some key swing voters who often vote Democratic with a message of " compassionate conservatism " and an emphasis on education . But many of them are moving back to Vice President Gore , making the presidential race nearly even . <p> The voters : Women . <p> Specifically , married women in suburbs and small towns who have children at home and full-time jobs . They include not only the upscale " soccer moms " who gained renown in 1996 , but also less affluent " waitress moms . " Together they make up about 20% of the electorate and might hold the key to the White House this year . <p> " It 's a huge group and it 's the margin of victory , " Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says . " There are other groups one would like to get , but these voters already have shown real swing " between the candidates . <p> When Bush was scoring double-digit leads over Gore in national polls last year , it was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . Now Bush 's overall lead has nearly vanished because Gore has regained support among women , although he still trails distantly among men . <p> If the election were held today , women would elect Gore president by a narrow 50%-44% margin , according to a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll during the weekend . Men would elect Bush by a yawning 21 points , 56%-35% . That margin gave Bush an overall lead over Gore of 49%-43% . <p> The telephone survey of 502 likely voters has a margin of error of +/  --  5 percentage points . <p> Despite the gains Gore has made in recent weeks , the battle for female voters is a sign of weakness as the general election campaign effectively begins . He is being forced to defend a traditional Democratic advantage against a determined Republican campaign . <p> If he succeeds in holding the support of women , Gore then will have to address his deficit among men , where Bush has widened the traditional Republican advantage . <p> At the moment , though , both Bush and Gore are wooing women in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues they emphasize , the audiences they choose to appear before and the ads they air . <p> Can Bush win them back ? <p> He did well with female voters in Texas , splitting women 's votes evenly in 1994 against an incumbent Democratic woman , Ann Richards , and winning 65% of women 's votes in his runaway reelection in 1998 . <p> " Gov . Bush talks frequently in a way that Republicans usually do n't about the needs of women , " campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer says . In his stump speech , Bush says single mothers have " the toughest job in America " and casts his tax-cut plan as helping them . In TV ads , he has emphasized his record on education  - -  an issue with appeal to women . <p> " I know it sounds goofy , but this is how I look at the election : If I were to leave my children with one of the presidential candidates , whom would I want them to be with ? " says Brenda Bidoli , 38 , of Duncansville , Pa . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 8 and 11 , says she plans to vote for Bush . <p> Whitney Merrill , 29 , of Dawson Spring , Ky. , wrestles with similar issues and plans to vote for Gore , although her original choice was Republican John McCain . A graphic designer who runs a small business out of her home , Merrill gave birth to her first child two weeks ago . <p> " Especially just having had a son and everything , I 'm really scared about the whole public school system " and highly publicized incidents of violence involving children , she says . " I really wish they could get the gun thing with kids under control . " <p> Primary advantage <p> Both Bush and Gore have the presidential nominations in hand , in part because of the disproportionate support they received from women in the primaries . Democratic rival Bill Bradley , a former New York Knicks basketball player , and GOP rival John McCain , a heroic prisoner of war in Vietnam , each drew heavier support from men than women . <p> Of course , women do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . But women as a group have voted in notably different ways from men since Ronald Reagan 's 1980 campaign spawned the phenomenon known as the gender gap . Since then , every Democratic presidential candidate has fared better among women than men . <p> This time , Bush aims to neutralize that Democratic advantage , including with his relative youth and likability . " He 's a very open and expansive person , and it 's clear women are comfortable with that , " Republican pollster Linda Divall says . He seems more likely to understand modern-day women 's lives than , say , the 73-year-old Bob Dole did in 1996 . <p> One of Gore 's top strategists , Bob Shrum , scoffs at Bush 's chances of success once his record is scrutinized . " They think saying the word ' education ' is the same thing as having an education policy , " he says , arguing that Bush 's rightward steer during the hard-fought South Carolina primary already has cost him the " compassionate conservative " label . <p> Other Democrats acknowledge that keeping female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general-election campaign . " If Bush can get them , it would be a big problem , " says Lake , who occasionally advises the Gore campaign . <p> " Bush is going to do better among women than any Republican candidate since his father " received 50% of female vote in 1988 , GOP pollster Frank Luntz predicts . <p> What 's his strategy ? <p> " There is a language one can use that does n't scream ' gender ' " but does appeal to women by striking themes they care most about , says Kathleen Hall Jamieson , dean of the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania . " If women hear that you 're identifying with them without shouting , ' I 'm appealing to you , ' it 's a far more effective message and one that 's less likely to alienate men . " <p> So when Bush attacked McCain before last week 's Super Tuesday primaries for failing to support funding for breast cancer research , he was appealing to moderate women . <p> When Gore pushes his plan to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , a group that is more likely than men to care for aging parents . <p> Roderick Hart , a University of Texas professor and author of a new book , Campaign Talk , on the language of campaigns , says " education " has become a code word for female voters . <p> Consider the candidates ' speeches last week after winning the Super Tuesday contests and vanquishing their party rivals . <p> * Bush began by thanking Phyllis Whiting , a teacher from Houston who introduced him , for her work in " one of the most important jobs in America . " Then he highlighted a litany of issues with special appeal to women . " We must . . . be a party of inclusion , a party with a generous heart and an open door , " he said . He promised to " reach across party lines to strengthen and preserve Social Security " and said , " As president , I am going to rescue children from failure and return excellence to American education . " <p> * Gore began by thanking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who had introduced him . He called " for an America of tolerance and high ideals " and said his campaign would be a " cause " for strengthening Social Security and Medicare , expanding health care , protecting the environment and bringing about " revolutionary improvements in education . " In a comment that would resonate with Whitney Merrill , the graphic designer , he added , " If your heart is burdened with the news of a gun death of a 6-year-old in a first-grade classroom at the hand of a classmate , then join us now for common-sense ( gun control ) measures . " <p> The male vote <p> What about men ? <p> The flip side of the gender gap is men , now solidly in Bush 's camp . In the latest USA TODAY poll , only about one in three men backed Gore . <p> " We 'll make gains there over the course of the campaign , " Shrum insists . <p> In time , aides say , Gore will focus on increasing his support among men with an argument that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the economy being the same sort of top-tier issue for many men that education is for many women . <p> In the current survey , men say Bush would be better at handling the economy and taxes , and at " ensuring that the next generation can live better than their parents " ; women pick Gore as better in all three categories . <p> Men say Bush would be better at dealing with " the problems of raising children in today 's culture " ; women pick Gore . Men say Bush would better deal with the rising price of gasoline ; women pick Gore . <p> " Women like candidates who compromise more , and they 're more inclined to candidates who are compassionate  --  no surprise there , " says Andrew Kohut , director of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center . But men " consistently give Gore significantly lower ratings on whether he is a ' strong leader . ' " <p> Kohut says Gore 's clean-cut image might put off men . <p> " What hurts him is this image of coming across as the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Men just hate that . " <p> The dueling views of the candidates extend even to the frivolous . In a USA TODAY poll , men say they 'd prefer to have dinner with Bush ; women chose Gore . Men say they 'd trust Bush more to baby-sit their children ; women chose Gore . <p> On more substantive issues , men and women often have different priorities and different perspectives . They differ in their view of government and their sense of the fragility of their world , factors that make women more likely to vote Democratic . <p> " A majority of women say government could help the average family while a majority of men say government is more the problem than the solution , " Lake says . " When you ask , ' Do you think you or someone in your family could need a safety-net program in the next 10 years ? ' two-thirds of women say ' yes ' and two-thirds of men say ' no . ' " <p> Many female voters now feel " cross-pressured , " she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and health care while Bush is better on values like responsibility and discipline . <p> " Moral issues is one of the main things this country lacks , " says Rosemary Dean , 44 , of Clarksville , Ohio . She is backing Bush for his stance against abortion and his moral values , saying Gore is " shadowed " by his association with President Clinton and his personal scandals . <p> Gloria Caban , 39 , of Bronx , N.Y. , says Bush may be a stronger leader , but she is looking for other qualities in the next president . <p> " At one time we needed protection , to show we were a power , but we 're not in that position nowadays , " she said in a phone interview amid sounds of working in the kitchen , fixing dinner . " So I 'm looking for things that will matter to me at home . " <p> She shares a characteristic of many of the working mothers : a strong desire for a good night 's sleep .
