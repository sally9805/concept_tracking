Chapter One Help me ! Maggie froze . The old Maxwell House coffee can she used as a grain scoop slipped from her fingers . It hit the floor . Barn ! Oats sprayed . Horses tossed their heads and neighed . Her legs buckled , and she grabbed hold of a rough-hewn post supporting the hayloft . Maggie , please ! Only you can help me . " ' Mary Theresa ? " Maggie mouthed , though no sound passed her lips . Was it possible ? After all these years would her sister 's voice reach her ? The barn seemed suddenly airless . Close . Cold sweat collected on her scalp though the mercury level in the old thermometer tacked onto the wall near the door dipped below fifty degrees . It was Thane . He did this to me . The voice pulsed through her brain . Thane Walker . Mary Theresa 's ex-husband and the one man Maggie never wanted to lay eyes upon again . " Did what ? " This time she spoke out loud , though her throat was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her mouth long gone . Maggie , please , do n't let him get away with it ... " Where are you ? " she cried , spinning , looking up to the ancient rafters where an owl had taken up residence . Feathers and dust motes swirled in the faint shaft of light from a lone , circular window mounted near the ceiling . She knew that spoken wordswere useless . Mary Theresa was hundreds of miles away . So far . So damned far . Squeezing her eyes shut , she tried to throw her thoughts to wherever her twin might be . But it would n't work . It never had . Nonetheless , she tried screaming in her mind : Mary Theresa , can you hear me ? Can you ? What did that bastard do to you ? She waited . Nothing . A restless mare snorted . " If this is some kind of sick joke ... " she said , though her heart was pounding a million beats a second . " Mary Theresa , I swear ... " Anxious , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted in their stalls , hooves rustling the straw , muscles quivering under coats that were becoming shaggy as winter approached . Maggie shuddered , the inside of her skin quivering as it always had when Mary Theresa had contacted her through their own special means . Mental telepathy . Instinct . Magic . Witchcraft . ESP . Clairvoyance . Maggie had heard all the terms and slurs , knew that most people considered her eccentric at best and just plain crazy at worst . Slowly , her lingers sliding down the post and gathering slivers , she sank to her knees and rested her head against the solid wood . She concentrated , willing her breathing to return to normal . Come on , Mary Theresa , come on . One more time . Eyes closed so tightly they ached , she strained to hear , but the only sounds that reached her ears were the constant rustle of hooves in straw , hot breath blowing out of nervous nostrils , the scratch of tiny claws as mice scurried along the concrete floor , hiding in the cracks and crevices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she whispered , her teeth sinking into her lower lip until she tasted blood . Nothing . " Damn you , Mary Theresa ... or Marquise or whoever you think you are . Talk to me ! " The inside of the barn felt as if it were freezing , and yet cold perspiration broke out all over her skin . " Mary Theresa- " " Mom ? " Becca 's voice sounded far away . The door to the barn creaked open , and a shaft of fading daylight sliced into the musty interior . " Hey , are you okay ? " " Fine , " she forced out , climbing to her feet and dusting her hands on her jeans . She managed a weak smile , hoping it would mask her lie a little . Becca with her freckled face , eyes a little too large and a lot too serious for the age of thirteen , was instantly suspicions . " What were you doing in here ? " She motioned to the post . " Praying ? " " No- " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , have a heart attack or a stroke or what ? " " I was just feeding the horses and I , urn , needed ... a rest . " Maggie cringed inside because the lie was so ridiculous , but what could she say ? That her sister , whom she had n't heard from in months , was finally contacting her through telepathy ? She 'd learned from past experience that no one would believe her , especially not her nearly estranged daughter . Becca eyed the empty coffee can that had rolled against a budap sack of feed . " Right . " " I was . I just ... well , if you want to know the truth- " " That would be a change . " " Becca , " she reproached , then held her tongue . The strain between them was palpable . Mother and daughter . How had they grown so far apart when they had once been inseparable ? " I- " Oh , God , how would she explain this-this connection she had with her twin ? This weird way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It ... It was ... just a little spell . " " A little spell ? " Rebecca repeated , nodding her head as if she had expected just such an answer from a mother she could no longer trust , a woman who had single-handedly ruined her life . Turning away , she did n't bother hiding the fact that she rolled her eyes . Frustration caused a headache to pound behind Maggie 's eyes , and her fingers curled into fists . She 'd love to tell Beeca the math , but then her daughter would just think she was crazy . Anyone who had heard her try and explain about the odd connection she had with Mary Theresa did . " Yes . A spell . When you get older- " " You 're only thirty-seven , Mom . You keep telling me it 's not exactly ancient . " Thirty-seven and sometimes it feels like seventy . " Maybe you should see a doctor . Another one . " Was there just the hint of concern beneath the sarcasm ? " Maybe I will . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a push broom hanging from a nail . " Nothing to worry about . " She swept with long , sure strokes , though she was still shaken . There was a chance she had n't heard anything after all . Maybe she was just overworked-exhausted from the move and the emotional turmoil that she 'd been through . Becea lifted a thin adolescent shoulder . Beneath her baggy polar fleece sweater and faded jeans , she showed off the beginnings of a womanly figure . " I , urn , thought I 'd go for a ride . " " The sun 's gon na set soon . " " I wo n't be gone long . What do you care anyway ? " " I cam , okay ? " " But I 'll take Jasper . You said yourself he 's more surefooted than any other horse you 've ever seen . " It was useless to argue . No reason to . Becca was right . " Just he back soon , okay ? For dinner . Before it gets dark . " She hung up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's gon na get me out here in the middle of nowhere , " Becca said as she pulled down a bridle . " It 's not like when we lived in California , you know , in the middle of civilization . " " Just be careful . " " Always am . " " Take Barkley with you . " " He 'll come whether I want him to or not , but he 's not much of a watchdog . " " Just take him . " " Fine . " ( Continues ... )
