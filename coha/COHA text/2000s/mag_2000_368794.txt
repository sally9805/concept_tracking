With our regular season half shot , football junkies , bloodlust barely sated , are already suffering proleptic pangs of withdrawal . And this year , cruelly , a false hope has been raised : the XFL . Right after the Super Bowl , Vince McMahon 's World Wrestling Federation , in alliance with NBC , will kick off its brand of super-smash-mouth football . Vince and the WWF 's think tank have come up with some rule changes to make the game more exciting , i.e. , more violent . There will be no fair catches . No touchbacks on the kickoff . No " in the grasp " rule to protect the quarterback . <P> Granted , the NFL has got pretty lame . But Vince ! No fair catches ? No touchbacks ? That 's it ? That 's what all the fuss is about ? We , as a television audience , have been weaned on Grand Guignol reality programming  --  standard fare like World 's Grimmest Third World Postcolonial Descents into Anarchy videos . We 're talking about entire families whiling the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidney transplants and sex-change operations . You want to give us more bang for the buck ( i.e. , more violence ) , you 're gon na have to do a lot better . How do you decrease the peace and infuse the sport with more savagery ? Here 's what I 'd do : <P> ASYMMETRY A league with basically equivalent teams  --  the " on any given Sunday " ethos  --  is all fine and good , but surely will not result in as much grievous mayhem as will matching a team of hardened professionals against a team of hapless amateurs . Pepper some of your rosters with nonpros  --  defrocked priests , cashiered New Jersey State Troopers , tubercular sculptors and the like . I 'd watch that ! <P> MORE STEROID RAGE Make the use of steroids and erythropoietin mandatory and enforce it ! Any athlete who tests negative for nandrolone or who has a **28;12309;TOOLONG ratio of under 6 to 1 ca n't compete . It 's that simple . Imagine players dumping a big cooler of human growth hormone on their coach after a victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no real equivalent of , say , Arsenal vs . Tottenham . We do n't sing sectarian anthems and fling pub darts at each other . This is bad for ratings . So instead of determining teams geographically ( New York , L.A. , Orlando ) , I suggest organizing teams along ethnic , religious , political and tribal lines . There should be a Bloods team . A Crips team . A Lubavitch Hasidim team . Aryan Nations , Khmer Rouge , Hutu , Tutsi , Royal Ulster Constabulary , Jews for Jesus , Hizballah . Now you 've got some fierce rivalries going  --  off the field and on . You try tackling a 275-lb. running back with 25 kg of Semtex plastic explosive packed into his shoulder pads ! <P> MORE PUNISHMENT Arm the officials with police batons and stun guns . If players violate the rules ( which should be as vague as possible ) , they should be handcuffed and forced into excruciatingly uncomfortable positions . To keep players on their toes , capriciously respond to trivial infractions ( like illegal motion ) with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF BOUNDS " The game itself is only a small part of The Game . If there 's spousal abuse ( surely a favorite avocation of today 's professional athlete ) , let 's see it ! That 's what the innovative kitchen-counter cam is there for . And replay those 911 calls from wives and girlfriends over the stadium 's loudspeakers during huddles .
