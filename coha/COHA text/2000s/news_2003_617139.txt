<p> A swath of Atlanta that 's straight out of " Gone With the Wind " may become the city 's next funky neighborhood . And with more than three square miles of land available for reuse , this one could be huge . <p> Atlanta 's original and still vibrant industrial corridor , on the west side , is just about the only place in the city left in which to attempt big mixed-use projects . Assembling large tracts elsewhere is too expensive a gamble for most developers . <p> Part of the area 's attraction may be its fabric of Atlanta history , which no one has gotten around to unraveling and repackaging . The crossroads where Atlanta was surrendered to the Yankees during the Civil War  --  the corner of Northside Drive and Marietta Street  --  is now a construction site for apartments . The windowless cooler of an old meatpacking plant is a condominium in a bustling building . Roads and train yards hum with never-ending freight traffic . <p> There 's a muscular attitude , with diesel to back it up . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of town he 's called home for all his 70 years . His mind 's eye recalls the factories and boardinghouses that sprang up along Atlanta 's first artery : the railroad . <p> " The old U-Haul place that 's condos now ? That used to be trailers full of pigs to be slaughtered , " Carmichael recalls . " The building across the street from here Alta West apartments , that was a meat house with a dairy . Just behind it is where they used to kill cows , used to shoot them in the back . " <p> Carmichael sweeps his hand over the western horizon across Howell Mill Road from Star Iron and Metal Co. , where he has worked for 26 years . Star is among the last five of 24 recyclers that have dotted the area in the past three decades . <p> " They want to call this West Midtown , or Midtown West , and we always called it just the west side , " Carmichael says . " But once they get the new bridge open over the Downtown Connector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way from Peachtree Street over here . " <p> The 17th Street bridge is best known as the portal from Midtown to Atlantic Station , now rising above the southwestern shoulder of the Brookwood Interchange . The 138-acre mixed-use project could not have gotten off the ground without a connection to the heart of Atlanta . The two communities were severed when the Downtown Connector was built in the 1960s . <p> An added benefit of the bridge was to be the potential reopening of the west side of Atlanta 's urban core . But until lately , there has been little evidence that would happen anytime soon . <p> Winter Co. now is poised to start the boldest mixed-use project yet in the industrial district . The company has long been a pioneer in redeveloping decayed parts of town that since have rebounded . But this is a 24-acre residential and retail project in a part of town that has n't seen new homes built in decades . <p> Next summer , Winter plans to open 183 townhouses and 10,000 square feet of retail space on the site of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tad lower than condos in Midtown , starting in the upper $100,000s and rising quickly above $250,000 . <p> The nearby freight yards of Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads spur heavy truck traffic , and nearby retailers cater to rougher elements of the warehouse crowd and perhaps residents of a few lonely apartment complexes aimed at local workers . <p> The closest current retail neighbor of the planned M West townhouse development is a triple-X-rated emporium . The closest grocery store is a convenience store . But Winter suspects that the environment bolsters the attraction of units priced for young professionals starting their careers . <p> " Obviously there 's some scruffy commercial , " says Carl Meinhardt , Winter 's vice president of design , who has worked in London , New York and Florence , Italy . " But that 's the new Atlanta . People are much more casual about their neighborhood and are willing to accept certain things . " <p> A seismic change <p> People have been accepting things in this industrial corridor since the end of the Civil War . And in this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former residential neighborhood that once had four churches , a health clinic and small shops . <p> Winter 's site is at the western tip of a historic black community called Blandtown . Bequeathed to a former slave who quickly lost it for not paying taxes , Blandtown grew after the Civil War as a housing development for blacks working in the freight yards and related industries . But the city of Atlanta caused a seismic change in the early 1950s , according to a book by Georgia Tech professor Larry Keating , " Race , Class and the Atlanta Housing Market . " <p> Atlanta annexed Blandtown in 1952 and in 1956 rezoned it from residential to heavy industrial , Keating writes . Georgia 's highway department soon classified Blandtown 's main streets as truck routes , sealing the end of the area 's housing era , Keating writes . <p> Railroads moved swiftly to expand in the area . Two of today 's biggest freight carriers opened yards there in 1957 : Norfolk Southern 's Inman Yard and CSX 's Tilford Yard . The two railroads now average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only city they serve where developers plan to flank their rail yards with mixed-use projects . The railroads say they can do little to accommodate such change . <p> " We want to be good neighbors , but people have to have certain expectations about us as good neighbors , " says CSX spokesman Gary Sease . " We sound train horns because it 's a safety requirement . Trains entering and departing rail yards are often moving very slowly , or engaged in switching , and blocked crossings are another community issue . " <p> Sease offers a bit of advice for those contemplating a move near a rail yard : " Be advised , we are a business trying to grow . Whatever number of trains we run on this line now , we hope to run more next year . " <p> Pioneers fret <p> Growth also is the goal of other businesses that have edged toward the rail yards over the past decade . But progress seemed hit or miss , partly because the industrial region is so expansive that it swallows whole developments like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a former factory district off Marietta Street that was retooled in the early 1990s into loft housing and offices . Likewise , the upscale Bacchanalia restaurant seemed a remote outpost when it moved to Howell Mill Road in 1999 . Not to mention housing developments on the other side of the rail yards : Steve Brock 's successful Adams Crossing and the Atlanta Housing Authority 's planned redevelopment of a demolished public housing project once called Perry Homes . <p> Now some of these pioneers fret that their eclectic neighborhood might be bowled over by the westward expansion of the central city . <p> Atlantic Station , the megadevelopment , is just the beginning . Along with improved access from Midtown because of the 17th Street bridge , Northside Drive is expected to see a surge of traffic from folks headed to huge residential and retail developments from Buckhead and from I-75 . A key intersection improvement will enhance access from Northside toward the industrial district . <p> The Georgia Aquarium , set to open in 2005 , is expected to attract 2.2 million visitors a year to its site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquarium is to be a new World of Coca-Cola , a museum that draws nearly a million visitors a year to its existing facility at Underground Atlanta . And once blighted neighborhoods flanking I-75 have seen rebirth . <p> " A huge , vibrant retail and residential district is emerging behind our back in what had been a no man 's land , " says Bill Gould , a pioneer developer of residential lofts on Means Street and longtime leader of a group that tries to unify the area , the Marietta Street Artery Association . <p> " Our community , on the other hand , is very much in flux and realistically in danger of serious damage and detriment due to the sizable projects on the ends of our community , " Gould says . " There 's no tangible evidence of any collaborative planning efforts . We have three or four major players , each with internal visions of expanding their needs . And there is very little interaction among those entities or between them and the existing community . " <p> ' It 's all upside ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traction . <p> A group of residents and businesses has been meeting for months to discuss shared concerns on the extreme northern boundary of the industrial corridor . The group hopes to ease traffic congestion along Howell Mill Road , just south of I-75 , and feeder streets that link to the warehouse district . The various streets carry 3,000 to 4,000 trucks per day , according to a study Atlanta completed in 2000 . <p> Pressure for a quick solution is rising in part because of a development at the corner of Howell Mill and I-75 . The former site of a one-time landmark hotel that had been taken over by prostitutes is slated to be built into a residential and retail community . <p> Atlanta officials have met several times with the group and hope to present recommendations early next year , says Bob Shelor , who oversees the city 's capital projects . <p> On the southern edge of the industrial district , the group of Marietta Street supporters is trying to create a vision for their area . They want to study the area and develop potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planning agency . <p> The effort is getting a push from the redevelopers of Puritan Mills . They are so bullish that they recently bought a warehouse , from Mead Corp. , that will be renovated into about 35,000 square feet of rental space . <p> " I think it 's all upside in this area , " says John Reagan of Urban Realty Partners . " Whether we can get everybody water and sewer could be a problem , depending on what happens at the city . But there 's no reason that if this region is planned correctly , and with the right sponsorship , we ca n't have tremendous population growth . And in urban redevelopment , commercial follows residential . " <p> That trend is prompting the owners of a warehouse to start considering other uses for a facility they had redeveloped into a center for data storage and disaster recovery . Rather than taking a loss on selling the building , MetroNexus is looking for ways to capitalize on the area 's renewal . <p> " We 'll continue to earmark a piece of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge amount of power and fiber , " says Alex Twining , president of MetroNexus.com . " That raises the question of what to do with the rest of the building . Clearly the King Plow Arts Center and Puritan Mills show a demand for office use . But this is a much bigger building . " <p> MetroNexus covers nearly 1 million square feet , more than three times the combined size of the other two facilities . The property abuts the former Mead warehouse , prompting some blue-sky thoughts by Twining about the possibilities of merging the sites . <p> " You can visualize a very different piece of earth in that location , not unlike an Atlantic Station type of development , " Twining says . " Big blocks like ours and Mead 's , eventually , will become the new urban town . That could mean putting a street grid back in and building a mix of residential and retail . " <p> Back at the recycling shop on Howell Mill Road , Melvin Carmichael is n't alone in marveling at the potential evolution of his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees it coming . <p> " Over the past five years people have run out of places in the city to develop , " Hammer says . " I 've been here 28 years , and I 'll stay as long as I can , because I consider my greatest accomplishment the jobs I 've created and the work ethic I 've instilled in my son . <p> " But I say ' Welcome aboard ' to all the new people .
