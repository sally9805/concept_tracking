In Max 's dream , Gabrielle still loves him . And she is still alive . They 're in the attic of the wood-frame house on Landry Street , making love on top of a decades-out-of-fashion gown that her mother had worn to some ball in her debutante days . Gabrielle had dragged it to the floor and positioned it carefully to avoid getting splinters from the old boards . Golden light streams in and makes her cinnamon Creole skin glisten , and Max 's heart catches in his throat as he moves inside her . She 's the kind of beautiful that clouds the minds of men , and makes even the most envious woman marvel . Yet she has a wild , desperate need in her eyes , as though a fire burns inside her and she believes he might be able to give her peace . <br> " Do n't ever stop , " she says , gazing up at him with copper eyes . <br> Stop what ? Making love to her ? Loving her ? He 's known her only a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to stop . The spell she has cast over him is irrevocable . He suspects that he has opened himself up to anguish , but he drives on with abandon . Better to have her and suffer forever if she should cast him aside , than to never have her at all . <br> Confusion touches him , makes him blink . This is n't how it was . The ball gown is right , all sequins and charm , and Gabrielle shudders with pleasure , her breath hitching , and that is very right , indeed . She wears a tight tank top with lace straps , her socks , and nothing else . So sweet , and only nineteen . . . but the wisdom and confidence , the sensuality in those eyes belong to a woman who truly understands the world . Gabrielle is the first woman , Eve ; the temptation for which Max is willing to risk his reputation and career . <br> But the light should n't be like this . It should be night , with the sounds of car engines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no sound at all , save for her heavy breathing . It 's like listening to a dead phone line  --  not just an absence of sound but a vacuum . <br> A heavy knocking comes from the door into the attic . Eyes glazed with love and lust , Gabrielle does n't hear it , but Max falters . <br> " No , no , baby , come on , " she urges , closing her eyes tightly . <br> The light has changed . Her skin has a bluish tint , but he blinks and it 's gone . <br> Her fingers twine in his hair and she pulls him down . He loses himself in the hunger of her kiss , but when they break apart the wrongness still troubles him . <br> The attic is too clean . <br> Gabrielle flips him over and settles down onto him , and he can feel the heat emanating from the place where they are joined , and the dark ringlets of her hair brush his face as she bends to kiss him again . Max rises to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attic is too clean , and the knowledge stabs him . This is a moment of magic for Max , like nothing that 's ever happened to him before , but Gabrielle keeps the attic of this old place clean , which makes him wonder how many men have been here before him , and how many felt the same way he does . <br> Floorboards creak , and the attic has changed . It 's impossibly huge . Posters hang on the walls  --  things he 'd had in his office at Tulane University  --  and in the shadows of the eaves , figures loom . Then , somehow , he can see through the shadows , and he knows these silent observers . He recognizes some of his colleagues and students ; Gabrielle 's cousin , Corinne , two men from Roland 's Garage , the bar on Proyas Street where she 'd taken him once and he 'd been the only white face in the place . They watch , but he feels no menace from them , only sadness , as if they 've come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max can not see its face , which is fine , because he does n't want to . He 's too afraid . <br> He focuses on Gabrielle , shutting them all out . He wants to give her all of him , to bring her joy , and he touches her face , thrusting up to meet her . <br> Only then does he feel the wetness beneath him . <br> Frantic , he glances around and sees water flowing up through the spaces between the floorboards . The arms of the ball gown float like butterfly wings . An old leather shoe drifts by his head . <br> He tries to ask where it 's all coming from , turning to look up at her . But when he opens his mouth , water spills in . The attic is flooding . Max is drowning . Panic surges through him for a moment , but up through the water he sees that Gabrielle is still rocking on top of him , smiling as she presses her hands down on his chest , holding him down , keeping him under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights her , but then his panic shatters , leaving only the debris of sadness . <br> The world inverts . <br> Gabrielle is still above him  --  he can see the beams of the attic roof , and he can still feel the floorboards beneath his back  --  but as though the house has turned upside down , she is now the one under the water . It fills the top of the attic and she begins to sink upward , arms still reaching for him as though beckoning him to follow . <br> She is wearing her mother 's old debutante gown now , and it billows around her . Then the roof tumbles away , down into a pit of nothing , and she slips into black waters and is gone . <br> And he wakes . . . <br> . . . with a deep breath , as though coming back to life . Max had a moment of dislocation , and then his seat jostled and the hum of the passenger jet 's engines filled his ears , and he remembered it all . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendering to consciousness . <br> The obese woman in the seat beside him shifted , absorbing even more of the space he 'd paid to occupy . It seemed she 'd actually gotten larger since the plane departed Boston , but of course that had to be impossible . <br> Do n't be a prick , he chided himself . Such thoughts were out of character for him on most days , but most days he was n't pinned into his seat by a woman of such immensity . Most days he was n't returning to a place he 'd sworn to leave forever , traveling to the funeral of the person responsible for both the greatest joy and the greatest pain he 'd ever known . <br> So if he behaved like a prick , he had a feeling he 'd be able to live with it . <br> The landing announcement came through the PA system . Max managed to get his seat upright . He rested his head against the window frame and stared down at civilization below . It should have been New Orleans , but ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city still presented complications and doubts . In the seven months he 'd lived in Louisiana , Max had never been to Baton Rouge , and as the plane descended over the state 's capital , he found himself wishing he could have avoided it forever . <br> Did I ever really know you ? he thought . And though the question was meant for Gabrielle , it could easily have applied to the city of New Orleans . He 'd barely scratched the surface during the nearly two semesters he 'd taught at Tulane , figuring he 'd have years to explore and understand the mystery of what had once been called the Big Easy . It had been a city of music and exoticism , a place of both excess and torpor . He thought he 'd gotten more intimate with New Orleans than the average tourist , but he 'd been fooling himself , like a john falling in love with his favorite hooker . <br> Such thoughts led to dark corners of his mind , and he forced himself to move away from them . Gabrielle had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , taking a new position teaching at Tufts University . But comparing her to some back alley whore made him cringe . She was n't entirely to blame . Yes , she 'd told him that she loved him , and pulled him into her life and her bed with a fervent passion he had never before encountered . But Max was thirty-one years old when he met Gabrielle , while she was only nineteen . He 'd been her professor . He 'd known the rules , and had broken them with abandon . <br> Yet despite the way everyone who discovered the relationship had seemed willing to give him a pass , Max blamed himself . He 'd looked into those bright copper eyes and seen the love she felt for him , believed it wholeheartedly . When Gabrielle had told him that she 'd dreamed of finding a man who would leave her breathless , and that she 'd found him in Max , he 'd believed her . When they 'd made love in the attic on Landry Street , and she 'd wept and clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where no one else could ever reach them , he had felt like the man all men wanted to be  --  the hero , the knight , the lover and champion . <br> What an asshole . <br> One thing he 'd learned in his time in Louisiana was that New Orleans was a city of masks . Everyone wore one , and not just for Mardi Gras . Only the desperately poor were what they seemed to be . Otherwise , how to explain the way the populace had so long ignored warnings of their beloved city 's vulnerability , or the libertine air of sexual and epicurean excess and music that fueled the tourist trade , while sixty percent of the city remained illiterate , and thousands lived in shotgun houses slapped together like papier-mGchT ? New Orleans had two faces : one of them a stew of cultures and languages , poverty and success , corruption and hope ; the other , the mask it showed the world . <br> How could he have been fool enough not to see that Gabrielle also wore a mask ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times while back in Boston . He ought to have been settling in , enjoying the preparations for his new job , and trying to move on . At his sister 's Fourth of July barbecue , he should have listened when she 'd told him her single neighbor , Jill , had taken an interest in him . But he 'd been too lost in that question to pay attention , beating himself up , wondering how he had fallen in love so fast and hard . Wondering how long it would be before it stopped hurting . <br> And then August had come , and with it , hurricane season . <br> Watching the television reports as Katrina moved into the Gulf of Mexico , he 'd wondered why no one seemed as terrified as they should have been . Were n't they watching the same reports down in Louisiana ? Could n't they see the monster about to make landfall ? But even as those questions rose in his mind , he understood . Some of the people in New Orleans would put their faith in God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to fate . If the storm was meant to take them , it would . And some would just be stubborn ; until someone called for a mandatory evacuation , they were n't going anywhere . And maybe not even then . Someone would have to round them up to get them out of there . <br> For too many , no one ever came . <br> Max had sat in his little faculty apartment on the Tufts campus and watched the anguished aftermath of the storm . <br> He had little faith in the spiritual , but Max had felt a soul-deep certainty , in those initial few days , that Gabrielle had not survived Hurricane Katrina . Days turned to weeks , shock turned to numbness , and numbness to mourning . Hurricane Rita arrived at the end of September , flooding parts of the city all over again . Chaos had still not released its hold on the Gulf Coast , and it seemed order might never be restored . <br> On the 18th of October , just over seven weeks after Katrina , Max 's phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the habit of holding his breath when he glanced at the caller ID window . That night , the readout had said unknown caller , but what struck him was the area code : 504 . Louisiana . <br> Max had picked up the phone . He 'd hated himself for the hope in his voice when he said , " Hello ? " <br> " It 's Corinne Doucette . " <br> And he 'd known . " She 's dead , is n't she ? " <br> For a moment , the line went silent . Then , just as he 'd begun to think they 'd been disconnected , Corinne spoke again . <br> " I told her to get out of there , but she would n't go . Said she could n't leave , that it was the only place she 'd be safe . They were saying all the neighborhoods in the bowl could be flooded , but she just went up into that damn attic and would n't come down . I told her she was crazy , Max , but you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corinne 's voice had broken then . <br> " The water got that high ? " he 'd asked . <br> " High enough . " <br> Max had listened to Corinne as she told him about evacuating to Houston , and how she 'd called and tried to get the police or someone , anyone , to go by and check the house on Landry Street . Most of her family had left New Orleans , and of those who planned to return , none of them wanted anything to do with Gabrielle , dead or alive . Except for Corinne , her family had written her off years before . <br> In late September , Corinne had reluctantly returned to New Orleans . And so she 'd had to identify the body . <br> At last , when Max had heard enough , he 'd finally spoken up . <br> " Why did you call me ? " <br> It had brought her up short . " What ? " <br> " After what happened . Why would you call me ? " <br> Her nerves had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of hurt and anger . " Jesus , Max . I called you because I thought you 'd want to know . Maybe she fucked with your head , but I figured you were the only one . . . " <br> Her words trailed off . <br> " The only one what ? " Max had to ask . <br> " The only person in the world besides me who would cry for her . " <br> Max had wanted to tell Corinne that he 'd done his share of crying for Gabrielle when she was alive . That it had n't helped then , and it would n't help now that she was dead . But he could n't get the words out . <br> Nearly three more weeks had passed , and now he found himself on this airplane , about to touch down in Baton Rouge . During the layover in Memphis , he 'd almost turned around and caught the next plane back north . At least , he 'd pretended to himself that he could do that . What a joke . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make the grief go away . Leaving the way he had , this chapter of his life had never felt closed . <br> Gabrielle 's funeral might finally put an end to it . <br> He 'd grieve , but he would not cry . Perhaps it was a good sign that he could n't shed any more tears for her . Or maybe it meant he was dead inside . <br> " I hate landings the most , " said the woman beside him . <br> Max blinked and looked at her . She 'd said nothing the entire flight , and now she wanted to strike up a conversation ? The cynicism that had been building in him all year began to form a reply , but then he looked at her , and he saw her . The woman had kind , intelligent eyes , and wore an expression of nervous self-deprecation . He wondered what brought her to Baton Rouge . There must , he knew , be other people on board who were coming to Louisiana for funerals or to rebuild . And some who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undiscovered in mud or in some other attic . <br> " Do n't worry , " Max told her , smiling . " This close to the ground , even if we fall the rest of the way , the worst we 're gon na get is bruises . " <br> She gripped the armrests and stared at him , wide-eyed . " Do n't even say that ! " <br> Then , with a squeak of tires , the plane found the runway . The woman let out a breath and chuckled . " Was that your attempt to set me at ease ? " <br> " I 'm afraid so . " <br> " You 're not very good at it . " <br> " Never have been , " he confessed . " But still I try . " <br> They shared a smile as the plane taxied toward the terminal . <br> " What brings you to Louisiana ? " she asked . <br> Max glanced out the window . " A woman . " <br> Corinne drove south on Interstate 10 with the windows down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corsica . Max did n't complain . The car had no air-conditioning , and the afternoon was warm and humid . Back home in Boston , November meant chilly days and chillier nights . But that Louisiana day , winter felt a whole world away . <br> " Thanks for coming to get me , " he said , fifteen minutes south of the airport . <br> " Not a problem . Guy like you , if you 'd gotten a rental , you 'd probably have been carjacked before you got anywhere near your hotel . " <br> Max stared at her , waiting for the smile . <br> It did n't come . <br> " You 're serious . " <br> Corinne kept both hands on the wheel and her eyes straight ahead . There 'd been precious little small talk at the airport , and even less since . <br> " We 're a little short on jokes down here , lately , " she said . " So yeah , I 'm serious . It 's rough . The city 's still reeling . " She trailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , so he gave her the silence in which to speak . After a pause , she did . " They 've got hundreds of dead folk in a warehouse over by the Superdome . Doing DNA tests , supposedly , trying to figure out who they all are . If I had n't laid claim to Gaby , she 'd probably still be over there . Maybe forever . French Quarter 's back up and running , other parts of the city , too . High ground . You 'll be fine in your hotel . But some areas , it 's still a war zone . Might as well be in Baghdad . A lot of the folks that left , maybe most of ' em , are n't ever coming back . Some places , it 's like the apocalypse came . There 's talk of rebuilding , but it 's never gon na happen . That 's the first sign of a crumbling empire , Max . Cities fall and nobody builds ' em up again . " <br> He kept staring at her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenly aware of his hands , as though he should be able to do something with them , maybe try to offer her comfort , or send up a prayer to God . But he barely knew Corinne , and he and God were strangers . <br> After a couple of minutes , the time when he should have said something in reply passed , so he stopped seeking the words . <br> Corinne and Gabrielle were cousins , Creole girls who 'd never be mistaken for white but whose skin forever marked them out among the black population of New Orleans . Max had never understood the politics of hue , and always feared expressing an opinion on the subject . He was white and from Boston , and he could n't claim to know a damn thing about New Orleans . So he kept his mouth shut . All he knew was that even before he 'd met Gabrielle he had thought a mixed race heritage produced the most beautiful children , and that there must be some lesson the world should learn from that . Meeting Gabrielle had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , Max saw some of that same beauty in Corinne . They 'd met half a dozen times when he 'd been involved with Gabrielle , but he 'd never really noticed her looks . She simply did n't have her cousin 's presence . Gabrielle had burned brightly ; Corinne had been in her shadow . But apparently it had n't stopped her from loving Gabrielle . <br> Abruptly , she turned and shot him a hard look . " Why do you keep staring at me like that ? " <br> " You look a little like her , " Max said . <br> " I 'm nothing like her ! " Corinne snapped , turning her gaze back to the road ahead . The hurt in her voice did n't surprise him , but the anger did . <br> " Are we really going to be the only people at the funeral ? " <br> Corinne softened . " Our family shut her out ; you know that . The ones who are still in the city , they live Uptown . When she was alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that she 's dead , they wo n't be going out of their way to say good-bye . Could be some of her friends 'll have heard and come along and surprise me , but I doubt it . Lots of people have been shipped out . Those who are still here are looking after themselves and their own . It 's all right , though . " <br> Max looked out the window , watching the side of the highway where wind-downed trees and abandoned cars remained , part of the debris left behind by the storm . <br> " Two people , " he said quietly . " How can that be all right ? " <br> " Ah , she would n't mind so much , " Corinne said . " She did n't have but the two of us who really loved her . We 'll be there . That 's as it should be . " <br> Max swallowed hard . His throat had gone dry . " I 'm not sure  --  " <br> " Do n't even start . She put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do n't try to tell me you stopped loving her because of it . I know better . " <br> Irritated , he narrowed his eyes and studied her . " You think so ? " <br> " You 're here , are n't you ? " <br> Max opened his mouth , but closed it again . The Doucette women had a habit of leaving him speechless . <br> b <br> The French Quarter of New Orleans had established a reputation around the world . Some of it had been born of fame , thanks to the Quarter 's unique architectural mTlange and the delights of its restaurants , and some had sprung from the infamy of Bourbon Street , where the drunkenness and breast-flashing of Mardi Gras had spilled into the other 364 days of the year . Max had never been interested in Bourbon Street . One walk along that road , with its faux-voodoo shops and tourist puke-fest bars , might have put him off of the city forever , if not for the rest of what the Quarter had to offer . The terraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the tiny restaurants with their succulent gumbos delighted him . <br> The Quarter had sustained hurricane damage . There were restaurants and bars that were still closed , some of them boarded up , and more than one shop stood empty and dark , the owners having given up on New Orleans forever . The wind and the rain had taken their toll , but the Quarter had n't flooded . When the city was ready to receive tourists again , Bourbon Street would be there . <br> For now , though , Max found it eerie as hell . Even in the rain , there had always been street performers here ; saxophone players and steel bands , dancers , mimes and jugglers . The afternoon he arrived , the sun was shining , but as he walked into his hotel the street outside was silent . New Orleans had lost its music . It might as well have lost its soul . <br> Next morning , Corinne picked him up and they drove out of the Quarter , following Esplanade up through Faubourg Marigny . Their route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floodwaters , and thus far he 'd not encountered the level of devastation he 'd seen in photographs and on television . He wondered if Corinne had been purposely sparing him that , or if she 'd just rather avoid it herself . <br> When they reached Holt Cemetery , however , there was no way to avoid the reality of what had transpired in the city . Max had driven past it before , had seen the rows of tilted crosses and slate-thin headstones , but he 'd never been inside the gates . In most of the Catholic world , All Saints ' Day just meant another trip to church . But in New Orleans , every first of November brought massive gatherings to the city 's cemeteries . People went there to decorate the graves of their loved ones , to leave flowers and notes and photographs , or just to remember . <br> As Corinne drove the car slowly along the narrow cemetery road , Max shuddered to think what November 1st had been like this year . Markers were down , and many were probably far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on brown , lifeless grass . <br> " The whole cemetery was flooded , " Corinne said . <br> Max did n't need telling . In his mind 's eye , he could see the crosses slowly being submerged as the water level rose . In some places the water had worn the topsoil away , and the upper edge of a coffin could be seen . If any bones had been brought to the surface by the flood , they 'd been removed or reburied . With so much of the city 's population driven from New Orleans , Holt Cemetery had probably been quiet on All Saints ' Day , but someone had been tending to the worst of it . Someone had hope . <br> " There are no aboveground crypts here , " he said , glancing around in surprise . <br> Corinne laughed . " Not everyone can afford to be buried in style , Max . Holt 's full of poor black folks . Some of the markers have lists of names on them , bones from half a dozen generations in a single grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> She put the car in park . <br> " Our grandparents and my father are buried in the family crypt in Mount Olivet Cemetery . I tried to get Gaby 's parents to let us put her there , but they refused , and they would n't give a dime for her burial . Even my mother would n't give me a dollar for Gabrielle 's coffin , and the girl had been her favorite once . Made her laugh more than I ever could . Gaby used to sleep over and we 'd do my momma 's hair . Now that she 's dead , everyone turned their backs on her . " <br> Her voice cracked , tears threatening . <br> " I do n't understand , " Max said . " When I was seeing her , I was aware of some rift , but she never talked about it . Now you tell me her family hated her so much they wo n't even come to see her laid to rest . But why ? " <br> For a second he thought she might tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes that made him think maybe he did n't want to know . Then the moment passed , and Corinne shook her head . <br> " It 's family business , Max . I start talking about family business , and when my time comes I 'll be buried out here with her . They 're already turning cold to me because I wo n't pretend Gaby never existed . I 'm just hoping once she 's in the ground , we can all put it behind us . " <br> " So you can forget her ? " <br> Corinne glared at him . " I wo n't ever forget her . But I want them to forget . It 's the only way they 'll forgive me . Now , come on . They 're waiting . " <br> She exited the car and started off across the ravaged cemetery , stepping over a warped , bloated wooden sign that had once marked a grave . Max watched her go , trying to ally the picture she was painting of Gabrielle with the girl he 'd known . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been spectacular , one of those people who seemed loved everywhere she went . <br> Maybe she never went anywhere she would n't be so well received . <br> There might be some truth to that . In the months he and Gabrielle had been together , the only member of her family she had introduced Max to had been Corinne . But he had never realized the full extent of the rift in the Doucette clan . Now that he did , he could n't help wondering not only what had caused it , but what it had cost Corinne to ignore it . <br> Max fixed his tie and adjusted the cuffs of his jacket . Even in November , he felt too warm in the charcoal suit he only ever wore at weddings and funerals . Perhaps the New Orleans weather was to blame , humid and warm today . Or maybe he just felt out of place here , the jilted ex , much too old for the dead girl to begin with . <br> The eight people standing by Gabrielle 's open grave watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments in quiet conversation with the priest , by which time Max had arrived at the graveside . From there he could see the other road through the cemetery and the two cars parked there , one of them a hearse . There had been no wake and no funeral mass . <br> No longer able to deny its presence , he at last focused on the coffin that sat on the ground beside the open grave . It was a simple metal box , but he suspected it was better than a lot of those interred at Holt would have had . He stared at it , tried to imagine that Gabrielle lay inside , and could not . <br> His throat closed up , emotion flooding him . Grief and anger mixed into some other , unnamed thing . Memories began to rise of their time together , making love in the attic room of that empty house , strolling the backstreets of the Quarter , drinking in bars in Marigny or listening to music in Bywater clubs . She 'd hated all the tourist spots except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gabrielle had joked . At least , he 'd always thought she was joking . She 'd make breakfast in the nude , but get shy if he walked into the bathroom while she was showering . She loved flowers that grew wild , but thought gardens pretentious . <br> How could anyone not have loved her ? <br> How could he ever stop ? <br> " Are you all right ? " Corinne asked . <br> Max flinched , looked at her , and then slowly nodded . " I will be . " <br> " You do n't look it . " <br> He smiled , keeping his voice to a whisper . His words were n't meant for other ears . " I thought I was being a fool , coming down here . What kind of guy travels this far for a girl who slept with someone else , you know ? But I 'm glad I came . " <br> Corinne touched his arm gently . " She was hard to understand . " <br> Max only nodded . That was the understatement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you said it 'd be just us . " <br> " Father Legohn 's congregation is mostly gone . The one with the nice shoes is the undertaker . The others are what 's left of the church , just here to help carry her , say a prayer , and put her in the ground . " <br> The truth of this hit Max hard . Despite the warning Corinne had given him , the idea that there was nobody left in New Orleans who cared enough to say good-bye to Gabrielle was bitter and ugly . It boded ill for the city , and spoke darkly of the dead girl . At least Gabrielle 's body had been identified , not left amongst the hundreds of corpses remaining unclaimed , identities unknown . <br> The priest took his place at the head of the grave , Bible clutched in his right hand . As he began to speak , Max leaned toward Corinne . <br> " At least she had you , " he whispered . " If you had n't paid for it , who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't pay for it , " Corinne said . " The storm left me with nothing . " <br> Max blinked , confused , listening to the priest with one ear as he tried to make sense of Corinne 's words . <br> " Then who did ? " <br> She gave the slightest nod toward the hearse . A third car had pulled up on that cemetery road , a little white two-door coupe that looked forty years old . The man who stood by the car must have been thirty years older , with hair as white as his car , and skin darker than his funeral suit . <br> " Who 's he ? " Max asked . <br> One of the congregation members hushed him . Corinne was focused on the priest and did n't answer . Max looked back across the cemetery to the old guy and his little white coupe and wondered why , if he 'd paid for the coffin and the grave , he did n't come and listen , and say good-bye . <br> But then Father Legohn began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Corinne  --  and he segued into talking about the days of loss they 'd all put behind them and the many more days that lay ahead . And Max let himself be seduced by the man 's eloquence and heart , and again slipped into the past , into his own memories of Gabrielle . <br> When the funeral ended , the undertaker and the handful of members of Father Legohn 's congregation accompanied the priest back to his car . Several men piled into the Lincoln with him and drove off , but others remained behind with the undertaker . They stood by the hearse and smoked , waiting for Max and Corinne to depart so they could put Gabrielle into the ground . One of them offered a cigarette to the old man by the white coupe , but he declined . <br> " I could use a drink , " Corinne said . " And nothing pleasant . No fucking margaritas for me . I want whiskey . " <br> Max looked at her . " I 'm with you . I 'd like to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " Take as long as you like . " Before leaving the graveside , she touched her fingers to her lips and then brushed them against the lid of Gabrielle 's coffin , a last kiss for a cousin who 'd been more like a sister . Then without glancing back at Max , she turned and walked back across the storm-and-flood-ravaged cemetery to her car . <br> Hands stuffed in his pockets , Max stared at the coffin . No headstone had been erected . From the look of Holt Cemetery , it seemed more likely Gabrielle would have some kind of marker set into the ground , and maybe that would be the best thing . If someone put up a cross or a stone , the next storm surge might just knock it down . And any fool could see there would be a next time . <br> " I hate you a little , " he whispered . " For what you did , and now for dying . " He chuckled softly , ashamed but unable to pretend he did n't feel these things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd hurt him , or how she really felt . He 'd never be able to confront her about it . <br> " Sometimes I wish I 'd never known you . " But he knew , even as the words came out , that they were a lie . What he wished was that he had never learned the truth . <br> A cough startled him . The polite , sorry-to-interrupt-you sort of cough . <br> He turned to see that without him hearing , the white-haired old man had come over to the graveside . Max stood at the head of the grave , where the priest had prayed a short time before , and now the old man stood at the foot , with that gaping hole between them and Gabrielle 's coffin off to one side . <br> " You 're Max Corbett , " the man said . His skin was so dark his hair looked like snow on top of tar . Of all the things Max might have expected to come out of his mouth , this was n't it . <br> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man nodded toward the coffin . " Girl was a friend of mine . Sweet thing , and gone too soon . " <br> Max nodded . Gabrielle was full of surprises . <br> " You have questions for her , " the old guy said . " Things you wanted to ask her . " <br> Uncomfortable , Max glanced at him . " Why ? Did she talk about me ? Give you a message or something ? " <br> " Some , but nothing like what you mean . " The old man touched the thin metal of the coffin , stared at it for a moment , then looked back up at Max . " I 'm just saying if you have questions you want to ask her , it might not be too late . " <br> Continues ...
