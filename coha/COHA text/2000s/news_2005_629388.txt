<p> GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK , ARIZONA - THE beauty of the Grand Canyon painfully will take your breath away . <p> Especially if your trail guide is Dr. Bill Kvien . <p> Correct that : if your guide is the masochistic Dr. Kvien . <p> Kvien works with my older brother , Craig Fujii , at the Indian Health Services in Winslow , Ariz . The Grand Canyon is their backyard and playground . <p> Every fall Kvien plans a backpacking trip into the national park . Last year , his route from the North Rim led his then 14-year-old son , Clay Kvien , and Craig to Phantom Ranch campground along the Colorado River . <p> Craig referred to it as harder than hell . " <p> Welcome to Kvien 's world . <p> Maintained trails allow civilized hiking from point A to B. But Kvien is an animal . His idea of backpacking involves bloodletting . You wo n't find his trips neatly dashed across a topo map . Fun for Kvien is following George Steck 's book Hiking Grand Canyon Loop Hikes I " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backpacking routes . <p> " The route is straight down the drainage through the brush to the big dropoff in the Supai , " Steck says . Supai is the 285-million-year-old layer of rock , made of shale and limestone and covered by sandstone , that is found in the western areas of the Grand Canyon . <p> When Kvien says backpacking , he really means bushwhacking , bouldering , climbing , sliding , scooting and traversing pools of red , stagnant water as well as fast-flowing creeks . <p> " This hike will be easier than last year 's , " Kvien told Craig . He was not to be believed . <p> The ease with which Kvien obtained the backcountry permit should have alarmed Craig . Instead , he dragged me into it . " This will be a trip of a lifetime , " he told me . <p> It 's a good thing it was . That means my life continues . <p> Preparing for adventure <p> We arrived at Swamp Point trailhead at night . We laid out our ground cloth , air mattresses and sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting star . <p> The sun was just under the jagged horizon to the east . But to the south , the Grand Canyon sank before us . Steamboat Mountain stood out as the most notable marker . Kvien pointed out the direction we would navigate . <p> After a quick breakfast of instant oatmeal and fresh fruit , we divided up food and crew gear ( equipment for the three of us , like the camping stove , pots , water filter ) , locked up the car and began our adventure . <p> We started on the North Bass Trail , a steep switchback that descends toward Mauv Saddle . We stopped at a small wooden cabin used by the Forest Service and hikers for shelter . Inside , three cots without coverings and a table with a sign-in sheet awaited . <p> Out the cabin door , we turned left while the North Bass Trail continued to the right . Kvien spied the wash-out path , hardly noticeable , and into the trees we went . <p> Kvien led with me behind him and Craig at the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicket was not . We bushwhacked for four hours solid and somehow wandered out of the gully . This made the going a bit more challenging . The brush got thicker . The slope got steeper . <p> We finally made it to a dry waterfall that Kvien recognized . But it was too high to scramble . I dropped my pack and found the semblance of a trail . When I cleared a small hump , I found a cairn , or stone marker , that led me around and down through another wash-out . Another cairn . Good sign . I signaled for my brother and Kvien to head to the left . <p> We stopped here after five hours of hiking and had lunch : pita bread , hummus and Edam cheese . This meal remained a constant through our four-day trek . <p> From here , the trail opened up . The path followed the dry wash-out for the most part and was punctuated by large boulders to scramble around . <p> Seeking the slicky slide <p> Soon enough we entered the Narrows , a canyon with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the day , we were going to be wet . <p> " The slicky slide . The slicky slide , " Kvien muttered like a madman . " This is it , I know it , " he droaned as we dropped down a smooth rock chute into water . " No , maybe it 's the next one . " <p> I began to loose count of how many times we took off our packs , slid them down to Kvien and slid ourselves into the water . I did n't pack water shoes on this trip , cutting down on weight . So I just doused my Gore-Tex XCR hiking boots . They 're waterproof until the water gets higher than the boot . Then they become little swimming pools . " Squish , squish , squish , " they replied with each step . <p> When we finally got to a WaterWorld-size slide , we realized this was the elusive " slicky slide . " It was a double drop . The first was fairly short and with a shallow-water landing . We slid down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool . <p> Kvien , the tallest , went first . He dropped down the wet limestone like a kid at recess . We dropped our packs down to him and he ferried them to dry land . We followed . <p> As I waded through the water , I wondered how we were going to climb back up the slicky slide . Many hikers have done it , Kvien included . But retracing these steps was not an attractive offer . <p> Unexpected dilemma <p> Kvien 's original itinerary was to hike down to Tapeats Amphitheater and then retrace our steps back to the car at the Swamp Point trailhead . But after the bushwhacking , the slicky slide , scrambling down the loose rocks of the scree and talus and maneuvering around humongous boulders , the Fujii brothers revolted . <p> With good reason . Craig 's legs were shot . They shook with exhaustion and sometimes hyper-extended . This made the hike down more difficult . <p> The smile on my face had disappeared . But Kvien reassured us that we were getting close to our first camping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledge with a 200-foot drop and then some scree to go down , " he said , looking to Craig , " And you 're not going to like it . " <p> We traversed across , up and down a steep grade with more rocks , cactus and brush until we came to an opening overlooking the canyon . A narrow ledge jutted from the redstone wall . Kvien and I advanced onto the ledge , touching the wall for balance . I glanced down into the steep canyon below . Once Kvien and I had made it safely across the ledge , I looked back to check on Craig . He was leaning against the wall . " That 's a long way down , " he said . <p> Kvien descended the 45-60 degree rocky talus slope , interrupted only by trees and brush . We gave chase . A slow and painful chase . In some places , Craig slid on his butt , using his feet to brake . <p> At the base of the slope , we reached a fairly wide rocky creek bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kvien asked . I listened but could only hear my heart trying to break free of my chest . " Water , " he said , answering his own question . <p> Finally , a campsite <p> After 11 hours of hiking , we arrived at our first campsite in Stina Canyon . A fresh cold creek flowed nearby . We walked into a small meadow and around a boulder searching for a nice flat spot . <p> We dropped our packs , unfolded our Therm-a-Rest inflatable chairs , shed our wet boots , socks and clothes and lowered ourselves slowly to the ground . The sky turned a deep azure , the light in the canyon gray and dull . While I mixed cocktails of filtered stream water and powdered Gatorade , Kvien boiled a pot of water and added two bags of dehydrated pasta , beef and spices . <p> We stirred and mixed while Craig fell asleep in his chair . When he awoke , we topped off our tanks . A dehydrated dessert of blueberry cobbler was in the mix . We licked our bowls clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the map came out . Kvien looked for an alternate route to get us out of the Outback , as Steck calls it . Our second night 's planned campsite would be at Upper Tapeats Campground on the Thunder River Trail . " Best of all , " Kvien said , " there 's a self-composting toilet . " <p> I did n't have to wait for a falling star to fall asleep . Lying on my back , with the redwall to the left and the Supai looming on the right , the stars shone so brightly in a moonless sky that they danced on their own . <p> Going the distance <p> Day 2 's challenge did n't involve the descent , but the distance . The hike followed the dry wash from Stina Canyon to Tapeats Creek , and Kvien 's only course of torture for the day was a few tough climbs down large dry falls . <p> After one drop , we stopped to refuel . I heard a buzzing sound behind me and swatted a bit . Buzz . Swat . Nothing . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a web . A black widow spider was hiding in the shade waiting for me to get out of her way so she could get on with her work.We all watched the entertainment as she spun more webbing around the pest and dragged it up toward her shady spot . <p> Craig sat with his arms crossed and eyes closed . He seemed like he would rather be that fly . Somewhere along the trek , he had picked up an intestinal irritant . But he trooped on , and the former photojournalist even managed to take pictures . <p> We entered a small slot canyon with a stream and cottonwood trees offering shade . Kvien jumped into the water to rinse off under the small waterfall . Craig took off his shirt , too , and jumped in . I climbed up to the top of the falls and dunked my head in the cool water . <p> The guys told me to jump in . I whined about getting my feet wet . " I do n't wan na get my feet wet " my brother imitated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks , pants legs and shirt . In I went . I hate when my big brother is right . It was refreshing . <p> We sat on the rocks to dry out . It does n't take long in the arid climate . I re-applied moleskin to a couple of hot spots on my toes , and off we went . <p> A welcome break <p> Tapeats Creek was a welcome respite after the long walk into the canyon and the heat of direct sun . The water was clear , cold and flowing rapidly . The trail crossed the creek repeatedly . <p> The only evidence that other modern-day humans had blazed this trail before us were footprints in the sand . As the creek began to widen , we had our first human sighting in the Grand Canyon . A male and female of the species were resting on a large flat rock . Another , most likely the alpha male , walked toward the creek . He spoke . " We crossed the water up there , " he said , pointing upstream . <p> They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched their journey from Monument Point . They planned on being in the backcountry for the rest of the week . <p> We had decided to hike to the Monument Point trailhead and find a ride to the car at Swamp Point , rather than retrace our steps . The hikers had noticed several cars at the trailhead . Hitching a ride would probably be easy , they said . <p> Armed with that advice , we settled a bit . Our main concern about reaching Monument Point was water . There is no reliable source on the North Rim . If we reached the trailhead , and no one hiked out on the same day , we 'd only have the water we carried from Thunder River . So , we planned to carry enough water to last two days and nights . <p> When we entered Upper Tapeats Campground , the self-composting toilet stood out like McDonald 's on a stretch of desert highway . Craig and I high-fived . While Kvien cooked and I filtered water , Craig , still not well , crashed out on his sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the Colorado River . I slept on a sloping flat rock in my cotton sleeping-bag liner . Shooting stars blipped like fireflies . <p> A beautiful reward <p> We awoke early to beat the sun . We carried enough water for a couple of hours . " Thunder River is the shortest river in North America , " Craig said . " It 's only a half-mile long . " <p> Great . A short half-mile walk up 800 feet . Is that possible without a ladder ? Sure , if you throw in a bunch of switchbacks that even Yao Ming could n't reach in a step . <p> But here , I finally found the beauty of the Grand Canyon . With Tapeats Amphitheatre and Terrace falling away , Surprise Valley to the west and trees sprouting from the walls over Thunder River , the beauty in the contrast hit me . " Wow , " I thought , looking through sweat-covered sunglasses . <p> We reached Thunder River just under the source . We drank straight from Mother Nature . The taste was pure . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and Gatorade and decided to stay in the shade of the cottonwoods until late afternoon when we might catch a break from the sun . He admitted later that he thought he would have to be helicoptered out . <p> Kvien and I unpacked everything in all three packs . We decided to heave the heaviest gear and give Craig my small backpack with clothes and sleeping bags . He would carry his own drinking water , but the two of us would carry two days worth of drinking and cooking water . <p> At the start of our adventure , my pack weighed 30 pounds without water . Now , I had 70 pounds on my back . But Kvien shouldered at least 10 pounds more than me as we walked out of the protection of Thunder River Springs , and we zig-zagged up the Supai canyon wall to Surprise Valley . <p> Hope for survival <p> We came across a hiker caching water and only exchanged greetings . But then we met two folks who offered us hope . They had left their companions at the Esplanade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an upper-respiratory infection , and they were probably going to hike back out the next day . They said they could give us a lift to our car . <p> From the relatively flat valley , we had to climb switchbacks for another 700 feet to the false rim . Atop this is the Esplanade . Here we paused for a group photo overlooking Surprise Valley . " It 's much prettier from far away , " Craig observed . <p> The Esplanade spread out before us . We found a flat area for the night . Craig fell asleep without eating a bite . Kvien and I split enough food for four people . <p> The wind whipped up as night fell . The temperature was a drastic change from the previous evening . The clouds rolled in , and I thought we were going to get wet . There was no place to stake out the tent . But it was our last night on the trail , so if we got wet there would n't be multiple days of suffering . <p> A beautiful sunrise warmed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't cook us today . But the climb and the altitude would . <p> I did n't realize how difficult the day had been until I got home - neither my brother nor I took any pictures during the last day 's hike . <p> The group with the ill hiker came out shortly after us . And , as promised , they gave us a lift all the way to Swamp Point . It was an hour 's drive from Monument Point . They went two hours out of their way to help us - and would n't take a cent for gas . <p> Truth be told , we could n't pay them what it was worth to save our skins . <p> ... <p> PLANNING A TRIP <p> Eager to undertake the challenge of an off-trail hike in Grand Canyon National Park ? Here are some suggestions : <p> When to go : The best time to hike from the North Rim to the Inner Gorge is October . Before that it 's too hot . Later , roads are closed because of snow . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter ; temperatures are bearable in the Inner Gorge and very cool to cold on the South Rim . <p> Getting in shape : Be in very good physical condition . Workouts should include aerobic and strength training . The best preparation in Houston for such a strenuous hike is to climb and descend the Rice University Stadium stairs . Gradually increase the weight of the backpack ( the one you will use ) with weights or jugs of water . Wear the boots you are planning on taking to break them in and make sure they are properly fitted . <p> Why the north : The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is less visited than the South Rim . Here you 'll find solitude . <p> Resource : " Hiking Grand Canyon Loop Hikes I " ( Chockstone Press , $10 ) , by George Streck , outlines off-trail backpacking routes . <p> More information : A Google search turns up more than 20 million references to the Grand Canyon .
