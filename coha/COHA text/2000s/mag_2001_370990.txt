At last year 's Millrose Games  --  the oldest and most prestigious track meet in the country  --  track veterans were stunned when organizers unceremoniously bumped the men 's pole vault from its traditional spot in prime time and replaced it with track and field 's hottest event : the women 's pole vault . <P> Women do the pole vault ? Yes indeed . And an American cowgirl turned vaulter , Stacy Dragila , 30 , does it better than anyone ever thought a woman could . The California native has owned the event since it became internationally accepted , including taking the first-ever women 's pole vault gold medal at the Olympic Games in Sydney last September and capturing her second World Championship three weeks ago in Edmonton , Canada . <P> Dragila and her international rivals , such as Russia 's Svetlana Feofanova and Australia 's Tatiana Grigorieva , have brought unprecedented attention to the competition . The pole vault combines speed , strength and the very real threat of serious injury , and fans have proved eager to see women compete . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really captured the public 's imagination , " says Garry Hill , editor of Track &; Field News . " It has livened up track and field . " <P> Part of the motivation for Dragila , who has competed in everything from rodeo riding to gymnastics , is the perception that women ca n't manage such a challenging competition . " People were saying women should n't even try this event , " says Dragila , who is an assistant track coach at Idaho State University . " These days we 're still breaking barriers . " Dragila has done her part : this spring she broke her own world record with a vault of 15 ft. 9 1/4 in . <P> Two years ago , the National Collegiate Athletic Association officially recognized the women 's vault , and at last count 38 states sanctioned it at high school championships . The success of Stacy Dragila may have moved her event into prime time for a long time to come . <P>  --  By Sally B. Donnelly              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
