fitness &; training THE READER Codey Fredenhagen , 31 Business analyst Aurora , CO THE PROBLEM " When my 8-year-old son asked what I want to be when I grow up I said , ' A bike racer . ' I 've been riding avidly for several years , ride 3-4 days a week ( 30 miles a day ) , and usually pull a century on the weekend . I love riding with my club , but I 'm too competitive to hang back with them . Whenever I see other cyclists up the road , I go hard to catch-and beat-them . I need to compete , but I 've never raced . What do I need to take the plunge ? " THE COACH Steve Madden , president of Performance Sports , a coaching company in Grass Valley , CA , has guided riders to state , national and world championships for road , track , XC mountain bike and X-Terra triathlon . He 's been a development coach and manager for the US Cycling Team since ' 95 . " Codey 's story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger challenge-he just needs to be more specific with training . With better quality , he can cut back on the miles and have more time with his family . " Want to train with Madden ?

Take it-even if you do n't feel you need it . TUESDAY COMMUTING W/INTERVALS ( 1 HOUR ) Integrate some aerobic power and muscular endurance work in the form of tempo or sub-threshold intervals  --  into your ride home . The rest of the ride should have a ceiling HR of 85% of MAC heart rate . Do ONE of these interval drills : * 1x30-45 minute Tempo interval @ 90% of MAC heart rate , 70-75 rpm . ( Tempo is uninterrupted , steady effort at low rpm and sub-threshold intensity designed to build muscular endurance and aerobic efficiency . Try a 53x15 gear at 70-75 rpm and adjust the gearing as needed for HR. ) * 2x15 min . LT intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between , 90+ rpm . ( LT intervals are slightly higher intensity using similar gearing as tempo but a higher cadence-85-90 rpm-to achieve the prescribed HR . ) WEDNESDAY ACTIVE RECOVERY ( 30-40 MINUTES ) Take a short spin , 30-40 minutes in small gears and a light touch on the pedals . Just spin and loosen the legs and relax . No commute-drive to work and ride at lunch . THURSDAY COMMUTING W/INTERVALS ( 1+ HOUR ) Integrate some shorter , high-intensity efforts like anaerobic power intervals or short power climbing repeats into your ride home . This workout complements the aerobic development by introducing higher intensity and repeatability into the training . Do ONE of these : * - 4x2- 3 min. sub-maximal efforts ( up to 110% of MAC heart rate ) , gearing similar to LT intervals but higher cadence ( 95-110 rpm ) w/5 min. rest between * 43 min. power climb repeats @ 100% of MAC heart rate , moderate grade , seated or standing , brisk cadence ( 70-80 rpm ) , 5-6 min. rest between FRIDAY PRE-RACE SPIN ( 1 HOUR ) Moderate-pace riding with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow the pipes out . Do n't worry about a set structure-just get out , rev up the engine and loosen up the legs . SATURDAY RACE OR LONG RIDE ( 3 HOURS ) Weekends are for racing or long endurance training rides that include competition-level work in the form of Tempo and LT intervals . The idea is to simulate a race situation on the ride . Keep the weekend rides at 125% of the average distance of your road races ( likely about 3 hours ) and increase the intensity-not the distance  --  of the training . SUNDAY RECOVERY/ENDURANCE ( 1-2 HOURS ) Get out for a spin of no longer than 2 hours . Keep a ceiling of 95% of MAC heart rate and do whatever you want during the ride . COACH 'S NOTES * The basic format is simple . Go hard , fast and long once each week to cover all the bases and let racing or fast group rides fill in the gaps . If you make it more complicated , you 're thinking too much . The standard periodization model would have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 5 days to recharge for the next three weeks of intensity . The rest time is vital to your adaptation and progress . Your first goal should be to be comfortable and finishing with the pack . Pay less attention to results and focus on developing fitness and improving skills . Road races and time trials are great for conditioning , and they 're big confidence-builders. * A consistent schedule gives you consistent progress through the season . Just 2 or 3 days of structured training in the 7-day training cycle is plenty and leaves room for endurance training and recovery . Racing or hard group rides provide a lot of the high-intensity training stress and offer a chance to test fitness . Active recovery is an important part of training that can be accomplished by riding easy on your commute days . WHAT 'S MAC HEART RATE ? The traditional " personal lactate threshold " most plans are based on corresponds closely to what I call your maximal aerobic capacity ( MAC ) heart rate-the highest average HR for an effort lasting about 20 minutes . An 8-mile time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAC . Ride at the highest effort you can maintain for the entire distance the average HR gives you a baseline for your training intensities . Perform the test every 6 to 7 weeks to measure progress , TRAIN WITH BICYCLING ! Mimic Codey 's program and you 'll build fitness for racing  --  for free .
