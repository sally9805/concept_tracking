<p> The show is back , complete with a soundtrack everybody can enjoy . <p> Last week before the Nets-Sixers game at Continental Arena , Vince Carter warmed up with a few trick shots , bouncing a ball from halfcourt into the basket and floating the ball 10 times into the basket from behind the backboard . He then sank a dozen consecutive 3-pointers , the shots falling in hypnotic rhythm to the squeals of early-arriving fans who , still not satisfied , begged him to dunk . <p> When he was with the Raptors earlier this season , before the N.B.A. barred the practice , he wore his iPod during pregame warm-ups , trying to escape into himself . <p> Since joining the Nets from Toronto on Dec. 17 in a trade that is looking more lopsided than ever , Carter has played as if he were liberated from basketball exile . <p> A 6-foot-6 swingman , Carter has been dancing in the layup line , swaying to the music blasting over the arena speakers . But that has only been his warm-up act . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored more than 40 points in three of his last four games . His controversial ejection from Friday night 's loss to San Antonio stopped what might have been a record barrage . <p> Throughout his enigmatic seven-year career , Carter has often made the seemingly impossible look easy on the court . But as much as he loves to perform , he is one celebrity who does not want to be a superstar . <p> " I like being a normal person , " Carter said Wednesday after the Nets ' 104-103 loss to the Lakers . " I enjoy playing basketball , just bringing the energy and being another guy . If I have to play like a superstar , I 'll do it . I do n't care . " <p> That is Carter 's mission statement , the mixed blessing and burden of his career . <p> " I think that 's who he is , " said Antawn Jamison , his brother-in-law and former teammate at the University of North Carolina . Jamison , who now plays for the Washington Wizards , has been honest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he gets a lot of notoriety and exposure , he just loves to play the game , " Jamison said . " He 'll give you a pose every now and then . But at Carolina , he did n't care about the attention . He just wanted to win . <p> " In Toronto , all of a sudden , when you 're getting the big contract and expected to be the man , you 're losing , it 's all on you . " <p> " Let 's be real , " Jamison added . " It comes with the territory . I thought Vince handled it well , but toward the end , it backfired a little bit . " <p> In his first two seasons , Carter was dubbed Air Canada and Half-Man , Half-Amazing , and he was fitted for Michael Jordan 's mantle . But the comparisons began to disappear in his last four full seasons with Toronto . A string of injuries caused him to miss 77 games , including 61 in the 2001-2 and 2002-3 seasons . He seemed to lack a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half-Man , Half-a-Season ; and Wince . <p> He requested a trade from the Raptors last summer , frustrated with the direction of the team and with the organization 's halfhearted efforts to interview Julius Erving for its general manager position . <p> When the season started , Raptors fans greeted him with boos . Once with the Nets , he admitted to John Thompson on TNT that he did not always work his hardest in Toronto . <p> Raptors General Manager Rob Babcock said : " When you come out and make a statement that you want to be traded , you become a distraction . No one likes to be booed , and his teammates know he wants to be traded . It just was n't working . He had career lows in everything . " <p> Carter embraced the trade to the Nets . " This is just a chance to start over and be who I am , " he said last week . <p> Who is he , exactly ? Carter , who turned 28 last month , is a devoted son , a quiet homebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear him talk , a $13-million-a-year sidekick . Jason Kidd is still the Nets ' franchise player . <p> " I know it 's his team and he 's going to need help with it , " Carter said . " In the beginning , with the controversy about whose team it was , I was like : ' I 'm here to help him . This is his team , he 's the captain and I do n't have a problem with it . " ' <p> Carter 's career has flourished when he has had coaches and teammates  --  like Charles Oakley and Kidd  --  who push him to drive aggressively to the basket , to work hard and to play consistently . <p> " We 'd tell him , ' You 're the man , ' but he did n't want to accept the role , " said Oakley , a teammate from 1998 to 2001 . " We had it out several times . " <p> He reminded Carter that a " leader is a guy who leads every day . " <p> From the minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow Kidd 's example . <p> The Nets ' president , Rod Thorn said , " When you play with Jason , you have to be tough ; you got to play with intensity because he wo n't accept anything less . " <p> Kidd said : " I do n't know how much I 'm the influence . I think he 's always played hard , but not maybe played at a high level consistently . When you have purpose , you tend to look at things a little bit differently . " <p> At the end of his time in Toronto , Carter , lacking confidence and hampered by a strained Achilles ' tendon , did not seem to want to lift even his eyes . The Raptors ' first-year coach , Sam Mitchell , benched him in fourth quarters . <p> " Sometimes I just felt like I was on an island by myself , " Carter said . " I did n't feel like I had any support , other than from my family . " <p> His mother , Michelle , his confidante and protector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and the team , but people did n't want to see that , " she said . <p> His wife , Ellen  --  who is expecting their first child , a daughter , in May  --  shook her head . " When somebody is very unhappy , it makes life miserable , " she said last week . " He 'd say : ' I do n't want to go to work today . Do I have to ? ' Now it 's like , ' Love you , bye ! ' and he 's gone . " <p> With the Nets , Carter is averaging 26.3 points , his highest since he averaged 27.6 in the 2000-1 season , when he took the Raptors to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals . <p> Filling a void left by Kenyon Martin , Carter has brought flair , though none of Martin 's defensive edge . Playing on without Richard Jefferson , who is expected to miss the rest of the season after surgery to repair torn ligaments in his left wrist last month , Carter and Kidd have combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He does n't have the pressure of having to be the franchise , and he wants to be there , " Babcock said . " I knew he would play well . But we could n't make a decision based off what he was going to do . " <p> Carter and Kidd are thriving in a two-man game . <p> " He tees the ball up , I get wide-open looks , " said Kidd , who has shot 50.8 percent from 3-point range in the last nine games . In that span , Carter has averaged 6.2 assists . <p> Nets Coach Lawrence Frank said : " You just do n't appreciate what he can do until you see him . I did n't know he was nearly as good a passer as he is . He 's got vision that not many people have . " <p> His teammates delight in the 360-degree dunks and circus shots he performs in practice .

Nets ticket sales are up 30 percent since Carter 's arrival , team officials said . <p> Still , Carter 's team achievements are few . His Olympic gold medal from the Sydney Games in 2000 may be the highlight . Critics wonder about his ability to help win an N.B.A. title . He acknowledged the divide between image and substance . Perhaps that is why he said he was through with the dunk contest , even if that was what made him famous . <p> " Yeah , exactly , " Carter said , rolling his eyes . " That gave me the opportunity . Now I want to get to the playoffs and show what I can do . " <p> The Raptors may be watching , but Carter said he would be focusing on a new audience . <p> " I 'm glad I could come here and make a difference , " Carter said .
