<p> Kurt Vonnegut , the " Slaughterhouse-Five " author who spun a horrific event during World War II into an anti-war novel that rallied the Vietnam War generation , was an icon of the counterculture and the political left for almost 40 years . Long before it was fashionable , he worried that human beings were killing the Earth . <p> In his later decades , Vonnegut , who died Wednesday after suffering brain injuries resulting from a fall at his Manhattan home weeks ago , cultivated a curmudgeonly aura and frequently said that he had " given up " on humanity . In his Long Island farmhouse , however , he hung a sign that read : " G  --  damn it , you got to be kind , " which does n't sound like someone who 's given up . <p> He became famous as much for being Kurt Vonnegut  --  outrageous , pithy , wise  --  as for anything he had written . Novelist John Irving compared him to Mark Twain . Jay McInerney called him " a moralist with a whoopee cushion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Socialism is no more an evil word than Christianity , " he wrote in " A Man Without a Country , " his 2005 memoir . " Christianity and socialism alike , in fact , prescribe a society dedicated to the proposition that all men , women and children are created equal and shall not starve . " <p> Vonnegut was born Nov. 11 , 1922 , in Indianapolis . He was editor of his high school paper , and when he attended Cornell University , he was an editor and columnist on the student newspaper there . In 1943 , he enlisted in the Army to fight in World War II . <p> The event that would change Vonnegut 's life occurred Feb. 13 , 1945  --  the Allied firebombing of Dresden . Vonnegut had been taken prisoner by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and was sent to the German city of Dresden . He and other prisoners hid in an underground meat locker during the night , as Allied planes nearly obliterated the city . An estimated 135,000 people died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After the war , Vonnegut got a job writing public relations releases for General Electric Research Laboratories . He wrote short stories and science fiction in his spare time . <p> " I was a hack . I 'd write anything to make money , " he wrote in " A Man Without a Country . " <p> He began to earn a modest living off short stories , but it was his first novel , 1952 's " Player Piano , " that finally got him recognized when it was made a selection of the Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club . It depicted a future in which technology overrides humanity . <p> Vonnegut 's reputation as a bold , quirky science fiction writer began to grow during the ' 60s , even though he was still far from well-known . Books like " The Sirens of Titan " that had first been published in paperback were reissued in hardback and translated into other languages .

" <p> By 1967 he had a three-book contract and a Guggenheim grant that allowed him to return to Dresden to research what would become " Slaughterhouse-Five . " <p> The book came out in 1969 and quickly went to No. 1 on the New York Times ' best-seller list . Parts of the novel were science fiction , with a protagonist named Billy Pilgrim , who becomes " unstuck in time " and visits the planet Tralfamadore . But it was the passages about the horrors of Dresden , at a time when many were turning against U.S. involvement in Vietnam , that were crucial to the book 's success . <p> The loose structure was held together by the frequent repetition of the phrase " So it goes , " which Vonnegut used repeatedly after scenes involving death . It became a sort of cosmic joke , a way to accept things that can not be understood . " So it is still going , " he seemed to be saying . <p> Vonnegut was embraced by the literary establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recipient of honorary degrees . But many critics were not nearly as positive about his post- " Slaughterhouse " output . " Breakfast of Champions , " " Slapstick " and " Jailbird " sold well , but some charged that what had seemed like an engaging stylistic simplicity in earlier novels had become a simplicity of ideas . <p> Still , he continued to write and publish , and to be sought after as a public speaker , particularly on campuses . As Twain developed a reputation for wonderful , rambling speeches later in his life , so did Vonnegut . His speeches had titles like " How to Get a Job Like Mine " and were usually not remotely related to that topic , concentrating more on current events and musings . <p> He never , however , delivered a commencement address that opened " Wear sunscreen " and continued with advice like " Keep your old love letters . Throw out your old bank statements .

The ironic remark , he wrote , " rolled them in the aisles . " <p> Vonnegut continued : " If I should ever die , God forbid , I hope you will say , ' Kurt is up in heaven now .
