Though we may see ourselves in scripture 's moral cowards , we have a second chance . Photograph // THE MAN IN THE DIRTY CLOTHES HAD BEEN trailing me for half a block . It was after dark , and even though I knew these streets pretty well , I was uncomfortable being followed so closely . Nine times out of 10 in situations like these , my feelings amount to pure paranoia . People in dirty clothes generally want no more than a little spare change from a passerby . I am in the privileged position of always having change to spare . It 's a match made in heaven , one could say . Folks like me and folks like him , we belong together . But being a woman complicates the matter a little . No matter how familiar or well-lit the streets may be , a woman followed by an unknown man is a formula for tension , if not trouble . It 's not a question of being brave , but of being safe . I 've made it a rule that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No exceptions , even for folks with broken legs or starving animals . That 's why God made the police force and why taxpayers like me keep them in uniform . Or so I told myself as I walked faster , feeling vaguely like the Levite in the parable who passed up a wounded man in a ditch . I 'm a better Samaritan in the middle of the afternoon , I mentally argued , but do n't ask for my help after sundown . I 've got rights , and my right to be safe is just as real as your right to be helped . All the while , I was sincerely hoping his leg was not broken and his dog was not starving , but I was not about to turn around to find out . Finally , realizing I was ignoring him and that I meant to continue ignoring him , the man raised his voice and spoke to my retreating back . " For the love of Jesus , " he said softly . I quickened my pace and disappeared around the corner , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged into my back , and though my intent was to be safe , I was never more at risk than then , as I eluded this stranger altogether . For the love of Jesus , was all he said . A simple plea for Christian compassion-and I said no . Not even for the love of Jesus will I stop for you . The horror of that choice is with me still . So I know a little of what Saint Peter experienced in the chilling moment when he denied his Lord . Of course , Jesus warned that it was coming , and Peter refused to consider himself capable of such ignominy . " Though all may have their faith in you shaken , mine will never be ! " he assures Jesus . His certainty is of course his downfall . The Rock-as he was nicknamed-never faltered , at least in his imagination . Peter was obstinate , single-minded , as loyal a friend as you might find . But he was blind to the limits of his courage , ignorant of his own capacity for sinfulness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief is the predecessor to all truly great sins . So Jesus presses a little further , describing the very moment when the denial would come , numbering the times for him . And Peter repeats his boast : " Even though I should have to die with you , I will not deny you ! " And we who know the story wince , because it 's already been written , the crowing of the cock and the three deadly denials , the horror at a shameful prophecy fulfilled , and the bitterness of his tears . We ache with Peter because we have known this shame and have wept those tears ourselves . What makes the story of Jesus ' Passion so intensely involving for the whole church is that we can not be bystanders in the reading of it . We have denied our Lord , we have slept through his agony , we have been paid coin for our betrayals , and we have deserted when the hour of our discipleship required the most of us . But for the moment , Peter still believes in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All except one , that is , though perhaps even Judas tries to kid himself that what he is doing has a motive higher than silver . The group pushes away from the table , singing hymns on their way to the garden where Jesus liked to pray and they preferred to nap . Jesus makes a special effort this night to get Peter , James , and John to pray with him , taking them aside personally and asking for their support . But soon they are dozing , and Jesus is alone in his anguish . ONCE I , TOO , CLOSED MY EYES WHEN A FRIEND ASKED ME TO keep vigil with him . He was a coworker going through a difficult divorce . His sense of loss was catastrophic , and he was fearful of a future without his wife . I knew the couple for many years and liked both of them . I felt divided about their marriage and who might bear the blame for its dissolution . I did not know how involved I wanted to be in their private pain and the messiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was none of my business , really . Divorce , like marriage , is between two people . It had nothing to do with me . I closed my eyes , so I did not have to watch a man drowning . At least , one might argue , sleeping past someone 's anguish is not the same as outright betrayal . What Judas did , we like to think , is the worst thing a person can do . Jesus once said no greater love is there than this : that someone should lay down life for a friend . Surely to turn a friend over to death is the reversal of this great charity and deserves our entire loathing . We may be moral cowards from time to time , but traitors ? That , we want to believe , is beyond us . We would not betray anyone , least of all a friend , someone who had reason to count on our confidence and loyalty . We set an immutable distinction between what Peter did and what Judas did during Jesus ' Passion . Peter simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of fear and the instinct for self-preservation . But what Judas did was motivated by some thing much darker . Was it greed or pride or power that seduced him into running to the religious leaders that night ? Were his religious sensibilities offended by Jesus ' liberal stance toward sinners ? Was he impatient with Jesus ' politics or just tired of being on what had to be the losing side , when the powers of Jerusalem eventually asserted themselves ? Whatever his motivation might have been , we find it much easier to forgive Peter 's fearful indiscretion than Judas ' poison kiss . But in fact , the two are on a spectrum of moral evil that differs mostly by degree . I can still see the injury on the face a woman I once betrayed . She was a self-made businesswoman who had started out as a single parent waiting on tables at night to make ends meet . She had known the hunger and loneliness of want , and without the education or credentials to make it to the top , she had managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and infallible instincts . My admiration for her was enormous , and we became close friends . Until the day her business landed her a seat on a parish commission with me . We found ourselves the only two women in a roomful of clergy and men in gray suits . The suits all had MBAs . The clergy wrote my paychecks . The two of us felt outnumbered and outgunned on the commission , but we shared a mutual set of values and goals that we agreed to communicate as a voting block . When it came time to make her presentation , my friend stood and began with great courage . But I could see at once that the suits and collars were unanimously unimpressed by her assessment . I could n't say whether it was simply a matter of principle or if her lack of professional credentials factored in to make the room so frigid during her presentation . I do n't want to think it was mere sexism , but certainly one could suspect that , too . The truth was , her plan was simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish our goals more quickly than what the businessmen were proposing . But because their companies were the ones who stood to make the profit , they would n't be inclined to support a different approach . The longer my friend spoke , the colder the room got . Finally someone made a sarcastic remark at her expense , and the room broke into unkind laughter . It was apparent the rest of the commission found her plan ridiculous and were not about to consider it . One of the associate pastors took this opportunity to lean over and advise me quietly : " Do n't make a fool of yourself . Learn to be a political player , for once . " I froze . Suddenly my desire to defend my friend 's proposal was staggered by my desire to appear credible and sensible to my bosses . In my heart I believed my friend 's proposal was better . But it was also apparent that it was already defeated . Did it make any sense to sacrifice myself " politically " for a dead platform ? I voted against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated the decision . The woman stood , pained and shocked . Later , when she confronted me about it , she said , " It was n't your vote that hurt me . It was how you valued the approval of those priests over your love for me . " Since that day , I have wondered about Judas and his intentions . I have wondered what may have been whispered in his ear to make him cold enough , even for an instant , to betray a friend . And I have learned that the only real way to make a fool of oneself is to be a political player . MORAL COWARDICE MAY HAVE DRIVEN PETER TO LIE , Judas to betray , and the disciples to sleep while Jesus sweat blood in the garden . It also drove the bulk of the disciples into hiding from the time of Jesus ' arrest until Pentecost . I could tell stories of my various desertions : The times I was not with my family when they needed me . The sick I did not visit in the hospitals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through on . The phone calls I did not return . The reading of the Passion narrative every Holy Week compels me to a confessional litany of my denials and betrayals , my slumber and my hiding . The purpose of such reflection is not hopeless breast-beating but the purposeful examen of the classic Confession . The end result of Confession is not to feel bad about oneself but to know the liberating joy of God 's forgiveness . Because these moral cowards of scripture are offered the same thing we are : the chance to redeem themselves . Peter the liar becomes the head of the church . Those who slept through the agony in the garden would one day face their own martyrdom with great courage . The pack who ran away on Thursday night would soon be the bearers of the Pentecost fire . Only the one who refused to turn and be forgiven remained lost in the dark . Because of this , I confess my sins and trust in God 's mercy . And I have hopes that the next time someone in need whispers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will be a sufficiently redeemed disciple to answer , " Yes !
