Two Rivers <p> There are n't really two rivers in Two Rivers , Vermont . There 's the Connecticut , of course ( single-minded with its rushing blue-gray water ) , but the other river is really just a wide and quiet creek . Where they intersect , now that 's the real thing . Because the place where the creek meets the Connecticut , where the two strangely different moving bodies of water join , is the stillest place I 've ever seen . And in that stillness , it almost seems possible that the creek could keep on going , minding its own business , that it might emerge on the other side and keep on traveling away from town . But nature does n't work that way , does n't allow for this kind of deviation . What must ( and does ) happen is that the small creek gets caught up in the big river 's arms , convinced or coerced to join it on its more important journey . <p> The girl was shivering , her arms wrapped around her waist , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were small teeth in a tidy row , like a child 's . <p> I peeled off my flannel shirt , which was the driest thing I had on me , and offered it to her . She accepted the shirt , awkwardly pulling it on . The sleeves hung over her hands ; she almost disappeared inside it when she sat down . <p> " What 's your name ? " I asked softly . She was like a wounded animal , knees curled to her chest and trembling . <p> " Marguerite , " she said , shaking her head . <p> " Your mother 's dead ? " I asked . <p> The girl looked down at her hands and nodded . <p> " Was she on the train ? " <p> She kept looking at the ground . <p> " Where were you going ? " I asked . <p> " Up north , " she said . <p> " Canada ? " <p> She looked up at me then , water beaded up and glistening on her eyelashes . She nodded . " Canada . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She looked toward the woods , chattering . " I got an aunt , " she said . <p> " Well , let 's get back to my house and you can give her a call . Let her know you 're okay , " I offered . " It ai n't like that , " she said , shaking her head . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " I mean , she do n't know I 'm coming . My daddy ... " Her voice trailed off . <p> " Can we call him ? " <p> " No ! " she said loudly , shaking her head . And then she reached for my hand . " He sent me away . My mama 's dead . I ai n't got nobody . " <p> " Okay , okay , " I said , trying to sort everything out in my mind . <p> " We need to go to the station , let them know you 're alive . Then they can get in touch with your aunt and we 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take you , we 'll go to the police . They 'll talk to your daddy . He 's your father . He has obligations . " <p> " No ! " she cried again , squeezing my hand hard . " Please . Maybe I can just stay a little while . I ca n't go back there . I ca n't . " Her eyes were wild and scared . One was the same color as river water , blue-gray and moving . The other was almost black . Determined . Like stone . " Let them think I drowned . " <p> " You ca n't just pretend you 're dead . " <p> " Why not ? " she asked , both of her eyes growing dark . <p> I flinched . " Two Rivers is a small town . People are going to wonder where you came from . " <p> " Maybe I 'm your cousin , " she said , her eyes brightening . She wiped her tears with the back of her hand . " Your cousin from Louisiana . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cousins from Louisiana . " <p> " From Alabama then . I do n't know . Mississippi , " she persisted , clearly irritated . <p> " Listen , " I said . " I 'm not sure folks are going to buy the idea that you and I are family . " <p> The girl looked square at me , studying my face , as if contemplating the possibility herself . <p> " I 've got a little girl , " I said . " I ca n't just bring a stranger into my house . " <p> At the mention of Shelly , the girl reached out and grabbed my wrist , pressed my hand hard against her pregnant belly . When I pulled my hand back , she held onto my wrist , and she moved toward me . She was so close to my face I could smell the bubble gum smell of her breath . Her eyes were frantic , and she quickly pressed her lips against my forehead . It was such a tender gesture , it made me suck in my breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise , " she said . <p> She looked at me again , and I willed myself to look into those disconcerting eyes . I concentrated on the blue one , the one the color of the river , waiting for her to speak . But she did n't say anything else ; she simply took my hand and waited for me to take her home . <p> " You can stay for a little while , just until we get everything straightened out . " And then , because she looked as if she might cry , " I promise , everything will be okay . " <p> * * * <p> " Thank you , " the girl whispered , though it could have just been the wind rushing in my ears . She was riding on the back of my bicycle as I pedaled away from the accident at the river , through the woods , and back toward town . She held on to my waist tightly , her heartbeat hard and steady against my back . I was careful to avoid anything that might jar her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only sound was of bicycle tires crushing leaves . I worried about what would happen when I stopped pedaling , when the journey out of the woods inevitably ended , and so I concentrated on finding a clear and unobstructed path through the forest , taking great care to slow down when the terrain grew rough . Too quickly , the woods opened up to the high school parking lot . <p> I stopped . " If it 's okay with you , I should probably leave you here and have you meet me at the apartment , " I said . " Not the best idea for people to see us riding through town together . " <p> She climbed carefully down from the seat . She set the small suitcase she had with her onto the pavement , straightened her skirt , and touched her wet hair self-consciously . When she took off my shirt and handed it to me , I thought for a moment that she was going to let me go . I imagined pedaling away as fast as I could . I imagined forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river . But instead , I stayed on the bicycle , unsure of what to do next . I gripped the handlebars tightly , ready to go , but immobilized . <p> The lot was full of cars but empty of students and teachers . We were bound to be discovered by some kid ditching class or sneaking a smoke . <p> " This a high school ? " she asked , looking at the low brick building in front of us . At the football field in the distance . <p> " Yeah , " I said . It was my high school , unchanged in all the years since I 'd graduated . I knew every brick in this building 's walls . Every vine of ivy clinging to them . I knew the smell of the cafeteria vent on a cold autumn afternoon , the sound of the bell announcing the beginning of the day . <p> " No one will think nothin ' of it if they see me here then ? " she asked . <p> I shook my head , though I was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , dripping wet and pregnant in the high school parking lot . While it had its share of matriculated expectant mothers , Two Rivers High had seen all of two black students in the last two decades . <p> " Walk that way , " I said , motioning toward the road that would wind behind the school and ultimately down into the village where I lived . " I live on Depot Street . Upstairs , above Sunset Lanes Bowling Alley . Number two . I 'll be waiting . I 'll make you some soup or something . Then we 'll figure out what to do . " <p> I stood up on the pedals and pushed off , looking over my shoulder at her briefly , and then rode away as fast as my tired legs would allow . I should have gone home . It would n't take her long to walk from the high school into the village . I knew the apartment was in no condition for company , and that the folks at work were probably wondering where I 'd gone . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying me away from the high school , down the winding road toward town , and then onto the little dead-end street I had n't visited in more than twelve years . As if Betsy would simply be waiting there , ready to help me figure out what to do next . <p> Betsy <p> The neighborhood in Two Rivers where Betsy and I grew up was made up of row after row of crooked Victorians-crumbling monstrosities sinking in upon themselves . Each house on Charles Street had its own peculiar tendencies . The one next-door to ours had a widow 's walk whose railing had , unprovoked by either natural or unnatural disaster , collapsed into a pile of pick-up sticks on the lawn below one afternoon . The family who lived at the end of the street had the misfortune of owning a house that would n't stay painted . No matter what pastel color they chose each summer , by the following spring it would have shrugged off the pink or yellow or lavender , the paint peeling and curling like old skin . My own family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put a ball on the kitchen floor and let go , it would roll straight into the dining room ( through the legs of the heavy wooden table ) , past my mother 's study , and finally into the living room where the pile of my father 's failed inventions inevitably stopped the ball 's trajectory . Most of the homeowners in our neighborhood had at some point given up , resigning themselves to sinking foundations and roofs . To the inevitable decay . There simply was n't the time or the money or the love required to keep the places up . This was a street of sad houses . Except for the Parkers ' place . <p> Though it was one of the oldest homes in the neighborhood , the Parkers ' house was meticulously maintained . Its paint was fresh : white with green shutters and trim . Its chimney was straight . The cupola sat like an elaborate cake decoration on top of the house . A clean white fence enclosed the front yard , which looked exactly as the town barber 's yard should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ littered the periphery of the yard in meditated disarray . A swing hung still and straight on the front porch , and the porch light came on without fail or flicker each night at dusk . On a street of forlorn houses , the Parkers ' made the other houses look like neglected children . <p> Of course , I knew Betsy Parker long before I loved her . We had lived on the same street since we were born . Our fathers nodded at each other as they went off to work each morning . Our mothers made polite small talk when they saw each other at the market . Betsy and I had knocked heads once during a game of street hockey , the result of which were two identical blue goose eggs on our respective foreheads . In the sixth grade , we had been the last two standing in a spelling bee ( though I 'd ultimately won with the word lucid ) . But in the summer of 1958 , when we were twelve , our relationship changed from one necessitated by mere proximity into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me then . In fact , she did n't love me for a long , long time . But that summer the seed was planted , and my unrequited passion , like all the other untamed weeds in our yard , grew to epic and tangled proportions by summer 's end . <p> When school let out in June , I 'd taken up fishing , drawn by a local legend that , on a good day , the spot where the two rivers meet was teaming with rainbow trout . But by July I 'd spent entire days with my line in the water , and I still had yet to catch a single trout ( or any other kind of fish for that matter ) . The day I found myself smitten by Betsy , I 'd also spent fishing , and , once again , I had n't caught anything but a cold . I 'd meant to go home . I thought I might take a snooze in the hammock in our backyard . But instead of walking down the shady side of Depot Street to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I crossed the street , into the sun . Once there , I stood in front of her , rendered mute . <p> Orange Crush and skinned knees . This was Betsy at twelve . I 'd walked past Betsy Parker a thousand times before . A thousand bottles of Orange Crush . A thousand Band-aids . But that day , as I strolled past her daddy 's barbershop , there she was , with fresh scabs on both golden knees , and it felt like I was seeing her for the very first time . I 'm not sure which made me dizzier-the twirling red , white and blue barber pole or Betsy . Can I remember the way I saw her then ? You 'd think it would be hard after all these years , but it is n't . Perhaps I was memorizing her before I even knew I should . Here 's the way she looked to me in June when we were twelve : her fingers were long , her legs longer , stretched out on the steps of her daddy 's shop where she sipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange , and her hair was like syrup running down her back . ( I remember touching my tongue to my lips when I saw her . ) <p> Betsy sipped long and thoughtfully . Then she leaned toward me and looked into my empty bucket . " Whadja catch ? " <p> I felt heat rising to my ears . " Not much today . " <p> " Yesterday ? " <p> " Not much yesterday either . " <p> " Why do you bother ? " she asked . " If you do n't ever catch anything ? " <p> I shrugged . <p> " You 're probably the kind who sees the glass half full . " She sighed and sipped the last of her soda pop loudly . " Not me , I 'm a half-empty kind of girl . " <p> I did n't know what she meant , only that she thought we were somehow fundamentally different , and this made my heart ache . <p> " You live on my street , " I said stupidly . <p> " You live on my street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pavement between us . She stuck one bare foot out in front of her and spun the bottle with her toe . It clanked and spun and stopped , its neck pointing right at me . <p> I did n't know what to say , so I bent over and picked the bottle up . The glass was still cold . I dropped it into my empty bucket , as if that could make up somehow for my failure as a fisherman . " That 's worth two cents . " <p> " Coulda been worth a lot more than that , " she said , smiling . <p> I walked home that day with Betsy Parker 's Orange Crush bottle clanging against the inside of my bucket . From my bedroom window I could see the pristine facade of the Parkers ' house , their immaculate lawn . I felt like an idiot . First , because I 'd missed what I quickly realized was a chance at kissing Betsy . And second , because twelve whole years had already passed before I realized that she 'd been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle out and held it to my lips . The glass was sticky , sweet . I tipped the empty bottle , leaning my head back , waiting for the last sweet drops to fall into my throat . <p> After that day , I gave up my fishing trips in favor of a new futile endeavor , one that would last longer than most boys my age would have had patience for . But Betsy was right , I was a " half-full " kind of person , and I had high hopes . I knew I 'd get a second chance ; it was just a matter of time . <p> The Girl <p> I only stood in front of the Parkers ' house long enough to know I should n't be there . The house had recently been painted , and the lawn was trimmed , the hedges clipped . There was a new family living here . A child was peering out at me through the bay window . Soon , the child 's mother opened the curtains and , seeing me , quickly drew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedaled quickly home . <p> By the time I 'd climbed the stairs to my apartment , I wondered if I 'd only dreamed the girl at the river , a hallucination brought on by too many nights without sleep . I changed out of my wet clothes , made a pot of coffee , and called the freight office to say I 'd been at the wreck all morning-that I 'd come by the office in a few hours . Only Lenny Herman , the station agent , was there . Everyone else was still down by the river . When almost an hour had passed and she still had n't appeared , I was fairly certain that I 'd only imagined her . I started to gather my things to head back to work , when there was a weak knock on my door . <p> She stood in the kitchen holding her wet shoes in one hand and the dripping suitcase in the other . I motioned for her to sit down at the kitchen table , but she shook her head . <p> " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " There are some clean towels in the bathroom . I can get some dry clothes . " <p> She nodded and set her wet shoes down by the door . I figured I could find something of Shelly 's that would fit her . She followed behind me slowly down the short hallway , stopping to look at the pictures hanging on the wall . Shelly 's class pictures . Our wedding photo . She touched the top of the frame , gently straightening it . I grabbed a pair of sweatpants and a T-shirt from Shelly 's drawer and handed them to her . She took them and disappeared into the bathroom . <p> I quickly assessed the state of my house , untidy still from the morning 's chaos . There were dirty dishes on the table ( cereal bowls with colored milk , glasses rimmed with orange pulp ) . Shelly 's shoes were scattered all over the floor , which needed to be swept . I 'd splattered chocolate batter on the backsplash when I made Shelly 's cupcakes , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wiped at the mess in a useless attempt to make the kitchen less of a disaster . I was wringing it out in the sink when she came out of the bathroom . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
