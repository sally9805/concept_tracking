<p> PINEDALE , WYO. - Oil and gas producers are stampeding to the Rockies . <p> With natural gas prices hitting all-time highs and Gulf of Mexico production still recovering from a hurricane-plagued year , energy companies - many with ties to Houston - are drilling up long-neglected fields . <p> The Rockies are thought to hold enough gas to heat and cool 70 million homes for nearly half a century , the National Petroleum Council estimates . But those resources are usually found in hard-to-produce deposits . <p> In their headlong rush , the energy companies are helping transform the nation 's least populous state , where pronghorn antelope are said to still outnumber people . <p> Up and down Wyoming , oil-field service workers are packing hotels , not to mention Applebee 's restaurants . <p> They 're driving up local real estate prices and bedding down in spartan - and that means booze-free - living quarters dubbed " man camps . " <p> Houston-based Halliburton Co. even promised to lease every room for years in a hotel yet to be built to jump-start that project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , virtually every energy company in the region is still desperate for help . <p> " It 's tough attracting and keeping employees , " said Delmar Crochet , director of business development for STS Thru Tubing , a Lafayette , La. - based oil-field service company . " " " The state 's got 500,000 people in it , and the industry 's on fire . " <p> Or as Paul Taylor , a drilling supervisor for Sierra Engineering , puts it : " If you can pass the U.A. ( urine analysis ) , you 've got a job . " <p> The lure for energy companies is an estimated 284 trillion cubic feet of gas that could be produced in the Rockies using current technology , according to the National Petroleum Council , an industry advisory group for the federal government . <p> The Rocky Mountain region " is literally the Middle East to natural gas , " declared Fred Barrett , president of Denver-based producer Bill Barrett Corp. , one of the largest operators in the region . <p> And unlike , say , the Gulf Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , with 80 percent to 85 percent of the resources still in the ground , Barrett said . <p> With numerous forecasters predicting natural gas prices will remain aloft for the foreseeable future , energy companies are spending billions of dollars to drill in an area largely overlooked since the oil and gas bust of the mid-1980s . <p> BP , for instance , showed how much it believed in the area 's potential when it announced plans in October to spend approximately $2.2 billion in the next 15 years to drill 2,000 wells in Wyoming 's Wamsutter Field . <p> Because the federal government controls so much of the land in this part of the country , oil and gas producers have flooded the Bureau of Land Management with applications for permits to drill . <p> In fiscal 2004 , the bureau approved 5,747 drilling applications to drill on public lands in Wyoming , Colorado , New Mexico , Utah and Montana , up fourfold from the industry slump in 1999 . And the Bush administration is trying to speed the approval process . <p> Scores of drilling rigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gas production was 31 percent higher in this region last year - 64 percent higher in Wyoming - than in 1999 , the Energy Information Administration reported . <p> The race for housing <p> For lonely towns such as Pinedale - population 1,412 - the surge in drilling has brought dramatic change . <p> Sitting nearly a mile and a half above sea level and home to the Museum of the Mountain Man , Pinedale previously depended largely on vacationers who would trickle south from Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks . The energy business is helping to even some of the town 's seasonal economic fluctuations . <p> Housing prices have skyrocketed . <p> Homes that once sold for $100,000 now go for $225,000 , noted local businessman Al Etcheverry . <p> With the influx of oil-field service workers , finding housing at any price in a town sandwiched between public lands and private ranches has required some creative solutions . <p> To encourage a local developer to build a residence-style hotel , for instance , Halliburton has agreed to lease 100 rooms for up to five years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But Halliburton needed housing right away for workers rotating in for 20-day stints . <p> Overseas , Halliburton builds housing for U.S. troops . In Wyoming , the company rents temporary housing from a Canadian firm , trailers plunked down in an industrial park . <p> About 150 workers , most from the oil-patch town of Duncan , Okla. , are housed in a dormitory-style " man camp . " <p> The living quarters are comfortable enough - single rooms , communal showers - and meals are provided . But the rules are strict . Workers must remove their boots ( or wear powder-blue , hospital-style shoe covers ) before entering the buildings . And no alcohol or drugs are permitted . <p> Tight sands ' issue <p> With all the drilling rigs twinkling in the frosty Wyoming night just west of the man camp , it 's hard to imagine the energy companies all but ignored this region for years . <p> Consider the Pinedale Anticline , the nation 's fourth-largest gas field , just outside town . <p> Houston-based Ultra Petroleum and its partners will drill 110 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field that has become the cornerstone of a young company with a market value of about $9 billion . <p> Located in the Upper Green River Valley , the Pinedale Field was discovered in 1939 . But drilling has been sporadic and , for most of the field 's life , commercially inviable . <p> That 's because the gas in this field is locked in what 's known in the industry as " tight sands , " formations of closely packed sand grains with natural gas trapped in the tiny spaces in between . <p> To get the gas to flow out of these formations , a drilling company must pump specially designed fluids under high pressure into a well to create fractures in the rock formations and allow the gas to escape . <p> Though the strategy behind stimulating production in fields like Pinedale has been around for a long time , oil-well service companies have perfected the chemicals and machinery needed to coax gas out of these rocks . <p> And the recent high gas prices have given producers the cushion they need to tackle such projects with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas output today comes from tight sands and other " unconventional " sources , noted Fred Lawrence , vice president of economics and international affairs for the Independent Petroleum Association of America . <p> With all the new exploration in the Rockies , that percentage is almost sure to rise . <p> In developing a field such as the Pinedale Anticline , though , Ultra Petroleum faces challenges unique to this region . <p> For example , for more than five months of the year the company must curtail operations in this sagebrush-rich , high desert in sight of the Wind River Mountain Range to avoid disturbing migrating mule deer and pronghorn antelope . <p> The Rocky Mountain region also lacks natural gas pipelines , creating a bottleneck that forces producers here to sell their gas at a discount - roughly $3 per thousand cubic feet less than the benchmark price on the Gulf Coast . <p> Obstacles remain <p> With demand for pipeline capacity growing , interstate pipeline operators such as Houston 's Kinder Morgan Energy Partners ( teamed up with Sempra Energy ) and Houston-based El Paso Corp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry Rocky Mountain resources to gas-starved markets in the East . <p> Whether either or both pipelines will be built remains a question . <p> Stephen Beasley , president of El Paso 's Eastern Pipeline Group , said pressure to build a new pipeline is coming not just from Rocky Mountain producers but from gas users eager to diversify their gas supply lines in the wake of this year 's hurricanes . <p> Despite the difficulties , the Rockies represent " the biggest play in North America right now , when it comes to natural gas , " said Sam McClure , Ultra 's production superintendent for the Pinedale Field . <p> Though natural gas is the undoubted driver of this region 's energy boom , Houston-based Newfield Exploration Co. is drilling for crude . <p> In the Uinta Basin of northeastern Utah , south of the spectacular Flaming Gorge , Newfield is developing the Monument Butte Oil Field . <p> The rock here also is tight , so the oil flows slowly . Wells in this field produce only about 65 barrels a day . With 772 wells pumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , comparable to one good well in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico . <p> Newfield 's costs are high - about $20 a barrel - but with Monument Butte crude selling in the high $50s last week , the company is determined to drill as many as 225 wells a year . <p> Plenty of jobs available <p> For energy companies wanting to do business in the Rockies , finding qualified workers is often their greatest challenge . The industry is rife with stories of oil-field service companies raiding one another 's staffs . <p> The entire oil and gas sector is struggling with a shortage of workers . <p> Hundreds of thousands left the industry in the past two decades , burned by the repeated boom-and-bust cycles . <p> Persuading experienced workers to relocate to this remote and often bitterly cold area is difficult . <p> STS 's Crochet , looking for a worker willing to relocate to Wyoming , placed an ad in a Louisiana paper . He got one call , but the applicant did n't want the job . <p> " He decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for a flight out of Rock Springs , Wyo . " His wife did n't want to move to Rock Springs . " <p> Though conditions in Wyoming 's gas fields can be tough , an experienced oil-field crewman can command an annual salary upward of $95,000 , industry officials say . <p> An icy wind whipped Chance Nelson 's coveralls on a recent snowy afternoon , as he stripped fluid from a wireline used for testing a well . His third day on the job , Nelson , 21 , was handling the position on the drilling rig known as the " worm 's corner . " <p> Nelson just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq and decided to give the energy business a try . " It sounded like a plan , " Nelson said . " I thought I might stay with the money . " <p> McClure , a Wyoming native and petroleum engineer by training , jokes that he went into the only business somebody who wanted to stay in Wyoming could choose . <p> Because of a lack of jobs before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state to find work . <p> McClure , 32 , oversees an operation where Ultra Petroleum will spend $395 million this year . <p> For Pinedale 's older generation , McClure exemplifies what they appreciate most about all the new drilling activity . <p> " We 've got our young people back , " said Bob Bing , owner of The Cowboy Shop in Pine- dale . <p> ... <p> ROCKY MOUNTAIN RESOURCES <p> Here 's a look at the percentage of U.S. total estimated natural gas reserves located in the Rockies . <p> WYOMING .. 11.8% <p> NEW MEXICO .. 9.6% <p> COLORADO .. 7.7% <p> UTAH .. 2% <p> MONTANA .. 0.5% <p> FIVE-STATE .. 31.6% <p> Source : Energy Information Administration <p> ... <p> A MILE-HIGH BOOM <p> Facts and figures about oil and natural gas production in the Rocky Mountain area : <p> SIX FOLD INCREASE ... <p> The Bureau of Land Management approved 5,747 applications to drill on public lands in Wyoming , Colorado , Utah , New Mexico and Montana in 2004 , a fourfold increase since 1999 . <p> GOING PUBLIC ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 to 2004 . <p> AS GAS PRICES RISE ... <p> Nearly one-fifth of the nation 's gas production comes from " tight sands " fields that only recently have become economically viable for drilling . <p> NEW TECHNOLOGY ... <p> Nearly one-third of the nation 's gas output comes from places the energy industry would n't have dreamed of operating in just a few years ago . <p> ... <p> WILDLIFE <p> Drilling triggers concerns over the effect on animals during the harsh winter season .
