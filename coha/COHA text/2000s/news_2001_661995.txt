<p> Here are excerpts from editorials from the United States and abroad : <p> Nov. 12 <p> The Muskogee ( Okla . ) Daily Phoenix &; Times-Democrat , on jumping to conclusions : <p> Airplanes crash . Sometimes the cause is mechanical failure . Sometimes it is bad weather , Sometimes it is pilot error . And sometimes , it is a terrorist attack . <p> On Monday , American Airlines Flight 587 , an Airbus A300 with 246 passengers and nine crew members aboard , went down at 9:17 a.m. in clear , sunny weather in the waterfront neighborhood 15 miles from Manhattan . <p> Following the Sept. 11 airborne terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and New York City 's World Trade Center , speculation that Monday 's crash also resulted from a terrorist attack is unavoidable . <p> Yet , as a senior Bush administration official said , " It 's looking like it 's not a terrorist attack . " However , the official added , " We ca n't reach a firm conclusion yet . " <p> ... Until the responsible agencies find credible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And potentially more harmful than that . <p> If panicky Americans believe , without any hard evidence , that terrorists brought down Flight 587 , Osama bin Laden , the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks , will win a victory - perhaps by default . <p> Nov. 11 <p> Los Angeles Times , on keeping track of bioterror : <p> ... The FBI 's failure to locate every lunatic who tries to cook up anthrax in a Baghdad bathtub is forgivable . But its inability after an intense , monthlong investigation to get even an inkling of which U.S. labs have pathogens such as smallpox and anthrax exposes an inexcusable lapse in oversight that has put the nation at risk . <p> The failure may be less the agency 's than Congress ' . While legislators have passed bills requiring everyone from hazardous-material truckers to school bus drivers to submit to criminal background checks , they have imposed no such requirement on scientists who routinely handle the most virulent biological toxins . No special certification is required to possess these agents , no government office keeps track of labs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Nov. 7 , Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill to close those loopholes . The bill identifies the 32 most toxic biological agents ... and prohibits ordinary Americans from stockpiling them . It requires the secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize private and public labs wishing to experiment with the toxic agents , compels labs to report which ones they are stockpiling , and demands that researchers handling them pass a criminal background check . <p> Academics defeated an attempt by the Clinton administration to pass similar legislation two years ago . They worry that overly zealous federal restrictions will scare scientists away from experimenting with bioagents at the very time when scientific expertise is most critical to national defense . ... Ronald Atlas , president-elect of the American Society for Microbiology , fretted that ( Feinstein 's ) bill " will cause some heartburn for some university administrators . " <p> Let their stomachs rumble . <p> Nov. 13 <p> Evansville ( Ind . ) Courier &; Press , on national spirit : <p> Todd Beamer said , " Let 's roll , " as he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sept. 11 , and that 's what President Bush said to the nation Thursday night as he encouraged a different kind of anti-terrorist action . <p> More is needed , as the president said . We must maintain our morale , we must restore our economic vigor , we must sustain our liberty-loving democracy , and such objectives require going about our business with the normal high energy of a free , robust people and - especially important - doing for each other in ways large and small . <p> Can that happen on the needed scale ? Of course . It is happening . This country is more united now than most of us can remember it ever having been . <p> President Bush reminded us that the stakes in all of this are high : advancing civilization and defeating those who want to kill us for the sake of hate . If we find the spirit of Beamer - whose words were transmitted by a cellular phone before his plane 's crash - we will prevail . If ? There should be no " if " here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nov. 12 <p> The Tribune-Democrat , Johnstown , Pa. , on the latest interest rate cut : <p> For the 10th time this year , the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates a half percentage point to 2 percent the other day . The rates began the year at 6.5 percent . <p> Those cuts , which eventually trickle down to consumers , have certainly helped purchasers of homes , with low-interest mortgages , and cars , with zooming sales propelled by the automakers ' heavily promoted zero percent financing deals . <p> But other segments of the economy have been in deep trouble in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks . In the last week alone , unemployment jumped to a five-year high of 5.4 percent in October and consumer confidence fell to a 71/2-year low . <p> Some analysts would call those figures indicative of a recession . But others , such as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan , believe the cuts are just the tonic our quivering economy needs to pluck it from the depths . <p> So far , nine rate cuts have n't made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky charm because , with a 2 percent rate , it appears as if money is being given away . <p> Or , at least , at bargain basement rates . <p> Nov. 7 <p> The Daily Independent , Ashland , Ky. , on conditions in Afghanistan : <p> Afghanistan is a crushing and brutal place all year , but especially so in winter . The U.S.-led coalition did not initially destabilize the country , and we are not at fault for all its starvation and suffering . <p> But common decency and the urgent need to prevent mass starvation demand that we greatly and quickly expand our humanitarian aid effort for civilians within and outside Afghanistan before winter sets in . <p> The Afghans ' suffering predates Sept. 11 and the subsequent pullout of aid workers who feared for their lives . Afghan citizens were weakened by two decades of armed conflict . Then the worst drought in 30 years caused crops to fail . Consequently , 6 million to 7 million people , mostly women and children , now face starvation - a number that easily dwarfs the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Moreover , without aid workers on the ground , there is no way to assure that the rations reach the citizens who need it . <p> The World Food Program estimates it takes 55,000 tons of food monthly to feed those facing famine , and that excludes such staples as clean water , fuel for cooking and shelter-making materials . <p> Almost all those shipments have been suspended since the bombing campaign began . Since the only steady way to move so many goods is by truck , the international community must act quickly to provide safe passage for aid convoys before mountain roads become impassable and interior regions of Afghanistan are closed off until spring . <p> If we fail to prepare for the coming humanitarian crises in Central Asia , we risk intensifying the tumult there and weakening international support for the war against terrorism . The task is daunting , and time is short . <p> Nov. 12 <p> Walla Walla ( Wash . ) Union-Bulletin , on the Red Cross misusing donations : <p> The Red Cross , the agency most Americans turned to in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation down . Its once pristine image is tarnished . The Red Cross received donations and pledges of $564 million specifically to aid the victims and the families of the terrorist attacks . <p> So far , too few of the dollars have landed where Americans expected . There have been conflicting reports on where the money will be spent . But what is clear at this point is some top Red Cross officials planned to siphon off a healthy chunk for administrative costs . Other money has been targeted for ongoing Red Cross programs . <p> This has n't set well with the donors . When they opened their hearts - and wallets - in the wake of the tragedy , they wanted to help the people they saw on TV suffering in New York and Washington , D.C. <p> The Red Cross should have followed those wishes - or not accepted the donations . Looking at it as a windfall , as some in the agency have done , is wrong . <p> The Red Cross needs to quickly get some bandages on its self-inflicted public relations wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to programs that directly help the victims . <p> Justifying extraordinary spending on administration or programs wo n't cut it . Results are all that can heal the wound . <p> Nov. 13 <p> The Palm Beach Post , West Palm Beach , Fla. , on the latest recount of the 2000 presidential election ballots : <p> After the most complete review of ballots from Florida 's 2000 presidential election , it is clear that the state 's system ... thought of the voters last , not first . ... <p> Nor did the candidates think first of the voters . Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore thought first of their voters . After Mr. Bush 's attorneys failed to stop the counting of all ballots , they sought to count only those that looked promising for them . Mr. Gore 's attorneys at first sought selective counting ; not until a week after the election did the former vice president propose a statewide recount . Secretary of State Katherine Harris ... tried to count the voters out as soon as possible . <p> ... In terms of numbers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the race was a statistical dead heat . ... <p> More important , the consortium 's review confirmed that the election turned not on under-votes but on Palm Beach County 's " butterfly " ballot . ... <p> ... Yet even after Florida approved what Gov . Jeb Bush called a " world-class " election system , the state leaves matters in the hands of 67 county supervisors . The banning of punch cards does not ensure that those supervisors will turn new technology into a flawless system . <p> ... A year after " ballot bedlam , " the system still does n't put the voters first . <p> Nov. 12 <p> The Advertiser-Tribune , Tiffin , Ohio , on airport security : <p> The House-passed airport security bill takes to heart hard lessons already learned in Europe and Israel : The best way for government to increase security is to set high standards and let industry worry about how to get there . The necessary deliberation involved in a democratic regulatory process simply does not allow a bureaucracy to adjust quickly enough to changing threats . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a new pork barrel of 28,000 federal airport security screener jobs . But even with provisions putting a new security force under Justice Department authority - and therefore with somewhat lesser civil service protections - it was far short of the flexible , state-of-the-art change necessary after Sept. 11 . <p> Israel and the Europeans already have tried government-run airport security . It failed , for the simple reason that government moved too slow to respond to new threats . Israel and most European airports now have the world 's best air passenger security because they set high standards and leave it to private providers . <p> Shortly after the House passed its version of airport security legislation , President Bush quickly endorsed it and urged House and Senate conferees to get a finished product to his desk . Congress should heed the president 's wishes , thereby allowing companies to invest in airport security upgrades without fear of losing their investments to federal intervention . <p> Nov. 13 <p> Financial Times , London , on building a post-Taliban regime : <p> The U.S. has stepped up the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Northern Alliance , have been striking . Now is the time to accelerate efforts to agree on the makeup of a post-Taliban regime . <p> The military and political track are closely linked . Afghanistan is a failed state , divided on ethnic lines and vulnerable to meddling from outside powers . In the absence of a political settlement , the country will revert to chaos and civil war . <p> The United Nations can help to broker such an agreement . ... The Alliance should realize that defeat of the Taliban does not signal an outright victory for them . The Pashtuns must be included in numbers if a new regime is to have a chance of survival . <p> No one should be under any illusions . Any government in Kabul will be notional . Most of the power will remain in the hands of regional warlords . ... The UN should focus on three priorities . It should prepare to set up protectorates in the major cities . ... ( and ) provide a future peacekeeping force to assure minimum law and order . A Western-led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutral " countries could play a constructive role on the ground . <p> The third priority is to bridge divisions inside the " six-plus-two " talks involving Afghanistan 's six neighbors , plus Russia and the U.S. <p> Nov. 14 <p> Dagens Nyheter , Stockholm , Sweden , on the United Nations and rebuilding Afghanistan : <p> The United Nations must insist on the next constitution in Afghanistan taking into consideration the country 's multiethnic character and that it also becomes democratic , not only according to the principle one man , one vote . In a country that lacks a working state , the U.N . must take on the central function for a transitional period and assist both the administration and the police . The U.N . must also contribute to the writing of history , cruelty for cruelty . This is a long process , which we know from the breaking up of Yugoslavia . It is possible to see a new dawn for Afghanistan . The hope for a better future is growing . But the Taliban are not disarmed and Osama bin Laden is not arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not defeated . The battle against terrorism does not end at the borders of Afghanistan . But of course , it feels as if the first military stage so far is a success . <p> Nov. 12 <p> Folha de Sao Paulo , Brazil , on oil prices : <p> OPEC is threatening to cut oil production to avoid prices falling further . The consequences of the threat were already felt at the end of last week when prices went up by 4 percent in a single day . <p> OPEC in recent years seldom obtained full cohesion among members . In periods of high prices , many producing countries broke their quotas , lured by increased profits . In periods of low prices , they also broke quotas because oil is their main source of revenue . <p> This time , the Saudi Oil minister Ali Al-Naimi says that in order to avoid a collapse in prices , his country is ready even to lose part of its international market share . To a certain extent this is a worrying statement , because Saudi Arabia is a leading oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and Asian armed conflicts on the price of this commodity is not negligible . <p> It is unlikely in the short term that oil prices will upset the Brazilian economy . But it is convenient for the country to keep investing in search of alternate energy sources . It seems clear that efficient use of oil is not enough to avoid , in the long term , problems affecting the supply and demand of oil . <p> Nov. 13 <p> The Guardian , London , on airplane crash in New York : <p> As before , the terror was in not knowing . Once again , a towering column of dark smoke disfigured the New York skyline . Once again , a plane was down and hundreds of innocent people , aboard the aircraft and on the ground , were suddenly , horribly dead . Once again , there was a gut-wrenching flood of feelings , a sense of panic , quickly followed by shock and sheer helplessness . The rage may come later . ... <p> Not knowing , in the immediate aftermath of yesterday 's repeat horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , no claim of responsibility if it was , no warning or specific threat to the American Airlines plane , not even a hint of trouble from the pilot . Was the United Nations building , hosting a meeting on Afghanistan , the target ? Was this bomb , if it was a bomb , a response to US attacks on Osama bin Laden ? Is there more to come ? Or was it just an accident ? We do not know . That is the fear . That is how terrorism works - and why it must , for the sake of humankind , be defeated .
