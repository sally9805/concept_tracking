" You notice that no one ever calls me Mr. Mayor , " Sharpe James said with a sly smile on Tuesday , the day after he announced that he would not seek re-election to the State Senate and signaled an end to his 37 years in the contact sport known as politics . " Everybody calls me Sharpe . If I was a political boss and ran a political machine like so many say I do , then they would all call me Mr. Mayor . " <p> There , said the 71-year-old Mr. James , lies one of the secrets to his political longevity . It was his personality , his ebullience , that allowed him to serve a record five terms as mayor here . The other was that he , like so many of his supporters , grew up poor in Newark . <p> Yes , political contributors paid homage , and coughed up donations , at his birthday bash every February . But , Mr. James said , he always gave them quite a show in return , arriving on skis over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolls-Royce another . <p> " I know some of them were saluting the uniform and not the person , " he said in an interview on Tuesday at Essex County Community College , where Mr. James was a physical education teacher and track coach before going into politics and where he is now director of the Urban Issues Institute . " But they all knew that they would have fun . It would be a party . " <p> Mr. James 's announcement that he would relinquish the Senate seat that he has held since 1999 is arguably the end of an era in Newark politics . <p> His many critics say Mr. James held onto power by rewarding his friends and punishing his rivals . And the United States attorney 's office is investigating allegations that Mr. James 's administration sold city land to a friend for cut-rate prices . <p> Despite his denials that he sat at the head of a Democratic political machine , there are those who know about such things who disagree . Steve Adubato , the Democratic leader of the vote-rich North Ward for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing political boss . <p> Mr. Adubato said that Mr. James also was a cheerleader for Newark when the city had little to cheer about , but that he stayed in office too long . <p> " In the end it became about him and his friends , " Mr. Adubato said . " He did a great service for the city in the beginning , but he should have left elected office more than two terms ago . " <p> Mr. James 's decision was hardly a surprise here . His real political power evaporated last year when he decided not to seek a sixth term as mayor and left the field to Cory Booker , who had pursued the job since 2002 . Mr. James had held on to the Senate seat in a kind of political rear-guard action , still wielding the senatorial courtesy that gives legislators a veto over crucial state appointments in their areas . <p> In recent months , however , the United States attorney for New Jersey , Christopher J. Christie , has been investigating city land sales during Mr. James 's tenure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , his bodyguards and his aides to Puerto Rico , Brazil , Martha 's Vineyard and Detroit in his waning days as mayor . Since last fall , Mr. Christie 's office also has been examining real estate transactions between the city and Tamika Riley , a friend of Mr. James 's . From 2002 to 2005 , Ms. Riley bought nine lots owned by the city for a total of $46,000 and resold them for $700,000 . <p> It is not the first time that federal prosecutors have investigated Mr. James , although he has never been charged with a crime . In 1995 , the United States attorney 's office looked into how Mr. James used donations to his charitable fund , the Sharpe James Civic Association . After a separate federal investigation in 1997 , his chief of staff was convicted of taking kickbacks from insurance companies that were seeking business with the city . <p> A spokesman for Mr. Christie would not comment on any investigations that the federal prosecutor may have begun , but Mr. James conceded that records involving the trips and real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide , " Mr. James said . " They have every right to investigate me , because when you are in political office you live in a fishbowl . But I will say that many of the things they are looking at , such as the land sales and the travel , were the purview of the City Council and not the mayor . " <p> Kenneth Gibson , who became the city 's first black mayor in 1970 and who introduced Mr. James to Newark politics  --  only to be challenged and displaced by him in 1986  --  said he did not think the most recent federal investigations had prompted Mr. James to leave politics . <p> " I think Sharpe is feeling the changing of the guard , and it 's something he ca n't stop , " he said . Mr. Gibson also noted that Mayor Booker , Mr. Adubato and others had joined forces to support Teresa Ruiz , 32 , who is challenging Mr. James this year in the 29th Legislative District , which takes in parts of Newark and all of neighboring Hillside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans and a sweatshirt , insisted that he wanted to play tennis , spend time with his family and travel on his boat . <p> He also said he had learned a lesson from the way his rival , Donald Tucker , a former Newark councilman at large and assemblyman who died in 2005 after a debilitating illness , ended his public life . Mr. James said that in 2004 , when local Democratic officials gathered at a hotel here for a rally with the vice presidential nominee , John Edwards , Mr. Tucker showed up in a wheelchair and asked them to hoist him onstage to await the candidate 's arrival . <p> " We wound up waiting three hours , and Donald fell asleep in his wheelchair , and you knew he was in a lot of pain , " Mr. James said . And there was a hint of bitterness as Mr. James recalled what he said was his casting by many as " the old degenerate politician " in the challenge he faced from Mr. Booker , a former Rhodes Scholar and a child of the integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled how he defeated Mr. Booker in 2002 . <p> It was all grist , he said , for an autobiography for which he is seeking a writer and publisher . <p> " I touched so many lives , " said Mr. James . " I think a lot of people underestimated me. " ##
