<p> In warfare , the enemy 's allies include winds , clouds , dust and rain . <p> If the United States invades Iraq , the fate of GIs  --  and thousands of Iraqi soldiers and civilians  --  may depend on the heavens . Major battles may turn on phenomena as subtle as the jiggling of a barometer needle , or a shift in high-altitude winds miles above the blood and smoke . <p> Should war come , U.S. forces will rely partly on weather forecasts made in Monterey at a little-known , supercomputer-packed operation called the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center , the Navy 's global center of weather forecasting . <p> One big , white-walled room is brimming with computers the size of phone booths continually crunching weather data from hundreds of stations around the world . Roaring fans cool the computers ' microchips : otherwise , they 'd melt from the ceaseless traffic of electrons . <p> " Now we can run very high-resolution forecast models for any location on Earth . We did n't have that capability 15 years ago , even 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meteorology department at the Naval Postgraduate School next door . <p> In any Iraq war , sophisticated weather forecasts produced here will help U.S. forces to : <p>  --  Determine how to launch high-tech weapons such as cruise missiles . As they race through the atmosphere , their trajectory is influenced by variations in temperature and atmospheric density at different altitudes . A mistaken forecast may guide a missile off course , perhaps into a civilian target . <p>  --  Forecast the movement of smoke plumes , should Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ignite oil wells as he did in 1991 . The plumes can obscure military movements and confuse weapons ' sensors . <p>  --  Determine when and where to launch high-tech weapons guided by " electro-optical " sensors and lasers . Fog and dust storms confuse the sensors and dilute the laser beams . <p> U.S. armed forces ' meteorologists are haunted by past failures to forecast bad weather . <p> They have n't forgotten the botched 1980 mission to rescue hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran , wrecked partly by a dust storm ; the Navy SEALs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for thunderstorms ; and the Bosnian snows of 1996 that short-circuited mine detectors . <p> In the Iran debacle , " U.S. Army Intelligence officers untrained in meteorology fail(ed) to utilize proper weather reconnaissance and pass on ( to mission team ) forecast of dust ( storm ) effects , " according to an online historical account published by the Meteorology Team at the U.S. Army 's Aberdeen Test Center in Maryland . <p> In the Bosnian conflict , " NATO 's problems were further compounded by the weather limitations of laser-guided weapons and the weather-visibility limits of most optical sensors , " veteran military analyst Anthony H. Cordesman wrote in a 1999 book . " NATO canceled 50 percent of all sorties due to low visibility . " <p> WEATHER AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM <p> " This experience , " Cordesman notes , " is a clear lesson that the revolution in military affairs has not solved the problem of weather and poor visibility . " <p> During the Gulf War , U.S. and allied forces faced worse weather  --  especially cloudiness  --  than they had expected based on official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force 's deputy director of weather at the Pentagon . " It was a much less benign environment than we thought . " <p> Civilian meteorologists ' flubbed forecasts rarely hurt anyone . At worst , they might ruin your picnic or your day at the beach . By contrast , military meteorologists hold the lives of thousands in their hands . Hence military forecasters say they strive for greater certainty than the civilian counterparts . <p> " ' Partly cloudy with a chance of rain ' just does n't cut it , " the Pentagon 's Tileston observed . The generals " want to know where the clouds will be , what will the ( cloud ) level be . They ca n't really deal in probabilities . . . . They need to make a decision , and giving them ' 50 percent ' does n't cut it . " <p> Good forecasts do n't guarantee good military decisions , though . Different weather conditions affect different military forces in different ways ; what 's " good " weather for one branch of the military may be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general does n't automatically equate a forecast of " good weather " with " Attack ! " <p> " My boss is a C-130 pilot , " Tileston says . " When he was doing air drops over Bosnia , ' good weather ' for him was pitch-black dark , a low ( cloud ) ceiling and rain , so that he could get in and out easily . That same weather might be absolutely horrible for a fighter trying to lock onto a target ( with a laser ) . " <p> The ' 91 Gulf War was fought mostly in the desert . Should there be another war , it might climax in cities such as Baghdad . Some U.S. analysts fear that Hussein , in a last-minute act of desperation , might launch chemical or biological weapons . <p> Hence military scientists are developing computerized " dispersion models . " These simulate how aerosols  --  minute particles such as smoke , dust , microbes or toxins  --  waft through the buildings and alleyways of cities , where U.S. troops might fight . But the military does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ( develop ) city-scale meteorology , and we want to get to that capability fairly soon . . . inside 10 years or so , " says Capt . Chris Gunderson , commanding officer of Fleet Numerical , the Navy 's forecasting center in Monterey . <p> COMPUTER MODELS CRUDE <p> But computers ca n't solve all forecasting problems . Computer models remain quite crude , compared with the extraordinary complexity of the terrestrial atmosphere and topography . Even sophisticated computer simulations may represent a mountain range with a few pixels , or a sinuous coastline as a few jagged lines . <p> Hence military meteorologists on foreign missions rely heavily on " local knowledge , " such as historical records of the idiosyncrasies of local weather . While on duty in , say , Bahrain , they record what they learn in a weather handbook , which is passed on to their successors . <p> Sometimes to no avail . During a recent interview , Fleet Numerical meteorologist Douglas Marble recalled how in 1998 , he had been on a Navy carrier in the Middle East . Numerous aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurked toward the north . <p> Suddenly , severe winds ripped across the deck of the ship . Rather than risk landing on the carrier deck , some aircraft fled to landing fields onshore . Later , Navy meteorologists realized what had happened : The passing thunderstorm 's winds had hit the Zagros Mountains in Iran , then " bounced " back toward the carrier . <p> Later , Navy meteorologists checked the local weather handbook . Sure enough , the handbook recorded past instances of the same windy phenomenon . But no one had remembered it . <p> That time , the Navy was lucky ; no one was hurt or killed . During wartime , though , a similar memory lapse might cost lives and victories . <p> " Each of us has an individual story like that , " interjects Gunderson , Marble 's boss at Fleet Numerical . " Once I was ( on a ship ) in the middle of the South China Sea . Climatology says it is n't foggy there  --  never ! We could see little thunderstorms all over , which means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fog . <p> " All of a sudden , the foghorn is sounded , and the visibility goes to nothing . " A dense fog swallowed the ship . The ship 's furious commander got on the intercom and bellowed : " Meteorologists , to the bridge ! " <p> What had happened ? In retrospect , Gunderson thinks that recent typhoons had passed through the South China Sea , causing the ocean water to spin . The spinning forced deep , cold ocean water toward the surface , where it cooled the moist , warm air . <p> Result : the kind of blinding fog that , in wartime , could have made the difference between victory and defeat . <p> " That 's probably a local phenomenon that people over the South China Sea see all the time , " Gunderson notes . " But it did n't even make it into the ( Navy ) handbook . " <p> The moral of the story : Despite all those costly supercomputers , local forecasting still relies on " local experience and knowledge , " says Marble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't have a computational substitute for that yet .
