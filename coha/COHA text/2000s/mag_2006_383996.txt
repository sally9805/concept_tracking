" It was a really hard trip , but people appreciated that we had come to hear what happened to them , " Cornelia Carey , director of the Craft Emergency Relief Fund , says of what she witnessed on a weeklong visit to hurricane-ravaged Mississippi and Louisiana in January . Accompanied by CERF board member Craig Mutt , Carey had set out to get a firsthand look at the status of relief efforts , and to learn howthe fund could fine-tune its recovery aid to craftspeople . " Half the artists we encountered are in the basic recovery stage , survival mode , " says Carey , who kept a blog during the trip . " We met some potters in Mississippi who were living in the back of their van because the FEMAtrailer the Federal Emergency Management Agency 's temporary housing had n't arrived , " she recalls . " There were people who did n't lose their homes but who maybe had four feet of salt water in their houses for 10 days . And if you did n't lose your home or studio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you have the lost jobs at universities , the local art institutions struggling-the layers of it are unbelievable . " As of January CERF had taken in nearly $300,000 in mostly unsolicited donations for Katrina victims , and had given outover$100,000 in emergency cash , which , Carey figures , most used for pressing necessities like rent . " We anticipate needing to raise another $300,000 for that next step of getting people back into studios and rebuilding . It 's a long-term commitment on CERF 's part . " Besides donating , how can the public help ? " Employ people . Buy their work , " suggests Carey , pointing to the craft fair at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival as one place to start April 28-30 , May 5-7 ) .
