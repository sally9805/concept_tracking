<p> Daniel Snyder bought a football team , a chain of amusement parks and his own jet before the age of 40 . Now he has fixed his gaze on a new role : Media baron . <p> With little fanfare , the Washington Redskins ' owner flips the switch today on his latest venture : a collection of three small radio stations that will broadcast Redskins games , ESPN chat programs and an afternoon talk show hosted by former Redskins running back John Riggins . The three stations will go by the somewhat awkward umbrella name " Triple X ESPN Radio . " <p> The stations , which Snyder bought this year , represent Snyder 's latest effort to capitalize on his crown jewel , the Redskins , a franchise with an estimated value in excess of $1 billion . By doing so , he will take on WTEM ( 980 AM ) , until now the only sports-talk station in the area . <p> Snyder 's move into broadcast ownership follows the lead of other sports franchises that have created networks to reach fans while giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBA and NHL have all started their own cable and satellite TV networks , and Major League Baseball streams its games onto its Web site . The Chicago Cubs and Atlanta Braves have long carried their games on franchise-owned radio and TV stations , and the St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Angels recently moved their radio broadcasts onto stations partially owned by the team . <p> In an interview , Snyder said he is bullish on the conventional broadcast business at a time when other investors have turned their attention to newer technologies . With the Redskins as his calling card , he says he is interested in building a portfolio of radio and TV stations throughout the mid-Atlantic region . <p> Radio is like the newspaper business , he said  --  out-of-favor on Wall Street but still full of potential . " If The Washington Post were for sale , I 'd buy it right now , " Snyder said . " I do n't buy companies at their peak . I sell them at their peak . " <p> Snyder is counting on twin brands , the Redskins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 94.3 FM , 92.7 FM and 730 AM ) that have been broadcasting Spanish-language pop music and talk . He is betting that if he can acquire more and more powerful stations  --  he has bought one in Richmond and has a deal in the works for another in Norfolk  --  he can create a wholly owned Redskins network reaching millions of fans from Pennsylvania to the Carolinas . <p> Snyder , 41 , decided to become his team 's broadcaster last December after CBS Radio 's WJFK ( 106.7 FM ) declined to renew its $10 million-a-year contract to carry the team 's games , the most lucrative radio rights deal in the NFL . Not long thereafter , Snyder hired Bennett Zier , the top local executive at radio station operator Clear Channel Communications , and bought the three stations from Mega Communications of Florida for $33 million . <p> The question now is whether he can make it work . <p> Zier will oversee stations whose signals are so weak in parts of the metropolitan area that they ca n't be heard without interference . The AM station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must reduce its power after dark , which means it will fade out almost entirely by 5 p.m. during the fall and winter . <p> As such , the Snyder-controlled company that Zier runs , Red Zebra Broadcasting , is counting on a novel strategy : It will broadcast the same programs simultaneously on all three stations , counting on listeners to find the strongest signal by jumping from one station to the next via preset buttons . A new TV commercial for the stations , starring Riggins , attempts to make a virtue out of this deficiency . Over the sounds of the ESPN " SportsCenter " jingle and " Hail to the Redskins , " an announcer says , " 94.3 to the West . 92.7 to the East . And 730 AM all over D.C. " <p> " It would be better if there were one signal , " said Mark Fratrik , a radio industry expert and vice president of BIA Financial Network , based in Chantilly . " It does n't knock me down . . . . If you want to position yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage makes it more challenging . " <p> Zier and Snyder say that should n't be a problem . Combined , they say the three stations reach farther and with better reception than WJFK . " We 're going to be a vast improvement over sports radio in the Washington area now , " Snyder said . <p> The comment is as much a shot at the Redskins ' old station as the station that Triple X will compete against most directly , WTEM . " SportsTalk 980 , " as the station is known , is one Zier knows intimately : He oversaw its founding in the early 1990s , and was its top executive before being lured to Snyder 's venture earlier this year . <p> Since then , Zier has raided the station for talent and programming . He snatched the ESPN shows and made a string of hires from WTEM , including program director Tod Castleberry and on-air reporter Bram Weinstein . The moves weakened WTEM , which was already reeling from the loss of one of its biggest draws , Washington Post columnist Tony Kornheiser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Monday Night Football . " <p> The ESPN programs  --  including " Mike &; Mike in the Morning " and " SportsCenter " host Dan Patrick 's show in the afternoon  --  form the bulk of what listeners will hear . This , too , could prove problematic . Sports radio thrives on local sports talk , with hometown teams and personalities in the crosshairs of the call-ins and opinion-slinging . But outside of Riggins 's program from 3 to 7 p.m. and an hour-long Redskins show at noon , the stations will be carrying nationally syndicated fare . As a result , local listeners seeking the latest on the Redskins are likely to find themselves tuning in to discussions of the Dodgers ' pitching woes or the Indianapolis Colts ' rookie prospects . <p> The two competitors will be fighting over a relatively small audience  --  essentially , the adult men who are the most faithful sports-talk fans . WTEM captured an average of just 2 percent of the radio audience during the most recent three-month segment tracked by Arbitron Inc.  --  and that was with the field all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area , ranking just ahead of Spanish-language pop music on WLZL ( 99.1 FM ) and classic rock on WARW ( 94.7 FM ) . <p> WTEM generated $7.7 million in revenue last year , which put it in 20th place among local stations , according to BIA . Sources close to the station put the number higher , around $10 million . By contrast , WTOP , the area 's highest-grossing station , had estimated sales of $41 million last year , BIA said . ( The Washington Post supplies radio programming to a station owned by WTOP 's owner , Bonneville International Corp . ) <p> For Redskins game broadcasts , Snyder is keeping the popular team of Sonny Jurgensen , Sam Huff and Larry Michael . In addition to the Riggins show , other current and former Redskins players , coaches , owners , cheerleaders and other members of the Redskins family are likely to be part of the programming , all almost certainly pushing Snyder 's message . <p> " What you are able to do is control the message , not just during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where many fans keep the radio station on their radio dial and listen between the games , " said Marc S. Ganis , president of the Chicago-based firm SportsCorp Ltd. and a consultant who follows the NFL closely . <p> This raises an obvious question : Can a radio station owned by a team be a fair critic of its owner , its team and the league ? <p> " Talking Redskins works in sports talk every month of the year , but being a team-owned radio station prohibits you from being unbiased no mater what you may hear , " said Dave Pugh , who replaced Zier as regional manager of the Clear Channel stations , including WTEM . " We 've gotten calls from Redskins management regularly because of not only the fans speaking their minds but our broadcasters ' perception and opinion as well . " <p> Last year , for example , the Redskins demanded that WTEM change the hosts of its weekly chat with Coach Joe Gibbs after objecting to the tough questioning of former hosts Steve Czaban and Andy Pollin . The station complied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no holds will be barred , and that he is his own man , bolstered by an ownership stake in Red Zebra . He said he will have final say over the stations ' content . <p> Riggins , who has often been a tough critic of the Redskins since retiring from the team 21 years ago , does n't seem to be holding back . Is Snyder , his new boss , thin-skinned , he was asked during an early-morning interview at the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown last week . <p> Riggins considered the question for a moment : " He 's like tissue paper . He 's a very sensitive guy . He reacts to things . " But , he allowed , Snyder may also be misunderstood . " He made a lot of things happen at an early age , " Riggins said . " If I had done many of the things he 'd done , I would have been very confused . "
