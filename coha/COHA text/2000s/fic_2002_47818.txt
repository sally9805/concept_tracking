FOLLOWING MEHMET ALI to his meeting with the Turkish revolutionaries was a stupid thing to do . He did n't want to be followed , and I was n't very good at staying out of sight . Istanbul was his city , not mine . But I was n't trying to be superspy , I just wanted to keep the band together . When you get your last chance to play music that matters , and then you see the whole thing being flushed down the tube , you 're willing to do stupid things to fish it out and keep the music going . <p> Mehmet Ali was the one who made the band as good as it was . None of the rest of us would argue that fact , and we cut him all kinds of slack because of it . But there was a fine line between genius and dictator , and Mehmet Ali was spending more and more time on the wrong side of it . He slammed out of our session complaining that we did n't get it , we were playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just in case we did n't know , it was supposed to be rock and roll . <p> " Cehenneme gitsin , " Cevat muttered at his cymbal when Mehmet Ali was out the door . It took a few seconds for the translation to click inside my brain . My Turkish was getting better but still was n't good . " Let him go to hell . " <p> Coming from Cevat , that bothered me , because he was the mellowest drummer I 'd ever played with . He was the Buddha 's chubby baby brother , serene as landscape . I had to do something , even if stupid was the only visible option . <p> For the past few weeks we 'd been practicing in a bar on the third floor of a commercial building a block off Taksim Square . We had gone back to practicing alone . Banning fans and groupies-in-training was one of the few sensible rules that Mehmet Ali laid on us when we started to get some recognition . He said a lot about why we had to live like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus . When a musician picked up his instrument , he had to have it . That much I understood . <p> " Let him go , " Bulent told me when I started after Mehmet Ali . " You do n't want to get mixed up with that stuff , Joe . " <p> Bulent played keyboards and backed up Mehmet Ali 's vocals . He was the only trained musician in the band . He had this way of sliding out of Elton John into Beethoven and then backtracking into an old Turkish folk song that made me think of a spaceship jumping dimensions . He looked like the kid down the street you always hated because your parents thought you should be more like him . There was something middle  --  classishly neat about the guy . <p> " What stuff ? " I asked , though I knew I was n't going to get an answer . <p> I caught up to Mehmet Ali at Taksim but hung back far enough that he would n't see me if he turned around . He walked fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , late afternoon . The cold was grainy and gray and wet . After shadowing him for a few blocks , I watched him slip down a slummish alley , the kind of dead end you would n't walk down unless you had an irresistible reason to go in and a guaranteed way out . I jogged a little , then stopped before I made the turn . You 're an idiot , I reminded myself . I went down the alley after him . <p> The slick black pavement ended at two low-threshold wooden doors going into two different buildings , and I figured I 'd already screwed up , letting the finest rock guitarist and songwriter in Turkey get away from me . I stood by a pile of rancid trash , staring at the doors and wondering which one I was supposed to take . Before I made up my mind , somebody tapped me on the shoulder from behind . Mehmet Ali . <p> " Where you going , Joe ? " <p> " That 's what I wanted to ask you . " <p> He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lennon , he was the authentic Turkish version : the voice , the talent , the righteous anger . " You better stick to what you do best , " he told me slowly in English , which he thought he spoke better than he did . " Play your bass . That 's the only thing you need to worry about . " <p> " Right now , " I said , " I 'm playing my bass in the best rock-and-roll band on the planet . Whatever you 're doing , Mehmet Ali , it 's wrecking the music . Why do n't you come back to the CD ? " <p> " Fat string , " he said . <p> I did n't get it . <p> " What 's the English word ? " <p> " Rope . " <p> " Everything in the world is tied to everything else , " he lectured me . " With rope . The music , too . " He shook his head , a tad bit too dramatically for my taste . " The music is part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What was I supposed to do ? Condescension never killed anybody , but he was wrong . I had something big to worry about besides playing my bass . The music was the easy part . <p> When I went to Istanbul I was thirty years old , old enough to know that better than good is best . I 'm not saying I never wanted large success in the United States of Ecstasy : music videos and platinum CDs and limos transporting willing women , all that bright and shiny noise . But after it became clear that the pretty bliss bird was n't going to light on my branches , I realized that the music itself was why I was playing it , which makes for a circle of sound that goes around and around and around . So it was logical , in a way , to wind up in Istanbul , because the music was so good there . <p> Feature a tall American in a long coat . Bony face and a successful ponytail . He 's walking across the bridge over the Golden Horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass case he 's carrying . He 's a rock-and-roll rube with the best of musical intentions ; he 's an ignorant dagger aimed at the heart of the old city of spies and adventures and mosques . And revolutionaries . <p> What happened was , my last band at home fell apart for reasons I wo n't get into . If I say ego you 'll get the whole picture . So I took off for Europe , living cheap and playing where I could , just stay-alive music , which if you let it can actually improve your playing . Then , without thinking too much about it , there I am on that bridge over the Golden Horn in one of the world 's last exotic cities , and it turns out there is real . rock and roll going on there . <p> I was still in a slump , suffering from my MTV fantasies , which I admit is a type of sickness . Rock and roll is supposed to be music , not wiggle pictures . I spent hours dreaming up a video for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be working on . I wanted all the usual things , and I wanted them bad : the CD cover , the interviews where I was hostile and enigmatic and people thought I was a prophet . You 've seen this obsession before . I hope it bores you . <p> I snapped into focus , however , the first time I heard Beyazbulut play . They were gigging in a cheesy bar in Sultan Ahmet where the crowd was mostly European backpackers so cool-wrapped they had no idea what they were hearing was the current incarnation of rock and roll . I was critical of the bass player . He lagged . He was n't what the bass is supposed to be , the minimally visible , deep and binding low-register presence in the music . Suleiman 's bass gave no shape to the sound . <p> Most bands have an ugly tail swinging out of sight behind them in the dark . In the case of Beyazbulut , the nastiness happened when I showed up . For three nights I sat through every set , listening carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could sit in , and I was what their bass player was n't . Which was evident to everybody including Suleiman the Not So Magnificent , whose job I wanted . And got . Mehmet Ali made the personnel decisions for the band . That same night he dumped Suleiman , who went away mad . <p> I do n't feel guilty about what happened , because when I joined the band was when it came together in the holiest way . I have this theory that everybody gravitates to the instrument that tells them who they are . Mehmet Ali was a star waiting to be born . His vocals , his lyrics , and his leads were all part of the song of himself . That 's destiny , and it never bothered me . Bulent lived for the heavy intricacies of what he did with keyboards and how he fit it into the songs . He was the band 's equivalent of an intellectual . I have a harder time understanding what it is a drummer wants . It has something to do with being contrary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't talk about what I do n't know . Never mind ; Cevat was born a drummer . <p> Which leaves the bass . I 'd say it 's the glue holding the music together , but that does n't quite catch it . The bass is fatherly . It 's like the home you have to come back to eventually . The bass steadies , and it shapes , and it paints the dark colors you ca n't live without . The bass does n't rag and brag , it sustains . It 's the bed the river runs on . It 's me . In the genes maybe . At least in Beyazbulut . <p> Enough religion . The paperback version is , Suleiman got dumped , I got his job , and Beyazbulut started making music people craved hearing . Do n't get the idea this is some kind of rockumentary fading to black behind shots of us all rich , wasted , and disillusioned in some Istanbul pleasure-palace . In Turkey , rock musicians do n't become millionaires . We started writing our own stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we put out two CDs , one right after the other . The first we called Democracy in Flames , which gives some idea of Mehmet Ali 's political bent . After that came Blue Exile . Newspaper people started writing about us , which sold a bunch of CDs and pumped up the crowds in the bars where we played . We were what was happening . <p> For a while it was better than illumination . The music stayed right , stayed real , got better . I had a little money in my pocket . I learned some Turkish , and a beautiful poet with green eyes moved in with me . Her hair was the color of ash mixed into honey . Her name was Can , which is pronounced Jon and means life , and she was at least that to me . I had visions of semipermanence . First thing every morning when we woke I kissed Can 's forehead , because that 's where her poems came from , and she kissed my fingers , where my music lived . <p> Staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to peel . The longer you stay , the more skins you peel away , but you 'll never get to the core of the place . That 's why it took me so long to see what was happening with the revolutionaries , and it was only by chance I picked up anything at all . This was about the time some TV people approached us about doing a Friday-night concert show called Half a Peach . The program was national . It meant our first shot at taking our music outside Istanbul . We were putting new stuff together for the third CD . We agreed we wanted to go slow and make it come out right . <p> One Sunday afternoon in October , Can and I were at Mehmet Ali 's apartment drinking Turkish tea and talking poetry . Mehmet Ali liked to try out his lyrics on Can because she always had something blunt and useful to say . Outside , it was cold and damp enough to make you feel vulnerable , like an animal smelling its own death . The sour smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , we had lyrics on our mind ; we had escape and esthetic rapture and liberation . About five , when somebody knocked , we were halfway to philosophical . <p> Mehmet Ali went to the door and listened to some low , urgent Turkish . He closed the door softly , looked past Can and me , then hunted for his wallet . I watched him fork over a wad of bills to the guy waiting in the dark hall . <p> " What was that about ? " I asked him . <p> " About improving this shitty society . " <p> I hated it when Mehmet Ali put me off with one of his condescending nuggets . That kind of comeback belonged in songs , not in your average daily conversation . Which is not to say I did n't have a certain amount of sympathy for the whole radical thing . There have been days when I wanted to blow everything up and start the world over again . For most of us , that 's a pretty natural feeling to have . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demolition process . <p> " White Cloud , " I told him . <p> " What about White Cloud ? " <p> Beyazbulut was the name of the band . It was also Mehmet Ali 's last name . Translated , it came out White Cloud , which sounded to me like an excellent place to live if you could stay in the air for a long time . <p> " When they distribute the CD in America , " I told him , " I think that 's what we should call it . White Cloud , music by Beyazbulut . " <p> He shook his head , pretended he did n't like the idea . He handed Can the sheet of paper he 'd been writing the verses to a new song on . <p> " Stay out of it , " Can warned me as we walked home that evening , breathing in the semi-invisible coal dust and holding hands like teenagers practicing infatuation . " You do n't even want to know about what 's going on . " <p> " Yes I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " More . " <p> " They think they 're Marxists , and democracy is a sham . They think the only reason the Soviets lost was because they got soft . They think they are the only force capable of saving Turkey from the fundamentalists . " <p> " More , " I said . <p> " No more . " <p> When I started paying attention , I noticed that a percentage of everything we made was going via Mehmet Ali to his political friends , who never showed their faces . The other Turks in the band knew what was happening . At first I thought they accepted it the way you accept income tax . We had been lucky ; we started out trusting each other about money , and it never divided us the way it can divide a band . Mehmet Ali negotiated our contracts and split the money evenly , and nobody lost any sleep over it . But after I knew what to look for , I started worrying . Some serious friction was developing because we were giving our 10 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrow the state . It was n't the lost lira that bothered me ; it was the animosity eating at the edges of our music like a saw with big , hungry teeth . <p> The ironic part was , our new CD was on its way to being seventeen light-years beyond what we did on the first two . All original stuff , nothing derivative . If you 've never been involved in a creative group-project like making a CD , it might be hard to get a sense of the rush that hits you . It 's an experience of power , like finding you can reject the world that let you down and come up with one that wo n't . The feeling is more satisfying than any drug I ever tried , which is almost all of them . And Cuts , Licks , &; Bruises ( my translation ) was the best music I was lucky enough to be involved in , ever . By a long shot . <p> Things came to a head the night we did the Half a Peach concert on TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran right up to the edge of the valley of satisfaction and saw how green it was , how sunny and well  --  watered . The songs we played came out like future classics . The phone lines were jammed with people from all over Turkey wanting to ask us questions , to know when our new CD was coming out , what our favorite color was , and did the cute Amerikali bass player with the ponytail really like Turkish food ? Backstage I went to the bathroom and closed my eyes and saw our sales ascend the stairs of heaven like angels on jet skis . And there was a new bass run on its way to my fingers . I could feel the necessary itch , something Mehmet Ali could lie down on and really ride . <p> So we celebrated . We went to a bar in Tepebasi where the house band and everybody in the place gave us a standing ovation , bought us drinks , told us we were the face and the voice and the fingers of rock-and  --  roll in our time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quiet , bitter fight broke out at our table . On the surface , it had to do with the money . I tried to play peacemaker for a while , but that was hopeless . Let 's not fuck up the music , I kept saying . But I lost track of the Turkish pretty fast , and they were too hot anyway to pay me much attention . <p> We all knew that money was just the code name for what was really wrong . The better the band got , the more political and arbitrary Mehmet Ali behaved . And Cevat and Bulent were scared witless that our genius guitar player was driving us dangerously close to a violent organization whose name I did n't even know because Can told me it was too risky for me to hear . Anyway , the satisfaction of our first television gig was spoiled the same night it happened . <p> After the Half a Peach concert , Mehmet Ali started acting like a martyr to the only noble cause in the world , as though he owned political virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We got together to practice every day , and every day the music broke down into bickering . <p> " So this is what it comes down to , " Mehmet Ali said to the ceiling , shaking his head slowly . He looked like John Lennon on a day of maximum alienation . " Money . " <p> Nobody could convince him it was n't the money , because that would have meant his admitting he might be wrong , and we could n't talk about the politics behind the money , because that was too risky . It stayed like that for a couple more weeks , and I got pretty crazy . Can moved back to her mother 's apartment to get away from me , which tells you how I was handling the situation . Can 's mother hated poetry . <p> My only excuse is , I saw how fast our best chance was slipping away . The music was n't coming out easy and right anymore . It was forced . It had the wrong kind of friction in it . It limped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was trash each other . After a while , when I tried to broker peace , they all turned on me together , making me feel like the most foreign foreigner in Turkey , so I said fuck that noise . <p> We were so close , so damn close . Sales of the first two CDs were pretty good , by Turkish rock-and-roll standards . All of a sudden we had more offers to play than nights to play on . It was n't ready , but the release of Cuts , Licks , &; Bruises was being talked about like some kind of major event in the history of rock and roll . And we were letting it get away . <p> I 'm still not sure what I wanted when I followed Mehmet Ali the second time . I managed to sneak a look at an address he took down when he was talking on the phone . Ten o'clock tonight , he said , OK . He walked away from the pad of paper , and I did another James Bond number . <p> That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been overrun with immigrants from Eastern Anatolia , a hunkered mass of people waiting for their lives to get better . I did n't tell Can I was going . She would have talked me out of it . Wish she had . <p> It was cold and rainy . That same smell of burning coal was overpowering , like a permanent stain in the ragged fabric of the city air . I took a bus , another bus , a dolmus taxi , then walked . Past row on row of ugly , close-to-identical concrete monsters of apartment buildings on torn-up streets that looked , in the fog dropping down , like the day after Apocalypse . <p> It 's not like I had a plan . Can had convinced me that the revolutionaries had something on Mehmet Ali , something big enough to hold him back from his own best chance with the music . That made sense . Did I think they would listen to my plea to set him free so we could be unencumbered rock stars ? Did I think Mehmet Ali himself would listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing to say . I was n't thinking at all . I was angry and stupid . The only healthy impulse driving me was the urge to keep our music alive . So there I was on a foggy corner in a run-down neighborhood in Istanbul watching Mehmet Ali the visionary rocker walk into a mustard-colored apartment building across the street . It was like watching the music drain down a hole in the ground . <p> I did n't go in right away . For a few minutes there was a little peace , the peace of expectation , maybe . It began to rain , and I watched a pile of construction debris-boards and buckets and slabs of broken concrete-absorb the rain like silence eating sound . I could n't think , but there were pictures , and the pictures told a sad little story . Pictures of our band in bars , of the overstretched city of mosques and minarets and markets . Of Mehmet Ali scratching out his lyrics on a napkin , of Can spooning honey into her tea in the morning . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immigrants squatting in the neighborhood where I stood , expecting their future to be better than their past . If anybody had the ears to hear what the revolutionaries wanted to say , it must be them . Or maybe their kids . But at the same time I also saw a CD cover for Cuts , Licks , &; Bruises that I could never paint . And I understood that our music had nothing substantial to do with the place in which I was standing . After the pictures stopped coming , I crossed the street to the mustard-colored building . <p> What a frigging disaster of a mistake . Why is it the only mistakes you really need to undo are the ones you ca n't ? For good reasons , Mehmet Ali 's contacts were afraid of being tracked and captured . The building I tailed him to was a safe house , a place that to them meant staying alive . They must have had somebody watching the corner , so when I reached to knock on the door of 3A , it opened before my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed me , pulled me inside , knocked me down onto a bare tile floor . The tiles were damp and gritty and cold on my neck . <p> " It 's OK , " I remember hearing Mehmet Ali scream , " it 's a mistake . He does n't know anything . It 's a mistake . " <p> But I guess Mehmet Ali had limited credibility with these people despite the money his guitar made for them . Because in about thirty seconds three of them were standing over my stretched-out body beating the shit out of me . The sudden violence of the pain was like an electric shock . I think I was already unconscious by the time they stomped on my hands and broke them . <p> When I woke up the first time , there was a yellow angel in the air near me . Her presence comforted and frustrated me . The light she swam in hurt my eyes . I closed them and tried to hang onto what I had seen , but I was nauseous and dizzy , and I dissolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran so slowly I could have jumped out of the boat and run alongside it on the bank and still won the race , but I did n't have the strength for that . I noticed that everything worth anything was shining yellow . <p> When I woke up the second time , I knew it was Can . I also knew that we were n't in Istanbul . There was no traffic noise , and the air coming in through the bedroom window had the smell of the sea in it . I lifted my hands like a man being robbed at gunpoint . They were covered with big , clean , white bandages . They looked like lumps , not the hands of a bass player . <p> Can leaned down and kissed my forehead . " Do n't talk , " she told me . " Not yet . " <p> She brought some broth in a china bowl with blue and yellow flowers painted on the rim and spooned it into me . The broth went down like an assault , and I came close to heaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . <p> " On the coast , " she told me , but she did n't say which one . " It 's called Mavi Cennet . " <p> That seemed like a long conversation , as though we 'd been talking for hours , and the effort to communicate put me back to sleep . <p> For the next few days I slept more than I was awake , but I stayed awake for longer periods each time I came into consciousness . There was unbearable pleasure watching Can move around the little house , smelling her smell . And in listening to the sounds of the village we were in : kids hollering happily , hawkers hawking , doors and windows being opened and closed , brooms brushing , music and news on the radio . I wished I could make a list of the sounds , but a man with lumps instead of hands does n't make lists . <p> Can waited until I was able to stay awake for a couple of hours before she told me , " You 're going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concerned , Turkey had left me , not the other way around . <p> " They thought you were an American intelligence agent . They thought you worked for the CIA . " <p> " That 's why they did n't kill me . " <p> She nodded . " They were afraid to . " <p> " So I 'm supposed to feel lucky ? Because they did n't kill me ? Is that the idea ? " <p> " There is no idea , Joe . I do n't have any ideas at all . When you 're up to it , we 'll take you out by boat . It 's already arranged . You 'll be safe . They 're going to take you to Greece . But you do n't have to worry about that now . " <p> " I 'll go , " I told her , " but I want to talk to Mehmet Ali before I leave . One conversation with him . That 's all I need . " <p> She shook her head . " Not now . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and examined you before we left the city . He said there may be some internal bleeding . In a few days he 'll come out from Istanbul and look at you again . Until then , you 're supposed to lie still . There 's time . Mavi Cennet is a safe place . No one knows you 're here . " <p> I nodded as if I agreed with her . I closed my eyes . It was a lot of work maintaining the distinction between being awake and being asleep . The walls were low enough that I went back and forth without any effort , Asleep and awake I was attended by a blond angel . Asleep and awake I slurped chicken broth and ate fresh bread and sliced tomatoes and drank tea . Asleep and awake I was transfixed by the sounds of the village going on around me . I had never heard those particular sounds before . Maybe no one had . <p> The day before the medical student was supposed to come from Istanbul , I asked Can again whether I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't know what they were yet , but I had some things to say to him . <p> " Not now . " She shook her head , just as if I were asking for the first time . <p> It was night , and I think I was asleep when I figured it out . Can was dozing in a chair next to the bed . There was a flat board on her lap . On the board there were paper and pencils . On the paper there was a poem . A kerosene lantern burned apricot light on the bedside table between us , <p> " Joe ? " She lifted the board from her lap and set it on the floor . <p> " They killed him , did n't they ? " <p> " He was a security risk . They thought he was contaminated . It 's the way they are . They 're paranoid , and they love violence . " <p> " It 's my fault . " <p> " A murder is the fault of the person who does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You should be tired . " <p> " I need to sleep . " <p> " Sleep . " <p> So I slept again . One of the ways I knew I was getting stronger was the fact that I was sleeping more at night and staying awake more during the day , as though there was such a thing as normal and I was finding my way back to it . When I woke the next morning , I heard Can doing something in the kitchen . She was the quietest woman I ever lived with . On top of her quiet , the morning noises of Mavi Cennet were syncopated : a scrape and a pull , a call and an answer , a two-stroke motorcycle engine and a donkey braying . It took me the longest time , lying there listening hard , to understand that it was a bass run . It had n't been played by anybody yet . But I knew if I ever got my hands back , that was where I was going . If that happened , the run I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Author Affiliation
